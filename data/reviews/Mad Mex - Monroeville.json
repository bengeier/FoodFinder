{"text":"Great selection of large burritos. It's a little more chain feel than El (or is it Los) Campasinos across the street, but it still has good food."}
{"text":"Great food.  Definitely try the chickpea chili.  The atmosphere is very unique and quite pleasant."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but the margaritas were by far the worst I have ever tasted. There was a strong taste of what I can only describe as plastic, possibly vinyl. I feel like either they substituted the cheapest Tequila on the planet, or their margarita mixer must have been leaking engine oil into the mix. In all fairness this may have been some sort of one-time disaster in margarita production."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would.  I ordered the mahi mahi tacos and they were disgusting.  I'm betting they were frozen.  Could not eat them they were so bad.  Seriously thought I was going to be ill when we left.  My wife's experience was the same with a different meal."}
{"text":"For me the happy hour deals are what the deal breaker is here!  Always random opportunities for happy hour on margs which is fine with me! Happy hour for days!! When it comes to the food though, I've had 2 instances of cold chicken and cold soup as if they were sitting out for a long period of time which I get it the waitress or waiter is busy but how does it keep happening to me?"}
{"text":"My first time at Mad Mex, our server was excellent. Tortilla chips were stale and in small pieces, seemed recycled from another basket. Margarita was average. Not sure I'd visit again"}
{"text":"Great food! I ordered the mad mex fajita burrito and absolutely loved it! Def recommend others to pay a visit"}
{"text":"I like this mad mex. I went to school in Oakland, so I'm used to the small mad mex on Atwood st. I don't like the one in shadyside!!! The service and employees are terrible there. The Monroeville one actually has the Brooklyn brewery chocolate stout on tap, which I've been searching for for about two years. Food is consistently good here."}
{"text":"Ok I didn't post about this the last time this happened but enough is enough ... Staff single handily pushes out the late night business.. They won't serve you they won't ask you for anymore orders or anything after midnight this includes Saturday night. I fully understand  the bar industry since I was in it for over 10 years but when you have a full bar and your trying to push your customers out / close them out to get home earlier someone needs to be aware of this either it be management or the owners of the establishment. Since PA law does not allow you to have any specials past midnight and you have a full bar of people willing to pay full price and you try to justify to close early with a full bar no wonder why you late nights aren't even busier. You have shunned away your late night business because everyone knows you will call last call right after midnight. Now if the owners want to close at midnight I get it they have the most skin in the game in the business, but from my observations of being a customer on a couple late night occurrences it's the employees who try to rush everyone out. I just want this issue to be addressed if not I'll be probably be one of many that have decided to just go somewhere else where employees are willing to work their actual closing shifts without closing early.  Update ! They still close early nothing was done managers watch your camera's they start cleaning up make people feel uncomfortable and as people come in they make sure they notify them last call was called and act like its a favor to serve them a drink I came in with 3 girl and 2 guys it's crazy nothing has been done to fix this problem .. If your staff feels they need to leave at midnight on a weekend night maybe they should take a different shift or work another job.  Quote on quote the bartender Rene said I get out of here at 1am so she can go and drink herself ... Nice"}
{"text":"To start with, I'm from the panhandle of Florida and was in Pittsburgh for a medical procedure. It is EXTREMELY difficult for me to find vegan friendly restaurants in my home town, so when I saw that Mad Mex offered vegan cheese and sour cream alternatives, I was sold. I was wary at first when I ordered their tofu tacos and sesame tofu, because in my experience, places often do not prepare tofu well.   Let me just say, I was blown away. The sesame tofu was the absolute best tofu I've ever eaten in my life, hands down. Even my mother, who is not vegan or vegetarian and generally dislikes tofu, LOVED it. My tofu tacos were so amazingly flavorful, and I got a massive portion for $13 - more than enough to satisfy me with some left over for home. Likewise, my mother got their wings, and said they were hands down the best wings she's ever eaten in her life.   Service was prompt, our food was brought out very quickly, our server was very kind and attentive, and the prices were outstanding. I cannot begin to recommend this place enough. I might have to take annual trips from Florida just to visit here!"}
{"text":"The mexican chicken wings were NOT fully plucked, they still had feathers as they were deep fried covered in sauce. Terrible manager didn't seem worried about the wings having rogue feathers.  Not happy"}
{"text":"Food is really good. I prefer to sit outside as the indoors gets quite crowded and in the evening it's too noisy and crowded for my tastes. I do wish they had a wider beer selection though."}
{"text":"As a long-time Big Burrito devotee it pains me to write this review, but this Mad Mex location has fallen so, so far in the last couple years.   First and foremost, the kitchen has totally lost it's way.  I suspect that a mix of turnover and apathy has taken it's toll in the back of the house.  Food is no longer predictably good or even passable.  It has become a total crap shoot as to whether or not you will even get all of the basic components of your food.  As to the front of the house, Mad Mex is chronically under-staffing this location.  Our server tonight (the busiest night of the week) had all of the patio and a large zone indoors.  Being stretched so thin it was hard to fault him for being completely dismissive of our kitchen issues - he had literally 30+ other tables to deal with.    Tonight my entree was missing fully half of it's components rendering it inedible.  I pointed this out and was given a half comp for the entree.  It was at this moment that I realized I was finally done with this location.    After 3 years as a bi-weekly customer, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I won't be back to this location. I'm giving them a one star rating, but that's only because rating an establishment with zero stars isn't an option. Not only was the service slow, it was essentially non-existent. Our server was so inattentive that we had to refill our own drinks at the bar, and cash our checks out with the bartender (mind you we were seated in the restaurant portion of the facility and there were less than 10 other people there). Not to mention that they got our orders wrong and split our bills up incorrectly. They clearly don't care about customer service; therefore I don't care to give them any more of my money. Luckily Monroeville has plenty of other Mexican dining options. Take your patronage elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pretty poor Mexican food.  But I guess it answers the question that atmosphere trumps everything else for most people.  If I could rate it for the ambiance it's 5 stars but I'm a foodie for sure and haven't been back in over 5 years.  Plus it's a chain.  Blah"}
{"text":"Holy Vegan Options!  This menu is loaded with choices for the meat lover and Vegan alike.  The bar has a ton of options.  The food is great.  The staff is on point.  Plenty of parking available.  Other shops in walking distance. This place rocks and is my favorite place to eat in Monroeville, PA."}
{"text":"Only 4 because it's not awesome, but close. Chips and salsa aside, frozen drink machines aside - margs were still good - actually some pretty tasty fajitas. Split with my bro, perfect to split, extra guacamole I think for free, better than any other chain I can think of."}
{"text":"I feel really bad having to write such a mediocre review, because it has nothing to do with the food and there is only a minor likelihood that I would experience the same thing twice.  The salad I got for lunch was just okay and the price was appropriate for what I received.  However, I didn't finish it.  Mainly due to the greater atmosphere.  Two problems with this last visit:  (1) The cleanliness of the waitstaff. My waitress was covered in cat hair.  And it tainted the rest of my experience.   (2) Beware sitting outside near the plants.  On a summer day, I decided to wear shorts and sandals.  We were sat near a table with a plant on the opposite side of the divider.  The plant attracted bugs which bit my feet.  They didn't exist table-level or get near the food, but it was still a major turnoff to have to sit and fidget in my seat because I was being bitten.  By the time it was truly bothersome, I had almost completed what I was going to eat and just asked for a check.  Again - I'm sure sitting inside or having a different waitress would have been a much more positive experience, but alas, this time the bad karma just kept coming."}
{"text":"We decided to try Mad Mex after hearing good things about it from out friends. We both love Mexican food, so I was all excited about it. When we arrived, we were informed that there was a 20 minute wait. No problem, but on the way outside, we noticed that there was a free table two-person table on the patio. I figured since it was 10 degrees outside and the patio was hardly warmer, they had decided not to seat people there.   20 minutes later, we got the text that our table was ready. And what do you know? It's that same table that had been available 20 minutes earlier. Not only did we have to wait 20 minutes for no reason, but we were placed at a table that was so cold that we couldn't even take our wool coats off. There are heaters in the ceiling on the patio, but they don't really make a difference at that temperature. Whatever. I imagine this is to encourage people to drink more.  Soon after sitting down, we realized we had been placed next to a ~20-person party of high school teachers who were mostly intoxicated. They shouted and screamed at each other the entire time we were there.  Our waitress was terrible. She took our order and that's about all she did that night. She walked past us many times without saying a thing. She didn't ask us how our food was until after we had eaten it. Also, I was surprised that the restaurant doesn't serve chips and salsa with the food. What kind of Mexican place doesn't do that??  So about the food . . . I was all pumped for some amazing Mexican/Southwest food after hearing such good things from my friends. Both of us ordered burritos, which the menu indicated were their top sellers. When we got the food, it was lukewarm. I assumed that like many Mexican food restaurants, the dish would come with some sort of side of rice or re-fried beans. However, both of us received a white plate with a white burrito on it and a small plop of pico on the side. There was also an extremely ugly orange stain on the top of my burrito that was made out of some kind of flavorless sauce that I assume was supposed to look like the restaurant's logo. That was it. Still trying to be positive, I assumed that they had just put all the sides inside the burrito. But then I cut into it and found that the whole thing was literally just beans, rice, meat and (I kid you not) about three bell pepper slices.   My partner and I both agreed that there was a distinct lack of seasoning in our food. It just tasted like beans and rice and meat. I don't think they even know what cumin is.   Best part is, we paid over $10 for each of our flavorless burritos.   Next time you want a big burrito that actually tastes like something, please do yourself a favor and go to the Chipotle across the street instead. It's actually cheaper and it tastes about 100 times better and you won't have to sit in a freezer next to drunk people while you eat."}
{"text":"A great Tex-Mex restaurant. Love their food. Their beer selection isn't the largest, but it they offer many craft beers. Like the atmosphere and they have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The food was good.  The service was great!  We had a good time here but I would probably choose a more authentic Mexican place.  Nothing against them just personal opinion.  They treated us great here and I would recommend trying it if you've never eaten here, you might love it."}
{"text":"Yummm!!! Love the mad mex chain and this one is just as good as the Oakland one even though it's in the suburbs... Love me some big azz margaritas!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! I get the spinach shrimp mushroom quesadillas every time. Can't go wrong with their lunch special mon-Thursday for $10 that includes the quesadilla plus salad or soup! Service has been a hit or miss there, usually good.  Everything seems fresh and made to order. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a big Mad Mex fan, and have been to almost all of their locations surprisingly. We occasionally make it out to the Monroeville location when we meet with family. As such, we were here for Mother's Day to take part of their specials for the day.  The deal itself was great, $15 for an app, entree and dessert*. Why the asterisk? Well, the email from Big Burrito Group said \"ANY\" dessert, while this location said you only get the Mexican Brownie. All the desserts costs the same, so not sure why it mattered much. By the time we got to dessert they were out of brownies and we were able to choose a different option.  Overall, the meal fell flat on a lot of fronts... long wait times for drinks, they kept forgetting items we ordered, forgot sauce on the enchiladas, cold quesadilla, etc. And when the dessert came, well they were missing ingredients (like no ice cream in the ice cream burrito).  I think it was a great promotion, but either they were overwhelmed and/or just had a bad day."}
{"text":"THE MONROEVILLE MEXICAN MADNESS DEBATE CONTINUES...MAD MEX OFFERS VEGGIE VARIETY!  So I'm a sucker for chips and dip and margaritas and tacos! And lately Monroeville has about 8 MILLION Mexican food options most of which I have tried in the quest for chip and dip happiness. Finally got around to Mad Mex, another branch of the Big Burrito Company Genius, in Miracle Mile. I'd been there awhile ago but had never reviewed.  I think the highlight would be variety on this menu - not just same old Tex Mex stuff - alot of vegetarian options that looked tasty!   Alas, primal meat eater had the steak tacos which were great! And of course I had chips and salsa and a small classic margarita - I could eat those three things forever and become 1000 pounds of crazy!  Black beans on the side are wonderful! Beans are such a great source of tasty deliciousness!  ONTO THE DEBATE: How many Mexican Restaurants Can Monroeville Sustain? Is Monroeville obsessed with Mexican food? I don't have the answers to this but to me it's a very curious situation.  CHIPS and SALSA Forever! ;)"}
{"text":"The Service: the service was mediocre. My drink order was wrong, he mixed up our orders, and we had to steal silverware from another table. Never asked if we wanted another drink.  The Drinks: I ordered a strawberry margarita on the rocks and received frozen. Maybe it was the obnoxiously loud music. Maybe the waiter just couldn't hear me. Either way it didn't matter because it tasted off. It was definitely strong but had a weird aftertaste.  The food: carnitas nachos were amazing. I was so hungry I attacked the plate. My husband loved the carnitas enchilada. I got the seasonal special which was the barbecue burrito. It was delicious. The beef melted in your mouth. I just wish there was more of it in the burrito.   In conclusion, if you're willing to deal with mediocre service and obnoxiously loud music for some good food, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, service was great. Waitress very nice, now onto the important info. Tried the garlic cilantro wings for apps, delicious! The flavor was a change of pace from the usual buffalo sauce. Had the Mad mex fajita burrito with steak, was just okay. The overwhelming amount of rice made the burrito somewhat bland, sour cream helped a little bit. I regret not getting the grilled fish tacos I was initially told to try. Will be back for those."}
{"text":"Came in for my free birthday burrito.   Enjoying a Great Lakes Christmas ale.   Very nice.  Nachos grande were very filling.  Waiting on my shuishiterito burrito.    Should be good.   Wife ordered custom made Margarita with patron silver.   Sweet!"}
{"text":"Excellent high-quality local ingredients (better than El Campesino). My favorites are the tofu tacos and mahi mahi tacos. The kids love their children's menu because it's actual tex mex but in smaller portions (not like most children's menu fare of chicken nuggets) and it comes with celery/carrots to start and a delicious warm brownie with ice cream to end."}
{"text":"Amazing food at reasonable prices. I recommend the honey chipotle wing-o-rito.  I go here every chance I have!"}
{"text":"This particular location tends to draw in more families with children than the other locations, so it can get noisy and the acoustics are pretty bad - lots of hard surfaces.  They have a decent patio and a huge wrap-around bar so you can sit at the bar and outside simultaneously.  They tend to have sports on the TV, which is a little distracting.  If I wanted to watch baseball, I'd go to a sports bar.  If you're a hardcore fan of authentic Mexican food, this is probably not the place for you.  The enchiladas remind me more of chilaquiles - definitely more layered than rolled.  The burritos are huge but it really drives me crazy how segmented they are.  One bite will be all rice, the next will be all meat.  The tofu tacos are okay, but the bean sprouts seem like a weird addition.  I know, you're probably thinking \"What DOES this girl like about Mad Mex?\"  If you can let go of any previous Mexican food experiences (or if you've never had Mexican food before, as I hadn't when I first went to Mad Mex), some things are ok.  The tofu tacos minus the bean sprouts.  The California grilled salad.  The chickpea chili and black bean soup, the potato taquitos.  Nachos, chips & salsa, and guacamole are all decent.  Their sides are ridiculously huge and the desserts are all ok (except the sopapillas).  Basically, stick to the least authentic stuff and you should be fine.  Additionally, some of their entrees are available with your choice of either chicken, steak, shrimp, portobello mushrooms or tofu.  They have tons of vegetarian options.  They have good happy hour deals and good late night margarita deals.  They have raspberry, strawberry, mango, and kiwi margaritas year round, with one or two seasonal flavors per month, plus a full bar, a bunch of tequilas and a huge, varied beer list that tends to focus on local beers.  So basically: the less you know about Mexican food, the less disappointed you will be.  If you're a fan of authentic Mexican food, either stick to something more basic like a salad, or pick a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed with this location. From the service to the food, it has been 90% disappointing. My boyfriend & I have gone twice now,  to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke. We've gone early on a Sunday for no crowd & late on a Thursday which was quite crowded. Our first visit the wait staff appeared inconvenienced by our presence, & we made the mistake of choosing to sit by the bar,  but not quite outside. You have to be all the way outside to hear yourself think since the music, & therfore all the other patrons, is so loud! Then the wing appetizers were conflicted. The wings themselves were quite well cooked actually but the \"insane\" heat level garlic sauce had no taste & absolutely NO heat! Then the entrées, my chicken chimis (sp?) were pretty good but my boyfriend's chicken & steak Fajitas were so bad. Steak, ordered medium rare, was well done & had no seasonings & ZERO flavor. Same with the chicken. Our next visit went no better. Taquito apps were not very good, blah flavor & overcooked chewy shrimp. My tacos had very dry, overcooked Mahi (a crime that should be punishable by labor camp) & a chipotle sauce that had so much chipotle you couldn't taste anything else. The zinger of the night had to be my boyfriend's wing tacos with, again, the \"insane\" original buffalo flavor. They tasted EXACTLY  like a very mild heat curried chicken straight out of an Indian restaurant! At this I had to ask our waitress if that was the intentional flavor. She looked confused & said she would ask. Despite coming back to our table twice after that she didn't even mention it again & I wasn't bothering for an answer because I'm never going back there. I'm told the Shadyside location is good but I don't know I want to waste more $ to find out."}
{"text":"I love this Mad Mex location, my only complain is that I wish it was bigger! The service is always very friendly, and the food is great. Mad Mex has a great selection of beers, and the happy hour specials make it even better. The outdoor seating section is a little chilly in the winter, but nothing too terrible."}
{"text":"I've been to this location over a dozen times.  We love the funky atmosphere- masks and clunky artwork, outdoor seating and bar, and Mexican food with some personality and delicious variety.   It's one of our standard date night restaurants- but be prepared for a wait Friday-Saturday nights from 6-8pm.  We often get the steak tacos with salad- swap out the rice and beans- almost every time. Try the cilantro vinaigrette in the salad. Last time here we tried the fajita burrito and it was enough to share with a salad. One problem I have with Mad Mex is they charge for the chips and salsa that one expects to be free. But we have enjoyed the salsa trio- pick three types of salsa for your chips. Kind of a salsa \"flight\". The guacamole is also excellent as an appetizer to splitting most entrees."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is a good mexican chain restaurant. This particular location is very nice in terms of service. They seat you promptly and get your orders in time. I have tried virtually everything in their menu and love their enchiladas. Also, their drinks are awesome and I love their margaritas. Nice place for dinner and also if you want to chill out after work early in the evening, they do have good beer selection and chicken wings. All in all, one of the better Mad Mex locations."}
{"text":"For a limited time only they featured pulled pork tacos with friend plantains and pineapple jabanero salsa, dear god bring it back!  Otherwise the tofu tacos are SPECTACULAR.   Best fusion idea ever? Doesn't hurt that any random playlist you might hear Grateful Dead, Bright Eyes, New Found Glory and Radiohead in any random order while you dine on your favorite dish or get sloshed on the big azz margaritas.  Mad mex is the thing I miss most about Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"kind of like it here for an outdoor lunch spot.  they do have a small lunch menu and the portions are quite large.  here's the thing- monroeville is not known for mexican food and mad mex is not amazing in anyway.  i tried the chicken quesadilla which comes with a small side salad.  the chicken quesadilla had 4 large pieces and i added guac and sour cream.  the side salad was nothing memorable...bottom line is this is probably one of the best spots in monroeville.  so, if it's sunny and warm out and you happen to be in the area hungry this may be your best option....seriously."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in years and as I sit on the thrown I remember why. Horrible overpriced garbage. This was the worst meal I had in YEARS, and I have eaten 2 day old sushi left in a car. Salsa was dry and tasted old and spoiled, absolutely horrible. Grilled fish tacos were both bland and very salty. $14 for tacos and they throw you a plate of beans and rice like you are suppose to be grateful for it. The tacos were soo bad they must have known. They threw soo much sauce(1000 Island dressing?) on it that my hand kept slipping off the taco. I will never go back to this disgusting poor excuse for a dumpster. Go to chipotle and get much better food for way way less money. There is a reason Chipotle always has I long line when you go there. Same on you Mad Mex! If you are the typical un-traveled, un-adventurous Pittsburgher you will probably find this crap ok to for down."}
{"text":"I always love a good Margarita and mad mex is normally where I go to find them but lately they have tasted more like the cheap sour mix from a grocery store... but again, I won't turn down a margarita! I love the people that work here! They are always so kind and lead me in the right direction when trying to stay away from \"too spicy\"    great atmosphere and cool murals!"}
{"text":"I must first say that I've spent the last 20 years in San Antonio where GOOD Mexican food is plentiful.  That said, I've been searching for a good Mexican food restaurant in Pittsburgh and after trying Mad Mex recently - I'm still searching.  First of all, good Mexican food is cheap.  Not so here.  I ordered Chicken Mole Enchiladas, expecting the rich, creamy, chocolatey sauce I've grown to love.  I placed my order to go.  When I got home and opened my container, I thought they had given me the wrong order.  My enchiladas were covered with some orange-colored sauce which had no sweet or chocolate taste to it at all.  The black beans and rice that accompanied my order were dry and without any juice in the beans.  No flour tortillas on the side and the guacamole was bland.  The service was quick and friendly, but to spend more than $12 for mediocre Mexican food prevents me from going back again.  Still searching for good, reasonably-priced Mexican food in the 'Burgh!"}
{"text":"I normally love going to Mad Mex in the Fall for the Gobblerito. They were short staffed today. We waited 45 minutes to be seated, even though they had plenty of seating. We were told it was because they were trying to get the wait staff caught up on their tables. The hostess was very curt. I wouldn't have minded the wait, but they were not very friendly. The food was still delicious, the waitress was very nice, and the Margarita was on point! I will return, just disappointed today."}
{"text":"So, I was here about a year ago with some friends on a weekday.  We sat outside, has some food and drinks and everything was pleasant.  Last week I came here on a Friday night to meet up with some friends and it was waaay different.  The place was packed, and extremely loud.  Some may enjoy this type of atmosphere but we had to yell at each other at our table to communicate.  We ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer as we feared our food would take a while given the amount of people dining.  They were pathetic.  Basically just bagged chips, not the warm and fresh fried ones you get at authentic mexican restaurants.  The salsa tasted like stewed tomatoes.  I'm on a diet so I opted for a salad instead of my usual burrito.  Stick to the main entrees, the salad wasn't that impressive.  Everyone else in my party enjoyed their orders though.  I think if i would have skipped the chips and just went with the standard Mad Mex burrito I would have been happier.  Probably the worst part of our meal was my fiance's Margarita.  Just the standard $8 margarita...it tasted HORRIBLE.  Granted, I don't like margaritas much but i know what they are supposed to taste like.  This one tasted like low end tequila and syrup.  I doubt I'll be back to MadMex unless someone insists.  There are much better choices for this type of fare in the area."}
{"text":"Was at the restaurant last night with a few friends. I ordered a quesedea and in my food was a huge piece of glass!!! It was the bottom circle (base) of a glass bottle. The manager was called and he said sorry for the plastic you found...it was glass!!! Anyways will not eat here again. The Manager should not have lied. All of us felt it before we called them and it was glass. I wonder if I ate small pieces of glass which I didn't notice :("}
{"text":"Food was ok, not as good as I had some years ago at the Oakland location , service was really slow, and hit or miss, the noise level is rather deafening, hate the new trend in restaurants where you are supposed to scream at your dinner companions ,   Will pass on this one, honestly there is better Mexican food at a lot of the small family places."}
{"text":"Went out for drinks and apps with a couple friends to catch up. I ordered the fruit of the day frozen Margarita. The waitress brought it to the table and told basically informed me I was going to be disappointed because it really wasn't frozen. Why wouldn't you ask me that prior to bringing it out? Anyway trying to not cause waves I accept it and didn't have her take it back. I ordered the pepita hummus as a app witch is suppose to be served with flat bread and it came with tortilla chips instead. The other app was the fun guy tacquitos which were really good. The topper of the evening was when the waitress gave my credit card and bill back to another table. Thankfully I found the customer with my card and we swapped.  It was still a decent time and I still enjoyed my food however I probably won't be eager to choose mad mex as my next girls night destination."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. Great atmosphere and food! I have a gluten allergy, and have been taken care of the numerous times I have been here. Never got sick!  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what the complaints are about here. We frequent this particular restaurant often, and have ALWAYS had great service and great food. The bar staff is amazing to us and very helpful if I need a beer sample or have questions. The happy hour is the best in the area, hands down, and it's always a great time had by our whole crew.  It seems some real nitpicking is happening over trivial things, and just here to complain, I'm not sure. Every place has good days and bad, these things happen, but on the whole, we've never had a bad time or a bad meal."}
{"text":"Terrible service, got my order wrong and acted like that was mine fault, and everything is bland."}
{"text":"We were hungry but were at the point of hanger so we went to the first place we saw on yelp. This was madmex, and we had been there before with terrible service over in the Philadelphia area so I was skeptical. Tim. Oh my god, Tim. He came to the table with our water in hand and had our drink order ready within seconds. I swear to you on my future children, our appetizer and our meal were ready faster than the millennium falcon getting to its destination. We had just started on our chips with an extra sampler salsa (GOD BLESS YOU TIM) when out came the most delicious quesadilla the world had ever seen. We had begun to wonder if Tim had also done the cooking because it was so phenomenal. We had our refills and asked for our wonderful chips and salsa to go. HE SAID YES AND ADDED FRESH CHIPS AND EXTRA SALSA. EXTRA SALSA. WITH A SMILE ON THAT ADORABLE FACE GOSH TIM LOOK AT YOU. Our only regret is that we didn't have more money to throw at Tim."}
{"text":"The decor was the best thing about this place as food wasn't even average and service was below average.  Server walked by and looked at my empty drink walk by and I had to ask for a refill.  The chicken burrito had a small palm full of meat.   The guacamole was 3 tablespoons for $1.50. Chips were thick and cold and the hot sauce was just tomatoes and jalapeño.  Tortilla soup was just plain chicken soup spiced up a little with no veggies.  Last visit for me."}
{"text":"I love this place! Food,service,ambiance everything is up to the mark. Just a little too dark in the dining area that's my only suggestion is to light the place up a bit more."}
{"text":"The food here is great, and the service is good. However, orders get messed up often. It seems like this is a common issue at this location."}
{"text":"I used to love going here for dinner---magic words...used to. I was there last week for dinner on a Saturday evening. The hostess was miserable, but the food was worse. I bought a burrito.... The chicken was burnt so much that it wasn't even edible. There was supposed to be a wing sauce inside but clearly they forgot it. My boyfriend also had burnt chicken--the very few pieces of chicken they even put in it. We didn't complain to the staff, because I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have changed anything. They just lost a couple customers, as we will not return! I would give this place 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Monroeville. Good Tex-Mex. Like the fajitas, tacos, chickpea chili. Be sure to catch the half price happy hour specials and spicy guacamole."}
{"text":"Mad Max is an ok place. There is nothing exceedingly good about and nothing exceedingly bad about it. Its just another run of the mills Tex Mex joint."}
{"text":"We stopped in at Mad Mex for dinner and beers last night.  This is a pretty regular stop because I really like the beer selection. I enjoyed three different IPA's.....that might have been 1 too many. ;) The bartenders are really cool. Well at least that's the case at the Monroeville location,  Regina was our server and did a great job.  I went with a pork enchilada and the W went with a chicken burrito.  I also hit up  the turkey chili which was stupendous.  The menu is very reasonable when it comes to cost too."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is always great and the food fresh and tasty. I eat vegan, which makes it a chore to find things when dining out, but Mad Mex has an excellent array of vegetarian and vegan options. The tofu tacos rock! But do ask the waitress to make it vegan. Sometimes they cook stuff in butter, but they will substitute with no hassle."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night to grab some drinks and a bite to eat. We ordered the salsa appetizer, I had the mushroom and cheese quesadilla with whole wheat tortillas with a glass of wine, and my husband got a margarita with wings. The food, I must say was pretty good. Our waitress seemed like she was new, as she spilled our dip all over the table. She served someone else before she wiped it up. When my quesadilla came out, it looked like it was on a white tortilla-I asked, and sure enough it was. She comped the entrée for the inconvenience and apologized many times, which was appreciated. Despite these few issues, we really enjoyed our night there and I'm not sure if it's the low lighting, or the booths, but I really like the ambiance at this particular Mad Mex. I do wish they had more drink specials for a Friday night. Even so, everything was delicious and they had lots of vegetarian options. I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in Mad Mex this past weekend.  I have gone several times to many of the different Mad Mex's in the area and it has always been a solid choice albeit a bit expensive for the Cali-Mexican food they provide.  This past visit I ordered the Chopper Salad.  Quite delicious.  It came on a bed of mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, roasted asparagus, chick peas and green peas, sliced avocado, and grilled chicken for my protein.  Some of the pieces of chicken were a little too grilled, almost burnt, but it wasn't overpowering and the other ingredients did a fine job dancing around my bowl.  Very filling.  In the past I have ordered their tacos and have always been extremely pleased.  They offer free chips and salsa but this past time we were not offered them, making me think they changed that.  However after ordering and having a drinks, the bartender then asks if we would like a bowl.  Be warned their original salsa packs a punch!  I love spicy food and this salsa had me tasting nothing but heat.  I would imagine if you weren't so crazy about over-the-top heat, you would hate it.    Everything was pretty good about this experience except my last drink.  I ordered a Manhattan, Makers Mark, on the rocks.  I love a good Manhattan and this one was ok.  Tasted a little watery to me.  I always eat my cherry after I finish my drink, and this was no exception, except when I bit down and swallowed I had an overwhelmingly sour and rotten taste in my mouth.  I think the cherry had gone south, and man did it make for an unpleasant end.  I felt a little nauseous after that.  The whole way home and a few hours after.  I hope that never happens again, Yuk."}
{"text":"It has been years since I have been to a Mad Mex. My last experience was mediocre at best;however this visit was surprisingly much better than I expected it to be. Our group of 6 decided to share an order of steak nachos which was enjoyed b all. A variety of entrees were chosen, mostly burritos. The chicken Thai curry was reported as not having much flavor as it would have been expected, the enchiladas and other burritos were reported as very good. The steak and corn tacos were good but the stand out was the spicy spinach shrimp and mushroom quesadilla. The quesadilla was excellent! So I suppose it may be depending on what you order. Service was fast, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"There is usually a certain amount of wait time when going there for dinner I've noticed. I love the food!! I also love the fact that they have more choices in seafood or vegetarian food compared to other Mexican food. The staff is always friendly any given day even when they are the busiest. Love the atmosphere and the interior decor is amazing. I've been coming to this location for past 3+years. Still my fav. Place to eat."}
{"text":"$3 happy hour margaritas = I'm automatically a fan.  This visit was mostly to grab drinks as a birthday celebration, so I didn't really get the full experience.  I'm a sucker for a good margarita, though, and they're not easy to find.  I ordered a strawberry margarita on the rock and was very happy with the it-- it was mixed well with decent tequila and the strawberry part wasn't cloyingly sweet.  As a bonus, it turned out to be half-price, which is always a pleasant surprise.    The birthday girl's shrimp fajitas looked excellent.  I just had taquitos because margaritas on an empty stomach is a bad plan, and they were good-- I just tried the black bean and potato version, but it seemed promising for the rest of the menu.  Mad Mex is a bit of a drive for me, but I'd definitely be open to making a repeat visit and trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"If you're in the Pittsburgh area, you NEED to try Mad Mex. It's a elevated Mexican restaurant and bar and by elevated I mean the best, biggest sized portions, best drinks elevated. First off, the food is HUGE I don't think I've ever finished my meal! all of the food is high quality and they have plenty of things for everyone's taste. The drinks they offer are so good, and they are always having events and happy hours that are based around the drinks. I promise if you go here you won't be disappointed, just know you'll probably have a box to carry home !"}
{"text":"3rd time here.  I keep thinking I'm going to like it more than the last time.  Eh....not so much.  It's not terrible, but service is not great, the ladies' restroom was not clean (6 pm), the food was just so-so.  I'm going to find that \"great\" Mexican restaurant yet!"}
{"text":"We had lunch yesterday at Mad Mex.  Since we were having one more nice day before the rain and cool weather set in, we chose MM for their patio seating.  We split one of the lunch specials.  I had the black bean soup and we shared (thank god) the massive Carnitas burrito with pork slow-roasted in garlic, cilantro, chipotles and Dos Equis. Fresh, roasted green chilis inside, blue cornbread, pico and sweet-n-sour slaw on the side.  We each also had one of their Original Margaritas which was too tart for my liking.  The black bean soup was only O.K.  Many years ago TGIFridays used to have awesome black bean soup, but for some reason, they never put it on the menu.  You had to know to order it.  That became my gold standard for black bean soup.  But I digress, if you have a craving for good black bean soup, forget about MM.  Buy a can of Goya's version, heat it up, add some diced onions, a little shredded cheddar, and give it a splash of Sherry and you will have a much better black bean soup.  The Carnitas burrito was massive, certainly more than enough for two people to share for lunch.  At first we thought it was filled with mostly rice (well, actually it probably was), but we found enough pockets of the pork buried under the rice to satisfy us.  I loved the blue cornbread, but my wife didn't, which worked for me cause I got to eat her share.  We both loved the taste of the sweet-n-sour slaw.  Service was a bit slow, and I had to ask twice to get a glass of water, but for a place of this price-point, service was adequate.  Based our our limited sampling of their items, it's not really fair to generalize, but I have a hunch MM serves up quantity rather than quality. Pros:    Decor, patio seating, inexpensive Cons:   See above"}
{"text":"Yet another solid jewel in the Mad Mex group.  I love the Mahi Mahi salad and the beef fajitas.  Great selection of beer on tap, including East End Brewing selections."}
{"text":"Whenever i'm in town i never leave before i have mad mex's casa salad and chickpea chilly...  I ordered the same for dinner take out . I was disappointed to cone back home and see that my salad had just tomato and lettuce and old raw onion rings . Where are the pine nuts and cheese!!! The chilly was good. Will think twice before i get a take out here again.. :("}
{"text":"Hip eclectic Southwestern cuisine that parallels the restaurants decor. I would recommend The Chimi."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is the best place to be for a vegetarian in Monroeville. On Friday and Saturday evenings the wait time is insane and the bar is standing room only, but once seated, the service is generally great. Kid's meals are cheap and come with dessert, which is a big deal if you're 5. Nice draft selection, damn good maragaritas."}
{"text":"Great Tex-Mex food (not real Mexican...but that's okay).  The burritos and wraps are amazing as is there salsa.  I never had anything here that I didn't like.  They are also famous for their big ass margaritas.  Oh so good.  They come in a bunch of different flavors and also have rotating seasonal flavors.  The only thing I don't like about this location as opposed to the original in Oakland is this one is more family oriented and where the one in Oakland is more oriented towards 20/30 somethings."}
{"text":"Lunch was really excellent today! In the past it has been hit or miss, but today, Perfect !!!   I loved the Chicken Wrap with fries. I also liked my daughters Steak Burrito.   Our server was great, and attentive. The food was hot, quick delivery and delicious!   Highly recommend!! We sat inside today was a bit hot and muggy to be outside, maybe next time. I want the Big Azz Margarita also !!"}
{"text":"Chicken tacos were okay. Waffle fries are always good. Service was average. Great beer specials."}
{"text":"I went into this restaurant on a Wednesday night and was told there would be a 30 minute wait.  Instead of waiting, my fiancé and I found two seats at the bar.  We promptly ordered our dinners and sat patiently for our food. 15 minutes became 20 minutes. 20 minutes became 30 minutes.  And finally, 35 minutes after we ordered our meals arrived.   For a Wednesday evening, I found the wait to be excessive.  I'll give credit to the bartender, Ashley, who apologized for the long wait.  She was doing her best, but the kitchen was slow and/or understaffed.    I'm not sure I'll go back on a weeknight.  Might not be the best spot to drop into on a weeknight for a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is a solid choice for drinks and dinner with friends or family. The environment is fun and margaritas are good and strong. They also have a nice draft beer selection as well as tequila choices.  Burritos and salads are very good, along with the pic a dip a for an appetizer.  Chips and salsa are plentiful."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend yesterday. Clean. Comfy love the atmosphere! We were stuck there during a storm so we didn't mind. Our server was also very friendly and attentive, too. Got three chicken tacos..it was good but what rated this 4/5 starts was the lack of guacamole for 1.50 that couldn't be reasonably divided among three tacos; it was a tablespoon (like really?? Fork it over). I didn't say anything cause my friend was there and I didn't want to piss the server off. Lol. But I won't be adding guac anymore."}
{"text":"I keep wanting to like this place but it's just not happening. Although it is a great location for happy hour and offers a nice variety of beers, the food is what keeps me away. No matter what I try on the menu, I find it all underwhelming or bland. Even the chips and salsa that they offer you at the bar are mediocre."}
{"text":"We returned, and I was again very happy with the experience.  It was a rainy Monday night but they were packed, and there was a 30 minute wait, but we had not called ahead. The beer list was varied and interesting.  The food, including appetizers like fried tofu, was excellent. I just had a bowl of soup and a kale salad and these did not disappoint. Waiter was very helpful and quick. All in all, another great experience here."}
{"text":"I can't believe how many Mexican and tex mex places there are right in the Monroeville area.  That being said, I'm very glad Mad Mex is there!  I wasn't sure what to expect as I was told it is \"different\" and that was a very accurate assessment.  The menu has many of the typical mexican items, but most are featured with a fun twist.   I love that there are a variety of salsas and dips to choose from.  My favorite is the pineapple habenero.  It is sweet put really packs a punch.  The chips are great, but my favorite appetizer is the tofu.  It was perfectly flavored and the peanuts provided a nice added texture to the dish.  The portions are huge and tasty.  Fresh (and when possible, local) ingredients are used.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"A different vibe than other Mad Mex restaurants. Food was decent and service was not too bad. I had chicken fajitas and a margarita - let's just say you cannot go wrong with a Mad Mex Marg. Love love love."}
{"text":"The Mad Mex experience started with a whimsical desire for margaritas and a hunger for a very late lunch/early dinner.  The portions are massive, in keeping with true Pittsburgh form, and the Mad Mex margarita is a whopping 22 oz frozen monster, which we had topped with an extra shot.  Andrea and I had two 16 oz baby margaritas on ice first (also with extra shooters) before moving on to the big boy.  We tried the trio of dips, with the black bean and pineapple habanero coming in first, and the guacamole trailing.  My obsession with mole sauce was peaked at the sight of a mole chicken burrito which I ordered.  Elie opted for the steak fajitas and andrea had the steak burrito.  The food was fresh and good in quality, and by the time Allejandro arrived we suggested he have his burrito without rice which made it perfect. All in all, will definitely come back when I'm in town; we sat and drank and ate for 3 and a half hours, and not once did anyone rush us despite the crowd.  That's good service :)"}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area. My husband is a HUGE mexican fan. I'm an okay mexican fan. Neither of us had ever been to Mad Mex prior to our first trip here.   We will be returning! The staff is super friendly. The first thing I take notice is how my children are treated. If they are treated great...you've got me. They were treated like little princes. They were absolutely delighted. The waitress talked to them when taking our orders.   The food was hot, it was really good, our beverages (we both tried the blackberry margaritas) were so good.  We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I love Mad Mex (and, no it's not really Mexican food, but more like Tex Mex) I have been frequenting the restaurants for 23 years . . . And am hopelessly devoted to Big Burrito. That said, I like the food at this location best.  Honestly, I kind of wish I didn't because there are other locations closer to me or with better ambiance.  But, for some reason, this location always nails it . . . Whether you're ordering a burrito, tacos, some new addition to their menu or just some wings and chips. I can't say what makes the food just a bit better, but it always is!"}
{"text":"Nah this place is like taco bel just more expensive. If you think this is good Mexican food is think again."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and great food.  Finally a Mexican joint that wasn't opened out of a kit. The decor is kinda neat too.  So much better than the typical local Mexican places that serve refried beans with every dish. I can't say if it's authentic exactly, but it sure is good."}
{"text":"As a first timer, I had an overall good time. Definitely can't say that it's authentic Mexican dining, but an absolute fun and tasty experience.  Likes: The outside dining gave a more relaxed feel for devouring the food and being able to inhale some fresh air. Or for those who prefer indoor dining, the decor is very eccentric and odd to examine the modernized yet Aztecan influenced artworks. Mixed drinks were superb without it being over powerful or heavy to digest with food, even with or without the salt rim. The employers were real down to earth and friendly people, much props to them and their tiresome work.   Dislikes: This place is heavily compact in space and too dark to dine later at night. Seatings were definitely too close for comfort especially not being able to hear your own conversations if you happen to be dining with company. Noisy atmosphere at times due to them being a hangout area."}
{"text":"While out shopping and running errands, my husband and I decided to stop here for a late lunch today...I have only been to Mad Mex on a few occasions years ago and my husband has never been. We had a coupon for his birthday...up to $30 for one entree. And, while I know that this can be used at one of The Big Burrito Companies many other more expensive locations, due to time restraints and my husband's work schedule, we decided to try Mad Mex, since it's closest to home.   I asked the waitress if the $30 coupon would go toward the least expensive entree and she said no, she'd put it toward the more expensive one, which I thought was cool. I got the steak and chicken fajitas, which came with rice, sour cream and guacamole, and veggies. Since it would be considered part of the \"free meal\", I added the 6 jumbo shrimp. My husband got the Chicken Mole Enchiladas, which came with rice, black beans, and sour cream.   Both of us thought our meals were good, not over the top delicious, but not bad at all. I tried a bite my husband's chicken enchilada. It was okay, I just wasn't wild about the sauce. My chicken, flank steak, shrimp, and veggies were cooked just fine.   The service was good and our food came out rather quickly. The only two reasons I can't give this place 5 stars is first of all - the bathroom wasn't the cleanest. Sort of gross, actually. And, two, my meal, which would have technically been $21.50 ($15.50 for fajitas and $6 for the shrimp skewer) if not for the free coupon, was, well...lacking. Everything tasted good, but there was definitely a lot more sauteed onions and peppers than there was chicken and steak. If we would not have had the coupon and I would have received the amount of meat that I did, I would have been upset. (On the contrary, my husband's enchilada, which was $4 less, was a huge portion.) However, since our meals, with two drinks and tax, came to less than $20, we were pleased with what we got."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.   Had the spicy burrito and the hippie quesadilla. Everything was great and our server Anna was fantastic.   Everything was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"No matter which Mad Mex location you visit you are going to have a good meal and leave happy and full.  My favorites are the fried tofu appetizer, the shrimp and spinach quesadilla or one of the AMAZING burritos.    Mad Mex is high on the cool factor.  Their food is reasonably priced and well made.  Their bar is stocked with great craft brews, including local fare like the East End Brewery, and they make some decent margaritas.  Their margarita of the month right now is an apple cider margarita with the rim sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon.  Come on, can you get more amazing than that?"}
{"text":"After a disappointing experience a couple years ago at the Shadyside location, I knew that we needed to give Mad Mex a second chance, considering personal recommendations and the restaurant's testimony to its own success with 7 different locations in the Pittsburgh area.  After begging my husband to go with me to Babies R Us and Target on a Saturday evening, I promised him drinks and appetizers after we were done shopping.  We arrived ten minutes before 10pm. I knew that all of the Big Burrito restaurants had an early happy hour - 4:30 to 6:30 here at Mad Mex - but was delighted to learn that they also had a 10pm late night happy hour, too. The late night happy hour is Big Azz (22 oz) Margaritas for $7 (reg $9.50). I was a little concerned about the Margaritas because I had been disappointed in them at the Shadyside location. Well, my husband got the original frozen, and I got the original on the rocks. Both were muy delicioso!  For food, we split a Pickadippa appetizer, which consists of an option of 3 dips with tortilla chips for $8. We tried the XX Cheese, Guacamole, and Fire-Roasted Tomato Chipotle. All three were very tasty and the flavors complemented each other nicely. I also ordered the Casa Salad. Though petite, it was well worth it's $4.50 price tag. I loved the Blue Cheese - which they didn't scrimp on - and the Lime-Cilantro Vinaigrette (that the waitress recommended) was delicious. It was dipping dressing good!  Overall, I had a great experience from service to food. I can't wait to return and try more things!"}
{"text":"Stopped today in between appointments to grab a bowl of turkey chili  which is usually off the hook good.  I knew I should have left after waiting 10 minutes for someone to wait on me. And the chili was served barely warm.   Bummer!!"}
{"text":"Unique menu with a fun and hip atmosphere.  I've been here a few times and each time I've ordered something new and each time I've expected what I would normally get at a Mexican restaurant.  This is a mistake because they definitely put their own spin on each dish.  Some of it works and some doesn't.  I didn't care for their mole sauce much but was pleasantly surprised by their Chimi.  I feel the portion size and the quality is fair given their prices.  I've never been displeased but haven't been blown away either."}
{"text":"I don't like this location. The service was aweful. The waitress had such a fake attitude. People at the next table were engaging in lude behavior. Gross. And the final blow...my credit card number was stolen and used to buy itunes. I called the restaurant and explained that their place was the ONLY place I had used the card. The manager was concerned and took all my information...I had my receipt...and promised to look into it and get back to me. Three weeks later I called back to follow up because no one had called me back. This manager had not even heard of my situation and there was no documentation of my experience anywhere to be found. Again he promised to call me back. I never heard from him again. While I know the credit card company is not holding me responsible for the fraudulent charges, the lack of response from the restaurant is troubling. They have no way of communicating to staff when there is an issue. All they could do was insist it couldn't have been their employees."}
{"text":"The inside of Mad Mex is very nicely designed. Their authentic mexcian food is pretty good. The downside is the price of booze is very exspenive."}
{"text":"I remember liking Mad Mex a lot more when I was younger.  I had not been in a Mad mex for about 8 years and I have to admit that while the service was pleasant and attentive, the food of good quality and the restaurant being well kept I found the whole experience mediocre.  The food has not changed much is forever and I found it fairly bland.  I got a burrito that while very large I didn't finish.  My wife got a quesidilla that was borderline on being sent back as it had tons of onions,  All in all an O-K experience, but I doubt I will be going back."}
{"text":"I have never really been a fan of Mad Mex.. But when a friend suggested for us to come here.. I agreed. It was super packed and they only had space on the patio available. In December I was a little worried but their heaters worked great and I wasn't cold. I ordered their boneless wings, because like I said I really don't care for their style of \"Mexican food\". I was starving and looking forward to my meal- something that surely couldn't be messed up... Right? No. First of all I got 5 \"wings\" for $9!! The wings here dry and barely had any sauce on them. They tasted okay but the presentation was horrible and for the price I was not satisfied. Service was average. Nothing exceptional and nothing horrible. This place has earned another strike against it for me."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is such a great place for happy hour with their appetizers that are good for groups to split and very good beer selection"}
{"text":"So I love Mad Mex. Always have always will. Every time we come to the Mad Mex in Monroeville there is some slight issue. Perhaps the drink order got screwed up, our table got overlooked for the first 15 minutes of being there, our food took over an hour to come out, the chips never got refilled - whatever. This most recent visit was no different. I ordered what I order every time (the tofu wrapture with honey BBQ sauce) and this time the sauce was wrong. You know how when you're just so looking forward to the food because it's been a while and that first bite is expected to send you to heaven? Didn't happen for me. I still finished it because it was good and I was so hungry but it just wasn't what I wanted. So again, I do love Mad Mex and I'll never stop coming here, but there's always something. I've never had an issue at the Philly or Oakland Mad Mex but the Monroeville and Greentree ones don't quite cut it. Especially the Monroeville one."}
{"text":"My server and her manager did remedy part of the situation by comping my meal.  The particular situation being that the seasonal offering of Grill Street Corn and Steak tacos came with no corn but lots of purple cabbage stuff.  I didn't open them up to look until almost finished, then wondered about it and asked my server.  The response, though refreshingly honest, was surprising -- \"that's the 3rd time tonight\".  Wow.  I'd say \"Somebody's 'not' in the kitchen with Dinah\"...    Anyway, I did want to downgrade my last review as I had really liked this place in the past and it had been a long while since visiting.  This visit was a disappointment all the way around.  I ordered a regular margarita and did not finish it.  It was way too something... Too limey, I think.  Unlike any other margarita I've downed and not in a good way.  Then the food order took forever to come to our table, regardless of being crowded or not.  And the tacos, well, I've already mentioned no corn whatsoever and then loads of the purple cabbage stuff to cover up the fact that there was little steak and hardly any sauce.  And the choice of music and volume level, well.... whatever.  While I do appreciate being comped for my meal and they have free wifi (but you have to ask for the password), it just wasn't enough to overcome other poor factors on this visit when there are other Mexican food options in the near vicinity."}
{"text":"Enjoying a bowl of red bean turkey chili.  It has the right amount of spicy heat, beans and meat.  The dollop of sour cream is a nice accompaniment. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I love most of the Mad Mex locations that I've tried.  I think this is my 2nd favorite, next to Oakland... or this one might be tied with North Hills.  This one has an outdoor bar & patio which I love... but North Hills is closer to my house.  I loved their Horny Toad Margarita, which unfortunately is no longer on the menu.  But if you get an old timer, they'll still make it for you.  The closest thing to the Horny Toad is the Ultimate.  If you like a wicked sour margarita, this is the one for you.  I'm not a fan of the big azz margaritas that are popular there, they're  just too sweet for me.  The red sangria rocks!!  There's always and awesome selection of drafts and bottled beers too.  I like this location because it's really small and really dark.  I know that's not a plus for lots of people, but I like it.  I love the Insane San Francisco Wings with Blue Cheese.  We always order them well done.  Insane is the highest on their heat scale, the heat level isn't consistent, but it's usually pretty hot.  The blue cheese is a perfect balance to the garlicy San Francisco sauce.  My husband almost always gets the Chicken Chimichanga, its generously stuffed with tasty chicken, it's always nice and crispy.  I love most of the quesadillas and fajitas... but I think my favorite entree is the Dance Marathon Enchiladas.  I love the garlicy portabello mushrooms and spicy spinach.  The tortilla soup is thick and creamy and so good.  The casa salad is awesome with the Lime Cilantro dressing.  A garlicy spicy creamy pesto-type dressing that is also great to add as a dipping sauce for quesadillas and taquitos.   The salad is a simple combination of leaf lettuce, cherry tomatoes, red onions, blue cheese crumbles, green pepitas... the crunchy pepitas with the salty, tangy blue cheese topped with lime cilantro dressing... YUM!!!!  One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a month. Happy hour is a great deal. Servers are great with the kids. Anytime something was wrong or we didn't like they took care if it ASAP. Love all the seasonal dishes they have. My coworker says I eat here more than I cook."}
{"text":"I am a fan of all of the Mad Mex establishments in Pennsylvania.  I have been to all of them here in western PA and they are deliciously consistent. I am in Love with the grilled fish taco.  It is made with meaty Mahi Mahi not some cheap swai or breaded junk.  I dream about these tacos.  They also have amazing margaritas (& full bar) and if it is happy hour, well.... you get a BIG glass Margarita for $7.00.  That's worth the check in.  This is Fresh Mex...(not Taco Bell junk & although I like Chipotle, it pails in comparison) Their menu is extensive and there is something for everyone.  I mean everyone.  Kids too. :)  However; if I may, don't sell yourself short, get a grilled fish soft taco and a Margarita, its Mexican perfection.  I promise you, you will be back."}
{"text":"It has parking. The reservations are stored on an iPad. They're not afraid of spice. And with that, I think I've listed the things I like about Mad Mex. The menu has a lot of potential, but not enough to outweigh a significant wait at 8:30 on a Friday night. It's good enough, but not so good I want to go out of my way to brave the crowd and the noise to eat dinner on a European schedule. If you're in the right frame of mind and have a margarita in you, your mileage might vary."}
{"text":"Stopped in here a couple of months ago during a convention with some buds. Usually into Mexican food, so decided to grip and rip it.   Ordered some cheese dip and chips ($7.75) and a couple of entrees. I went with the super burrito- Bc if there's one thing (besides pizza) that I can put away? It's Mexican.   I polished it in about 5min with chips and water breaks sprinkle in between. The burrito was well stocked and definitely filled me up ($10.75), and I would recommend it to the avid Tex-mex aficionado.   Also I will say is the wait staff was very good. Would recommend this heavily"}
{"text":"Wow.. why have I been living in Pittsburgh my whole life and never ventured to Mad Mex.  All my college peers would always talk about it in Oakland, but I just never went, and some of my friend have even talked about it as a great bar and food spot, but once again I just never went.  I am an idiot because I have been majorly missing out.   Mad Mex is not just another Mexican restaurant; it is much, much more.  It is an awesome drinking spot, with great American bar food, like wings and even fried tofu.  Please do not turn your nose up to the thought of actually liking tofu.  I do not know what it tastes like out of a box/can/or whatever, but when it is dipped in hot oil and soaked in peanuts and sweet soy sauce, it is heavenly.  Their dips and salsa are also fantastic, and I was happily surprised when I learned that they were willing to refill not only the chips, but also the paid-for salsa.  I had to try out these wings that I have heard some pretty great things about.  Yes, it is a Mexican based cuisine restaurant, but they do have some banging wings.  The sauces are not your usual hot, garlic, and BBQ.  No, the sauces are spun with delicious ingredients.  I had to go with the Southwestern, which was made with olive oil, garlic, and cilantro.  They were fantastic.  Not to mention, if you go during their happy hour, 4:30-6:30, they are half off!  I can't wait to go back, and for anyone who wants to get me one of those delicious margaritas to celebrate my 21st, we only have 78 more days.  I'll meet you at the bar."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for the beer/margaritas, so this is solely a review of that.  Decent beer selection including some nice breweries like Southern Tier and Green Flash. After a few of those, we realized we were there during their late night Happy Hour so got a frozen Raspberry house margarita (I got no shame in ordering girly drinks as long as they've got tequila in them).   Only bummer is that they close up by 1am. Where's the after hours club in Monroeville?"}
{"text":"I've only had food from the Mad Mex in Shadyside and the Mad Mex in Oakland, but this one is a bit easier to get to from my location, so we hit it up. The first thing I noticed was that everyone was crowded into one area of the restaurant - the bar. I thought this was the entire restaurant, but when I went to the bathroom I noticed that the entire back end of the place was empty. What? I don't want to sit by belligerent and sweaty drunks if I can avoid it, so I'm not sure why my boyfriend and I were crammed uncomfortably up front with everyone else.   Complains aside, I ordered a Big Azz Margarita in strawberry mango flavor at the recommendation of my boyfriend and the server. It was 22 ounces for $7, which is a helluva deal in my humble opinion. I think I underestimated the potency of a sugary margarita on an empty stomach. I thought I wanted a second one, but my boyfriend kindly suggested that I hold off. I'm glad I did, because shortly after that I felt the wave of nausea and drunkenness. In all fairness, the nausea wasn't brought on by poor drink-making skills or a sub-par product. I had my gallbladder removed last year, and strong alcohol is generally not appreciated by my body.  Storytelling aside, I can't remember what my boyfriend ordered, but I ordered a plate of nachos. I know nachos are typically MASSIVE PORTIONS in restaurants, but nothing could have prepared me for the intensity of THESE nachos. And I stupidly requested extra-sour cream.   When the nachos were placed before me, I'm pretty sure I made a ridiculous and contorted face. Where should I begin? Where do these things end? Should I share them? It smells really good, omg, I can eat all of these. Wait. No. I can't do that. I definitely can't do that. But they're so good! At the end of our meal, I still had over half of my nachos left, and I packed them up for home.    I love Mad Mex, but this location doesn't appeal to me as much. They do seem to have a few variances on the menu for vegetarians though, and I can appreciate that. I'll probably go to the Shadyside or Oakland locations in the future, but that's just neighborhood bias."}
{"text":"Not all that kid friendly. They are scared of the masks on the wall. Chips are great and salsa is ok. Food is pretty bland, though. Out server was unusually helpful and nice, though."}
{"text":"Quality food. Fun vibe. Consistently good. Love the Gobblerito at Thanksgiving. It's a great place to meet for lunch. The big round tables are cozy and make conversation possible in a noisy atmosphere. Go there. You'll like it."}
{"text":"The seafood taco, and portobello mushroom salad are both well worth the long wait for a table."}
{"text":"I read aother reviewer say, \"I sat there thinking the lowest is 2 stars\", because the décor is fantastic.  A top-notch environment.  Waitress Cassi was great even when busy.  But the problem is the food is not like any Mexican I've had in México, Texas, New York, Chicago, AZ or assorted Mexicantowns.  I've discussed with some locals her that the draw is the margaritas.    My \"super spicy\" burrito was garbage.  Where was the 50 cents of super spicy sauce?  Pitting Chipotle's burrito against these burritos would be a bloodbath comparison.  I asked Cassi where the cheese was an she said it melted.  I'll upload a pic - I'm telling you I don't think there was one bit of cheese on that thing!  Unmarinated garbage chicken, no flavor, no super spicy.  Bland tomato salsa.  I'm gonna return and have margaritas and try to rate higher because my burrito was garbage.  The service and décor very good."}
{"text":"One of a pair of headbangin' friends is vegan, and when the three of us passed through Monroeville en route to Greensburg for a show, we really had no other choice off the tops of our skulls but Mad Mex, and overall, my experience was a rung above my last one nearly 3 years ago.   Not really knowing what in Perdition to order for myself, I closed my eyes and planted my finger on the Grilled Chicken Torta, and was rather pleased with it after scarfing down the last morsel. An exercise in shamelessly inauthentic fusion, this take on the torta is essentially a Mexican shawarma, the sandwich was filled with pleasingly charred, seasoned, and tender chicken breast, hummus, alfalfa sprouts, pico de gallo, lettuce, Monterey Jack cheese, and red onion with a chipotle aioli served on the side for dipping. A spicy, creamy, meaty, crunchy mess of flavorful, hearty fun, the \"pita\" or \"tortilla\" was as pillowy as that which holds shaved lamb in the Mediterranean, and the orange, doctored-up condiment played the role of tzatziki with devil-may-care irreverance. Furthering the heresy was serving of waffle fries so hash browns-meets-mashed potatoes, I was wondering if a collaboration with the Original Hot Dog Shop was occurring.   Of course, I also had to have a serving of what is the apex of guacamole in Pittsburgh. The avocado was left chunky. Tomatoes, chili, and lime accentuated the lardy texture and taste without overpowering the superfood. The chips were freshly dunked in hot oil for a spell. The salsa was typically fruity and left a light spank on the tongue.   The Authenticity Police can go after Taco Bell for all I care. Leave Mad Mex be. What they do isn't about tradition. It's about good times and delicious food. So get over thyselves, foodies.   P.S. The service was fine."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more, I gave it two chances. This review is based solely of happy hour and appetizers. Came here to start the birthday weekend. Ordered a strawberry margarita, watched the bartender pour a gross amount of strawberry mix in a cup and then full it with the generic frozen margarita. The margarita was so syrupy it was simply not enjoyable. That being said the craft beers on happy hour are a steal! I ordered some wings, they came out barely warm and completely overcooked with almost zero sauce. I asked for more sauce which they gave me, but it didn't seem to help. The sauce flavor wasn't that special either. Lastly, the service is not that great. Maybe they are understaffed? But I always had a long wait to get a re-fill. I will probably give it another shot maybe for dinner, but from what I've seen so far it's, nothing to special."}
{"text":"I typically love Mad Mex. In fact my whole family loves their food and I've craved their big azz margaritas. However the service at the Monroeville location has been horrific the last three times I've gone. I'm a nice person and I'm never rude or unforgiving with waiters but twice I went and I've been ignored by the server the entire time I was there. I mean what should have been a half hour visit for drinks turned into almost two hours. The last time I went for a special occasion and the waiter got both my boyfriend's and my drinks wrong after making us wait twenty minutes at a low key time. He then got one of our main courses wrong by bringing the wrong meal and hardly apologized for it. I normally don't mind but when your spending 80 + bucks on a meal you expect decent service. While the food is four stars the service here just isn't worth it. I'd rather drive the extra half hour to go to a different location."}
{"text":"Knock out every time I return! I've been to a few locations but this one is the most convenient.  The quality of the food especially the chicken is just amazing and not to mention the amazing featured margaritas every time I go.  I usually don't take left overs but I make an exception for here because it's sooo good :) the service is always great and everyone is really nice. The atmosphere is cool and relaxing for a great lunch or night out !"}
{"text":"Back in the burgh and in need of lunch, I decided to head over to Mad Mex for a quick burrito. After having been slightly disappointed in my last visit in November, due to service and somewhat very stale chips, I decided to roll the dice and this time came up with boxcars (or snake eyes...I forget, which is better???)  Atmosphere - Same a previous but cleaner this time...including the restrooms  Food - I ordered the lunch special, a burrito and a side salad for $7.50. I also opted for the chips and salsa too. The chips...this time...crunchy, the salsa...crazy thick, almost paste like. The side salad with lime cilantro dressing was very good and even decent as a chip dip. The chicken burrito came as ordered, sans cheese and sour cream and was very filling.   Service - Helpful, cheerful, prompt and several tea refills  Price - $7.50 Combo w/ another $2.50 for chips and salsa.  Overall - Are there better more authentic Mexican resturaunts in Charlotte...yes, in Chicago...most definiately, in Pittsburgh...this place will do. MadMex you redeemed yourself on this visit with a great service experience and fresh food. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I have always been skeptical of Mad Mex just because Mexican food isn't my go to choice when eating out. I was very surprised and pleased with my visit.  The restaurant has an out door option which would be nice with a group of friends but for dinner for two I liked eating in. There is never much of a wait because service has always been quick. I really like the guacamole with chips or their wings for an appetizer. My main course is usually the same which may seem boring but hey I know what I like!  I get the tofu tacos and even writing about them now I'm craving them! The tofu is cooked perfect with a glaze that reminds me of a general tsos sauce. The soft shell tacos are topped with fresh bean sprouts a green salsa and some avocado. All of these ingredients working together makes for the best taco I've ever had. The meal also comes with rice black beans pico and I get sour cream.  Go try my favorite tofu taco! I'm now a Mad Mex fan!"}
{"text":"We had one of the best Mexican meals ever. Going to look for this restaurant in other cities. Only complaint, wish the music was not so loud."}
{"text":"Chicken nachos.  Ecstatically satisfying and addicting.  Seriously, I am marrying them.  Half price pints at happy hour - yay I had Young's chocolate stout.  A decor so interesting it's not worthy of the \"suburban chain Tex Mex\" place moniker in which it is housed.  Cool!  Taken by a date.  Made a date to return!  500th review for me - this was a special evening so it's got the crown!"}
{"text":"I'm used to the Mad Mex in Columbus when I went to OSU so this one isn't quite as nice. It's always super crowded whenever I go and the service is very inconsistent. There are some really nice servers and some really awful managers who can't answer any question I have.   Food tastes pretty good and the wings are my fave. Drinks are kind of pricey though for a casual sit down."}
{"text":"Good Tex Mex restaurant but service is really slow and it is hard to get ahold of a waiter. They just keep disappointing by not bring refills to drinks and forgetting sides for meals. Had to ask to get our check because waiter had disappeared. Good food but horrible serve. Was to be contacted by management for the service but they failed to follow up as well. Very disappointing will not be going to this establishment again. It is sad they had good food but poor follow up all around. This the reason for the drop in review."}
{"text":"I don't mind fusion food - Vietnamese fajitas rock - but sometimes it just doesn't work.  I'm used to the Mexican-infused Italian restaurants of the Southwest, which has made its way to Pittsburgh through a few chains, and I avoid them like the plague.  The salsa-like stuff they call sauce just doesn't do it for me.  But Mad Mex is the first Italian-infused Mexican I've ever tried.  And it doesn't work either.  Add some olive oil to the 'salsa' that comes along with the chips, and you've got a jalapeno brushetta.  Without the oil, as they make it here, it's nothing more than a dry clump of tasteless diced tomatoes, made hot by jalapenos.  And the chips were stale.  Following Chili's lead, the chips and salsa are considered an appetizer, and must be ordered.    I thought I was pretty safe ordering chicken fajitas. The chicken was doused in pesto.  A very strong basil pesto.  Considering that basil is the prime flavor of most Italian food, and cilantro plays basil's role with Mexican food, and the two herbs have very distinctive and strong flavors, this just didn't work.  At all.  If they were going for an Italian-infused Mexican, they could have at least tried something that might have worked, like, say, a cilantro-based pesto.  And the flour tortillas were gooey and thick, like the kind you find at the grocery store, not the delicate, airy, crisp, light, thin fajitas worked between the hands of an old Mexican woman.  A little bit on the pita-side.  I didn't order desert.  Didn't even ask about it.  I was afraid there might be tres lechesmasu..."}
{"text":"I would give less stars if I could... the service was atrocious.  Waited over an hour for lunch... utterly inexcusable on a Tuesday.   If they can't handle promotions, they shouldn't have them (apparently they were overwhelmed by Gobblerito orders).  I don't understand how as no one was in here at 1125 when we were sat. We had to ask what was going on... no update for 50 minutes!!!  This made us late for a very important meeting.  Mad Mex... you have garnered my only negative review on yelp to date!!!"}
{"text":"Today I ordered the barbecue burrito. It was delicious and the service we received was above expected. Our waiter and the manager helped provide the best customer service I have ever experienced in any restaurant. The manager's attention to my mother-in-laws needs we phenomenal. The margaritas are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food!! Cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious! We waited maybe 10 minutes for everything to come out and it was sizzling hot and so good!!"}
{"text":"nice happy hour spot (4:30-6:30)half off wings and beer,that's what I order anyway,and friendly bartenders!"}
{"text":"Glad they added this spot to the concrete jungle that is Monroeville.  This mad mex is located in Miracle Mile shopping center, sandwiched between a bank and a TJ Maxx (I think?).  I'm happy to have this here because most other options in that area are national chains at least this is a local chain.  The food is similiar to their other locations.  What stands out the most about this location is that they have a lot of outdoor seating.  Some of it is under a covered area, so it's a little cooler than directly sitting in the sun with the other tables.  THe shaded portion also has an open bar area that is shared between the outside and inside.  This outdoor bar and seating is a rare treat in this sea of chain restaurants and gas stations.  The tortilla chips are pretty good we tried them with a black bean dipping sauce (my favorite), regular salsa (okay), and a cheese sauce (not good, runny iwth a weird flavor).  I order the burritto combo which came with a cup of tortilla soup (about average could have used some tomatoes on top and a bit more chips).  I'll try the black bean soup next time.  The burrito combo I tried came with a steak fajita burritto.  It was good, but huge.  Next time I think I'll tell them to lessen up on the rice and beans.  The small amount of steak that was included was cooked well and tasty.  I only ate about 1/3 of this thing because of my longstanding rule not to try to eat anything bigger than my head.  The service was friendly and prompt.  Overall a very good addition to the options here in monroeville.  My business associate ordered the same burrito, but told them to skip the beans and rice and double the protein.  I think this was a good choice.  He also asked for tortillas in addition to just tortilla chips.  This was also a good suggestion.  He's obviously been here before."}
{"text":"I couldn't help but think while eating at Mad Mex, how am I not going to give this place 1 star.  Its the margaritas and the guacamole.  I have always been a fan of their frozen margaritas (got started on them at the one in Oakland).  I do have to say that their menu is also very funny, but I am really in it for the food. I've eaten at mad mex a couple times, and I've always been underwhelmed.  I got the red velvet burrito (sans spicy spinach to save my tender tastebuds), and I had eaten half of the thing (which is about the size of a football partially deflated) and got 2 pieces of zucchini and 3 bites of very tough chicken.    Another one of the diners in my group got an enchilada, and you could not even see the cheese there was that little of it.  The rest of the diners enjoyed their dinner, and no one complained of anything being over-spicy.  We shared chips and dips, with the guac being my fav.   The service was good.  They managed to seat us fairly quickly, even though we were a relatively large party for their pretty small space.  The noise level was tolerable, and the food came out hot and at the same time.   The bottom line for me: If you want good food, skip this place.  Try El Campesino down the road, heck, try Qdoba or Chipotle even.  If you want a good Margarita, then you've found your place"}
{"text":"Big ol' important EDIT: Frankly, there isn't a lot of true \"Mexican\" food in Pittsburgh and everyone from newspaper critics to newcomers complains. I've heard so many people say \"Mad Mex is the worst Mexican...\" Guess what. It isn't really Mexican. And a restaurant that blatantly uses Spanglish (Booze y Brews) in its menu KNOWS  it.  That being said, enjoy the food as you would the menu: American fare with Mexican influence."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is sort of the a Pittsburgh staple for mexican food. There are many of them around the city so I'm sure many yenzers have wondered into one at least once or twice. I have had many opinions of Med Mex over my different trips but I think I have landed on that I like the restaurant over all.   The food is often really good and their margaritas are delicious frozen or on the rocks. The decor is pretty unique and gives the restaurant a cool vibe and makes for a good experience. This location has a cool outside patio that has heaters for the winter and feels great during the summer.  Over all do I think this is the best mexican food in pittsburgh? No. Is  it a good restaurant with good food that will deliver a good consistant experience? Yes."}
