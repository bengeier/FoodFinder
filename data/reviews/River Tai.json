{"text":"Just had a very quick light dinner at River Tai.
Old school (home style Cantonese and not fancy resto.. 1960's decor). Sure nice elder owners. Very inexpensive. We tried : Cantonese chow mien and veggies and tofu on rice. Both were yummy. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe this place . I don't eat Chinese food a lot because I am not so sure about the quality , this is the cheapest food I found in Toronto and the entire time I was eating I said , oh my god . Give it a go and you won't regret ."}
{"text":"River Tai is a hidden gem.

It's a hole-in-the-wall classic Cantonese restaurant. I know some people have been put off by the $3.99 special because it is so cheap that they question the quality of the food but you don't get a huge portion (perfect for lunch). The appearance of the restaurant is clearly not super enticing but I always do take-out and the food is great (the owners are also super nice)! Try it out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"3.5 This place is only for people who don't care for ambiance but are in the mood for good, cheap Chinese food. I had a General Tao combo for $7.50 with about half to take home.  This place is owned by an adorable Cantonese -Canadian couple who are doing their cooking well...their resto upkeep...not so much"}
{"text":"Old school Cantonese Chinese food at crazy low prices.

The \"Day\" specials are just $3.99, and while the potions aren't huge, they are more than fair for the super low price.

Ordered sweet and sour pork and it was really good and the extra sauce went great with the egg roll.  The egg rolls here are just wrapper with a bean sprout mix but that is my old school favourite.

I ordered by phone for pickup and it took a bit longer than they said but there seems to be just 1 chef/owner in the kitchen and he answers the phone too, and weirdly on a Tuesday at 4, there were 4 of us who all showed up at the same time.  But if a U of T student wanted a cheaper option to the food trucks just order 20 minutes before making the short walk just west of Spadina on Harbord.  I don't think any of those food trucks on St George could give you a $3.99 lunch!


3 stars for the food and an extra star for the super lunch deals!"}
{"text":"Decent food, low prices AND its close to campus. The couple working there was extremely kind and friendly, which is part of the reason I go eat there when I have the time. Oh, and their glasses were very clean. That seemed to please my girlfriend a lot, if that kind of stuff affects you as well."}
