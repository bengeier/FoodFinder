{"text":"Yay, first to review! :) Been wanting to try it out and glad we did tonight! Pretty solid and at reasonable prices for large portions. Had the ginger chicken (perfectly crisp with delicious sauce - my favourite dish), house noodles, stir fried prawns in satay sauce and fried rice. They have a huge menu so I had trouble selecting what to get lol. Nice mom and pop shop, the owners were very friendly. Located in a small strip mall with limited parking. Best to call them to get 10% off when picking up orders more than $35. Will be back!"}

{"text":"I ordered specifically to try the salt and pepper tofu and wasn't disappointed. It is super delicious. I also got two mixed veggie dishes and they were both great too. Will definitely order again. The person who took my order had no issue with my request for vegan dishes"}
