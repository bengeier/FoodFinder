{"text":"Today was our first visit here. We wish we'd been here sooner!  Very good Chicago style deep dish pizza. Pizza here makes you realize how inferior other pizza shop pizzas are!  We'll be regulars here for sure!  Good job!!!"}
{"text":"If you live in Kent and haven't tried NY2C's you're an asshole. Head and shoulders above all other pizza joints in Kent. Owner takes serious pride in his craft and it shows. I ordered a calzone and a slice of NY style (which is really like 1/3 of a pizza!) The calzone had an excellent blend of cheese, it wasn't very greasy at all even with pepperoni and sausage inside, all fresh ingredients (sausage was awesome!). I ordered the NY slice just to try it out and good god was it worth it! foldable bubbly crust, delicious sauce and a perfect blend of cheeses. I can die happy now."}
{"text":"This place is a breath of fresh air in a watered down pizza market in the kent area.  Their Chicago style pizza was delicious.  It took a while to cook but the food was worth the wait and the service was pretty good.  Def worth trying out"}
{"text":"This pizza is great. We got a calzone and our parents for a slice of pizza. This calzone was this size of half of a whole pizza, and the slice was a quarter of the size of a whole! They were both fantastic. We also got the Greek salad which was better than I expected. The only thing I would not recommend is the wings, but you shouldn't come to a pizzeria for wings anyway right? Overall, they had a wonderful friendly atmosphere themed around New York and Chicago, and a group room like a theatre. Would completely and most definitely come back, and actually have several times already. I will add some pictures in my next visit."}
{"text":"I dont know where to begin. I can not find the words to describe the pizza I just had here 20 minutes ago. I got the Chicago Deep Dish and wow. Literally if you're thinking of pizza in the Kent area think NY2C. Friendly staff, quick service and has definitely been added to ny must return list."}
{"text":"Ate business lunch with my associate here in November. Wings were soggy and greasy. Pizza was edible, though I won't frequent here, since wait time for the food was excessive. Staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Pizza was great and it was a fun place to eat!  We ordered the chicago style and it was delicious!  It was filling without being too heavy.  And the sauce had just the right amount of sweetness!  The staff was friendly too.
Will surely go back!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was great. The deep dish pizza is really good, even though I don't normally like deep dish. It had a great crust, all the ingredients were melted perfectly, not too crispy, not too soggy. I ordered a single slice of NY style, which they make to order, and that was also wonderful: a thin crust that stood up by itself. The second time, I got a whole NY style thin crust, and it was pretty good, but not as good as before. It had very sparse cheese and sauce, but the crust was still cooked well. The third time I ordered the same pizza, it was cooked differently, with more sauce and cheese, the toppings on the bottom, and the pizza slice went totally limp when I picked it up, and was hard to eat because of that. The owner, or at least the man I presumed to be the owner wasn't there that day. I feel like it really depends on who is working whether or not you get a consistent product. I'd still recommend trying it though"}
{"text":"Tried the NY style, pretty good pizza. Add Extra toppings & it starts getting a little exspensive(not worth the extra $$$).
I'll try the Chicago style next time."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Kent. Multiple pizza styles, fresh ingredients, and a fantastic owner who will go out of his way to make sure you're satisfied."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered separate pizzas.  Hers was just OK.  Mine was awful.  I ordered a pizza with 4 veggies on it, nothing special.  It came out soggy, when I asked they fix it, they brought it out 10 minutes later, still soggy.

The manager/(owner?) came out and basically said it was my fault, and that they knew it would come out soggy.  I recommended they grill the veggies before to reduce the water content, or share their knowledge at minimum to recommend a change.  

Then the manager goes on to tell me when he makes his own pizza he grills them first.

I guess customers aren't as important."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday close to 7.  The dining room was mostly empty.  The service was great and the food came out promptly.  We ordered a salad to split and a new York cheese pizza.  I have eaten pizza in new York and this is a decent option.  I wasn't overly impressed, but it wasnt bad.  The decor is nice and the place was clean.  We would like to go back and try the Chicago pizza.

We also got a piece of cheesecake to go which was satisfying, but not stellar.  The taxi cab cookie was superb!  

We will go back to try other things, but we wont go out of our way to go back for the new york pizza."}
{"text":"I was in town for a couple of hours and I stumbled into this place completely out of convenience. I ordered a slice and I expected some run-of-the-mill wedge. The owner, I believe, explained that it might take a few minutes since he makes them fresh. What?

I dutifully waited with my stomach growling (it really wasn't that long). Man, this pizza is good. My only complaint is that it was too hot, and that's not really a complaint. I just let it sit there a couple of minutes. This guy seems to take pride in his pizza and it shows. After talking he encouraged me to come back. And if I lived anywhere near this place, I would. I told him I would leave good reviews and let everyone know how excellent his product was. 

I didn't have the Chicago style, but if it's even close to his NY style, this man is a culinary genius. 

So, Mr. Pizza Guy. I've told everyone how I felt about your pizza. I hope this helps make up for me not being able to be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Authentic deep dish Chicago pizza with the sauce on too! And the NY style pizza folds just right. If you crave pizza, skip the chains and stop at NY2C. Great little family-run place with excellent food, great service too. A definite must-try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in and got a calzone. We both love calzones so when the menu said it feeds 4 we thought we could eat it with no problems. We ended up eating only half of it between us because it's huge! The crust was amazing and the sauce was top notch.  The cheese was super gooey and I'm a huge fan of ricotta in calzones so I was very happy about that (I do wish there was a bit more but that's an uncommon preference). 
I'll be coming back to get the pizza, those looked great too."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite pizza place. Every time we go I end up having great conversations with the owner. The place is great"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good. Chicago style dough is flaky and buttery and the sauce has a good balance of spice and sweetness"}
{"text":"My husband and I seriously come here about once a week for this pizza. I love pizza, and this is my #1 place to go. We love both the Sicilian and the Chicago pizzas. The ingredients are fresh and tasty! The crust on both pizzas is cooked perfectly every time. I can't speak to the veggie pizzas, because we get pepperoni, or sausage, or just cheese. We take friends and family here often, and they always say this is one of the best pizzas they've ever had. Try this place out and support local businesses! I really don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza, our family goes there a lot. The service needs improvement, they are routinely slow and too frequently mess up the order. Thankfully the pizza is good and the staff is pretty friendly."}
{"text":"The NY pizza was awesome! Felt well taken care of. Cozy and fun place."}
{"text":"Best, freshest pizza in all of Ohio. Skip the grease-fest from Luigi's or generic crap from the chains and get a quality slice from here."}
{"text":"Just what Kent needed!!!! Don't let the fact that they don't deliver stop you. Just pick it up and be delighted!"}
{"text":"Have been hearing rave reviews for NY2C Pizza in Kent for weeks and finally had to try it for myself.
 
I called ahead to see what time they closed, and was asked what time I wanted to come in...Was immediately taken back because you'd be hard press to find a business that literally asks YOU when you'd like to come in! [FIRST POINT EARNED] I said around 9pm-ish, which was fine.

The inside atmosphere is a perfect combination of New York and Chicago with an open kitchen where you can see the pizza's coming out of the oven. Love the Ma&Pa feel from employees.The staff is genuine, straight out of a Godfather movie and delighted to have your business.
Unfamiliar with their menu, only that they did different style of pizza. I ordered one New York and one Chicago (our household has a split pizza preference). This is a no nonsense place. Simple menu; Pick a pizza style, add some toppings and you've got OUTSTANDING pizza

This Pizza is STUPID GOOD...AMAZING. Sauce taste like it's stewed on a stove for hours. It has a perfect amount of acidity and spice that is sure to give me heartburn, (all tomato based things do) but frankly I do not care because every bite is worth it. Crust in baked to golden brown perfection on both styles. All around amazing texture and taste on this Pizza!
New York style is my favorite, and their pizza was legit. Thin crust you can fold, perfect sauce cheese ratio along with the right amount of topping, then finished with a blend of seasonings that ties everything together. Now I'm not partial to Chicago, that's the fiances favorite, but even I can appreciate how good NY2C's Chicago style was. Deep (not thick) crust filled with sauce, toppings, Parmesan cheese and those seasonings...

Being one of the last customers that evening and the pizza's being as good as there were says something for this establishment. I see others have had issues with wait time, but that's to be expected with any pizza shop that you're getting authentic made to order from scratch food. It's either taste or time and I'd wait for the taste of this pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the live classical musicians (dined in on Friday night) were a nice touch.

Tried the NYC style thin pizza by the slice (which is basically a quarter of a pizza) and the Sicilian pie.  Have to say the Sicilian was not thick enough crust to qualify as true Sicilian in my book.  NYC style pizza was better but just OK.  If you've truly had pizza in NYC, you'll know what I mean. Their sauce is kind of bland.  Not enough garlic.

Won't make me forget about Luigi's or Coccia House but we'll go back to try their Chicago deep-dish."}
{"text":"Horrible.  The pizza had absolutely no resemblance to a New York style pizza and I'm a born and raised New Yorker.  The crust was more like a crisp flat bread, and was pretty tasteless; none of the chew a real NY pizza would have.  Everything else about it was mediocre at best.  And the Greek salad was pretty tasteless too.

And they don't have a liquor license. 

I'll never be back."}
{"text":"I was truly impressed.  We tried both the NY and the Chicago style pizzas.  Both were cooked to perfection.

The crust was crisp but not burnt, the sauce was perfect and there was plenty of cheese (we did not order x cheese).

David and I will definately come back to this out of the way pizza joint in Kent."}
{"text":"This place really is fantastic!

The thin crust \"NY Style\" is crisp all the way through the crust. Most places seem to not be able to do this and end up with a soggy middle.

The buffalo chicken (with blue cheese) is a great option as well!

I just wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Drove by tonight and noticed they were gone. Good riddance to bad businesses!

Bought exactly one pizza from this place. One too many.

16\" New York style with pepperoni, artichokes, jalapenos, and green olives. Was charged $17.75. Pizza was way underdone.  The ENTIRE pizza had five slices of pepperoni, two artichoke hearts, six jalapeno slices, and three green olives. Was an absolute ripoff.

I hear they're moving to a new location. Maybe they would have been busier & not needed to move if they hadn't jacked their prices so high and gave nothing in return. I won't be back."}
{"text":"5/30/2011 - My family tried the Chicago style and the Sicilian. Both were terrific and the staff was great. It wasn't Gino's East, but darn good.

7/2/2011 - Update. The family and I dined in. The staff was friendly, but I will agree that the kitchen service was slow. I believe it's because they serve fresh food. The pizza (NYC style) and calzones were really good and worth the wait, but don't dine in if you are in a hurry."}
