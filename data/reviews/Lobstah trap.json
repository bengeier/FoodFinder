{"text":"Not bad but could have been better. Got the lobster roll and didn't have a lot of flavor for 17 bucks."}
{"text":"Very small location on the strip located across New York New York hotel, and the area looks abandoned almost during the day. I walked into this restaurant bc i needed something quick before my show and I didn't expect much but I was beyond blown away by the delicious quality of food they provided me with. The Connecticut roll was absolutely divine and the Lobster Quesadilla was delicious and super cheesy and huge! I wish i could have gone back to try their salads, those looked amazing too! Definitely will come back when I go on vacation again!! The cashier was also very nice and outgoing and willing to help me decide and was able to make suggestions, thats always a plus!"}
{"text":"I just recently visited the Lobstah Trap in Las Vegas on the strip right across from City Center Aria it used to be the old Hawaiian Marketplace right next to Pete Rose Sports Bar and Grill which by the way I visited also in  the past and it is an awesome place to hang out good food great friendly staff and management is so great with their employees and they have an  excellent choice on draft beers as well as bottled beers if you like sports I highly recommend PeteRose to watch sports,  I ate at the Lobstah Trap Lobster Quesadilla and had the Original Maine Lobster Roll both were excellent I highly recommend this place employees were so friendly definitely a place I would recommend to all my friends great place to come with friends. Will definitely come back and visit."}
{"text":"Stopped there hungry for normal food that doesn't cost an arm or a leg.  The lobster bisque was a nice broth and very flavorful. The lobster salad was light and refreshing.  We enjoyed it so much that we ordered Lobster Salad, more bisque and some clam chowder for dinner too.  Reheated just fine- oh and the cashier was very nice! 
If we lived here we would visit regularly"}
