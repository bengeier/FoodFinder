{"text":"Nice people Very good cheap food recommend 100% pizza is good wings are banging give it a shot you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service. In today's time you should not want to lose not one customer every penny counts and it adds up as revenue for the year. We used to always order pizza from this place until one day we ordered and the pizza was not to our liking. The pizza was dry and appeared as if it was overcooked we called to explain our concern and the owner went back and forth with me indicating that he saw the pizza when it went out and that it was to his liking when it went out. Now keep in mind that I am the customer and I had never had a problem before as far as returning a pizza or receiving a pizza that was not to my liking. Nevertheless the owner did not want to make it right he insisted that the pizza was okay he was not concerned about my complaint and he refused to make another Pizza and send it to us. Since that day I have not patronize that place at all Papa John's delivers in this area now and I will never ever go back there. I think the only reason he may continue to get business in this area is because the pizza is so cheap."}
{"text":"Good Cheap pizza! People are always very nice! Pep and chez is the fav!  It's not in a supper great area. But it's not the worst either. I think they would do great down town. Not a place to sit and eat eather. Just order and take home and don't forget to rent a movie at red box!"}
{"text":"We frequently have the medium pizza with sausage, pepperoni, peppers, mushrooms and onion for $8. It is very good."}
{"text":"I like Tony's Pizza its very good. The owners are very nice and wants to please the customer. The prices here are very fair and reasonable. When you walk in you notice  the place is very clean and the owners take pride in keeping their restaurant running efficiently. I've had better pizza but if your in a rush and want some decent food this is a pretty good pizza. I tend to stop here on lunch break time from time. Eat Tony's enjoy."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. It's comparable to Little Ceasars and Georgios.  The pizza had little sauce and cheese. The toppings were scarce and the pepperoni lacked a crispness.  I requested a well done pizza and it was doughy.  I won't be returning. Doesn't taste that great.  Ceasars and Georgios is better."}
{"text":"Quick easy simple. I had the $5.99 special which was a pepperoni & Cheese pizza, the pizza was hot and fresh and cooked perfectly. It's nice to have a family owned establishment instead of the ordinary chains."}
{"text":"I love this place I live right down the street so I come here all the time the pizza is always fresh, the employees are always nice and pleasant they have some really great other menu items as well. Not to mention they're extremely affordable when you're in college and on a budget!"}
{"text":"GREAT food for amazing prices! Pepperoni & cheese calzone w a can of Pepsi (one of several $5 lunch specials) and garlic breadsticks w sauce for $2.50!!! Not frozen dough either!!   Cannot wait to come back soon!!"}
{"text":"Here is a review from a fat guy's perspective. If you know pizza, you know finding a brick oven pizza is hard to do in this city. Tony's pizza has that brick oven taste that reminds you of New Jersey pizza. You would never consider buying just a cheese pizza pie from dominos or pizza hut, but I find myself often times going for just the cheese pizza at Tony's. It reminds me of the old sabaro's style pizza but not as sweet on the sauce. A Large cheese pizza is $8.50 delivered with NO delivery fee. The sausage pizza was great as well. If you are not in the mood to cook, and want a step up from the basic pizza places, call Tony's."}
