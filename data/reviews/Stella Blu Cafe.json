{"text":"This place is quality! The cafe just opened and my fiance and I decided to try their specials since I have also been to their cooking class (Flambe Gourmet). The food is amazing. The ambience is warm and you can tell the staff cares about their craft. Very friendly and willing to chat with you instead of just rushing you through.

I have gone to places like Starbucks and local places near me and normally you get sugar with a hint of coffee and a gourmet sandwich which is essentially a bagel with melted cheese. 

The food here is delicious with good size portions that leave you feeling light and ready for the day instead of my usual need of a nap. Don't be deceived by it just opening; the menu is full and all looks good. I am excited to go back."}
{"text":"This a gem located on Madison's north side. The French toast was outstanding, focaccia bread amazing. The sweets are great and home made. Service and seating is great. Highly recommended!  It's a great location very near Tenny Park and the locks."}
{"text":"I will be the first one to admit getting a 5-star rating out of me is tough but Stella's did it.  They are a new business and their menu is small.  In my opinion, that was a great choice.  Do it small and do it well.  

I ordered one of their signature sandwiches, the Italian sausage.  No, this was not served in a traditional manner, but wow was it amazing! It has been quite a long time since I have said \"yum\" about my food.

I started this reviewing a couple of months ago and now I learned they only have weekend hours.  Why?  I loved going here for lunch in the otherwise food dessert of north Madison.  And now?  Nothing.  With so many brunch options, I would not put Stella Blue at the top of my list.  Please open up for weekday lunch again."}
{"text":"So happy I decided to try this place out, I'm a fan! Inventive sandwiches are a nice change up from the typical tuna salad, granola, turkey wraps, et al found at other coffee joints. Had the buffalo mozzarella sandwich that came with fig jam. Portions were reasonable and person at the counter was splendid. Will definitely be by again!"}
