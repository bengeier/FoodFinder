{"text":"Authentic food and very good. I recommend the steak dish, and the salsa was good too. Hopefully Stoughton can support two Mexican restaurants!"}
{"text":"I appreciated the selection of meats they offer - some real authentic stuff like lengua, tripa and cabaza.  I had the two taco lunch, the food was A-OK.  I will admit, it's a bit expensive, I'd appreciate a bit more value."}
{"text":"I'm updating this review because I've given Paco's another chance and despite the prices, the food is really good. The three taco dinner is great! The cilantro and avocado is tasty with chicken, beef and goat. I was a little hesitant when I ordered the goat, but it was really good.   I asked my family why they now prefer Paco's to other Mexican restaurants in town and they immediately said the food seems less greasy. I'm not sure I agree. I'd say it's more a matter of overall flavor. Plus, the Main Street location is great for people watching.   We gave Paco's another chance and we're glad we did."}
{"text":"Taste great. Had dinner. Salsa is green and has unique flavor. The steak fajita was very good. I will be back."}
{"text":"Very good food! So glad stoughton finally has real mexican food, green salsa was awesome and tacos had avacado on them, bonus! I found another restaurant I will frequent, so happy"}
{"text":"Yum. The tamales are the real deal and the menudo is delicious, full of flavor. Get in there and let's keep an authentic place open, Stoughton!"}
{"text":"There's a few things I need to cover first before explaining why I rated so low:  The customer service was great.  The atmosphere was cute. The food was pretty good too (I LOVED the green salsa).  Granted, the chicken burrito I had was relatively dry, however my husband did enjoy his tamales. And I do have to admit that the Horchata had a overwhelmingly cinnamon taste.   However, what makes me give them three stars is the prices.   They're appalling. This is the single time that I have ever and will ever pay $11 for a burrito. They are charging ridiculous prices for food that you can get for cheaper and tastes better if you just drive 10 min to Oregon, McFarland, or even 20 min to Madison. They are set up as a quick service meal and expect people to pay table service prices. Not even El Rio Grande charge as much as they do. I know this isn't Chicago but that's where I grew up and down there I don't even pay this much.  For my husband and I to eat JUST a burrito, their 2 tamale dinner, and one glass of horchata we paid $30 (including a  15% tip). There is no way that a meal, that doesn't even come with free chips and salsa (they charge $5.99 for them by the way and I don't count the table spoon serving of salsa they gave me with the burrito), should cost that much.  The only way I can see this restaurant making it is if they lower their prices. Unless that happens we will personally not be going back. Not saying you shouldn't give them a chance, but just be warned that you will be stuck paying more than necessary."}
{"text":"Nice small, locally owned place. The owner was there working and waiting on people and definitely wanted everyone to be satisfied. It was a one man show as it wasn't too busy for lunch the day I stopped in.    I ordered the two tamale dinner which included beans rice couple of sides of hot sauces and two very very large tamales that were absolutely homemade and delicious  -- some of the best tamales I have ever eaten!  Pepsi products on fountain as well as cans to go and Mexican beverages are available as well.  They do run a small buffet weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Lunch Buffett was great!  Corn or flour tortillas and all the fixings you need. We were driving through in the way to Northern Wisconsin, this place is really quaint!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Pacos Tacos since we moved to Stoughton in May.  Such authentic, tasty Mexican food is hard to find.  Their green salsa is addicting!  Very good food, friendly people and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. I was a bit apprehensive considering some of the reviews but I had great luck and my opinion on the lunch prices are quite fair. $10 for a Chimichanga+Sides+Drink is VERY reasonable compared to Madison area prices.   Chimichanga (Avocado+Veggies) - 4.5/5 - I'd say the best part of the meal. I highly recommend the diablo or other hot sauces available to give your meal a bold kick but I prefer spicy food when it comes to Mexican. There was some hard pieces in the chimichanga (one of the vegetables used - not sure which) that seemed out of place. This is comparable to El Pastor's(Park Street) Avocado Chimichanga which is a great option for Stoughton.  Rice 2/5 - Probably one of the lesser favorites of the meal. The flavor seemed like a boxed spanish rice which is not really great. I prefer the one at El Rio Grande.  Beans 3/5 - A decent side but again, not the best I've had. Somewhere in the middle.  Service 5/5 - Friendly and quick service. Although I didn't get chips with the meal(I know there was complaints about that), the food came so fast I doubt I would have gotten any chips in. To be fair, I was the only one there not doing the buffet but I've been to enough places to know that isn't always a guarantee for speed.   Prices 5/5 - Again, to me, these seem very fair for Madison area prices.   Hopefully the place grows as Stoughton always needs more restaurant variety and because it is more of an authentic mexican style(el pastor/taqueria guadalajara/los gemelos/etc.) - it is a great alternative to El Rio Grande's more mainstream style(Senor Peppers,  Lalo's Mexican Restaurant). Both existing in Stoughton is a great thing as both styles and flavors are great for certain crowds and days of the week."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We ordered chicken enchiladas, fajitas, a chicken quesadilla and a pork taco for take out. When we were sorting our order at home, we thought they forgot my enchiladas- we found them under a pile of iceberg lettuce and onions. There was next to no sauce. The \"enchiladas\" were basically a pile of broken tortilla, chicken, lettuce and onion all mushed together- like really mushy nachos. The fajitas were 90% onions and peppers, and the steak was cheap- like Subway's steak. The quesadilla was fine. The taco had some kind of very dry, reddish mystery meat (so I didn't eat it) but the cilantro and avocado made for nice toppings. $37 seemed excessive for what we ordered, but if it was good we would be ok with it. We will not be back. We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Park in back- food excellent- service excellent... loved the steak Gorditas, Carnitas. Lots of people doing take out!! I highly Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Driving to Northern Wisconsin was looking for a lunch spot other than the chain restaurants.  Came upon Pacos Tacos from other Yelp reviews and glad we stopped.  Great lunch buffet with tacos and all the sides.  Friendly service and good food.  Recommend a stop for anyone wanting good Mexican!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on their first Saturday open and ordered two 3 Tacos dinners - one with Cecina (which is marinated beef) and one al Pastor (which is marinated pork). You order at the counter and then the food is brought to your table. Both dinners came with tasty salads (not iceberg lettuce!) followed by the platters themselves. The tacos each consisted of two soft corn tortillas filled with the meat plus cilantro, chopped onions, and a slab of avocado. There were accompanying sauces that added some extra flavor but were not particularly hot. Hotter sauces are available. There was a nice quantity of rice and house-made refried beans on the side that did not overwhem the platters. We made a dinner and next day lunch out of our meals. The flavors were fresh and authentic, the prices reasonable, and the service friendly. We will be returning to try the tortas, cemitas, and tamales."}
{"text":"Better burrito than the other Mexican restaurant. Ingredients seem fresher. Worth the extra money for better quality.   Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Very slow service....poor food and poor food quality My husband and I very much like Hispanic/Mexican food. We have sampled many tacos and tamales and this tops the list as awful. The tamales did not have any meat inside. The refried beans are advertised as homemade, but tasted like microwaved.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a street taco restaurant in the heart of downtown Stoughton.  If your a fan of food network or watch Rick Bayless shows, you will know these tacos are the real deal!  He actually serves goat tacos everyday, and my husband is a huge fan! He also has all the other standard proteins for those not quite as adventuresome.  This is not your standard American Style Mexican fare, so other than the queso dip there is nothing drowning in cheese. Which actually I prefer. The guacamole is handmade fresh and delicious!  Just give it a try and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!!"}
{"text":"Paco's Tacos had delicious food! I got the tamale dinner, which came with beans and rice on the side. I was craving good refined beans and these were some of the best I've had in a while! My husband got the 3-taco dinner and he was impressed by the flavors as well as the fact that they were all topped with fresh avocado and cilantro. I wasn't a fan of the salsa, but that was purely based on personal preference. My two year old daughter shared both of our meals and loved it all, especially the rice and beans.  The atmosphere wasn't anything to write home about, but I am so excited to have such delicious food within walking distance. People have complained about the expensive prices, but I would much rather pay a few dollars more for REAL food that is delicious than go cheap and eat just-OK food."}
{"text":"We had the tamale dinner, ranchero steak, and seasoned steak tacos. Everything was great! The tamales were very tender, the rice and beans were excellent which a lot of Mexican places treat as an after thought I feel. Really great stuff. Would definitely go back if I lived here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and am already planning another visit! Everything is delicious and fresh! Staff is super friendly and helpful!"}
