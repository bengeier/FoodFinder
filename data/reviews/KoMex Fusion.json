{"text":"AMAZING!!!

 I was referred here by a friend and at first thought \"Korean and Mexican?? WEIRD... i dont know\"... but my husband and I were in the area and thought why not, lets try it... after my friend had nothing but great things to say about this place. We tried the chimichanga and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.... We actually did 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef (have you EVER been to a place that will make a burrito half and half? i havent!) The meat has fantastic flavor. I'm not a beef girl but i'd order a whole plate of their beef - its that good. The chimichanga was HUGE enough for both of us to share it (and my husband also had a beef taco which also was delicious) and we were FULL and it was $11 total with drinks. YOu cant beat that.

THe service was great. The server was so nice and attentive- you could tell she was the owner. 

The only thing I'd change is their chips they serve. They were burnt, too thick and kind of bland but their salsa is great. And lets face it, i'm fat so I we ate two baskets anyway so they cant be that bad. lol

All in all, food was delicious, A LOT of food for cheap, great prices, great service great flavor. Hell even my burps taste delicious. Bahaha!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the bulgogi nachos.  The chips are always crisp,  toppings are plentiful and portion size will fill you up. The fusion beef sliders with fries are great. Who knew a bulgogi cheesesteak would be so delicious, they did that's why it's on the menu. I love getting the pork belly skewers as an appetizer. I always leave full and satisfied with some leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"Had the Chimi, Tacos and Bugogi fries.  Had no ides what to expect of the fusion taste.   Simply put, I was blown away.  Definitely on our return to list of places!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, clean place, friendly people. If you want good food and more than ample servings, Komex is the place."}
{"text":"All the food here is excellent, but be sure to order off the fusion menu to experience a unique blending of flavor crystals.

The lettuce wrapped fish tacos with kimchi are excellent paleo fare.

Excellent prices, quality service. Tip heavy my friends."}
{"text":"Decided to try this hidden gem last week and have to say so glad we did.  Place is pretty much in the corner and parking is not too easy as it is limited due to other businesses but again worth the maneuver!  Lots of choices so it was a bit of a hard decision - ended up going with the Korean beef half & half nachos (1/2 fries 1/2 chips) - meat was absolutely to die for!!  Make sure you try the pork belly taco and if you have enough room order a chicken taco as well. Only downside is no alcohol but definitely not a deal breaker.  Will try again soon!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. One of those small businesses that's hard to find, but it's worth it.

I order the fusion burrito and fusion bulgogi nachos/fries. Flavor in every bite. The meat was cooked really good (I ordered the chicken and beef already), it was hard to chew or to chewy. The nachos/fries were so delicious.

They give you a lot for what you pay. $6 or $7 for a big burrito and the half order of the nachos/fries was filling as well. 

If you think about trying this place, don't hesitate. It's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Been here about 4x now - close to my work.  I had heard they had fantastic tacos - and they DO.  Love the blend of Mexican/Korean fusion.  Flavors are awesome.  Go try it out - you won't be disappointed and you can walk out for less than $10.  I keep going back to tacos - had the burrito once.  Bulgogi tacos - so good.  Service for the limited staff - just excellent - they take care of you."}
{"text":"Sooooo so so good. I've never experienced Korean/Mexican fusion before so I don't have anything to compare it to, but this place nails it. A true hidden gem in the outskirts of Vegas. Very friendly guy, fair prices, and amazing taste. A must try!!! And try the fusion guacamole!! BY FAR the best meal I had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I live in So Cal and there are a lot of Korean/Mexican style food trucks. I really like the fusion blend and I think that the flavors go together well. KoMex has really found a way to not only mix the flavors, but I think that they do it better than the others. Their food is less greasy and they have a big menu. 

The tacos are really good. I can easily motor down 5-6 of them. The wanton chips are a nice touch and they go great with the fusion theme. Everyone in our group liked the fried rice. Just be aware of the huge portion and the smell of kimchee that will ooze from your pores. 

Overall this is good food at a great price. You can easily stuff your face and keep that hard earned money at the same time. I think that the food is 4 star quality but the owner was so nice and she will not oversell you on the food. If you order too much she will tell you. For those reasons alone they get a bonus star."}
{"text":"First of all, we got a check-in offer of free fried wontons!

Second of all, when I told the lady (she seemed like the owner) about how I've eaten at the Kogi truck in L.A., she already knew the difference between their food and her food and was able to tell me. She was honest saying some people like KoMex more and others still like Kogi more.

Third of all, our bill for 3 people was only $11.80. Granted, 2/3 of us didn't order very much... but still.

Ok so the food...

The chips w/ salsa & guacamole was very good. The chips were homemade and I think the salsa & guac are too. I have had better homemade salsa, but the guacamole was very good.

I had the (insert korean name here) pork taco and bulgogi beef taco.
I am not sure how to even describe it, but it was very good. Everything was made fresh. The meat was hot, tortillas were soft and the vegetables were crisp.
I would say that I liked the pork one more than the bulgogi one.

After the dinner rush had begun to slow down, the lady who seemed like the owner came to our table not only to check on us, but to talk to us. She was telling us how on weeknights the busy rushes are kind of unpredictable. She was apologizing for the wait since there was only 1 cook that (wednesday) night, but honestly, we didn't even wait that long. If we did, we didn't notice because we were so caught up in conversation.

This place is far from us and they said they would be opening another location closer to 215 & rainbow.

OH and this location has so much character! It is a true hole-in-the-wall. It's the kind of place that looks like you should question eating there, but when you do, it is so delicious! LOVE IT!

{"text":"Food is ok. 

Hole in the wall. 

Ghetto location

Feels like the kind of place you would see a roach or two. 

There is no service. 

Not quite sure how they got so many reviews."}
{"text":"American food.

They can make the kimchi fried rice less spicy, right?

I wasn't expecting actual tater tots in the bulgogi tater tot special."}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying, this place is awesome!  It was packed on a Saturday night when we arrived.  We had to wait a bit to be seated, but we didn't care after tasting what we had waited for.  My table and I went crazy for Bulgogi since this is what you should do when trying Korean/Mexican/Chinese/American fusion (phew!)  We ordered the Bulgogi fusion tacos, the Bulgogi fusion burrito, and the Bulgogi fries.  After seeing pictures of those fries and living in San Diego for years where carne asada fries are like crack, I couldn't resist.  Everything was delicious!  The tacos were cheap and had great flavor.  We ordered kimchi on the side which was a nice accompaniment.  The burrito used similar ingredients but could definitely fill you for days.  The fries came out on a huge plate and we could barely make a dent in them, although we did try our best.  The server was very attentive and friendly.  Plus, she didn't stare in disgust as we sat before this mountain of food, which was much appreciated.  I will definitely be back Komex, but next time I think I will venture onto the Asian side of the menu."}
{"text":"When I heard of komex is was like whats that... After I ate   some food from Komex I was like OMG this is the best... I highly recommend eating there..  service is outstanding just like the food... Who would have thought Korean food mexican food mixed tasting so great together.... well its awesome and so delicious that im addicted to eating there on a weekly basis...."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been here several times( I always forget to check-in, I am a rookie Yelper) and every time I am there I am NEVER disappointed. The Bulgogi is great. I love the chimichanga, and the tacos are excellent. If you are off the strip and looking for somwhere the locals go, THIS is the place!"}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall kind of place which j love. The food is better than any Vegas gourmet 5-star. 

The taco sampler and Bulgogi bowl are my favorites.
 
All in all, amazing food. Great service and very affordable."}
{"text":"Went to KoMex for the first time for my friends birthday...one word DELICIOUS. Once my friend mentioned the place I checked it on yelp and the ratings were 4 to 5 stars so I was pretty excited to check the place out and try the food. 

For starters we ordered the bulgogi fries and nachos both half orders. Beef bulgogi kimchi fried rice, combo fried rice, spam musubi that we all shared. The fries were worth trying, as for the nachos they were good as well. But if I had to pick between the two to try its would definitely be the fries. The kimchi fried rice was delicious, especially being a kimchi lover. The combo fried rice came with veggies, beef, and shrimp which was good. 

If you haven't been here you definitely have to try this spot out, worth spending some bucks on."}
{"text":"It was much better when it was just a \"family\" business. I understand when business starts picking up, you have to hire more servers and such but there are just some things you can't teach a person like customer service. Living in Vegas, and working in the hospitality industry, you basically live off tips, and you get more tips if the product you provide is great, and the customer service is even better.

Walked-in and got seated immediately with no greeting whatsoever. Waited about 5 minutes to actually get our menus and a few minutes after that for our waters. They were steady busy but nothing crazy like 2 servers couldn't handle about 10-15 guests. It seemed like this new lady server only dropped off the menus and water without giving us a notice that she would be with us, only if it was a convenience for her. She comes, takes our orders, and I tried to ask questions and it seemed like every time I had a question she would get mad because I was taking up her time or something. Seriously? Ordered a few tacos and that's it, 20 minutes later, she drops it off and leaves without asking if we needed anything else. I had to walk up to the counter and ask the lady at the counter for some condiments. Mehh



Not a fan of their new staff but their food is still good. It's not anything like KOGI from LA, but I give them credit for bringing something new into Vegas cuisine."}
{"text":"I love rice and ate some many different forms of it during my life time. Komex has one of the best rices i have ever tasted. Reasonable prices is a plus too.."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place being from LA where Korean Mexican fusion is not a new thing. The food was pretty underwhelming. They have some non-fusion tacos which were bland. The kimchi fried rice was not good. I make it all the time at home and the one at KoMex was too sweet. The portions are very large, so we took the leftovers home and doctored it up with some sriracha to tame the sweetness. 

It's a small place in a little strip mall. I don't think it's a place I'd go out of my way for."}
{"text":"What a great concept. Korean food and Mexican food made fresh. Had a great lunch today. Would recommend for anyone that wants to try something different good."}
{"text":"I am a picky eater and very very American when it comes to my food so a good review from me to KoMex you might find hard to believe but I did. 

Well here it is, KoMex is delicious, yummy, flavorful, big portions and great prices. I was introduced a few months ago and have been there alot since finding out about this place. They are a small business with only about 10 tables in the restaurant and the owner will normally be your server. She is the nicest lady and works really hard at her job and her business. 

This might sound strange but I always get the Mexican taco's (steak) and they are the best steak taco's I have ever had. KoMex makes them on those small corn shells and they are perfect. The taco's come in steak, chicken, pork, fish, and shrimp.  They start you off with freshly made tortilla chips and the guacamole is home made and my girlfriend loves it as she almost always eats it all up. 

I feel as if I should mention some of there other menu items that my girl gets all the time, chicken teriyaki=great, Mongolian beef= unbelievably good and the pork taco she claims is better than the steak but I doubt that. 

In the end, we get out of this place with a VERY full belly and still a fat wallet, well as fat as I had it to begin with the wallet that is. 

So here's the deal, if you haven't been here before GO and GO now cause it's just delicious and coming from a picky eater that tough to say.      

Your critic Vegas Villain"}
{"text":"Was introduced to this wonderful place soon after it moved to this location.  Great food!  Korean family style cooking (plates of great food brought to your table) Fusion Mexican entree's that combine great ingredients and flavors to provide spicy tasty Taco's, Burrito's and salsa's.  They have renovated the location, removing the space limiting booths and now boast more places to sit and eat this awesome food.
My only issue, they don't do a BiBimBap... Owner says, \"everybody does that.\"  I wish... :-) Because they are close and I know theirs would be great. :-)"}
{"text":"Their food is delicious!!  We have never had Korean/Mexican fusion before.  We are so happy we tried this place out.  We ordered bulgogi fries, bulgogi nachos, bulgogi sliders, and fusion burrito.  The portions are HUGE.  Next time, we will just share an entree.  The prices are very good for what you get.  The staff is super friendly.  We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Las Vegas. The sweetest owner, phenomenal food & wonderful prices! Only downside is that it's become so popular that they get Very busy & it's not a big restaurant. But it's worth the time and effort!!"}
{"text":"I checked out KoMex the other day.  I got the kim chi fried rice with chicken.  It was saucy and spicy and in a way...comforting.  It was nice to remove myself from the hustle from the Strip and sit down in a nice little hole in the wall restaurant.

I also tried the burrito.  It basically was any other burrito that I would have gotten at a mexican restaurant, but with bulgogi.  I kind of wish there was a sauce to go with it though.

The crew is really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get lunch when I don't feel like cooking. 
These ladies are very nice. And so are the cooks. Last time I went, I ordered to go, they comped me some free chips, salsa and guacamole!!! Which all were so delicious!!! 
If they had delivery service, they would have even more business!!!
And btw... Their portions are huge!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!

Big shout out to Sonny, Lynda, and Bryt! I've been spoiled  eating Sonny's food for the last 8 years but it just keeps on getting better and better!

Service is great, they are a truly nice family that owns the place, but the food is definitely out of this world. The nachos are a big hit but my favorite is the chimiganga with fusion beef. The flavors of the Korean beef mixed the the Mexican spices and mozzarella cheese are to die for. And the thing is HUGE..easily feeds any starving teen with a little left over for the next day.

You can't go wrong with anything you order. I've never had anything there that wasn't good. Also if you like Chinese food they have some killer Chinese dishes that you wouldn't expect from a Korean-Mexican restaurant.

Oh and if you like guacamole..don't think about ordering it..just do it! You won't regret it, you have my word. It's hands down the best guacamole I've ever had, and every single one of my friends agrees with me.

I do have one negative about this place though, and it's that they don't have a location in California! I promise you I would work there just to get paid in food!"}
{"text":"This was so good. Place is small and clean. The hostess greeted us. I had the tater totes, bugolgi cheese-steak,  and the tacos. The food is really good. A great mixture of korean and mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is absolute genius.  I wish I had this idea first.

Anything on the menu is delicious; however, the Korean nachos are my favorite."}
{"text":"Was okay, nothing special... fries were overly topped and soggy. Bulgogi had good flavor. Kim chi fried rice full portion was huge but not much flavor and greasy."}
{"text":"This place has got some baller tacos.  We came here after doing a Hoover Dam trip and on the way to Red Rock Canyon and it was the perfect stop.  If you want a break from some of the over-the-top nonsense of the Strip and something thats gonna be easier on the wallet but still freakin fantastic food, go here.  

I got three tacos: bulgogi, spicy pork, chicken.  Chicken is standard, bulgogi is amazing, and spicy pork had an awesome flavor to it.  

Fusion fries = just get it.  

If you want a great meal for a great price and a few hours away from the Strip to get yourself together, go here."}
{"text":"Linda @ KoMex Fusion was awesome. She was very friendly and helpful both times my wife and I have taken our Fusion to go. The food was excellent. On our first visit we had the fusion wings, bulgogi beef , the fettuccine and a fusion tostada. Our hats are off to KoMex. The wings were spicy but not too spicy, the beef was tasty and it was a hefty portion, the fettuccine was perfectly al-dente and the tostada was fusion of the two cultures(Mexican and Korean) at its best. Linda also politely cautioned us about purchasing the kimchi fried rice, as many westerners such as ourselves, may not enjoy it if they have not tried kimchi before, which was very kind given that it was our first time in the restaurant and she didn't know we love kimchi. Our second experience was just as good as our first, but this time we tried the fusion nachos, the pan fried fish, and the combination bulgogi with stir fried veggies. The fusion nachos were fantastic and there were a lot of them, the pan fried/grilled fish was done perfectly and the bulgogi was a home run just like the first time but with more meat and veggies. I will keep coming back to KoMex fusion because the food is great, the service is great, its conveniently located and the price is right. Great Job KoMex."}
{"text":"first time diner at KoMex the food  was awesome especially their  kimchi fried rice and  Korean tacos ...I will definitely come back for more...."}
{"text":"LOVE KOMEX!

I always order the bulgolgi fries and spam kimchee fried rice!  Their kimchee fried rice is the best Ive ever had!  The owners are super nice and take good care of their customers."}
{"text":"found this on my last visit and loved it! a bit off the strip, but i will make a point of going there every time im in vegas."}
{"text":"Love the food and customer service. Best fried rice I've ever had. I also ordered the wrong thing on the menu and didn't notice until I got my food. The owner gladly took it away and brought what I should have ordered. They could have been rude especially because it was during a busy time but they were nice and took care of it. Wish they had a location in the southwest."}
{"text":"Outstanding!

The food was excellent - we were looking for something different on a weeknight, and were pleasantly surprised.

Service was prompt and friendly.  The portions are generous, a good value for sure,

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome kimchi on my Mexican.  It's hard to find good Mexican out here but found a place that uses a lot Mexican food with awesome pickled and spicy Korean flavor.  Super affordable.  Bring your stretchy sweat pants..."}
{"text":"Not only is the food great but the service is amazing. Anytime I have a Mexican craving I know where I'm going. Side note: too anyone that is claustrophobic, the place is a bit tiny so you might wanna order too go."}
{"text":"I went here when I had family in town.  Great food and interesting fusion of Korean and Mexican food.  I thoroughly enjoyed the meal as did my family members.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service, great hospitality

I ordered the beef bulgogi burrito with kimche and it was great, and those two red sauces are amazing!

You can't beat the prices here, they really hook it up."}
{"text":"Great service, great food!  What a unique blend of flavors and artistic interpretation.  Best burrito I've ever had!  Fired Kimchi unbelievable!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The idea of this place to me is better than the actual place. I was really looking forward to some bulgogi and kim chi fried rice.  Both were pretty good, but really nothing too special. The lady working today was really nice"}
{"text":"What a great place..a little hard to find if your not familiar with area.  The waitress was happy to explain the menu and make recommendations. I wanted to do a little sampling.  I tried a spicy pork bulgogi taco which was fantastic. I had a side of fried kimchi followed by beef bulgogi and an order of mosupe (sp) (seaweed wrapped rice and spam).  the food came pretty fast and was great, but the taco was the best."}
{"text":"Great food and service! A small, simple place in an unassuming spot. Which is great for keeping prices low, but not for people driving across town and hoping to dine in. But, the food is so good, I'll eat it in my truck if I have to. Good size portions yet inexpensive enough were you can try multiple menu items in one visit. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  Everything is made fresh to order. Service is awesome, very friendly and courteous! Delicious fusion of Korean and Mexican food. Never tried something here I didn't like, nachos are my favorite thing to share!"}
{"text":"It looks a little weird on the outside, but take a risk and go here. You won't regret it. The food is so good and cheap."}
{"text":"I have been reading the review on this place for the past few months and always wanted to try their dishes.  Well I finally got a chance to go eat there  yesterday for lunch.
My wife and I tried their taco and the fried rice.  We both love this place.  I never thought Korean food and Mexican food will match like this.  This place is now one of my favorite easy dinning place in LV."}
{"text":"Amazing!! My husband ordered the bacon fried rice after hearing rave reviews about it. It was a giant bowl of amazing! 
I ordered the fusion beef enchilada plate. I was in heaven! I was expecting just plain ground beef, but the different cut they used was delicious! 
The size of the meals are perfect! We left with full and happy stomachs! 
Next visit I plan on trying the tater tot bowl (I can't remember the name) that was advertised on the front of the menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Had the bulgogi chicken & beef combo and the teriyaki chicken both were on point. The rice could have been better but not a deal breaker. Only 3 stars because the older Asian man that assisted my wife was rude. Everybody has their bad days, hope his gets better."}
{"text":"Food was EXCELLENT!!!!   Kim chee fried rice and the bulgogi fries were sooooooo yummy.   Service was very friendly as well.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The food was delicious. Not very expensive. Your full when your done. The staff was so friendly and kind. Never had to wait for anything. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fusion! Korean delicious beef & Mexican style. I highly recommend anything on the menu. The owners are so friendly and customer service oriented. Try it out your belly will thank you!"}
{"text":"Komex is about as good as it gets for casual quick eats. The shrimp and pork belly tacos and the spam kimchi fried rice is my usual order and its all awesome. The price is more than fair and the service always above average. Try it!"}
{"text":"A very nice Korean Mexican fusion dishes, that is nice if you want to get off the strip, and is very well priced. I fed 6 people for $85. That would never happen in the strip."}
{"text":"Korean Mexican fusion at it's finest.  Huge bulgogi burrito for under 5 bucks and great service to boot.  Gotta love the complimentary chips with salsa and guacamole"}
{"text":"Komex,  definitely doesn't disappoint food is always consistently good. The kim chi fried rice and bulgogi sliders are my favorites.  Best of all they serve beer!.."}
{"text":"One of the surprise visits during our trip to EDC. A must if you're into fusion foods : Korean/Mexican. Check out the Bulgogi Fries, fish taco's and Kim chi fried rice with Spam & egg on top!"}
{"text":"Great to see a true \"mom & pop\" establishment and not a Corporate America chain restaurant is now the top rated local restaurant in Las Vegas!

I love Chinese fried rice and KoMex's house fried rice is the tastiest I've ever eaten.  Also loved the the tacos and burritos made with marinated Korean beef!  Please note this is not fast food but it is GREAT food and each dish is made to order."}
{"text":"Yum! So flavorful and the price is right. Large servings and it comes out quick. Bulgogi tacos are a must your first trip, best combo fried rice I've ever had, even the wonton soup is delish. If you're lucky you'll be there on a day when they are serving \"Birria\"! It was the special on one of my lunch visits and the best dang fusion pot roast over rice you can imagine. Flavored were sweet and savory and the meat so tender it just melts into the rice."}
{"text":"I have now eaten here at least five times more and my five star rating still stands. I still havent dined in, which I would like to do eventually, especially since they remodeled and replaced the booths with tables, chairs, and benches. Oh, and they now have a new server to help the owner who speaks english, which helps things move along! My favorites continue to be the fusion tacos with kimchi. I also love their chicken fried rice, its become a staple now. I'm a big torta fan in general, so I finally tried their fusion torta... Yumm! But I definitely need to order that when I dine in, cuz the bread gets soggy by the time I get to eat it when I do takeout. So in conclusion, I have yet to be dissapointed, and hopefully will never be."}
{"text":"Went back again and can't get enough of this place. It just seems to get better. Tried the fired rice kimchi with bulgogi and a fried egg and was knocked out. Can't beat the food. Everyone in our party fought over the bulgogi nachos and homemade sauces. Tried a fusion flauta and it was delicious. Their passion ice tea is refreshing with no caffeine and free refills. The bulgogi sliders were huge, covered in their slaw. Gave it 5 stars the first time and Komex continues to impress."}
{"text":"I visited this place after hearing about it and seeing the yelp reviews. KOMEX definitely did not disappoint. I had the bugolgi tacos and combo fried rice.. AMAZE BALLS!!!! The location is a bit sketchy but the inside is better than the outside appearance. Will be back..."}
{"text":"I could not believe there was such a fusion out there. It's a very small restaurant but comfortable. The ladies there are very nice but when busy is hard for them to keep up with their customers. The good is amazing. I had the burrito... I will never forget how amazing it was. We also had some tacos and they made good for our son since they didn't have a kids menu. Great overall. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"I was a little uncertain about Mexican Korean fusion dining.  But I ordered the bulgogi burrito and it was delicious!  You have to ask for kimchi to be placed in the burrito because it does taste better that way.  The sauce was fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Tasty little joint safe to try for those who may of the less adventurous sort. Definitely ask for the house made salsa makes everything even more tasty. Bring your appetite and loosen that belt portions are generous. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is, but I really enjoy checking out fusion places. 

I've been to KoMex a few times now. This most recent visit I brought some first-timers with me & of course I had to order the bulgogi nachos to give them a taste of this place! My friends had a fish taco, fusion enchilada plate with chicken & a fusion burrito with bulgogi. Sadly, they mixed up the meats for the burrito & enchilada. One friend got a nice surprise, the other.. not so much. Yours truly decided to order the pork belly musubi & a (yes, singular) fusion flauta. I was a little disappointed with the pork belly musubi. Two pieces took up the whole plate. I could barely hold it, so I used my fork & picked at the pieces. My fusion flauta was pretty tasty though, so I was satisfied.  

I love the bulgogi nachos/fries! I'm glad that you can order half orders now. Definitely coming back when I have my next craving for them.  ..which might be soon.. :)"}
{"text":"Soooo good!  Had lunch for 2 for under $20 and it was more like a $40 meal. Very interesting flavored and excellent combinations. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing food I have had in a long time. The sauces are flavors I've never experienced before. All the veggies are super fresh and meat is seasoned to perfection. I had the burrito with bulgogi and the fried wontons. Just amazing. The chef is a genius. I can't wait to try all the other foods they have"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Las Vegas, great price. My favorite place in town!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent cheap eats. The bulgogi fusion flautas are an absolute must! Get there before noon during the week or you might have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"The fusion tacos were bomb and the service was awesome! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We unanimously decided to go back before heading back out on the road. We hit it big with this place. There was nothing on the menu that wasn't awesome. Who would've thought a Korean/Mexican fusion would be so awesome."}
{"text":"Discovered this place through Yelp and decided to check it out. liked the tacos and sliders were fantastic. We will be back for the nachos or bulgogi fries!"}
{"text":"KoMex was so so delicious I enjoyed my kimchee rice and the bulgogi burrito.  I will definitely recommend this place to any of my friends and family...so yummy!! Will come again for sure!"}
{"text":"We keep going back over and over. Very nice family own place that loves what they do.  Its not fast food, they do not make it till you order so it, so you might have to wait but its not a long wait like other reviews are. The Bulgogi nachos is the best thing and you have to try it at least once. Never had a bad meal there and my mouth is watering just thinking about the tasty food."}
{"text":"I've been to Komex a couple times now.  I first visited when they were brand new and gaining a following on Yelp.  While I was impressed with their pricing, I wasn't as impressed with their veg-friendly items we ordered.  There were no Korean-Mexican fusion eats for this girl.

It took a while for us to make it back, and the thing that changed was that they added tofu to their menu.  While I'm not a big tofu eater, I thought maybe this addition could help improve some of the times on their menu so I decided to finally stop back.  Guess what?  I can finally get fusion things here!  Hooray!

I'm a big, big fan of the tofu fusion tacos.  The tortillas are fresh, the marinated cabbage adds nice crunch and flavor, and it all comes with a selection of sauces to add!  The tacos are filled to the brim, so a fork and knife are pretty necessary here.

I've also had the Chow Fettuccine noodles.  They aren't bad, they aren't spectacular, but they are a decent noodle with tons of veggies for an awesome price.  It's definitely a cheap way to fill you up.

My husband has ordered the veggie burrito (not fusion) and I don't care for it too much.  They add broccoli and baby corn and some other things that I think make it a little strange.  But my husband likes it and that's all that matters.

I have a feeling meat-eaters really enjoy this place.

Good food, great prices, awesome people.  Definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Super good Food I would go here again the best place in Vegas. Good place to eat while you are getting your phone fixed next door"}
{"text":"Had the kimchi fried rice, pork belly taco, and bulgogi cheesesteak. Everything was really yummy. If you pay in cash you get 5% off your bill."}
{"text":"Got the Bulgogi fries.  It was pretty good, just needed more cheese.  Very good service at this location."}
{"text":"This was amazing!!! The tater tot bulgogi was fantastic! We went back a second time and got the same thing and wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place you have to try for yourself, if you're are into or require the following: 

a) greasy food
b) an option to fast food
c) high calories
d) a good hangover food

If your'e into healthy eating, then this is probably not the place for your.  The food was alright, but I felt so guilty and had to add extra time to my workout just to balance things out.  I didn't even eat a quarter of my Kimchi fried rice (it was SUPER greasy, heavy and just probably exceeded over 1000 calories).  The pork lettuce wraps were yummy, but again, that guilt feeling took over and I only had one.  

If you could careless about the caloric intake and greasy foods, this is a better option than say Jack n' the Box or Panda Express and especially Taco Bell; but in my opinion it's comparable.

Try it for yourself; I did and don't think I'll be back, but at least I tried it.  

My fortune cookie was hilarious though, it read:

\"Over prepare, then go with the flow\" [in bed].  haha!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very casual very mom and pop. But who cares cause it's the FOOD you're really here to enjoy! The service is solid the people are friendly and you cant beat the price. We got there at about 5:30pm on a Wednesday and the place was full.

We ordered the bulgogi nachos and the bulgogi burrito. The meat in the burrito was sooo tasty and the combination for the rice and beans and salsa mmmmm mmmmm good! The nachos...seriously I cant really remember cause we WOOFED it down sooo fast!!!  I was worried that the hot sauce would be too spicy so I asked for it on the side but it was just enough kick and it fused everything together!

I recommend to order a variety of dishes and do family style on your first visit so that way you can taste a little bit of all the tasty goodness....I could have just eaten the free chips salsa and guacamole all day....its not your regular chips but I wont give it away...just go and try it! 

This was definitely a winnah winnah chicken dinnah!!! (waving my shaka in the air)
Thank you mark m for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"Yelpers are correct! This place is something special. The food is delicious and they have great customer service. The fusion tacos, fusion flautas, bulgogi plate and fried rice were sooo good! Will definitely come back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I expected more from this place. Not worth the trip if you're on the strip."}
{"text":"Had to try this place after reading all of the awesome reviews.  I went on a Saturday afternoon around 3pm and all the booths were full.  The owner quickly mentioned there would be a 45 minute wait once our order was put in since they had so many before us.  We were able to snag a small table by the door and it took a little while for them to come take our order.  We ordered the Bulgogi Nacho's, which were absolutely amazing.  They were so flavorful and we were able to demolish the whole plate quickly.  I liked their homemade chips and guacamole as well.  Next came out our Daejiogoi Burrito with fried Kimchi, which we ended up taking to go since we were so full from the chips (burrito was good, but I will try it with bulgogi next time and without salsa).  I was also pleased with the egg Musubi and chicken taco.  The price and flavors cannot be beat!  I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Komex, the fusion of Korean and Mexican is great. I have tried several things on the menu and still come back. The flautas are one of my favorites. Even their Philly cheese steak and wings are good."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  What else can I say, the flavor and value of the food is unreal.  Careful during the lunch rush though.  It can get pretty packed in there.  It shows how good the food is."}
{"text":"One of the best finds in vegas, hands down.  Absolutely my new favorite place anywhere.  Fusion tacos? Just over a buck.  Giant portion of bulgogi nachos (best thing I've ever put in my mouth)  6 bucks!

I literally cant wait to be hungry again so I can go back.  Hands down amazing, great staff.  I always get food  to go, but the service has been great.  As someone who prides themself in seeking these places out, this is one of my top three finds ever.  Dont hesitate, try it out!"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the variety of the menu here because I've only ordered the same thing each time I go...and I dream about it. The veggie fusion chimichanga with kim chee is amazing! I forget how big it is until it arrives. There's enough to make two full lunches. Free chips, salsa and guac as well. They close out the meal with orange segments and fortune cookies. Worth the wait if there's a line."}
{"text":"Strange, but quite tasty. The restaurant looks kind of dingy, but the food far exceeded my expectations. The bulgogi anything is delicious -- the flavor of the beef is so excellent. Chips and salsa were also really tasty. Portions here are HUGE and for a good price! Service was also really friendly."}
{"text":"I loved it! It's a small place but super delicious! It's the perfect fusion, I had the chimichanga with beef and it was amazing! The staff was extremely friendly too!"}
{"text":"Stopped here during a trip to Las Vegas and we were extremely satisfied with the quality and uniqueness of the food served. Staff was friendly and efficient, and the food was superb. Never had a fusion of Mexican and Korean, but very happy we decided to try it. We ordered the beef nachos, chicken quesadilla, all three types of tacos, and the beef flautas. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Las Vegas or traveling through, you're sure to find something you like here at KoMex."}
{"text":"I love Komex.  Best fusion in Vegas, bulgogi nachos and burrito are fantastic."}
{"text":"Heard nothing but great things about this place, so was very excited to try it. Dined here about a month ago and it could not have been a better experience. Such a strange location on washington and decatur and parking lot is small but totally worth the drive. From the moment my brother and i walked in the service could not have been better. 

Had the calypso lemonade to drink and my brother had a mexican coke. I love, love, love lemonade and let me tell you this one ranks up their. A little sweeter than i prefer but still delicious. Mexican coke = always a winner.

Bulgogi fries = holy moly my friend these things are amazing, i love french fries and adding bulgogi and cheese and salsa and lots of onions, won me over real quick

Pork belly tacos, perfect amount of different flavors and the tortillas are grade A

Carne asada tacos, meat was perfectly flavored and cooked

Not that i mind spending $ on great food and great service but this is place is so cheap its crazy that they make $...g2 respect great service, i tipped 100% of the bill and when the server took the bill at the end of the meal and looked at the bill in the side station, she yelled \"thank you derek\", she then came over and we chatted a bit. 

Forget the servers name but wonderful woman, so friendly and genuine. Couldn't ask for someone better.

Even if your on the strip, it is worth the drive, trust me. This location is a little better on service than the new one but food is equally great at both."}
{"text":"I loveeeeeee it!!! The hubster and I have been wanting to try this place for ages and were glad we did. Service is really fast for a saturday night and the servers are quick and yoir order comes in quick. Only thing is the location is kinda \"hood\" but other than that I really love their food. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Good food. I ordered the Fusion Chimichanga...it was bbbiigggg. Every menu item was a pretty good sized portion. For $8 I'd say it was definitely worth it. The meat was tender and flavorful. Only thing I would say is that they're food wasn't really that spicy, I wouldn't even call it mild for my taste, so make sure you get some siracha or add some if you want that extra heat. 

They had good service, and fast too considering we had a really really big group. They gave us complimentary chips, salsa, and guac. Good stuff.

Next time I'm definitely going to try other stuff on the menu because everything looked and sounded good."}
{"text":"Bulgogi tacos & Korean pork tacos with kimchi are excellent. The wonton appetizers were great too. Lucky local Vegas residents to have this place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to try and came upon this fusion restaurant.  Service was great and food was pretty good.  The flavor of our entrees was good.  It's a casual place to eat and perfect for meeting up with friends.  There's even a happy hour and a bar."}
{"text":"Yelp has never let us down yet. We love the food here..affordable and was enough to fill up our bottomless pit son!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! I ABSOLUTLEY LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I have to admit when i saw the way it looked i was skeptical but man when they say don't judge a book by its cover this is defiintely on e of those places! AMAZING! The food was just awesome i had the fusion burrito that was gigantic for the price! It took me 3 sittings to finish that burrito! My husband had Bugogi and wow he was ready for seconds and even thirds the next day! i am so glad that it is close enough to if he wants Korean and i want Mexican all we have to do is go to KoMex!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was decent.  Didn't like the fact that they charge 20% gratuity on top of your food and tax.   My $43 bill came out to be $56!

I've never experienced the practice of adding gratuity on top of the tax before.  In addition, we were never told there would be an extra charge for 6 persons...

Enjoy the food, take a close look at your bill...."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices.   Never disappointed.  Grrat fusion if Korean and Mexican food.  Love the bulgogi fusion fries!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. The staff was great in taking our order amd getting our food out quickly. We had a group of 25 adults, teen and kids and we all enjoyed our food. As soon as we arrived our table was ready and when they took our order our food was out in a few minutes. Food was great and fresh. The complimentary chips are freaking good. Don't fill up on them because you will not be able to enjoy the food. The Bulgogi nachos rocked! The Kimchi Rice rocked! All the food that we ordered rocked. Sometimes going off the strip you find a great place to eat. Easy parking, no fussing with the casino and getting lost and for the cost of a buffet you can actually order a wide variety of their food and still have change!"}
{"text":"i got bulgogi and shrimp tacos. bf got beef chimichonga. portions were generous for the price. flavors were amazing. service was great too. would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I go to Vegas quite a bit and hate eating on the strip or ordering room service.  This place is a must is you consider yourself a foodie."}
{"text":"I love random little places like these, they really surprise you sometimes. 

KoMex has some really good food- just pick anything off the menu, you won't be disappointed. Delicious & ADDICTING food, service with a smile, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Stop by for a quick lunch.  Service was great and the food comes out fast!  Not to mention, they have amazing Korean Mexican tacos.  Basically, Korean marinated meat inside a taco. I've been craving their tacos ever since I tried it.  This place is defiantly worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, food is really good prices are very responsible! I have the tostada with beef and chicken wings! The tostada was awesome, the wings where good too!!!!"}
{"text":"Me gusta esta fusión de sabores.
Lo mejor... los tacos!!!.
La chimichanga .... riquisima!

Lo recomiendo ampliamente."}
{"text":"I had always heard about this place, but had never gotten around to going, until one day I decided to try it for myself.  I had a beef burrito and it was one of the most interesting creations I've ever tasted.  The beef was delicious and all of the ingredients worked together perfectly.  That being said, it totally worked for me, and I loved the sauces available to put on the burrito.  I will definitely be paying them many more visits."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. You can't go wrong order anything. My favorite is the Bulgogi nachos"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Salsa and guacamole was yummy! Their bathroom is really dirty tho. I wouldnt be surprised if they will be on dirty dining soon."}
{"text":"Good food for good prices! Everything tastes good... I find it so weird that they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"This place is the tits. Am I allowed to say that? The only reason I wouldn't tell everyone I know to go there is because I don't want the line to be too long when I go for another round of spam musubi. If you're not sure what to get, try the tacos. They're super cheap and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my go to spots for years now. If you like a bit of a twist on traditional Korean and Mexican food this is your place ! Customer service is always on point and  I haven't had anything  from here that wasn't top notch! I appreciate the time and dedication these folk put into their craft. Thank you Komex!"}
{"text":"This is for takeout only.  Will reassess dine-in at some later point.  This Korean Mexican fusion really fills a culinary niche that I know will leave me with a very specific craving in the future.  Good size portions at a reasonable price.  I had the burrito w/chicken.  Adding a touch of he Korean sauce made for a delicious meal.  For you vegetarians, I understand that the veggie tofu fried rice is really good!"}
{"text":"I loved it! Can't wait for them to open their new location that will be much closer to home."}
{"text":"2 stars: Meh. I've experienced better. 

I've started to identify these restaurants that are Yelp hype-magnets.

They have super high ratings, are generally budget friendly, yet aren't very good when you actually go there to try the food. 

I suspected this place was one of these places. 

I ordered a few different tacos, the kimchi fried rice, and washed it all down with a sidral mundet.

So you get little tacos and a big platter of fried rice.

The meat quality was average, the seasonings were basic, and the fried rice was copious in quantity, but the kimchi was pretty pathetic and the dish wasn't very good. 

There are so many hole in the walls that are truly excellent.

This isn't one of them.

Maybe it's because the place has blown up that it's resting on its yelp laurels? 

When I went, there were a couple Mexican families and a few hipsters eating there. 

And from what I've noticed, hipsters don't know good food if it smacked the horned rim glasses off their heads. 

If it had been truly a good spot, I'd have recommended it, and returned time and time again, but it really was very basic food and not really worth making a special trip that way to go eat there. 

If you live down the street, you can praise it to the skies, but for anyone in town for just a few days, this place is an easy pass."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night, got the Bulgogi Slider special.  Delicious!!!  Added a Fusion taco on flour tortilla with chicken and kimchi.  Perfect meal to end the night on!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I don't get what the big deal is.  

We ordered a bunch of different things and honestly nothing stood out.  Food was bland.  Meat quality was subpar.  Restaurant interior was boring.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the bulgogi fries! So much better than carne asada fries. Kimchee fried rice is so awesome too! Reasonable prices and they give you lots of food. My hubby & I had enough leftovers for the next two days."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Definitely a hidden gem in Vegas.  You would need a car to get there unfortunately, but I'm sure its only a matter of time before they end up on the strip somewhere, no doubt they will do very well.  Service was amazing - friendly and fast.  Food was excellet - great quality. Had the Burrito with Kimchi and the Kimchi had a really nice flavor to it.  I Highly recommend it.  Price was surprisingly cheap, but I think that's because its geared more towards the people that live in Vegas, rather than visiting..."}
{"text":"food is good.service needs improvement. i think they are short staff. my boyfriend and i went last night around 6pm was seated right away. the lady i think might be the owner took our order after 5 minutes. we waited 15 more minutes for water and 10 more minutes for the salsa and chips. when the chip and salsa finally came i show the lady the special check in deal on yelp for the free wanton she said ok.  my boyfriend love their special sauce which he had to go up to the counter to asked for.they were so busy. we didn't get any type of service till the bill.at this point we still didn't get our free check in wanton but didn't want to wait any more.they usual give you  a orange and fortune cookies at the end of the meal. the lady apologized  they had just run out of orange and left us with ONE fortune cookie for the TWO of us. i was disappointed. overall, it's good food for the price. they give a large portion but for sure need improvement on their service.one more thing, i'm sensitive to MSG and  i think they do used MSG in their seasoning."}
{"text":"When I read reviews I had to get to this place... here I am, in my car just ordered and so I wait... thing is.. first impression is everything... smelled good.. clean... but waitress didn't even Notice me at first.. when she finally did she was very nice. She sent me to the counter to order where Mr. Ken didn't even look at me... so much for first impressions. I felt like I was bothering him. I ordered beef fried rice.. bulgogi.. and chicken wings. I hope the food is better than the service.. geez..
Still waiting for my food over 40 mins later.. r they killing the chicken back there!
Update.. I got my food 10 seconds after I hit post... when the waitress handed me the bag she said \" u picked the wrong time... next time call in your order\" now.. of course I know what she intended by that but really??? Shld there be a \"wrong time\"? Oh next time I will come when everyone is twiddling their thumbs! Hhmph... if I had sat down wld. I HV received my food quicker? Why? I was the ONLY take out order and then a boy came after me who incidently got his order b4 me. Ooh.. Mr. Ken said it was BC of the wings I ordered.. they take 20 mins.. let's talk about those.. 8 Wingdings! Not wings... dry as hell.. the coating on top of the chicken was spicy and sweet.. decent enough.. but clearly the meat wasn't seasoned.. just slapped sauce on dry ass chicken.. clearly 20 mins too long Mr. Ken... u cold HV apologized for my long wait.. that wild HV been acceptable.. maybe offered.me some quac and chips for my trouble.. I guess some things are too much to ask... I also ordered the rice.. it would have been good if I cldnt taste old grease flavor peeking through.. 18.00 and a waste of my time.  pick another spot.. I tried it and they get a big fat F.... 
Fee"}
{"text":"Totally a hole in the wall but oh so good! The decor is outdated with very cushy booth seating but the service is quick and friendly. We got the bulgogi burrito that was huge that I shared with my bf. The galbi tacos were delicious and packed that I made 2 tacos since there's 2 pieces of tortilla. My bf said that this was by far the best galbi tacos that he's tasted and we're from LA! 
Did I mention the homemade chips with the yummy guac and salsa that they first bring out? YUM!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend at work and I didn't really think much of it at first. And then two other random people recommended it and I thought, ok, I'll go give it a try. The food at this place is really great. Very unique fusion and amazing flavors. It's not fast food so there's a bit of a wait but it's worth it. I would definitely eat here again. Good place to take friends and out-of-towners for something unique."}
{"text":"Good: If you want flavorful family made food that is a mix of asian and mexican at a low price then you have found your restaurant! I love to come here about once a month and everytime I am fully satisfied with the food and the great customer service. The family who owns the restaurant is very friendly and cares about their customers.

Bad: Can get busy at times (especially around lunch time) but what do you expect when the food is so good? I also wish they added desserts to their menu!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and taste!
You must try new taco taste in Vegas.
My daughter and I also like Kimchi Fried rice.
Fish and shrimp tacos are the best!!"}
{"text":"They seated us within a few Minutes which was nice, they were busy but not packed. 
Our waitress (her name wasn't on the check and she did not wear a name tag) was very nice and helped me by explaining the vegetarian options. I got the tofu torta and it was awesome! I love when people are so helpful in explaining menu alternatives. My friends really liked their (meat) dishes as well."}
{"text":"This place well exceeds my 3 criteria for awesomeness.  Quality Taste, Quantity, and great price!  Definitely a winner."}
{"text":"Love this place, they have the best tofu & veggie tacos ever, even better if you add kimchi. Also have awesome veggie fried rice (one of few places that is generous with the veggies), amazing complimentary chips with side of guac & fresh salsa. There is an  exceptional array of host made sauces- so good we get one of them to go and enjoy with all sorts of food at home (Korean hot sauce). Lastly, their prices rock & they recognize their regular customers."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing and very reasonably priced.  The nachos are a must have.  Don't be put off by the location and/or setting of the restaurant, this is the \"hole in the wall\" place.  Worth the drive and trying to find a parking spot.  Just be advised that they are not open on Monday."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best tacos I've  had the privilege of having..  can't beat the price either..."}
{"text":"Short: Surprisingly great fusion place. Reasonable prices, great flavor, in an older part of town.

Long: Came here with a friend. Ordered three tacos with the three types of meat (there are more, for extra). Came with cabbage slaw and some \"salsa\" on top (not spicy, but wouldn't call it pico-de-gallo). Afterward, was served chips with salsa and guacamole (kinda watered down, though). 
Food was great. All the meats had strong flavor, the slaw on top contrasted with them nicely. I think I liked the beef best (forgot which one was which). What really surprised me was the side-sauces that were a real treat for someone like me. Nice touch.
You do pay a small premium though. $2 for each taco is a bit much when they're not full sized, as you can get around the same size in other places for $1.25/75. 

Come here if you want to try a different spin on mexican food. There's better places out there, but not as unique as this one."}
{"text":"We loved it!
The kimchi rice and pork belly musubi was so good.
The sliders were also very good if not some of the best fusion sliders I have had the opportunity to enjoy.
The nachos, a half order which is large enough for the four of us, are a game changer as far as nachos go.  The sauce is sooo good.
But the favorite dish for the four of us was the spicy pork enchiladas.  We will make the 300+ mile trip just for the enchiladas!"}
{"text":"The Korean-Mexican-Chinese fusion they have at this place may sound strange at first, but KoMex does a good job of making this style of cooking work. I had a tofu and bean burrito, which was very good, even if it seemed light on the beans. My friend had the bulgogi burrito, which he said was excellent. 

Our server was very friendly and fairly attentive, although she seemed ever so slightly annoyed that we hadn't ordered ahead of time over the phone. They have a sign there explaining that all of their meals are cooked as soon as you order it, so as to keep it fresh. This was good to know, but our order took quite a long time considering we only had burritos with no side orders or appetizers.

In summary, 

Pros:
-Good value
-Great food
-Friendly service

Cons:
-If you don't order ahead of time, you'll probably be waiting a while"}
{"text":"We just wanted to see where the place is, but ended up having a small lunch snack.
Lunch consisted of 1 fusian taco with pork belly on corn tortilla, 1 fusion taco in lettuce wrap, 1 bbq pulled pork slider, 1 pork fusion slider, and a half order of Bulgogi fries.
The service was excellent, the food was great, and it is very reasonable.
Las Vegas needs more places like this!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Had 1 each of the tacos. Service was perfect. Tacos were very good. The restaurant met the high expectations I had prior to dining. Complimentary chips, salsa and guac were even good! Will come back often for lunch!"}
{"text":"Go now!!!!! Complimentary chips with REAL GUAC and salsa!!!! Had the bulgogi tacos beef, chicken, and pork. Beef and chicken were my fav!"}
{"text":"I live all the way on the other side of town but always have to make the trip to eat here at least once a month. The menu has a wide variety of food from mexican to korean. I love both kinds of food so i think it's a genius fusion! They give everybody free chips and salsa in the beginning of the meal, and usually give orange slices at the end. The one thing i always have to order is the bulgogi fried rice. It's delicious and comes in a huge portion! I also always try to order something new and so far, i haven't ordered anything i didnt like. Luckily, everything is so cheap here, i dont feel guilty for ordering a bunch of stuff! Usually when a place has good food for cheap prices, the staff isn't so great... But not this place! The workers are always friendly and attentive, even when they're busy with every single table filled and more people waiting at the door! 

I highly suggest this place. It does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I see why this place is so popular, the idea of Korean food and Mexican mixed into one seems weird, but once you try there taco's! Yummy!"}
{"text":"This is one of those Yelp finds that lives up to its hype. A little dumpy dive in the depressed west Vegas burbs. I wasn't expecting much. Oh man, the food was really good, really unique, and cheap. Had tacos, tostada, etc.. They bring a salsa spinner to the table, and it's all excellent. And at the end, you get a fresh, cold orange for dessert."}
{"text":"The wait staff is fantastic, and I really enjoyed my food. I had the Korean beef nachos (half order) and then 2 tacos (beef and chicken). The tacos were ok, but to be honest nothing spectacular. The nachos stole the show for me, and I enjoyed every aspect of them. They have the perfect combination of spicy, sweet, and crunchy. I will say that I bet a lot of people would want them spicier, but they were perfect for me.

The one drawback seems to be their drink selection. I think that they should invest in a soda delivery system - this would make me raise my review by a star for sure."}
{"text":"Great food at a resonable price. So good you don't even mind the older small dining area. The have plans to update the dining area soon. The best items are the fusion menu items: enchiladas, nachos, and toastadas. The best meat is the pork by far. If you eat pork skip the others meats if you don't try the beef. Great value for flavors and porition sizes."}
{"text":"Great food.  Decor isn't the best, but if you want decor, go to the strip.  If you want great food, go here."}
{"text":"They start you off with chips and salsa. I ordered the Bulgogi cheesesteak with a single fish taco, sooo good my mouth is watering thinking about it.   A good change from eating on the strip and a lot less expensive. Clean, easy parking and friendly service."}
{"text":"We got the bulgogi fries and bulgogi flautas. Those two dishes were more than enough for two people. We will be eating the rest for dinner. I loved that they used flour tortillas for their flautas and chips. Make sure to get the sauce tray because they have a house mix of salsas that are wonderful. The guac that came with the flautas was mixed with a Korean sweet sauce which was awesome and gave a little extra flavor to the food. You can tell everything is super fresh and hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for hours."}
{"text":"Went to this hole in the wall restaurant on a friend's recommendation as well as the superb Yelp rating.  Location is in a strip shopping center and supposedly the interior has been recently updated.  Started off with their fusion bulgogi fries which was very good - covered in cheese and meat.  Followed by their fusion tacos - one of each meat with the bulgogi being my favorite meat.  My wife really enjoyed the fusion burrito with chicken.  The mango/passionfruit unsweetened tea was a bit to sutle for my tastes.  Great food with equally wonderful prices."}
{"text":"Had lunch here while drive through Vegas, that we came back for more on our way home from Utah! Loved how we had 4 hot sauce options and portions are huge. Staff is very friendly and attentive. The tofu and slaw and enchiladas were the best!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for yelp - we would have never known about this awesome place!  We read the reviews and went for late lunch after 2pm and it was great, no wait!  The server said they had a crazy lunch hours where people had to wait hours in the parking lot!"}

When it comes to bulgogi tacos it doesn't get any better. What? Exactly. These aren't your typical tacos here, they take tacos to another dimension. This family-run gem has an awesome mix of food. Korean-Mexican fusion! Who knew?

They have a decent sized menu here with Korean food, Chinese food, Mexican, Korean, and of course the fusion. They even have burgers on the menu which my 5 year old son enjoyed.

Thank you Yelp! I would not have found this place if not for this site. I'm surprised to see anything below 4 stars for this place, but I guess people have different tastes. If you typically like Mexican and Asian cuisines I would recommend this highly. Try something from the fusion menu - it is fantastic!"}
{"text":"The place looks a little sketchy from the outside and doesn't have any fancy decor...But WOW! They have really good tacos! Come here for the food not the ambiance.
The food is great, the service is friendly, and the prices are cheap. A little slower than other lunch eateries but worth the wait."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't very busy so service was very fast. Ordered bulgogi beef tacos and pork belly tacos. We took it to go so we didn't have a chance to try their complimentary chips and salsa but we did get their \"chunky\" salsa. The salsa has a hint of Korean flavors almost like a kimchi salsa and so hot I was almost seeing colors, I love it!. I've never had bulgogi style beef so I didn't know what to expect. It was tender and mildly sweet. It was plentiful and flavorful. The pork belly had a good flavor but it just didn't mesh well on a taco. I will dream of the bulgogi nachos tonight!"}
{"text":"Was very satisfied with the Beef Burrito a very awesome place to go and fulfill your mexican food craving ...will be coming back for more"}
{"text":"Disappointed after reading all the reviews.  Had the kimchi beef fried rice and barely ate any of it.  The kimchi flavor was so overpowering, I could hardly taste anything else (and it's not like I'm not used to the flavor - I'm half Asian and was raised on Asian food).  There was hardly any beef in it (trust me, I dug through the pile of rice looking for it).  That said, the portions are huge and the service was nice.  I just wish I had ordered something else."}
{"text":"this place is by far the best hole in a wall, fusion food joint that i have ever been to. they have very good customer service and it seems like anything that comes out of their kitchen is amazingly good. their food is so addicting! i eat there at least 3 times a week.  their menu is also very reasonably priced and they come in good portions. definitely a must if you haven't tried yet. you will be glad you tried it because its so good or mad because you''ll be spending all your money there to try everything."}
{"text":"In from out of town and discovered this jewel of a restaurant. The fusion of Korean and Mexican cuisines is  phenomenal. It was like a party in my mouth. I strongly recommend that everyone give it a try. You will not be disappointed!!!

{"text":"Insanely good!  In a town with so much overpriced crappy food, I needed a fix like this so dearly. Without a doubt, the very best thing I ate while in Vegas was a Kimchi burrito. The wife had the chicken tacos with kimchi. She couldn't talk... Just kept saying \"mmmm\" with a full mouth. I went here on a whim after reading some Yelp reviews on my way to the LV airport. Thanks Yelpers!!! I'm so glad I went here. You're definitely not going here for the ambiance - just so damn good cheap eats."}
{"text":"A little nervous when we got there and it wasn't busy, but by the end of our meal place was packed and had a lot of to go orders.  Loved the pork belly and kimchi fried rice.  Husband can't wait to have another burrito and the kids couldn't get enough of the tortilla chips.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I read all the great comments thinking this place would be a great find. To my disappointment, I was not pleased. 

The service was very slow, even though it wasn't very busy. There were even other customers complaining asking where their food was. Come to find out, the food was just sitting on top of the counter waiting to be served. Another couple next to us paid for their drinks and left after waiting way too long for their food. 

We finally got our food after about 30 mins. We ordered the bulgogi fries, combination fried rice and the bulgogi burrito. Everything just tasted average. Nothing to rave about. 

I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a new Vegas tradition for us. Found this place off-strip on our way out of town and decided to try something new.

We ordered a buffet fit for kings, bulgogi burrito, bulgogi and kimchi nachoes, stir fry, wontons. Yum. The food was delicious. I don't think you can order the wrong thing here, it's all good."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall type of place,but such a treasure. It looks pretty sketchy out front but inside is quant. Food is very reasonable and inventive! Being of mixed heritage descent I love fusion! Well as long as it is not too Americanized. This place was recommended by a stage hand from the iHeart Radio festival. 

So good! I had the spicy pork chimichaga and my sister has the pork nachos. My brother in law had a few tacos which the meat in each was delicious (i cant remember which he got, a variety). Average taco sizes. Huge portions and would have been under $30 if we didn't order a drink. Would definitely go here again, YUM!

Also side note, the crowd is of all ethnicities and seems to be generally non touristy which is so difficult to find in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch.   Not to be missed.   Had the beef bulgogi nachos.   They are fantastic.   The hot sauces they give you are some of the best I have had.   Also had 3 tacos,  the calamari is fantastic,  a must try.   Two people ate for 13 dollars."}
{"text":"My family went there for the first time. As it was recommended by a friend. The food was great and at the price, the portions were BIG!!! Cant wait to go back and try something else!!!!"}
{"text":"After going to Komex for a year quite often, I have to say that I have never been disappointed by any of the food.  My favorite is the combo fried rice.  They also have kimchi which is so fresh! Fried wontons... chicken teriyaki... I could go on and on."}
{"text":"If it weren't for Yelp, I would've never discovered this place! This place is just full of delicious food. Before this, I had never had Korean-Mexican fusion food, but KoMex has made me a convert! 

If you eat there instead of ordering take-out, they give you free homemade chips and salsa/guacamole. The fusion items come with a choice of 3 different meats (beef, pork, or chicken), fish, shrimp, and vegetarian. Kimchi can be added on to any fusion dish if requested, but I'm not a fan of the sour element kimchi adds, I'd rather add lime. I always get the fusion tacos, burrito, nachos, or bulgogi beef fried rice. I usually prefer chicken, but there's just something about their bulgogi beef that has me coming back for more. Portions are huge and prices are reasonable (although I've noticed they recently increased their prices by a small margin). I admit I haven't tried their Asian or Mexican dishes yet, so that'll be on my list next time I go. All in all, every friend I have brought to KoMex has loved it!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to Komex for a while and I'm glad I finally did! I got the half order teriyaki plate which was more than enough for me, I ended up taking some home. 

The waitress was cute and friendly. The chips and guac that they bring out are GOOD. I had to ask for more guac because my brother didn't want to share. 

We went in kind of late so it wasn't too busy. The only negative I can even think of was that as we were leaving there was a really gross old fish smell...it was really quite nauseating. It definitely wasn't there when we arrived otherwise I can't say we would have stayed, it was that bad.

However I'm not even sure it's the restaurants fault so I am still giving 5 stars and I would definitely recommend you eat here :)"}
{"text":"Great price
Fresh
Big portion
Yummy food"}
{"text":"We've been going here since it opened, never fails to disappoint, always fulfills that itch.
I want to have a relationship with the spicy pork. :drool"}
{"text":"No reason not to eat here. Looks to be a family owned place, inside is very clean, one good tv and a nice bar set up.  

Incredibly affordable prices and the food was super tasty. Had the sliders as an appetizer, and there was probably too much meat. I had the beef bowl with the fried egg on top. A combination of the spicy peppers and their Korean sauce had me sweating pretty good as I ate, and I loved it. 

Flautas were good too, 3 very good sized pieces. They also had Mexican coke in the glass bottle which is always nice. 

3 items + the coke was only $27. Felt like it should have been more for how good it was. Definitely will return.

I would go just for the complimentary chips and salsa/guac. Chips were great."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled across this place while looking for apartments. We were attracted to the name because we usually never come across any mexican/korean restaurant on our side of town. We both shared an order of the pork belly street style tacos and loved it! Customer service was awesome! We will definitely come back if we're  ever in the area!"}
{"text":"And this is why you shouldn't put your trust in humanity. How could such a mediocre food establishment obtain the coveted 4.5 stars with close to 1,000 reviews? Coincidence? I think not. Upon reading the 4 recommend reviews tied between extreme love and hate, I decided to trust the consensus.. Mistake. I should've have trusted Mandi L's pinpointed summary of this joint. 

Upon browsing the menu, a feeling of uneasiness began to set in. Fusion? What fusion? The only condiment separating this spot from a Los Betos was a Korean slaw-- your typical vinegar slaw, disguising itself as an Asian stalple via soy sauce. 

We ask the waiter/cashier for his recommendations-- he says the chimichanga and cheesesteak. A man at the table next to us is praising the cheesesteak so we oblige-- obviously electing beef for the cheesesteak, and pork for the chimi, per recommendation. The plates walked down the aisle to our table with a salsa platter-- two Mexican salsas, and two Korean sauces. Upon first bite, I hit a void of flavor. For the remainder of my meal, I found myself dousing each bite with both sweet and hot Korean sauces-- craving to make my sad Mexican/Philly meal reach the fictions land of fusion-- but I was left in limbo. 

I didn't mention the stacks of cheap-ass 80pack corn tortillas lining the kitchen window, nor the weird pita chips that served as \"fusion\" chips and salsa, or the fact I didn't get my 8oz water glass filled once during my meal-- because they didn't affect the overall mediocrity of this meal. Unless you want to help diminish Komex's star rating to something more accurate (2-3 stars) and prevent future yelpers from being led astray, don't go here."}
{"text":"What a great strip mall find! On our way back to the hotel after a soccer game and the boys took over. The price was great, burritos were even better and they had spam musubi! We will be back every time we play at Ed Fountain park."}
{"text":"First time here and surely not the last. We think they serve the best spicy pork tacos. They also make great Bulgogi tacos. The chicken tacos were nice but a bit bland in comparison to the pork or Bulgogi.  Great sliders as well."}
{"text":"I had the bulgogi nachos and the thing was massive. As I was eating it I was in a state of euphoria for about 20 minutes. It had a unique taste that I had never experienced and was very delicious."}
{"text":"From world of mouth via friends, I was looking forward to trying this place. It's a bit out of the way for me, but I found myself in the general area today and thought it would be a perfect time to check it out. We were there at 2 pm, the restaurant was completely empty. I was not deterred based on all the great reviews their N. Decatur location had received. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful on choosing what to order. I naturally wanted to eat everything - but managed to narrow it down to the bulgogi Fusion Chimichanga. Go big, or go home. Right? It was loaded with flavor! My friend tried a trio of meats (pork, chicken, steak) with the Fusion Enchiladas. We both loved our dishes, made even better by the quad of sauces brought to the table. I found the sweet chili, and the Asian style chili sauce to be the best toppings. 

Originally I had meant to order the biggest thing, and take a good portion home for my husband to try. (He was very jealous that we had gone without him.). But, I found myself inhaling the chimichanga and ended up just taking home the butt end of it. Sorry Hubs! I look forward to coming here again soon and trying more things. I have to add that my friend is quite particular in what she does and doesn't like, and she really loved her meal. 

 KoMex Fusion lives up to its hype. If you have schizophrenic taste buds like mine, you'll love this place. Sweet, spicy, salty, savory....yummmmm.  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty decent with the fusion but it is super greasy. It would be perfect if you're hungover. Also just a note the portions are MASSIVE and you definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"decided to give this place a try since of all the reviews.  

Nice staff.

 But i just found this place just to be on a salty side. There is definitely some interesting combinations but nothing that I would re order again or come back for."}
{"text":"Finally got over to this place! It's a bit hidden in a tiny strip mall type building but easy enough to find. The food was very good, no complaints at all. I tried the tacos (one of each) and two burritos, one regular and one fusion. I prefered the regular burrito to the fusion one, it seemed to have a bit more flavor. I prefer the burritos at Cafe Rio, these are about the same size (huge) but not quite as good. 

The standout was the tacos, spefically the beef ones, these are what is gonna get me back there. The flavor was excellent and the price is right! Worth checking out for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here looking for some Korean/Mexican fusion and KoMex delivered. As the sign in their restaurant points out, KoMex is not fast food, but this little hole in the wall is very much casual. This place is all about the food and my favorite was the calamari taco! Crispy panko crusted on the outside and hot tenderness on the inside. A little lime and pico de gallo makes it perfect. 

The bulgogi chimichanga was great as well but it had just a little too much cheese for me personally. I'll be back the next time I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"This second location simply does not compare to the first location, which I love.  My fiance and I went there the day after the \"grand opening\" and ordered kimchi fried rice and bulgogi burrito.  Burrito - we were not sure if the meat was even marinated.  Kimchi fried rice - just meh.  I might have had the food poisoning - I puked up everything that night.  Also, there were only 2 other tables, but the service was still agonizingly slow.  I really can't think of anything nice to say and not sure why there are so many glowing reviews.  NOT RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"Best food for the price in Vegas. Spoo yummy. Definitely worth the 10-minute drive from the strip."}
{"text":"First yelp recommended restaurant and it was really good! Chicken fried rice and a bulgogi plate with spicy pork and fried vegetable so so good!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love their food. Tastes fresh. You can tell they use quality ingredients. This is not fast food. It takes time, but it's worth it.  If only I lived closer to Komex..."}
{"text":"When I first heard of KoMex I was a skeptic.  As I am always unwilling to try anything new, and definitely anything fusion. However I ordered the Chimichanga. And was BLOWN away!  I love mom and pop, hole in the walls. And The smiling Korean lady, made it that much more pleasant. The food is fabulous, the service was great.  My second visit, I had the enchiladas, and tacos. And I have now found my new \"Comfort food\" place to eat. The price is great for that budget hunter. And you get your fill and then some.   Thanks to Yelp, and to friends we found this place. And RECOMMEND IT!!  Love love it!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed, carne asada had a lot of chewy parts, flavor wasn't good. Will not return."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have always loved it!  The food is fantastic, Korean Mexican Fusion!  The spices and seasonings blend so well together, the prices are great and I always leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"Affordable, filling and amazing service?! Yes please! I have only been coming in since the start of the year. I had been hearing about this place from other students from school and wanted to see what the \"hype\" is all about. If you want affordable food with the quality to match, this is the place to go. I bring my friends with \"big appetites\" and they leave satisfied without burning a hole through their pockets. I myself, am I big fan of the Mexican taquitos, lettuce wraps, fusion tacos (try their pork belly fusion tacos!) and the bulgogi fried rice. Everyone is incredibly nice and it keeps me coming back! (maybe more than I should). If you have not tried KoMex, try it once! You won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"This is so unique & awesome!  We also had a small wedding reception at the Durango location, plates licked clean by all!!  If you're into trying some old favorites or something new in fusion, this is s must try, Kudos!!"}
{"text":"I come here on my way home from work and order something for to go. I've had several of their dishes and all are excellent!  Every time I come here, I always order their musubi.  One spam and one pork belly musibi, they are awesome!  The service is always excellent and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Had a meal at Komex while on a short stopover in Vegas and LOVED it! Good vegetarian options. Big portion sizes. Great blend of flavors. We were very pleased and well fed. I got a veggie burrito and vegetable fettuccine noodles. All delicious!"}
{"text":"I honestly love the Korean Mexican fusion food.  The person who put Korean BBQ in a taco is a genius.  That being said, I ordered the bulgogi tacos and the chicken wings.  Both were delicious!  I wish I could've tried more food, but I wasn't super hungry.

The table next to me ordered the tostadas and kim chi fried rice.  Gotta get that next time because they looked bomb diggity!"}
{"text":"Everything I have had here has been good.  That especially goes for the bulgogi fries and fried rice.  Decently priced and the hot sauce is incredible."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing and very cheap for great quality of food.  My 10 year old son said eating here was one of the highlights of his trip to Las Vegas.  I ordered a bulgogi burrito that could have feed a family of four.  The rest of my family got Asian food and the portions were also huge.   Chips, salsa and guac were also very good and the service was EXCELLENT.  Wish we had one of these in my home town.  Would definately go back on a future trip to Vegas.  It isn't on the strip but it isn't far if you have a car.   If we would have known how large the portions were are family of 4 could have eatten for $10!  Can't do that on the strip!  The best  and cheapest meal we had during our week trip to Las Vegas, Grand Canyon and Utah!!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME! This place is great. I was in Vegas for a couple days and got sick of the strip real quick. We checked this place out because of the great reviews on Yelp. Never would have guessed that it was so good, it's not a looker from the outside... in a strip mall. But, Yelp didn't let us down! I had the bulgogi tacos with kimchi. SO GOOD. The owners are super nice. And there's a newspaper article cut out and framed on the wall describing how this little gem of a restaurant was actually saved by Yelpers. This place is cheap, delicious and definitely worth checking out if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"this place is DELICIOUS! the workers are very nice, the portions they give are HUGE and full of flavor. you can eat in or take out and no matter what, the food is always the best quality. they have mexican, chinese, and korean food and everything always has a good twist to it. i recommend the fusion tacos with chicken and a lettuce shell, and also the orange chicken where you get a BIG serving of orange chicken and white rice. they have something to offer for everyone and its not expensive at all so go try it!! :D"}
{"text":"I just don't get why everyone goes crazy for this place, we went here for lunch and I had hear a lot of good thing about this place so I was looking forward to it 
I order the Asada tacos, let me tell you, Meat had no flavor , salsa needed salt n pepper  big dissapoinment  Damn even the gas stations out here in California have better tasting tacos ,  I think this place should stick to eatheir Mexican or Korean and focus on the flavors.      Not worth your money. This place has nothing on tacos el gordo"}
{"text":"The teriyaki and white rice plate was good but I would not recommend the rice cake tostada the rice was very hard. I did feel extremely rushed by the waiter.  
I understand he was there by himself but when I go somewhere I want to sit down and relax to eat I don't want to feel like I cannot take my time ordering. 
He was also short of patients explaining the menu."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful concept, perfectly executed.  Sauces, tacos, bowls...all just incredible.

The KOMEX sauce is so tasty it's drinkable."}
{"text":"Had to wait a while, but the waitress definitely made up for in and was courteous that we were in a time crunch. I highly recommend the chimichonga. Best one of my life (if you like cheese.)"}
{"text":"Great cheap food here AND they serve it with kimchi (upon request).  It's a hole in the ghetto-y part are Las Vegas, but you'll be paying almost nothing for a full, yummy meal with (yes) free bottled water. The bulgogi fried rice was awesome!  I also enjoyed the bulgogi taco and pork taco, both of which were tasty.  Lastly, the owner (I think she was the owner) was super nice.    I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Komex is a great restaurant with a nice and welcoming staff. If you love both Korean food and Mexican you can't go wrong with coming here. If you don't feel that adventurous have no fear Komex still offers more traditional Korean and Mexican dishes, which are still very good. The fusion is definitely the best part though! 

I highly recommend eating in, as they give you a basket of fresh homemade chips! Everything feels fresh and homemade. It's just a great place to eat, and you can tell your friends \"Yeah, I had Komex for lunch.\""}
{"text":"Great place; try everything.  Just remember all food is cooked to order... so don't be in a rush. If you are, call head and order to go."}
{"text":"In my hometown, there's a food truck called Mogos which is Korean Mexican fusion.  Their burritos are delicious.  When my classmate told me about Komex, I was extremely excited because I don't go back to my hometown often enough to get my Korean Mexican fusion fix.  It's a really small, hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant maybe 6-7 tables at the most.  They don't serve fountain drinks, just bottled beverages. They have a variety of meals on the menu, and I ordered the bulgogi fries & the bulgogi burrito (for my lunch the next day).  The fries were no more than $10 and the burrito was no more than $7, and their portions were HUGE!  Considering how expensive bulgogi usually is, I didn't expect that much meat in my meals, but I am completely satisfied with the portion sizes.  As I mentioned before, I ordered the burrito for my lunch the next day.   I was a little hesitant about that because burritos are not usually good the next day, but I hadn't gone grocery shopping & needed a meal for my 12 hour shift, so I just decided to give it a go.  I'm glad I did, because it was perfectly fine the next day and I really enjoyed my lunch.  

Not only was the food excellent, the service was as well.  I was greeted & served by an older lady (maybe the owner?) and she was very chipper and professional.  Even though the burritos come with pico de gallo, she always asked if I still wanted it inside the burrito or on the side.  I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is worth 10 stars!

I always take guests here from out of town because the korean mexican fusion concept is intriguing, yet so deliciously logical!

Food is simply amazing and the prices are so reasonable, especially for the large portions they serve!

This restaurant is hands down worth a trip if you are visiting from the Strip, and equally a hidden gem for locals looking to impress visitors!"}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem! We had the bulgogi tater tots, the fusion flautas and a shrimp taco. Everything was amazing and the service was great as well! This is definitely the new spot."}
{"text":"Have a craving for Asian food but want Mexican grub? This is the best of both worlds! All of the fusion dishes are full of flavor and spice. Warning: spice level is not for the faint of heart. The spicy pork will set your mouth on fire. Bulgogi fusion burrito is a must try! The fried rice dishes also hit the spot. 

My only complaint is that there isn't more than one location, since the restaurant is way off-Strip."}
{"text":"You want cheap eats and delicious food and be full for around $12 for two people? Come here. No, really, don't, because the parking lot is small as hell. It's tucked away in a tiny plaza with the smallest parking ever. Not bad at all during the weekday and off-hours though.

The place itself is tiny. There's only one big group table for 5+, but there's about seven-to-eight tables for 4-people. So if you plan on coming with a big group on a friday/saturday night, it's ideal to call ahead and make a reservation. Komex also does pick-up orders. 

I've been here several times and it never disappoints. 

Chips, salsa, and guacamole are complimentary starters here. 

First-timers ought to order their fusion tacos! Tacos are about $2.25 each and you get 3 choices for meat: spicy pork, chicken, or beef (pork is the best!). If you're hungry, 3 is enough for most people. They load that taco up with lettuce, tomatoes, and meat. What makes it fusion? The way they prepare their meat! Korean-style supposedly. The meat isn't fatty or overly greasy. The tacos are balanced well with the overflowing sliced cabbage and rich flavor of the meat. 

For the health-conscious, they do offer the taco on butterfly cabbage instead of your normal flour/corn tortilla on the menu. Trust me, somehow it's bigger. You want kimchi too? They offer it as an extra cost as well.

If you're ordering their fried rice (kimchi/regular) or bulgogi fries, they offer both half-size and full-size orders. Their half-orders are formidable! Split-worthy huge. Their full-size are just gut-expanding, self-loathing, raid-your-fridge-at-night huge. Both dishes are loaded with toppings and flavorful. You won't really get \"tired\" eating either one.  My friend and I get a couple of tacos each and split the half-size fried rice normally. So filling that we have argue who has to get the last bite...

At the end of every meal, they come out with a nicely cut split orange as the perfect ending to all that heavy food. 

Out of the many times I've been here, they've gone through quite a few servers. For such a small place, sometimes they do neglect refilling my water, especially when it's super busy. But, on most of my visits, it's consistently attentive. 

Downside? Not open late nights (they close around 8pm daily) and they are closed on Mondays. Nobody likes mondays anyway.

This place is awesome. I'm not always wowed, but this place deserves five stars in my book. Will it blow you away like five stars might suggest? Probably not, but you can't beat the price, service, consistency, and the solid food."}
{"text":"I ordered the nachos with bulgogi, fusion enchilada and wontons.

Food-only ate here once but i love how they mix it up with korean and mexican dishes.  First timer and it was pretty good.  Nachos is awesome.

Ambiance-Felt good nice place to chillax and watch the game as well.

Customer service- on point! Super friendly and efficient.  Very helpful and patient.

Food 3 stars, customer sevice 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, awesome portions, great service and cheap prices. What more can one ask for?  Make sure you try anything fusion and try the wontons (tucked away on the back page) - they are homemade!"}
{"text":"I overheard my coworkers talking about this place and they were raving about it. I invited my husband to try it since we happened to be on that side of town and I'm so glad we checked it out! Yes, it's a small place and yes, it's a \"dive\", but the food is great and the service, even better. We've eaten there twice now and haven't had a bad experience. My personal favorite is the Bulgogi (Beef) Tostada. They use a crispy rice cake to host a slaw and meat. It's the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. I personally love their menu and will continue to dine there. I can't wait to check out their new location!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite joints in Vegas. This is our go to place when we're super hungry, because we can get amazing food for the price. Not once have we ever been disappointed. My favorite is the bulgogi fried rice and calamari tacos. They have a house salsa that is spot on with the Korean/Mexican fusion. I dump it on everything!"}
{"text":"7/28 came for lunch and bet the crowd. Had the fusion fries. Bulgogi topped fries. Good, meat was tender, it's a strange combo I'm used to carne fries so the sweet meat was not what I'm used too. Needs sour cream and guacamole . It was good. Not sure if I will order it again. Also ordered the pork belly musubi and that was so good and tasty my fave. Hubby ordered the tacoa chicken and pork. He liked the chicken the pork was too sweet. Love how they serve the hot sauce on little containers. Also that you not only get chips and salsa but guacamole too. Be prepared to wait, the sign says they make everything fresh so it takes awhile. Oh and they sell Mexican sodas too not only come but Pepsi etc."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Vegas. I fantasize about the fusion burrito with kimchi whenever I'm eating anything that isn't a fusion burrito with kimchi. Also the food quantity to cost ratio and flavor to cost ratio is more mind blowing than quantum mechanics. I just can't get my mind around it. But it doesn't matter, because every time I wrap my lips around a fusion burrito my mind instantly drifts away from rationality and enters an altered state of consciousness that consists of unadulterated bliss and euphoria. It's a profoundly addictive experience."}
{"text":"This place f-ing sucks balls! As soon as you walk in this place it reeks of mildew dirty water!! The floor plan is horrible, the food server is forgetful and is overwhelmed with work. Whatever you do don't eat here I could've had a V8! I had the bulgoli cheesesteak with fries and it had no flavor whatsoever! Fuck this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and the place was absolutely packed. It is a fairly small location, but certainly worth the wait. The hostess was friendly despite having to work a very busy floor.

I had the pork burrito and my friend had the 2 meat platter with rice. Food was much better than expected, hot and fresh. They also bring over a little sauce tray for you to try a variety of sauces on your food as you eat.

Overall, a very pleasant experience and judging from the line of customers waiting to get inside, well worth the wait.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were starved so I searched my bookmarks on Yelp and saw that we were near KoMex Express. It's a hole in the wall specializing in freshly prepared Korean Mexican dishes. Yes, Korean and Mexican. Marrying these bold flavors is a slam dunk of deliciousness.

We snacked on chips and salsa while we waited. Waits can be long because everything is made to order. The tasty guacamole will whet your appetite and you'll be eager to dig in when your order is up.

We had the Fusion Bulgogi Nachos and three tacos: pork, chicken, and beef with a side of stir fried kimchi. 

Neither of us are too familiar with Korean dishes. So, I can't vouch for how authentic these flavors are, but they are indeed tasty.

The Nachos were ginormous and better than most you'd find in Mexican restaurants. The chips are crisp and can easily support the sweet heat mountain of toppings. This is a feast. The only complaint is that we wished the cheese was thoroughly melted. 

The tacos were really great too. This visit the chicken had more flavor than the other two. I'm usually the biggest fan of pork so this was quite a surprise. The kimchi on the side was decent, but the weakest link. It just didn't pack the punch the tacos or the nachos did. 

These fusion bites are good eats. It's a nice find for when you're craving something a little out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Good food, good service = great atmosphere. Bulogi fries, spam musubi, taquitos, fusion tacos, mexican soda! yeah! Must try fried rice next time for sure! This is a 5/5 to go place whenever I'm in Vegas for sure!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall restaurant. Recently remodeled so it fits a lot more guests. Our favorites here are the Bulgogi burrito, tostadas and the tacos. The portions are huge and the prices are cheap!! They're always so welcoming and friendly, this is why we always come back when we crave fusion."}
{"text":"Stopped by, and this place was amazing. The portions were HUGE for a very reasonable price. Everything was solid. The Bulgogi tater tots are a must-try!"}
{"text":"At first I was extremely skeptical. But this place is a must try, definitely a hidden gem in Vegas."}
{"text":"My parents are usually very picky about trying new things. But I talked them into Komex knowing they usually like Mexican food and it worked out great. We ordered the tofu kimchi fried rice , chicken enchilada, veggie enchilada and a chicken torta. They end up liking the dishes so much they actually asked me to go back to get a menu because they're going to try ordering it on their own next time to try different things."}
{"text":"I went in the other day just to take a peek at the menu while I was waiting for my insurance agent. They offer a full menu at competitive prices. They made upgrades to the dining area since that last time I've been there. ( got rid of those seat pads) The house fried rice and boglie ( spell check) nachos are a must. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"We called in our order 15 minutes before we arrived. They had a table all ready for us with our food waiting. We ordered the bulgogi cheese steak, kimchee fried rice, and a half order of the bulgogi nachos. The sandwich was insanely delicious. The nachos were loaded with toppings and were excellent. The kimchee fried rice had a fried egg on top and were perfectly seasoned.  The chef and waitress were friendly and very accommodating.  This will definitely be one of my new weekly stops."}
{"text":"This place is simply clever. Taking the Korean world and fusing it together with the Mexican world, you get KoMex Fusion. Such a brilliant idea and the food does not disappoint the idea. My favorites is the Bulgolgi Nachos. It is very delicious and it gets me craving it just by talking about it. The best part about this restaurant is that the price is so reasonable and the portions are perfect. This is a very unique and delicious food experience!"}
{"text":"I love Komex!! Their food is incredible every time I have had it. I usually get it to go however if you dine there you get their awesome homemade chips with guacamole and salsa, which I end up ordering every time to go because they are that good! Super friendly staff with a very welcoming feeling. I love how items on their menu are custom to their regulars likes, and they have weekly specials which are always amazing! My favorite thing to get is their shrimp burrito...it's HUGE and you cannot beat the prices here at Komex! 

Love it!"}
{"text":"So delicious! I stumbled upon this place a few months ago on Yelp, and knew I had to try it. I dragged a friend in and instantly we were hooked. We were greeted with smiles and a large bowl of chips, salsa, AND guacamole. 

On my first visit I went straight Fusion Taco. One beef, one chicken, and one pork. The waitress asked if I wanted kimchi on top and I most certainly did. All three tacos were fabulous and for $1.29 each you can't really go wrong. My friend and I made the rookie mistake of each ordering three tacos and an order of Fusion Bulgogi Fries (everyone raved about them on yelp so we had to give them a shot). We were so stuffed after the three tacos that we barely made a dent in the fries, but they were great.

On my second visit I went with tofu fusion tacos and even tried one as a lettuce wrap. They were both great, but I forgot to ask for kimchi so not quite as tasty as the first visit. 

Visit komex with a big appetite and expect a bit of a wait if you're going at peak dinner/lunch hours. And, don't forget to request kimchi on your fusion tacos!"}
{"text":"I got the bulgogi cheesesteak. It was the most heavenly sandwich I've ever had the pleasure of shoveling into my mouth. It's a must have."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover. Not the prettiest place, but the food was outstanding!  Service was great. I ordered the tacos: shrimp, bulgogi, and carne asada. Excellent! My daughter (9 years old) ordered a burger and fries. It was tasty too. A new found gem!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype.  Reasonably priced Korean Mexican fusion.  The bulgogi enchiladas, Korean nachos, and Philly cheesesteak are great.  Service is good.  This is not a health food, arugula, anorexic chic restaurant.  This is a place for people who like food and are ok with the fact that eating involves calories."}
{"text":"This is my second trip. The first was with the family and this is a solo trip. The place is clean and the waitress is very friendly. I've tried an assortment of the tacos. All were very good. Saxby had the Korean style tater tot casserole. He loved it! The bulgogi bowl is great. Its basically bipmbap which i love. Today I'm having the bulgogi flautas. It's spicy Korean beef in fried rolled tacos. Delicious! Make sure you request the homemade salsas."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST PLACE WE ATE IN VEGAS!!

Reminded me of home.. maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much. Hawaii is known for the fusion of food and people and I found exactly that in Vegas! The food is soo ONO (delicious)!!! and for the price the proportions were generous.. I was going to pack the left overs for the plane ride home! 

We went with a party of 9 so we made reservations- we heard it gets busy for dinner. The place was filled when we got there so good thing we did. You need to try the bulgogi nachos, the tacos and fried rice!!! There are different types of meats that you can get so have your party order different ones so you can try them all!! Service was EXCELLENT, our waitress (the owner) was very attentive and the food came out fast!

Hope they open one in Hawaii!!"}
{"text":"Had another great meal here yesterday! 

I'm still in a phase of trying out different things here since everything has been really good thus far. We started with their yummy chips, guacamole, and salsa. 

It seems like I always start my meal off with 2 bulgogi tacos. This time around I also order their Fusion Chimichanga, also with bulgogi. The tacos are always great and never disappoint. The chimichanga was really good, covered with red enchilada sauce and some pico, spot on.  The ratio of meat to other ingredients was really good, never tasted too much of anything. 

Good tasting food at an awesome price, will be back."}
{"text":"Service is great, server was very attentive. Food was delicious. Tried the pork belly and shrimp tacos. Definitely recommend them"}
{"text":"Yummy! THis place doesn't have AC, so it got really hot, but loved their food!"}
{"text":"I tried this place and got caught up in the hype of the whole fusion thing. After the novelty wears off I realized how good Mexican food and Korean food is just by themselves.  Bring these together is just a good idea on paper. Let's put it this way the place is busy busy but no Mexican and no Korean customers. If you think kimchi is the only thing Korean food has to offer go to a bone fide eatery. It doesn't take a genius to replace ground beef in Mexican dishes with bulgogi and voila...fusion. Shortly they do both cuisines rather mediocre so the combination falls short of any greatness. The only saving grace is they give you a lot of food. If you're smart you'll catch on quick to the \"just add kimchi\" trick to every dish the owners had in mind. They have Mexican food in the back part of the menu as if an afterthought.  Go yelp Thai or Pho restaurants in the area If you have a craving for Asian food.  Want good authentic Mexican cuisine look elsewhere. If you just want to be curious and say you've been here then its your time and money to lose. Synergy has not been achieved. Experiment failed!"}
{"text":"One word, WOW !!! My friends and I were searching for a place to eat as we drove back from the Grand Canyon. We came across this place but it  was closing in 45 minutes so we rushed! When we got there the gentleman in the front quickly acknowledged us and found us seats!! He was soooooo nice!! ( I don't know if he was also the owner ) but seriously he was on top of things. We ordered our food and it came out so quickly !! The food was so yummy. All my friends enjoyed their meals!! The prices are verrrryyy reasonable as well! You get 5% off your check when you pay with cash! :)  I ordered the philly steak"}
{"text":"Less than ok food, good idea bad execution,   We order about 8 different plates, the only thing worth was the steak cheese sandwich thats why they get 2 stars, probably will not be back and do not recommend. Dry food, not enough of the main ingredients."}
{"text":"Like others, I'm glad there is an outpost of Komex farther west.  As it's new, the restaurant is bright and airy and seems to seat more than the original location.  We arrived around 5pm on a Friday and was seated immediately.

We had our standard order of kimchi fried rice, calamari tacos, a trio of tostadas, and fusion nachos.  This was enough for four adults with healthy appetites. The deep fried rice patties for the base of the tostadas were especially good this time - crispy yet light and chewy.  Out of the three available meats - beef, chicken, pork - the chicken is the least inspiring.  

Service is always prompt and friendly.  Water glasses always filled.

By the time we left around 6:30, the place was filling up fast.  Plentiful parking and not in  a sketchy neighborhood.  We'll be back soon and often!"}
{"text":"SO delicious!  I am still working my way around the menu, so I am not sure yet which is my favorite.  However, there hasn't been a single disappointment.  The bulgogi tacos, tostada and chimichanga were all fantastic and service has always been super-friendly.
I could be happy just with the free chips, salsa and guacamole and they always taste so fresh."}
{"text":"Little secret gem you need to know about. Located in a shopping center, it's small and usually crowded inside, but the food is inventive, delicious and very inexpensive. Try the fusion tacos or burrito. Stupid tasty.

Take a little work adventure there with co-workers, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"My family and i decided to try this place based on the rave reviews here on yelp. We fed a family of 4 for less than $40. That's the only real plus is the price. They do give you a lot of food too. The taste however was nothing to write home about.

I had the spicy pork and beef bulgogi with rice. Although it was sorta good it tasted sorta dry. My wife had their beef fusion burrito and said it was the best she ever had. 

This is a good family place because a lot of adults brought their kids there and they were just running around. For the first time ever I told my kids if they want to play around at a restaurant they can. If you're the type of person that likes nice quiet romantic settings don't go here. It's a family (with kids) restaurant.

3 things that bother me:
(1) when you walk in, even though you can sit immediately at a table because it's a really small place, they have a stupid sign asking you to wait to be seated. I'm sorry but the atmosphere of this place doesn't scream high class si why are you pretending to be high class by making us wait???

(2) They don't have fountain drinks. You have to order canned or bottled drinks and they charge a lot for them. Whatever savings you have from the food will be made up for with the cost of drinks. And it's not like you can get a free refill on drinks when they are canned/bottled

(3) The best and most surprising thing about this place is that they make their own homemade nachos and they taste great. You'll instantly want more but they only brought 1 little small basket for all 4 of us to share. The basket is so small you'd think they should bring 1 for each person or at least give us a much bigger bowl of chips (enough to feed 4)

With all that being said I would recommend someone to try this place but if you have to drive more than 10 mins to get to it then it's not really worth it. We drove all the way from Henderson so it was like a 20-30 minute drive and I didn't think it was worth that."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 items. 

Best thing to come out was the chips and salsa that were comp w the meal. Crispy and delicious but doable at home. 

Jim's Bulgogi Fried Rice - very large serving. Fried in sesame oil which I like. Very good but not necessarily unique or hard to find. 

Pork belly Fusion Taco - Disappointing. 
Pork belly = Meat and Fat
Hot pork belly fat is heaven on the roof of your mouth. After it cools and congeals a bit it heads south in taste and texture. That's how the fat part was in my taco. Had to spit out a few nuggets. 
The meat part was like marinated jerky bits. Very chewy though flavorful.  

Probably won't be back. Mainly because I'm from Hawaii and there are a lot of places I'd like to try in Vegas so you gotta hit hard on your first try for me to come back. 

Oh and there's nothing free w Yelp checkin."}
{"text":"Thanks fellow Yelpers!

This restaurant was FABULOUS!  I had a helluva time finding the place, since I'd never been in the neighborhood before and didn't think to remember the exact address.

Here's what I got for less than $7:
---  Complimentary chips, salsa, and guacamole(!)
---  Two fusion tacos - one beef and one pork.  Both with kimchi and their super hot sauce.  These had so much stuff on them that I had to eat them with a knife and fork.  I know, bad form on my part.  
---  One fish taco
---  A complimentary dessert - a sectioned orange with a toothpick.  Cute!
---  One can of Diet Coke

A portly (stout?) (rotund?) (pleasantly plump?) lady was sitting near me.  She ordered FOUR TACOS, stuffed her napkin down her shirt, picked up a taco, and WENT TO TOWN!!!  Sauce was running down both her arms and she was dropping some serious food.  It was a sight to behold.  

One of my friends (a fat guy) once told me, \"If you're a fat guy, the food never hits the ground first.\"   But I digress.

They need to charge more!  I told the Asian lady (the owner?) this when she brought my bill.

The space is small and it's out of the way for tourists like me.  But WOW, the food is OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Delish.  Jen got three fusion tacos (one each flavor, two on tortilla's & one lettuce wrapped).  I got the fusion nacho's (spicy pork) and the tostada with beef.  Wow.  Each bite more yum than the last.  Made fresh on a saturday night.  Not too busy either with great service.  With a couple drinks we stuffed ourselves for under $25.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here again yesterday (the first time was sometime last year) because my Bf had heard all the hype about this place but had never actually tried it. I personally didn't like it the first time I came, and the second visit was no different.. so it's safe to say that I probably won't be back.

We ordered the bulgogi nachos to start -- we both actually enjoyed this a lot. You can't really ever go wrong with nachos, but this really did have that extra pop of flavor that you don't get with normal nachos. Very unique. If I ever craved nachos, I'd probably come here.. but other than that.. eh. 

We should have stopped at the nachos though, because everything after that was very disappointing. Bf ordered the bulgogi burrito or something like that, and he finished half before putting it down and declaring \"wtf am I eating.\" I had ordered the calamari taco & spam musubi with fried egg.. The calamari taco tasted like a normal taco with 2 pieces of fried calamari smothered in their \"fusion\" sauce which really just tasted like big mac sauce/thousand island/gross. I couldn't even force myself to finish it.. and it was at that point that I was thankful I didn't order the bulgogi cheesesteak.. I am sure I would've been highly disappointed  as I AM from Philly..

Spam musubi was good.. messy to eat though :(

I like the whole concept of korean/mexican fusion, but I think I will just stick to one or the other for now. The prices are more than fair here, and the portions are huge.. but in the end I prefer quality to quantity."}
{"text":"Korean and Mexican WHATTTT??? Wow there is something to be said about Fusion Food. We stopped at this place when a friend jumped on Yelp and saw the fab reviews.  It is in a strip mall with tight parking but so worth the extra effort and time.  So inexpensive especially in a town where I am always shocked at the cost of Mexican Food. I had the fusion tacos and they were delish!

Love finding little gems like this.  It's a place worth driving to and checking out. You will not be disappointed. If you are picky on ambiance take it go.

Geez this review is making me want to take a trip back to KoMex as we speak : )

Did I mention just saw they opened another location on Flamingo/Buffalo woot woot!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place...best tacos I've ever had. I had the bulgogi tacos.The kimchi makes the tacos taste out of this world. We also had the chow fun...yummy. Free chips/Guacamole and bottled water. And it's super super cheap. Can feed a family for 20...can't even do fast food for that price. The staff is nice.. can't wait for them to open another store."}
{"text":"Yum!  Could be the new lunch spot for me and my husband.  He loves  Asian food and I love Mexican. They get it right. The perfect fusion of flavors. We had the Fusion tacos and Fusion Burrito. Both were excellent. We tried chicken and pork. Also had the won tons and the enchiladas. I still have 1/2 a burrito for lunch. WOW!!  Super huge and delicious burrito. We will be back. Also everyone that works there is super nice."}
{"text":"The Food is Amazaballz!!! Great price point, casual and you'll never leave disappointed. Staff is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"finally hit KoMex - not even close to my neighborhood, nor do i seem to have a reason to be in this area but i driven a heck of a lot farther for less quality food.

Tried the fusion tacos ( beef, chicken and pork - $5 includes a canned soda ) , beef fusion burrito and the beef fusion quesadilla.  All great but i give the Gold to the burrito - great stuff, reasonable prices - this place is worthy of expansion to the rest of the valley !"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout.  Service was fast and not a long wait at all.  Ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl, Fusion sliders with fries, and the Fusion Fries with bulgolgi and added avocado.  Overall, the food was just ok, based on the reviews I expected to be blown away, but really it was just ok.  Ive had really good Korean bbq so I was expecting a little more flavor, but it mightve been the dishes I ordered.  I'd definitely come back and try something different."}
{"text":"YUM! 

Sweet AND spicy, fast AND fresh.

Found this place after exploring Yelp. I WILL BE BACK!

Pros:
-even though it was crowded, we were seated in less than 5 minutes
-very friendly service
-NACHOS. get the NACHOS.
-complimentary chips and guacamole/salsa
-I love musubi and they had pork belly musubi on special. YUM YUM YUM!
-complimentary sliced orange dessert
-1/2 order of nachos & 1 order of musubi was PLENTY food for 2 people (our total bill was $13!)
-definitely ask for their hot sauces! (the sweet-ish one was my FAVE)

Cons:
-small-ish inside (but not too small)
-limited parking, even though it's a private lot.
-the blinds inside the restaurant were very dusty, which indicated to me that they need to do some thorough cleaning!"}
{"text":"What a great idea to fuse Korean and Mexican. The atmosphere is very relaxed, its looks kind of divish, but the food is so good. You cant go wrong with any of the tocos, I wish they would open one on the South side of town."}
{"text":"Saw a bunch of good reviews for this place & decided to try something different. This is kind of a \"hole in the wall\" spot on Decatur amid boring & bland restaurants & shops (except Pepe's!) so I wasn't expecting too much. But their menu & customer service were pleasantly surprising! 

Boyfriend got the fusion torta with pork belly (which was extra) & I got the fusion chimichanga with bulgogi. Yum! My chimichanga was topped with their \"Komex Slaw\" which had tons of flavor & made the dish IMO. (Boyfriend got a side of it & put it right in his sandwich. He says if you get the torta, this is a must) 

All in all, not a bad way to spend $20 & we'll definitely be coming back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward in trying this place. I have to say I was little disappointed in the the value. The tacos where priced well but the other items where a little pricey. They should spend some money on the decor and the sign in front of me reminding me that it's going to take longer should be not be blasted of front of me. I recommend a simple sign or simple verbal reminder. A quick cleaning goes a long way. But try the lettuce pork belly tacos.  The asian guy was not really happy to see us! A smile goes a long way:)"}
{"text":"KoMex was a great find, thanks Yelp! The food and service were both excellent. I thought going to someplace new I would go with the waiters suggestion on the items I was interested in.. good call.. Everything was so good!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Just finished my meal. Ordered the kimchee fried rice which already comes with an egg but I wanted it scrambled. When I got my bill they had charged me $1 for the egg. When I asked why, the manager said for labor. Never in my life have I experienced something so ridiculous as being charged $1 for a scrambled egg instead of a fried egg."}
{"text":"WOW. Amazing! We got takeout, bulgogi entree and bulgogi fries. I didn't realize I had been craving bulgogi until it was in my mouth, at which point I died from how delicious it was. Definitely going to try eating at their restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Love this place!! One of my favorites! Service is always great!

Food is delicious, a few of my favorites are: fusion torta with spicy pork, the pulled pork sliders, the bulgogi nachos and the kimchi fried rice. 

I can never get enough of Komex!!

PS: their homemade hot sauce is a must try!"}
{"text":"I have had few Korean Mexican mixes before, and I gotta say that they did a great job! 

We ordered Fusion burrito with beef and Fusion bulgogi fries with kimchi. They are both really delicious but that fries... it's a must. 

Service was wonderful, quick, and delightful. 

Overall, wonderful  place that's well deserving of your money."}
{"text":"My favorites here are the fish taco lettuce wraps, wings and bulgogi fries.  The fish tacos just taste so fresh and light.  The wings are fried crispy, juicy and tossed in slightly spicy kimchee sauce  The fries are piled high with cheese, pico and salsa and shredded bulgogi.  Service is always friendly and the latest time we went, the food came out really fast.  We could hear the wings drop into the fryer back in the kitchen.  This is a casual, low keyed neighborhood place with some really tasty food."}
{"text":"Great food might be an understatement, even better prices! Love Komex Fusion, only reason I gave it a 4star, is it could use some major scrubbing inside but if you are willing to look the cleanliness the rest is great."}
{"text":"One word describes this place. \"Amazing\". 
I always wanted to try this place out simply because I saw how much buzz there was about the place. I had to order take out because last time I tried eating here I was surprised by how packed the place was. The food was ready upon arriving, the joint itself is small but that is besides the point, it won't matter anymore once you've tried the food. The staff is definitely friendly and I saw a great variety of drinks in a fridge behind them. I was eager to eat it on the way home.

Finally, we (my dad and I) tried the Mongolian Beef and the Bulgogi Sliders. PERFECTION. The food was gone in an instant, I could not contain myself. There is so much flavor packed into their food that you are overwhelmed. Fanastic."}
{"text":"It's okay.  My family of 5 was really excited to try this place out, since the only place to get Korean-Mexican fusion is off a food truck in Houston.  I think we ordered half the menu.  All we can say about this place is...it's okay."}
{"text":"Good portion of food worth the price, but mediocre taste. Nothing's really special. Great if you're broke."}
{"text":"My Korean wife ordered a Korean dish and it was good. I had the enchiladas with Korean chicken inside. It was weird. Not sure the fusion thing works here, but the Korean food is up to snuff."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a new, yet familiar type of food.  The entrée portions generous, affordable and above all delicious.   We enjoyed the environment and will be back for more."}
{"text":"I should receive a free Gym membership with how much I eat here.

I absolutely LOVE the tofu lettuce wraps, vegetable chimichanga and french fries.

The first time I went to the North Decatur location I got a little lost. The place isn't easy to find but as I did a U turn, I saw a very long line out the door of a hole in the wall looking place, looked up and realized I was in the right place! I quickly pulled in, parked and waited in line. Despite the long line and how small the space is, the cashiers moved through each persons order rather quickly. When I got to the counter, I had asked them what their best vegetarian & vegan friendly dishes were and by was I surprised on how informed and genuinely friendly their staff was. It wasn't long before I placed my order. An extra spicy Korean vegan burrito, french fries and a drink. Needless to say, I fell in love and have been eating at KoMex ever since.

Now, I tend to frequent the Buffalo & Flamingo location simply because it's closer to where I live but don't worry, both locations are fantastic! Do not miss these hidden gems!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and I had to try it. There's taco trucks that are somewhat similar which I love so knew that I'd love this place. It's great that the tacos come with the option of a lettuce wrap. Had the bulgogi taco with lettuce wrap, pork belly taco with corn tortilla and the calamari taco with flour tortilla. All came with slaw. Kimchee was tasty too along with the chips, guacamole and salsa that was included. Hubby had the chimichanga which was huge!! He had to take half of it home. 
Would definitely go back. Have to try the taters, fries and won ton.  Would be interested in franchising this place for California. The website's link to franchise wasn't working. But, this place is a definite hit!"}
{"text":"Starts off you off with free unlimited chips that is served with guacamole and salsa.. Delicious! It is definitely worth the price of the tacos. I ordered the bulgogi, daegigogi, and the asada tacos. Definitely worth the price. Each taco was $1.29 and it was very delicious. After your meal they give you a half sliced orange as a dessert.   Their service was perfect, the food was excellent, and the price was incredibly low for what you get. I will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"The food was really good! I have been looking for a spot like this! A place that cooks the food when we order it and makes it like how they would eat it at home. The tots plate was delicious with the bulgogi rice plate. It a simple restaurant and chill atmosphere. If you want quality food it's here at a very good price!"}
{"text":"I'm gaga for their bulgogi!

As their name suggests, KoMex is a Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant with a little Chinese and American thrown in for good measure. This is truly a hidden gem; although it's only a few blocks from my house, it's located in a nondescript strip mall behind a gas station, and I didn't even know it was there until I looked for nearby restaurants on Yelp. Now it's one of our go-to places for takeout (which I heartily recommend; because of its small size, you might have to wait a bit to dine indoors).

I agree with other reviewers that their bulgogi fries are fantastic, but there's one menu combination that can't be beat: the beef chow fettuccine and pork-kimchi fried rice. We usually get a full order of the fettuccine and a half order of the rice, and the portions are so big that this will serve as two hearty meals for two hearty eaters.

The beef chow fettuccine combines their signature bulgogi beef with red cabbage, onions, peppers, and carrots, all served over thick noodles. Sounds weird, but it's the best thing on the menu (IMHO). We like the fried rice with pork -- although I think any meat would be fine -- but you HAVE to add the kimchi (and its traditional fried egg partner) to give it a little extra spice. I'm not a huge kimchi fan, but it works perfectly in this combination and is especially good when you mix the fried rice and the fettuccine together. DELISH!

This time we also each ordered a chicken lettuce wrap as an appetizer. Once again, any meat combo would do in this dish. We've tried the bulgogi and the pork belly before, but today chicken won out. Chopped chicken topped with cabbage and cilantro, all wrapped up in an iceberg lettuce leaf. You can also get these as tacos (corn or flour tortillas), but the lettuce was a refreshing change from our otherwise carb-heavy meal.

Takeout service is quick and efficient, and the counter help is always friendly and appreciative when we arrive. And you can't bet the price, especially for these huge portions: $23 for two great meals for two. Thanks to the food gods for putting KoMex so close to home!"}
{"text":"Bulgogi nachos, BBQ pulled pork sliders, and wontons.  Everything was so delicious, I can't wait to go back and try everything else.  Great service, great people, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Really not impressed with this place, the meat hardly tastes marinated & the service sucked.. Server never offered me a water & Its getting to the point I'm going to grab my own to go box!!!"}
{"text":"Yup, worth every star! Thank you fellow yelpers! The shrimp tacos- my fav!!!"}
{"text":"The place is small and tables are close together so be prepared to hear the conversation going on at the table beside you...other than that, and the lack of parking due to it being in a strip mall...the place is great!

The food was amazing.  Complimentary chips and guacamole (small portions size, but enough to hold you over until your food arrives). Of course the begogi fries are a must have and the fusion chimi is delicious.   The service was good, there is a board informing you that KoMex is NoT fast food so be prepared to wait a little while.  The wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall restaurant produces Korean-Mexican fusion delights that exude wonderful flavors. Everything is made fresh. The owners concern for quality comes through with every bite. 

The tables are very plain. There is nothing at all fancy. Don't let that stop you from going to KoMex - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa... Komex, where the heck have you been all my life? Ok, maybe it's a good thing you're 250+ miles away... or I'd need a triple bypass and a lifetime membership to the gym and Overeaters Anonymous. 

1/2 Nacho 1/2 Fries Combo. Talk about having your cake and eating it too. I couldn't decide between the Fushion Nachos or the Fusion Fries... but luckily this isn't a dilemma because I can order 1/2 of each. Komex, you're the real MVP!

Ok, seriously, who came this dish? According to my waistline, you are the devil. The nachos are the star. They're fresh outta the fryer - but not super oily at all (which is surprising.) The bulgogi, the cheese, the secret sauce... OMG. I'm drooling on my keyboard just thinking about it. Run 3 miles, come eat these nachos (and if you get the fries, request them WELL DONE), and then run another 13. It's worth it, trust me. 

Oh, I ordered some other stuff too - but who cares. Get the damn fusion nachos!"}
{"text":"Actually really disappointed by this place. I've gone to the location on Decatur which is really good . I made a order for pick up they got my order wrong. Which I understand can happen but when we went back my BF order a burrito it was half open and looked like they half ass's my food point is .  If your mad you got the order wrong don't just half ass a service you have to fix !"}
{"text":"I took my dad here for lunch, the restaurant was small but the food arrived quickly and the tacos were delicious"}
{"text":"I checked out this place because a friend of mine highly recommended it.  It's a Mexican restaurant served with Korean style meats, basically a fusion joint hence the name.

The food was ok, we sampled the bulgogi chimichanga, chicken quesadilla, and pork/spam kimchi fried rice.  Being from Hawaii, I've had my share of pretty awesome Korean food, Mexican not so much.  The fusion of styles actually works quite well, but I won't be going back.  Not because of the food...

...because of the service...so I walked in for the first time and was given a menu and told they would take my order when I was ready.  I politely chimed in that I was trying the place for the first on a very high recommendation of a friend and asked what they would suggest for my first time.  Apparently they didn't care much that they were recommended as I was abruptly told it was a Mexican restaurant served with Korean meats...yeah, I kind of knew that...then recommended I have what my friend had..Idk what they had, and was pretty turned off at that point...so yeah, long story short, wasn't worth the money paid, but it wasn't horrible...and if you're going to check it out for yourself, definitely look at the menu ahead of time and have an idea of what you want to order before going in."}
{"text":"Very good food loved the noodles and the service was outstanding.  The only knock is the outward appearance, a little strip mallish"}
{"text":"Only reason why this place did not get five stars is because of the drink options when you go inside the restaurant other than that the food was awesome and offered a different taste to Nacho's that I have never had in my life and their komex sauce is amazing my boyfriend really care for it but so what it's a girl's world right I know this won't be my last time coming here it does get crowded in the small parking lot so please be prepared for snug parking"}
{"text":"Great service from our waitress!!  Attentive and patient as we have 3 children who were in their words \"Starving!\"  Food was great and my boys were very surprised with the flavors. My 3 year old daughter was less patient with the delivery of her French fries which she thinks should have apparently been waiting for her before we even entered this restaurant...  lol. She cracks me up. I loved the kimchi fried rice with egg as did my wife for the bacon fried rice. Quesadillas were ordered with chicken and cheese only.  VERY GOOD.  My youngest son dared to get the bulgogi grilled cheese with fries and was ready to say his food wasn't good...  until he sank his teeth into this incredible sandwich. Somehow the silence of his voice showed the appreciation of the food he was enjoying (well actually inhaling) (wasn't a pleasant sound he was creating but a laughable one!). 

Eat here and you'll be satisfied with your choice!  PROMISE."}
{"text":"Holy crap. It took me forever to decide what I wanted to get because I wanted to order e v e r y t h i n g.  They have tacos. Breakfast food. Burgers. Bulgogi everything. Spam musubi with fried egg?! The list goes on. The portions are pretty hefty. I came with a friend and we ordered 2 things each but it could have fed 4.  We had lots of left overs! (Which I ate the next day and it STILL was bomb!). The only downfall is that most of the dishes seem too greasy. I felt a little gross from all the oil but it was so worth it and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"the komex tacos are delish and satisfy both korean and mexican cravings. my hubby was the biggest cynic of this kind of fusion cuisine but his opinion changed after his first visit and now we are regulars. lettuce wrap tacos are fresh and huge. we love the different sauces/salsas and my kids love the yummy tortilla chips and guacamole. the owners are super friendly and so hard working. it is a rarity to come here anymore and not expect a wait for a table. hole in the wall yumminess!"}
{"text":"If you like spicy hot get fusion menu. But if you like Korean go for the fried rice. Great fusion combinations. Will get toppings for fusion fries on the side."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years and it never disappoints!!! I normally get the bulgogi tostada which is on a crispy rice patty and a shrimp lettuce wrap."}
{"text":"omg this place is AWESOME!! really no words can describe how delicious this place is everything we ordered was mind blowing even the orange slices at the end of the meal is amazing! im for sure going to come back!!"}
{"text":"O KoMex, what a fantastic fusion feast 
from this oasis to my east.
Since I live on the west coast,
I do not mean to boast
but I wanted to explain my positioning in the least.

The fusion of cultures and foods were actually above par.
When mixing Bulgogi and Flautas, it was great and bazar.
But the place settings were were decorated with folklore from China,
which is something I'd expect in South Carolina;
I don't think they really know who they are.

Mexican, Korean, and a little Chinese,
with food so great it brought me to my knees.
Though I would be remiss if I forgot to mention their sauce,
it was their winning combination that made them so boss.
I will always accept your fusion guac with a thank you and please.

The wait staff was nice,
they accommodated our vegetarian not once, but twice.
Was it the greatest? I do not think so,
but I'd highly recommend that you all go.
This is one place in Vegas you won't need to roll the dice..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. A friend had raved about how awesome it was and it was just blah. Definitely nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"forget the casinos, come here first when you're visiting Vegas. 4 people, four full meals, $30.00! I LUV this place"}
{"text":"Wow who knew that combination of foods work deliciously"}
{"text":"Incredibly good food. I had the fusion enchiladas, all three meats. My daughter had the bulgogi tater skillet. My husband had the burrito fusion. All I can say is that this is definitely a place to eat while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved it! Small restaurant with friendly service there is a sign that ask for patience for food but the wait time was any normal restaurant wait. I would order the flautas, pork belly tacos, and the macaroon ice ream sandwiches again."}
{"text":"Complimentary chips/salsa. Food is about 7-12$ each. This is a great spot for hangover food. Greasy, fatty, filling food. 

Beef kimchi fried rice- the kimchi flavor is very loud. Not too spicy.

Spicy pork chimichanga- the spicy pork flavor stood out the most. It was my favorite meat here. 

Tater tots- crispy and full of love.

Waitress was very attentive for lunch hour, and the food came out fast"}
{"text":"Great service! Great delicious food! The Bulgogi Tater Tots, Korean style Buffalo Chicken Wings, and Bulgogi Flautas were awesome. Parking may be a challenge but we lucked out this time. Definitely will come back whenever when we are in the area!"}
{"text":"The FLAVORS!!!!  Seriously, this place puts every other place out in the dog house).  I recommend the kimchi burrito or the Mexican style veggie burrito.  The salsas are great.  My only gripe is the attitude of the hostesses.  Sometimes they are amazing, sometimes not.  So... I take a star.  I've had the cronut.  Pretty good, though not amazing for the price.  The bulgogi fries are good, but the cheese sticks to the paper they line the Styrofoam with and you miss out on hella cheese (unless you like cheese paper like me, but it's no fun)."}
{"text":"Honestly I've never had ANYTHING like this back home in Southern California  I had the fusion tater tots and it was super yummy and the bulgogi was really good too. My boyfriend had half and half fusion fries and nachos and those were really delicious as well. My hometown in Orange County really needs to step it's fusion game up!"}
{"text":"Just amazing! I have never experienced a better fusion than Korean Mexican food. I absolutely love this place! I go here on every trip to Vegas! The Fusion Nacho's are incredible! I have had every Fusion item on the menu! Everyone is worth trying! My favorite is the lettuce wrap because I can eat healthy while at the same time eat something amazing! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place was so delicious. Every single bite was an intense explosion of flavor. 

I ordered the wings, bulgogi chimichanga and kimchi fried rice. I loved them all. The portions were huge so we had plenty of leftovers for dinner. 

If I had to choose one, it would be the Bulgogi chimichanga. I can't even begin to describe the flavor but it's bulgogi in a burrito style chimichanga that is just so perfectly created. It's massive in proportion so you can share it with a couple of people. 

Will definitely return here."}
{"text":"Even though I'm Korean, my BF has a bigger love for Korean food than I do. (And he's Vietnamese)

With that being said, he literally woke me up from my post-drunken slumber to eat some Korean/Mexican fusion for lunch. At first, I was really dreading the drive to god knows where just to eat some lunch when I could have just ordered room service and or just make the trip downstairs. But nooooo, the BF HAD to eat here for lunch!

I was kind of in a grumpy mood by the time we arrived here because we drove a good 10 minutes outside the strip to some little hole in the wall joint.  Normally, I don't mind a good hole in the wall but I think I was still drunk and super hung over. The owners are Korean and they are very kind. They're English is very fluent but I still decided to speak to them in Korean which they really appreciated and liked. They moved fast which I really liked and the owner moves in the speed of light cleaning the tables, taking orders, and delivering food. Pretty good service!

We received the menu and we ordered the musubis, tacos, and bulgogi fries. OMG. When the bulgogi fries arrived, I was in awe.  There was SO much stuff on it I just didn't even know where to begin. I dug right in and the flavors were very good! Surprisingly good! I really liked the mix of bulgogi, kimchi, jalapenos, and the fries.  It was a first for me actually to eat bulgogi fries! I've had carne asada fries and adoba fries but no bulgogi fries! Supeerrrr good! A must get if you come!

The tacos and musubis were also delicious! The restaurant does a great job of keeping the authentic Korean flavor while putting the Mexican twist using the typical Korean ingredients. I really enjoyed eating here for lunch.  My grumpiness quickly turned into happiness because I got myself a bomb.com lunch. (:"}
{"text":"Being of Korean heritage with a mom who can COOK, I have insanely high standards for Korean food (especially for daeji gogi and bulgogi).  That being said, even considering my insane standards, the food at KoMex was quite good.  

Food: 4 stars - Nothing is ever quite as good as mom's cooking but this place came pretty close.  I had the daeji gogi burrito and it was very yummy.  My husband ordered the chicken gogi burrito, which wasn't quite up to the par of the daeji gogi burrito but it was decent.  The real reason why the food only receives 4 stars is because the bulgogi nachos we ordered were somewhat of a disappointment.  Maybe my standards are a little too high but it was a little skimpy on the toppings and the bulgogi itself was lacking something.

Value: 5 stars - Considering that this place is in the insanely expensive city of Las Vegas, this place was a fabulous value!  Add the ginormous portions and honestly, the value for the quality and amount of food you get cannot be beaten.

Service: 4.5 stars - The service was good-ish.  Nothing to write home about but they did give us two free mini bottles of Sam's Club water so I gave them an extra star :)

To sum it up: If you are in the Vegas area and are looking for a great meal, give this place a try.  If you are a value oriented person who is looking for a great meal at a very reasonable price, this place is a must."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews about this place, we had to come here with our rental car on our Vegas trip... and I'm so glad we did!

I got the daeji-gogi (bulgogi-style pork) burrito with kimchi, and boyfriend got the same but with classic bulgogi. We also shared some fried beef and pork-stuffed wontons (4 small ones for $1!) and complimentary chips, salsa, and guacamole.

I preferred the beef, but both burritos were OUT OF THIS WORLD and we were only able to finish about half each. (We happily saved them in foil and had them as a pre-airport snack later that afternoon.) The service was super friendly, personal, and fast. It had a very family-owned feel, and the menu noted the favorite dishes of their most frequent regulars. I so wish we had something like this in my hometown!"}
{"text":"Food-average.  My bff and i ate the tacos. Bulgogi, pork, chicken, and the calamari. The bulgogi was decent. The pork and chicken ehh. And the calamari honestly couldnt tell if it was calamari or fusion of a calamari and fish pate. The prices are great tho.  We also had the kimchi fried rice. It was extremely oily and honestly didnt taste the kimchi. It was more like rice with a spicy red sauce of mystery. Maybe ill give the N. Decatur one a try.  

As for customer service. I hate waving to the waiter for the check when theres only a few tables that were occupied."}
{"text":"I love this Korean Mexican fusion food. When you get here you have to get the bulgogi tater tots. I also get the bulgogi chimichanga!! So good!! Service is great and clean bathrooms. I would come back over and over again. I also got kimchi fried rice and is was bomb!!"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving...don't judge a book by its cover...this place looks shady but the food was excellent!

The interior is very low key. I mean it's simply tables and chairs. It's clean and I like that! 

The service was very good. Our waitress was nice and knowledgable. She gave recommendations and I was pleased with the food. 

We ordered bulgogi nachos which were amazing. They had a Korean sauce that had a perfect kick to it. The meat was tender. This dish was on point. 

We also had the flautas which were fried just right. The guacamole to dip it in was great. We tried a pork belly fusion taco as well...eh. I've had better but it was tasty. 

The meal came with complementary chips and salsa. Chips were hot and fried! 

Will return to have the nachos but want to try the other location!"}
{"text":"Say MexKo
When I was a kid I saw this commercial where someone carrying a piece of chocolate fell into someone holding peanut butter, and peanut butter cups were discovered! Now, that's fusion! I don't know who fell into who here but mixing  Korean and Mexican did not have the same effect as the peanut butter cups for me. And don't get me wrong the food wasn't bad but I would rather have either Korean or Mexican, but not mixed, which they also serve. I did like the chips the salsa and the guacamole they were very tasty, and I would stop here just for that.
Service was very good, very friendly and attentive. The place is small but kept clean. Oh! And the Korean lady taking my order and asking me how I wanted the food made, in Spanish! Now that's a bonus star! (Review went from three to four.)
 I will probably stop again  and try other items, Mexican or Korean but not mixed. For now, I'll just stick to my own Korean, Mexican fusion..... me and my Hyundai."}
{"text":"Update on my 2nd trip to Komex.......better than the first time if that's even possible.  Tried the  PBBBLT (Pork Belly, Bulgogi, Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato) sandwich this time and it was the heat!.  
They also had a special (that I pray becomes a regular) on the menu......Pork Belly skewers!  Talk about melt in your mouth goodness!  I could eat this stuff every day.  This is one of those kind of things that could be pulled into a dozen different other dishes.

Don't waste time.......go now!"}
{"text":"Place is quiet by the time we went here, ( my kids and i ) their food was okay for the price we paid, service was good, there is only one girl working at that time and its already dinner time and they were starting to get busy, thats the only thing i have really noticed for a negative scenario that day. But all in all they're fine."}
{"text":"KoMex' fusion dishes are a little bit of a head scratcher. From what we ordered, they seemed largely like Mexican dishes with very little Korean going on outside Kimchi. The food was all solid, with the pork belly and fish tacos being the two standouts, but I was expecting more fusion and creativity going on. KoMex is very good quick (Don't call it fast!) food at cheap prices, in a bare bones setting, and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you love Mexican food, you'll love it here, homemade chips, crisp withe salsa and guacamole great. Chimichanga huge. Pork belly Tacos good, offered with 4 different sauces to spice it up 2 Korean, 2 Mexican. Employees very friendly."}
{"text":"Korean/Mex fusion is not a new thing. But this place has got the recipe down. I came with Angela and we both ordered some bulgogi tacos and shared the nachos.

The nachos hands down is amazing. Really amazing. You can absolutely come here and just order this as your only meal. Or, get some bulgogi tacos. Yeah they're good. Not the best I've ever had. Wish they made their own tortillas but almost no does in the States. But you get a ton of food on one taco.

Oh yeah, take a look at the pic I took. Its unique, I was amazed that no one else has taken this pic and posted it. It's not food, it's the sign about KoMex not being fast food. Seriously, this sign says it all. I think out of principle, I'd eat and support any place that has an equivalent sign."}
{"text":"DELISH!! This place has tons of great reviews for a reason. I live down the street from here and come here pretty often. I've almost tried there whole menu and I have yet to be disappointed. This place is a must try!!! If your a first timer and your a little skeptical, just start of with some of their fusion tacos and venture off from there. Enjoy :))"}
{"text":"Good menu, original flavor, great service! Very reasonably priced, large portions and pleasant staff. We eat here often and recommend you try it out!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu.  Definitely something neat.  I think it got a bit built up from what I heard.  It's really between and a 3 and a 4 star for me, but I think the uniqueness of the place and the pretty good prices give it a 4 star.  I'm interested in trying some other food from here and see what else I may like."}
{"text":"I'm so appalled that it took me this long to try this place but whew, finally! I love the concept, of course. The menu is not extremely extensive to the point where you get so confused on what to get. I opted for a simple Bulgogi & white rice because I was craving it but I also got to try their Bulgogi Chimichanga and Kimchi Fried Rice.

Nom! Everything was so tasty and unique. I really enjoyed my meal. Our server was extremely friendly as well. Tried to get the Fries to-go but she mentioned how it might be too soggy so she suggested the Nachos. Based on my cousins devouring it in minutes, I'd say the Nachos were delicious.

Can't wait to go back & try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I kept hearing how this place was so great and what not, so I decided to give it a try finally. As soon as you sit down they bring over chips and salsa to your table. The salsa was tasty the only thing is I wish they would give a bigger portion of it to have sufficient for all the chips. But then again maybe that's just me I just love chips and salsa. I ended up going with the fusion tacos, I ordered one pork belly, one calamari, and one one shrimp taco to taste a little bit of everything as this was my first time here. The shrimp tacos were okay, the pork belly tacos were good I would order them again, and the calamari tacos were my favorite of all! They were so good I wished I had ordered all three of them as calamari! They also provide four different sauces for the tacos a salsa roja, a salsa verde, a Korean sauce that has sriracha in it I believe, and this sweet/spicy sauce which was my choice for my tacos. The sweetness of the sauce definitely topped off the flavors in my calamari taco. I also didn't expect the tacos to be as big as they were, it was difficult to finish the third one as they are not only big they were also stuffed quite a bit with the cole slaw and pico. I'm not a fan of corn tortillas so I substituted mine with flour tortillas. Tacos just taste better with flour tortillas in my opinion. All in all I am now a Komex fan and will definitely be back to try bulgogi next!"}
{"text":"A pretty decent spot overall, IMO, this spot deserves about a 3.5 stars. I liked the food here, but wasn't completely sold on it for what it's worth.

This is a much bigger spot than the original location, and it also has a bar that you can sit down and order drinks, unlike the original location. After trying the food at both locations, I can say that for a fact that the food is exactly the same.

After sitting down, the server asked us for our drinks. I have to say, the service here is pretty good, even though they could have used more than one server. Our complimentary chips and dip then came out. So, I've never been a fan of flour tortilla chips, which is what they use here. But to each his/her own. The salsa was slightly better than the guac, but both were pretty weak. The guac could have used more acid and seasoning, and I wasn't big on the tomatoes they used for their salsa.

Fusion fries/nachos - I've tried both versions. In the end, it's just OK. The fries weren't as crispy as I would have liked, they became soggy rather quickly. Besides having the bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi, and kimchi as toppings, the rest itself is pretty plain.. Something that you could get at any video poker bar.

On a brighter note, I had a bite of my friends' spicy pork quesadilla and it was good, except being just a tad too sweet. The portions here are great considering the value.

For the fusion part, they take Korean ingredients and incorporate them into Mexican dishes. This is just my opinion, but I would like to see it the other way around as well. For example, they can make a carne asada/al pastor/ or carnitas fried rice or chow fun. It's just a thought. It's their business and they can run it as they deem fit. They seem pretty successful with their own formula, but I think that would be pretty cool to see, even just as a special. 

I thought the food was ok here. Some of my friends are fanatics about this place, and I wouldn't mind tagging along with them if they were in the mood. But, I can't see myself stopping in by my own accord."}
{"text":"YELP! WHY WONT YOU LET ME DO MORE THAN FIVE STARS?! This place is amazing! I can't believe I had never heard of it until today. Korean and Mexican fusion is literally the best combo and there just aren't enough spots around town. This place is top notch. Service was great, and food was absolutely DELICIOUS. I have to go back and try everything on the menu. Their bulgogi is perfectly marinated and tender. Food comes out fast and leaves you feeling too full to move. I definitely have a new fav in town.."}
{"text":"BOMB BOMB BOMB!  KoMex Fusion nacho fries are amazing!  Also had the enchiladas, SUPER!  This is one of my favorite spots to eat, GREAT food, service and very affordable!  You have to try it!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Every trip I take to vegas I have to stop by here.. Its truly amazing!  Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Can you share perfection in food! This is a wow moment and a must visit place when you come to Las Vegas. Away from the busses and hustle of the strip is this place. I like it so much and I forgot to take the pic of the Torta and tacos until I finish."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with this fusion offering in Vegas. Portions are generous and well thought out. I had a lettuce wrap taco with pork and a chicken taco with flour tortilla. Super yum."}
{"text":"Komex is fantastic!  Went for the bulgogi nachos which were great.  But, the fusion tostada with the pork was amazing.  The shell is rice just crispy fried on the outside with the meat and this asian slaw on the top.  The server recommnded the pork as the meat.  My husband got one bite of this and one bite only.  The three tacos with each of the three meats is a good way to go to taste them each.  The guys next to us got the bulgogi fries which also looked and smelled great, but I am a nachos girl.  We went at lunch and it was quite busy, but we got a table and the service was friendly, quick.  Delicious! ...  that sums it up."}
{"text":"Great food & Great Service! I found this place from Yelp over a year ago when I wanted something different but close distance to where I was. I love the fusion menu. This style of food is not something I was used to or ever had before.. but I'm happy I tried it... now this place is a family fav... we eat from here regularly."}
{"text":"My mom and dad were visiting me in Vegas and saw this place on the Travel Channel. We came in around 6pm on a Thursday- not too busy. Staff was SUPER friendly and funny. He helped us with the order to give us a great variety. Even explained the history of the joint to us. 

The food was complex. Eating a burrito or taco and tasting the tang & spice of Asian cuisine was intense . Easily could eat this every day. The komex salsa has a nice hot spice to it but can be easily added to top every dish. 

Highly recommend ."}
{"text":"I just can't tell you how much delicious Korean/Mexican fusion food they have. I love the various fusion tacos. You just can't have one. I've been going here for quite some time now and it has never disappoint me in any way. It does get busy sometimes and you might have to wait for a few minutes because they have about 20-30 seats for people. It's small in there but the food is worth the wait. Customer service is very good. I love trying new fusion food. This is must try place for locals and tourist."}
{"text":"KOMEX! WOW! nuff said.
1. Cheap! 
2. Huge portions.  
C. Friendly staff
IV. Delicious.

Definitely lived up to the reviews on Yelp!  Go with the fusion offerings before anything else on your first visit.  The Bulgogi (beef) taco's are cheap and amazing.  I down like 3 of these on each visit.
Free chips, Salsa, and Guac. start the meal.
We usually do one dish with the tacos.  The kimchi fried rice is delicious and HUGE, with a fried egg on top. Especially after 2-3 taco's you'll definitely have leftovers. The Mongolian beef is also worth a try.

Decor needs updating as it looks old and a bit run-down on the inside..but i guess with the type of reviews they've been getting and since the food speaks for itself, I'm sure the owners could care less.

The only way to describe this place is truly with the corny albeit often used phrases: 
**HIDDEN GEM** **MUST TRY** **FOODGASM** **GO-TO SPOT**

But i wouldn't write those words if they weren't true about Komex."}
{"text":"I was in the area around lunch time so I yelped a restaurant and this one seemed to get pretty good reviews. 
The interior looks a little dingy so I expected that I would have to order at the counter, but it turned out to be a sit down restaurant. They give you chips, salsa and guacamole when you first sit down. I had the half order bogogi chicken plate with rice, and it was GREAT! The portion was the perfect and really filling. 
The service was also really good. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delightful. Very interesting large & diverse menu that pleased my whole family, from the finicky 7 year old (he gives KoMex \"10 stars! \"), to the grumpy teenager (\"ugh\") to the very selective wifey, who liked how clean it is despite being not new, she liked that the entire menu could be made vegetarian (tofu or veggies), she liked the hustle & competence of our waiter/host, and she liked how everybody really liked their food.

I loved all of the above, plus that I could feed my whole family of six for about $40, or about $6.50 each.

They also had half orders of everything, perfect for my 7 & 10 year old.

Without asking our host noticed that we'd not finished our plates and he brought over takeout clamshells & bags. On the ball! 

Bonus Trivia: their \"tap water\" is in fact bottled water. The \"tap water\" they serve at your table in a large clear carafe is bottled. The water they use to rinse & cook the rice is bottled. The water they use to cook everything is bottled, at the insistence of the owner. My wife noticed that this made everything taste \"fresh\".

I liked that everything we ordered was more Mex, with a hint of Korean, yet I'm sure if you wanted a spicier Korean fare they would oblige, in fact Kimchee is on the menu. For example, my son's fusion nachos looked like awesome macho nachos, but the meat was marinated in Korean spices.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wowooo they mix Koren and Mexican cuisine and let me tell I never tested food so bad.i ordered chicken chow mein- the easiest dish to make and even on cheap Chinese restaurant it taste good! 
But this is was horrible !!!! Taste like they made it 5 days ago and keep reheated that. The chicken was full of unknown bones/fat/ cartilage! 
AVOID THIS PLACE EVEN IF ITS $6 for a dish!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so DANG GOOD!!!
One of the main things I love about this place is that they're consistent in the flavor.  
If you go, TRY THE BEEF!!! Take my word for it."}
{"text":"This place is so DANG GOOD!!!

I've tried both locations and they're always on point. Love it."}
{"text":"Woah, this place was truly amazing.  Prior to visiting here, I never realized Korean and Mexican could fusion so well.  I actually did set my GPS to here driving down from Salt Lake City, and they are just located a bit northwest from the Strip.  The interior felt just like a Korean restaurant.  The place seems packed all the time even though we arrived during late lunch hours.

The chips with guacamole shredded off the Korean feel immediately.  We decided on Kimchi Beef Fried Rice and Spicy Pork Chimichanga per other yelpers recommendations.  The rice was absolutely delicious, all the ingredients worked very well together, and even my wife who is a picky rice eater could not stop eating it.  The chimichanga probably bridged the Pacific very well with dega bulgogi inside a fried burrito.  Their mango passion fruit ice tea was decent.

KoMex was truly amazing, it is definitely high on my must visit places when I am in Vegas.  We really wanted to order more things, but our stomachs reached its limited.  It seems like they are opening another location in Spring Valley area."}
{"text":"Went in on a thurs afternoon. Not very busy. Awesome tacos. Got Pork belly, beef  and fish. All were top notch. I cannot speak to the other menu items. Good place for kids, locally owned and tacos are fresh, cheap and taste awesome. 

Highly recommend if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Quick and professional. My sister ordered the Kimchi chicken fried rice. Delicious. I ordered the enchilada plate with the choice of bulgogi. I know it wasn't the best choice. The food here is great tho. Korean mix with Mexican food. Unique food. A place to definitely try. All you need is 5 on ittt"}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a local Las Vegan, and it was so great! We are in town for just a week and looking for stuff to do off the strip that's more Las Vegas local style and less expensive. This place was a great find!

The food came out so quick! Salsa chips and guacamole were included free. Got the special and it was so great and made so quickly but high quality. 

Definitely recommend if you are in the area, looking for a quick, delicious and cheap bite"}
{"text":"You can't always trust Yelp...KoMex Fusion was such a disappointment. I stayed at the Bellagio and paid 70 bucks round trip to get here too (yes, call me crazy). Everything was so greasy! The bulgogi fries barely had any bulgogi. The food didn't sit well in my stomach either. What a letdown."}
{"text":"Still 5 stars! Just went there again and it is still delicious! We ordered bulgogi tacos on floor tortillas, the chicken Chow Fettuccine (1/2 order), and the bulgogi fries (1/2 order).  This was my first time getting the Chow Fettuccine, it was delicious!   We spent like $17.

The place was busy (it usually is).  We were lucky and got seated right away, but the wait for the food was pretty long.  We finished off the first basket of chips and salsa and guacamole. So they brought us a second basket, but I think they noticed with enjoy the guacamole, because they gave us to little cups of guacamole instead of just one. 

There was a couple next to us and the girl was there for the first time. It was very funny because she ordered fried rice, wings, some shrimp dish, and one other item I can't remember. Anyways each time they brought a dish she was shocked at the size.  She couldn't believe the portion sizes. Then when she was try the dish she was shocked again at how delicious they all were! I was very entertaining to watch her enjoy the experience for the first time.

Still great food, great staff, and good times! We posted pictures on our instagram and all our friends and family want to try it when they are in town."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's okay. Service is super slow. Nothing stood out in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great prices with very unique and tasty grub! So good! Totally originality! You have to stop here!"}
{"text":"Great business name and even better food! Best Kimchi fries I've had so far. The owner is very nice. Look at all the other pictures posted, everything looks amazing, it's the reason we went."}
{"text":"We made it - Visit #3-  I crave this place!  I live in Southern California, but traveled to Vegas to celebrate my birthday  for 3 days.  KoMex was on my list of places to eat.. OMG, I ordered the pork belly taco wrapped in lettuce and the bulgogi taco.. Delicious!  The spicy salsa is a must try.  I could probably drink this stuff it's so good!  The chicken wings are flavorful.  Kinda sweet, not spicy, but very tasty.  I topped them with some spicy salsa.  KoMex has changed their menu, but the favorites are still on it.  Also, they now close at 4pm on Sundays.. We barely made it."}
{"text":"Hmm.... How should I describe this place. 
EPIC!!!! I wish I could end here, but I want to give this place a five star. So, I must continue on and re-stating what other 650 people have already mentioned. Because my review gets added as a tip, not a review.

I love the fresh salsa made from scratch with a hint of Korean flavor. Its like J-Lo marrying Psy!! No, I am just kidding. All of the food I ordered here were fresh and superb and packed with fresh veggies and flavor! Very good price with fast friendly servers!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Clean and quick service. It's a place I will take friends and family when they visit me in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little spot that never fails to deliver. Great service and awesome food. The owner is hard working and passionate while back their fixing every dish fresh. Nothing warm or tasteless about this place. A must try resturant with reasonable prices and fusion menu that's right on!!!"}
{"text":"I love the bulgogi fries! yum yum yum.I also tried the burrito and its good. This is a great place to enjoy korean and mexican food."}
{"text":"Compared to the KorMex Fusion restaurant Vatos Tacos in SOUTH KOREA, I came here with high expectations after falling in love with Korean Mexican fusion food.
However, KoMex here in Las Vegas did NOT live up to its potential. 

The areas I rated that lead me to the 3 Star rating was first the food, the menu selection and the ambiance of the restaurant. 

The food was a hard 3 stars.
The bulgogi fries were made with what looked and tasted like Grocery Store frozen thick cut fries then topped with block cheese that just hardened if not eaten right away when hot. 
The Kimchi Fried rice tastes good at first but quickly looses its appeal after about four bites leaving you with a bland plain taste that makes you wish there was something to smack your taste buds out of your mouth. 
I ordered the Fusion Chimichanga which was a disaster. Waaaay too much vegetables on top of the mess and little flavor on the inside to keep you going for more. 

With dishes that were presented to look good the flavor was subpar. But it was ok if it's your first time trying Korean Mexican fusion however I will say this is MORE MEXICAN than Korean. 

The menu selection is basically a Mexican food menu with Bulgogi and other Korean meats to choose from. 
And compared to Vatos Tacos in South Korea where the restaurant shows elegance as well as style and class right when you walk in the door inviting you to not only come back for dinner but also bring a date, this KoMex restaurant seemed like the place you take your 4 person family or group to when you honestly just don't want Taco Bell and want to \"spice\" your lunch up for the day. 

Solid 3 stars. Would have given it 2.5 but I don't know how to do that on yelp."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was the fact that I had high expectations, but this place was just OK for me. It could also be the fact that I had tried much better Korean style burritos in Los Angeles. Being Korean, I have to hold Korean BBQ meat to that standard. The meat was good, but some of the mixtures of flavors didn't do it for me.

The bulgogi burrito was pretty good. I had trouble with the taste of the bulgogi and the taste of Spanish rice. The fried kimchi helped the taste. The pork was good, but I had trouble stomaching the calamari taco that was their special that day. Although it sounded like a good idea, it was just way too bland. I think the lime (or maybe it was lemon) and the sauce was the only thing that saved the taco, but even still I didn't find anything to rave about.

The price was so cheap. Based on how full my friend were, a $15-16 bill for two people is definitely not bad at all.

The idea of the Korean and Mexican food is appealing, but some of the food just didn't complement each other for my own taste."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Tried this with a friend since it sounded so unique and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the flautas and I will definitely get them again. The staff was so friendly. Must try."}
{"text":"Been going here forever, always order the same thing--veggie burrito with quac,, onions, beans rice, blah, blah. I come here so often (it's in my hood and it's my go-to cuz it's super consistent) that the owner said \"just call it the Rose burrito\" so I do, saves me time telling him what I want in it. Weather is good or bad, life is up or down, the owner answers and my burrito is there waiting for me 15 minutes later."}
{"text":"Loved the idea to combine these two types of food!  Bulgogi on nachos and burritos? Genius!  Taste was pretty good and had a great hole in the wall feel."}
{"text":"What.  Are Vegas Yelpers so used to crappy restaurants, this one seems terrific in comparison?  

My H and I landed at North Las Vegas airport at about 2:00 PM and were real hungry and thirsty, so we Yelped something nearby. Wow 4.5 stars so we made a bee-line to KoMex. 

One thing that attracted us to KoMex was, a Yelper wrote that you get chips and salsa. Not so fast, turbo.  You get your chips AFTER you order. So if it takes them a while to take your order, too bad, you get to wait. 

After I ordered my Bulgogi Plate and Gary his Chimichanga, our chips and salsa arrived with tiny plastic cups of salsa and guacamole.  The chips are more like fried wonton. Fine, ok but no big deal. 

I ordered iced tea and Gary ordered a Diet Pepsi. My tea arrived with no offer of sweeteners.  I dug into mu purse stash of sweet n low. Gary's drink was in a bottle. Really?  No fountain?  Sigh. I hate that. Did you guys know that fountain formula is different from bottle?  Very different. Bottle is full of phosphoric acid. 

Our food was fine. My spicy pork Bulgogi was not unlike I've had in other Korean restaurants. Gary liked his chimichanga and ate it all, but he didn't do two huzzas and a backflip. 

I had to ask for refills. The place is a little grungy and painted a mint-bile green.  An employee sat behind the service area eating a cucumber like a banana. The benches are wood but their backs are upholstered. The floor is dirty. 

I'd go back but overall, I'd say KoMex is only OK."}
{"text":"Everything from Komex is tasty! 
I've had their bulgogi burrito, their tostada, fish taco, bulgogi nachos and man oh man. 

I have yet to try something I don't like. They really have a unique flavor and idea goin on here. 

One of my usual items I order is the chicken tostada. It consists of stir fry veggies with an additional (optional) kimchi, and the \"tostada\" part is like a crispy rice patty. 

I think my fave part is that \"crispy rice patty.\" 

This place has one of the best kimchi I've had, so you know it's authentic. 

So with the unique idea, the flavors, and delicious kimchi, I rate this place a 4. I've come back numerous times when I crave for Komex; even since it is out the way for me."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. I first tried this for an event held at UNLV and the food is so delicious. My favorite were the flautas and the spicy sauce that comes with it. Korean/ Mexican food is so good and I will be back to this location to try more of their food."}
{"text":"First time at KoMex today! We got our food to go, about a 15 minute wait (hot as HELL in there!) but worth every minute!

It's very hard to find good vegetarian food, and this place surpasses all expectations! 

Tofu tacos with kimchi - DELICIOUS! The tofu is expertly cooked (nice sear but pillowy center) and flavored well. The Komex slaw is tangy and delicious and they have the best kimchi I've had!

Fries - I also got the bulgogi fries but omitted the meat! The fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Delicious cheese and I could drink the Korean hot sauce! This will be a staple! 

Beef Bulgogi Chimichanga - Husband got this one! He said the meat was flavorful, tender and plentiful! The Mexican rice was perfectly cooked and it had just the right amount of slaw and sauces!

Chow Chow with Shrimp - He states it's a fine dish and the shrimp were great but it lacked the flavor other dishes had. 

Wontons - Husband says these are a MUST have! The meat is amazing and the sweet chili sauce is fantastic. Easily worth three times the price! 

We will absolutely be back and I can't wait to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to really like this place.  Alas, it's just average.  I ordered the shrimp tacos, fish tacos, kimchee fried rice with shrimp, and nachos.  It was all fair.  The rice had a nice egg on top and tasted reminiscent of kimchee, but the shrimp (for which I paid extra) were non-existent.  Also, it lacked flavor and the rice was flabby.  When I think of Korean food, never does flabby rice darken my thoughts...

The tacos were pretty good, although the tortilla was too thick for my liking.  The nachos were good, but forgettable.  Also the area of town, and specifically the parking lot, are nightmares.  

So I likely won't go back, but OTOH I wouldn't speak ill of the place either if someone suggested going...."}
{"text":"I love the idea of Korean-Mexican fusion.  But, I don't know if we went there on a bad day, or they paid Guy Fieri a ton to hawk their place, but I wasn't impressed.  I ordered the bulgogi burrito and Jamie had the bulgogi plate.  The meat was dry, and I had to ask for kimchi on the side.  Korean restaurant, kimchi ON THE SIDE???  There should have been kimchi IN everything.

Sorry, folks, I'm not going back."}
{"text":"This place is the one that won me over for fusion dishes, and enjoying a good amount of kimchi. I have yet to find a dish I never fully enjoyed. Also loving the idea of getting a good amount of food and not paying much, especially when I treat my sister out to lunch here. 
Their customer service is always good - very personable staff that I always see regularly when I make it out there."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. Parking was tight. I ate here with my family several months ago and we enjoyed the bulgogi burrito and bulgogi fries. I stopped here during a work lunch break and tried the bulgogi fried rice. I ordered a half order and it was surprisingly big. The dish was tasty. They gave chips and salsa and guacamole while I waited for my food."}
{"text":".. still some of the best in town. and the calamari tacos....wow. Bulgogi tacos still hits the spot for me."}
{"text":"Ate there the other day, and best description of their food.. \"wow\".

Instant seating, ambiance & location would only rate 1 star at most.. but the food makes all the diff and that IS the point of a restaurant.  

I had 2 Fusion Tacos, one with chicken and the other with pork.  I had no idea so much filler could fit on those little tacos, but they were both excellent - I especially loved the chicken one.  Hubby got the Bulgogi burrito and I could have sworn I saw little hearts fluttering around him when he bit into that monster.  I'll admit, I was surprised by the amount of damage he did to that, since I think there are countries with less land mass than that thing had.  And yes, I had a taste of it.. definitely a winner.

Oh, and I had made the mistake of ordering the Spam Musubi - not that there was anything wrong with it, just no room left to fit it into my tummy after the tacos.  Once I started on them, the musubi just kinda got forgotten about.. I took it home, though, and had it the next day - still tasty despite being a day old, so I'm betting it would have been fantastic when it was fresh.

We will definitely be back, and soon =D"}
{"text":"Loved everything bulgogi--tacos, nachos, combination plate.  It's all delicious, with very friendly service. Expect to wait longer than fast food; everything is made to order and worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS, make this on my stop on Las Vegas!  So good, I go home and crave it, living in the bay area wish we could have one so good!  Flavors all work so well together and their hot sauce is over the top good!   I just need to bring a container next time that I can fly home with!  I have been to both locations and give each the 5 stars!  Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the fusion tacos and burroto.  5% discount if you pay cash. Food works well.   Wull visit ecery tume in vegas."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Vegas. I've been a customer since their other location on Decatur. It's great to see a local family run restaurant and see the changes and improvements they've been implementing over the years.

I love their bulgogi fusion nachos with kimchi on top. The chimichanga is awesome too. The staff is great and the owner is always very polite and attentive. The prices are very good too. We walked out with a check for $22 for three people. Not many places in Vegas where you can get food from a local family for that price and for great service.

I highly recommend ordering from the fusion menu, asking for kimchi on top of whatever you get, and asking for the hot sauce that they bring out on the side (ask for it when they serve your food)."}
{"text":"I'm always up to try new food especially any fusion restaurants. I had the fusion burrito with spicy pork and the pork belly fries. They also gave complimentary tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole. I don't know what it was about the guacamole, but I couldn't get enough if it.

As for my fusion burrito, it tasted unique and great. The portion size was huge for what it was worth. For the fries, I got the half order for $6 and replaced bulgogi with pork belly for $2. The fries were cheesy with the right amount of spice, but I wish they gave more pork belly. I suggest getting the full order for $8 and just keeping the bulgogi.

This place is definitely worth a try though and the service is great."}
{"text":"Somehow the best way I can describe this place is CRAZY, UNLIKE NO OTHER.  What's better than Chinese Food and Mexican Food?  How about the 2 mixed together:)  Tacos topped with Bulgogi, Burritos filled with Bulgogi and a side of fried rice (WTH), fries topped with Bulgogi.  Oh man my mouth is watering writing this review.  Fun, Friendly Staff and A MUST for all Food Adventurers.  Until Next time KoMex"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem of a restaurant!  Who'dathunk that Korean and Mexican cuisine would fuse into awesomeness for your mouth?  I highly recommend getting the beef bulgogi burrito with a side of kimchi.  Be sure to scope out their website for weekly specials.  You get a whole lot of food for what you pay for, which is cheap!  Don't let the location intimidate you; most great places are tucked away in the most unassuming places."}
{"text":"Overall the prices of this place was really reasonable with large portions. The food was good but not amazing. The server was a doll but the atmosphere of the restaurant seemed a little run down and dirty.

I think the only reason I didn't love this place is because I had high expectations for this place! 

I can not get over how dirty this place looked. I ordered the lettuce wrapped with Bulgogi and again although an interesting concept, the food was not amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican enchiladas, good rice & beans! This place is a great spot for real fusion food! The service is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in for dinner a few weeks ago and we loved the place, The Food is great and the gentleman that owns it is very Nice, The mix of culture is awesome and makes for a great dish as well !!!! Hands DOWN BEST TACOS IN TOWN !"}
{"text":"I have now been eating at Komex pretty frequently for about five years and I am still on the first page of the menu :( I need more friends or I need to just buck up and order everything to go so I can try it all.

I checked on the menu and so far I have had:
Fusion Taco
Fusion Burrito
Fusion Flautas 
Fusion Nachos
Fusion Quesadilla
Fusion Sliders
KoMex Slaw
Bulgogi Fried Rice

Fusion tacos: Beef is my absolute favorite, pork belly second, calamari third and chicken fourth.
I can usually finish three tacos when at the restaurant and be fine without that super stuffed feeling. Or if I get something else it's usually entree (in this case flautas) + one taco. Two tacos plus something else for one person is really pushing it. Bring someone with you and share!

Fusion tacos an the flautas are by far my favorite.

I always get the San Pellegrino Blood Orange for my drink to wash everything down. :)

I have been to the second location as well (much closer to my house) but the original is my favorite just for nostalgia. Service is always awesome at both."}
{"text":"Solid place to grub. Service was great. They had Mexican pepsi on the menu but our server said it was not available at this location yet but should be soon. They did have Mexican coke so I had that. The real deal pepsi has me curious still so I will need to come back. 

Our visit started with free chips, guacamole, and salsa. I do not eat the green stuff so that went to the wife who liked it. I did think the salsa had a good taste. 

The chicken flautas here are very good yo! I am not much of a chicken fan but man these are good. Fried wontons were cheap and good. I don't remember what was in them, some type of meat but they were good. The main dish I wanted to try was the Beef Chow Fettuccine. It was a damn big portion and tasted great. The fusion tacos were okay but not my cup if regular tea. Priced here are reasonable. 

When the bill came I was surprised at how cheap it was for all the food we had. I also got a fortune cookie that had 2 cookies in it! Does this mean I am going to get extra lucky? I will be lucky enough to eat here again because I liked it."}
{"text":"Omg!! Why didn't I know about this place sooner? I've driven past it for years in a little strip mall. Everything I've had is absolutely amazing. I had the Bulgogi rice bowl, pork belly tacos, and the pork belly musubi, all are so delicious. Whether you try the fusion food or straight Mexican or Korean you can't go wrong. I only wish they were open earlier so I could grab in the morning!!"}
{"text":"You know a place is pretty damn good when people are still talking about it two hours after you have had lunch!  Komex is just such a place.

After reading on yelp, I made the suggestion for lunch on a Friday.  We arrived just before the lunch rush and seating four people was not a problem.  

After looking at the menu and knowing that I already love bulgogi, I went with two bulgogi tacos and shared a large portion of bulgogi fries.  Absolutely delicious!  Forks were parring each other to grab the next delicious bite.

When all was said and done all that was left was empty plates.

I was so geeked out on Komex, when I happened to be on that side of town, I took the Boy to enjoy the deliciousness this tiny, little Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant had to offer.

Who knew that one would have to wait for a lunch table on a Saturday!?

But we did even though waiting on a Saturday just plain SUCKS because I wanted the Boy to experience Korean marinated tastiness.

So we both ordered a fusion  burrito with bulgogi, mine also had fried kimchi.  We then did a half order of bulgogi ( I love that word) fries.

The ingredients are SUPER fresh, so fresh I felt myself getting a buzz with every bite. When dining on super affordable meal, don't forget to grab a hot sauce rack."}
{"text":"Over charged!! 7 dollars extra for pork belly instead of beef, when the plate itself is 10 dollars!!! Dingy dirty place!!! Cheaper at a nice korean or mexican resturaunt... should not call this place korean or mexican food its a really bad version on both! Nothing authentic nor fusion about it!! Not going back"}
{"text":"There is no better bang for your buck than Komex.  It is delicious and inexpensive.  It is the Korean fusion magic that they perform that makes it so amazing.  The wife and I have been many times and have never been dissatisfied.  To us, it is worth the over 10 mile drive.  The warmth of the owners/staff as well as the deliciousness of the food will keep us coming back again and again and again...."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! Bulgogi Nachos is a must along with the Bulgogi Fusion Taco. I can't wait to try more of the items on their menu. Affordable quality eats. 

This is a true hole in the wall so it's somewhat hard to find. When you do find it, you feel like you found a gem. I can't wait to go back. I just wish it was a little more centrally located, either way I'd make that drive."}
{"text":"Korean and Mexican fusion is becoming obscenely popular. We have quite a few fusion places in Portland (Koi Fusion, Korean Twist, etc), but KoMex just has everything to offer.

Large portions, cheap prices, funny logo, excellent service, delicious food and awesome owners.

You can tell that they value their patrons when you see their menu. Quite a few honorable mentions.

They have some of the best drink options, as well. I was having a hard time with choosing a drink. That sounds lame, but it's not often that you have the flavors mixed together that are found in this fusion food.

If you check in with your Yelp mobile app, you get a free order of fried wontons. Take advantage. They are little fried pillows of food heaven.

I decided on the bulgogi chimichanga with kim chi on the side. Good choice.

My jaw dropped when it came out. It was the size of a small baby (sorry for the scarring visual).

I saw it as a challenge.
Every bite became more delicious than the last.
No bulgogi meat was spared.
I killed it.

They bring you chips, too. Fresh fried chips. They might be the best chips ever.
I ate like King Henry VIII. I think my tummy hit the table by the time I was done.

While they are most popular for their fusion food, they also offer both asian and mexican food - separately. It's like a 3-in-1 restaurant. You could eat here 5+ times a week (I'm not condoning this, but it IS possible)."}
{"text":"good food for a great price. chips salsa and guac. large portions with great taste. it is a must go to for folks that love flavor. if you don't like flavor then move on..."}
{"text":"I did tacos which were cool.  Fusion fries not a big fan of. The tacodilla was good. And shrimp taco was outstanding. A little hole in the wall. Glad I tried though."}
{"text":"One more five star rating for this great hidden treasure. The fusion portion of the menu was incredible. Owners were very friendly. Prices were reasonable. 

Only down side is the crowd and the parking. With food this good, I understand why those are a problem."}
{"text":"Great food. Very customer friendly. Nice and clean. I will be back for sure. I love the bulgogi fries. Might try a burrito next time. Kinda small tho inside so if it's busy it can be a little annoying. The prices are great too. The $2 tacos are a great bargin. They could charge more for them. This place has a lot of high reviews for a reason lol. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The concept sounded exciting, but I found the food to be too much (I know, I know. . . most Americans would call me crazy for even saying that!), and the flavor lacking from what I expected based on the reviews.  It's kind of like a Chipotle with some Korean sauce.  The Nachos sunk to the bottom of my stomach and stayed there for quite a while (too much oil in the chips).  As with Chipotle, the burrito had waaayyyy too much rice.  Will not be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Best kimchi friend rice in the world. Bulgogi tacos and calimari Taco were legit too. Only reason I ventured so far off the strip is because of all the amazing yelp reviews and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"KoMex is one of my favorite go to spots in town. The fusion nachos and fries are always a good choice. Last time I went I tried the fusion pork belly tacos and loved them. I don't think I've had anything here that I don't like."}
{"text":"Two of my favorite cuisines. Service was prompt and polite. Food portions are huge for the price and it was super delicious! We will definitely come back and try out other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"At last they are our neighborhood! We got the kimchee fried rice with combo meat. They do an egg on top.  It was excellent.  We also got the chow fettuccine with chicken. I like it a little spicy. They have amazing sauc es. The sweet - spicy Korean is my favorite. Although we picked up the order to go it was just as good as if we dined in. That says a lot in itself! Great food and as always friendly service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Bulgolgi Tator Tots are absolutely amazing, like nothing I've tasted! I love the Korean/Mexican flare."}
{"text":"This was our second time enjoying KoMex when we visited Vegas. It's off the strip but well worth the drive. The food is fresh with tons of flavor. The service is great and the staff is friendly. We tried lots of different things on the menu and took to go boxes back to our room. Everything tasted great, there wasn't one dish that we didn't enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is divey.. clean.. but divey.  It's like the Roberto's of Korean Mexican fusion except I probably would have preferred Roberto's. Maybe I went in with the wrong mindset, I'm used to Korean food being somewhat healthy and I know depending on the Mexican food you could be looking at the perfect post-drunk grease or something you won't feel ashamed of after you've consumed it.  This food made me feel like I was clogging my arteries midway through the meal. The flautas with spicy Korean pork were somehow bland.  I don't even know how this is possible when spicy pork (mewoon daeji bulgogi) is anything but bland and it's the filling.  I got corn tacos with kalbi and spicy pork, they were okay.  My friend was destroying the kimchi fried rice, I'm not the hugest fried rice fan so I don't feel it's fair for me to try and review it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing so delicious and affordable. 2 dollar street tacos are incredible and the sweet spicy sauce.. Has me wanting to go back for more !!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place.  I think maybe sometimes anticipation makes for a huge let down.  
I'm from LA.  I am Korean.  I live in Ktown.  I grew up on the best home cooked Korean food around (shout out to my Ma!)
I also have access to the BEST Mexican food around.  LA has it going on.

So maybe...just maybe...these things worked against me in this instance.

I wasn't impressed with the Korean or the Mexican aspect of this place.  Neither really stood out.  I was thinking like Street taco style tacos with Korean spice.  
My mom pointed out that she and I could probably do better putting kimchee on street tacos in LA.  

I tried the chicken, pork and bulgogi tacos, the kimchee fried rice with spam and Spam musubi with fried egg.  
-The tacos were just okay.  The meat in all three really could have been kicked up a notch.  They weren't memorable at all.  Not even the slaw on top had any flavor.  I had to drench with hot sauce (sauces are really good.  they come in a holder with 3 sauces) and tons of lime juice.  I do really like that you can get them with tortillas or in lettuce cups.  add a star for that. 
-The kimchee fried rice was just too...mushy.  And the spam was chopped so fine and tiny that I couldn't taste it.  Either add more or don't cut them so tiny.  I want to taste the spam.  Why else would I order it?
-spam musubi with egg.  can't mess that up really.  

Service was kind of slow.  We had to ask our server for stuff or just get up and get it ourselves.  A few times she just ignored us completely.  Whatever.

I don't want to knock this place. I give them mad props for the creative aspect.  Another star for that.  They have a good following here.  I'm just saying...if you're used to really good Korean food and really authentic Mexican food, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"I would like to take the chef of KoMex home with me. Not because I met him and found him extremely attractive, but because I would like to wake up to the food everyday.

For starters, they serve these amazing, fresh, melt-in-your-mouth chips. Which are accompanied by salsa and guacamole. 
 
Calamari tacos are seriously unbelievable. Definitely worth leaving your boyfriend for. I'm kidding. No I'm not. 

Shrimp Fried Rice...If I didn't have an employer that made me sign a contract stating I'd maintain my weight and live a healthy lifestyle...I'd eat it everyday. Totally worth getting fat for."}
{"text":"We ate at KoMex for lunch on Saturday 3/30/13. We knew it was a popular place, so we went right when they opened at 11am.

We each ordered a taco fusion that we wanted and shared family style:
Fusion Bulgogi Fries (1/2 order) $5.99 - this was really tasty, and a half order was plenty for 5 of us to share.
Fusion Pork Burrito $5.99 - this was a huge burrito with Mexican rice, green & brown onions, pico de gallo, lettuce, soy/sesame base sauce.
Bulgogi & Spicy Pork combo rice plate $9.99 - the bulgogi was my favoriate, the spicy pork was my husband's favorite

I tried the pork fusion taco, others at our table had the beef fusion taco, and the calamari fusion taco.

Everything was yummy and so inexpensive. The bill was $37 for the 5 of us, and we took leftover food home!  We'll be back to KoMex!"}
{"text":"Soooooooo goooooood!! I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia! From now on when I go to Las Vegas I'm eating here every day...well almost. Super Yummy. I can't get over it!"}
{"text":"We got the sliders, tacos and rolled tacos. All were good but if you don't it it fast it becomes soaked in grease!"}
{"text":"The service is friendly. Price is ok. Food, on the other hand, is not impressive.

Highly overrated!!

Maybe I was there on a bad day. I definitely think this is a overrated place. Most of time Yelp can be a very helpful place to find good recommendations. But once a while, you find highly overrated places posted by hyped up yelpers posting with peer pressures. I guess nobody like to be a party pooper.

To justify my little speech, I have to talk about the food. Well, the bulgogi in my burrito tasted just like regular meat. I couldn't identify the Korean flavoring. The chicken and pork tacos were dry. You have to take a sip with almost every bite. I think it's because there was not enough salsa. 

Salsa should be fresh made fresh,not from cans if you are serving it in a restaurant. Especially if it's a restaurant with Mexican food. And if you use cabbage instead of lettuce, you will lose the watering effect when lettuce is being chewed. The problem can be fixed by putting more chopped onions and tomatos.

Anyway, just a little suggestion."}
{"text":"At first I was a bit skeptical about a korean-Mexican fusion restaurant, but this place had great reviews from other Yelpers so I gave it a shot. Boy am I glad I did! This restaurant is superb! I had a taco with Korean beef and all the fixins' of a regular Mexican taco. The beef literally melted in my mouth...sweet and spicy at the same time! My friend and I also shared the beef fries...comparable to carne asada fries, but with Korean beef. This place is amazing. The service was a bit slow which is why it gets 4 starts instead of 5. Komex...you are on to something magical!"}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday night and it was full, but not crowded.  Service was attentive and the food came out in a timely fashion.  

Order the nachos, they are amazing.  Everything we had was excellent.  

Go, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"So they've eliminated a few menu itms, and raised prices just a touch in hopes of branching off with other locations!! YAY!

So we hadn't been here in a while, the last time we were here, the service provided by the owner. I especially can't stand when small shop owners refuse to accommodate for their guests, but there was a total turnaround this time.

We 1 bulgolgi lettuce wrap and 1 in corn each as well as the combination fried rice (with pork instead of shrimp) and I also decided to try the wonton soup.. in the brink of summer.. 

WHY AREN'T YOU ALL ORDERING THE WONTON SOUP?! The broth was phenomenal, the wontons were huge and full of delicious pork. I'm a wonton soup connoisseur, and this was some of the best I'd ever had in the valley! After 2 spoonfuls of soup, I look up at Jason and tell him this was going to be a winter fave."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. One of the best things we ate in Vegas. The nachos are a must. Husband liked the wings. Good chips and fresh salsas and guac. Really tasty mix of Korean and Mexican. Price is right too."}
{"text":"It's the last week for the PBBBLT!  The special is  for the month of October only, but I think they should continue to serve it after this month! 

This is the take off of the BLT BUT with the addition Pork Belly (the PB) & (B) Bulgogi. This yummy creation is sandwiched between toasted white bread with lettuce and tomato. Just like your traditional BLT. The Komex twist adds a Sriracha mayo on the side. Oh yeah! 

Portion wise, pretty generous serving of their delish Bulgogi and thick fatty pieces of Pork Belly for sure! It was a challenge to eat it without the meat fillins falling out. I eventually ate it up with my fork and used the Sriracha mayo as a dipping sauce. Either way, this dish is too good to miss. Better get there before it's gone. It's not on the menu, but written on the white board as their feature item."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. I had the spicy pork and bulgolgi tacos and the bulgolgi fries (loaded). FLAVOR EXPLOSION IN YOUR MOUTH. Whoever came up with the idea of combining Mexican and Asian food is an evil genius. Service was okay and the wait wasn't too bad. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Out of Beef today at noon. I owned and operated a restaurant for 7 years. We made hundreds of pizza's a day. I ran out of cheese once....at 10:30pm....on our busiest night....ever. No beef, so I ordered the Bulgogi pork belly taco which was very tasty and fresh. Additionally, I ordered the Fusion Quesadilla w/chicken as recommended by the server. It was good but nothing real special. I think I need to go back when they have some beef, otherwise I have a hard time understanding the lofty rankings. Additionally, while the price was right the service was a bit clipped, even for a busy lunch and the buser refilling the drinks and setting the tables really didn't seem like he wanted to be there. To be clear, this would be a great spot to have in ones neighborhood, but if it's in your neighborhood, you don't need Yelp to find it. So if you're at the Cosmopolitan and thinking about getting your car out of valet or grabbing a cab up to Komex....think twice."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm half Korean and I'll admit that I thought fusing Mexican and Korean food was a little weird but I was proven wrong at this place. The chicken fusion nachos were amazing, prefect amount of flavor, toppings and nachos! I also got the kimchi fried rice and it was just like bibimbap and they used sour kimchi, so someone knew what they were doing. And the service was great, the waitress was very nice. Overall, very happy, will be back very soon :)"}
{"text":"The flavors are amazing at an unbelievable value.  We had the fusion tacos, tostada, and bulgogi fried rice.  Very tender bulgogi, excellent sauces.  Cheerful service.  A true gem.  I liked the old cook with the KOMEX black beanie.  He's hardcore fusion!"}
{"text":"Interesting fusion food.  The family was satisfied.  Big food portions.  Very clean and friendly service."}
{"text":"That moment when the food and the stars don't match up. For me fusion is Kogi, because it's literally two different types of food coming together: synergy. This place is more like segregation, the food just doesn't mix well. It's quite literally Mexican food and Korean food, served like a layer cake, none of it is combined in any culinary way. The burrito I got was dry, it was just bulgogi and lettuce in a wrapped, me choking with every bite on the way down. I won't continue, it just didn't do the job of fusing. Best part of that meal was my Mexican coke, which was what I got when I ordered a Mexican pepsi."}
{"text":"We waited over a year to try Komex, as the few times we were North, the place was swamped and we didn't have time to spare. That was our hint. Yesterday was our day. Summed up in one word. F A N T A S T I C. Now I learn they have a SW location at Buffalo/Flamingo, so YAY, much closer to us. We will be regulars. We each had burritos, which were tasty alone, but made divine by 4 homemade chef's sauces. So good, I might have to dine there again today...cravings..."}
{"text":"Fusion tacos (with kimchi), bulgogi sliders, combination fried rice, Korean, Mexican it's all excellent! Cheap prices too!"}
{"text":"If you've never tried fusion food, this is a great intro :) 
I'm a little bias since I'll pretty much order the same thing whenever I do visit this place and that's the bulgogi burrito. You definitely get your money's worth for how much food they give you and if you dine in, they give you chips & salsa. 
Just a heads up, bulgogi is sweet so if you're not prepared for a \"sweeter\" burrito, try something else. They have a couple different sauces to choose from and my favorite was the KoMex sauce. Didn't really try to figure out what it was made of, but you can never go wrong with house sauce. 
The place itself isn't too busy, last time everyone ordered for pickup so had the place to myself. 
They have two different locations if this one isn't closer to you, but the other location has a smaller parking lot. 
Don't eat here too often, but it's good !"}
{"text":"This place is BOMB! I crave it daily. You must try the bulgogi taco with kimchi and the kimchi fried rice. Both are excellent. You have to ask for kimchi on the taco."}
{"text":"went to one on flamingo and buffalo. wanted to try the food because of the reviews of the truck in LA, the food is worth trying alt east once but nothing worth remembering about, the price was decent but service can use some improvement."}
{"text":"Pretty interesting fusion of Korean and Mexican cuisines. Be prepared to be intrigued. Excellent food and service. Drinks are delivered in bottles or jars."}
{"text":"KoMex is yummy and fresh. KoMex is cheap. They had great service when I went here. So in my book, KoMex is awesome :)

They're known for their tacos, which is what they recommend I try first. Your choice of Korean-style chicken, bulgogi beef, or spicy pork. With corn tortillas, $1.29. With flour tortillas, $1.99 each. 
They have some traditional Mexican and Korean dishes you can order, but I think the popular items were all on the left-side of the menu, basically Asian- style tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. 

I ordered three tacos, trying each meat. Delicious! I'm looking forward to going back :)"}
{"text":"The price, food and sauce options are all great. Went with the fusion beef burrito + kinchi. You'll get tortilla chips to start (which is super crispy, love). Tables have 4 different sauces to pick from, if you like something with a kick, go for the komex spicy sauce :) 
Service was great since the place wasn't too busy, my cup was never empty. 
If you pay cash, you'll get 5% off the tab"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here and the prices are great. The staff is always super friendly. The fusion tacos are where it's at!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! One of my top 5 places in the valley to eat. The bulgogi fried rice is so good! Everything is! And everything is SO reasonably priced. My hubby and I always leave stuffed and usually for about $20. And the staff is so nice. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. You can tell that they love what they do and love talking about their yummy creations! 

OH! And I just saw someone mention that drinks are canned/bottled... this is true.... but they have the most delicious unsweetened iced tea (I think it is mango flavored) and there are free refills on that one! It is soooo good! Just go check it out... you won't be diappointed."}

I wanna eat right now
I'm Greg N, and I came to chow down
This place is not internationally known
But on the Yelp App on your new iPhone
It's near the top and so highly rated
In Las Vegas: and that's going to be debated
After you order, they give you fresh cooked chips
With pico de gallo and guacamole dips
Some of the best chips that I've ever had
This free offering made me feel real glad
Order three tacos with beef bulgogi
Right on par with that truck called Kogi
Keep the flo' cuz

I can't believe that here in Nevada
I ate the most amazing fusion tostada
Thick \"nurungji\" shell at its base
The fried tortilla with rice replace
With spicy pork bulgogi on top
With shredded cabbage here they don't stop
Pico de gallo they placed on too
And gochujang hot sauce was the flavor glue
One of the best dishes I've had all year
It made me happy, it made me there cheer
It's like PSY and Carlos Santana collaborating
On a megahit song. I'm celebrating
If you go here, order this dish
You will also say this is delish'

It takes two to make a food so right

Now the bulgogi fries are just OK
Not amazing as other Yelpers may say
And the kimchi fried rice was so-so
Many other places for kimchi fried rice would go
Just skip these two and just get
The tostadas and the tacos and you'll be set
Once you get a-hold of these two plates
And you chomp into the food so great
You'll be throwing your hands in the air
And waving them like you just don't care
KoMex is a foodie find
Get off of the buffet grind!

{"text":"Best Mexican in Vegas. Very good quality of food for fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"We found Komex on Yelp about 5 years ago, and it has become one of our all-time favorite restaurants. It's a simple hole-in-the-wall type restaurant, low price, large portions, unique dishes, and amazing flavors. We've tried about everything on the menu, and it's all crazy good. Some of the best tacos I've ever had, some of the best fried rice I've ever had, the best salsa and guacamole I've ever had.  Even the sliders...why do they have sliders at a Korean Mexican restaurant?? I don't know, but thank heaven they did because those sliders are AMAZING! Go to Komex!! Order anything and slap some Komex sauce on it. You'll crave it til you can go back..."}
{"text":"Oh my, this place was fantastic! It is a true hole in the wall type place. The food and service were fantastic. We tried several things and ordered WAY too much food. It was also so good and well worth it. The prices were pretty reasonable and the quality was top-notch. This place is far from our house but I'm make a special trip to go here. I'm a fan of good Mexican and Korean food so a place that combines the two works more me. Hopefully they will expand and put a few more locations throughout the valley."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a Mexican food person but I do enjoy it once in awhile. Plus I love Korean food too so this place hits the spot when I'm craving something like a burrito.

Comparing both locations , I like this location over the one on Decatur/north Las Vegas since it's much more spacious and they're more generous on the meat.

The food portion is very filling for it's price. My boyfriend and I ordered the beef bulgogi burrito w/ kimchi to share and a half order of their pork bulgogi fries for about 15$. We were only able to finish the burrito & had to take the fries to go bc it was too much ! Half portion of fries is huge and can be split among even more than two people. They also have ghost pepper sauce here which I prefer than tabasco sauce.

Complimentary chips, salsa & guac w/ your order and complimentary oranges at the end. Orders didn't take that long to come out. Service was very fast and efficient which I liked."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by the food here! Everything I've tried on the menu has been soooo yummy. The service is always prompt, and I know they are making things to order because any time I've gone with a group, none of our food comes out at the same time.. Some people are annoyed by that,but I like knowing that I order, they cook it, and then bring it out fresh and hot. They serve the food with a cart of 4 different hot sauces, ranging from mild and sweet to spicy..  I always love the food here. I'd give it 5 stars if the location was bigger and l little more upscale, but I'm totally comfortable with the smaller cafe feel of the place now."}
{"text":"I had high expectations after hearing so much about this place. It was ok. Everything tastes the same. A lot of items with bulgogi. I would like to have seen more variety. Pork belly tacos were nothing special; nachos were ok, order the small - large is huge and eating too much of it is a little overwhelming. I was expecting more."}
{"text":"Here' s the deal with this place, I've been here several times so I know I'm not full of shit. They are SLOOOOW and really disorganized. Don't go here lookin' to get in and out for your work lunch. It's not gonna happen.
That said, the food is pretty damn good. It's original for Las Vegas. Some hit and miss experiences but overall good.  To have this many reviews and maintain this high of a rating you gotta be doing something right. 

They just need to get their kitchen in order for how popular they are."}
{"text":"In my travels, restaurants out of the \"norm\" are hot on my radar.  Korean-Mexican Fusion is always a sweet spot for me.  So, when I found Kormex on Yelp I was excited.  I was not disappointed.  The menu is full of amazing food, and I wanted to order more than I did, but I had a plane to catch, and extremely full does not go well with 30,000 feet.  I had the Bulgogi Beef Burrito.  It was delicious!!!!  The staff was very friendly, and took the time to make sure I was taken care of despite a busy lunch rush.  Next time I am having the Bulgogi Beef Fries, and shrimp tacoma.  Yes, I will be back, and I have already planned my order.  Go here!"}
{"text":"If you love Mexican food and Korean food then you will definitely love this place. Their beef is tender and full of flavor. Don't forget a side of kimchi. They also have four different types of sauces you can eat it with. Prices are also very fair for all the food you get.

It is across from he Ford dealership as it is pretty easy to just drive by without even noticing it. 

I believe it is family owned and operated; service is always good!"}
{"text":"Was a little skeptical at first with the whole Korean Mexican mixture, I'm super happy that I stopped here to eat. The food was delicious, the service was great and the location was well maintained. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area wanting to try something new"}
{"text":"Food was satisfying and not overloading, felt nourished after eating 3 tacos. I liked the Korean and MX fusion, would definitely eat there again, this place is a new favorite.
Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Fair prices."}
{"text":"I knew I had to go to this place when I saw it on LV's top five restaurants lists. My need to come became urgent when I discovered that 5 of my Yelp friends gave it five stars. When I realized it was less than two miles from home, I rearranged my plans and went by last night.

I love Korean, I love Mexican, and I really love fusion. The menu made my mouth water, and from the sound of it, this place was poised to become my new favorite restaurant.

But somehow I was underwhelmed.
BF and I went a little nuts and got the bulgogi nachos and the bulgogi cheesesteak, then added in the won ton soup for good measure. The nachos were tasty, but after getting the free chips and salsa/guac it was almost chip overload. The cheese was plentiful yet subtle, and the salsa had a light fruitiness to it- a lot of different flavors somehow came together really well. The cheesesteak is the stuff dreams are made of, for my BF- he inhaled it. Huge portion, great value for the price, but for me it lost the excitement after a few bites and the fries were just right (in terms of cooking- they were perfectly crisp) but bland (no salt or seasonings).
The won ton soup was our only non-fusion item and it was a good-sized portion with plenty of won tons and a light yet flavorful broth, with lots of onions. The description mentioned mushrooms but I only found one- not clear if they were inside the 'tons and one popped out, or if there were meant to be more.

Service leaves a lot to be desired. Only one waitress for the whole place, fairly slow and a bit too casual for my liking, but we did get our food and their business did pick up so I should probably not be quite so picky.

Overall, the food was tasty- enough so that my BF ordered a burrito go to to take to a friend he wanted to introduce the food to- but after so many five star reviews and a great rating, I just had hyper-inflated expectations, I guess.
Will be trying the burrito myself next visit- wasn't in the mood for one last night, but maybe that dish will push me into five-star territory."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I've been here at least 10 times and they never disappoint.  The bulgogi fries and tacos are excellent.  They deserve 100 stars and they're prices are freaking great!!!!

This is where the locals go!!!!!!!  Even saw a bunch of cops eating here, so you know it's good."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at a FANTASTIC price!!  I got Jim's Bulgogi Fried Rice and still have half the plate left over when I was through.  I have a whole meal left in the refrigerator and for the price, you can't beat it!  I will definitely be back to try more of the Fusion items.  Thanks Yelp!  Great 1st find for me!!  :-)"}
{"text":"Back in Los Angeles, \"Kogi\" is the heralded as the best Mexican/Korean fusion food especially since they are reported to have first introduced the idea. I don't care who started it or what not, but Komex is far better.

Owned by a middle-older aged married(?) Korean couple, Komex express offers a variety of fusion made foods rooted from Mexican and Korean style. They not only serve fusion tacos but they also serve the traditional tacos with pastor, asada, and etc. And no this ain't no Roberto's, it's actually legitimate Mexican food that they serve. 

In my first visit, I ordered a pastor taco, asada taco, and bulgogi fries.

The tacos were nothing special nevertheless, delicious and they are as good as it gets. 

The bulgogi fries were amazing. For those of who you don't know what bulgogi is, it's marinated beef. And in this case, it is cooked and cut to small pieces so that it can be collected when forked upon along with the fries, cilantros, and etc. Oh man were these good. If a half hispanic and half Korean were to have tried these, I'm sure they would have had a identity crisis.

The only negative thing I would say about this place is the location. It is located right on the border of las vegas and north las vegas, south of the intersection of decatur and washington. I would love for the owners to move or start up another business more in Spring Valley or the South because that is where they are surely to get more business. 

If you're a biracial with Hispanic and Korean in your blood, be prepared to see a psychologist after trying the bulgogi fries cause that food may confuse you of your ancestrial roots and ethnic identity!"}
{"text":"A stupid friend recommended this place and I was not disappointed. It is a combination of Korean and Mexican food. I've been here at least 4 times now and I always try a different dish. As much as I try not to, I always finish my plate. Hehe! Thanks Kevin! You're always so pleasant."}
{"text":"Must try if your into fusion food. The chicken fries was awesome. Got the half and it was awesome. Great food for the bucks. The bulgogi sliders were awesome too.
This place has great people that will take care of you."}
{"text":"Wow. Walking into this place, I did not expect to be as blown away as I was. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with this place at all. It's very clean, quiet, and actually decent size, but the inside isn't that interesting. But honestly, with the food as good as it was I couldn't care less about the decor. We started with the complimentary chips and salsa- which I'm a sucker for. The salsa was yummy and the chips were made in house- I think. Next came the fried wontons. HOLYYYYY MOTHER OF PEARL! I could have eaten a couple orders of those and been good to go! The flavor was absolutely delicious. They were perfectly crisp, and the meaty inside was just so juicy and flavorful. Next came the fusion tacos which we got lettuce wrapped and wow. The meat was tender, the slaw was a great crunch and the pico was perfect. All the flavors married together for a perfect little food wedding in your mouth. Next up was the Nachos. YUM. The chips were crunchy. Meat was tender. Sauce was saucy. Cheese was melty. It was all just sooooo good. I was more than pleasantly surprised with this place. The hostess/waitress was super nice too. Honestly, if you haven't yet, do yourself a favor and give this place a try. I can't wait to go back and get some of those fried wontons and try some other treats off the menu!"}
{"text":"I have never tried a Korean Mexican fusion so we had to come here and see what it was all about. Pretty good food. Couldn't taste much of the Korean fusion, but all still good. 

Fish taco (4 stars): Liked these tacos the most. Had the most flavor. 

Shrimp taco (3 stars): Shrimp are so tiny! Wish I would have known it was baby shrimp. 

Chicken Fries (3.5 stars): A little bland. Needed more flavors. We loaded on hot sauce haha. I lived in San Diego for 4 years where Mexican food ruled, so these cannot compare to the pollo asado fries I would get down there.  

Complimentary Cips (4 stars): Crispy and good! So addicting to munch on.  

SERVICE (5 stars)
Everyone was really nice. 

ATMOSPHERE 
Almost like a fast food restaurant but not since you can sit down and they will come to get your order. Clean tables. Got pretty busy towards closing time."}
{"text":"Food was good! Thanks for the recommendation Jose :)"}
{"text":"Was a great place to get our kimchi rice fix(: 
Bulgolgi burrito: amazing! Refreshing as well
Kimchi fried rice: superb! I highlly recommend you ggetting it"}
{"text":"There are two locations. The other location is closed on Sunday! Complimentary nachos with guacamole and salsa. 

We tried the fusion nachos and the fusion burrito. The fusion nachos were surprisingly good! The bulgogi is tender and tasty. There's also salsa and jalapeños on the nachos.

I wasn't that impressed with the fusion burrito. I wasn't into the salad part of the burrito. The bulgogi and rice and salsa and the veggie flavors didn't really jive well together. 

Service is good though! Waitress and waiter both very friendly."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how people eat here. These people leaving nice comments must be friends or families member of the owners. My husband and I ordered take out. When we first walked in it smelled like old rotten food like they don't refrigerate their food. Once we got home and opened the food it smelled the same way. My husband got the kimchi fried rice and as soon as he took a bit he spit it out. I can't believe these people make a living off of this shit. I'm usually not the one to be picky but my gosh this place is the worst. I thought I should give you guys a heads up before you order from here. If you don't believe me just walk into the place and see how it smells."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! This is the only place that sells Korean food mixed with Mexican food and I love that. I always order the kimchi fried rice with spam OMG it's so good. And you're able to order spam musubi here with an egg in it and it honestly tastes better with the egg. 
Service is 3/5 lady is nice and served us not right away but she eventually served us it just takes a while for food to cook so it'll be a bit waiting too 
Pricing isn't too bad it's affordable and worth the amount of food you get. 
They also allow for pick up too so if you just wanna pick up your food to eat at home you can or you can dine in (btw this place isn't fast food)
The inside was big, spacious lots of places to sit and there's a tv so you can watch the game yay! lol overall I feel this place deserves a 4 star. 
Back to food I also ordered a bulgogi fries and it was pretty different just because they changed the meat to bulgogi it actually made the fries a little more sweet but that made it taste better because it's a combo of spicy and sweet? Idk but yeah this place is worth a try I'd recommend"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after reading the good reviews & having been suggested to me by a couple of friends but I ended up disappointed. The food wasnt bad. Tasted okay. I had the bulgogi fries which was probably the best tasting thing we ordered. My boyfriend ordered the bulgogi fusion burrito which was okay tasting too but was still missing something. My sister orders the bulgogi plate which was just bland. It was just bulgogi & rice which I could have made at home. I asked for a side of kimchi & the portion was so small. It was literally a spoon full of Kim chi which also didnt taste very good. Besides the food tasting just okay the customer service was not great. Idk if it was because they were busy or what but when I called to order for pick up the guy on the phone seemed irritated & was rushing me. Whatever the deal is & even if its busy your customer service should always be on point. Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying."}
{"text":"Always awesome to eat here. I highly suggest trying the calamari fashion tacos! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Perfect mix of Korean and Mexican fusion. We ordered many items to sample and share. 

First we ordered the Beef Tostada.  It was a nice mix of Korean (the crispy rice and beef bulgogi) and Mexican (cabbage and salsa). 

Next, we had the Chicken Nachos.  This dish was delicious and probably the favorite dish of the night. Layered with cheese, perfectly seasoned chicken, tomatoes and jalapenoes this dish is a must try!

One member of our group ordered the Spicy Pork Quesadilla, while another ordered the Kim Chee Fried Rice. The fried rice was spicy but delicious. 

I ordered the Chicken Chow Fettucine.  It was nice, but not my favorite dish of the night. 

Overall I would return. Staff is friendly, there's a lot of parking and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place based on a friend's recommendation. It was very good! We tried their Bulgogi burrito and it makes you think why has no one ever done it before. The staff was helpful and friendly and through the yelp deal, we got a free order of fried wontons. Their chips and salsa was also tasty.

The only downside is that I wished they had a bigger location do seating wouldn't be a problem. With how popular this joint is becomingg, customers are having some trouble fighting for tables."}
{"text":"Let me suggest you spend your money else where. My fellow employees and I had been long time patrons of this establishment until today. Due to our restricted lunch time we placed an order in advance to eat in the establishment. When we arrived the food was packed to go and we all paid for our meals. We explained that we were going to stay and eat and immediately received attitude. Let me say this...in our party there was a Hispanic male, white woman and two black women. The male in our party asked if we could have chips (which are complimentary for dine-in). The gentlemen (owner) behind the counter proceed to yell and state to the Hispanic male in our party that this was not Taco Bell and he couldn't have things his way....very racists. Then he proceeded to call him an asshole and walk up on him yelling in his face. Let's say it was really close to becoming physical. Thankfully there was a cop in the establishment who deescalated the situation. We will make sure to pass the word on in our business so they understand the type of people who own and work for this restaurant. Dont support this business. I work for an organization that is well over 4000 employees and I train new employees every year. There have numerous occasions I have been asked what was a great place to eat and I would refer them to this establishment but not any longer. Sad to believe racism, prejudice and terrible service still exist to this day."}
{"text":"Don't understand the rave reviews at least not for the fusion fish tacos. They are pretty bland with no pop for a place that has Mexico and Korean flavors. Anyway the toppings were fresh which is good and their salsas were good too.  I just expected more taste in the fish and batter.  Waitress was friendly and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Love the nachos and the chimichanga. Great Tex mex style food with a Korean kick. If I had one complain I wish they had a soda machine with refills.  But even without that I had a blast."}
{"text":"This was the best food I have ever had.

We ordered a lot of bulgogi. Bulgogi fries, bulgogi burrito, bulgogi chimichanga, and a two meat bulgogi plate.
We only ordered half orders, but there was so much food we had to get to go containers.

And the wait staff was super friendly. He was smiling the entire time and quick to notice if we needed anything.

I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Tacodilla is so good that it may be the best thing that I'll eat on this Vegas vacation.  It's a specials menu item that is so delicious that I'd love to convince the owners to open a KoMex in Phoenix where I live."}
{"text":"Komex is a must when we go to Vegas.  We have been to the other location a few times and decided to try this location on a Sunday. (This one is closed on Monday, the other is closed on Sunday).

We shared a 1/2 order of beef nachos and 1/2 order of pork fried rice.  The 10-year ordered the calamari tacos.

The nachos were my favorite, I think I prefer their beef over the pork.  Huge portions and these were just the 1/2 orders.

This location is a bit further out from the strip, but its roomier, newer, and cooler (literally, like better air conditioned) than the first location."}
{"text":"Asian-Mexican Fusion! I recommend the Bulgogi Nachos..they are amazing. As much as everything pretty much. So much food for $! Don't be put off by the sketchy neighborhood, cause you know it will be good"}
{"text":"Wow! Just got back from Ko Mex. Wife & I spent a whopping $19.55 for 3 fusion tacos, 2 tacquitos & kimchee fried rice!  Ko mex is just as most reviewers see it, a small shop in a strip mall that I would have easily passed had it not been for Yelp.

We drove the 10 miles from our hotel to try Ko Mex. All I can say is I wish we had one of these in Torrance. The Fusion tacos, both beef & chicken with kim chee were absolutely DEEEE LISH ISSS! But my fave was the lettuce wrap with pork! I let my wife taste it ( she had the kim chee rice ) & she wolfed 3/4 of the wrap while I was sucking down a Pina Jarrito! 

Great service, we were so lucky it wasnt too busy so service was extra qwik. I love hitting these places during non peak days as you feel unrushed and can really enjoy the food....Oh btw, we had to bring half the rice home cuz we were so full! Add in orange & fortune cookies for dessert & you have one Fantastic place to Eat. So happy we found this treasure!"}
{"text":"Excellent stop for fresh fast food. I say fresh because they cook it (food) after you order and fast because they deliver it quickly. However, this place is not your traditional restaurant; it is a creative twist on Mexican and Korean - blended into one. Definitely worth visiting, even if you don't come to appreciate the choices on the menu (you will) since the food is so inexpensive (and good) that you'll feel like you are ripping them off."}
{"text":"Just bloody brilliant ! Love this place !! Great fresh fusion that is off the hook. Bolgogi beef and pork! Everything here is top knotch, and the best secret in Vegas !"}
{"text":"After much searching for this place the bf and I finally went! A tiny little hole in the wall tucked inside of a very bland string of other businesses. Barely noticeable from the street, I wonder if I would ever have run into this place if on my own!

Walking in, the lime green walls and \"older\" furniture left me wondering what kind of boyfriend I had and whether I should turn and run. Thank goodness I didn't! We were seated immediately and given drinks and fresh guac and salsa. The chips tasted freshly fried and delish! 

I was weary about the fusion type. Can these two foods REALLY go together? Are my beans going to run into my kimchi and vice versa? I left my worrying aside as I ordered the fusion burrito. I chose chicken to be safe. The bf had bulgogi tacos. Our food arrived pretty quickly. My eyes grew huge when I saw my burrito! WTF?!?! The thing was gigantic!!! When I opened it up and started to eat I paused after the first bite. HOW DAMN DELICIOUS! The thing was too big to finish and I regretted having a big lunch before stopping here for dinner! haha! The marinated meat was better than I had at more expensive restaurants with nicer decor, etc. The tacos were great too. I just had to steal a bite. The meat was soft and cooked just right. Not overcooked or rubbery as we've had in other fast food places. The people working were so sweet and checked on us often. 

Towards the end of our meal when I thought I could not fit in another bite, our server came up to us with half a sliced orange and two fortune cookies. It was a very sweet gesture. Free dessert AND a palate cleanser! ha! The perfect touch to a great dinner!"}
{"text":"This location is way less busy than the original and the food is just as amazing. I love anything with pork belly and Komex has great pork belly (not just the fatty garbage that other places call pork belly). 

I strongly recommend the kimchi fries rice, it's very unique and unlike anything you've had before."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good and friendly service. I had the chow fettecini while my wife had the quesadilla w/ bulogi...and we split a 1/2 nachos lol. We were hungry :) Bathroom needs to kept up though. Still overall good experience from California visitors :)"}
{"text":"Passed by and decided to try it out!! This place is so yummy. A mix between Korean and Mexican. The bulgogi plate is simple yet flavorful!"}
{"text":"Tacos mixed with Korean BBQ.. what else could you want! I ordered the Korean tacos and got one of each (Pork, Chicken, Steak and Tofu). I thought each taco was well seasoned and great portioned. For a street style taco, they were spilling with meat and cabbage slaw. Their Kimchi Fried rice was also super delicious. It has a little
Kick but nothing that would require a cool beverage. The food was amazing and that's where the rating comes from. However, don't expect great service. The waitress seemed overwhelmed or just in a bad mood. She didn't have any suggestions and was seen tapping her foot at a nearby table. So if you don't mind bad service for great food, check this place out but leave the high expectations on the food."}
{"text":"I got the Beef Bulgogi bowl and spicy chicken fusion nachos!  Both awesome!  My wife ordered the Kim chew fried rice and my daughter ordered the beef bulgogi sliders...delicious!  Why have I never been here before?!  Will definitely come back...over and over!"}
{"text":"Wow. Great food great servers. I went with my family. My son had fusion flautas and they tasted great. The salsa which seemed to have a bit of avocado tasted great with them. My wife had the wings. Those wings don't need ranch or blue cheese. We took a friend for his birthday and he had a bulgogi bowl. It look very very appealing and made me want to change. The Kim Chi fried rice was a plate I ordered for the table and we all enjoyed it immensely. I'll be back without a doubt."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Outstanding food. Enjoyed every bite. Had 3 tacos and Kim chi fried rice. I don't even like Kim chi that much but this was to die for. My son had the Flautas. I had a bite of those and they were great. The whole family is waiting to go back and we will. Service was great. Never waited long for anything. We didn't go to Decatur we went to the one on buffalo. Couldn't find it so I wrote this down anyway."}
{"text":"WIth all the rave reviews on yelp, my friends and I thought we'd give it a try. 

The restaurant is pretty small, and rather crowded with other yelpers. Expect to wait a few minutes for a table to clear up or order take out. 

The food was decently priced for the portions you were given. The bulgogi burrito was amazingly delicious, and I would recommend it to any first timers going to komex. Sharing fries was a good decision, as it took 3 of us to finish the plate. 

We had to pay at the counter, like a school cafeteria, but that was most likely because of the limited staff. 

Good food, good price, not the best environment."}
{"text":"omfg so bomb i nutted after every bite. definitely a bang for your buck over here."}
{"text":"Yo KoMex...Dawg...Where have you been all these years i've been living in Vegas?!?!

I'm not from LA i'm from NorCal so the whole Korean/Mexican fusion never hit me until i started thinking about it and realizing that...holy shit it just might work...

Would have LOVED to try out more of their fusioned foods but man 4 lettuce wrapped (low-carb) tacos filled me up.

Went here for a 2nd round taco eating contest UYE. Winner narfed down an amazing 12.5 tacos. TWELVE AND A HALF!!! i was stuffed after 4 and those were low-carb'ed.

All the meat choices were pretty awesome, if i were to pick a favorite...i would just get them all. Are they a bit on the small side? Sure, they are street style after all but man oh man KoMex doesnt hold back when they stack the toppings on. 

Also love the way they dice up the kimchi so you can get some in every bite. Great stuff.

Now if only there was a fusion of Horchata..."}
{"text":"Definitely delicious and worth the drive. Best bulgogi tacos I've ever had. We also had bulgogi nachos which were just as good. Service was excellent and prices were very reasonable.  Will def come back. Don't know if I'd come here at night given its location in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp software man.  'cha-ching'. This place was close to my son's soccer tournament in Las Vegas's Summerlin neighborhood. I needed a break from 'team food'. I pulled in and got 1 order each (two in each order) of spam and spam/egg. Large musubi with an 'obi' of wide nori seaweed. They were excellent and a meal unto themselves. 

2 kalbi kimchi taco's were double corn tortillas fit the bill. It was more than Max and I could eat, late night back at the hotel. I would want to try their soups, if I was eating there. The hotspots and soups of Korea and Mexico go hand in hand with their use of spice and acidity (read vinegar). Next time.....

Highly recommended. Almost very table was full when I was there. The Korean gentlemen running the place does a great job! Thank you!!

Summerlin, NV and the surrounding areas have been easy to navigate - pretty community. For you futbal fans, perfect pitches!!!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!  Bulgogi burrito (however you spell that) was absolutely yummy.  

No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Visiting fr CA, happy they took reservation as I was meeting up w/local friends who had never been here and heard it was hard to get in cuz its always so busy. Table was ready half hr before I arrived per one friend who arrived early.  Service was outstanding. Food was delicious as the bulgogi was marinated perfectly and tender.   We shared  everything bulgogi: PBBBLT,  nachos, rice bowl, rice plate, as well as spam kimchi fried  rice and musubis.  The iced tea was a plus!  I need to go back and try the chimichanga and burrito.  If you like bulgogi with a mexican twist... Komex is the place!"}
{"text":"Awesome, just delicious all around. Would like to let the owners know that they need to  check their Mexican soda inventory because some of it seemed flat on our last visit. But no need to remove stars, keep the food coming!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend since she was on a budget and we needed a place to eat, she told me this place is super delicious, glad that I went with her, cuz now this place is definitely on my go-to list!

So far, I have only tried the fusion tacos, in both beef and chicken, I personally like the beef better just because I love bulgogi xD The corn tortillas are small, but with alot of fillings. When I first looked at it, I was like, \"How am I supposed to eat this without being messy?\", but my friend was like, \"You just can't be afraid to get messy.\" And yeah, it gets messy, but once you take a bite, it's worth the mess :p

Also, I tried the bulgogi fries, the portion is huge, good enough to share with your friend if you guys are not eating anything else, and the fries... very very very good. I love these kind of fries that have toppings on top, with all the cheese, bulgogi, kimchi, jalapenos, and other ingredients, this fries is a little spicy and a little sweet, just amazing!

I also tried the Bulgogi Tostado, but I had it when I was like full already after the 2 tacos and a little bit of fries, so I don't remember much from it, and I didn't have much of this dish. All I remember was that the rice was crispy, but a little hard. If I have another chance, I might get this again when I'm not that full.

I took another friend there, and she ordered the bulgogi burrito, she told me it was good, and after that, she drove all the way down there to get that burrito again, must be really good :)

As for the service, some people complained that the lady was unattentive, but please cut her some slack. That place is packed and she's the only one that's waitressing! When I was there and it was busy, you can tell she tried her best to keep everyone satisfied. I actually thought she is a really good waitress, nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I've never ordered anything from here that disappointed me. My boyfriend is obsessed with their fried rice and usually orders a chicken/pork combo. I love their veggie tacos, kimchi fried rice, and tofu fried rice. They really know how to infuse both Mexican and Korean flavors and make it so delicious. Their kimchi fried rice is so damn good. It has a good spice level with a generous portion of kimchi and is topped with a fried egg. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I'm so glad this place is nearby because there are days I don't wanna go out to eat and I'd rather have take out so I can be fat and lazy at home lol."}
{"text":"This place was right next door to the school we had a basketball tournament at so I though I should just check it out. It was an interesting concept having Korean infused Mexican food. I decided to play it safe and got the kimchee fried rice. It was pretty good but it didn't knock my socks off. I tried my friends cheesesteak and that was pretty bomb. I'd be open to coming back to eat here again and probably be a little bit more adventurous. 

The key negative here is the slow service and the fact that they take forever to bring your bill and pick up your check. Was about to give it a three but I guess I'm just in a good mood right now."}
{"text":"went here today with my son and his girlfriend, we had the buldogis fries and the buldogis and spicy pork cheesesteaks.  I thought they were absolutely yummy and my son loved the spicy pork.  It was sooooo much food we took half of it home.  They were very friendly and service was great.  We will def be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I dont think i can put into words how much i enjoyed there food here! The bulgogi burrito w/kim chee was amazing. This place has such good prices and for the amount of food you receive you wont be disappointed but im sure youll be going back for more. The Korean musubi was another thing i was able to try and even that, such a simple dish but made with a twist, so ono! My co worker got the Mongolian beef stir fry with fried rice and the plate was also pretty huge and the taste was definitely a winner! Theres alot of free parking and its not hard to find. So next time your in the area definitely stop in at KoMex!!!"}
{"text":"What do you get when you mate the land of Starcraft with the country of donkey shows?  You get KoMex.  Don't let this Korean and Mexican fused restaurant fool you with its weird fusion of ingredients.  KoMex will make you fall in love with it and will make you put a ring on it.

We arrived about a half hour when it opened and there were people sitting at tables.  Fortunately, we were able to get a table for 6 with the quickness.  We sat down and admired the paintings on the wall:  people with the mixture of Korean and Mexican features.  Oh, it didn't stop at the paintings, it was also on the menu.  

We opened up the menu and explored it....hard.  Damn, everything sounded good.  Burritos, tacos, fries, rice platters, you name it they got it.  We decided we were going to order about 2-3 plates each because everyone on Yelp were saying this place was awesome.  

The waitress was super cool-- big smile on her face, cracked jokes with us, made fun of us, and overall, made us feel like family.  As she wrote down our orders I know she was thinking to herself ,\" Man, these guys are high.\"  Haha......maybe...just kidding.  Crack is whack!  D.A.R.E.!

I ordered 2 fusion steak tacos, 1 pork belly fusion taco, a half plate of fried rice, and a half plate of fusion fries.  I'm a big boy, and I need big boy food.  Let me say this-- when I got my food, the half portions looked like full meals.  Geez....I wouldn't have been surprised if my heart gave out on me that day.  

The fusion tacos were delicious, especially the pork belly.  So fatty, greasy, flavorful, but enough about me, let's talk about the fried rice.  The fried rice was something your parents made at home.  Sike.  This fried rice was way better than what your parents made.  The rice actually didn't taste stale!  I swear, most fried rice dishes you can taste the staleness of it.  But this rice, this rice was soft and delicious.  Oh, don't let me get started on the fries.  DON'T LET ME GET STARTED.  Do I really have to say something about them?  Ok.  Fries good, communism bad.

By the way, this place gave us a free full plate of pork nachos.  I don't care if they dropped it on the floor.  Shoot, if it did fall on the floor, the floor tasted just as good as the food.

KoMex, will you marry me?  Seriously, everyone must try this place out.  Let me say this-- it's wayyyyy better than Arby's."}
{"text":"Ok... now to rate this small quaint spot that I can do every now and then. I ordered the fried rice and it was pretty good. A little dry, but the flavor was good. Not my choice of dine-in as it's a little diner-ish to me. Lots of in and out loud traffic, loud tv right about booths. Waitresses a little not presentable. I would change that FAST. Appearance is Everything!
A few of the tables had been left dirty, another thing they need to work on. It made the place look shabby and dirty...uncared for."}
{"text":"Great food. Great customer service. The quality of the ingredients really shines. The owner was really nice and very attentive. The chimichanga with bulgogi was delicious. Docking one star as the chairs are a bit torn up and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars but I honestly think the quality of food since the new location opened, has dwindled ever so slightly. With that being said, for a great price you can eat delicious spicy pork with white rice or savory Korean/Mexican fusion tacos! I would recommend trying this place to anyone looking for a Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Las Vegas. It is hard to find unless you know where to look but the search is worth it. It sounds like a strange combination of Mexican and Korean but it makes for some fabulous tastes. The food is cooked fresh and the portion sizes are huge! My wife had the Bulgogi Chimichanga and we couldn't believe how big it was and how great it tasted. I had the Carne Asada and it was very authentic not the typical Tex-Mex style Mexican food that generally gets served. Since everything is made fresh, you can add or take away from any of the dishes. This will definitely be a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews, I had to try it! I haven't had too many 'fusion' type meals and so what better place to have it then somewhere Yelpers are constantly raving about!!

After a couple U-Turns, finally spotted the place.. I would of never noticed this place, probably even if I passed by everyday..

Came with chips, salsa and a guacamole dip: Chips were extra crispy/thick and kinda sweet. Salsa was ok and guac tasted pretty fresh.

Bul-Gogi (beef) taco: The beef tender, juicy and lots of flavor! Topped with Cabbage, tomato, cilantro, green onions.. Basically what you find in a typical mexican street taco.. All on a corn tortilla.  

Daeji-Gogi (pork) taco: The pork, tasted even better than the beef! Wow, I never underestimate the magic of pork but I felt it was slightly tastier!! Same toppings and also on a corn tortilla

* Both tacos were Excellent, they both had a slight distinct bitter bite to them probably from the cabbage and Both were Generously portioned (could probably split each one into 2 little ones by using 1 of the 2 corn tortillas per taco) Also, from the 3 hot sauce condiments (Chinese, Korean and Mexican), I prefered the Chinese hot sauce with either of the tacos (Warning - it definitely packed some heat!) I had Kimchi placed on the side and that was Delicious and another great addition to the tacos or even by itself.

I was gonna order more tacos but I wanted to try something other than the obvious so  I went with:

Pan Fried Fish: some type of white fish, filet on top of steamed white rice and \"marinated soy sauce\" This fish was sort of salty, smokey and just flaked right off. The sauce had that roasted sesame flavor and I believe was the key element of the dish. Poured the sauce all over the filet and every bite felt complete.. Great Strong Flavors and another Good Portioned dish

Unsweetened Brewed Mango Passionfruit Decaffeinated Iced Tea: came with raw sugar and regular sugar packets. I prefer one regular sugar pack per full serving. Smooth and Refreshing! 

Orange: Another freebee, a half orange ornately sliced as a fancy looking little fruit dessert..

Service felt very comfortable, Value was very wallet friendly in terms of quality and quantity, Atmosphere don't expect much.. But Who Cares! Come here to get a Great Tasting Budget Meal!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing price, the most friendly staff! Love the new location withy the option to get some ice cold beer. 

The owners couldn't be nicer and their food is always fresh and delicious! My favorite spot in Vegas for a quick, cheap, and yummy meal!"}
{"text":"It's Mexican.

It's Korean.

It's both.  And I love it!

This is spot is small.  It's cramped.  There's no signs of the warm welcome of corporate American name tags or signage.  There's just really good, unique fusion food.  And most of it is cooked on the hot grills right out on display.

The fusion flautas, fusion Bulgi tacos, and kimchi fried rice all combine for a meal that I was not expecting.  It's sweet hot like Korean. But it kicks with a Mexican spice and flare.  I wasn't totally sold on fusion before this place.  And my Korean friends cringed when I asked them what they thought of the idea.  But after they tried it, it was all smiles.

Its tucked into a small strip mall so you may have to search to find it.  But you should search, because it's worth the find."}
{"text":"Drooooooling. 
Totally drooling.  It was everything that I thought it would be.  I wanted to come here for the longest time, but it's so damn far.  

It's located in a small plaza, but you can't miss it.  You can categorize this spot as a hole in the wall for sure-  You won't miss it.  You can't miss it. 

The fusion is amazing.   Mexican and Korean!!!! are you kidding me?  It's like two of my most favorite food worlds colliding and having a baby.   like a Brangelina baby.  

My daughter was who knows where on what trip, but this visit consisted of me, my husband, and son.  We love korean food as a family.  Mexican... me and the daughter are pretty much the only ones that will suggest it.   So that being said... here we go.  

So here's my order:  and don't think i'm a heffer, I did say it's far right?  I had to try EVERYTHING while I could.  So I did.  :P  
They start you off w/ Salsa and Guac-

Fusion Bulgogi Fries:
Meat, Mozzarella Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapeno & Spicy Korean Hot Sauce-  
DUDE.  yes.  it's ALL of that... and more.   like, I could've just walked out w/ ALL that in my belly... but of course I ordered more.  It's good.  Lots of meat, and a very large plate full.  

I had 3 tacos!  1 of each! pork, chicken, beef! fusion tacos Dak-gogi tacos-were my fav of the 3 marinated tacos: Flour Tortilla with Lettuce, Pico de Gallo, Sour Cream -- DROOL.  I love tacos.  like, my 5th love.  

We also had Kim Chee Fried Rice..... YUM!  I make a pretty mean fried rice... so this... is ooooookaaaaaaay....  It's a little oily, but still very yummy. 

You know what, to be honest with you I don't remember what they had... and it doesn't even matter because I requested we go there this night.  And I was very happy.... I think they were too.  ?  Idk. but I was.  and when mommys happy... everyone's happy."}
{"text":"Komex is such a great spot to get some Korean / Mexican fusion food.  I tried three different tacos ( Korean fusion beef spicy taco, fish fusion taco and the Mexican asada steak taco) . The food was delicious and the service was prompt. I have a feeling I will go there often."}
{"text":"We drove all the way here from Southwest Las Vegas because we expected good food with almost 5 stars in Yelp. We were disappointed. 

We ordered the Bulgogi Burrito and the Pork Belly Musubi. 

The bulgogi in the burrito doesn't taste like the regular stand alone bulgogi we get from restos. It's lacking in taste. My boyfriend compared it to regular carne asada.

As for the musubi, there's more rice than the pork belly, and the pork belly is not tasty enough to overcome the quantity of rice inside the musubi. 

The service is ok. It was funny to see the server and a customer argue about \"Asian hot sauce\". 

All in all, I expected better. Greatly disappointed."}
{"text":"As a former-local, this is hands down my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Family-owned and made to order, you can taste the care out into the food. My recommendation is to order from the fusion part of the menu as opposed to the just Korean or Mexican parts though there isn't much you won't love on the menu. The fusion burrito is my go-to and a crowd pleaser. This place is good for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"I've never had korean mexican fusion before.  It's an interesting concept.  I had some burritos and nachos.  Food was decent. Service was ok.  Overall a 3."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I had same menu at other location and other one was better taste. I tried pork belly musubi for the first time and there was way too much rice and not enough sauce. Kimchi bulgogi fried rice had no flavor it was just really red but not spicy. Taco was ok bulgogi fries little bit sweeter than i would like."}
{"text":"Love this place... If your looking for something new gotta try the bulgogi tacos, fusion lettuce wraps and all the burritos are killer good!! I definitely recommend this place highly!! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very small store front, looks like a hole in the wall greasy spoon but acts like a mid range place. Prices were not bad. I would not do nachos again, very dry and bottom chips were bare. Salsa mixes were on point."}
{"text":"The food was average for me and my husband. He had the bulgogi plate and I had the spicy pork plate. It was just ok, the rice was a little dry and the meat was just ok."}
{"text":"Picked up a Vegas weekly mag and it highlighted this place for its Nachos. Next day I checked it out for myself. Bulgogi nachos/fries are legit...can't go wrong."}
{"text":"K.O. turned me on to this place as she knows I love korean food and mexican food.

I had the Pork Belly Chimichanga with pork belly. This was melt in your mouth good.  The outside was crispy and flakey just how a chimichanga should be. the inside was seasoned well and there was no shortage of meat. The top of the chimichanga was drenched in a delicious sauce along with melted shredded cheese, some lettuce and pico de gallo.

I highly recommend the chimichanga here. Only thing that sucks is that the oil eventually hardens the bottom of the chimichanga crust and makes it difficult to cut."}
{"text":"So Delicious. First time trying komex fusion food. It's such a great combination. Definitely give it a try. You won't be disappointed!! 
We had the fusion tacos, traditional bulgogi with rice and a fusion bowl with tater tots and pork belly. All were fantastic."}
{"text":"The food was aqesome and the server guy was on top of things. The Korean and Mexican cultures seemed to get along well in my stomach."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place!! My co-workers and I eat here about at least twice a week. We work close by so this is our to go place! Linda is amazing and friendly! Highly recommend their pork bulgogi lettuce wrap and pork bbq skewer!! I would eat here every day if I could"}
{"text":"My favorite type of fusion food is no doubt Korean and Mexican! The bulgogi burrito (with added kimchi) at KoMex was tasty.  The burrito was tightly packed with ingredients evenly distributed. Each bite was very satisfying with a good amount of bulgogi, mexican rice, cilantro, onions, etc. Their hot sauce rack has a variety of hot sauce with different flavor and spiciness level which makes it very fun to try. 

We also tried the spam musubi and pork belly musubi. The musubi are on the thin side and with less rice than the ones I usually have. Nothing too special about these two. The complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole was very nice. And service was attentive and friendly. I'd be back!"}
{"text":"This place has the kimchi fusion burritos I literally dream about. Once you have them, all other burritos will feel incomplete!!

This is one of my top places in Vegas. It's a little hidden gem of a place where you can get food unlike anywhere else that will tantalize your taste buds and not break your wallet."}
{"text":"I had the flu when i hate their nachos and they were still SO good. All my meat eating friends wouldn't stop talking about how good the food was and how awesome the meat was. When i placed my order the girl on the phone was a bit rude when i asked them to put the meat on the side of my nachos(\"we don't do that here\") But they did and I'll totally be returning. Awesome food with a great concept!"}
{"text":"The outside of the building and the location are not ideal and the inside is quite small. However, the food is very good and we will be visiting again. They have a sign up that lets you know they don't consider themselves fast food and every order is made fresh so they ask you to be patient. They also mention you are allowed to call ahead to order if you are short on patience. With that being said it appears they meant it as our food tasted very fresh. Now on top of their flavorful meat and well made dishes the simple creativity in fusing the 2 styles of food are why i gave it a 5 star instead of a 4 star. Their customer service seems to be in order at least it was when i went."}
{"text":"Yum.  Hubby and I were both full for dinner for $15.  Everything we ordered was good.  Explore and enjoy!"}
{"text":"So bomb!! Came across this place via yelp (thanks Yelp!) and it's the perfect combination of Korean and Mexican fusion. Our waiter was super nice and gave us the lowdown on the place and owner

The food is amazing, definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"First time trying out this place! A bit disappointed because the spam musubi does NOT have eggs on them anymore  I was looking forward to that after seeing past photos uploaded by other Yelp users.. I also got Jim's beef fried rice. It was alright. Not awesome or anything."}
{"text":"First time having Fusion Korean Mexican and it A-MAZING!! I think we sampled a little of everything for first timers but I recommend the Bulgogi Taco's and Fries..."}
{"text":"Great prices and great food!!! The meats are delicious and they have some creative ideas which made the food delicious and fun. The service was also excellent, our server (possibly the owner) was working hard tending to all of her tables and making sure everything was going good at our table, I was VERY impressed. Had a little trouble finding KoMex but its located in the small shopping center next to Winchells. Thanks KoMex, you have the key to sucess which is great food, great prices, and great service!"}
{"text":"I am korean and i have heard about this place from many of my friends. I had to try while I was in vegas and I loved it!!!! I love mexican food and combination was awesome. Their spicy pork tacos were good and fries were huge! must share!"}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy Komex. My girl dragged me here after a day full of errands, so I already wasn't in the mood to flip the coin in hopes of a good meal. We ordered a burrito and some nachos. The portions were really big and cheap, but I just didn't like the food. Too many combinations of flavors. I just didn't like having so many strong flavors all fighting for attention. I probably won't be back to give them another try."}
{"text":"This place sooooooo good !!! I can't wait to come back to vegas just to eat here!! I was here 10/3/2013 I got the 2 meat burrito i chose the bulgogi and pork belly burrito omg sooooo good with their medium hot hot sauce ...I got the spicy Korean BBQ pork cheese steak sandwich OMG soooo good :-) love it !! Thank you to the owners they are great and oh so nice :-)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite terrible to its taste in atmosphere and I will never return to this place and general."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas to hang for a couple of days with my son. We got burned out on the strip and Yelped Mexican, found KoMex, grabbed the car and drove right over - TOTALLY worth the drive! I had the fusion fish tacos and my son got the bulgogi burrito - for 20 years I've been on the hunt for the best fish taco and I think I found it at KoMex - I also ordered a half order of kimchi fried rice but they brought me a full order by mistake - oops - I had to leave with the other half to take home but they only charged me half (!) great food great service and great prices I wish I could take this great little hole-in-the-wall treasure home to San Jose with me..."}
{"text":"Komex is amazing. You must get the flautas with spicy guacamole and the pork belly musubi is to die for."}
{"text":"Good value for the amount of food they give here and overall tasty. I got the bulgogi burrito and it was delicious, although I would have liked a little more seasoning in the burrito as it was more bland then I would have liked. I also had a taco and I think I would just order tacos here in the future since they seem to be more flavorful. The tacos were difficult to eat because they piled on so many ingredients, but I definitely liked the volume of food that was given."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bulgogi rice and the carne asada burrito. Super pissed because the rice was not as described.  See the phot of the menu-when I called the gal said the sunny side up egg was at an additional cost.  I called ahead and she had described the entrees, but there was a language barrier. When I called back to tell her that it wasn't explained as it was on the menu, she was rude and condescending, so I didn't appreciate that either. I was a bit apprehensive to try this place because it was so empty at lunch and the food took so long.  I called ahead too.  
The carne asada burrito had beans like-pork and beans and it was mushy and tasted sweet. 
I think fusion for some foods are great but the fact is, some things shouldn't happen. This place is that."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious and the prices a very cheap. We saw this place in yelp and I knew I had to have it. The first time there we ordered the fusion tacos and the fusion tostadas which are made with rice patties. Both of these items tasted heavenly and we have definitely been back to that place time and time again. If you are a food fanatic this is the place for you. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Always awesome, comfort food at its best. Warm reception and great service. If you can't find anything on the menu you must be dead. Great prices and tons of great tasting food we grew up eating. One of the many hidden treasures in town."}
{"text":"Mind is completely blown. Korean, Mexican, Chinese fusion?? HELL YEAH!

I found this little place randomly on our way out of Vegas after a weekend trip. I searched yelp by check in offers because I was feeling cheap after losing all my money on the strip. KoMex came up, and we were sold. In fact, we waited in the parking lot for over an hour until they opened just so we could try it. 

We over-ordered and everything was so inexpensive. I had the shrimp stir fry, my boyfriend had the bulgogi nachos, my friend had kimchi fried rice and they ordered a bulgogi burrito with kimchi as well. Everything I tried was amazing. I ordered a double order of kimchi on the side and greedilt gobbled it up in less than a minute.

The people working there were super nice and the food came out quickly. Plus, free wontons when you check in. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Pretty good fusion place. I usually stay clear of fusion place but Korean Mexican interested me.  I got the tostada with pork. Pretty unique.  It was a rice cake topped with spicy pork and in house slaw. It wasn't too big so you won't become crazy full with it.  Wife got the standard bulgulgi which was tasty. 
Wife got the pork belly masubi. Belly was salty which was wrapped around rice. It worked pretty nice. I would go back."}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5.  I was going to put 4 stars for the chicken fusion flautas I got but I have to take 0.5 off because I found a toothpick in it.  Apparently it was there to keep the flautas rolled and it was not taken out properly.  The manager did take off the $8 from the total of the check though.

Other than that, it seemed to be a popular place at lunch.  There was even a reserved sign on one of the back tables."}
{"text":"A hidden gem amongst the bright lights and big, expensive city of Las Vegas! This was something I've never tried before... Korean/Mexican fusion? What? You've got to be kidding, right? Nope! And I'm glad others reviews helped to steer us to this WONDERFUL place during our stay in Vegas. I could only wish that we had found it sooner! 

I had the fusion tacos -  Bulgogi beef. $1.29 each.... and worth twice that! They state they're small... but, these pack a mega punch! Soft flavorful beef....the sweet cabbage... the tasty corn tortilla... HEAVEN.

My hubby also enjoyed his meal. He went with the 2 meat combo plate. Bulgogi beef and Dak-gogi chicken. He was only sad that he couldn't finish it all! (and we had no place to heat it up and store it for leftovers in our hotel :(  super sad).

And the fried wontons? A definite must! Try them! I mean, they're only a dollar for goodness sakes!

We came out of there content and stuffed! And, our bill only came to around $20 for everything! (including our passion fruit mango iced teas! yum!)

Last, but not least, the people working there were so polite and gave excellent service. Even while visiting at prime lunch time with a packed house!

I WILL be visiting again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very much a hole in the wall. Very unique and very good. I ordered 3 different types of fusion tacos and all of them came out really good. I'm very big on vegetables and those were loaded with cabbage, tomatoes and etc. Very good. Prices are reasonable. Would recommend."}
{"text":"The Skinny: tried their beef, chicken, pork belly, fish taco - would only recommend getting 1 out of 4 (3) Service: good and prompt (3) Value: given we'd only order 1 dish out of four again, I think we'll pass on this (3).

I'd been wanting to try this place out for a while given everything that I've read and heard about this place. Finally, they opened a location close by my hood? Game on.

So we ordered their beef, chicken, pork belly and fish fusion tacos to start.

We were served up the complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole which was decidedly meh. I forgot to take a picture of the guacamole but it was brown and relatively bland. The salsa was alright but nothing special. The chips were clearly their homestyle fried corn tortillas which were overly thick and greasy.

The fusion tacos we ordered were quite filling and the serving size is quite large. All the tacos were topped with shredded cabbage and tomatoes (FYI, I thought the tomatoes rather flavorless pale beefsteak tomatoes - not a of which I was not a fan.) There was a little too little meat per veggie ratio in the taco for my tastes.

The fish in the fish tacos had a really tough coating on it and missing a nice light sauce on top to tie everything together. I found it overall to be too dry.

The pork belly and the chicken tacos were okay - both had a hit of smokiness however they were oddly underseasoned for Korean food. I expected big flavor hits of chili paste and sesame oils... which weren't there.

The best thing we tried was the bulgogi taco which was good - it was seasoned right and had a good amount of grilled flavor to it.

Overall, given that we only really thought 1 dish was good out of 4, I think we'll pass on this place even though we were glad to finally check out what all the fuss was about (3 starred review)."}
{"text":"I got the Fusion Shrimp Enchilada and the combination fried rice!! The Fusion Shrimp Enchilada was off the chain!! It's going to be hard to try a different dish my next time there!! The combination fried rice was good also."}
{"text":"I wasn't looking for any mexican food on this vegas trip. I'm from los angeles; mexican food is everywhere, but with the korean/mexican fusion, I was really interested in coming here. Well, I loved it!! Wish there was one in LA!

Came and ordered the bulgogi tots. My boyfriend got the bulgogi nachos/fries combo and we shared some pork belly musubi.

Delicious delicious delicious! My boyfriend and I agreed that the bulgogi tater tots stole the show. Cheesy, crunchy and super tasty!! With green onions and sour cream. Yummy! I love musubi, but never tried pork belly musubi before; it was damn good and they make them pretty big too.

Complimentary chips, salsa and guac. Guacamole was also delicious. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"AMAZING.....This is the word I have to use for this place. I love Korean BBQ and I was amazed to see that they came up with this fusion concept to have taco's with Korean BBQ. 

And the price was cherry on the top..."}
{"text":"My hubby and I loved this place. The bulgogi fried rice was awesome.  Since we moved to the area we have been searching for good beef bulgogi.  We finally found it here.   The tacos, burritos and fries were also fantastic.  It is definitely worth the trip to that part of town.  We will be back many, many times."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to see how awesome this place is. I have got to say, the service is outstanding.  I came in during after lunch hours and the place was fairly empty.  So I got served well.  
What I had: I ordered the half order of bulgogi fries and the kimchi fried rice with egg.  When she brought out my fries, the cheese on it was great.  The quality of the cheese is of course better than average because when I pull a few fries out, the cheese actually streches out instead of snapping on instance.  The bulgogi meat in the fries were delicious, not hard as a rock like some places that make terrible carne asada.  Good thing I ordered a half because it was very huge.  The kimchi fried rice was a full size dish.  I have got to say, it was very different.  The flavor was light and not overpowering.  The meat, was of course the same as the fries.. GOOD.  

I have got say, that the pricing is very decent for the portion.  The service is excellent because when I asked for a togo box, she brought me my box and half an orange already sliced up.  Always nice to have something that's like a dessert.  BONUS.  I noticed they had all the condiments up front (Tapatio, different hot sauces, etc.).  She also brought it out with my fries.  

I WILL come back, just sadden that it's far out of my way.  Place also accepts AMERICAN EXPRESS!.. Whoo! Parking is might be a drag at certain times since it's a shared lot with other stores."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch yesterday. The server explained and suggested the menu. I had a pork burrito... it was outstanding. The blend of flavors was, literally, a party in my mouth. And the prices were excellent. I loved it. Definitely going back. SOON!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The food is always delicious. You get some chips, salsa, and guacamole for free to munch on while you wait for the food to come out. The food comes out so quick, it's awesome. The service is always excellent. No matter how busy the place is the service never seems to fall short, especially since there are only 1-2 servers. 

I always order the fusion burrito with beef and kimchi, mouthwatering deliciousness! I think the main star are the pork belly's on a stick. I promise you will not regret it if you order this. Who doesn't like pork belly?! 

We will definitely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim - was looking for somewhere to eat and found this place on Yelp.  Korean and Mexican are two food types I'd never have imagined worked well together, but they do!  Would definitely recommend the pork belly fusion fries (something like that - not the nachos, but the french fry nachos with pork belly.)  We got the fries/nachos combination and the fry side just seemed to work/taste better (also, FYI, this combination is HUGE - great for sharing!).  I'd also recommend the calamari fusion tacos - again, wasn't sure what to expect, and it blew my mind!  Prices are reasonable, service is a little slow so not really good if you're on a time limit, but definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We didn't know where to eat in Vegas (I know there are so many places to eat), and my brother-in-law suggested this place. A little drive from the strip but WOW was it worth it.

We started off with the wonton style tortilla chips. These aren't your normal tortilla chips, but they come with salsa and guacamole. Our party ordered bulgogi burritos, bulgogi tacos and chicken chow fun. All were amazing. The bulgogi burritos are a MUST! The bulgogi is cooked well and is complemented nicely with the sweet and hot sauce. Kristina ordered the bulgogi tacos and they were better than any bulgogi tacos that we've had. Make sure to try the bulgogi if you go. You won't regret it.

The biggest plus of this place is the PRICE! For 4 plates our dinner was under $30!!!!! Yeah, $30 big ones and we were all stuffed after. Totally worth the drive from the strip but be forewarned, this place is small. The staff is extremely friendly and kept checking up on us throughout our meal. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but I just don't get it. Yes, it is fusion but it maybe my taste buds or the things are made. 

Walked into the door, and yes, the service was exceptional. Greeted right away and sat right down. 

Ordered their tacos: beef, chicken and pork belly; & nachos with spicy pork. I have to admit, it's kinda weird because I'm used to eating Korean food -- Korean way not mixed with Mexican.

I do have to admint that the pork belly is worth getting. 

One more thing, this place has an odd smell. Maybe it's their cleaning supplies? Just cleaned the area where I sat?"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years. There was a point in time where this place was almost a weekly must have due to craving it's deliciousness so badly. My absolute favorite was the bulgogi beef burrito and fried wontons. My boyfriend loves the spicy pork enchiladas. 

However, the last few times I have gotten food from here which were spread far apart, it has been a disappointment. I definitely see a lack in not only meat in my burrito but also flavor! My last burrito was so stuffed with overcooked/watery rice that I didn't even eat the whole thing. The beef was scarce and so bland when I could find bits. 

This really saddens me bc this place was something I could really count on for a quality meal and now I don't know when I'll go back if ever."}
{"text":"I met one of the owners , she was very welcoming and has a great smile. The fish taco was tasty, so was the spicy pork taco
I dined in, so received the chips salsa and Guacamole all very good. The owner gave me a free second helping of the Guac and a free sample bowl of a seafood soup they are experimenting with and thinking of selling, it had kimchee and seafood lt was like a fusion of Mexican seven seas and spicy cabbage soup my tasty buds where whirling in confusion hehe."}
{"text":"Dubbed as our Vegas weekend cheap eat, the marriage of Mexican and Korean was a good concept that suffered from poor execution. Komex is located in a strip mall and is a bit of a hole in the wall with paper napkin drawings taped to the wall and a dark, dirty water? line that made its way along the wall, counter, buckets, etc. The floor is chipped and dated as is much of the remaining decor.

But hey, I came here for the food right? We ordered a few beef bulgogi tacos, a few pork bulgogi tacos, the half order of loaded fries, and a chimichanga to split for two. We received complimentary chips with guac and salsa. Chips were oily and needed salt, guac was quite bland, and salsa not memorable. The tacos were the highlight of the meal albeit a bit messy. Fries were super soggy and execution of the dish was straight up poor. The chimichanga was equally as meh that we left half of it untouched. Of the beef, pork, and chicken bulgogi meats we tried, chicken was the worst.

Good for a cheap eat that is not Chipotle or Taco Bell, but not worthy of the accolades it has received. Cash money = 5% off."}
{"text":"Love the bulgogi fries I am addicted!  Also the tacos and the flautas are really good too!  Great mix of both types of foods."}
{"text":"Another great visit.  They food is always fresh and good.  I do prefer the other location but no biggy.  Nice staff."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  As the other people has posted your portions are HUGE, have great flavor and is really cheap.  The wife and I went here and had the fusion tacos.  I got the pork and it had awesome flavor (in tortilla).  She got chicken in lettuce and it was a little bland but I added some of the red chili paste and it was great.  They served us chips and salsa and the salsa was pretty good too.  The chips were crispy and soggy at the same time.  Some people like this, I don't really as they are chewy.  The fried wontons were good also, but not as good as being in Korea and getting yakimando.  The bulgogi was HUGE and AWESOME.  The total bill was 20 bucks and we took more than 1/2 home.  I asked Linda if the wonton was like yaki and she picked up that I had been to Korea before and offered some kimchi.  She said it's not on the menu but it is there if you want it.  It was good and you could tell it had some bubbly fermentation to it."}
{"text":"Boom! This place is quite the discovery. So I had it bookmarked for awhile and I am really glad I finally got to try it. We arrived right before the lunch rush and when I say rush the place was packed when we left. No real motif to the place, more just like a local bar/restaurant with simple tables and no hostess. I love these types of places! We were greeted as we walked in and seated right away. 

So the food is a mix of Mexican and Korean, two foods I really do enjoy so I was excited. We tried the dak bulgogi tacos with lettuce, the bulgogi bowl with fried eggs, spam masubi and the pork belly masubi with a fried egg. All of it.....amazing! 

The masubis were a large portion and a definite reason to go back. Definitely recommend this delicious spot!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place and wanted to try it out. 
Pineapple soju was great!!!! The chips n salsa with Guac is decent. Food was mediocre we ordered fusion tacos chix, bulgogi& spicy pork (these were my fav) kimchi bugulgi burrito ( this was so-so not that flavorful the meat tastes like its left soaking in sauce prior to serving it) pork belly masubi with egg added ( my husbands liked it. It had no flavor at all it was very bland )  bugulgi fries with fries extra crispy this was meh..... There were 3 of us and we all agreed we won't be craving this or care to come back for this food. What a bummer"}
{"text":"Ko-mex definitely lived up to its expectations. The fusion tacos in the fusion tostada was definitely satisfying. We also shared that half-and-half nacho fries with the fusion beef as well definitely coming. Our service was very good waitress everyone was very friendly"}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered a bulgogi or pork burrito, forgot which and two fusion tacos! Both were  tasty and a small nice local vibe to the place. 

Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"The original KoMex location is one of my favourite places to go in the city for delicious eats and friendly service.  This new location is larger and shinier than the original and boasts a bar!  (No drink menu yet though.)  There was even a large, flat-screen TV in the bar area, conveniently situated for those wanting to watch the current sports game whilst enjoying KoMex's fusion delights.  I DID find it odd that there was a large empty space in front of the entrance.  Perhaps the restaurant's order for more tables and chairs was exceptionally tardy?

I'm glad to report that the food is still as yummy as found at the original KoMex.  Service is still friendly, but my server must have been new, because she was on the slow side in responding to requests (we wanted condiments and utensils!).   We still received our free chips/salsa/guacamole and the dessert orange and prices, while slightly higher than in early 2013, are still very reasonable.

All in all, I'm glad there is a second location on the west side, as that is evidence that the owners are doing well!"}
{"text":"Service: The owner was very sweet and attentive. I ordered the kimchi fried rice w/o eggs; when it came out I noticed it had small pieces of what I thought may have been eggs in the mix. I let her know I am allergic to eggs and she gladly took it back to make sure that it was made w/o eggs and reassured me that a new one would be made. The chef came out and confirmed that there were no eggs in the fried rice... so I dug in. It was delicious. so flavorful. and exploding w. kimchi!! 

I also got the free fried wontons for the check in special on yelp. The owner returned to inform me that the wontons were sealed w/ egg yolk. This just showed me how attentive she was! thumbs up to that. 

Boyfriend got the soft tacos in pork, chicken, and beef. The chicken taco was delicious!! It had different dressings than that of a tacoshop ie cabbage. 

I was really skept about trying this restaurant when my boyfriend suggested it. But it completely opened my mind to fusion food. I've had other fusion foods in San Diego which did not compared!! Will definitely be going back! I love it when hole in the wall restaurants blow you away like this one (:"}
{"text":"I love this place. I go to it whenever I want to get something to snack on. I really like how affordable they are and have great quality food."}
{"text":"We found this place via yelp and didn't know what to expect. We walked in the door and found a good size line and little seating, which didn't bode well for my wife and I as she was 9 months pregnant, but out of sheer kindness this couple Rachael her husband two kids and her sister asked us to join them at a thier  table and eat with them, my wife didn't hesitate. We place our order and proceed to have a great time talking with out table mates, and drooling over what they ordered. After a while our order arrived, steaming hot and excellent, I ordered the combo bulgogi (chicken & pork) WOW it had the perfect amount of spice (for me) and both the chicken and pork we moist and tender, my wife's fusion tacos were equally good,again the beef and chicken were moist, tender, a perfectly cooked. After we said good bye to the very kind couple, the owner came out (she took our order) and asked how our meal was, and apologized for the wait, to which myself and my wife told her not to apologize at all everything was wonderful and that we had an amazing time. Overall the experience was outstanding, the food excellent the price point spot on and to the couple that let us sit with them THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning too come check out KoMex for awhile now. Or could say all the times been too babystack cafe located in the same shopping plaza keep thinking too myself need too try KoMex the next day. Well I finally got around too it.  

It was a mixed experience or really one not very star any worthy dish and then one that was home run. I came for lunch. The house chips and salsa/guacamole talk about great start too any meal of the day. The salsa was really nice not too spicy but still had a nice little kick too it. The guacamole was awesome! The chips was crispy, hot, and really could tell fresh tortilla they fried off. The seasoning on the chips was spot on too. Just make sure not too overload on them. Or just cave in too the addiction that once get one need another and another...

I ordered two dishes the fusion sliders and the kim chee fried rice. The fusion slider for me not fan of at all. The bulgogi meat that was awesome had really nice flavor, moist, and could have had whole plate just the meat. I felt like  it failed especially came too the slider buns. It was little bigger then normal slider buns. I felt with every bite was eating more bread then the whole compliment of bulgogi and the topping too the hot sauce inside the slider. The bun by itself was very bland and sandwich not sandwich if your bread all out of whack too start. Where the fusion sliders not the best thing on the menu. Once I got too try the kim chee fried rice with spam and topped with fried egg. Back in my Happy place with food. The spam goes really well with the kim chee make nice balance of flavors and fried egg on anything easy sold on that idea. I love me some fried egg. 

The portion sizes are decent size as are the prices. Most of the entrees all under $10 or not many that recall that went over that amount. The service was great, friendly, suggested spam with my fried rice (I was going in different direction but always trust the servers recommendation?), and very attentive making sure everything was ok. 

Although it was hit and miss. KoMex definitely place come back too try more of the menu. Not only reasonable price, good food, and even better close too the house!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food but the service is just okay. I had to wait a long time for water but it was worth it for the delicious bulgogi tacos"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after a recommendation from a friend. I ordered a beef fusion burrito (no pico). First of all, the burrito was HUGE! All ingredients tasted very fresh. It was delicious. I can't wait to come back and try something else. Highly recommended. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"this must be what peer pressure feels like without actually having the pressure directly upon you.
i feel like i HAVE TO write a good review of this place just because everyone else has.
i'm so afraid that i may get slammed by the komex police or something!

i had heard about this place from many fellow yelpers and read all the glowing reviews and so decided to give it a go.
i knew, full well, that i was going in with expectations through the roof.
unfortunately, what i expected and what i actually received were 2 entirely different things.
i definitely feel that my opinion is a little skewed by my anticipation of having a mind blowing experience.
therefore, i will give it 4 stars on the basis that my experience would have been significantly better had i not walked in expecting myself to find the meaning of life in one of these tacos.

on my first visit, i had the tofu fusion taco, the stir fried fettucine and the spicy seafood stir fry.
the hubby had the bulgogi taco sampler and the bulgogi french fries.
on my second visit, i had the tofu enchilada platter and the hubby had the same bulgogi tacos.

the tacos were, without a doubt, outstandingly tasty.
it amazes me that tofu can actually deliver so much flavor but, somehow, the folks at komex have figured it out.
the enchilada i had was on the same level as the tacos.
really tasty for having no meat substance of any kind involved.
i absolutely love the complimentary chips, salsa and guac.
i could eat bags of those.
the bulgogi fries are heart attack inducing goodness.

as for the rest of the food, i'd have to say they were pedestrian at best.
i'm not a fan of the stir fry fettucine.
if i'm gonna have asian style noodles, i'd like them to be cooked with asian noodles.
the spicy seafood stir fry seemed to be made with the bag of frozen seafood you find at any asian supermarket - chewy and flavorless.
definitely something anyone can make at home.

BUT...the tacos and essentially everything on the left side of the menu were totally worth going back for again.
we even brought some friends from out of town to give them a try and they loved their tacos.
so, i'll definitely continue to dine here if i'm in that neck of the woods but i'll be sure to stick to the left half of the menu."}
{"text":"I strongly recommend the bulgogi tacos and bulgogi burrito. The meat is perfectly marinated and the fusion style blends everything with perfection. And the house blend hot sauce (there are Kim chi bits in it) is a must-try - not too hot but very flavorful. They even give you an orange as dessert! Great price point, amazing service, basically this place is flawless."}
{"text":"Love this place. We go every week. 

Cheap Eats, Great food, Great service. You can't ask for more! 

Their kimchi is great ! I have it on everything. I always tend to try something new here everytime I go but, the tacos are still my fav. Love the house salsas and hot sauces !"}
{"text":"Easy to get to location, great tasting food and very friendly service.   I ordered the Bulgagi plate with rice and Korean wings.   Definitely a great place to go.   Saw the Fusion Burrito delivered to a table and WOW, great.  They also have a Happy Hour from 3 - 6 pm for beer/wine.  Will have to check that out!!"}
{"text":"First time going off the strip to go eat dinner. Very interesting mix of Korean food and Mexican food. I guess it works . I tried their fusion Flautas. First time every trying it but hey!~~~ it was pretty good. My friend told me its just usually just cheese and no meat but they added bul gogi meat in it. Pretty good~! 

Service was good. Everyone's really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Korean food and Mexican food?! The Fusion bulgogi burrito is awesome! You got to try the Fusion philly bulgogi because your taste buds will thank you later! Always a great experience when coming in here with great food and wonderful customer service!"}
{"text":"We drove from Huntington Beach, CA to try the food at KoMex and I have to tell you that the drive was worth it!  Everything we order was awesome.  The prices were very reasonable.  The service was wonderful and we got our food quickly.  I highly recommend KoMex Fusion Express!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'd been hearing about this place for years, but only recently got to try it. The food was delicious!  I could eat it everyday! 
I had a couple tacos and a buogogi bowl, my fiancé had a toastada and some soju.
Everything was so flavorful and decently priced. Definitely going to be a regular stop now."}
{"text":"Great place with a very interesting fusion! I love Korean and Mexican food and this place nails that fusion. A must place to try if you are interested in something different."}
{"text":"When I first heard about this, Korean and Mexican Fusion, my first thought was \"wha?!\" with just a hint of skepticism (just a hint).

BUT, since I considered myself open-minded and I'm easily swayed by many, MANY good reviews from friends and yelpers, I became more excited to try this place. I mean, come on - bulgogi in a burrito with kimchi? That sounds pretty tasty! Besides, I love Seoul Food. =)

KoMex isn't too big, but luckily they had a booth that accommodated me and my 5 other friends. There were 3 guys and 3 gals. The guys and myself each ordered a burrito, while the girls ordered tacos. We also ordered some fried wontons (4 for a buck!)

I was clearly very hungry and thought I might be able to finish my food. I didn't stand a chance. I ate about 2/3 of the burrito, a couple of chips and guac, a wonton and waved a white flag. 

The wontons are ok, but for a $1, definitely not disappointed. The burrito was SO GOOD! There was a good amount of meat and if you get kimchi (which I suggest you do if you like it), the burrito is just HUGE! I want to say it was the size of my forearm. Considering I'm petite in the sense that I'm short with short limbs, I think that's a pretty accurate description.

Everyone left stuffed and happy. If you are in the area and want to try some off the strip joints, you should stop on by."}
{"text":"Great local eatery. Close to home. Korean-Mexican fuse dishes. Very clever, you get best of both worlds in one bite. Service was great & the staff was very friendly. The waitress was attentive to everyone dining there. Two thumbs for service!! The food was amazing. Complimentary chips and salsa while you wait for your food. They also give you half an orange after your meal. The food was amazing, we ordered the bulgogi tater tots, bulgogi rice bowl & carne asada burrito. We killed it, licked the plate clean and the bill came out to about 28$. Highly recommended. I'll take my friends from out of town here for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant.  For a really small place they had great service.  The waitress checked in on my 3 times which was awesome.  I got the beef bowl.  It was great but i mainly tasted the Asian side rather than the Mexican side. Overall i wish there was one closer to me but it is definitely worth the 35 minute drive."}
{"text":"ate at koemx last year and made sure we would eat here again this year, we are from hawaii, so day after thanksgiving we had lunch here, last year it was a smaller location this is a larger restaurant they have two locations.  The fusion of korean and mexican is so genious they complement each other so well.  we had spicy pork, kim chee tacos, a large burrito with everything in it and the best nachos ever
and side orders of kim chee.  please open one up in hawaii so we dont have to long for the food all year.  this place is really a must try, we were served by the owner herself, the service was quick, clean, and prices reasonable, especially the portions are so large, you can try a variety of things and your bill will still be affordable, oh also tacos are only 2.00 dollars and you can have it with kim chee delicious.

hawaii people you will love this place it really reminds you of the cooking we are accustomed to here in the islands a real melting pot of different ethnic cooking,  just so comfy and delicious"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews and pictures we couldn't wait to check this place out! I love Asian fusion type restaurants since there are so many choices to eat that are pretty unique. We got there and sat down promptly. Our waitress was super nice and gave us suggestions and explanations for some menu items :) 
I settled on getting the bulgogi fried rice and the pork belly musubi with fried egg (which cost extra for some reason?). My husband got the bulgogi cheese steak sandwich and my friend got the teriyaki chicken with rice.
My friend rice was so so good! The half portion is huge for being half and the bulgogi had good flavors. My husband's sandwich was the winner though. The bulgogi was marinated really well and the cheese and meat combo was fantastic. The pork belly I was alittle disappointed with. It was a bit dry and wasn't seasoned as well as the other items. Over the pork belly musubi was okay (need a sauce or something). My friend liked her chicken teriyaki as well. Overall it was a pleasant experience with good food for a good price ! If we are ever back in town we will def. Come back here :)"}
{"text":"I got food to go and had a DELICIOUS bibimbop bowl! Portions are big and the price is just right. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at the original location at least a dozen times, but never tried the shrimp fusion taco - until today. The shrimp quality is amazing, almost lobster-like & not 'watery' like cocktail shrimp. 

My favorite house salsa is the bright red one with green onions in it. Perfect medium-hot heat. I put at least 1 ounce of it on each taco.

Reasonably-priced, and incredibly nice service. Not exactly a great date spot or a place to impress your in-laws - just creative, quality food served up with love. Nothing wrong with that!"}
{"text":"The place is a whole in the wall but the service and food was excellent. Had the fried rice and it had a very good flavor. The fusion between Mexican and Korean was genius. Excellent for lunch time"}
{"text":"This place is honestly the greatest thing ever. They have amazing food, and the staffs are really friendly. 
My favorite thing on there is their Kim chi fried rice, I get it with spam. I got the full portion which is $10.81 after tax. I love it so much. It's a really good deal if you get half portion bc the portion is still big but it's still really good. I do think that it is a little over price for just fried rice but again, you have to pay a little more for good food. 
The parking situation is a bit ridiculous bc they're in a small plaza and have to share with other ppl. I also had their bulgogi nachos. It is to die for. 
I definitely recommend the fried rice and nachos if you do get anything. You can tell it's a family own restaurant which feels a little more welcoming. 
Overall great place and food. Just a little overpriced but well worth it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I def taste the fusion of Mexican and Korean. Flautas were bomb.com. Service-fast especially since it was busy. One of the servers was a little bit aggressive and felt she rushed us, after it, it was our first time. I def will come back."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews from Yelp we have decided to give it a try for lunch today. Honestly speaking, I am disappointed by the experience.

Most of the reviews I have read are talking about the taste of the food is so good with a very cheap price. I guess since I did not order the taco, I've become the exception. What I had was a Bulgogi plate, which is basically half white rice with half ground beef. The portion is decent, I think I would be full if I could finish it. However, the taste of the beef is dry and salty, it might work when you put them into a taco, but not on the white rice, this is simply wrong. I wish they at least put some cooked onion to blend in a little bit of sweetness, but there was none. The full size Bulgogi plate is $9.

I hope when a restaurant put some items like Bulgogi plate on their menu, they really meant for it."}
{"text":"New KoMex location. Same very delicious KoMex food. 

If you haven't tried KoMex yet get down to this location or the original location ASAP. I hated the long almost 1 hr waits at the other location on some days. Yes it's that good. So I'm very happy this one finally opened up. Korean Mexican fusion is an excellent combination. I ordered their Fusion Burrito, my usual order, and inhaled that sucker like I was in a pie eating contest. Why waste time eating 1 yummy thing when I could eat 2 yummy things, didn't do 2 but wanted to. The one thing that you must do is add lots and lots of their hot sauces on anything you get it's a big difference maker but in moderations. I almost ate all 4 of the containers of sauce on my own. It's very good. They should bottle them cause I might want to take some home.

Their fusion tacos, burritos, nachos, fries, etc are served with various meats like spicy pork, pork belly, chicken, and more all come with a Korean/Mexican twist. Even their cheese steak was different, using bulgogi. Check out the pictures and reviews at the original location it will pretty much tell you wassup.

I enjoyed the customer service friendly, complementary chips, salsa, guacamole, fortune cookies, and oranges to end the meal. They were still finishing up construction and decorating, fine tuning things like only cash at the time, 1 out of the 6 menu books at our table was without a menu inside, and temp banner outside but things are looking good. Seems like more space for more seats and even a bar area. I'll probably be back before the weeks over. No I will definitely be back before the weeks over.

Located in the same plaza as BabyStacks Cafe and Hikari SW Buffalo and Flamingo.

Did I mention that they're pretty cheap in price."}
{"text":"I''m not going to repeat what so many already know about KoMex.

My favorite thing(s) to eat here are the fusion tacos...5 stars!  I also enjoy their trio of sauces/salsas

Honestly not a fan of their kimchi fried rice...uber greasy!  It gets 2 stars.  The signature bulgogi nachos also weren't as good as I was expecting...3 stars.

Great waitresses & the food comes out in a reasonable time considering how busy it gets.  People call in to go orders when the doors open.  I always manage to get here right as they open, so I haven't dealt with any wait time.  However, the place is always filled up with customers waiting by the time I am done eating.  FYI...they DO take reservations."}
{"text":"I am convinced that this original location is better than the second location. If you've never tried Komex, try this one! The cooking surfaces are more well-seasoned here because it used to be a Chinese restaurant?

Stick with the fusion tacos, and order the Korean wings if you're tempted.

The bulgogi and kimchee here don't necessarily impress as standalone items, but in a taco you should enjoy them?

It used to be really cheap to eat here, now it's not as cheap, but still somewhere between Chipotle and Lindo Michoacan..."}
{"text":"Ordered to go, got the fried rice and beef and pork belly skewers. 

And maybe I ordered the wrong thing but the fried rice was very bland. The skewers we okay.

Just not very flavorful. It was a miss for me."}
{"text":"Long overdue review. 

KIMCHI FRIED RICE IS A MUST!!!! ANYTHING with the kimchi is good.

We ordered a couple of other dishes like the kimchi burrito, nachos, fish tacos, sandwiches. They're just OK. 

The place is small, service is quick with a smile. Since all the food is made to order, prepare to wait a bit."}
{"text":"all of their food is good. i like the flavors and the different types of sauces you can get. being korean the flavors are familiar to me but everything works well. the fresh guac is always good. i always get some tacos and a bulgogi quesadilla with kimchi, cant go wrong with that. i dont know if im really sensitive to MSG but i always get the MSG symptoms really bad. 

thirsty and sleepy

and the amount i eat is usually moderate. so its not the itis. the only time i seem to get that way is when i eat at a chinese place that loads up on the MSG. maybe they add a lot of salt. NO MSG!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. I tried the 2 meat combo platter. Had the  Bulgogi (Beef) &  Daeji gogi (Spicy Pork) with steamed rice. DELISH !!!
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"i normally just do check in quick reviews, but the fact that this place had so many high reviews made me feel as though i must log on and speak the truth.
the problem with yelp is that no two people have the same taste in food. i think my tastes are much more refined than say, the people who go ahead and give mc donald's 2 or even 3 stars. i LOVE food. and i am willing to spend money on a satisfying meal with good service. that being said, i am starting to believe that when a place like this gets such high reviews, it is the quality of the taste of the reviewers that is lacking.
i made reservations for 8pm and arrived at around 745. we were seated rather immediately, then proceeded to wait and be COMPLETELY ignored for about 20 minutes. this was a busy friday evening, and there were TWO servers, obviously not enough for this establishment, since not one could even spare a second to stop by the table and at least give a friendly greeting. other tables were enjoying their free chips, salsa, and guac while we sat with an empty table waiting.  eventually i got up and asked a waitress if we could have some water.  then more time went by while we continued to be ignored.
FINALLY a waitress came over and said, \"what would you like?\"
at which point we ordered, and i said, \"and do we get free chips and salsa?\" she said yes, and after taking our order ran off again. this is a tiny place so i could see everything that was going on, and as the minutes continued to tick by, every time i saw her pull up a plastic basket i hoped it was for our chips and salsa, but alas, it wasn't, time and time again. AGAIN, i finally asked the other waitress if we could get our free chips and salsa, and it was brought.
at this point others were sitting around us, and being treated in the same manner. i felt embarrassed for them and bad, that they were sitting, staring around, waiting for someone to just ask them what they wanted to drink as we had done moments before. 
when the food finally came, i was excited because i had read so many incredibly positive reviews that i really expected a taste sensation. i was so disappointed. main word to describe what i tasted would be BLAND.  the only thing i enjoyed was the fish taco, which was really good, but i think that was mainly because of the sour cream, for which i am a sucker. i also got fusion lettuce wrap and fusion tostada, both with chicken, and both pretty damn boring. i think the deal with this food is that if you don't like spicy and don't get it with spicy sauce then you don't get flavor. this is me, unfortunately.
that being said, my boyfriend got the fusion burrito and absolutely loved it, as well as the pork sliders, which i must also admit were delicious. 
however i was so offended by the service it took the rating down so many notches, and then the food being so bland just solidified a two star rating.  i suppose the only reason it's not at a one star is because the prices were INCREDIBLY cheap, but, again, cheap food isn't worth it to me if what i'm getting amounts to crap.
frankly i would have gotten more bang for my buck at taco bell."}
{"text":"Not busy at all when I came in last weekend for lunch. Unlike the other location there is:
* A place to park.
* No wait.
* Nice, knowledgeable wait staff.
* Fast service.
Expect the same, great food that you want to tell the whole world about. Personally I enjoy:
* Fusion Tostada- Bulgogi, pico de gallo, and lettuce on top a delicious crunchy rice patty. Think the bottom of your rice cooker, but tastier!
* Fusion Nachos- Get the half order and you'll still have more than enough. So much cheese! As with anything else, load up on hot sauce. It's sweet and hot!
* Bulgogi Cheesesteak- It's like a cheesesteak but with bulgogi beef. Also the cheese isn't all oozy and slimy.
* Fusion Flautas- I have to have at least one. Something crazy happens when they mix cheese and bulgogi beef. It will change you!
You will order too much food. Take it home and eat the soggy leftovers. Also, your burps will stink like yummy."}
{"text":"So good! We have been here three times and have had excellent service every time. We love the chips and salsa they give you when you sit down. All the tacos and burritos we have tried so far have been delishious. The kimchi that can be added to the burrito is excellent also."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch here on 01/15/14. Bulgogi fries were good, not sure what I was expecting. Wontons were awesomely delicious. Quick service when calling in an order. Next time I will dine in and I will definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"One word - YUMMY!  I was a little concerned about this place due to the neighborhood.  But, the shop is very clean and the wait staff super friendly and professional.  I can't wait for my children to come home from college so I have another excuse to go there!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy pork and chicken with rice when I came for the first time and it was good. Very tiny hole in the wall but the food was good, I would go back again."}
{"text":"Broke da mouth, OMG, amazingly delicious food. Can't wait to go back and I just had some a few hours ago. Fusion tacos for about $1 and fusion burritos for about $4, cheap and nice size portions, I don't remember the rest of the menu but your going to love this place.  Did the bulgogi fusion burrito, the first bite was so out there it was ridiculously good, never tasted anything like it ever, each bite got even better than the last until it was all gone. The owner, Linda I believe, hooked it up, with some pretty good egg rolls, with salsa and guacamole , tortilla chips, oranges for dessert nicely presented, and bottled water. The egg rolls aren't a regular item and need to be ordered in advance. Everything is made fresh so your food gets to you a little longer but well worth the wait. There's also a good selection of bottled juices and sodas. Love this place."}
{"text":"Komex is a true treasure. Bring all you love here.

Not so great part of town and parking is limited. Gets crowded and the wait is long so come at a weird time like 3-5 p.m.

For your first times you will order only from the fusion menu. Then you can live life without regrets. The fusion fries and fusion nachos with bulgogi beef are more than enough for one, share. 3 tacos are enough for one person. All the tacos are perfect. Choose freely. Try something different each visit, but try nachos, fries and tacos first.

Complementary items here are a generous surprise. Homemade chips with salsa AND guacamole.  Dessert oranges.

No tap water here. That's very considerate. I personally enjoy the iced tea.

This is a family business so come often and tip well. You should be anyway because this is a fine restaurant."}
{"text":"Having previously been a big fan of the KoMex location on Decatur, I met up here with a few friends for dinner.

For starters, this location is a lot larger and more comfortable. The servers are attentive and nice. I ordered the beef enchiladas.

To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. The enchilada came out a bit cold, the Korean-style beef wasn't evenly distributed within the enchilada, and parts of the rice tasted a little dry and overlooked. It might have been the dish, or the fact that we were a large group, but I wasn't a huge fan and wouldn't eat that dish again.

As a note for large groups: I appreciated that they split the bill for our table without issue, left us with a pitcher of water, and gave us (like at the old location) delicious orange slices, with plenty extra for the whole group, to munch on afterwards."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat! Food is amazing, service is wonderful, the nachos, tortas, and pork belly tacos were all amazing."}
{"text":"My wife heard about this place on Yelp and really wanted to try it. So we ventured over last weekend. I am glad we did!

This is one of the best Korean/Mexican fusion places I have been to. WAAAY better than Hanshik taco and maybe even better than the famous Kogi trucks in L.A.

We got the chicken, beef, and pork fusion tacos. We got the chicken in a lettuce wrap and the other two in a corn tortilla. We also ordered the bulgogi burrito. Everything was great. I preferred the tacos, but that has a lot to do with the fact that I'm not a big fan of rice in my burritos.

I plan to be a regular customer."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good.  And love the prices, it's a small place but they're remodeling!  Offers American and Mexican sodas ::thumbs up::"}
{"text":"this fusion spot is so delicious.  if you like korean and mexican, you can't go wrong.  the bulgolgi burrito was so yummy and also very big.  my husband and i shared.  definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"If there was a fashion statement for food, it would definitely be fusion food! A lot of restaurants are trying different combinations and mixes and I think the best would be Korean and Mexican fusion food. When I found out about KoMex, I knew I had to give it a try. After reading the Yelp reviews and looking through pictures, I was impressed and my stomach was speaking to me... like it needed some KoMex! I'm just kidding, but really though, I was impressed now the only thing was to try it! 

There are two locations in Las Vegas now. When I first found out about this place, the only location was the one on Decatur/Washington. (I have yet to try the new one located on Buffalo/Flamingo). The location is somewhere more north of Las Vegas so a lot of the buildings are older and smaller. The plaza where it is located is in a plaza where there is a limited parking spot. Every time I go, I find a parking spot so i'm sure its not that bad! The moment you walk in, the restaurant is small, but it smells so good! Service is great! You are greeted immediately and sat down to a table.

Every table gets a complimentary chips and salsa with guacamole. The guacamole is so good and taste very fresh! Everything on the menu is what you would expect at a Mexican restaurant except it says \"Fusion\" before it. I thought it was funny! Anyway, some of the food that I have tried:

Fusion tacos- I usually get the pork belly tacos and the bulgogi tacos with flour tortillas. Oh man, oh man... what can I say about the pork belly tacos... IT'S AMAZING! The pork is so fatty and cooked perfectly! Its not tough and its so juicy! They put the pico on top with shredded lettuce and the sauces that the server gives you once your food is ready! Bulgogi tacos are also a favorite of mine! The beef is cooked perfectly with a hint of sweetness to it! All the tacos are delicious and you have a choice of flour tortillas or have them with a lettuce wrap!

Pork-belly fries- Okay, by now I think you should get the hint that I love pork belly. One of my guilty pleasures! Think of carne asada fries, but with pork belly and the special sauces that they add and jalapenos! It is that good! Must try for yourself!

Pork-belly musubi- It was a special at that time, but i'm sure you can order it. Just like spam musubi, they replace it with pork-belly. It was a bit too oily for me so I wouldn't really order it as much. Only when I crave for it!

Fusion chimicanga- I had this with bulgogi and man.. its HUGE! I couldn't eat too much of it, but it was good nonetheless!

My favorite here would definitely be the tacos. Man, i'm getting hungry just writing this review."}
{"text":"Love this place!
Great food!
Great service!

They give you chips and dip while you are waiting for you food. It's a very small place. Prices are very reasonable. Staff is very friendly. It's literally great because it is something I have never tried in Vegas. It is one of a kind!"}
{"text":"Decent price
Quick service
Busy place, so it's difficult to find a table
food was interesting, I love Mexican and Korean, but together it's just not my cup of tea.  The food just seemed greasy albeit seasoned well
and NO scissors for the kimchi"}
{"text":"Komex continues to show how exceptional it is on so many levels, and with the recent remodel of the interior seating (sorely needed - my bum was getting sore from the saggy booths) things just keep on looking up here.  Various forms of Kogi, Jim's Fried Rice (Jim - whoever you are, either you have invented a great dish or you taste oh too good) and all forms of Korean/Mexican fusion makes fare that I have not seen replicated in the valley."}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic food. Great portions. Nacho's were great. Waiter was very attentive and informative. Will return soon."}
{"text":"Love love Korean Mexican fusion!  Bulgogi fries, kimchi fried rice, pork belly tacos and nachos were so delicious!  A must try and once you try it, you'll be hooked!  Amazing flavors, mixture of korean meat and mexican dish combined!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, i cant tell you how excited I was to find out that there are at least a few Korean fusion places here in Vegas. There are literally none in WA where I just moved from and they are totally missing out. 

I've been to a ton of Korean fusion places in CA where Korean pizza is my favorite thing of all time. I have yet to find that here, but Korean + Mexican sounded amazing too so I made sure to come here as soon as I moved here. 

I ordered the Bulgogi flautas which were heaven. The meat was full of flavor, not fatty, and juicy. The outside of the flautas was light, but crispy which made for an overall amazing texture. There are some foods that I just can't stand just do to texture so I'm glad these passed both the flavor and texture test. I love that they sell Mexican coke here too. 

The place was clean, the staff were very friendly, the cost was decent, and the wait really wasn't bad considering it's all made fresh when you order."}
{"text":"I FINALLY made my way to KoMex after long anticipation and boy, did it live up to its hype! 

I stopped in after finding myself on \"that\" side of town and had luckily arrived ten minutes shy of their opening time. My guy and I sat in the car to wait until the clock struck 11. As we did, I noticed car, after car, after car pull into the parking lot. I kept eying the rearview mirror saying aloud, \"I wonder if they're going to KoMex...\" As I watched the first car full of people make their way towards the KoMex door, I jumped out of the car and dashed for the door (I entered first by the way). 

We took our seats and browsed through the menu. While there were many items on the menu I wanted to try, we agreed that we HAD to try something off the fusion side. We decided on sharing an order of the Bulgogi fries and musubis on the side (the latter selection mainly due to the fact that I have a man from the islands). So, the place filled up within minutes of being there and while we waited, we were served homemade chips that were warm, crisp, not too salty, not too greasy. Just my style. 

The fries arrived first and man, were they delicious! The mixture of flavors of everything atop the mound of goodness was perfect-- It somehow tasted as though you topped off an order of Gordon Biersch's garlic fries with perfectly cooked bulgogi. Let me tell you, it tasted better than an order of Roberto's carne asada fries after a night of intoxication. The musubis arrived shortly after and didn't disappoint. I've actually never seen them molded the way they did-- they were wider and flatter than other places usually make them. 

Two things I did observe during my visit which is the only reasons why I didn't tack on that extra star:
1) As a holder of a food handler's card with lots of knowledge of food handling, I did observe one of the workers wearing the same pair of food handler's gloves the ENTIRE time I was there. The same pair was used to scoop ice, serve drinks, serve food, get items from the back, move the kitchen curtain, etc. I received a plate with a little bit of food on it as well as the drink I ordered having remnants of food that wasn't mine. 
2) I should've chosen my seat differently. I sat in a position directly across from the opened gate that separates the little prep counter with the customer seating. This gave me full view of the large garbage can that I wish I hadn't had view of during my entire meal. Next time, I'll sit elsewhere. 

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Korean food -Yes! Mexican food- Good!  KoMex combines them both --Are you freakin' kidding me? Although this is not in the best of neighborhoods, you need to go now! No really -- GO NOW! 

The bulgogi nachos are fantastic! Piled high with Mozzarella cheese and tasty beef, these nachos are big enough for two to share. The nachos come with a hot sauce that is absolutely amazing. At first, it looked like it might be too spicy, but then out of nowhere it hits you upside the head with a sweet kick. I also tried Jim's bulgogi fried rice- WOW! Could be the best thing I ever ate -- at least top 3. Strangely addicting, this fried rice doesn't come with the previously mentioned hot sauce-but go ahead and add some. 

For a party of 5, we spent about 40 dollars and had leftovers to take home. I seriously wonder how they could charge so little for food this good. I have told at least 10 people about this restaurant in the last week-I can't stop!"}
{"text":"We had the bugogi bowl and the kimchi fried rice. Price is reasonable and so is the portions. food tasted good. service was also great! we will be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I LOVE their food! I've had quite a few things on the menu, and I've never been disappointed. My favorite dishes is the bulgogi tacos and bulgogi nachos. But explore, because they make good food!!

This is a mom & pop type of place so don't expect the fine dining experience. But honestly, some of the best foods I've had have been at these type of places."}
{"text":"I read about this place in a lot of foodie reviews.  I don't always agree with these foodies, but KoMex Fusion Express was OUTSTANDING!!!  They have homemade tortilla chips that looked so good/unique that I had to try them.  AWESOME!!!!  Then I had the bulgogi beef fried rice.  The dish was named best new food for 2011 by some food critic.  The critic was right...DOUBLE AWESOME!!!!  I can't wait to go back.  Super service and SUPER FOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"First, I didn't realize that the location was so far from our house. It was listed as a \"deal nearby\" even though it was over 25 minutes away. I am a huge fan of Kogi in California. I had the pleasure of eating Kogi at Coachella last year.

So, I was thrilled that a Korean-Mexican fusion restaurant was here in Vegas. So, after driving forever, we arrived. The first thing I was greeted with was \"we are closed and we didn't lock the doors. But if you order now, you can take it to go.\" Thanks to everyone's reviews I knew what to order.

The bulgogi quesadilla was very greasy. The fried kimchee had a layer of grease floating on it. The meat didn't have the marinated flavor everyone talked about. The bulgogi burrito had a lot of rice and beans, lots of filler. The highlight was the spam musubi. The spam was fried and crispy. 

So my experience could be just bad because we got there at closing. I would have rather left than paid for ok food and received the impression I was inconveniencing the owners."}
{"text":"So I've been going on a bulgogi binge of late. This place is on the way home from work and I decided I had t see what all the yelping was about. It's in a small complex that has a couple of empty/broken into/deserted stores that really make you believe you took a wrong turn and may be entering the slums of Bombay. Either way, don't drive by too fast, otherwise you'll miss this camouflaged beauty..

The first time I came in, they said there would be a 30 minute wait for a to go order. I decided against the wait and made a plan of coming back the next day, but making sure to order ahead. I would recommend doing the same because I think 20-30 minutes is the norm for a to go order at any time of the day.

I ordered a Bulgogi and Kimchee burrito. Usually the only burritos I ever get are from Chipotle, but how can you pass up Korean Mexican? We don't have any of these places in Arizona so the novelty was not lost on me. The burrito was overfilled with bulgogi (the way i like it) and was super spicy (also the way i like it). Bottom line: It was super bueno. Make sure you have an ice cold drink to tolerate this burrito. And this place is light on your wallet, $5.50 or so was the total...but make sure you bring cash if your total is under $10."}
{"text":"Oh Lord this is An amaaaaazzzzzing!!!!! Place. Food is in fire! Gotta takenypur peeps there, its clean, cozy, and prices are amazing. Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I think my taste buds have aged considerably during the last five years. I consider it a good maturing. Five years ago I would seek out a little Mexican food every couple of months, and I really enjoyed visiting KoMex...these days?...I can't remember the last time I sought out something other than an al pastor taco. I stopped into KoMex recently though, and felt compelled to write an update. 

KoMoex is the right place for you if you enjoy burritos, chimichangas, tostadas, enchiladas, etc. because the Korean fusion sends it over the top...over the top in the good, 1987, Lincoln Hawk kind of way. It really is a great marriage for the standard Mexican food fare we have here in the states.

You come here because you are looking for value that brings some killer taste with it. My issue has less to do with KoMex specifically, and more to the point that there are a lot of other types of food I would rather enjoy...even at these reasonable prices. Additionally, if you're a fan of Korean food, KoMex may not do much for you. I still hold to my previous advice: KoMex is best experience with someone else, so that you can share a larger item from the fusion side of the menu, like a burrito, chimichanga, tostada, or enchiladas (whatever you normally would get at a Mexican place) and then have two or three tacos for yourself!"}
{"text":"Yum! I love their bulgogi tacos! The extra stuff they put on top is excellent and the meat (while a little greasy) tastes great. The staff is always really friendly. This 5-star  rating is based 100% on their food, because the booths are really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"So yummy. I love the fusion nachos with kimchi"}
{"text":"If Guy Fieri hasn't already reviewed this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives, somebody needs to let him know ASAP...

I've heard about this place for a while and I finally got a chance to check it out.  And let me tell you, this place did not disappoint.  I can be an honest critic of Korean food, because I've been eating it since birth.  Let me first start off by saying this place is a true \"mom & pop\"/ \"hole-in-the-wall\" type restaurant.  I was expecting this from other reviews and what I was personally told about this place.  

The place is small, very busy and crowded for lunch, and a longer wait than expected.  But the food and the prices were amazing!!!  I had the Fusion Burrito with Korean pork, Bulgogi tacos, Fish tacos, Fusion chicken tacos, the bulgogi fried rice, and the bulgogi fries.  Everything was delicious.  The chicken was very tender and the pork was excellent, but mildly spicy (I'm used to very spicy Korean pork).  But blend that Korean meat with Mexican flavor, and you have yourself savory piece of heaven in your mouth with every bite.

The portions are great for what you pay for.  The Fusion burrito is $5, and it's bigger than the carne asada burrito you get at Robertos. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who lives or is visiting Vegas.  When you do go, bring some patience with you and take it for what it is.  It's a busy \"mom & pop\" shop, with the mom running around as the only hostess, server, runner, buser, and cashier.  But the food and prices more than make up for it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Had a pork belly taco and a bulgogi taco, that woulda been filling enough. Then split the bulgogi tots those were great too, decent portion size. Definitely full after leaving woulda been fine with just the two tacos. 

Definitely want to come back and try other menu items

Only thing I regret is I forgot to request kimchi (only a fault of my own )  

Will most definitely be coming back.,"}
{"text":"I had the 2 item plate and it was so good. Their bolgi beef was delicious. Very tender and the rice was good too. Great service will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"We came here per a recommendation from our friends who are locals. Great concept but we have had better in San Diego. 

Bulgogi Tacos - The meat is very well marinated but other than that, the taco was stuffed with more veggies than meat. 

Bulgogi Chicken Tacos - This was just okay. There were pieces that were chewy and pretty sure I had a bone. 

Bulgogi Burrito - Same as the taco but filled with rice. This was huge! But nothing spectacular. The rice was mushy. 

One thing I noticed about this place was their tortillas didn't have that tortilla texture. It is more mealy. Not a fan of that. 

Best thing about this restaurant would be the two slices of watermelon at the end and the fortune cookies."}
{"text":"Komex was amazing. I went with my family and bf and we all ordered different things. We got the Kim chee fried rice, Mongolian beef, bulgogi fries and fusion burrito. All of which were amazing, the best Mongolian beef ever. The bulgogi fries was so amazing that we came back the next day only to find out that they are closed on mondays. Try this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"1st time trying komex food..  And I have to say..  It's good! I love both xD and so happy this is rite by my place now. I will be there all the time know I hope this place stays..  Cuz in that spot has been like 2 restaurants that came and gone.."}
{"text":"From the second we walked in the door to the time the check was paid, the customer service was excellent. We were immediately greeted with a cheerful hello and the waitress, Liz, promptly arrived to deliver the menus and take the drink order. She came back with drinks and a basket of complimentary house made chips with salsa and guac. 

I said that we were first timers so she helped us make some selections and recommended we give the fusion tacos a go, and we did. We sampled shrimp fusion tacos, fusion flautas with dak-bulgogi (chicken), stir fried kimchi, fried wontons and veggie chow fettuccine. Everything we tried was ok but I was a little disappointed with the spicy level. I was expecting HOT and I got mild at best. But it's nothing a little hot sauce won't cure. Also, I'd probably order the kimchi fried rice (Liz said it was really good) instead of the stir fry in the future. 

For the price, the portions are large. It's a decent spot to grab some quick, cheap lunch and I can't imagine I won't give it another go. I want to give some of the other items a try. I've got my eye on those nachos everybody is raving about."}
{"text":"I wasn't really sure how I would feel about a mexican/korean fusion joint but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. This place really exceled at the fusion tacos, especially the bulgogi (beef) tacos which really went well together. Also I was really impressed by the fried rice as well. The only down side was the spicy pork was a bit of a dissapointment, not that it was bad, but I have had better elsewhere. Staff was nice and friendly and the price was very reasonably as well."}
{"text":"We ordered the beef fried rice and four fusion tacos (chicken and pork). The pork had more flavor but both were good, we had no complaints. You have a choice of different sauces you can add on your item which really kicks up the flavor a notch! Best part; complimentary chips and salsa/guacamole! Plus our bill was less than 15$"}
{"text":"The other location was closed this weekend so we came here instead..
Very spacious restaurant with tables, chairs, and bamboo sticks.

shared bulgogi nachos, which was good..loaded with melty cheese.
fish taco came in flour tortilla with lettuce.  no white sauce on top but plenty of salsa on the table to add to.  loved the kimchi salsa they had.  very spicy but very tasty and addictive.
bulgogi cheesesteak was loaded with meat, cheese, and onions.

besides fusion stuff, they have the traditional mexican foods.  everything was lacking in flavor, but thanks to the salsa, it livened it up a bit..."}
{"text":"So goood.. Sweet sweet cholesterol. Nursing a hangover from the weekend, my friends and I decided to venture away from the pricey strip options and search for some highly rated, 1 dollar sign places on yelp. Lucky for us, KoMex satisfied our only 2 requirements. 

We shared a plate of bulgogi nachos and I had the chimichanga. Everything was fried, oily, and absolutely delicious. Excellent food for getting rid of that death feeling after ingesting too much alcohol at 3am. However, I wouldn't exactly recommend eating here with 6 of your friends and then cramming onto a plane back to the Bay Area. Sorry again for all the farts, UA1463."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! We spent 4 days in Las Vegas visited some top restaurants ....expensive... And by far Komex had the best food n best service... Had the fusion flautas best I've had will definitely go back every time I visit Vegas"}
{"text":"San Pedro was blessed to have this deliciously amazing eatery from Las Vegas in a 2 day pop up event at Ports'o'call. We are hooked on the chicken bulgogi tacos with lettuce, shredded veggies, and a killer hot sauce. Our senses were left in a state of arousal only teen boys at the girls camp would know. All perfect. All delectable. All wonderful."}
{"text":"Went because we were at a basketball tournament nearby. Had good Yelp reviews so gave it a try.

Everyone really liked it. I had a pork belly taco and it pretty much ruled. Beef noodles were awesome too!  Wanna come back and try the burrito."}
{"text":"My friend has been trying to get me to try this place for a long time. I wish I would have come here long time ago. Great food at cheap prices. Must try pork belly tacos and bulgogi nachos!"}
{"text":"Always amazing food here. I lived in Korea for a year and a half and love good Korean food. I love good Korean fusion food too and Komex does it better than almost anybody. All food is very well priced and ginormously flavorful. Burritos are huge, tacos are fantastic and the nachos and fries are humongous portions. You can get Korean style beef, chicken or pork. Authentic flavors in all. There's also a great variety of hot sauces to put on everything. I strongly recommend getting kimchi added to your order for a little more kick."}
{"text":"Very good stuff! Been here twice in the last week. So far I've had the carne asada tacos and now the combination fried rice. An absolute must try if your in the area."}
{"text":"The BOMB!!! One of the best fusion spots I've had the pleasure of dining. The tacos, pasta, burritos...it's all good!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars without hesitation!!  Me and My T try to make it out here at least once a week, it's amazing.  

Must haves:
Bulgogi tacos
Fried rice with Bulgogi
Wonton soup (My favorite)

The tacos are incredible.  The beef is so tender.  The portions are great.  The price is great.  I would honestly pay much more for the food, there are few places that I would make this statement.

The fried rice is addictive, that's the only way I can describe it.  I seriously can't stop eating it.

The soup is a must have.  Again, portion is big, a lot of people can share it.  Such a comfort food, wontons bursting with flavor.  You can even order 4 fried wontons for 1 dollar!  They are just as good.  

By the way, a little disclaimer:  On the wall there is a newspaper clipping.  There are two handsome men featured in one of the articles!!"}
{"text":"This joint is not amazing by any means. The service is OK, but the food is whack! No flavor. I've had Korean food and Mexican food that tastes great. Not this. I had a calamari taco and a fish & shrimp burrito. My wife had noodles & wings. Nothing stood out. There was a ton of food left over. Did I mention that it's overpriced? \"Overpriced\" as in: if the food does not taste good, I paid too much."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall, stopped here because my work opened a new location nearby and nobody knew where to go for lunch. I trust the yelp nation and the reviews looked positive.
I ordered a two item plate which was really more cod than I needed but I am a big guy so that's not a complaint. I had a Korean bbq meat - can't really remember how to spell it but bogoli(?) which was awesome along with veggies and white rice. The flavor of the meat was excellent and the veggies were cooked perfectly, not too crisp but not too soggy.
Service was a little slow but food is made to order so again a good thing. Parking is limited at lunch time when I came in all the more reason to get in a little early.
I am not sure when I will be back in Vegas again but will try something different here next time."}
{"text":"Straight out of the car from Salt Lake City. We didn't stop at the hotel. We didn't drive the strip. We set the GPS coordinates for Komex and as road-weary travelers, peeled ourselves out of the car and ambled in to the restaurant.

We don't get much (read:any) Korean-Mexican fusion in Salt Lake, so I was really looking forward to seeing what exactly it was. The food around us smelled terrific, and after eating right for days on end, it was time to splurge. Spend those calories!

So what does a fella order when he wants to taste around? The bulgogi burrito, of course. Oh, and then a couple of tacos as an add-on to taste the other meats. One dak-gogi and one daeji-gogi, just to be safe. 

It wasn't pretty the way I unhinged my jaw and swallowed that whole burrito. But it wa oh-so-delicious. The side of kimchi made all the difference in the world, too. Beautiful, baby! And the tacos were tasty as well. I favored the pork over the chicken, but really--it was all unique and bursting with new flavors.

I also got to sample the vegetarian noodles which had a slightly smoky flavor and were served in an approximate 47lb. mound. Portions are generous here, and there's plenty o' bang for not hardly a buck."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday morning - we literally sat outside waiting for 11 am to hit so we could run inside. We intentionally came to this location so we can see how the new Komex is doing before heading out of town. 

What I'm happy to see is how much bigger the seating area of this Komex is. I always felt a little claustrophobic in the main one. There are still complimentary chips w/ salsa & guac, and the cute orange at the end of your meal. These are both awesome, and I hope they stay forever. 

The real testament was the Chicken Bulgogi Enchiladas ($7.50) - they were as fantastic, if not even better (!) than I've always remembered. :-) Big pieces of perfectly grilled dark meat, a ton of gooey cheese, and the mild sauce that lets me jazz it up with the 4 sauces they put on each table. The service is still friendly and awesome. 

Really wish we had Komex out in CA, I'd probably eat there everyday. Keep expanding, please! :-)"}
{"text":"We've been going to this place for a couple years now, and things are changing, though not necessarily for the better/worse. The menu is now pared down to Fusion, Korean, or Mexican, where it used to be more expansive. Your fusion favorites are still on the menu, and that's the real reason to go to this restaurant, anyway!

Free chips & salsa/guacamole still exists, and I love it. The guac is simple and delicious, and is a perfect appetizer. 

This time I had the Fusion Enchilada Plate w/ Chicken Bulgogi ($7.50 - great pricing). Meat wrapped in fried corn tortillas topped w/ red sauce, cheese, rice, and fresh produce. Tasty and filling, but not the best item on their menu. For that I would go with...

The Fusion Burrito w/ Beef Bulgogi ($6.75). I feel like the entire restaurant revolves around the aura of this burrito. It is spicy, it is fresh, it has green and caramelized onions, pico de gallo, and cilantro in it. It is incredible. I highly recommend making use of the hot sauces they have (sweet chili and green tomatillo are my favorites). If you're looking for the true Korean-Mexican fusion experience, go with this menu item. 

Sober, hungover, and anywhere in between, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"WHO: To all of you Korean food wrapped in tortilla goodness lovers!

WHEN: I'm not too sure when they open, but I do know they close at 9pm.

WHERE: North Decatur, sooooo far but soooo good! =/

WHAT: It all began one night at about 8pm. My friend and I were thinking of a new food place to try. This one suddenly popped in my head (not knowing where it was even located), I called to see if they were still open, turned on GPS, and then realized how far we were supposed to travel (we were coming from the Southwest side of town)... We ended up getting there around 840pm.. I pretty much felt bad bec I saw they were closing and 9pm... Yes, I was that customer... lol

When we entered, there was a Korean lady who greeted us (I think she was one of the owners). I appologized about coming in and ordering super late. She said it was just fine, with a smile! =) We then looked through the menu, and I wanted everything!! She helped us choose and we ended up getting...

-The Fusion burrito: which consisted of spicy pork & kimchi wrapped in a burrito. Sooooo good
-Pork belly musubi: which was the special going on at the moment. Sooooo good!!

We were then greeted happily & we went on our merry ways... I love that place! I need to go back ASAP. Like NOW!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I travel I love checking out cheap and good places where real locals love to eat. Having asked a few of my friends for suggestions the #1 recommendations was Komex.  

Parking: I'm guessing during the day time this parking lot gets packed but luckily Komex has its own strip mall parking Thumbs up

Atmosphere:
Being from Hawaii the place is alright. Kinda old school looking. Otherwise its not much to look at. Basically what I would expect out of a Hawaii Plate lunch restaurant

Service:
All I can say is the service was fast, food came quick and everything worked out great

Cost:
In Vegas standards this place can be really cheap or somewhat on the pricer side. Either way I think for a complete meal your looking to spend at least $6 per person.  I had a half order Kalbi nachos and 1 taco and I was pretty good and that was about $7

Food:
Seeing all the Yelp reviews I had to try the bulgogi Nachos and a pork taco.  Both items were definetly worth the money.  The Pork taco had a tad bit of spicy but was tasty and not to faty.  The BUlgogi half or nachos was pretty good and loaded with meat, cheese, salsa and other toppings.  The Bulgogi had a nice flavor and you know it had to be marinated for hours.  I do have a feeling that the nachos were zapped in the microwave oven though.

Overall:
If your looking for cheap and easy then this is the place. I waiting for my next trip to Vegas so I can try the highly recommended fried rice."}
{"text":"The food choices are good here. Service is always friendly. The servers know and always welcome return guests. Affordable and portions are according to prices. Will be back as usual."}
{"text":"We went there to try out based on yelp reviews...sorry to say  it just OK for me. My son loves their enchiladas... me and my husband had chow fun and stir fry beef  which is kinda no taste.  Don't get me wrong they give you pretty large portions with super cheap price you can't go wrong with it. But if you ever had tasty food elsewhere this is not going to be please your taste buds.
Really good customer service, super cheap on my $$ deserve 3 stars for me.
And BTW parking plaza was empty when we went there."}
{"text":"Where is the 10 star rating????

I have been to komex but none of my friends have, because we do not live around there. BUT it IS so worth the drive!!! I took my friend after a day of shopping. I think she was a little freaked out by the sketchy hood. I ordered a bunch of different things to share. Wonton soup, flautas, musubi, tacos, fish tacos and a torta to go for hubby. All that plus tax and tip was $40.  Sooooo much food!!!! It was ALL fantastic.

Besides the TERRIFIC food, I like that you can get a variety of different things. I had never had musubi, cuz I hate spam, but it was good. But then I am able to get the Mexi food that hubby so loves. It is PERFECT! I wish I lived closer, LOL."}
{"text":"Tried this place while on a business trip to Vegas. Very delicious. Mixture of Korean food and Mexican. Tried the fusion burrito with bulgogi beef."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is the best!  Stopped here with the family on the way back from CA to Denver. I can't even begin to describe how great the flavor is on the pork belly and bulgogi tacos. My wife got the bulgogi nachos and they were also out of this world. While they have straight Korean and Mexican dishes I highly recommend getting the fusion items with bulgogi or pork belly. The kimchi fried rice with an egg on top also cannot be missed. It's spicy but not so much that you don't enjoy the dish. A perfect balance. The service was also superb. I didn't get her name but the woman taking everyone's order was upbeat and really friendly and accommodating.  I also recommend, of the 4 sauces they bring you, to try/use the one with sesame seeds in it. 

Not sure why this place gets anything but 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"I only rate the best and this place is way ahead of the rest. Excellent food have to try their signature Komex burrito . Always make my mouth water"}
{"text":"This place is great! The service was amazing. It was our first time in and the server offered to let us sample their different meats which was a log gesture. The value is amazing here, the meals are high quality and the price is cheap! Be sure to add fries to your meal for only $1, these fries are better than McDonald's! Great place guys."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to try this place and spent $105 on takeout for a family of 6. We love to eat.

Kimchi fried rice w/ spam- my husband was ecstatic about this. He loves kimchi and so does my 18 year old. Neither were disappointed. My husband doesn't ask for much, but I already know this made his list of favorites. It wasn't spicy for those that don't enjoy spicy food. 

Calamari tacos- I wanted to order something different for us to try today and this was it. I was worried that the calamari would be too chewy and it wasn't. It was not a hit with the kids though so I won't be ordering this again. 

Bulgogi cheesesteak w/ fries- my 13 year old ordered this and he completely devoured it. His only complaint was the bread was soggy. 

Bulgogi tater tots- soooo good! Tater tots stayed crispy and the meat as well. Cuts were thinly perfect. This has made my list of favorites. A hit with the whole family. 

Spam musubi- huge and delicious. Another favorite and will always be included in my future orders. Ono!

Green Tea Macaroon Ice Cream- This is expensive! Wow... It smelled good and tasted even better. What a treat...

I am so full from all the food that we ordered that I haven't tried the others. I will update this tonight when I get hungry again which will probably be in a couple of hours... lol"}
{"text":"First time visiting, found through a yelp-suggested-search. Thought I would start off with something simple so I ordered the Korean style hot wings with fries. The wings were especially fantastic. Customer service was great too! I will return in the future to try other items."}
{"text":"Love it! Pork belly tacos are the best and the sweet Korean sauce is addicting. I love how they already know what I want whenever I call in for take out."}
{"text":"Bolgogi everything!  Super affordable and generous,  delicious fusion combinations.   The Bolgogi pastrami was delish, as were the couple tacos.  Sadly there wasn't enough room for the cronut Sunday,  but it looked crazy."}
{"text":"I was surprised with the food, in a good way of coarse. I would highly recommend the Torta. It satisfied my cravings. Great costumer service as well!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! I am SO happy that they have opened their Southwest location. It is literally right behind my son's charter school, so you may find me here any given day after school... I used to make the 30 minute trek all the way to their Decatur location, but it was just too far to do every week, so when I heard that they have opened much closer to my home, we had to stop in of course.

On our second visit to this location, Linda was as sweet as ever, remembering my family from months ago! The new location has plenty of seating, so there is no wait for a table anymore. However, when we ate here, there were only about 2 other occupied tables but TONS of people came in and out ordering take-out like I used to. However, the people that are doing take-out are missing out on the chips, guac, and salsa as well as the orange slices and fortune cookies! 

So, this is my second time ordering the tacos as lettuce wraps and I LOVE them! I watch my carbs when I am provided with alternatives and I love that I can get all the flavors that I love in a lettuce wrap. I ordered one of each protein: beef, pork, and chicken. In the 15+ times I've ordered from KoMex, I never tried the pork. I have been missing out. The flavors from the marinade really stand out and are so great. The bugulgi is wonderful as usual with its hints of sweetness. The chicken was good, but did not have the korean flavors as much as the other 2. I'd say if you're weary of Korean flavors, start with the chicken, but please please please try the beef and pork. They are amazing and you will not be let down. Always get kimchee on them, or on the side. I have also tried the tofu taco which is yummy and they said that the tofu taco is not naturally vegan, but they're able to make it vegan, so I can bring my vegan friends here!

My husband ordered the mixed fried rice that comes with every protein including shrimp, as well as the bugulgi burrito. My kids shared what we ate as well as spam masubi. We were stuffed and even had left-overs for about $30 before tip. My favorites are: lettuce wraps/tacos, burritos, chow fettuccine with beef and kim chee fried rice with spam. Make sure to try their korean hot sauce. It is the best! I love that I could technically eat here 5 days straight, yet be eating a different culture of food every day. Their menu is expansive, yet everything is done wonderfully. Thanks for being so welcoming Komex. We will see you soon!"}
{"text":"Komex is amazing. Very original flavors. I always get the pork fuzion burrito and my wife loves the chicken. Used to go to the one on Decatur and was so happy I found they have new one here next to where I moved. They won't give me the hot sauce recipe but don't blame them its freakin awesome.!!"}
{"text":"I was given a heads up by a couple of friends that this place was really good, and it's walking distance away from my house.  Finally something good in my ghetto?  We shall see!

I ordered the bulgolgi burrito to-go.  I was impressed!  The finely chopped veggies were fresh and delightful, and the bulgolgi was well prepared, although maybe a little saucier than I like.  While not the best Korean food I have had in Vegas, it is better than most.  I enjoyed their Mexican take on the dish: wrapped in a flour tortilla burrito in style.  The best thing about this place is the price, about half the cost of my favorite Korean spot!  For your hard earned bucks, you get an amazing quality of food here.  Be careful coming here on the weekend for lunch, the place will be jammed packed!  

Thanks to my Yelp friends for giving me a heads up on this one.  I will definitely make this a usual spot especially for a super fast and cheap meal by my house!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place, meaning I paid almost $60 in cab fare to come out and try this place (we stayed at the Bellagio), but I was so disappointed!!

The meat was not tender at all, especially the pork. The chicken is tasteless. The misubi was way too salty. The portions was not huge as many yelp reviews said it was. The only thing I liked from the mountain of food is the beef kimchi fried rice. But it wasn't spectacular. Any decent korean place will taste just as good. 

Here is what we ordered:
Beef kimichi fried rice: very good

Combo two meat plate: horrible. Chicken was tasteless. The pork was like ground pork, mushy, which was really weird. 

Pork belly misubi: way too salty. I took one bite and threw it away. 

Chicken wings: okay. Drenched in sauce. 

Shrimp and chicken tacos: okay. Nothing too special about it that you can't get from a taco truck."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for work lunch from here one day and I'll probably won't be going back. I ordered Mexican food which wasn't the greatest. Very limited options for vegetarians. I might be willing to try the Korean food next time if we order from here again. As for the Mexican food definitely go somewhere else. Rice and beans were dry tasted like they were straight from the premade can. I don't recommend.."}
{"text":"Linda, you need to fire Kenny what a horrible attitude. First I came in and noticed the sign mentioning you are not fast food. Which I have understood for years, Kenny commented how people still complain and they need to learn to call in their order and stop complaining. Then I brought my order home, calling it in about an hour before picking it up.  I had ordered the bulgogi rolls, usually 6 per order, kenny had never heard of them and had to ask the kitchen about them.  When I checked the order at home there were only 4 rolls and I had made a double order.  When I called Kenny got an attitude with me stating they don't really make them anymore and they won't again because you have franchised out.  He messed up another part of the order and really didn't care.  After eating here since you opened I hope your service doesn't go down hill just because you are opening another place....be careful."}
{"text":"When you can't decide between Korean food or Mexican food, Komex is the perfect choice! 

The complimentary chips and guacamole were delicious. However, I didn't really care for the salsa, it had a weird artificial, vinegar preserved taste. 

This is what we ordered: 
(make sure to add hot sauce and salsa on your tacos and kimchi fried rice, before you eat them! They all needed that extra pop of flavor and salt. The salsa tray is available, you can either grab it yourself or ask for it.)

Bulgogi tacos - the beef had great flavor! It was tender and the rest of the taco was delicious. 

Pork tacos - the pork marinade was a little weak, but add on some hot sauce and salsa and it's just right. 

Pork belly tacos - these had yummy pork belly bits in the taco. My boyfriend said he only got a bite of just fat, but I had a different bite and it was tasty.

Kimchi bulgogi fried rice - it had nice chunks of kimchi with beef and a fried egg on top. I topped it with some hot sauce and it was addicting! 

Wonton soup - the soup came out piping hot. The broth tasted comforting and the flavor was good. The wontons were homemade and the meatball was yummy as well. I would love eating this when I'm sick. 

I would definitely come back to try their other fusion favorites."}
{"text":"Three words you need to know... PORK BELLY TACO! 

The best taco I ever ate. I stop in for lunch to treat myself when I'm on that side of town. Lucky for me, today's special was the Pork Belly Taco. Order one along with the Buldogi meat taco., which was good, but could have eaten a dozen of the pork belly. 
Sweet tender meat with slaw wrapped in a corn tortilla! 
This was a special, hopefully it will stay a special, or make it on the menu!

Again I ordered the won-tons, which you can't go wrong.. the meatiest wontons you will ever have.. As usual chips with salsa and guacamole served when you sit down.. all fresh and delicious.."}
{"text":"I love mash-up restaurants.  I live in  LA and come to Vegas often. I've been told about Komex a few times but never got around to it, until tonight.  WOw!!! The Bulgogi Chimichanga, and Fried Rice were super tasty.  I love Korean food, the ingredients they use are so good + sweet and salty is my thing.  I am Colombian, and have always felt Korean cuisine is somewhat similar,  as we both also use pork with many of our dishes.  
I will be back again this weekend to try the Bulgogi fries, which I heard were the BOMB!!! 

The portions are a great size and the pricing to me is extremely reasonable.  They have earned their 5 *****."}
{"text":"My overall review 2.5/5
Service 5/5 (but...had the nerve to charge gratuity 20% when we were the only table in the restaurant ?!)
Food 2/5
Ambiance 0/5 

4.5 stars review from fellow yelpers, but the food just wasn't up to par.. Something's not adding up here..

*note for the cook, not every dish needs black pepper, less is more sometimes! Not sure if you have tried your food lately but most of your dishes are missing something !! This is Korean Mex fusion , here's a clue, add some creamy sauce to your Mexican inspired dishes*

Now .. My Background ..
I'm from California so maybe the fusion here 
just can't beat it. Most of the dishes seemed to be missing just a little something... I was not impressed. We came here from Utah after hiking all day. Our group of 7 was hungry and ready to chow down.

I'll start with the best and go down the list. Here is what we ordered.

Kim chi fried rice 5/5
I'm a sucker for kim chi fried rice, some people like it, some don't. Me, I love a good kim chi fried rice. This dish packs a moist and flavorful punch in every bite. This is a must order!

Bulgogi cheese steak 4/5
Docked one star because you need to put sauce on each bite to taste the fusion. The \"bulgogi\" was not very seasoned. In general it was a good sandwich for you cheesesteak lovers.

Bulgogi chimichanga 3/5
Hey, where's the meat? Totally just a few scraps in my chimichanga  ? This also needed much sauce with each bite... And why was there black pepper poured all over the top? There is never black pepper on chimichangas or bulgogi!! Why did you put it ? It totally threw off the taste!!

Kimchi side dish 2/5
Hmmm, flavor was good, but $3 for kimchi.. And it's served warm and mushy.. Wttthhhhheck?? This should be cold and only served cold..

Spicy pork fusion nachos 2/5
Oh Koja kitchen, you've ruined me for eveyone else. There was no white sauce on these nachos, and this dish too was missing a certain something .. At least there was no black pepper on this one. Also just a few crumbs of meat accompanied this dish.

Wonton 1/5
Don't order it. Wonton skins soft and soggy, meat filling one dimensional, dry and lacking flavor. Again, heavy handed chef with black pepper overload in the soup but forgot to season the meat in the wonton.

Bulgogi plate 1/5
Dry, super plain and bland presentation. Doesn't look Korean/Mexican/Chinese/American ... Don't order this here !!!

Burrito 1/5  I didn't try it but it looked dry and standard.. Very plain..., I asked my friend who ate it and one word. \"Meh\" Nothing special here to try folks!

I dropped my fork and our waitress heard ,( probably due to the empty restaurant and the cling of my fork falling broke the sound of the crickets in the background ) she quickly came over and replaced it right away. Although I rated this 5/5 service, I suppose she earned the 20% gratuity we were never informed of.. 

Overall, I won't be back. I was wondering how my experience food wise can differ so much from other yelpers. Apparently, another yelper pointed out a change of ownership. That would explain it.

The restaurant was empty during dinnertime, new ownership, you should probably be reading these reviews and stepping up your game.. 

Btw most people like meat.. And with the little customers your have trickling in now a days, you should probably give people more meat to make them happier with your sub par food, unoriginal menu and dull flavors

Note for hungry yelpers, my ballers on a budget.  If you are hungry and need a cheap bite off the strip, you don't need to come out here! Check out all the Asian restaurants off spring mountain. It's a 2-5 min drive from the strip and you can find anything you want there."}
{"text":"This is interesting. Any way you can pack bulgogi into a mexican container is good by me.
Cheap, fast and heaping portions along with the fusion aspect makes this a worthwhile. A little one-trick-pony-ish in the long run, but good stuff. Small locale, fast friendly service."}
{"text":"This place is off the charts! I had the Bulgogi Bowl and it was fantastic! Sampled the Pork Belly and Chicken Tacos and that was really good too. From the outside, it doesn't seem like it would be what you'd expect but the food more than makes up for it. A+! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best cushion in town. The owner is super sweet. The food is filling l, delicious, and a great price."}
{"text":"Found this local favorite through Yelp. Super gigantic portions - familiar Korean favorites (bulgogi) as well as Mexican staples (burritos, tacos, chimichangas) with Korean/Asian ingredients. In particular, the burritos are as big as nuclear bombs. Bonus points for free chips, guacamole, and salsa at your table.

While the portions are large and super tasty, I left feeling super thirsty after trying a bulgogi combo plate with beef and spicy pork. Without further experience here with other menu items, I'd have to attribute this to heavy use of salt, oil, and/or MSG.

The space itself is tiny, with tables for about 25 people max, and service is somewhat rushed because of the tremendous volume they get. Still, a very dependable local option when it comes to portion size, price, and value. Great for feeding small families."}
{"text":"Love this hole-in-the-wall just off the strip.  Can't complain about delicious and CHEAP food!!!

Big fan of the Fusion Tacos!!  I tried the Pork Belly and Beef Bulgogi ones.
Kimchi Fried Rice with Spam was very tasty but a tad greasy for me.
Chow Fettuccine was basically Chow Mein w/fettuccine... get it?

The only thing I wish I did get was the Fusion Nachos!!!!  Next time I'm back in Vegas, I will dine on this!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, both for the vegetarian and the meat lover.  Prices are fantastic. 
Will make their dishes with veggies or tofu instead of meats.  Will definately be back."}
{"text":"This place is a not a place for large groups and I hate that because I like going with friends. There are booths and maybe 3 tables. The interior is nothing fancy.

::: PROS
Inexpensive food
Good-tasting fried rice
Decent amount of menu options

::: CONS
Spam in the musubi was sooo thin and tiny
No refills on drinks
Basically one server, so service was poor (missing utensils, dirty tables, etc.)
Friend found a hair in their fried rice! : /

They immediately replaced the fried rice (with the hair in it) by making a brand new one for them. And I get it, I know accidents happen. It still does not call for a pleasant experience though, right? Nonetheless, my friends thought the food was very good and mentioned it in the weeks following.

I would go back here, but only with a few people. Hopefully my experience will be better..."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went and had a late dinner here. We were immediately greeted and were told we could take a seat anywhere we wanted.  The lady came and gave us placemats and the menus.  It took us a while just to order, not because service was slow, but because I couldn't decide what I wanted! There was so many yummy choices! 

My daughter ordered the Spam Musubi which were HUGE. She liked them and couldn't finish the 2nd one. One order comes with 2 musubi. There was an option to get them with egg, but she declined. I would have ordered it with, but that's neither here nor there. 

I ordered the chow fettuccine with beef bulgogi. I forgot to ask if I could get it without onion or bell peppers. I didn't mind it having it. That part was not overwhelming. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the whole dish had a black pepper and sesame oil taste to it. It was so delicious. I only ordered the half order after the server say it was actually more than half the size of a whole order. Needless to say, I still took half of it home. 

I ordered the bulgogi burrito for hubs when we ordered our food and asked her to make it \"to go.\" Our server did not forget. She brought me a box, the check and my husband's burrito. 

This place is really good. The prices are really too good to be true.  I don't want to say cheap because to me that sounds negative for such delicious food. We will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its reputation!

This evening, we tried 3 menu items at the Decatur location:  The Bulgogi enchiladas, seafood tacos, and Bulgogi cheesesteak (mozzarella and provolone; onions and peppers).  We all were pleasantly surprised by the house salsas and sauces, but the Bulgogi meat was easily the best part of our meal!  Everything was perfectly seasoned, piping hot, and delicious.  The fried food was good, but not as exciting as their non-fried items.  Portion sizes are adequate to generous, and pricing reflects this.

As amazing as the food was, the experience was really enhanced by the service we received tonight.  Ken was our server and explained several nuances of the dishes which newcomers will appreciate.  We felt that the staff was truly passionate about what was being served and sought absolute customer satisfaction.

(TIP:  Pay in cash and get 5% off your order total!)

This is definitely not a place to dress up for (very potent aromas will stay with you for a while), but the food and service were excellent!  If you're looking for affordable and exceptional fusion cuisine, KoMex is a must!"}
{"text":"The staff was very quick to greet us and the food came out very fast. Everything was very delicious. Very reasonably priced, large portions!"}
{"text":"Okay, before my boyfriend and I went to KoMex, I was really excited and we really wanted to give this place a 5 star.  After trying this place out myself to see what the hype was all about, after all it's only like the most highly rated place on Yelp.

We ordered 2 beef (bulgogi) tacos, 2 pork belly tacos, 2 chicken tacos, and shared KimChi fried rice with bulgogi.  The beef tacos were good, but honestly carne asada tacos from like Pepe's are much better and the same cost.  Ranking it as bulgogi, is rather unsatisfying as well since it lacked well marinated flavors that I usually taste with bulgogi.  The pork belly tacos were the most delicious tacos that we had, it was slightly spicy but not over bearing, I have absolutely no complaints.  At the same time, they were not delicious enough for me to merit higher ratings.  The chicken tacos were tasteless, DON'T ORDER.  The KimChi fried rice with bulgogi was served with a fried egg on top, the presentation was great!  The rice itself was alright at best, the kimchi part, was not spicy, it just tasted like it lacked something.  Kimchi that I buy generically in the asian grocery store has more kick.  So we did add quite a bit of garlic chili to it to make me taste better.  I'm not really too sure if they subdued the taste down to white people spicy to make it more palatable since I saw on the menu that they were trying to franchise.  My advice is just stay true to the recipes.

The service is excellent, I'm pretty sure it was family run.  They were super nice and attentive, and if I could rate it based on service alone then I would give them a four star review.

The ambiance, is really shatty.  I would not be caught dead in that area after the sunsets.  The interior of the restaurant looks like it needs a face lift, and some deep cleaning.  

Overall, it was alright at best.  I would probably never come back, or go out of my way to eat there though.  So unless you are already in the vicinity don't bother driving out of your way."}
{"text":"Just ok.  But I'm used to the real deal Korean BBQ tacos off the trucks in LA.  I didn't taste any Korean flavor in the Mexican food. Their fusion was that there was both Mexican and Korean on the menu.  I'm used to it being a fusion of flavors.  This is good strip mall spot but it's not going to knock any foodie off their feet like the reviews suggest."}
{"text":"The servers are super nice, very cheap and yummy! Great place to eat if you have a car or want to avoid expensive Vegas food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service & excellent pricing! Family owned & operated, this place is just fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have been twice!!! I am systematically working my way through their menu!!! Just love everything about this restaurant, love the family environment.... keep it going"}
{"text":"A colleague at work recommended KoMex for lunch and off we went.  A deliciously awesome fusion of Mexican and Korean fare, and it's kind of hiding in plain sigh in a storefront.  Everything our party ordered looked and tasted delicious, and there wasn't a complaint from anyone at the table.  Be sure to ask for chips and guacamole.  It's complementary and tasty, but don't eat too many because the portions for the meals are enough to fill you up.  I cleaned my plate but probably couldn't have eaten more without being too full.  Overall a wonderful experience.  I'll definitely return to try just about everything else on the menu over time.  Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"First time I decided to try it & I ended up grabbing take out. The Philly sandwich was pretty good, except it was so soaked in grease that the bread turned into bread pudding. The fries were nothing special. I'd give them another chance for dining in."}
{"text":"I need to try more of their food, but their TOFU stir fry was really good.  if your looking for vegetarian options I really liked it."}
{"text":"Kimchee fried rice was really good!   They should open a new and larger location though. The place was packed and the seating we were given behind the doors was just a bit cramped with everyone else there too.


Bulgogi fries were delicious as well.   A big enough portion for us to bring home.   

I will definitely come back to try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"I have been hearing how great this place is.  I'm here to tell you that it lives up to the hype.  The pork bolgogi was really great - super tender meat with just the right amount of seasoning.  My friend ordered the Korean tacos - one chicken and one pork and a fusion burrito. He gave the thumbs up to all of it.  The service was great - very fast for the place being filled to capacity and a line of people waiting outside to get in.  The portions are big and the prices are low. I think the tacos were about $1.29 each. I can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu.  

Go support this oustanding small business.  You'll be glad that you did!"}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall place is amazing. The bulgogi beef tacos are so good inside your mouth. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"The food is greasy and ill prepared. I'm only giving it three stars because of the bulgogi burrito  So unless you like sloppy, greasy, psuedo korean-mexican food avoid this place."}
{"text":"Amazing. Loved the wontons and the fusion tacos .... yummy yummy.  Small little place, if blink you will miss it when you drive by... affordable and delicious!"}
{"text":"OrderTheFusion!
See what happened there? KoMex is so good that is makes you type in fusion. I mean it when I say you should ignore all items on the menu that aren't fusion love children.
I also mean it when I say add kimchi to everything.
And I extra-double-super-hybrid-sir-mix-a-lot mean it when I say ask for the hot sauce carousel. The chunky Korean spicy salsa alone is worth the visit.
Also, be careful when searching for this tragically named establishment on your phone. It will autocorrect to Kotex."}
{"text":"Only 229 reviews, so I'll add another one!  I found this on Yelp, and it was only 4 miles from my hotel downtown, so I had to try it.  Best tacos I've ever had!  I ordered a chicken flour taco, a beef corn taco, and a chicken lettuce taco, and was served complimentary chips, salsa, and guac, along with bottled costco water, and the check was $5.25!  I ordered different variations of Tacos all 4 times I went, so I can't comment on the rest of the menu, but both friends I brought with me during my later visits loved it as much as I did!

If you are in Vegas, don't skip this place!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The location makes it a little tough to find, but that's what makes this place a hidden gem. The parking can be a little difficult so I would advise to go after lunch madness. 

The owner is extremely nice and the servers are more than willing to give you recommendations. The price isn't bad either. The flautas are what I always get but you can't go wrong with any of the fusion foods. C'mon were talking about Korean food with Mexican goodness, you can't help but feel giddy just hearing it."}
{"text":"I just tried the bulgogi burrito and I believe it is the best burrito I have ever tasted in my entire life!
Yes... that good!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the Korean wings!!! The flavor was that classic sriracha chili  bomb.double com!! The food wasn't nasty its just well..... I couldn't get my mind around teriyaki flavored meat and nacho fixings!!  I love the idea but I'm only in it for the wings!!! lol"}
{"text":"I guest my expectations were real high for this place, I ate and left and wasn't satisfied one bit. The only thing that hit the spot was the cold coke in the glass bottle. We ate everything - there's was about 8 of us at dinner and tried one of everything like we always do. My sister said usually the food is a lot better and the service was average (which she was pretty busy because she was doing it all). We will be back soon and hopefully it will be better next time."}
{"text":"I came here last week and got the most amazing beef bulgogi chimichanga ever. It kind of reminded me if a Philly cheese steak. Additionally, we ordered kimchi fried rice. Our bill was about 20 dollars. While waiting for our food to cook, we were given complimentary chips, salsa, and guacamole. The chips were like fried wontons and I would definitely pay for more.

The only disclaimer I can leave is not about the restaurant itself. I had a lady come up to my parked car right as I was about to drive away. She of course asked for money. And there seems to be influx of beggars in the surrounding streets. Don't worry my friends, I bought her a chicken sandwich before leaving."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Definitely a place to come back to! Friendly staff and amazingly delicious food! Highly recommend the Bulgogi tater tots and the fusion flautas!!"}
{"text":"I totally recommended this place, the food is super Amazing and it taste great! The portions are enough with what they charge you with. If I could give them more starts I would, the guy is super friendly"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week, so wanted to update my review.

Still ordering the lettuce wrap fusion tacos, and an occasional torta or fish taco.

They hired some new help, and as if this place couldn't get any better, the service is better and the food comes out quicker now."}
{"text":"Komex in two words = Bold flavor. First time here and had a great experience. Had the pork burrito and it was awesome. Can't wait to visit again. Only reason why they didn't get 5 stars is because our waitress was slow. I guess she was dealing with a new system or something."}
{"text":"With their super friendly staff, fast service, low prices, and tasty eats, KoMex is a win!
The bulgogi burrito and kimchi fried rice are my absolute favorites. The meat is nicely marinated and chopped into the ideal size so that you get a perfect bite when you start chowing down.    

Getting in and out is a breeze, but there is sometimes a wait because the place is tiny.  It's best to call your order ahead of time as it will usually take 15-20 minutes for them to prepare the food fresh!  Don't despair, the food is worth the wait. 

Credit/debit will be accepted, but for orders less than something like $10 a small fee of $0.50 will be added.  (Credit card company fees really add up!)  

If you can, pay in cash and help support this wonderful small business!"}
{"text":"I am visiting from out of town and always enjoy try new foods especially those from family owned businesses. Don't let the location or menu scare you off. Let me tell you, this place is fabulous!!!! Who would have known that Korean and Mexican food would taste so good together?!? I was there with family and everything we ordered was delicious. (Fusion burrito, kimchi fried rice with bulogi beef and fusion wings). The servings were plentiful and service was excellent.  This will be one of stops on future visits to Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fusion Restaurant. It's good food any day . I go for the lettuce wraps & tacos . If i go with other people i try other things to spilt . Clean place & Manager is on top of everything ."}
{"text":"Yummy!! I got the kimchee fried rice and the bulgogi flautas. Both were very good. I'd def come again. Wish they had a location on the south side of town."}
{"text":"It is such a far drive around 15 min from the LV strip to this place.  the wait is kind of long, but the wait for food is much longer.  I ordered to-go the bulgogi nachos and tacos.  It took around 30 minutes for the food to come out.  It is tasty but I would not drive this far for OKay tasting food."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The chimichanga is my favorite.  Plus the people who work here are so nice.  I have been to both locations and do not have a favorite one yet.  Good food.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A fusion of Korean and Mexican dishes. The place is okay, average-but nice and clean. The servers are very friendly.

The Mexican slaw is good even without the additional dressing. I ordered the 2 meat combination bulgogi plate, bulgogi taco, and the hubs ordered the bulgogi bowl and meat skewers. The price is a bit on the mid range, above take out and below dine it. 

3 star because of its 'generous meat portions' - 
The meat is plenty and tender, however, it is not marinated enough, the flavor is okay but lacks a punch. Try it for variety but if you're looking for a different experience of Korean-Mex fusion, you're not going to find it here."}
{"text":"overrated by yelpers.. but its ok i tried.

pros:  big serving, quick nice staff, there's free salsa and chips
and one free orange for deserts

cons: claims that food is made to order big no no, meat was already over cooked for the bulgogi and beef with broccoli, too many veggies in the fusion tacos it even comes with bell pepper ????


ps:not really cheap unless you order 2 small tacos and water."}
{"text":"Bulgogi all around! Those who have gone to KBBQ with me know of my love for bulgogi. Take that love and throw in a blend of Korean and Mexican style cooking, and you've got yourself a winner! I love this place! Each bite I took was an explosion of deliciousness that had the right amount of spice and a perfect balance between Korean and Mexican flavor.

I think my absolute favorite dish are the kimchee fried rice. I went with my family and we ordered two plates: one with spam and and one with beef bulgogi. They were both equally good and despite having our own entrees, we cleaned up the fried rice because it was just irresistible. It's as good as any of the best kimchee fried rice you'd have at, thrown in with meats that were cooked to a savory excellence. The fried rice was definitely more Korean so you won't find much Mexican fused into this dish.

For my own entrees I split fusion tacos with my cousin. We had beef bulgogi (duh) and pork belly. These were definitely a split balance between Korean and Mexican style. I couldn't decide which one I liked better but I certainly recommend going with the fusion tacos because you have a lot of choices depending on what kind of meats you like.

I felt really bad because we showed up at 7:30 (they close at 8) and I was worried we might encounter some annoyance with showing up so late, but we got none of that. I really appreciate them being very welcoming, not showing any annoyance with us and still delivering quality food. Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"What a harmonious symphony of flavors!! Who knew that Korean and Mexican flavors could blend in such a way that would make my taste buds sing. The bulogi meat is perfectly marinated and has such an awesome flavor- you can go wrong ordering it in the taco, burrito, nachos... just pile it on high!
The bulogi tacos: loaded with the marinated Korean meat, super fresh and delicious. Just squeeze some lime over it and the flavors speak for themselves. Two tacos is a pretty good portion- espcially if you plan on ordering the nachos too. 
Bulogi nachos: everything nachos could be and beyond. The chips were thick enough to withstand the meat and the thick mozzarella cheese, but they were still super crispy and very addictive. The bulogi meat paired perfectly with the hot sauce in a way that you'll be licking your fingers clean. My only complaint is that the mozzarella cheese gets cold too fast- however I think that's a common problem with all nachos
Cheesesteak: my husband order this monster of a sandwich- you almost need a fork and a knife to enjoy it. The bulogi meat has a more subtle flavor in this dish, but it works well for the cheesestake sandwich. The fries were a little bland and not my favorite- but who cares with all the other knock out dishes. 
To quench your thirst- try their passion iced tea. Perfect on a hot Vegas summer day"}
{"text":"Small, out of the way place, but absolutely worth the effort. The taco trio is awesome. Get one with each of the different meats. Incredible. This is a great twist on some familiar foods."}
{"text":"Pretty good Tacos which are big enough to actually need that second tortilla !"}
{"text":"NEWS FLASH! THE HYPE IS REAL! I REPEAT, THE HYPE IS REAL!

%$#@!@#$% 

Sorry, that was me banging my head repeatedly on my laptop keyboard because I am so mad at myself for not going to this place a lot sooner! I couldnt wait to get home to do this review and I hope my keyboard is gonna work long enough for me to finish this!

I ordered the Bulgogi Beef Burrito and my son ordered the Beef Bulgogi/Spicy Pork combo so we can share. OMG I couldnt make up my mind what to eat so me and my son split both meals.

The Burrito has the best of both Korean and Mexican worlds! Now I know why they named themselves that. This tasty choice has Meat with Mexican Rice, Green & Brown Onions, Pico de Gallo, Cilantro, Lettuce, Asian (Soy/Sesame base Sauce).

Service is, let me put it this way, a little slow BUT before you jump to conclusions, you have to understand that they make everything from scratch and if a big party before you put their order in, then that is what is gonna go through first. That's understandable because if you ordered before somebody else, whether big or small, you should get it first right? With that said, I was a little irritated at first, but when my food came out and went straight to my mouth I was mad at myself for being irritated because the food is well worth the wait! I recommend that you don't be in a rush to go anywhere else if you plan on eating here and if you can order to go, that's even better because by the time you get there, it should be done.

With the popularity of this place blowing up, I see one of two things that might happen: Either they open up another place or move to a much BIGGER location or both. The demand is definitely gonna out do the supply sooner or later because on really busy nights you are definitely gonna have to wait a while to get a table.

Some random info: They are closed Mondays so make sure your cravings don't fall on that day! They have free wifi but I couldnt get my phone to work with it so maybe next time I will ask them. Parking can be a nightmare because they share the same small lot with other tenants. They take all major credit cards but be advised that anything under 10 bucks, you will be charged a service fee so as much as you can, pay with cash for all orders under 10 bucks. Its not Komex's fault. Its just that anytime you have a terminal for accepting cards, the company that processes it charges the business owner for every transaction. So you see its not a ploy for Komex to make more money. It's more like a convenience fee for not carrying cash. 

They don't have a take home menu for the info you need but you can look it up through their website:  www.komexexpress.com 

So with 350+ reviews averaging 4 1/2 stars, what more reasons do you need NOT to go here?"}
{"text":"Holy, wow. One of the best places I have eaten in Vegas so far. Bulgogi cheesesteak sandwich was perfection, the flavors blended so nicely."}
{"text":"Customer service was great and super friendly! Understaffed however always felt like I was very important to them as a customer. Food came out very quickly however menu was confusing a bit. They have a sign that says the food is made to order to maintain freshness and that it is not fast food however I received my food in 6 minutes and 27 seconds. This makes me question as to if it is really cooked to order or if the food is prepared beforehand. I had the regular beef bulgogi with rice and it was good however I got some cartilage in my meat. The food was really delicious overall and I will return in the near future. I absolutely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Same great food as their original location, but a much more convenient location. The place is bigger and they now have their liquor license. 

Anything from the fusion side of the menu is great. I have yet to try anything on the Mexican side. The beef fusion tacos are my fav. If you're going to dine in try any of the deep fried options like the chimichanga or flautas. 

Prices are still reasonable. You can feed a family of three for less than twenty bucks. It may not be as cheap as their original spot when they became popular a few years ago, but at least I don't feel guilty about paying the minuscule prices anymore. Some of the best cheap eats in town.

Don't forget to download the Epoxy app for their frequent diner card. It'll save you a few dollars down the road."}
{"text":"Came here because I had a craving for Mexican food.  I decided to try KoMex.
First off the customer service is excellent.  They are prompt and very friendly.   The meat used is also very lean, tender, and not fatty at all.    
The meat is marinated Korean style.  

That being said it just didn't satisfy my Mexican craving.  
First off the rice was fluffy, bland  and not flavored as Mexican rice.  The beans also did not seem to have much flavor and was a bit on the dry side.  The chips and salsa they give you while you wait  though was excellent.   It was very fresh and tasty.  I just think I was expecting the fusion to be a lot more Mexican tasting.  

Next time I think I'll will try the Korean side of this restaurant. since the prices here are great."}
{"text":"The food here is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE! Service, prices & portion size are outstanding! My favorite is the Fusion Bulgogi Tostada, Calamari Tacos & Carne Asada Fries (the best in town) but everything is Good! Talk about flavor & deliciousness! If you want a change from the typical foods, you must go here!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way through Vegas on our trip back home to SoCal from Zion. All of us loved it!  Had the pork belly taco and shrimp taco - delicious!!  The kimchee fried rice with spam is the perfect way to make it. Do yourself a favor and check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Bulogogi beef flautas were amazing!! Was skeptical of the fusion of these cuisines, but I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Yeah, the idea of fusion is strange for me. I still have trouble wrapping my head around things like this, but my boyfriend wanted to try it out, and I have to admit that I was curious too.

The menu has three pages: a straight Mexican page, a straight Korean page, and a page of Mexican/Korean fusion items that appear to be predominantly Mexican-based with Korean sauces added. We got two items off this menu: a fusion taco and a fusion chimichanga. We also ordered the bulgogi dish off the Korean menu.

These items are not the most authentic Korean or Mexican dishes you'll have, but they're not trying to be. It's fun fusion food with portions big enough for leftovers. The vegetables in my bulgogi dish were frozen, not fresh. Chicken was pretty good in the bulgogi dish though.

Service was friendly. I would do this again. Strange, but it works."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Great prices! The best thing about this place is the fact that there is nothing else like it. I was very surprised with how well they blended the flavored of Mexican and Korean. Probably will not be back unless I want to show a friend but it was good."}
{"text":"I know I'm going to hear crap for only giving this place 3 stars. The food here is outstanding!!!! But service, that's a completely different story. Been here about 3 times and have had not so great service every single time. 
First time, made the mistake of coming during lunch time. Wait was about 45 minutes but luckily I had nothing planned after and was looking forward to trying a new place. After almost an hour we finally had a table. And after 30 minutes, finally got our food. It was very busy so I understand the wait. Second time, I called in my order since I only had 30 minutes for lunch. Said it would be ready in 20. Got there, still had to wait 20 minutes for my food. The order had not even been started yet. Third visit, came here today with my boss. Came around 1:30 after the lunch rush. They weren't very busy but we felt like they were rushing us to get out. There wasn't even anyone waiting for a table. So yeah, long story short...service is lacking. They have picked up on hiring extra staff which is good. 
On the other hand, food is amazing!!!! The bulgogi burrito is my #1 choice. The mix of Korean and Mexican flavors all rolled into one is mind blowing!!! This is probably what unicorns eat since it's super amazing. If you're feeling like a health nut, they offer the same taste in a lettuce taco. Not really healthy if you eat 4 of them though. The portions are huge and the price is affordable! Since I'm close by, I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I looked through the yelp pics and noticed the pork belly on a stick! I didn't see it on the menu (the little insert was missing on my menu) so I asked the waitress about it. That was probably the highlight of our meal. I liked the burrito too, but the pork belly was the most memorable part of the meal."}
{"text":"KoMex is a nice place for sit in dinning. A great blend of food. I had a order of mixed fries/nachos with chicken and a Korean spicy sauce very tasteful. I will be going back and trying something different to experience more of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is great if you cant decide what to eat, mexican or Korean food?  This place combines the two.  I had three fusion tacos, one with bulgogi, one with pork belly, and the last chicken. They are topped with Asian Cole slaw (kind of like a mild Kim chee) and They were delicious.  They also have traditional items on the menu if you don't want to fuse mexican and Korean style foods together."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times and each time our waitress/hostess was awesome!  Not sure if there was a different waitress that the other review was for, but we've had the same one each time.  The service was good, they were constantly refilling our drinks and making sure we had everything we needed.  

They have lettuce cups for taco shells if you're looking for a lower carb friendly option.  We've had the skewers, lettuce cup tacos, bulgogi burritos, bulgogi chimichangas, egg and spam musubi, nachos/fries... all have been delish!

Closed on Mondays, but their other location is open."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Can't speak to the entire menu, but fusion tacos are maybe one of the best things to happen to mankind. Seriously. And you can get them in a lettuce wrap. Yessssssss.

Additional fantastic things about Komex:

Not only do they bring you chips and salsa but the chips are delicious AND come with a side of guacamole

They have four different hot sauces that they bring to your table and let you experiment with.

Your check comes with a fortune cookie and an adorably cut up orange as a palate cleanser

Did I mention that tacos are crazy inexpensive?!

Did I mention that lettuce-wrapped pork tacos are maybe one of the best things I've ever eaten?!!!!

Also, everyone that I've encountered working here has been completely lovely.

I'm sold."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH!!  Not only was this the cheapest place I had ate at in Vegas, but also by far THE BEST fusion I have ever tried before.

The only thing is... don't count on eatting the food to-go or \"later\" you have to eat it fresh.... Portions are big so order accordingly...

Free Appetizer- fresh tortilla chips and \"guacamole and salsa\" 5.0!! YUMM
Super fries like-- 3.5 ( lack of sauce) but still yummy
Torta- 4.5 needs more sauce guac. or salsa would make it a ++++++
burrito- 5.0 my goodness too good!!!!

Hole in the wall, worth the drive out of the strip.  A must tryyyyyy!!!"}
{"text":"Komex is a Korean/Mexican infused restaurant. Hence KO-MEX. 

I love Mexican food but as for Korean I'm still debating if I'm a fan. But together they make some pretty good dishes. 

My usual order is the Bulgogi fusion fries. Bulgogi is beef that had been marinated Korean style. It kind of has a sweat taste to it. You can also get the fries with any other meat that they have like: carne asada, chicken, etc.

They also have spam masubi w/ fried egg which I think is pretty cleaver. Because we all eat spam and eggs together anyways so why not in a masubi! 

Also when you order a soda they bring out a bottle soda & not a can or from a fountain.

Last visit took a while for our orders to be taken and for water to arrive. But, other times I been here service has been steady."}
{"text":"Great menu, great food and great service. Definitely a place to revisit. Chips and salsa to start with fresh home made tortilla chips.  Quick and fresh food served. The portion sizes are very shareable and as usual our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. The tatertot nachos I will order as my meal next time. If you need a place for a group the place is large with a lot of tables. If you pay with cash you also get a five percent discount on your bill. That's a plus for me. They do accept cards too though. Try it out, I don't thing you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cheap, Korean/Mexican fusion eats....

Small, hole in the wall, no frills joint located in a small strip mall about 10 minutes west of the northern part of the strip (parking is kinda limited).   I love places like this because it means the food will probably be awesome.  Expect a wait since it is a popular place.  While the hubs and I didn't walk away from here all amazed we were full and it did the job.  Service was ok, since the place was full it took awhile for our server to take our order and he didn't check on us after he did.  But we did get our food quickly.

Complimentary chips and guac- good

Bulgogi fries - fries were think and crispy, yum but bulgogi not that flavorful

Fusion burrito with bulgogi- a-ok.  I've had better from the food trucks here in Cali.  Again, bulgogi not that flavorful.

Overall, good place to check out if your'e in the area, I looked around at other people's dishes and they looked good.  But I prob wouldn't make the drive all the way here again next time I'm in sin city."}
{"text":"Just went to the Buffalo location (have been to the Decatur location numerous times) because they're open on Sunday. It was so good, as expected. The waitress (who also works at the other location) was super friendly and on top of drinks. This location is bigger, seems cleaner, and was so speedy! Will definitely be back --- I love both locations!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite place to eat in Vegas. The service is always really great and speedy and the food is so delicious. I've tried many different things but my favorite is the chimichanga and the fusion fries- so yummy. 

I will definitely keep frequenting this place!"}
{"text":"Food was definitely the kind you call comfort food. I got the bulgogi tater skillet and my hubby got the bulgogi torta plus an order of wings. We ate it all!! Yep! That yummy! The skillet was on the smaller side but the tater tots were filling so I can't complain.

The service was nice and friendly. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always one of my go to spots when I need a great bite to eat. Staff is super pleasant and the fish tacos are unmatched! Bulgogi is made to order."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to learn that a Komex had opened up a bit closer to my workplace. Love their food especially the fusion beef bulgogi and pork belly tacos. The Buffalo location is bigger even if the layout is a bit odd. A bar which looks like it will never be used, takes up a large portion of the room. 
This Komex isn't as hectic as the other smaller location at lunch time. However, during my first visit here with coworkers, someone apparently placed a large takeout order which resulted in waiting for our food for nearly 45 minutes. Even made to order food shouldn't take this long. They need to have enough staff to cook these call-in orders in order to not affect restaurant service. We were patient though and their food was delicious. 

I tried them again on a Saturday at lunchtime and the food came within 15 minutes and the service and food were spot on. I had fusion tacos again and my husband tried their enchiladas with different meats. So far so good.

But during my most recent visit on a weekday and lunchtime with coworkers, all sorts of things were off. The water tasted funny and they put the skimpiest portion of pork belly meat in one of my tacos. A coworker and I both asked for kimchi on the side. Hers was a generous portion and was on a small plate, like a true kimchi side dish. Mine? Well, it looked like a few kimchi shavings in a small tin container like what people use to hold ketchup or tartar sauce. I asked our waitress what was up and she said that the kimchi orders are the same (really?) and that there are 2 different chefs that made our items. So I got the short end of the deal then? Sigh. Anyway, our waitress never offered to remedy this blatant inconsistency in the food- which I thought was bad form. Food should be consistent even in the case of two different cooks/food preparers.

So if you're going to eat at this Komex, get ready to play some food roulette."}
{"text":"It's definitely worth the trip to North Las Vegas for this little hole in the wall. Try their fusion tacos in beef, chicken or pork and ask for kimchi on top. Korean barbecue in a taco is gaining popularity and KoMex is the place to go if your hankering for a few of these deliciously cheap bad boys."}
{"text":"I've had this place book marked for a while and finally got the opportunity to give it a shot. I'm really happy I took the time to come in. The service was quick and to the point. I went with the bulgogi nachos ( they came highly recommended by Paul W.). The half size probably would have been enough but I'm always up for a challenge. The meat had a sweet taste to it like Colby beef or teriyaki jerky but it was super tender.

The only minor thing about this place is the size. They are tiny so a large party will have problems getting in here."}
{"text":"Great food. Tried their bulgogi flour tacos, burrito, Mongolian beef. Interesting combination of spices that go well together. If anyone can find a better place for the quality and price in Vegas...do tell! Will be a regular stop when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"these guys are on it!  the food is pretty inventive, even though by now there are many places to get korean fusion around the country.  the food is really tasty.  if you are in vegas and have a rental car, then it is worth it to venture off the strip and visit."}
{"text":"We love Korean and decided to give it a try. We are so glad we did! The prices were reasonable, but the food was wonderful. I was skeptical, but left a believer. The tater tots were amazing! I had all 3 tacos, but loved the beef the best."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service once we got a table. Loved the tacos and nachos. Looking forward to another visit to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"We chose to go the unconventional route and had our 30+ person wedding rehearsal dinner at Komex. Lynda was a pleasure to work with and made things so easy for us. We sent her a menu of what we wanted and an explanation of how we wanted the tables/chairs configured and her and the staff executed things perfectly. They did an amazing job staying on top of any additional orders we had to put in, clearing away plates, and keeping our buffet table clean and organized. 

I frequent Komex regularly and what I was most impressed by was their ability to present us with the same high quality food throughout the night since our party was so large, and they had other guests inside the restaurant that they were serving. We got a lot of bang for our buck here and I'm so glad we could share something we love about Vegas with our out-of-town guests. 

Bonus: they now have a TV inside and since the NBA playoffs were going on, guests didn't have to miss out on the games. 

Now that the wedding is over, I'll definitely be back to Komex for my favorite fusion cheesesteaks!"}
{"text":"Jim's bulgogi fried rice was VERY GREASY!!! Like rice in oil soup. Then we had the fusion tacos, which look good on the plate (we had one of each) for the price they were good, but the pork & bulgogi beef were extremely dry, like they over cooked it. The chicken one was pretty moist &  I would order that one again but this place is very overrated."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing. I love everything about it. The food is great, the price is fair. The selection is great as well. I love the idea of Mexican and Korean fusion, wish I could come here more but living in Henderson makes this place far."}
{"text":"Marketed as a Korean/Mexican fusion joint.  KoMex is somewhat lacking at both of those aspects.  They essentially are a standard Roberto's style restaurant quality that also serves fried rice, noodles (chow mien, etc.) and Mexican entrees with korean style meats like bulgogi, pork belly and the sort.  They also have pork belly saimen.  

I had the kimchee fried rice with shrimp.  All the ingredients were there.   A bit spicy and there was a good amount of shirmp in it.  It was pretty good, but then again how can you mess up fried rice really.  3.5/5

Members of our table ordered the fried fish plate w/fried rice.  A bulgogi enchalada, bulgogi tacos, french fries and the spicy wings.  All of these were of bar grub quality.  Fries were light & crispy but could have used some salt.  The wings looked like buffalo style wings with a touch of Thai chili.  The bulgogi enchelada and tacos were sub par in flavor and there literally was nothing else in the tacos but thinly sliced meat.  No sauce no onions or veggies.  Nothing much stood out. 2/5 overall

The restaurant itself was lacking in ambiance.  Very cafeteria-esque.  Too bright.  Much less inspired than similar places like L&L or Aloha Kitchen for example. 2/5

Not much of a chance for a return visit."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Very good actually! I ordered the bulgogi tacos just to taste it. The tacos were excellent. Also ordered the bulgogi fries, the bugolgi fries were tasty but I could've done without the jalapeños. And I requested a side order of Kim Chee which was laughable due to the portion size. I will return. All in all, very good!"}
{"text":"Unique, eclectic cuisine that is the epitome of Vegas ethnic foods. I've eaten here twice in one week on multiple occasions. Lives up to it's name and does not disappoint whatsoever."}
{"text":"Wow my mouth just had a party and all the flavors are invited! This place is to die for! I just wish it was open on mondays... but you cant get everything you want. This place looks like its going to be just another knock off place but than you get the food and its to die for!!! the tacos were some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Can I get a K? Can I get an O?  Can I get a M?  Can I get E?  Can I get a X?  
What does that spell?  KOMEX!!

What can I say I, this place has over 300 reviews and almost a 5 star average! Is this place great? Yes! It's better than great!  

I had a friend recommend this place.  I said, \"well I like tacos and kimchi.\"  Sounds good.  So we walked in this place with high expectations.  Let me tell you this place lived up to the reviews.  I don't always give 5 stars to restaurants.  They have to really blow me away with the food and SERVICE to get it.  We were promptly seated and our waitress was incredible.  I mean I wish other wait staff would just come observe to see how to do this job.  She went over the menu with us and offered suggestions.  We ordered 9 tacos 2 orders of won tons a basket of fries, and a couple drinks.  Our bill was only $16!  This place is incredible!  Street tacos with kimchi on them.  Every time I have an out of town guest we are going here!  You have to try this place out.  They are well aware of Yelp, which every business should be and they live up to the hype.  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Just left Komex, first time there.  The place is great, value, good people and most of all good food.  You can not eat ambiance.  Had the burrito, saw other dishes and they looked great also.  All the customers were happy.  Will go back when I am in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  Definitely will go back.

It was our first time getting Korean BBQ so they gave us free samples of the meats.  

Cheesesteak was something special.

They made a plain Grilled Cheese for a cranky toddler."}
{"text":"Incredible tacos!!!! Beyond impressed with food quality. Staff was very nice and more than willing to help explain the menu."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome.

Try the fusion tacos in lettuce wrap with kimchee. My favorite is the beef one.

I have also tried the fusion burrito in beef, with kimchee, yumm!

The bulgogi fries were delicious.. 

The kimchee fried rice was ok.

Gotta try it.. I am obsessed with this place =P"}
{"text":"Excellent! I had the bulgogi plate and I was not disappointed. It had great flavor and I highly recommend adding a side of kimchi! So delivious, amazing service and you can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"I've had Korean-Mexican countless times, but KoMex takes it to the next level with the variety of fusion they offer - plus, if you're not feeling Korean-Mexican, you can just get Korean OR Mexican by itself.

I opted for kimchi fried rice with beef (a non-fusion item), and it's a rather generous portion. Not as much beef as I would have liked, but kimchi fried rice usually doesn't have a whole bunch of beef to begin with.

If I came by KoMex again, I would stick with their fusion options as that what makes them stick out (their fusion chimichanga sounds delicious!). The restaurant isn't glam by any means, but it's also quite possibly the most affordable fusion place I've been to, so come with an appetite to chow down."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Couldn't find one thing negative about this place! Great food and great service. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Bulgogi burrito.  It makes total sense.  And the spam musibi - heaven."}
{"text":"I think J would be shocked that I wouldn't rate this higher.

KoMex was on our bookmarked list for a long time, so when we finally got around to it, I guess we just had higher expectations than what we were actually served.

Place was understaffed - just one lady helping out the entire store.  You take pity, but at the end of the day I can't say I'm not deducting a point for that inconvenience.

Parking was sparse, but manageable.  Service, though understaffed and overwhelmed, was polite.

Food took a while to cook, and was alright.  It felt rushed - not sure if D & I will try this place again."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I've been here a few times on a whim and each time has been great. So far I've had: Spam Masubi, Teriyaki Chicken, fusion tacos, fusion burrito, and fish tacos, but there is still SO much more I want/need to try! The Spam Musubi was huge (probably why they call it \"Flintstone\" musubi) and you get two big ones for 3 bucks. The Spam was nice and crispy, but the rest of the musubi seemed to fall apart very easily (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lNZd5fEHGYDhJ-FJYp-oDg/l.jpg); Not a big problem though because I love Spam and rice anyway. The tacos are exploding with flavor and you can't beat the price ($1.29 a pop, really!!?). I've had the pork, chicken, beef, and fish taco. The fish tacos were a little too salty for me, but the rest were amazing. The burrito was also very large, but that didn't effect the quality. It was very flavorful, juicy, and oozing with deliciousness. I ate about half and brought the rest home to my brother who nearly killed it in one bite. 

I can't wait to come back here. Every time we've gone, the service has been very fast and friendly. They even give you complimentary chips, dip, guac, and oranges (after the meal). I wish it wasn't so far from my house, but at least my boyfriend lives down the street from it, so I can get KoMex to-go ;)"}
{"text":"Believe all the hype , this is the real deal, to legit to quit, money in the bank, and your loan has been approved!   Get anything with Kim Chee and be in heaven.  I dont know how they thought this shtuff up, but its brilliant.  Perfect combo of Mex and Korean.  10star food, takeout for me, but amazing!    TOP PICK IN VEGAS FOR ME!!"}
{"text":"Super good. Super cheap. I'm echoing a lot of other reviews. The bulgogi fries are super tasty and super filling. I'm a big guy and my friend is a big eater and we were muscling through a half order. Three ppl would happily share a half order. 

The wings are worth splitting as well. Good flavor, the right amount of crispness without being dry. If you split those you're halfway to full. 

I typically go with a soft taco or two to round out the experience but they have a lot of other stuff besides tacos and burritos. Pork belly and fish and spicy pork are consistent favorites in the taco department and the fish plate itself is actually real good too. 

My only to tip is that they put too much cabbage and pico on their tacos. I just remove half of it before I chow down and eat the excess like a salad. Also eat the tacos as soon as they come out. The cold of the pico will cool down that meat in minutes. AND YOU DON'T WANT COLD MEAT!!!! (unless it's carpaccio)

Half order of bulgogi fries, 8 wings, two pork belly tacos (one flour, one corn), one carne asada taco (corn) for less than $22 cash* pre-tip. 

Also, I know for a fact the bulgogi bowl is good. It's like a less intimidating bibimbap. Also the pan fried fish is great, I like it with some of the fusion salsa more than the sauce it comes with."}
{"text":"This is amazing! Great fusion of the best Asian Mexican foods! Something for everyone. Great service even better prices and huge portions! Must try fusion nachos, kimchi fried rice, fusion sliders! Love!"}
{"text":"Yet another 5 star review. Its in a little bit of a rougher area, but not that terrible. The food is AMAZING!!!! Portions large enough to share.  The prices are almost criminal!!! It is insanely cheap. And when u order water, they give u bottled water, no charge. You also get free chips with salsa and guac. The owners are so sweet! We actually ended up bragging about  komex to some friends who are locals. They promised to go, as should you!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly as you'd expect in Vegas.  Great Food, Reasonable prices, Large Portions, Friendly staff.  Only downside is that they are so popular, you may have to wait, because they are a small family restaurant.  A+ for the Kalbi Fries, Kim-Chee Fried rice and Burritos.  I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout after work, and Komex makes the best fish tacos I've ever tasted!  Generous portions of lightly, crispy battered fish in a flour tortilla and topped with even more scrumptious mounds of pico de gallo salsa, which I also personally topped with a sweet chili sauce that I have at home, yummmers!!!  I have yet to try  their other menu meals, but I don't think I'll be too disappointed if they're half as good as the fish tacos!  ^_^"}
{"text":"This place did not meet my expectations! The concept is really cool but besides that there is nothing really that makes me want to go back there. So sad because I love mexican food and korean food (obv). The restaurant has so much damn potential in name alone, 'komex', but it falls flat.

Just about anything on the menu you can get at a regular Mexican restaurant. There are influences of Korean dishes here and there but nothing that really explores the potential the KoMex genre implies. It seems more like a marketing attempt (a poor one at that) at capitalizing the Korean food craze right now. I'm all up for it but give us something unique, KoMex! There's just no creativity at all.

The interior/atmosphere is a mess. Was it previously an Aloha Kitchen or a Hawaiian bar that was converted to a restaurant last minute? I don't know what I'm looking at with all the coconut leaves. Definitely not even a semi-business setting or a place for couples unless you want to look like a cheap date. At the very least it looks decent for families and friends lol

After spending 5 minutes inspecting the interior and the menu (which was probably designed on Microsoft Word), I got it. They aren't trying to be the next hot thing. You come here to eat decent mexican food, that's it. Whatever imagination you had envisioned in your mind by hearing the word KoMex you can throw it out the window. Appreciate the place for its simplicity and food because FWIW it's not terrible, just not awe-inspiring."}
{"text":"This place is great, I've been here a couple times now and the server is always very polite and attentive and unbelievably friendly. Also the food is delicious. I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Holy cow- pulling into Komex I seriously started to doubt the hype of this place, until I cracked open the menu and saw a large selection with low prices. 

I had the bulgigi sliders and burrito. The two combined cost less than $10! The bulgigi is a very tender meat, similar to a pulled pork. I wouldn't have tried it without the several suggestions from Yelpers!

This is definitely a place I will go back to, more and more to try new things! Bring $10 cash (+ tip) it will be more than enough!"}
{"text":"Felt like I was back in Pyeongtaek, Korea!! Had the bulgogi plate (the 1/2 was more than enough) and it was delicious. Nice price and nice service"}
{"text":"Who'd a thunk to mix mexican style foods with korean flavors... FRICKEN GENIUS!!! 

This is a hole in the wall that needs to be mounted on a wall. Food is always on point from the bulgogi fries to the ghetto ramen (saimin for my island brethren). 
Portions are huge and well worth the price. 

The service is always exceptional. Brittany is one of the friendliest servers I've ever had. Shout outs to her. 

Recommendations:
Bulgogi Lettuce Wraps

{"text":"My son and I decided to try a new restaurant today so glad we found this hidden gem everything was excellent. They had me at pork belly on a stick \"finger licking good\". 

It's safe to say we've found us a new spot!!"}
{"text":"Not fast food, fused food.

Picking up some toys from the \"Toys for Tater Tots\" drive, I figured I should at least take a break and see what this place is all about, I mean, I'm a sucker for any place that serves burritos. 

I went with the \"Fusion Burrito\" with every intention of eating this while driving around Vegas, but when I saw the size of this bad boy I knew this was a sit down snack job. The Fusion Burrito is a monster filled with your choice of meat and Mexican rice, green & brown onions, pico, cilantro, and lettuce. I went with the bulgogi spicy pork and it was delicious, the lettuce was crunchy and the meat had great flavor, but I do feel the burrito had more filler than meat. I need more meat Komex!

I should have gone with the double your meat option and I do recommend anyone to do this when getting a burrito from Komex. Was it good? Of course it just needed more meat and less rice. Plus, the house made hot sauces are the business, seriously, If I was allowed I probably would have just poured the green sauce all over my burrito. Nummy nummers!

A great place for a few beers and a quick bite, but next time I'm running a train on some of their famous tots."}
{"text":"This is the best MexKorean fusion place I've been to in a while.  Next time I im Vegas I will be coming back.  Food is awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent service...  Food was really tasty and alot for your money.  I always make sure when I am visiting Las Vegas this will be a stop on my trip."}
{"text":"I hesitated to give this place 5 stars because it's in the ghetto and the decor is... er... not great.

But... that makes no difference because this place makes some of the most mind-boggling deliciousness at bargain prices. Yes. Korean BBQ and Mexican is one oof the most beautiful marriages in all of culinary history and this place makes the union shine. I nearly wept with happiness at the yumminess of each bite.

There's not much else to say except that this place makes Mexican food (which was good to begin with) new, exciting, and even better than before. If you like Mexican, Korean, or just awesome noms at awesome prices, then you MUST make a pilgrimage."}
{"text":"Def as good as it gets.
Remember, it's a hole-in-the-wall with limited seating serving common-man food.
If you want haute cuisine, go elsewhere.
First night in town, \"Gotta try something new and different.\" We're from Burlington, Vt and while the quality of food ingredients are second-to-none, there are lot of options when it comes to ethnic cuisine. And it can't really get weird, it is Vermont, after all. 
Anyhow, KoMex Fusion sounded adventuresome. Having spent time in Seoul and being a big fan of winter-style kimchee, was looking forward to reacquainting myself. 
First of all, do NOT order a full order of the nachos unless you're sharing with four or more. Half size nearly did me in. I had it with the bolgogi beef. Hope I spelled that right. Good chips, fine bolgogi, way enough cheese. Had the bolgogi beef burrito as a main course.

Let me tell you, one of the finest burritos I have ever had. Ever. Lots of beef, lots of slaw, great flavors. I am not ashamed (well, maybe a bit) to admit that I hurt myself finishing it off. Kept dipping into the hot sauces, little of this, one bite. Well, how about a little of that. Ummmm. How about a little of each. 

Another sign, I did not try the wife's tacos. She might not have let me. 

Looking forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"quantity greater than quality place. 

Pretty good, but I'm not sure if I will go out of my way just to come here again."}
{"text":"Freaking goooood. I love Korean food! This place was fresh and their bimbimbop was legit. It's not a fancy place but the stuff was delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got the fusion burrito and the fusion fries during our visit. He got spicy pork in his burrito and I got pork belly on my fries. For the amount you pay the portion was decent for the fries. They tasted great except I felt like there was barely any pork belly. Also, since pork belly is a bit more expensive than the other meats I expected to receive more. 

My boyfriend enjoyed the burrito and I say it's worth it because it is pretty huge. 

You also get orange slices and fortune cookies at the end of your meal so that's a plus. Overall this place is good."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp to grab some nosh before heading home to LA. It's definitely a solid little spot to try out. Their menu is a little confusing with a lot of items sounding very similar to each other so the yelp photos helped.

 We ordered half orders of the Fushion Bulgogi fries &Chicken Teriyaki but their portions were very substainly sized. I ordered three tacos for myself - Shrimp, fried Calamari, and Pork Belly. I really liked the shrimp and the pork belly tacos... the Calamari taco tasted like a fish taco. Not bad, just not chewy and squidy like I'd expected.

The Bulgogi fries were deliucious! Perfect hang over food - wish I'd paid attention and requested no jalapenos but just ended up picking them off.

I really liked the guacamole that comes with their chips - if I wasn't heading out of town, I would have ordered the 1lb to-go side they offer of it."}
{"text":"Our first time here the food was really good. We had ordered Kimchi fried rice and bulgogi. The food is made to order, and they give a lot! A little pricey but it was worth it especially since I share my plates with my 4 and 2 year old.! Very flavorful foods.

The second time we came the food was very oil and the portion wasn't big like the first time."}
{"text":"Been coming her for years. Family owned and operated. The Bulgogi burrito is my favorite. You will want to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a place best done with many friends so you can share Bulgogi Fries or Nachos. I split a fusion burrito $5.99 and it was plenty. Even the half order of Bulgogi nachos $5.99 ($7.99 full) were enough for two of us. I really like the feel of this tiny place. It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"If my friend hadn't suggested we eat here, I don't think I ever would've known to or wanted to try this place out, especially since it's located so far off the strip. The place is located in a small mall, where the you have to either make a turn in advance or make a U-turn, and to be honest, I was kinda \"eh\" about the place when we pulled up to the restaurant. Once I walked in though, the food smelled SO GOOD! and the workers were so nice and patient with our large group. They were so nice and very accommodating to us, which allowed me to have a great first impression of this restaurant and forget about their slightly tacky Asian themed business sign out front.

They have fusion items on their menu, and they have strictly Korean or Mexican. I tried their Bulgogi Cheesesteak with fries and despite how messy it was to eat, it tasted delicious! We also got Bulgogi Fries to share, which tasted alright to me, but in my opinion, it wasn't anything to die for. I like how you can request to add kimchi to any item we order. I should've added that in to my sandwich!

All in all, food was good, price was right, service was awesome :) I think I'd come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Wow... Amazing!...  A hole in the wall and it's amazing! It does look a little.. cheap.. but the food and customer service is extraordinary. I couldn't complain about one thing so far."}
{"text":"Great comfort food and food  comes out quick ! Love the sliders and good service. When you pay with cash you 5% off the bill."}
{"text":"Y'all are crazy.  I don't know how this place has so many stars.  I was not impressed.  Maybe I just had different expectations of what the food would taste like.  Korean and Mexican...I'd expect some spice.  Everything tasted sweet to me.  I don't think I'd try it again."}
{"text":"I finally got to try the-oh-so talked about KoMex! I love the concept; I especially love Korean food so I was extremely thrilled to try this place out. 

We went here on a Saturday night around 6pm. The place was dead. It was seriously just me and my boyfriend. It was a little awkward but overall I did not mind it too much. A few tables were labeled \"Reserved\" so we were hoping that people would roll in when we were there. We stayed there for more than an hour during our meal, no sign of any other human life form except for our waitress who was super friendly by the way. 

To start, we ordered 1/2 Beef Bulgogi Nachos. It was delicious. The meat was so tender and it was really flavorful. The combination of the sweet sauce blended so well with the pico and jalapenos. We ordered the Bulgogi burrito next and then three tacos with three different meat: beef bulgogi, pork and chicken. All of the meats were cooked perfectly and the flavors were spot on. The burrito was made well in my opinion. You know how when they make burritos, one side has all the beans and the other side has all the meat? Here they make it so that every bite is all the combination of the meat, pico, rice, etc. It was just so good that I was able to finish the whole burrito. And trust me, it was massive! 

I will definitely come back here to get my burrito fix."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place. Reasonably priced, friendly/attentive service, and great food. Don't review much, but this was worth remembering my yelp login."}
{"text":"Would have given 5 stars if they served alcohol and if our server wasn't in training. Place might do better at a container takeout place with dine in sitting.  I ordered the fusion tostada with chicken. It was great. Also ordered the chicken sope. It was ok. Next time, and there will be a next time, I order 2 tostadas. My girlfriend ordered a vegetarian fusion burrito, and its one of the only times I've seen her that please by food she didn't make herself. Coke products are always a plus!!!!"}
{"text":"1. Kimchi salsa
2. Bulgogi burrito
3. Go!

Pros:
   Great Korean Mexican Fusion
   Decent Service
   Decent Prices
   Serves Beer and Soju
   This location EZ Parking and Not Packed
Cons:
   Decor could use a little bump"}
{"text":"This place is really unique and healthy. It's a small place but totally worth the visit. The lettuce tacos are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Yummy Korean Mexican fusion. Big portions and friendly service. We ordered a bulgogi burrito, kimchi fried rice, bulgogi fried rice and a variety of tacos. Kimchi fried rice was my favorite, had plenty of meat and great kimchi flavor. Would come back on my next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great place for spicy Asian food fix in Las Vegas. Got the bulgogi bowl, husband got burrito, teriyaki chicken with broccoli for kids. Kimchi fried rice for all to share. We all loved our food, KoMex has become a necessary stop on our trips to Vegas. Reasonable prices is a plus."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great find. We love the food. The Bulgogi bowl was so delicious. We also had the pastrami and Bulgogi beef on something like a French bread. Both were delicious. Very reasonable prices. Highly recommend. The Bulgogi bowl was the best thing I've eaten in a restaurant in a long while."}
{"text":"I've been here two times since this location opened, and I will definitely be back. The food is incredible and the service is great. The flautas are delicious! You can get a
combination of meats in each of the flautas. I tried the pork, the beef, and the chicken. The pork is definitely the standout though all three were delicious. I love all the sauces they offer. The green one is my fave! I wish they would put it in squirt bottles though to avoid cross contamination from previous customers."}
{"text":"This restaurant has over 500 reviews and has nearly 5 stars so you'd have to be sorta not too smart not to understand that this is a good restaurant. 

The people who run the place seem very nice and are super accommodating. 

It is a little cramped but the tasty food makes up for having to nearly brush elbows with the person next to you. 

When I'm in Vegas, I will be back!

Oh, I had the bulgogi and rice which was delish but I have to say that I did miss all the side items that usually accompany traditional Korean restaurant meals."}
{"text":"I placed a to-go order over the phone and the staff was courteous and the process was easy. By the time I arrived, the food was ready so I was in and out of the restaurant in 10 min.

What I ordered:
-Kimchi fried rice
-Korean chicken wings
-Bulgogi fries

All in all, the food was ok. I probably would bump this up to 4 stars if I had actually dined in because the food (fries especially) were a tad cold. Im sure had it been fresh the bulgogi fries would've been bomb! The sweet and spicy sauce on the chicken wings were pretty good, but I feel like I've had better. 

I would recommend this place because it has a lot of variety, esp. how there's a mix of both Korean and Mexican food. I have yet to explore their \"Mexican\" menu, but tbh there's other Mexican joints around that I don't feel the need to try it out."}
{"text":"A dive, and it's good! 

Seating is very limited - so you may have to wait for a table before you can eat. They do have some chairs you can sit and wait for a table.

They do have 1 large table for a group - which is also screened off for privacy. The other side most seating is half chairs and booth style. The cushions on the booth could use a do over as the foam padding is kinda worn out. That and when I tried to place a package on one of the cushions - it wouldn't stay put, started to slide off the cushion. That's the only reason I suggest re-doing the padding. The cushion fabric is in great shape!

Food wise - Can't really complain! Very tasty! For the tot we ordered Bulgogi fried rice - very mild but good. For my taste buds - would have preferred a little more moisture (i.e. sauce or something), but hubby and child were happy with it as presented. Hubby ordered the Torta, and spicy pork taco. I had two spicy pork tacos. The tacos were surprisingly small - but LOADED to the brim, and overflowing with goody morsels. And surprisingly they were very filling - so I understand the small size. Hubby was extremely happy with the spicy pork as well, and he was overloading with his torta. The only part he wasn't fond of in the torta was the pickled jalapenos. He was kinda under the impression the jalapenos were diced up raw ones, not the pickled ones - so he was slightly disappointed about that. But he picked them out no probs.

We'll be back another day! Have to try the lettuce wrap tacos, and many others! :D"}
{"text":"Definitely try the spicy pork tacos!  Better than beef IMO.  Pork belly tacos also are a winning choice!"}
{"text":"Love the food here!  Bulgogi fried rice is bomb!  Here's a tip- if you're ordering take out, make sure you order on the phone.  it takes a while if you're ordering to go and waiting at the restaurant.  but i suppose its well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Writing a review for Komex Express is unlike most any review I've ever written. Generally I will post my critique of an establishment on Yelp after only one or two visits, but Komex is a different kind of place that deserved a different approach.
 
  Komex was opened for quite a while before I ventured in for the first time. The location that Komex occupies is where one of my favorite Mexican restaurants, El Burrito Café, once stood. This spot is only a few hundred yards from my house so the Komex signs were merely reminders of a food spot that I had literally grown up with here in Vegas. Could this \"fusion\" restaurant compare to the family run Mexican joint I had been so fond of? No way!! Well, maybe I was wrong this time. Komex is beyond incredible!! After stumbling across a bunch of positive reviews on Yelp I decided to go check this place out and there has been no turning back!!

  If you haven't tried Korean/ Mexican fusion you don't know what you're missing. The melding of spices and peppers that are used in each type of food has been mastered by the Yi family. Most items on the menu at Komex (tacos, burritos, etc.) are available with carne, pollo and carnitas and each is equally delicious. The tacos and burritos are all insanely delicious, but the tortas are by far my favorite. They are made with an ample amount of meat (I prefer the carne on these), lettuce, tomato, avocado and jalapeno on a fresh, soft roll. The bulgogi is also a can't miss option if you want to delve further into the Korea side of the menu. I've had the bulgogi as both a burrito (try it with a little Kimchi) and on its own. Both were awesome! Yesterday I decided to try to fusion cheese enchiladas which I was sure would be at least a slight step down from the other fare at Komex, but guess what; DELICIOUS!! BTW, did I mention the prices??!! The food at Komex would be a bargain at twice the price in my eyes. Taste and quality vs. cost puts Komex at the top of any list of restaurants in Vegas for sure. Be sure to try the unsweetened jasmine tea too.

  I would also be remiss if I didn't mention how great the service is. The staff is always very friendly and the service is prompt. Linda is the smiling face that greets every customer that walks in and she sees to it that each patron is well taken care of. I continually tell all my friends that if you aren't making the short trip to Komex, you're missing out on a real treat. Komex definitely on my short list of regular stops for great food!!"}
{"text":"Favorite place for cheap filling calamari tacos.  Th is one of those very well priced Asian fusion places. Great service fast and you wont be spending more than 15 bucks here. 

Calamari fusion tacos: 9/10.  Always cooked perfectly and with a great flavor combination. They will give a bunch of sauces. Try them out! There super delicious. The green compliments this taco very well. 

Fish fusion taco. 8.5/10. The fish is very well seasoned and cooked perfectly. I usually add the spicy red or green sauce for this. But doesn't need it. 

They are definitely other food items to try there. But hands down best calamari taco I have ever had. Have to order them every time."}
{"text":"Honestly, the hype is real. This place is great. They start you off with chips and salsa (which in my books, is always a plus.) my father and I both ordered the bulgogi cheesesteaks with tater tots and they were heavenly. Lots of cheese and onions on top of bell peppers but they definitely do NOT cheap out on the meat. It is loaded with the bulgogi. Very good and cannot wait to come back and try some of their other menu items!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Korean and Mexican fusion so when I saw this restaurant on Yelp I had to try it out. They make the food as it's ordered so plan on spending some time here, especially if it's busy. It is worth the wait. I ordered the tostada with bulgogi meat. The meat was tender and the marinade was delicious. It reminded me of my mother's tapa- Filipino- except that it was sliced thinner. It was served on top of a rice patty, a patty with some crispy rice on the outside. Topped with cabbage and salsa this meal tasted so fresh. I can't wait to go back to try their other specialties!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!! This place is awesome. I've been reading the reviews for this place for the longest time and I finally got to experience the food and I was not at all disappointed. The tacos fusion tacos here are amazing, they had great flavor. 3 tacos really filled me up. Great food and the customer service was great as well. The gentleman behind the counter was very helpful. The only one complaint that I have about this place is that they close way to early.... It's Vegas. 8 pm during the week is too early. This is one of the reasons it took me so long to eat here. Every time I was ready for dinner and wanted to try this place they were closed. I don't usually eat dinner until after 8 pm.  But I will definable be coming here for the occasional lunch."}
{"text":"This review is totally biased. I love both Korean and Mexican food but the two together are TERRIBLE. The best dish solely was just the bulgogi and steamed veggies. I won't return. Service was fine, slow too cook food. Don't come if your in a hurry."}
{"text":"Here at KoMex (Buffalo & Flamingo Rd) for lunch with wifey. Full order of Bulgogi beef fried rice for me. 3 lettuce tacos for her (1beef & 2tofu). Service is decent and friendly. Food is fresh and different. Fusion of Mexican and Korean is a great mix. I have been here before and had the fusion burrito too. It's big and disappears fast when put down in front of me. They give you a little carousel of spices and sauces with the food...tip: the sweet-spicy one is the best.  Prices are + or - 10 bucks per person. I like it and will be back again."}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype but I don't know about 5 stars.  Great hole in the wall and prices!"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff. Waitress was helpful and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the steak tacos are so flavorful. Everything I tried I've really enjoyed.  The service is also very attentive.  If you have not experienced komex go n try it, you won't be disappointed. .."}
{"text":"Why am I reviewing an establishment that already well over 500 reviews?   Simply said, it is because KoMex has to be one of the best hole in the wall establishments that Vegas has to offer.

The kitchen here is very small, and service can be slow. Call ahead if you are pressed for time and budget between 20-30 minutes just to be safe.   However, the amazing food well makes up for the transgression of slower service.  I have yet to have a dish here that disappoints. 

The thing I love most about KoMex is that they are locally owned and have not abandoned the neighborhood, even as it has become a little on the gritty side.  I work very close to here and have a special spot in my heart for this part of town.  

I guess I could best describe this restaurant as \"El Seoul\" food."}
{"text":"I knew about, but hadn't tried the new Decatur location.  I knew all was well when the owner came out and said \"Welcome back--we haven't seen you in almost 6 months.\"

I went with the Bulgogi burrito and my son had the beef burrito.  excellent as usual.  What more is there to say other than that we will be back to try more of the fusion items...."}
{"text":"Wow!

A restaurant trifecta! Good service, good food, original idea.

First, the service. Our waitress was extremely nice and very efficient. I always appreciate friendly service and good recommendations.

Second, an enormous quantity of tasty food. We could have ordered half as much and been completely sated.

Finally, this fusion trend is not new but when it's done right, you know it. The spicy pork torta with jalapenos, lettuce, tomato and kimchi, and the beef burrito with kimchi on the side were full of flavor."}
{"text":"Overall great food.  Very friendly staff.  Their Fusion Bulgogi Nachos are awesome and I really enjoyed the Mexican soft drink in a bottle.  The only thing I thought was unnecessary was the fact that you have to wait to be seated,  and you are waited on by a waiter.  Other than that, I can't wait till they open their next location on Buffalo & Flamingo in Sept."}
{"text":"Wow, exceptional food! Perfect balance of Korean and Mexican. Either one was delicious! I ordered bulgogi plate with a side of kimchi. Bulgogi was well seasoned with authentic Korean flavor. I also shared a bulgogi pastrami sandwich with the hubby. At first I was suspicious, but man I'm glad someone stepped out to be creative and make that sandwich. It was totally bomb!!"}
{"text":"Definitely NOT four and a half stars!!
We ordered bulgogi burrito-- it was only okay at best... Not enough meat, too much rice. Bf felt the meat was over cooked as well. 
We also ordered Korean wings-- I liked them, bf did not as much-- again he felt they were over cooked.  The fries which came with it were frozen fries cooked with no salt-- very little to recommend.
Don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"You have not lived until you have ate KoMex!!! I use to eat at the Decatur location ALL the time and I am super excited that this new location is less than a mile away now! That can be either good or bad :-/ it's not the most healthy food but it for sure hits the spot every time! Tonight I placed a to-go order which seems to be the more efficient and time effective way to get your food without much of a wait! I do know that they are a fresh to order kind of place so it's not like you can walk in and anything on the menu is already prepared! Tonight I ordered the Bulgogi quesadillas and the musubi with spam and a fried egg! Delicious! I usually get the Bulgogi fries but tonight I switched it up! This place is a MUST! If you're looking to order a cocktail they do have a bar in this location which is most definitely a PLUS! Go KoMex!"}
{"text":"The Original KoMex Fusion! When you think of any kind of fusion it always creates plenty room for thought and taste. Mexican and Korean are in my top favorites of foods to eat so when you mix them together? You betcha I'm all here for it. I've been to both locations and I'd have to say the Flamingo/Buffalo location is my favorite.

My most recent experience was this past weekend while I was on this side of town for my nephews track meet. We all know track meets are like all day so my family and I decided we would take a break and grab some quick lunch. Since I'm not really on this side of town I had to pause for a little bit to think \"What is around here to eat\"? Pulled up Yelp and saw that KoMex was like 0.2 miles away and we were sold! The set up is kind of weird at this location in the matter of when you want to place a take out order. The amount of distance between the person sitting at the table behind you while ordering is so uncomfortable

Lunch order consisted of: Spam Masubi, 2 Bulgogi Sliders, Bulgogi Quesadilla,Chicken Fried Rice and KimChi Fried Rice. Everything was fantastic and I was glad to have shown my family another great place when your taste buds want two different types of foods at once! We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Love the food and feel of this place. A well hiden  jewel I've tried about 90percent of the menu and it all rocks! There is a wait for lunch but well worth it, the flavors that just dance in your mouth are great!"}
{"text":"Cheap! Hits the spot. 

It was good homemade Korean food fused with more than decent Mexican food. Another good place to go if you're on a budget in Vegas."}
{"text":"Small place. Extensive menu that touches a few ethnics. Food seemed rather salty. I'd try it again."}
{"text":"fusion yummy. good tasting food. not sure if i went on a busy night or if they were short-staff'ed. a bit slow on the service, but oh well, yummy food."}
{"text":"friendly and fast service.  food was awesome. def try the spam musubi and kimchi fried rice!!"}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for quite some time now & was so excited to try it out in hopes of finding a new favorite Vegas place to eat. I will say the food was good, but not mind blowing spectacular with every bite.. 
I ordered the bulgogi chimichanga, my husband ordered the burrito version and we split bulgogi fries. The Korean sauce was tasty, the meat was tasty. The fries themselves seemed like frozen fries, nothing that great. I also expected more cheese on the fries.. (Shredded, wasn't all melted). The food definitely had flavor I just get the feeling what I experienced wasn't as good as this place used to be (from reading other older reviews). Could use just a tad bit more. some of the food was a little bit/ almost on the dry side. I would love to give it a try again but not sure if we will since it's on the opposite side of town for us."}
{"text":"I must say this place is amazing. We were recommended this place from a local at Costco. Totally worth it. I had the fusion torta and my bf had the fusion chimichanga which were both to die for. On top of the food being bombdiggaty the prices were excellent! Super cheap! We will always pay this place a visit when we come back to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Great mix of flavors, I had the bulgogi nachos with kimchi, the other people at my table were blown away by how good i their burrito was."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing. I have never had Komex before. Enjoyed the komex tacos and did an assortment of carne asada, shrimp and chicken. So yummy. The guacamole and chips where excellent as well. The place was busy during lunch with quick turnaround. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The owners, Linda and Sonny, are very nice. I have tried coming to this place so many times after work, but I always get there right around when they're closing. But closing time is also when you know whether the restaurant is legit or not because if the food is good at that hour, you know the chef cares and is not there hoping just to go home. Even when they're locking or have already locked their doors, they will open their doors for me.

This is what I have experienced with Komex Fusion Express. The flags expressing \"Chinese Food\" by the sidewalk next to their driveway is a magnanimous understatement of their capabilities. Their offerings are much more, although I'm sure a crowd is drawn to Chinese and other Asian cuisines.

If you haven't noticed yet, I only rate 4 or 5 star places, which is why I don't have too many reviews. Not too many things fall on my radar and I do not believe in ruining businesses. Now, to the food, which is what this is all about.

This isn't fast food. Please do not be in a rush when coming here, although they do try to appease fast foodies with their own fried tortilla chips and in-house made salsa.

Bulgogi Tacos: Small tortillas, which show they know the true size of tasty tacos, wrap around some awesome beef with pepper, salt, and some fresh cilantro with a wedge of lime to squeeze on the side. Kimchi should be requested. It's really delicious with the taco, and I'm not reminiscing about Kogi either. The price point is absolutely so low that you know they just want you to share the love of food with them and others.

Won Ton Soup: Fresh thin won ton wrappers embrace tender beef in a broth that was made obviously with care and not monosodium glutamate. This pleased my palate in temperature, texture, and taste. A whole egg was swirled in like in egg drop soup. Freshness is worth waiting for.

Fried Won Ton: The same delicious won ton, battered and deep fried. Frying anything tastes better, but frying something delicious tastes phenomenal.

Bulgogi Fried Rice: I am an ultimate rice monger. I absolutely love rice. When I first saw the fried rice come out, the density of the brown color on the rice made me actually weary, but to my surprise, the rice must have been made with a sweet soy or a mushroom soy because it wasn't too salty, and the tastiness of the pepper, the eggs, the temperature and wok chi of the rice was a perfect blend, lending itself to be one of the best fried rices I have ever had in my 26 years of ricing.

Sauces: Three sauces came out with the Bulgogi Fried Rice. There's a regular chili sauce, a Chinese chili sauce which has fresh cilantro, Sambal Oelek and some other peppers mixed in, and then there's the Mexican chili sauce, which I did not try, but I will be back for."}
{"text":"I always enjoy KoMex! My 1/2 Korean girlfriend & I are foodies and aren't food snobs in anyway but not sure what people expect from a FUSION spot??? They've done an excellent job of bringing our favorite foods together & the customer service is always on point and friendly! Check the photos - they don't lie..."}
{"text":"So I just moved down the street and wanted to give Komex a try. We ordered chimichangas, tacos and flautas. Everything was good but the FLAUTAS were by far our favorite. The only con is too much Pico de Gallo.  But they are a nice twist on the local taco shop. Ordered to go. The Ladies up front are super nice. We can't wait to try out more items."}
{"text":"We heard aboutKoMex from friends and found our first opportunity to visit. We went in for an early lunch yesterday, on Saturday. We were greeted immediately and welcomed, which I like. The staff explain the uniqueness of the food right away. I love the variety of items on the menu. Right away the fusion guacamole and the cole slaw caught my eye.
My husband really enjoyed the full bulgogi plate with chicken and pork and rice. I was very happy with three good sized chicken flautas which came with guac and cole slaw, sour cream and salad. It was enough of a meal to take half home for today ($8).
We know we will be back soon! You have to check out these wild flavors!!"}
{"text":"Heard rave reviews about this place from my brother and some Yelpers.  Went with some coworkers to check it out during a Friday work lunch.  Parking lot is small and packed, had to park behind building on a side street.  Ordered the Bulgogi cheesesteak sandwich and added tater tots for an additional $1.  The cheesesteak was delicious and packed with a good amount of meat.  The fusion aspect worked well with this type of sandwich!  I also like the complimentary chips & salsa that they give you.  A few other folks in my group got the Bulgogi chimichanga and Bulgogi quesadilla..they both looked delicious too!  Overall, for the most part, I think Komex lives up to the hype, and I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"A great find, thanks to Yelp reviews. Delicious and fresh, love the home made sauce. Korean fusion is the best thing that ever happened to Mexican food..."}
{"text":"I finally got to try komex. I had a fish taco, pork taco, chicken taco, beef taco, and pork belly taco. The fish taco was fried. I asked the waitress if it was grilled or fried and I was told it was grilled. That was a minus. The pork, chicken, and beef tacos were all ho-hum. Nothing special. Beef was probably the best of the 3. The pork belly taco was very good. Best thing I ate. Surprisingly, the sauces were really good. I'm thinking try should bottle the sauces and sell them. There were 3 red and 1 green sauce. The reds were super good."}
{"text":"LOVE the flavors in the bulgogi beef dishes. AWESOME beef over tater tots!  Decadent! I don't have locations near me, but it's worth the travel!"}
{"text":"These flavors together are amazing! My boyfriend and I ordered a bulgogi burrito, nachos, a taco and a tostada ... A ton of delicious food (this ended up being lunch AND dinner for two people) for very little money. I even loved the hot sauce, and normally I can't take anything too spicy. A little bit of their regular hot sauce on my food was perfect. However, they said they can make the food much spicier if you ask - so it's a great place for spice-wimps like me, and spice-hounds like my boyfriend (who will pretty much eat ghost peppers and not die). Very friendly staff/owners as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever trying korean/Mexican fusion food and it was a a delicious surprise. I ordered a fusion burrito and fusion nachos and fries with kimchi. The servings are HUGE so make sure you come with a big appetite. I couldn't finish my food and had to take it home. I would definitely suggest ordering the fusion fries with kimchi."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Komex for a long time now and finally stopped in for lunch. I ordered the fusion nachos with the beef and my husband ordered the fusion chimichanga with the bulgogi beef. While we were waiting for our food to come out we were served a basket with chips, salsa, and guacamole.  The salsa was okay but I was impressed with the guacamole. It was a bit more chunky than what I make but had super good flavor!

Onto the nachos and chimi, we were both pleasantly surprised how well the sweet garlicky beef married with the Mexican flavors of the nachos and they didn't skimp on the toppings.  I asked for hot sauce and our server brought out a caddy that had 4 different ones. By far our favorite was the chunky salsa that was spicy and sweet at the same time.  The true star of the show was the finely chopped bulgogi beef,so tender and delicious. 

We will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"First time here a few weeks ago. We stopped in because it's near the house and I kept seeing it on Yelp. I wasn't too impressed with the flavor combinations, but that's just me. I will definitely have to try again to update my review."}
{"text":"Korean and Mexican Fusion, huh, you got to be kidding!!! However, it worked for me and for my entourage. We went on May 27, 2012 and were delighted. I'm a vegetarian so for me the vegetarian burrito infused with Kim Chi was a culinary tasteful experience. 

My entourage, loved their choices as well. 

This is a unique, non-fast food original cuisine that is well worth the experience. I will definitely be a repeat customer.  

In my opinion their prices were too low. They should move to China Town, increase their prices 20% and will still double their business."}
{"text":"Their lemonade is yummy! I had the fusion half fries half nachos and it was so yummy.  My friend loved the fusion chimichanga.  Their spam musubi was delicious and I definitely recommend the cronut for dessert!"}
{"text":"Oh man, I haven't been to KoMex in years, and I still remember when the Korean Mexican fusion cuisine was a hit. I've been to their original Decatur location many times in the past, but this was my first visit to this location.

Food was as good as I remembered it to be. My friend and I started out with a half order of the bulgogi fries. I'm actually not a fan of bulgogi, but these bulgogi fries consisting of cheese, bulgogi, pico de gallo, and jalapeños were bomdiggity! Even the half portion is huge so it can definitely be split amongst multiple people. 

The pork belly taco was simply constructed yet really tasty. The pork belly was really moist and crispy and the refreshing pico de gallo and cole slaw complemented the pork belly surprisingly well. Personally, I would have thrown in some kimchi in there too. My friend recommended me to eat it right away, because the pico de gallo would cool the pork belly down which made sense. 

Their wings were the biggest surprise. I didn't expect much, but it was probably the highlight of the meal for me. Very flavorful, sweet and savory, with enough spice to make your body drop a sweat. Wings can tend to be really dry, but they were cooked to perfection. I will definitely be back for those wings!

The young lady that was serving us was pleasant and accommodating. The owner/manager lady (I think?) even heard my fork drop when she was inside the kitchen so she brought me a new one. Kudos to that!"}
{"text":"No joke. I had a dream about Komex last night. Let's just say, it was my version of Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. Stoned out of my mind, I was chowing down on bulgogi fushion tacos one after another...And then my stupid alarm goes off...F*** me...Coincidentally, this morning my sister insists me to get her a Pork Fushion Burrito after school. 

So I head over to Komex around 1:45 only to find out that they're closed from Dec. 15- Dec. 26!!!!

Ahhhhhh!!! Are you F****** kidding me?!? I totally forgot about that...sigh
But what am I gonna do without Komex for almost two weeks?

In all seriousness, this place is amazing. Not the most ambient of places (what do u expect from a taco shop) but very reasonable prices, friendly service, and just delicious food. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Their fushion (Korean-style) tacos and burritos are one of kind. And make sure you get kimchi added to your tacos or burritos for the extra zesty flavor."}
{"text":"Quick, polite, interesting fusion.  1 star for originality. 4 stars for food overall quality.  Bulgogi nachos are sweet AND spicy.  Give you a large portion so I'd suggest splitting it between 2 people."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the burritos and flautas. Usually when I go there is only one waitress working though so I don't know what it's like when busy. The wings are amazing!!!!! I need to know what's in their sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious beef and the enchiladas and beef with rice is delicious! My husband and I also tried the sweet potato fries which were very good. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great initial idea. Korean flavored beef in Mexican preparations and they do it pretty well. Bulgogi burritos and quesadillas are nice. 

It's a dive joint and maybe I want to much. I wish they would finish the thought and make some Mexican flavored Korean dishes. Carnitas noodle bowls or something"}
{"text":"In Vegas for Memorial weekend and we decided to check Yelp for somewhere to eat lunch.  Decided on KoMex because it was nearby and because of its high reviews.  Great choice!  I didn't even realize it was Korean/Mexican fusion until I opened my menu.  The restaurant is small and was very busy.  Five of us were seated almost immediately, drink order taken shortly after and a basket of homemade chips, guacamole and salsa delivered shortly after.  I shared kimchee fried rice, fusion style flautas, tacos, and spam musubies.  The flautas were my favorite.  Everyone left full and happy. 

Decided to come back two days later before heading home and decided on the Bulgogi tater tots.  I requested a fried egg on top and was happy I did.  It complimented my meal perfectly.  It was like breakfast all in one (tater tots, bulgogi, sour cream, cheese, and a fried egg by request) I highly recommend this restaurant.  Food is great, service is good and will definitely come back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food at fair prices.   Everything is fresh and made to order.  I ate a ton of tacos and wanted to eat more but had to stop myself."}
{"text":"So I got the Komex bulgogi burrito and *gawd damn* that was a big fat burrito filled with luscious bulgogi.  Top it off with a nice Mexican coke, and I was basically filled up for both lunch AND dinner that night."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I had to find this place. Well worth the effort. It is a very small place,but very clean and friendly workers. My daughters and I a had the Bulgogi burritos and it was fantastic. We couldn't finish them so we took the other half home and had it for snacks later.
  The location is hard to find, because it is in the corner of a commercial center. It is located at Decatur and Washington across from Marketon the spanish Market and the burned down Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"Since korean-mexican food is supposedly trendy, we went to check out this new thing based on Komex's rave reviews. A definite hole-in-the-wall, but don't judge a book by its cover. The service is very friendly and their great food comes with a can't-beat price. I order the bulgogi burrito everytime and have leftovers for another meal.

I don't know how, but it just works. It works really well. It's now on my list of top 5 favorite places to eat in Vegas right next to Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"Combining two of my favorite cuisines (Korean and Mexican) is a little eatery aptly named KoMex far away from the Strip. For locals and I, this has remained a favorite spot for their fusionesque approach toward comfort food. 

Sporting a tiny parking lot and a strip mall locale, the low key vibes of KoMex immediately reminds me of places I'd see in Hawaii (the food also screams Hawaii as well). Dated interior with a homey feel, this unassuming spot has family vibes written all over it. Popular during lunch time but a real casual option in the evening, this place gets better and better each time I visit.

Service gets major points for their willingness to please and the family of youngsters are always putting their game face on. They've been polite and welcoming since my first visit and do a good job despite the demand. Management has done well with keeping the food interesting and affordable. Ordering food can be a bit on the slow side, but they've prefaced this by noting the food is made with love.

They've done well with the bulgolgi and I'm certain have created hardcore fans as a result of it. One could rock bulgolgi fries, bulgolgi burritos, or even the amazingly hearty bulgolgi torta. Go next level with the bulgolgi grilled cheese, bulgolgi tater tots or a traditional bulgolgi plate with rice and salad. With this meat, anything (delicious) is possible.

For non-bulgolgi items, I have been enamored with their beef kimchi fried rice. Order a runny egg and take a deep breath when the yolk magically weaves everthing together. While I enjoy the spicy pork rice plate, I also love the pork belly musubi. Nachos with any of the aforementioned meats is highly recommended. 

Don't feel the need to dine in? Go for takeout, but I'd recommend calling in ahead of time. For my fellow hangul speaking friends, this is the antithesis of traditional Korean food, so don't be disappointed when jungols / jigaes are missing from the menu. Instead, come hungry and enjoy one of Las Vegas' most unique local spots."}
{"text":"Tried to go here twice. Both times closed. Won't waste my time anymore. They don't wanna keep a regular schedule they don't need my $"}
{"text":"Very good. Nice flavors. Fresh ingredients. Believe the hype."}
{"text":"Hmm Komex is still awesome, but they have changed up a few things which really put the place over the top since I last stopped by.

Came by a few days ago with Pratik W. and noticed that the whole place looked different. They eliminated some booths and opened the place up which is good!.

But sadly they have eliminated the Yelp check in offer for the free wontons. Really bummed me out - show love to your Yelp fans!

Also, one of things which I loved which was the free bottled water has now been replaced by tap water. They used to serve water in a glass straight from one of those small Costco water bottles, now its tap. I understand that it may have been costly but tap water sucks and they could have at least gotten a Brita as some people do expect this.

But of course the food is still awesome. Great fusion you can't get anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I love the food, super sweet service, and it gets super busy during 6:00- 8:00 Linda is super sweet she keeps checking on us."}
{"text":"The Korean/Mexican fusion thing has been popular for a couple of years now. Some places do it better than others, and KoMex definitely does it right. If you are new to KoMex fusion just remember to keep an open mind. The experience is not like going to a great tacorilla, nor is it like going to a nicer Korean restaurant. It's different, but delicious. The wife and I always order way too much food trying to sample as many dishes as possible. But just like Chief Lone Watie, we always \"Endeavor to persevere.\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csEzTwKemwY
Today Tacodillas were on special. Kind of a taco inside of a quesadilla. Fantastic!
Bulgogi Tacos came next. Also absolutely delicious. And we finished up the night with the massive Bulgogi Nachos. A great meal, with drinks, all for about $16."}
{"text":"Bomb diggity! Vegas secret no more! I'm telling everyone. This place is a great idea and the flavors blend very well. I love the fusion between the Mexican dishes with the Korean flavors. It seems like it was starting to get packed when we were about to leave. On top of being well attended too, and extra food choices, the meal was rather inexpensive! Bonus all around. KoMex, you will be a stop while I'm in Vegas again. Thank you."}
{"text":"Had the bulgogi Tator tots and thought they were pretty good.  Tots were crispy and well flavored.  Prices are reasonable...definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"In my head, the fusion of Mexican & Korean didn't quite click, but was I ever wrong!  This food is fabulous, and we will definitely go back when back in the area.
We had a fish taco, a calamari taco, and the Bulgogi Nachos - oh my!"}
{"text":"Yum!! Love the free chips and salsa... the chips are Amazing and really thick and crispy. The salsa is kinda spicy but it's really really good.

Have enjoyed the beef bulgogi burritos, fish tacos, calimari tacos, kimchi fried rice, spam musubi.  I also saw them featured on a food show recently with Aaron Sanchez highlighting vegas food, cool!"}
{"text":"GET THE CHIMICHANGA! GET THE CHIMICHANGA!

It's a ways off the strip but totallllllllllllllllly worth it! promise.
Found this place through the help of yelp, yeahhh buddy!

Parking: Private lot and I'm sure it helps that there are 3? designated parking spots for KoMex customers! yayy! :D

Service: Is this place family owned? I swear the girl taking my order could care less about being there. She was dragging her feet every direction she had to go. bleh. We were seated as soon as we walked in.. to a verryy dusty table. ): eck. The girl brought the menus right away and gave us a few mins to decide what we wanted. We ordered our food, some chips and salsa/guacamole came and then we realized... we didn't even get place mats! :C which meant no napkins. which means we were just eating on a dusty table. *face palm* -_-'' 

FOOD: Have I mentioned that you should order the CHIMICHANGA?! Well, just in case I haven't... GET THE CHIMICHANGA!
+_Complimentary Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole: The chips were warm when they got to the table and they were DELISH! The salsa was okay but I really enjoyed the guacamole. (:
+_FREE Check-in Fried Wontons!! (; These were sooooo good! I believe they're 4 for $1.00 BUT you can get them for free when you check in :D woot woot! They came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce and were pretty hot in temperature so be careful.
+_Tacos: M'boyfriend ordered one of these babies and it was BOMBB! Juicy, flavorful, warm tortilla, and mm mm good!
+_Bulgogi burrito ( beef with rice, green & brown onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, lettuce, and sauce) : Mehh. I think I HAVE to try it with kim chi next time. It wasn't the head nodding, mmhmm, OMG, mouth full of food kind of experience. However, I will say that it was just as bigg as a chipotle burrito, was still good a couple hours after, and at $4.99 that isn't too shabby.
+_CHIMICHANGA!! (cabbage, onions, cilantro and pico de gallo, topped with Enchilada sauce.) The boyfriend ordered a chimichanga and i was soo jealous I didn't order it! ): PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE order this :D The skin was crispy and it was amazing!

Tips:
+_Check in to get a free order of fried wontons
+_the only thing that has free refills are their peach iced teas.
+_don't sit at a table, try a booth? perhaps they're less dusty.
+_GET THE CHIMICHANGA! it'll be the BEST hang over meal EVER.

I already know what I want to try next! The mongolian beef!"}
{"text":"Oh man, Komex, what an amazing place to eat! If you're not from Vegas, this is a restaurant to eat at. If you live in Vegas, make the trip and at least try it out!

I never heard about this place until I started doing this volunteer program at a school near there. On the way home from there. I was shown this place and I ate there with a group of friends. 

The first time there, I was a newbie and I didn't really know how to eat there or what to order, but my friends just suggested getting one taco of each type of Korean meat. I admit that it was delicious! They put a good amount of meat in the tacos and they overfill it with vegetables. They serve each taco with lime and have kimchi on request. If you've never been here, that's what I suggest that you do the first time to try. But if not, take a look at their menu at anything else that gets your attention. A cool thing that they do is that they serve nachos with salsa and guacamole free in the beginning of each meal and some orange and fortune cookies at the end!

The name is Komex after all, so it's a Korean Mexican fusion restaurant. They have a lot of Mexican staples like burritos, enchiladas, chimichangas, tortas, etc, but with Korean meat! Those would be the main things I would be looking for along with other things with Korean meats. The fried rice and kimchi fried rice are something good to try in my opinion. If you love Mexican food though, the bulgogi nachos or bulgogi fries are the things to try!

The bulgogi fries are personally my item of choice between the two, but people have their preferences. Everything blends well together. The bulgogi sometimes feels like it fits in better, but of course, that again depends on the person. A full order will take a beast or a few people to finish, so if you're by yourself, consider ordering a half order. 

The servers are always very nice people, especially the lady. They are always attentive and more than willing to help you out with menu choices or just any other request you may have!"}
{"text":"I dropped down to a lower rating than I normally would simply because this place does not deserve the 4.5 stars it currently has. At all. 

I swung by this place because I was hungry and figured that I'd go to a local place that was well-reviewed. When other people say hole-in-the-wall, they really mean it. No decor, no real maintenance done to the place in the last twenty years apart from keeping it somewhat cleanish. The place seemed pretty empty when I was there despite it being near suppertime.

The food basically tasted like standard Chinese food. The nachos were pretty good, but the bulgogi was just your standard greasy American style Chinese. I tried some fish, and it was decently seasoned if overly salty. 

With a review of 4.5 stars, I expect a hole-in-the-wall place like this to really really shine on food. This place did not, at all. I might stop by if it were on my way, I was desperately hungry, and didn't mind getting average greasy Chinese food. If I wanted anything else (like, say, good food) I'd go somewhere else. I'm actually suspicious of how the heck an out-of-the-way meh-quality restaurant like this got so many glowing reviews - maybe they're paying for them."}
{"text":"Ordered the wings with fries and chicken on a stick. Delicious food all around, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure this place is worth a trip off the strip if you're visiting.  The idea is novel and sounds great - but the meal was just ok - and with so many great deals and choices around town - it's hard to justify going out of your way to try this place.  I actually have a regular korean-mexican spot that I love - and it blows this place away.  The staff is super friendly here tho - and that alone deserves an extra star."}
{"text":"Our family loves KoMex! Somehow our trip this past week was the first time my husband has gone-a travesty! 
On this visit I did two adobo and two pollo Mexican tacos. So good! I also stole a few bites of my brother's chicken teriyaki.
Mom got some wontons for the table to share. That wonton sauce is ridiculous so good. Sweet and sticky-seriously perfect.
The hubs did a few Mexican tacos and a quesadilla, and he ate every bite. All around it was an awesome meal for the whole family, and their service is always great. We have been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"KoMex was awesome.  Just what you'd expect with a Mexican/Korean fusion description.  Nachos with kimchi and bulgogi, tacos with Korean dressing, Korean burritos, and more.  It is all very affordable, very delicious, and very spicy, if that's your thing.

The service was a little slow but the meal was very solid.  They serve you some pita chips with salsa to begin and give you a great variety of hot sauces from Mexican to Korean in tast and hotness to choose from. Note: this location does not serve alcohol but the other one does.  I recommend the pork belly tacos with flour tortillas or lettuce wraps. ($3ish for 1).  But I bet everything is good here."}
{"text":"Awesome fusion food. Try the fusion tacos. I like the spicy pork or the chicken. They say it's not fast food but you can still order it on your lunch hour. I've always gotten great service, I think it's the owner."}
{"text":"Order a variety and share. Loved the Calamari, Shrimp, and Fish tacos."}
{"text":"You may not be impressed with the decor but you will be impressed with the food .
Make sure they bring you the homemade Korean hot sauce so up can put it on everything .
I had slider 3$ tacos 2$ ea and three meat skewers $7
All were good and had complimentary chips and salsa to start and orange slice and fortune cookie at the end.
Friendly service and family friendly dining."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now-- twice for dining in, and most recently for take out. For a quick bite to eat, without being fast food, this is definitely my go-to place. 

Last night, I ordered three sets of wings (savory sweet, and spicy-- almost as good as my Mama's!). Everything there is made to order, bit since this was an off-peak time, the order only took 15 minutes, at most. Service was fast and friendly. 

Don't be intimidated by this homely little shopping center near the corner of Washington and Decatur. The businesses are very friendly, and seem to all look out for each other, and their customers!"}
{"text":"We don't come here nearly enough. But every time we do we are never disappointed. The burritos, fried rice the free chips and salsa as you wait for your order, everything is super tasty. As a person of Mexican heritage I am happy that someone had the idea for this fusion!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Food was delicious. Service was great. Nice friendly family run restaurant. 

Must try bulgogi flautas!"}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is even better. The Fusion Bulgogi burrito is my favorite item there. Its huge, so bring a friend and split it! Then you'd have room to try the other fusion goodies. I highly recommend trying the tacos, either fusion or traditional. 

Check-in into yelp and receive free fried wonton, which in itself were delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is my husbands favorite restaurant. He lived in Korea for two years, so he's very picky about his bulgolgi. We love the fusion flautas, fusion nachos, and the awesome service that never fails."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! The interior is quirky/casual, but the food is mind-blowing good."}
{"text":"Great food and flavor and the bulgogi had an awesome taste. The staff was friendly and its great food with a great price. I recommend the bulgogi fries to everyone"}
{"text":"This is place is bomb! Food is definitely great and tastes delicious! Lots of choices too!"}
{"text":"Great food! Nice cozy spot, across from ford, the first time I came here I was getting my car worked in and I was starving, I ordered so much food and was not disappointed. Love this place, going to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Komex is still killing it. I bring a deathly looking angry korean with a hangover from hell to finally try this joint. For her....not da bidness yo... 

I look on the menu and the Ghetto Style Ramen is not on there. Double Sad Face...    :(     :(     If you're in the know, they will still serve you this item.  YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEH!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be completely honest. I loved the food. I wish this place was located in my hood of Los Angeles!! Minus two stars for the absolutely abnoxious waitress. :)"}
{"text":"The Fries! Get the Fusion Fries!

This place was a PERFECT blend of Mexican and Asian fare. The fusion dishes are really creative and they blend together in perfect Korean-Mexican fashion. The place is not fast food, it is very high-quality food, but you still won't wait long for your meal. I think it took less than 10 minutes for all our food to come out, and we ordered a lot.

The fusion fries were my favorite, and a half order is big enough for probably 3-4 people. The pork lettuce wraps were a great appetizer, they had a little pico from the mexican side, and the meat was from the korean side. Another perfect blend. The bulgogi chimichanga was huge and delicious, and you definitely can't go wrong with this order.

I was very happy with everything I ordered and really want to go back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing KoMex since summer of 2012 and I finally got to try this past trip. Better late than never. 
Even though it's a bit of a drive from the strip, I am so glad we made it out (then again I wasn't the one driving... Thank you P!) 
As per many yelpers' recommendation, we tried bulgogi nachos (with kimchi on the side), Fusion Flautas, and spicy pork kimchi fried rice. 
I love Korean Mexican fusion. So. Good.
We order the half size bulgogi nachos and that was plenty for the two of us. Their home made chips were great and they were not stingy with the toppings. I could eat this all day long.
The flautas were also delicious. Bulgogi plus cheese rolled in flour tortillas and deep fried. What more could you ask? Gucamole you said? Yes, they come with the flautas and were fresh and excellent! We were really full already by the time the fried rice arrived at our table. I had a couple bites, but the flautas definitely had my heart. My friend though on the other hand couldn't stop eating the fried rice even though he was really full. 
They also have 4 different kind of salsa. I only got to try 3 of them because I was too busy stuffing my face with everything else. The green one was alright. Not too memorable. But the other two that I tried were amazing. One of them kind of remind me of the sauce Kogi truck uses. It has a nice balance of vinegary and spiciness, except the one here has an extra kick at the end. The kick at the end is pretty strong. The other one is on the sweet side, and if I could I would steal their salsa home. Remember to grab the salsa containers when your complementary tortilla chips arrived!"}
{"text":"I do like the food here and it is a good price, but nothing really tastes that Korean to me.

I have had the fusion flautas, the cheesesteak, and a fusion burrito."}
{"text":"If only this place was closer to where I lived!

Anything with the word Bulgogi here is amazing. I had the burgers and it was just an amazing mouth watering experience! It's kind of like if Roberto's met a hole-in-the-wall Korean joint.

You have got to try this place!"}
{"text":"Do not let this place deceive you by its looks!! The best ever collaboration of Korean and Mexican food!! I've been coming here for years. Best bulgogi tacos and their guacamole is the best!!"}
{"text":"When walking in, I was greeted and promptly seated. After browsing their many delicious sounding options, I decided on their beef bowl. It was GINORMOUS. This was the largest \"bibimbap\" I have ever gotten and at a much cheaper price than your average bibimbap. It was delicious and hit the spot. Extremely attentive service the whole time."}
{"text":"I'm half Korean and love the fusion concept of their items.  I tried the bulgogi burrito with a side of kimchi and my husband had the dak-bulgogi enchiladas...... Delicious!!! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Had the bulgogi plate (chicken and beef) last night while while my love had the chimichanga. My plate was delicious: big portion and lots of flavor in the meat. My love had no complaints about his chimichanga...service was great and the waitress was very attentive. They have a big selection of Mexican/Korean fusion dishes - I gotta come back and try their flautas :)"}
{"text":"Super yummy and non fast food! Fast service and excellent quality! Mexican fusion! Love love love!! Service is super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Mouth-watering, delicious, Korean-Mexican fusion.

I could make a meal out of their Fusion Bulgogi Nachos (even in its half order size), and their prices are so reasonable you can never turn this place down.

It's a hole-in-the-wall sort of setting and the water they give you in your cup is from large, gallon, filtered water bottles. AWESOME, considering that Las Vegas' tap water is bad enough to ruin any meal. (IMO)

I have returned to this place numerous times with my boyfriend (who is very hard to please, food wise) and have always had a great experience.

Their Fusion Tacos are so good! I always opt for the spicy pork. I've also tried the Fusion Burrito, and the sheer size of it even made my boyfriends' mouth drop. 

I love Fusion spots, and this, right here, is the epitome of a fusion flavor explosion!"}
{"text":"I can definitely see hubby and I coming here over and over again! We read all the great reviews on this place so that's why we decided to make the trip out here. Chips with salsa & guacamole was great! Their tacos were da bomb dot com :P Tried the bulgogi (beef) taco, Daeji-gogi (pork) taco, and pastor taco! All soooo yummy and cheap! Everyone should check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! I have been dying to try this place! I ordered the bulgogi nachos and it was a lot of food! The meat was juicy and the ingredients were amazing. 
The komex sauce is a must try. 
I also usually hate coke but I tried the Mexican coke here, wow that's actually good. 
Mexican coke is waaaaayyy better than American coke that's for sure! 
I heard it's made with real sugar and that's why it tastes better.
Order the nachos for sure if you're craving some interesting flavors!"}
{"text":"OMG KoMex! Korean-Mexican fusion? Genius! KoMex is quite a ways from my house but their food's so good I don't mind driving half way across town for it. The restaurant is a little small and the decor is just regular, but that's not important. The food is what's important. They offer chips with salsa and FRESH guacamole to snack on while you wait for your order. I'm a big fan of carne asada fries so when I tried their bulgogi fries it was just heaven on earth. It is the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. The bulgogi burrito is also very good but I rather prefer their fries. Every one needs to try this place, it's inexpensive and it's just really that good!"}
{"text":"To be fair, a buddy recommended this and raved over this. I had to try this - first - it's in a really iffy part of town, so for me lunch was the only time I'd go here.  Tried the fried rice, bul go gi sliders, and a bul go gi burrito. For me the attempt at fusing Mexican and Korean was not a successful one. The flavour was okay but not nearly as spectacular as my buddy thought it was.  Unfortunately,  I didn't see the appeal of mixing the two types of foods together - at least on the dishes we had.  So unless you're really craving Korean and Mexican combined, you can go elsewhere to experience good food. Place also fits the surrounding neighbourhood - aka a dive more or less (which I'm used to with other Asian places but with much much better food)."}
{"text":"Actually kinda shocked... When I first got in I thought the combination made no sense to me... Restaurant without an identity... I was ready to yelp badly..... However the food was quite tasty and not too overpriced... They could use some help on their decorations..... Shrimp tacos were excellent and bilbogi was great.... Totally recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Where have I been during this KoMex kraze? Eating tacos and bulgogi elsewhere, I guess. It just didn't occur to me that I could've had both if only I visited KoMex, but better late than never, right?  The numerous close-up photos of Fusion Bulgogi Nachos alone are enough persuasion to visit. Unfortunately, my first visit was also my last.

I ordered the fish taco and Fusion Bulgogi Taco, and my friend ordered the Fusion Bulgogi Enchilada. We also requested a half order bowl of Fusion Bulgogi Nachos to share. Our waitress was kind enough to warn us that the full order might be too much, so we went with the half instead. She's right. The chips are enough to share with four people. Then again it all depends on everyone's hunger levels.

Our waitress started us off with a complimentary basket of hot homemade tortilla chips with side of guacamole and salsa. Very delicious and not greasy. They're thick and resemble pita chips. A fantastic start to our meal. So far so good.

We both were expecting our nachos to arrive first to tide us over as we waited for the arrival of our entrees -- we had both fasted for this visit and were really hungry! -- but that didn't happen. Instead, my friend's enchiladas arrived first followed by a short awkward period of waiting for my tacos and our order of nachos to come. Our entrees arrived warm instead hot, so that made us wonder if the food had been sitting out for a while before being delivered to our table. 

My fish tacos weren't bad, but they're certainly not the best I've had. Here's what I like about their fish tacos:

- The fish isn't tiny and it's lightly fried.
- It isn't slathered with thick specialty sauces.

The bulgogi tacos were tasty, and I enjoyed the sweet flavor of the bulgogi meat. I would've preferred a flour tortilla over the corn with this taco. 

Fusion Bulgogi Nachos is a mountain a tortilla chips topped with mozzarella cheese, bulgogi, jalapeños, and a spicy sauce. Although delicious, when it arrived the cheese had cooled down and began to harden. 

The meal was going well until I noticed my friend doing something unusual. At first I thought she was playing with a string of melted cheese that was hanging from one of the chips, but she was actually trying to move something. She pointed out a small black bug crawling on our table near our chips. We both thought it was a gnat but it didn't fly away. It couldn't had been a spider because it had  antennae and didn't crawl on eight legs. Rather than guessing what it was and where it came from, we stopped in the middle of our meals, paid the bill, and left with nauseating feelings in our bellies.

The cheap and decent eats would've brought me back for another try, but I don't think I can stomach the idea of returning."}
{"text":"I came to this place after watching a video on Buzzfeed about hangover food in Vegas. I wasn't hungover when I went, but the food was delicious nonetheless. I had the chimichanga with bulgogi and kimchi stuffed inside--that thing kept me full for the entire day. Super tasty. I had no idea this place existed until this year, but I'm so glad I went. Will definitely try the fried rice next time. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Whoa! This is my new favorite hole in the wall. It's currently in the middle of a tiny carneceria but they are moving by the end of the year. It sounded like they might be planning on becoming an actual restaurant, rather than a grocery counter with food.
Mexican, Chinese, and Korean food. Huh!
The owners are Korean, but they speak Spanish. Linda, the owner, said her husband was cooking her some food and everyone was interested. And their fusion food was born.
I started with a bulgogi taco. I think I prefer Hanshik BUT...the taco was $1 and muy delicious.
I then got a bulgogi teriyaki bowl and a pork tamale to go. The teriyaki bowl was $5 and the tamale was another $1. That food will probably last me for 4 meals.
The teriyaki bowl is delicious. I mean, best teriyaki bowl I've ever had. Yum. Yum. Yum!
And the tamale was even better than the teriyaki bowl! 
I freakin' love this place. Cheap, delicious, creative, good eats. I couldn't ask for anything better.
I will be back..again and again.

Edit:
This place has moved and is now a full-time restaurant, rather than carniceria with a food counter.
If you're looking for atmosphere, forget it.
If you're looking for delicious comfort food, go check it out!

I haven't eaten everything on the menu (yet), but most everything I've had seems to have Korean influences, which makes sense given that the owners are Korean.

I got some wonton soup today. It's really not much like traditional wonton and Korean flavor peeks through....but it's delicious, comforting, and a bargain.

The tacos are now $1.25 and still muy delicious! 

I came in for takeout, but Lynda still brought me out a side of chips with salsa and guacamole. The chips were kind of soggy in the middle like homemade...and that's the way I like my chips, but others might disagree.

Still, a ton of food, and a ton of flavor, for very little money. And I still love this place!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this to place to all of the fusion lovers out there! 

Variety
Not only do they have fusion menu that combines Korean and Mexican, but they have separate sections of just Mexican, Asian, and American.

Price
All the items are reasonably priced!  Tacos at 1.65 and entrees about 5-8 bucks!  All three of us ate for 16 bucks!

Menu
If you dine there, they give you free chips, salsa, and guacamole.  I ordered the bulgolgi taco and the pork taco with kimchi on it.  They were pretty hefty tacos for what you pay for them.  We also got the 5 friend wontons for 1.50.

I can't wait to go back so I can try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Wow just tried the kimchi fried rice and it was fantastic. I called and ordered for pickup and it was ready on time. Thanks, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this Korean Mexican fusion spot! My favorite is their Spam Kim chee fried rice and their fish tacos is to die for! They also serve salsa and chips which so addictingly good and at the end of every meal they give you a piece of orange!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing! The parent restaurant (Komex Express) is just as good if not better. I was doing some research on the previous yelp reviews posted and one customer feels that this is a let down compared to the other location. I do not agree with that comment since the original chef from Komex express works at this location, and all of the meats are marinated on site and delivered to the Decatur location daily to keep the flavors consistent. So how could the two restaurants possibly not compare?! This continues to be my favorite weekly dinner spot and I'm happy to see that the new location is a success. My compliments to the owners for another success!"}
{"text":"At The very first time I was here I was literarily can't stop going here to this place! 

But the last time I was there with brother in law/friends and it is their first time coming to this place since they visiting from other state and they always hear me talked about this place all the time so they asked me to take them to komex express, so of course I take them here BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE ON THIS DAY!!!

The owner WIFE/CO-OWNER/SERVER WAS SO RUDE! I ASK EVERYTHING SO POLITELY BUT HER RESPOND WAS ALWAYS RUDE, GIVING US SO MUCH ATTITUDE AND ALSO ANGRY FACE!

First of all this place need to hire a server BESIDE THE OWNER WIFE! Since she is the only one can speak English!!!

I asked for water from the Hispanic worker he couldn't understand me and ask the owner wife and she come to our table with AN ATTITUDE!!!

WHY ARE WE GETTING THIS WORSE SERVICE EVER WHEN I WAS ASKING HER WITH PLEASE THIS AND PLEASE THAT! 

SHE IS NOTHING BUT SO RUDE WITH RESPOND, RUDE SERVICE AND UNPLEASANT/ANGRY FACE THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE THERE!

EVEN THO WE HAVE A BAD SERVICE WE KEEP OUR CALM AND MY GUEST FROM OUT OF TOWN WAS DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ETC!!! 

I SHOULD HAVE NEVER GIVE THIS RUDE FACE LADY A TIP AFTER ALL THE BAD THINGS SHE DID TO US ON THIS DAY, but a nice person that I'm I still leave her a tip and leave this place with a thank you to her!


I WILL NEVER EVER RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE TO ANY OTHER PERSON LIKE I DID BEFORE AND NEITHER WILL MY GUEST FROM OUT OF TOWN WILL VISIT THIS PLACE!

THE OWNER WIFE WAS TALKING TO ME BEFORE ON HOW SHE CARES ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMER AND WILL ALWAYS GIVE AN EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE TO EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER!

OBVIOUSLY HER WORD DON'T MEAN ANYTHING WHEN HER ACTION IS THE TOTAL OPPOSITE!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite fusion restaurant.  The burrito rocks .... better then kogi truck in LA imho."}
{"text":"Hands down best Korean/ Mexican fusion food in town. Bulgogi bowl and their hot sauce, 10/10. Can't stop returning for more. Never forget about the tator tots, maaaajor key!!!"}
{"text":"I would work for free for the rest of my life I could eat their nachos every day!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a little while now.  So when we had visitors in town that wanted some Mexican food, I thought what a perfect time to come check out this place. Although it really is off the beaten path for me, it was worth the trip to experience what Korean Mexican fusion was really all about.  The waiter brought out complimentary homemade chips with guac and salsa dip to start our night out.  We ordered the bulgogi burrito and kimchi fried rice and our friends had their fusion tacos.  Both dishes were quite good and fulfilling.  The portion size is huge and the ingredients inside were very fresh.  Although the bulgogi could have been more flavourful, their special house sauce and other hot sauce condiments really made the burrito stand out.  I really enjoyed this fusion restaurant, but because it is so far away from me, I think I will only be coming here if I am in the neighborhood for some other reason.  I took one star off because I had to ask the waitress for a knife to cut the huge burrito and extra plates so we can share our dishes."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time trying fusion and this place does it so well! I ordered the chimichanga and it was amazing. I also love all the variety of salsas/sauces that you can choose from. My boyfriend ordered the KimChi Fried Rice with combination of meats that was decent as well."}
{"text":"this place was really good! i had read a few reviews just to see what to order and my group of 6 had 3 orders of everything they wanted and nothing disappointing!! it was all flavorful. the place looks dingy but dont let that detour you. the owners are VERY courteous and help with any thing they can.

A MUST GO. off the vegas strip great food!"}
{"text":"My first UYE event and it so happens to involve an eating contest! Okay, bring it on! 

The service is friendly and fast. Lots of smiles on hardworking people can only mean that love is being poured into these delicious bites.  That's right I said it! Delicious bites! 

My favorite of course are the bulgogi beef tacos with a healthy cabbage slaw topping on some delicate corn tortillas! The grilled pork and chicken tacos were very tasty as well. Also, a large selection for bevrages  occupy a commerical slider fridge to the left of the restaurant so fear not if you take on too much salsa!  I am proud to say that I ate 5 whole tacos but not anywhere close to the amount of tacos Eric, Jen, Danny and Gabe ate.  I met some really cool people and I made out with a cool Komex T-shirt for being the only female who attempted this beast of a challenge. On a side note I'd reccommend checking out these fun Yelp events in the future.

I do recommend eating early at Komex because there is a nice crowd for dinner that pulls through and seating can fill up quickly.  Who'd of thought Korean and Mexican cuisine could match up perfectly? I guess Komex did!"}
{"text":"What a surprise! The food was excellent.
Seeing the place from the outside and the plaza brought serious doubts about coming all this way to eat in this place. Boy was it worth it!
Korean-Mexican fusion is something you are not likely to see often, especially in a small place that looks as if it only does take away!
We ordered fusion tacos, fusion burrito, fusion quesadilla and fried rice bulgogi.
The best was the burrito - it was stellar! I would have skipped the quesadilla - in such a place I rather fill my tummy with better things than molten cheese!
Service was extremely nice."}
{"text":"Amaaazing!!!
Korean and Mexican marriage is phenomenal!!

Ordered the tots with bulgogi - sour cream sauce with bulgogi and pork and scallions and bacon- heeeaveeennn

Bulgogi cheesesteak- knock your socks off delicious!! Super cheesy and flavorful you will be pleasantly surprised

Chicken wings- crispy. Spicy. Sweet. Delicious!!!!

Bulgogi bowl- so friggin good - the cole slaw and spinach salad with rice is crispy and refreshing with the rice and fatty and flavorful bulgogi beef!!

Tacos- great! Ordered the pork tacos nomzzzz

Will definitely be back everything was so reasonably priced!! Delicious and awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought the best grilled cheese I've ever had would have come from a burrito place... and a Korean/Mexican fusion burrito place at that. 

Seriously, the grilled cheese is three dollars and is the best I've ever had. Bulgogi beef, melty cheese and sourdough. Where has this been all my life? 

Other appetizers than the grilled cheese included short ribs and some sort of fried fish, which were good but not great, but maybe had an unfair shot being put up against the grilled cheese... which i think i mentioned was pretty good.  

As far as the actual specialties... the fusion burrito is a combination of what you would find in a traditional Burrito (rice, lettuce, cheese etc), but with Bulgogi beef and kimchi (ask for it inside). Throw on on spicy fusion sauce and you've got something that makes you wonder why this \"Komex\" country doesn't actually exist, if only for the food.  

Service was good, prices reasonable. Only drawbacks are

1. The inside feels something like a mix between the DMV and a classroom
2. Chips and salsa/guac seemed like an afterthought - but hey if you are giving it to me for free I will not dock you for it."}
{"text":"No fuss. Asian fusion. Comfort food. Fast. 

My fiancé and I decided to try this place out after having this place bookmarked for quite some time. We came in around 3pm and we got seated right away. We ordered the bulgogi fries, kimchi fried rice with pork and combo plate of bulgogi and spicy pork.We also got the free chips and salsa/guacamole. While we were devouring the chips, we decided to try the 4 different hot sauces that they have. One really stood out, it was like a combination of salsa and the Korean chili sauce, super yummy! 

When the food came out, we killed them all fairly quickly. We were already starving by the time we came in. Kimchi fried rice was definitely the star out if the things we ordered. It was very flavorful and had just the right amount of spiciness. The combo plate was just ok and a tad on the dry side. Bulgogi fries was pretty good, especially with the awesome spicy sauce added to it. We ordered all small sizes because we know that we won't be able to eat all of them in full sizes. The overall experience was good, the server was nice and the food came out pretty quickly. We were in and out in less than 35 minutes! That showed how hungry we were ;)

I'd definitely come back again. The only downside is that the location is quite far from the strip."}
{"text":"Hurts me, seriously, it PAINS me to give 3 stars. I want to give 5. But the truth is, it only deserves 2!

I absolutely LOVED the orginal Komex. LOVED IT. I loved the fettucine dish, the calamari tacos, the quesodilla. All soooooo good. I figured, since it's the same owners, just a new location, it will be the same food.

WRONG......Nope. Not at all. 

It seems like all the flavor that makes Komex stand out was GONE here. No love man, no love. My fettucine dish was boring. There was nothing there. Barely a hint of the spices that make it taste so good. 

Maybe, just maybe it's because we ordered it to go. 

This place FINALLY shows up on my side of town...awesome!......only to find it is just eh, I've had better.

I will try it again, and eat in this time. I'm looking forward to bumping it up to the 5 stars I think they truly are!"}
{"text":"5 star for quality, quantity and service. Hands down. I had the fusion taco with flour tortilla, vegetarian. My husband got the fish taco. I have to say, it was no doubt, the absolute BEST taco I ever had. Can that even be called a taco? Not for what I know as a taco. I know ground beef, or for me, ground seitan, lettuce, tomato, cheese and sour cream. I can't even explain the wonderfullness of this taco. It was fresh, crisp,  tasty and amazingly delicious. The fresh cilantro and scallion on top of the 2 types cabbage, pico and grilled veggies' was mouth watering. My husbands' fish taco was melt in your mouth fantastic. I loved both of them. So completely different in taste, but equally delicious. My sister ordered the carne asade, which I didn't taste, but it looked really good. The service from Linda was spot on. I appreciate her coming over and asking how I'd like my vegetarian meal. Did I prefer grilled veggiee's or fresh chopped? It's so nice to get that kind of personal service. Oh, I got the torta as well. OMG! It's sticky rice that's lightly fried so it's super crunchy. I, again, got the vegetarian. But I kept thinking, if I got the teriyaki beef on this, it would be out of this world! The starter of fresh chips, guacamole and salsa was yummy. The fact is was free....priceless. I had the unsweetened ice tea, delicious, and Linda was saying since she doesnt like tap water, she doesnt serve tap water. Anyone who orders water with their meal gets bottled water, free. LOVE IT! I was extremely impressed with the menu and after eating my meal and having a few days to digest, I'm dying to try others! I can hardly think of anything bad to say, but everything has something to make better so here goes. It's location is.....to be desired. The bathrooms are....disappointing. That's it. When you get past this, you will be talking about this meal for days to come. For me, it's day 3 and I haven't shut the hell up!!!
Enjoy. It will be a delightful meal that you will be telling everyone about. Me? I'll be back Saturday with friends!
For the record, I am happy with my review. However, after reading, my husband feels I am harsh with the bathrooms. Here is the truth. I didn't go in. My husband and sister did and both came out saying it was kinda gross. Nothing to take away from the awesome meal, but not good. So, that is why I said what I said. There was also a 30 minute conversation on the way home about the bathrooms. My husband and sister aruging that since it's a rented place, they can't invest in making the bathroom better. They say there were as clean as they could be. Anyway, I loved this place. The bathroom has no bearing on my opinion of this place. I only pointed it out because, any place, and I mean, ANY place, can always be better."}
{"text":"You want a fusion of Korean and Mexican food at an outrageously reasonable (almost feel guilty it's so inexpensive) price?  Komex is the place!  When you are seated, they give you chips and salsa/guacamole.  You can tell the chips are homemade, and not store bought.  I ordered the Bulgogi Burrito and Fusion taco with green tea.  The taco was very tasty.  The meat is sweet and combined well with the coolness of the slaw.  They have their own Kimchee salsa that goes very well with it.  The Burrito was Huge.  I always finish my food, but I could only eat 1/2 the burrito.  Again, the meat was sweet and mixed well with the spanish rice and Kimchee salsa.  The entire bill was only $8.50!  The burrito was under $5, the taco was $1.35 (or something like that).  Well worth the price and well worth the trip.  The owner was extremely nice and the service was great.  Try it if you are in that part of town."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about KoMex Fusion so when a new location opened up near me, I wanted to give it a try. The place was packed, but luckily there were still 2 open tables to choose from. I have no idea how many employees were in the back, but I only saw the same two girls working the whole time and they were doing a fantastic job at keeping all of the tables taken care of. Our server took the time to go over the menu with us and suggest things we might like try. 

After my \"Mexican Coke\" was brought to the table some complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole soon arrived. The guac was fresh and delicious! The salsa had a nice fresh flavor too. Hubby and I decided to order a few different things to try buffet style between us. 

Fried Wonton's ($1.50) - These came 5 to an order and were good! They were stuffed with green onion, ground beef & pork. The dipping sauce that came with it was sweet and yummy. 

Chicken Flauta ($2) - The flavor was very good and I can't even describe it, you will just have to try one of these tasty flautas yourself! It had some sour cream and pico de gallo on the plate as well. 

Fusion Tacos ($1.75 & $2.25 for flour tortilla) - I tried the pork and beef with one being on a corn tortilla and one on a flour tortilla. They weren't totally bad, but nothing spectacular to me. 

Beef Chow Fettuccine ($8.50) - This was the dish hubby wanted to try most. The cabbage and carrots were left out, but the portion was still hearty. The flavor of this dish was something new for me and I liked it. You can't go wrong on this dish with the price, portion and flavor. 

At the end of the meal fortune cookies and a fresh orange were brought to us. The orange was a light and tasty finish to our meal. I was very pleased with the service, taste and price here at KoMex Fusion!"}
{"text":"Another local gem. It may not look like much from the outside -- a small shop in a rundown old stripmall off of Decatur -- but inside you'll find some of the best fusion tacos and other great food at a modest price.

This place is all about the food. Both Korean-Mexican fusion tacos ($1.29 ea.) I tried were amazing. The pork and beef in each was a wonderful blend of sweet, sour, and spicy flavors. The tacos were generously topped with their respective protein, along with cabbage, tomatoes, and cilantro.

The pastor sope ($2.59) was a sizable portion of pork over beans and a light, crispy corn base and topped with lettuce and cotija cheese. The pork was excellent, without being too spicy.

The hand-made pork wontons ($1) came four to an order. All were crispy and delicious -- as good as any fried wontons around.

The bulgogi fusion burrito ($4.99) is big and delicious. It's stuffed with the same delicious beef as the tacos, along with Mexican rice, onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, and lettuce. There's no doubt this is the best burrito I've had.

The weakest dish I've had was the orange chicken ($3.49 for a half order). While the quality of the chicken was great, it lacked the punch in flavor that the other food had.

On my first visit I was given chips and fresh guacamole after ordering. On my second visit no chips -- they were busy so maybe they just forgot. And to finish the meal they deliver orange slices and fortune cookies. Everything may seem like an odd combination, but it all works because it's all delicious."}
{"text":"*** Credit card/debit card payment less than $10 will be charged extra $0.50 ***

You could say KoMex Fusion is similar to Kogi BBQ Truck in Los Angeles (founded by Roy Choi), but KoMex Fusion offers more than just Korean fusion tacos & burritos. You'll also find kimchi fried rice, musubi, wonton soup, enchitada, traditional Mexican burritos & tacos, etc.

The restaurant is hidden in a strip mall (approximately 15~20 minutes drive from the Strip) & there's another KoMex Fusion location (intersection of Buffalo & Flamingo), but I intentionally drove here because I wanted to visit the original location.

***

Complimentary chips: Good guacamole with some diced tomato. Salsa tasted slightly spicy and chips were freshly made (crunchy with a soft texture). 

Calamari Taco (flour tortilla with lettuce, pico de gallo, fusion tartar sauces - $3): Pretty good calamari and solid tortilla chip. Salsa was decent, but it could be better. You probably need tot add your own hot sauce to improve the overall flavors.

Beef Kimchi Fried Rice (fried egg on top, 1/2 serving for $8): Good seasoning and I like this dish.

Pork Belly Musubi (marinated rice wrapped in nori aka dried seaweed, 2 pieces for $6): Average pork belly + rice + seaweed = wait did I really pay $6 for this order?

***

Good cheap eat in Vegas (in fact my dinner on that night was my leftover from KoMex) and my recommendation is to get kimchi fried rice (good portion) & avoid any musubi (not worth what you are paying for).

P.S. - You'll get a fortune cookie at the end of your meal!

P.P.S. - 5% off the bill if you pay with cash!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I was pretty disappointed with this place. Food was either overpowering or too bland. I had pork belly tacos and some type of garbage style fries. Owners - visit Tijuana and study their tacos. Then come back up to LA and visit KTown to get back in touch. No offense, I love the concept you guys rock. A + for effort. But what do I know, I'm just a Korean/Mexican from San Diego who knows nothing about Korean food or Mexican food. Vegas locals know what's good for you!"}
{"text":"How good can a place be that serves both Korean and Mexican??!    FANTASTIC!  Sat right down, got served chips and salsa....the orders were up quick, portions are huge and everyone had a smile on their faces for around $30 for three adults. I hope to go back this weekend!"}
{"text":"Such great food! Really good mix of both styles. I ordered the Fusion Chimichanga. It was so large I didn't know where to start :-) . My boyfriend ordered their calamari taco, some wontons and shrimp ceviche. He loved all if it! The Calamari as really good. Would be awesome if they had it just as an appetizer on its own as well. Wonton soup was good too!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat Korean/Mexican food. The price is very affordable and decent. Great service and food tastes mighty fine. Ordered a bulgogi burrito and some bulgogi fries and has great taste. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Craving Mexican food at the time but then changed my mind driving to the taqueria. Decided to go to my favorite Chinese restaurant (Oasis A.K. ) because they cook cashew chicken and lo mein the way I like it. Needed drinks for dinner went to the Walgreens on Buffalo and Flamingo. Needed to make a U-turn to get to the Chinese place so I drive through the little strip mall and seen KoMex Fusion. Wonder what it was all about and Yelped it. Seen good reviews on it and decided to give it a try. Now I don't know about Devine intervention but this is it. First I was craving Mexican but then decided on Chinese. I know it wasn't Korean food but something led me to this place. First time here so looked over the menu. I \"Fused\" what I like at Oasis A.K. chicken and lo mein. Ordered the Chow Fettuccine w/chicken. Thank you for whom ever guided me to this place. I will be coming to this place a 2nd time to try another item. Most likely the bulgogi tacos or nachos or maybe the rice bowl. Everything looks good. Except the Spam items. Don't do Spam not even when it's with email. Huge portions also! Well worth the$$$ though on yelp it's only one $. Which means good food at a cheap price."}
{"text":"Oh....my god. I'm usually super skeptical about \"fusion\" foods because they often seem to be a shortcut for claiming creativity and innovation in cuisine. But. KoMex is the real deal -- freaking fabulous Korean-and-Mexican-influenced food that is executed absolutely perfectly. The dishes themselves seem sooo standard (omg fried rice and nachos, how quaint) but that is seriously misleading. They will be the most amazing fried rice and nachos that will ever grace your unworthy tastebuds and there will be enough portioned on your plate to serve a medium-to-large family (pace yourself).

The location is vaguely sketch and sort of random, to the point that I drove by it three times searching for a likely storefront -- don't make this mistake, it *is* in that plaza that looks straight out of the Walking Dead."}
{"text":"Gosh, after hearing and reading so many great reviews about Komex, we decided to stop by for lunch after 90 mins of pilates/yoga. It was quite a distance(22+ mins) and in the hood, but was worthed. We were quite excited to see on the item of the week board \"4 tacos for $5, fusion/Mexican\".  This is a great deal to sample different tacos. 

My friend, Patty, and I each got the
- bulgogi: this taco reigned supreme by Patty and I.  Unique and delish. We put the Chinese hot sauce/salsa on this baby and got ourselves a flavorful and tantalizing heaping of greatness. 
-asada: top this off with the Mexican salsa...good, but My taste bud could not forget the bulgogi
- carnita: oh how the pork was kinda crispy...I forgot about the bulgogi taco for a nano-second
-pollo:  I was full when I came to this taco. So I tried a piece of the chicken. Can't stack this up against the aforementioned three. Earl finished this taco for me.

We also tried the spam musubi. Portion was big. Was alright. 

I had a taste of the bulgogi burrito and it was very yummy with the Kim chi in it. Like what every other yelpers have mentioned, the burrito is gianormous.  It has value written all over it. 

Additionally, the Kim chi was super delicious. 

There isn't much decor and the seats were not the most comfy seats, but after eating the food, I forgot about it. 

We really wanted to try the pork taco on the fusion but they ran out of it. Boo. I was really excited to try that one too. Has to be for next time then."}
{"text":"My grading for restaurants is mainly based on food flavors & quality, not so much for service, ambiance, etc.
This is my 2nd time here.  They accommodated a large group on a really busy day with short notice.  5 stars for that.  Food that I ordered has been so-so.  I got the tacos with lettuce wraps - 2 pork, 1 chix.  Chix had no flavor, pork was good (not too greasy), but not excellent.  Others in our group ordered fried rice & thought it was really good.  I thought the fried rice portion was small.  Ingredients appeared fresh enough.
For a busy day, I would say their service was almost excellent.  Yes, the food took some time, but they kept the tortilla chips & salsa bowls full.  Consistently checked on us inc drinks.
Korean-Mexican food is no longer a new novelty.  Their flavors must either be excellent or menu must have something entirely different and interesting -- and flavorful.  I found neither."}
{"text":"It wasn't terrible, just not what I expected for all the hype....

Tried the nachos, enchiladas, fusion tacos and fusion burrito-it was just a-ok! Prices are indeed very reasonable. I will have to go back sometimes and try something else. Just didn't find anything to brag about."}
{"text":"I give this place a good 5 stars!!! First the place wasn't busy at all when we went, and this was our first time there so we were a little skeptical. But then we were reassured by the good service we received. The lady was kind of quiet and not super enthusiastic but she was playful and very attentive. 
Now... the FOOD! we got the Bulgogi burrito and Bulgogi Beef Nachos. The burrito was alright, good flavor and what not. But the NACHOS were insanely delicious :) It was like the perfect combination of flavors! 
I can definitely say this visit was a success and I am beyond satisfied with the service and the food. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"So good!  Mexican and Korean. Put your hands together!  It's the best of both. 
Surprisingly the wonton soup was good too. Had the pork belly tacos. So good.  Also had kimchi fried rice. Delish. I liked the chicken wings but sauce too thick. Will return."}
{"text":"Just left this spot and honestly could not be happier with my quick dinner.

I had the veggie teriyaki with tofu, and my family had the Mexican fusion dishes.

Everything was cooked fresh, and presented perfectly, and ridiculously quick.

The yelp hype is real, go check this spot out.
I wish I had a spot like this in my neighborhood"}
{"text":"First time here, service was good and fast, food was excellent.  Tacos were big and my bulgogi was perfect, No kids menu, but when we ordered they offered kid size for us.  Great place and we will be back"}
{"text":"We came here yesterday for lunch. Actually we wanted to go the restaurant next door but it was closed on Sundays so we decided to try this place. You get homemade fresh nachos with salsa and guac with the meal. We had their specials on the menu. It was Bulgogi Tater Tots consisting of tater tots, bulgogi, sour cream, bacon bits, tomatoes and green onions. It was crunchy and appetizing.

We also has Bulgogi skewers which was my favorite, very tender and satisfying. Pork belly skewers was ok. 

Interior was very casual. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. It's a great place to eat and doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"I love both Mexican food and Korean food.  Nothing can really go wrong here.  I love the menu, the food, the price and the service at KoMex.  I wish it's closer to home and work but beggers can't be choosers.  I told my boss about it, and it's one of her favorite places for lunch now.

Favorites:  Pork Tacos, Beef Tacos, free chip & salsa starter, prokkimchi fried rice
Friends' favorites:  Pork Tostada, Fulgogi Fries
Taste great but look like a heard attack:  Chimichanga"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out and I was finally able to! I got the bulgogi burrito and my friend got the bulgogi fries. They both were extremely delicious! I thought that the bulgogi burrito was actually sweeter than I preferred but it was still very good. I couldn't finish it all to myself so I was able to eat the other half the next day. I wasn't expecting it to be a sit down restaurant either. But the service was great. They greeted us upon arrival and out server Karina was awesome! She was so nice and was checking up on us regularly for more water, napkins, etc. I will definitely come back to try some other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Sometimes in life, God drops a blessing and just so happens Komex is one of them. I enjoy everything about this place! The food here is amazing. I enjoyed the beef tacos as well as the Kim chee fried rice. This place does not disappoint and every time I come to Vegas, I make sure I stop here and get some food.  The service was friendly and fast. Overall a must go if you are in town!!"}
{"text":"Yum!  This place is amazing!  Great price point and delicious food!  They've mastered bulgogi and their kimchi is amazing!  Great fusion food!  There is something for everyone here!"}
{"text":"KoMex is a solid restaurant if your looking for a quick meal. They are located in the same parking lot as Baby Stacks on the corner of Flamingo and Buffalo. The service is pretty good and so is the food...but don't expect to be blown away. Ive been here three times, and each time has been the same...average."}
{"text":"I crave this place when I'm in Vegas! Favorites: Fusion taco, fish taco, shrimp taco & their fried rice combo hits the spot. Home-cooked, savory goodness and my kind of comfort food starting at $1.29...you can't go wrong.  You guys wanna grub...then bring it on at Komex!  Bulgogi (Beef), Dak-gogi (Chicken), Daeji gogi (Pork) it's all good my friend!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Korean and decided on Komex solely based upon its wonderful Yelp reviews. And let me tell you, it was just as good as its awesome Yelp reviews. Nice & accurate work Yelpers!

I had the seasoned french fries (only $1!) and shrimp quesadillas which were loaded with shrimp. We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"I came here very exited to try the food after work.  I walked in and I was pointed to a table to sit at my w young nice guy.  I sat where I thought I was asked to sit.  Once I sat down I was rudely moved to another table by an older guy.  The guy said \"the guy asked you to sit at that other table\", but said it with such a quick and nasty attitude.  I said sorry and moved to the other table.  At that point I really felt embarrassed and upset and felt like leaving.  I decided to stay anyways and try the food.  I ordered the bulgogi fries.  They were not what I expected.  The fries were soo soggy and the meat mushy.  I got the 1/2 order and I'm glad I did not order the full size because after eating 1/4 of this I started to feel nauseous.  I had ordered an order of the bulgogi rice to go.  My husband tried this and didn't like it.  He said it left a weird after taste and feeling in his tongue.  I hadn't even told him about the fries.  I will never go here again.  I don't know what everyone goes so crazy about and why the reviews are soo high for this place.  Nasty nasty and terrible service!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came to this place,cause all of the great reviews this place has snd I  must say they did not disappoint im not sure if the guy at the register is the owner or not but he was extremely nice and instantly made me comfortable being this was my first time here,and thst was just the beginning the fusion burrito was very tasty and the pork taco was amazing,I will most def be back.."}
{"text":"So I live in Orange County, where Kogi is a household name now. You know, the whole Korean-Mexican craze that took over all of LA/OC a few years back... my wife and I tried the food once and found it to be oily/greasy, salty, and just overpowering in general. It just didn't strike the right chord with us. We took a break from Korean-Mexican after making it ourselves at some point after that (and being a lot more satisfied). After perusing Yelp to satisfy/compromise between our friends' desires for tacos and my wife's cravings for Korean, we settled on KoMex, which was just around the corner from where we were staying. We phoned our orders in and picked the food up before the concert-folks headed out to see Mariah. 

Wow, was this the right decision. The food was awesome. Not overly greasy (for the bulgogi nachos and fries), well-seasoned, and just perfectly balanced. Here's the sheet of stuff we ordered, roughly:

- kimchi fried rice (beef)
- fusion tacos (bulgogi, spicy pork and pork belly)
- bulgogi bowl
- bulgogi fusion burrito
- 1/2 order bulgogi fries
- 1/2 order bulgogi nachos

So two of the people eating are Korean, and my wife grew up eating Korean food. So all were on them for feedback. I'm pretty sure it was a hit, because everything with the exception of the huge kimchi fried rice order, was gone by the end (this was shared between 6 between). Everybody loved their food, and the only reason the kimchi fried rice was left over was because everyone was so stuffed. Don't worry, a couple of us finished off the kimchi fried rice the next morning (really good stuff and they don't mess with trying to make this one fusion, which is a good call - just keep it simple). The bulgogi was probably the star of the night, as it found its way into most of our stuff :) I really liked the pork belly taco though - it's not the soft pork belly but more like the well-cooked/almost-crispy style pork belly that you'd cook up at KBBQ (samgyeupsal). Man, I should have ordered several of those instead. The bulgogi fries were great though slightly oily/soggy at the bottom and not crispy, for some reason... it didn't matter and these tasted delicious. Furthermore, these, along with the nachos were completely obliterated. 

So if you're craving something different and have heard of Korean-Mexican fusion or tried it before, I'd highly recommend this place. Pricing is reasonable and the food is really good. Oh, make sure to get the hot sauce on side :)"}
{"text":"Not a super fan. Good food. Many of my friends are nuts about the place though. I would go back, but not every week like some friends."}
{"text":"Good flavors, cheap prices, huge portions. What else do you need?

There's really not a lot to criticize at the prices are their food is offered at. When you pay 7 dollars for an entree, you generally don't expect that your food is going to be particularly special. However, they've got the fusion thing down here.

Korean food and Mexican foods go surprisingly well together - though it is hardly a secret anymore. My buddy and I tried out three dishes.

1. Bulgogi Burrito with kimchee
2. Bulgogi Nachos
3. Enchilada Plate with spicy pork

We were poorly prepared for the portion sizes. We could easily have taken 2/3 of every plate home, but we stuffed our faces full of the delicious food. The nachos in particularly are strikingly large in volume, and would require a number of people to down it as an appetizer. A half order would have been better... but hey, it's only $2 more for a full sized leftover!"}
{"text":"I broke my Komex cherry yesterday. Went for a late lunch yesterday so I kept it small. We split some Bulgogi nachos which were Fan Tastic! I had the fusion sliders(with Bulgogi). Two nice sized sliders loaded with meat. Bulgogi is well seasoned and so flavorful! I need a return trip to try the spicy pork."}
{"text":"Very small place and gets crowded during lunch rush hour, but my review isn't about that...

There were so many choices I didn't know what to get! I tried a little of everything so I ordered:

Bulgogi burrito
Bulgogi fries
Bulgogi Kim Chee taco. 

The burrito was tasty and bulgogi was tender. I love that it had Kim Chee (you have to ask for it) which gave it an extra tang. I wasn't too fond of the rice, as it was lacking in flavor and a bit mushy. 
The fries looked delicious at first, but was hard to eat as the cheese quickly cools making it hard to have a perfect bite. I thought it was just ok, and would easily skip on my next visit. 
The taco was pretty tasty, the only con is that there's too much liquid from the Kim Chee that it makes the tortilla soggy and breaks it. It was pretty messy. 

All in all, the items were good, but I'd just stick to the burrito. I'm eager to try more items off their menu since I enjoy the Korean Mexican fusion concept."}
{"text":"We paid a visit to the KoMex family again, and this time, Sonny had a Bulgogi Torta special that sounded too good to pass up. The wifey was a little sicky, so she ordered half orders of the Asian style Siete Mares soup, and Mongolian Beef(yup, they do half orders on the Asian menu items cause the portions are HUMANGOUS!!! As always, the food was delish! I also had to sample the Spam Musubi with egg which looked like a Flintstone's portion where the nori could barely hold everything together, spam was perfect, the rice was kissed with a little shoyu and sesame love, and another KoMex item worth attacking....Mahalo once again Lynda, Brittany, and Chef/Sherriff Sonny!(yup, the KoMex mascot is Sonny;)......Also, as Misti Y. requested, they're also perfecting a tofu fusion taco, and for those of you living in the Southwest area, keep your fingers crossed...expansion plans are in the works by year's end where they plan to serve just the fusion stuff...ALOHA!!!            

                      YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(5/365) Better than Kogi!?!?!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food displays passion, finesse, and real ingenuity.  The Korean Mexican fusion works. It is good and honest food that does not try to be what it is not.  It is not froufrou fancy.  If you come for that (as some have), then sure, you will be disappointed.  It ain't Nobu.  But it's better in some ways.  It is garden variety comfort food with an exotic twist.  The service is friendly and attentive, although a bit slow. No worries. Take time and do not rush. The atmosphere is totally disjointed and crazy. A lone and unattended (really, abandoned bar) sits off by its lonesome...making no sense whatsoever. There is a framed child's Korean dress (han bok?) and a child's Mexican dress on the wall. Like something a crazy aunt who never married might have. Never you mind! This place is worth a trip, and you might find it a keeper."}
{"text":"KoMex Express is a real, authentic family owned Korean resturaunt. I have been in Las Vegas for 13 months, and this is the most authentic and closest Korean food I have had to eat since when I was stationed there in Korea from 2006-2007. All the food is affordable and beyond good. There is nothing on the menu that anyone can call expensive and if you do your nuts. My favorites are the shrimp tacos and a Bulgogi burrito, so good. The only thing missing from Korea is a soju bowl and the late night runs to town for chicken on stick and hand made chesse sticks."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp! Thanks for all the previous reviews! 

We were greeted by friendly staff and we're seated. We had just enough time to study the menu. Then a smiling waitress took our order. After the order, we were served complimentary chips with salsa and guacamole. The chips were very fresh yet not greasy. The Bulgogi Taco was amazing! I wish this restaurant was near my house... The Bulgogi Burrito was good, but after tasting the Taco, it just didn't message up. Don't get me wrong! It's really good... Just not as good as the Bulgogi Taco. The Kimchi fried rice was good too. But, I'll stick with the BULGOGI TACOS from now! 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was more like a 3.5 star but the service puts it at 4 stars!

We came one evening on a weekday so it really wasn't busy at all.  It's a fast food place in a little strip mall.  Since we were 2 families, we had 4 rugrats with us and I really appreciated how the lady took her time to make sure we didn't over order for the kids and was so accommodating in varying the dishes a little to accommodate our picky eaters.

As for us adults, I have to say I was very excited reading the menu and wanted to order everything.  But I was informed they have generous portions so I will have to come back to taste more.  =)

Overall, the food is freshly cooked fast food style --- if you want this type of food and like Korean food, then you will be quite satisfied."}
{"text":"Kind of a throw back joint.  Food was pretty good.  Some of the things that go to me were a few soggy tortilla chips and the beef taste over marinated,a little to salty.  But over all the service was great.  Again, it is what it, simply great.  So when you approach the door of this local \"hole in the wall\" joint leave your pretenious thoughts ouside and prepair yourself for great food truck style food, in a sit down restaurant. Mmmm, mm..."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was not as impressed as I expected to be, but I was not let down either. I liked everything we ordered, which was the fusion chicken fried rice, fusion tacos (chicken and pork) and a fusion beef burrito. The tacos were my fav, the pork especially. The tea was perfect, hot jasmine tea, yum.  Our waitress was very nice, the wait wasn't too bad (felt worse cuz we were starving).  I wouldn't get fried rice again, maybe not the burrito, but tacos yes."}
{"text":"Tacos were excellent! Sojuritas would have been amazing if they were fresh made instead of with bottled sugary soda. 

Owner is super sweet and very helpful."}
{"text":"I get the fusion fries with the spicy chicken (not listed as an option but they say yes if I ask). My absolute favorite with their house-made hot sauce. The second I smell it whenever I pick up my food, I literally cannot stop salivating on the way home. Thankfully I'm only 1 1/2 minutes down the street."}
{"text":"Apparently the owner listened to guys like H.K.L. and decided she needed to raise her prices. Maybe I was just spoiled on her really low prices but now her prices are about average and it takes the wow factor out of it for me. I loved the fact that I could come and order a couple of entrees for 10 bucks. Now that time has passed. The real turn off was finding a hair in my chips. I took them back up to the owner and she apologized and offered to bring me another basket. At that point I just paid the bill and left. I really loved Komex as you can tell from my previous reviews. At this point I just feel like the success has turned to greed and I won't be back."}
{"text":"came here to have lunch with my husband.  Granted there is a sign near the cash register that says it's NOT A FAST FOOD place BUT, there was no sign that said ... your wontons, and my husband ordered a plate, it had rice, kim chee, some meat and an egg ... it took them 45 minutes to bring my won tons.  10 minutes later, they brought the rest of the food out and we just had them pack it up."}
{"text":"Delicious food, just amazing flavor!! Completely worth the short drive from downtown. This place is perfect for vegetarians. So many fun menu items to choose from. Also, great service as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Soild 4, for all my ballers on a budget the food at this family run joint comes out quick, hot and yummy to boot! I try to make a visit when I'm nearby. I usually get the burrito with some form of Korean meat! Comes with a side of chips & dip! Nom motherf*uking nom."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Korean-Mexican fusion. Ordered me some taquitos, but instead of guac they added some creamy sauce over the top with a powdered cheese. It was delicious. For my meal I got the Dak-gogi(chicken) burrito. The portion was huge. Too much for me in one sitting. 
The place is family-owned. The staff was very friendly, so much so that their customers greeted me as I walked in. My first time there, but I already felt like a regular. I was so hungry, and I wanted to eat fast. The problem is that anything Mexican only takes 5 min to make. So if you wanted to eat any of the Asian side of the menu, the wait is 20min for your order. My plan for a return visit is to simply order ahead."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the fusion tacos.  The place was empty when we arrived for lunch but quickly became packed and there was a line of people waiting for a table out the door.  It's nothing fancy on the inside but the food was delicious.  Planning on going back to try some different menu items.  Just remember they aren't open on Mondays!"}
{"text":"This place is putting out some pretty tasty food.  It is located in a small outdoor strip mall and you might miss it as it is tucked away in the corner.  I have been here several times and each time the food is very good.  I usually order one of the fusion items, which is a nice mix of Korean and Mexican.  I have had the bulgogi  and spicy pork tacos which are loaded with meat and other ingredients; these are delicious.  I have also had the spicy pork fusion torta, which was huge and very tasty.  This was a great mixture of flavors.  The fusion (bulgogi) chimichanga was also great.  The dishes are very flavorful and loaded with ingredients.  All of the dishes I have tried thus far have a great mixture of texture, spice and complexity of flavor.  This is deffinitely one of my go to places when in that part of Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning right before hitting the popular Vegas day beach clubs. We were greeted by a very friendly man who explained the whole menu for us and the different options we had when ordering. I don't recall his name but he was very attentive of us and made sure we enjoyed the Ko-Mex experience.

We had the kimchi fried rice with tofu, bulgogi fries, fish tacos, and the winner of our meal: tater tots with bulgogi! Ala carte, the kimchi fried rice and fish tacos were good. Not great, but good. They have two house sauces - one of which, the sweeter one - brought everything together when added to the meals, bringing my aforementioned \"good\" up to a wonderful! I didn't get to try the other house sauce, which they explained was spicier than the one we had, but again I can't make it past a level 4 on the spiciness scale. The tater tots were just amazing, both with and without the house sauce.

Tip: 5% off if you pay with cash!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Beef bulgogi fried rice is great. Large portion and may even be enough for two people. Staff is friendly. Bring cash to get discount."}
{"text":"Dare I say that they are better than the Korean/Mexican fusion that is LA's infamous Kogi. YES, YES...I DARE!

The lack of help staff can kinda be overlooked by the fact that the food was YUM-O!!!
It's a small hole in the wall spot my friend always goes to so, he wanted to bring me there.
When we got there, we waited a few minutes for someone to finish their food so we could cop their table.

We got the bulgogi fried rice, fish tacos, and bulgogi tacos. All were pretty amazing especially since I'm comparing them to Kogi.
Their complimentary salsa and chips were good, too. All tasted homemade. They had all kinds of chili sauces from Chinese chili oil combo to Saracha to a Mexican brand I've never had before.

I was giggling that they had musubi on their menu.

The one major factor to this spot is that they are soooooooo far!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Love how they mix things up and really friendly owner. A+ restaurant. Always eat here at least 3x a week on my lunch break. Great serving of food. Will recommend to everyone..."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ tacos?!?! Yes yes and yes. Delicious! Although at night sometimes the meat is a little dry. I love their kimchi fried rice too,"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome! This is like Korean soul food... you still get a good, hearty meal with plenty of flavor and at a good price! Service is nice and with a smile and oh my god... the bulgogi tater tots were the best thing I've ever had. Will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"This is a great place if you enjoy mexican and/or korean food and also if you appreciate a fusion of both. Ive been to this location many times and have had all good experiences so far. The service has also been courteous and polite and every dish we try has been delicious!!! We've tried most of the menu and its all been tasty! But my favorites have been their bulgogi nachos and also the bulgogi quesadillas.... wow amazing!! You have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"We had this recommended to us by a friend and I thought the mixture of the 2 was really weird. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they have some really great food. I've been here 2 times now and out of everything that Ive had so far, the nachos are my favorite. If they had these nachos at a random movie theater that theater would own all. The kalbi  sticks are a great quick snack. Service is fast and the lady we had explained things very well especially at explaining how hot some of the meals are.

For the type of place this is I can't really imagine it any better."}
{"text":"I've read so much about this place and finally decided to go after work today, and wow I was impressed!

Other reviewers talked about how there's a wait, but when I got there at around 2:30 (prime lunch hour) there were only two other parties there! I was seated promptly, given my beverage, a menu and complimentary tortilla chips, guacamole and pico de gallo. 

I ordered the Bulgogi Nachos and wow, if I had known the servings were so huge I would've just had a half order! The prep for my food didn't take very long, maybe 10mins tops and it was delicious. The bulgogi in the nachos were generous and were strayed all over the top along with some pico de gallo and jalapeños. The bulgogi itself was marinated to a balanced sweet and saltiness that it almost made me want to order something else that had more of it. 

The waitresses constantly refilled my water and were very nice. The price for my entire meal was very generous and the service was all together very pleasant. 

Next time I will definitely be trying the other fusions on the menu (mmm pork belly tacos). 

If you haven't had the chance to try fusion food made right I'd definitely recommend you pay a visit to this place! Just be sure to call ahead of time to reserve tables if you have a fairly large party, the place itself is very small and I could imagine it getting filled very quickly."}
{"text":"The food was ok. The Korean element is very heavy in the flavor of te tacos. I ordered one calamari and two pork belly tacos. The food  has a hint of sweetness that is very different from any other Mexican joint in town. The specialty food is defiantly  one of a kind, however, being one of a kind is not always a compliment, and in the case of Komex it does not really add any level of satisfaction to the original.

The only reason I am writing this review is because the service I received was stupid. I ordered three tacos to go and was told that it would be a fifteen minute wait, no biggie, I took a walk for the fifteen minutes and then returned to the restaurant.  [this is what mad me decide to no longer go to this establishment] I walk in and am greeted by the same person that took my order no more than fifteen minutes ago, he asks me if I will be having my food to go or dining in, I do not understand how someone can forget a customer so quick, as if I never even came in. I t was not until I told him that I was just in there to pick up my order that I just placed, that her remembered who I was. Well he then proceeded to piss me the hell off, he gave my tacos away to some other customer. He must smoke an otherworldly amount of pot because  he forgot me on a slow night at that. He then apologized and said that my tacos will be remade. My tacos were done in approximately 7-8 minutes. 

In conclusion, I will never go to Komex again, not just because the service is shit, but because the food is overpriced and is not very good.

sorry komex dude, I just had to tell it like it is.

PS:the name reminds me of tampon box"}
{"text":"Bulgogi tacos were so delicious.  The kimchi fried rice was delicious too.  The service was good.  My children and I enjoyed our visit to KoMex.  We will visit on our next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  Decor in different parts of the restaurant don't really work well together (ie: bamboo wallpaper vs. Korean-Mexican cartoons). 

LIKE  Larger space than the other location which means little to no wait at all. Location is closer to home. The complimentary chips with guacamole and salsa.

LOVE  The fusion concept. The amount of food for the price. The kimchi fried rice. The musubi with fried egg. The knowledgeable and energetic server. The different options for almost each entree."}
{"text":"Customer service is good. Food is good. I wish they would post picture's of there food it just would make it more helpful."}
{"text":"I used to go north komex location.
I was really big fan of this place.

Their bulgogi fushion burrito and kimchi fried rice are my favoriate !!"}
{"text":"Went here based on it's high score on Yelp.
Pulling into the parking lot I was wondering if we had made the right decision. Let me tell you this place is a diamond in the rough. My wife had the bugogi (sp?) Plate with pork and I had the fusion pork tamales. We also split an order of spam musubi. 
Everything was excellent. The wait staff was very good as well. We've put this on our \"every time we go to Vegas, we gotta go here\" list."}
{"text":"I ate here a while ago and it was the first thing my friend and I ate after a day in Red Rock and as soon as it hit our stomachs we knew we were in for some horrible food poisoning. I kid you not, I went to the bathroom to throw up in the middle of the meal because my stomach hurt so bad. I have never gone back and as much as I love the idea and concept of this place, I do not want to have to worry about shitting my pants everytime I eat a bulgogi burrito."}
{"text":"What can I say about a place that provides intensely flavorful treats at an affordable price; FINALLY! 
When you enter the door the restaurant is plain, nothing over the top, just comfortable and intimate. We were seated and brought drinks and free chips and salsa with homemade guacamole. Who does that? How awesome! We then were told about the $5 special that was 3 bulgogi tacos and a drink. It's less than eating McDonalds, but quality food. I cannot say enough nice things about what we ate or the service. For the first time in my life after eating we ordered 2 more specials and a plate of fried rice to go to eat for dinner. Such an awesome experience."}
{"text":"We are regulars of Komex
I have tried several things on the menu and enjoyed them all
My personal favorite is kimchi fried rice with pork for the meat it is delicious and spicy (love kimchi and spicy food)
Spam masubi with or without egg and it a nice big severing and you get 2
Plenty of different drinks to choose from usually just get water, if it's cold out then hot white/green tea which they serve in a nice pot 
Highly recommend trying Komex"}
{"text":"Found the new location in my hood and couldn't be happier about it. Empty for dinner last Friday night but not for much longer. The new space is large and has a bar, with beer and wine coming soon according to the owner. These are super nice and hard working people that will make this place wildly successful in these parts I'm guessing. Delicious bulgogi flautas and a cheeseteak I'm still thinking about if you're wondering what we had. Same great food, and now unlimited potential in this new spot. I see big things for this place here and probably 10 more pounds around my gut. This city's affordable food options get better every day."}
{"text":"I had heard and read about this place for months before finally stopping in for a quick dinner with friends last night. The hype is strong and that kind of anticipation can often lead to dissapointment. Not this meal.
 We arrived seperately so two of us were seated and I quickly chose to try a both a bugogi beef and spicy pork fusion taco as an appetizer and get an idea of what I REALLY wanted to order. Both tacos were fantastic...Everything a great taco should be- fresh, doubled up tortillas, a generous pertion of meat and garnished wonderfully with some fresh pico, cilantro a few strands of cris cabbage and limes. Also there was a slight tang of vinegar like acidity at the end I loved. 
 When I saw the Fusion Fries on the menu my eyes burned laser holes thru that section of the menu, only question was which of these well prepared meats would I choose. Being a risk taker by nature I inquired about the possibility of both meats but was denied by a level headed chef who probably knew better. I went with the beef and was not dissapointed. My only reservation with this dish was the fact that the shoestring fries were no match for the mountain of goodness blanketed lovingly over them. Might go with the nachos next time which my friends ordered and were anchored by the same sturdy homeade tortilla chips that were presented to us free of charge on arrival. Delicious.
 Service was very good, especially considering we had people staggering into our table at different times and seperate checks. Extremely humble spot, but clean and comfortable.
 I was on the fence between 4 and 5 stars but the prices are ridiculously low and the fact that they're bringing something different that is also family run AND homeade to a part of town that needs it? Home run."}
{"text":"Read the other reviews, believe what you read here and just go, you will not regret it. Very friendly, good food and inexpensive. We need to support these kinds of great businesses that are such value and will be missed if they don't stick around. Go, eat, enjoy, come back again ya hear!"}
{"text":"Combination chow fettuccini is so good and the bulgogi tarot totz are the appetizer of choice feeling for something spicey and I mean spicey go for the kimchi fried rice combination with bulgogi shrimp and I switch out chicken for spam so good"}
{"text":"My first time eating here at Komex... but it was the best food I've had from such a small place.  I got the Mongolian Beef and it was awesome.  I expected it to be spicier."}
{"text":"Love this place! My aunt and uncle introduced my family and I to this spot while vacationing in Vegas a while back and this by far is one of the best restaurants ever! The customer service is great, the food is fantastic, and the price isn't bad either! I recommend it to anyone looking to try something new or just simply experience fusion dining."}
{"text":"While driving to the SoBe Ice Arena in the northern part of Las Vegas, my travel companion eyed KoMex. Intrigued by the name, and the concept of a fusion of Korean and Mexican cuisine, we stopped by for a quick noshing after completing our event at the rink. 

There's not much going on in terms of decor or ambience in this little eatery, but those types of trivialities should be shelved; it's the food that is king at this local hotspot. KoMex has all the appearances of a neighborhood taco shop, but it really is a full service, sit-down restaurant.  Upon entry, it was refreshing to see a sign that loosely read, \"This is not fast food. Expect to wait a little longer for your meal.\"  And that was just fine with us.

We decided to share an order of the Bulgogi Nachos. In addition, I ordered one of their shrimp tacos, while my lunching companion selected the Spicy Pork Tostada. The nachos were delicious. The distinct flavor of the bulgogi integrated nicely with the classic Mexican nacho construction. I was quite impressed. My taco was also pretty darn good, packed full of shrimp (they don't skimp, thankfully) and flavored by a delicious white sauce. Needless to say, the somewhat grumpy disposition I had developed before walking into KoMex quickly subsided after the first few bites. 

Final bill was around $17. A great bargain for the ton of food that we received.

Amazing concept. Flawless execution. 
If I were a local, I fear KoMex would become one of my regular haunts."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful. My friends and I ordered the tacos and lettuce wraps. I couldn't complain about the food at all.

The reason for the four stars is because the service was so slow. We had to wait about 20 minutes just to order our food after we were seated."}
{"text":"Holy cow!! This place is insanely good!! Bulgogi fries and bulgogi tostada are to die for!! The tostada has a crispy rice cake in place of a crispy tortilla. Insanely delicious! I have nothing but great things to say about this place. I can't vouch for the \"non-fusion\" items but the fusion items are awesome! Reasonably priced and excellent attentive service makes this an even better dining experience. If you haven't make the trek to try this place, stop what you're doing and go now!!"}
{"text":"I'll post my full review later. But this place is to die for.  It's been a long time and I still talk about this place. Gotta go back soon. KoMex Fusion I'm coming for you."}
{"text":"I have had one 5 star visit here and one 1 star visit, so the average is 3 stars.

First time was great!  Our waiter was a Bonanza High School student who was so charming and friendly.  He gave us some free guac because we told him it was our first time there.  I got the Fusion Burrito, which was surprisingly delicious, and my husband got the orange chicken.  The staff was really friendly and we talked with the owner about how she wants to open another location.

I had been itching to go back since then and we went last night.  Now, they had just opened up again after being on Christmas vacation, so I don't know if that is why it was so crazy in there,  but our second experience wasn't as good.  It was very crowded at 8:00 on a Wednesday night. My husband wanted the orange chicken again, but they had taken it off the menu.  He was really disappointed by that.  I ordered the carne de puerco. Unfortunately, the meat was cold and the rice and beans looked like they were from a can.  The owner was the only one waiting tables this time, so she was super frazzled.

I like this place and I like the lady who owns the restaurant, so I'll definitely be back, but my last visit definitely moved them down a few notches for me."}
{"text":"The Bugogi grilled cheese was my favorite but everything else I had was delicious too. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great hidden spot in Las Vegas!  I come from a Korean and Mexican background so this place was perfect for me.  The Bulgogi, marinated beef, burrito is a all time great and is an automatic go to dish for around $5 and can usually feed you for two meals.  Another recommended item is the Daegi bulgogi, spicy pork, french fries. 

 For those of you that have hit Robertos Tacos late night and enjoyed their super carne asada fries you will love these.  They step it up every week with new specials such as calamari tacos and bulgogi gyros so you never get bored with the menu.  The Korean street tacos blend the tastyness of Korean meats with the ease  of tacos, I recommend ordering a few at the low price of $1.29.  I could go on forever on the best items on the menu so head over and decide for yourself.

If you have friends that aren't too adventurous or little kids Komex can handle that too.  They offer sliders, french fries and other basics that are just as good.  Because this place is so good and really affordable it can get busy around peak times so don't get frustrated and recognize that if there are tons of people eating there then it must be good."}
{"text":"Little else can be said about KoMex other than get here as soon as you can. The flavors and the textures are a party in your mouth. 

Come really hungry because you're going to want to \"overdo it\" and order way more than is reasonable for a party of your size. 

You'd be wise to only look at the \"Fusion Specialties\" section of the menu. Our bellies were so happy:
- Bulgogi nachos - hot damn! These might be my 'last meal'
- The four hot sauces available on the table:  unique, not too spicy, flavor packed (you're going to want to put them in your bag/purse)
- Fusion wings - extra crispy, only slightly spicy and slightly sweet - perfect to share
- Fusion flautas - YUM, everyone seemed to be ordering these, so we did too
- Fusion enchiladas - also yum, although we couldn't tell which enchilada was which meat (we ordered the combo) 

If you're visiting Vegas and have a rental car, this place is 120% worth a visit. 

I'd dish out five Yelp Stars if it weren't for the woman who was our waitress - who aslo seemed to be the manager. She had a bit of an attitude that put us off and also constantly yelled at the other staff (in front of customers)."}
{"text":"Place is bangin! Fusion fries were fire, like life changing. Kimchi fried rice was good too"}
{"text":"I had the chicken bulgogi and it was very good.  The flavors were all new to me and very enjoyable.  The service was a little slow, but we did have a larger group and we were not in a hurry.  The prices were pretty cheap for the amount of food I got.  Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal.

I would definitely go back if I am in that area.

If you are looking for a very filling lunch you've come to the right place."}
{"text":"After reading the good reviews, my sister, kids & I decided to try this restaurant out. We were welcomed w/ a friendly greeting upon entering & seated right away. 

As everyone mentioned, the food was great & the portions were huge. The burritos were like whoa! Loved all the tacos. The chicken tacos were my favorite. Everything seemed so fresh from the chips to the salsa. I loved the flavors of all the sauces. My kids loved the chicken taquitos. 

One time, I ordered the kimchi fried rice w/ an egg & I had leftovers for days. It's freak'n huge! The service is excellent. They made sure our fresh chips fresh guac & fresh salsa was filled.

 I appreciated the fact that they sell the cold glass bottled soda beverages that use pure cane sugar instead of the corn syrup crap out there. 

It's also nice that they have different kinds of food options. American, Mexican, Asian or Fusion. It's great because my oldest son isn't too fond of the Asian flavors but he likes Mexican & American & my youngest loves the Asian flavors. So w/ their menu being so versatile, really helped make the our decisions easier for the whole family. 

The whole meal was an amazing value for us. Great food, great service & unbeatable prices. What more can u ask for? I can't wait to go back & get some more of those delicious chicken tacos. In fact, I can't wait until they have a location closer to my side of town in the southwest."}
{"text":"absolutely amazing.  bulgolgi nachos, tacos, and tostadas and all we ate was amazing.  ownership is super nice.  they have dialed this in."}
{"text":"Before I tried Komex - which my brother has been raving about for years - I thought I hated \"fusion.\"  Every fusion thing I had tried before was gross.  But, because it is my brother's favorite place, I went into it with an open mind.

There are vegetarian options (tofu, veggies, bean & cheese), but it seems like this place is more of a winner for the meat-eaters.

I had the cheese enchiladas (not fusion style) and the seasoned fries.  (The menu has fusion stuff, just Mexican stuff, Asian stuff, and American stuff.)  My plan was to make my own fusion - enchiladas and fries!  Who does that!  No one!  Fusion!  I got a side of kimchi as well, in case I felt like getting real nuts.  (My brother got a side of the stir fried kimchi ($2) and this is way better than the normal kimchi - go for it.)

The enchiladas by themselves were nothing special.  I think they had mozzarella cheese on them, which was weird.  There was just too much cheese in general.  Beans were good though.  I tried some bites with kimchi, and it was a winner.

The fries were great though.  I put some of the sauces they give you on the fries, along with some of my side of kimchi, and they were booooommmmb.  This should be something you can order - feel free to call it \"Leslie's Favorite.\" 

Because of this good experience, next time I'd be willing to try an actual fusion item - which is a big step because before Komex I had sworn off ever trying anything fusion again.

Service was great, but I didn't like all the people waiting for a table staring me down while I was trying to enjoy my meal - put those suckers behind a screen or something!"}
{"text":"I love Korean and Mexican food! Whoever thought of this was a genius! I found Komex on yelp and went on a Sunday evening. We went at around 6pm and it slowly got packed. We ordered the bulgogi (beef and chicken), fried rice, fish lettuce wrap, spam musubi and wonton soup. Everything was pretty tasty but my favorite was the fried rice. It was hot, fresh, flavorful, and had tons of beef, chicken and shrimp. Service was excellent and the portions are very big. We ordered 1/2 orders and still had leftovers. Prices are also reasonable for the amount of food you get. I love their food and will definitely be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I ate at the Decatur and Washington Location on 7-23-2014.  It is hidden in a small strip mall and parking is at a premium.  The business was small but clean.  I arrived just before the place became busy. I was hoping to have a great eating experience, as the reviews I read, indicated others had enjoyed the food and service.  I ordered the (1/2 Order) of Bulgogi fries which was about $6.00 and a Diet Pepsi (which was bottled and cost $2.00)  The bulgogi fries tasted old and luke warm.  The meat, cheese and jalapenos were tasty but were also dry and by the time I finished them, were  cold and stuck together.  I was disappointed as I had driven quite a ways to eat there and it really wasn't worth the drive.  I ordered a burrito to go ($7.00) and it had it latter that day at home and it was only average.  I do not have the great experience that other reviewers seemed to have, nor did I find the food to be the \"bomb\" as  others rated the food to be.   The people running the place were friendly and I was happy with the service, but I came for the food and I will have to think if I want to go and try this place again."}
{"text":"Having just moved to Las Vegas from The Bay Area, I wanted to try something new and delicious. Enter KoMex. Now, I am as Mexican as it gets. And being so close to San Francisco's Mission District and San Jose's East Side, I was blessed with some of the best Mexican food in the United States, so of course my palette tends to be a bit critical when it comes to Mexican dishes.

That said, this place was actually really good! We were seated promptly and during out stay we were approached twice and asked if everything was fine. Now that's pretty awesome customer service. 

My friend ordered the fusion flautas and I ordered the bulgogi burrito. I had a flauta and it was delicious. Very crunchy and flavorful. My burrito was pretty big and it was really good but I felt that it was missing sour cream. I mean, who the hell eats their burrito without \"crema mexicana\" or failing that, normal sour cream? Not a bad overall burrito but definitely not game changing and not amongst the best I've had. But again, my standards are ridiculously high.

They ended the service with orange slices and fortune cookies. Which was a nice touch. And over all the meal ended up being less than $20 for the two of us. Score!

I'll definitely be back. Maybe next time I'll get some of those flautas or try something else on their really yummy looking menu."}
{"text":"drove to the hood today (washington and decatur)  to try komex. upon arriving i thought it was a fast food joint but realizing it was actually a sit down place. my first thought was this place is classy. Food i ordered and tried was bulgogi, chicken and pork tacos. my favorite was the bulgogi my least favorite was the pork. the flavor of the tacos were good just wished the tortilla was a little bigger. I also tried the bulgogi french fries. the fries were ok...its just basically soggy fries, cheese and bulgogi. and then korean sauce poured all over it. i definitely wouldnt get them again. i dont think id drive to komex unless i was close to it. if i did the only thing id order again is the tacos."}
{"text":"TLDR: Great fusion-style food; limited healthful choices; no lunch specials; 5% off when paying via cash; complimentary chips and salsa with order

I think KoMex is one of those original restaurants that continued to thrive when the rest faded away. I waited to write my review after trying various items on the menu. 

Korean-inspired dishes are pretty tasty and are pretty greasy. Kimchi fried rice has an overpowering kimchi flavor, but the kimchi as an accompaniment is welcome in the other rice dishes. Opt for the bulgogi nachos or bulgogi rice bowl if you're looking for something tasty. I like the rice bowl because it comes with a vinegar-based cold slaw, mixed greens, warm rice, kimchi, and protein of choice all under a sunny-side up egg. The flavors and temperature variation mesh well to provide a well-balanced meal. 

While there are no lunch specials, the prices are average and won't break the bank, especially if you pay with cash to receive the discount. While this isn't my favorite location, I'm always happy to come here for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! I've never had tacos wrapped in lettuce and let me tell you it was the best I ever had. This was such a refreshing dish lite and absolutely delicious! The service was awesome I can tell the owner and his wife really care. I would definitely come back here whenever I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! I was kinda skeptical about this place, Korean & Mexican fusion?!?! But I gotta say it's really good. Waitress is very helpful too. You should try this place if you like Asian food or Mexican."}
{"text":"I'm always super skeptical of fusion foods, because they usually don't turn out that great... but KoMex is definitely an exception. The service is noticeably wonderful and I like that they have both tables and bar seating. 

The food portions are huge, especially for the price. I ordered the Bulgogi Rice Bowl ($8) which has bulgogi, rice, KoMex slaw, jalapenos, kimchi, lettuce, a fried sunny side up egg, and this spicy sauce. It was filling and the amount of spice was just right. Of course there is a rack of hot sauce for the more daring diners.

This happens to me a lot... but my friends usually order something better than what I have. Apparently for a limited time only, KoMex is serving Bulgogi Tater Tots ($9) which are tater tots topped with bulgogi, pork belly, bacon, sour cream, tomatoes, green onions, cheese. Best late night meal you can possibly ask for. Anyone who loves potatoes will be floored by the Bulgogi Tater Tots, so give them a try before they're off the menu!

There are so many great options on the menu, all of them with raving reviews on Yelp, so I can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is amazing! So far I have tried the Bulgolgi Burrito, flautas, chimichanga and Tacos. They are all delicious, but I'd have to say the simple burrito and taco are my favorite. A basic burrito with Bulgolgi...sounds so simple but it works deliciously well together. The man who is always in the front is a little grumpy. He never smiles and seems to be in a bad mood every time. The other people are really nice though. Regardless. I absolutely love the food and will be coming back many many times!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place. Nachos are outstanding, bulgogi burrito is superb, and spicy pork tacos are phenomenal! The flavors here from Korean to Mexican food mash so well together.. It's like they perfected it. Never once have been disappointed in ordering something from here. This is the tastiest fusion and prices are very reasonable for portions. I really wish that one day this place opens up on some busier street corners with late night hours, because I can see this being a popular late night muchie meetup spot! I highly recommend Komex if your looking for guaranteed good food and to try something new."}
{"text":"I knew that I was going to like this place before even stepping in. Komex is a fusion of Mexican and Asian...my two favorite foods. Their dishes are creative and very different. 

The fusion fries came in a huge order...very generous portions. I should've probably ordered the half order for my friend and I. The Bulgogi Tostada was my favorite dish...sweet and spicy. 

We also got the Bulgogi Nachos which were good but only the first layer...the toppings did not infect the whole order of nachos:( There was just not enough. The rest were just well chips...which are free when you dine in.

Although everything was delicious, it's also very heavy...Mexican food usually is. I wouldn't eat here everyday but I can see myself craving Komex and making the drive to indulge in these unique dishes."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of yelp to find good eats for a while now and this is the first time I have ever been so blown away that I had to write a review!!  This was amazing.  I had a chicken fusion taco protein style, in a lettuce leaf instead of tortilla, and split the beef burrito with my friend.  We both got a can of soda, only $1 what a deal, and it blew us away.  They give you FRESH chips, salsa, AND guac for free!! And some orange slices to finish your meal. The service was great and our total bill with tax was under $11.00!!! I can't wait to go back and thank you yelp."}
{"text":"BELIEVE THE HYPE.

It's a small place, with no fountain drinks (they have cans), in a neighborhood that is questionable and none of it matters. There could be bears in the bushes, snipers on the rooftop and landmines through the parking lot and it'd still be worth it here.

What's good? Everything. What's cheap? Everything. The sauces make amazing food better. 

Get this food to go (call ahead, it takes a little bit) and then drive to Tenaya Creek Brewery for Amazing beer. YOU MUST DO THIS. I want to go back right now."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a bunch of us. First time for me.

The menu is very interesting, Korean Mexican Fusion food. We ordered the Fusion Fries, fries, topped with salt, cheese, and Bulgogi beef. It actually tasted pretty good!

Bulgostrami, Bulgogi beef & Pastrami sandwich. It was a huge portion! The mix of taste was pretty interesting, in a good way. The sandwich was so big, I shared it with my friend.

Definitely will come back to try the other items in the menu!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good 
Service was excellent, parking was a bit of a hassle, but otherwise great place to try"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good I got bulgogi fries I wish the fries were a little crunchier and there needed to be more meat on it.
Chicken taco didn't have as much flavor as I hoped but my boyfriend got the shrimp taco and that was delicious"}
{"text":"We found this place a few years back and it's been a staple must go to when in Vegas! The fact that there are 2 locations makes it even better, so make sure to check the hours of operations as 1 of them is always open.
The whole concept of Korean and Mexican food fused together should speak for itself! Amazing options and generous portions. Pricing is great as well and they even give you a discount if you pay cash."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places i could eat here everyday!:) Service is usually pretty quick and the staffs are so nice. Free chips and salsa the moment you sit. We always end up ordering Fusion Bulgogi Nachos less the jalapenos, it's really good!! Just a tip: Make sure to request for their Korean sauce, it goes well with anything!"}
{"text":"My BF and I are foodies, came for a weekend and were in an adventurous food mood (as always) & came across this place on Yelp!! I have to say I was reaaaalllly happy with what I ate, I had 2 lettuce cup beef bulgogi tacos and a small wonton soup (which was bigger than I expected, of course a good thing) my BF had the beef bulgogi burrito.. And we were both very pleased! Would definitely come back & I have to mention I loved that it was off the strip!! Las Vegas has some great food, overrated places on the strip and GREAT food surrounding it !"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas and a friend showed me this place. First time here and love the food. The only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review would be the service. This is a small hole in the wall looking joint with amazing fusion food but the service disappointed me. The waitress was so aggressively in a hurry I simply just said ok to anything she said and she moved on. I understand the place is small with a lot of traffic and she does move fast, however, she rushed my table when ordering and no one appreciated that. Other than that this place is great."}
{"text":"Less busy than the original site, but all the great flavors are still here.

Ordered fusion tacos and chimichanga as well as a bulgogi plate and kimchi fried rice. Everything was absolutely flavorful and delicious, achieving the balance of mexican and korean. 

Portions were huge for the price too.

I Highly Recommend planning to make a stop here if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good salsa, great guac & chips. The pork belly taco was delish. Beef bulgogi bowl with egg was spicy. Perfect for a cold night. Friendly service. Nice to have another neighborhood hit!"}
{"text":"Ok, I heard about this place from a friend on Twitter.  Their Twitter account is:
http://twitter.com/FusionTacos

If you mention that you found them on Twitter, you will get a FREE drink with your order.

From what my friend told me, they were a little hard to find as they are located inside a little Carniceria at the back of the strip mall on the corner of Decatur & Vegas Dr.

The place is a little hole in the wall type setup.  They offer both Mexican & Asian Teriyaki Bowl type entrees.  The fusion tacos comes in 3 types....Bul Gogi (beef), Daeji Gogi (pork), and Dak Gogi (chicken) Tacos.  I forgot about these when I got there and ordered a Carne Asada burrito & a Carne Asada taco....my son ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl....go figure. (see pics)

The Carne Asada burrito was very good.  The beef was flavored nicely and the beans and rice were just the right portion....also, you can't go wrong for $3.99....that's really cheap for that quality of a burrito!  The tacos were excellent too and priced just right at $1 ea.  My son said he loved the Chicken Teri-bowl, but it was too much for him so he took 1/2 home for later.

Overall this place has good value and I also like how you can get Mexican soda here....which is flavored with Natural Sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup......I just can't say no to that soda!

Will I return?  Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Very reasonable prices,never had a bad meal yet,my son & I have been going here for years!!"}
{"text":"Cute little hang out spot. I wish I lived closer! I would definitely come back here to try new items. 

The server was great. Fast and quick to attend to our needs. 

What to order:
Bulgogi tater tots - my favorite item on the menu
Pork belly musubi - so big. I want to try it with the spam next time 
Bulgogi cheese steak - also, another favorite item on the menu. Cheesy and juicy 
Kim chi fried rice with egg - I was expecting it to be in one of those oven bowls where the rice gets crispy. Wish it was! Still good though
Tacos - alright 

Give this place a try! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It was pretty dead because it was fight night. The service was friendly and fast. We tried the specials and they were very tasty. I also adored the calamari taco wrapped in lettuce. Oh my it was good!!!. Hubby really enjoyed pork belly taco and pork belly on a stick. He is stuck in a pork belly rut. Nice flavors. We will be back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly super bomb spot in the middle of nowhere. Korean fusion food. The kimchi fried rice is spicer than the usual so beware, bomb regardless!"}
{"text":"First Korean Mexican fushion I've ever went to!

In the morning, it was empty - the waitress was very nice and kept checking up on us and talked to us sweetly; really brightened my day!

Ordered the dak-bulgogi burrito with kimchi: And OMG, the kimchi was really good, pretty authentic kimchi - just like the type my grandmother makes :)

The burrito was HUGE - (And not in that way, for the minds in the gutter lol), and stuffed with friend rice, lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, pico de gallo, cilantro, and dak-bulgogi (which is korean chicken). 

Only wish that the hot sauces were more spicier, they didnt have any form of spice to me! But will come back again :)"}
{"text":"We came here looking for something different and got the best of both worlds. I ordered the bulgogi enchiladas and they were awesome. Great service! I love when a place is on top of your refills! Only suggestion is they could label their sauces."}
{"text":"So I wade in again amongst the Vegas hicks, I mean food critics.

This food is GOOD,  never had a bulgogi burito but everything else I ever ate here was great!  Chicken taco, fried rice, heck there is nothing bad here.

And the Teryaki chicken is the best you will ever eat!"}
{"text":"Great place if you want some bulgogi stuffed inside a torta or burrito! The (I'm assuming) owner was all hands on. He took our orders, cooked the food, served it to us, and bid us farewell. The food was cooked to order, so our cheese steak and torta came out pipping hot and juicy! It was loaded with meat, and the torta was jammed pack with Mexican and Korean flavor. The only complaint that I had was with the musubi; it was jammed packed with rice with a thinly sliced piece of spam on the top. Make it smaller, cut out some of the rice, and a slightly thicker slice of spam, and you could still sell it for $4."}
{"text":"I'm in town often for business, so I'm always looking for the best eats off the strip. So, as usual, Yelp led me to the best. I'll admit, when I walked in I was expecting to see a menu or listing of items on the wall, or even some Komex signage inside, but instead I was stuck standing at the counter looking stupid. I wondered if I was even in the right place. It is a little hole in the wall. Nobody asked if I needed help or wanted to order. Finally, after having stood at the counter for some time I asked for a menu. Everything sounded good.  I couldn't decide on the bulgogi tacos or burrito. Naturally, I went with BOTH. And, of course I couldn't leave without the chips and guacamole. The chips were the bomb! Korean BBQ AND Mexican? Freakin GENIUS!!! Komex please make your way to San Diego!

Everything was SO good. This is definitely one of my new favorite places to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pros: I have tried almost every dish (bulgogi burrito is my favorite) and I studied my board exams here.  If I had to decide my last meal, it would be at KoMex Fusion, because every dish has the perfect flavor profile.  I love their Nachos too.  They also have their own parking spots. 

Cons: none. They have a small kitchen and shorter staff, but they only have about 10 tables, so service is perfect.  However, you might need to wait in line if there's a rush.  

This is a \"hole in the wall\" restaurant and easily be missed.  I would give this restaurant 6 stars if I could!
I also do a lot of take-out orders from this place."}
{"text":"Saw Komex on a BuzzFeed video, knew I had to try it the moment I saw it. While traveling from California I paid a visit and it was DELICIOUS. The chicken bulgogi fries are to die for. The waiters are extremely friendly and nice so that's a plus! Please open a location in Los Angeles!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and low prices. What else can you ask for. One of the best places in Vegas. Everything we ordered tasted great even the kids loved it."}
{"text":"Yelp hot spot for sure that actually lived up to it's expectations. The atmosphere is definitely not the best considering the location is in a run down shopping center. Oh well, it's all about the food right? Although on the plus side they did change the tables and chairs since my first visit which was last year. My first time here I tried the fusion burrito with chicken, pretty delicious I must say and wayy cheap too about $5ish. A little on the spicy side, but most chicken dishes that are Mexican are typically spicy to begin with. Most people like the heat, but for me I definitely drank all my water before finishing the burrito. My second time I came in a huge group with 20+ during lunch on a Sunday. Fortunately they had an area that was reserved, I don't know who it was for, but they obviously had to seat us there since there was no where else. The service was really good considering how big our group was and they accommodated all of us having separate checks. I had the bolgogi fries, which I had high hopes for and it was good but was missing the \"fresh factor.\"  I don't think I would order this again and stick the basics next time I come."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious as fuuuuu. The burritos and chimichangas are huge ( not exaggerating). The service is awesome aswell and it's only one server."}
{"text":"If you want great food, excellent service and a lot of it.....come here!  My burrito was huge....and my son's PBBLT was yummy!  I can't say enough good things about this place.......we'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Besides the booze, clubs, gambling, and all the other glitz and glamour that makes me want to come back to Vegas, this place is up there!

As a Californian, I've had my fair share of Korean-Mexican food (hello bool, Kogi, and Calbi trucks).  When I found out there was a dedicated Korean-Mexican food place on yelp in Vegas, I couldn't help but have to try it.  Dare I say, it is better than all the Korean-Mexican food trucks in LA?! 

I recommend ordering bulgogi as your meat choice in whatever you order. We ended up ordering the bulgogi quesadilla, bulgogi flautas, and the half order bulgogi fries.  All were absolutely delicious.  Their bulgogi is moist and full of flavor.  The portions were huge, better than what I expected.  For the two of us, we barely finished most of those three dishes even though we were starving. The bulgogi fries are basically a carne asada fries but WAY better since they use bulgogi and the Korean hot sauce complements it well. A half order of fries is enough for three people to share.

Although it is located away from the Strip, trust me it is worth the drive out of the glitzy area to this place.  It is located off of Buffalo and Flamingo and is inside the same plaza as BabyStacks.  There is a decent amount of sitting and prices were reasonable with most dishes being under $10.  This location closes on Mondays while the other on Decatur Blvd closes on Sundays.

Needless to say, this place is on my must go to eats list in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time with my friend that was visiting from SF. There's a bunch of cheap places in sf, but he said he would love to have this place again and def hasn't tried anything like it.

I tried the fusion chimichanga with bulgolgi and shared the bulgolgi bachos. These nachos are on point and definitely worth the price. The chimichanga was okay, but I think i should have just gotten a burrito. It was kind of oily and I think it was his the outside I wasn't feeling. 

The service was great. We got there when they opened so they were definitely attentive. They checked on us enough, but not too much that it constantly interrupted our conversation. I would definitely recommend this place for some good cheap food!"}
{"text":"Calamari taco and Tacodilla are outstanding!  For such a reasonable price and delightful personalized service, it might just be the best meal deal in Vegas.   What a great idea.  We need one of these in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My wife and I got takeout from Komex and they were nice enough to make our order even though we arrived a couple minutes after closing. The food was delicious and what I was hoping from a Korean/Mexican place at a very reasonable price. 

My only complaint is that the menu is a little hard to read since all of the items start with the word Fusion. I get that it is the brand and all, but it is hard to scan a menu when everything starts with Fusion."}
{"text":"I hate hate hate fusion places but my girlfriend wanted to try this place out so I agreed. Why do I hate fusion? I'm a firm believer in foods tasting better as they were intended to be eaten, and boy was I right about KoMex.

Arrived to a empty restaurant wandering around looking lost for any sign of life to be seated, few minutes later a lady popped her head out of a curtain asking if we would like to be seated, 'um yes?' We decided our order through the pictures already pointed out on yelp and ordered the Bulgogi Fries, Chicken Fusion Burrito to share. The chicken burrito was tasty 4/5 but the Bulgogi fries were soggy and didn't scream fresh ingredients in any way. Had mushy salty pickled jalapeños I would love to have seen some fresh on it and it was drenched in some liquid that tasted like sugar water. Maybe a double fry on the fries to combat this issue? Idk it just wasn't for me and while the chicken burrito was decent I don't think I would go out of my way for it. Service is nonexistent but this might be due to no patrons and having only one girl run the whole operations. It is fairly cheap $20 for two $15.81(food)  $4.19 (tip)."}
{"text":"Just had todays special, Bulgogi grilled cheese. Delicious blend of spicy beef with the comfort food grilled cheese was a perfect mix. I got the sweet potato fries too, they were thin, crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite place in the city for the last few years. The different food options and their quality are amazing. It is a smaller venue, so we like to go in that sweet time between lunch and dinner usually."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome. While the service was a little slow, I'll cut them a lot of slack on that because:

- there was a group of like 30 people that had started arriving a few minutes before us and was still arriving after we were seated

- the waitress was really nice, and very attentive when not dealing with said large group

- service was only a little slow despite staff being clearly overwhelmed

- food arrived promptly and hadn't been sitting under a heat lamp

So, beyond that, the food was absolutely delicious. I had the Daeji bulgogi burrito (pork fusion burrito). My friend had the fusion tostada (pork) and an order of wings. Neither of us was able to finish what we ordered, but we both really wished we could, because it was sooooo delicious. 

Total damage for all that (plus he had a large Hite beer and my Iced tea) was around $35, so two good meals here for about the price of one not so great meal at El Burro Burracho.

If you're at the Rio or even a bit further, this place is well worth the Lyft fare."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice service. Tasty delicious goodies. Chips and salsa and guacamole for free. Very yum. Had the bulgogi beef plate added the Kim Che rice. Super good. Nice flavor and sweetness on the beef and the flavorful taste of the kimchee in the fried rice was so delicious. My girl had the fusion flautas.  Bulgogi and mozzarella inside a fried tortilla with an amazing Korean hot sauced guacamole.  Really flipping good. Good eats will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place and is now one of my favorites! Had three different tacos, Kimchi fried rice, Bulgogi burrito, and chicken wings. All was so delicious! This location is more of a sit down style restaurant. Weird that the men's one person bathroom has a big gap in the door. It would suck if you had to go #2."}
{"text":"Ok first of is a dive. The menu is small and simple. Got your fusion, your Korean and your mexican. We try the Fish lettuce wrap taco and Calamari lettuce wrap taco, they both tasted really good. Also ordered the Spam Kimchi  fried rice. It was a 1st for me but not something that I will be crazy about it. Still was good and finish the whole plate. Service was a 5 star, all the time on top of you. 

2 interesting things that is a place, I guess, very well known by Metro. I felt like I was at a court house break room or something. Now when I saw the Health Dept. inspector eating there! That's a super plus for the business. We'll done and we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Our whole experience was wonderful- from the service (quick and our waitress was lovely) to the delicious food to the ambiance- this place is a little gem! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"What a difference a year can make. I honestly created a Yelp account to rave about this place. It used to be amazing. However, the second location opened pretty recently, and it was a extremely disappointing the last time I had it.

Being a frequent customer for the past year or so, I did not hesitate to buy $40 worth of food for the family. I always tell my friends about this place. Unfortunately, something happened here recently (maybe a new chef), and the quality decreased significantly. Here's the meal we had:

Fusion Burrito: Soggy. Extremely soggy. It tasted like somebody drenched the greens inside with water and removed any semblance of rice and meat. I could barely eat half of it. This used to be a favorite of mine!

Fusion Quesadilla (with spicy pork): Also disgusting! I don't know how you mess up spicy pork and cheese. I got this for my little niece, and she barely had two bites. I thought something was wrong with her, so I tried it too. Straight to the trash... How can a quesadilla have a weird aftertaste?

Shrimp Taco: The shrimp was definitely old. The aged seafood smell spread strongly throughout the house.

We had a few more things, and they were adequate I guess. The aforementioned items were the worst.

I'm so, so disappointed. I'm tempted to leave one star, but I put two out of respect for what the restaurant once was. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but what I received was inexcusable."}
{"text":"Took some friends here that was visiting.  This place puts vegas to shame!  Decor and customer service at its worst!  The food was eh ok I rather spend my money on either a korean bbq joint or going to a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here with my family trying to find a place that had bulgogi that rivaled living in Korea! It was good by far the closet I've had since being in the states. The only cons for me was they had know way to make it spicy other than putting Texas Pete hot sauce on our table. I also didn't like that their Korean wings tasted like soap they were so hot out the grease what ever sauce they put on them couldn't be found by my taste buds!! I did enjoy the different ways they used bulgogi in burritos. I'd return only for the basic bulgogi and rice!!"}
{"text":"He was craving tacos, I was craving rice. Enter KoMex. The surrounding area is a bit sketchy but I'll go anywhere for some good food. Based on the reviews, I was expecting a truly outstanding meal. 

Bulgogi w/ white rice -- I will go as far and say the quality of the meat was top notch. Not a piece of fat in sight. However, the meat didn't have much flavor. Eating it with the white rice didn't help the cause either. They do sprinkle sesame seeds on top. It gives it a little color and some lively texture but that's about it. Not oily at all which is a plus.

Their tacos come loaded with your selected main ingredient and pico de gallo. You'd think two measly little tacos wouldn't fill you up but it surprisingly gets you pretty satisfied. 

KoMex does the trick when you're craving for some Korean Mexican fusion food in Vegas. However, I might think twice the next time and hold off my cravings until I go to LA."}
{"text":"Best food I had for a long time. Good portion, with that little spice that make it taste perfect."}
{"text":"Mmm, I think I could eat here everyday!  So far, tried the torta, sliders and kimchi fried rice. All yummy! 
Found a bone sliver in my bulgogi once, but won't that that ruin it for me. 
Go early or prepare to wait!
Staff is more busy than friendly, but once you sit down and order, your food comes out pretty quick - and did I mention yummy?
I'd give this place one more star if the place could accommodate all the people who eat here and they had enough help who didn't seem uptight all the time. 
It's stressful wondering if you'll have to wait (& how long) for a seat every time you come here."}
{"text":"Another fantastic lunch at KoMex!  We had the bulgolgi tacos with KimChi, chicken fettucine, and bulgolgi fusion burrito. Service was prompt.  I watched as the waitress served everyone in the room and made sure to refill our water before we needed to ask.  Always worth a star for me!  Great experience!  Alot of regulars there which is always a great sign..  YUMM!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! We shared the flautas and bulgagi(?) chicken and beef plate ( added the stir fried vegetables). It was all amazing, loved the flavors. The fusion guacamole on the flautas was delish! Service was wonderful and very friendly. Definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"This is my favorite fusion food diner. The service is great, food is amazing, and the atmosphere is a thumbs up. Its a small chain but has a bright future ahead of them. My friends and family love this place also! I recommend the fusion burrito, fusion nachos, and/or the bulgogi cheesesteak  sandwich. It is a little greasy but I'm here for a good time, not a long time!"}
{"text":"Whew, let me tell you, if there is an open parking space: 1) park 2) Dash inside 3) get a table!

This place is really popular.  So unique, too. On the surface, Korean/Mexican/Chinese fusion does not sound like it should work.  Well, as you can tell by the reviews & ratings, it does work & work well.

Also, come hungry, because the portions are, ahem, large.  Cheap, too!  Lotsa food & cheap, what every growing boy needs, right?

I had a Pork Bulgogi taco & Chicken bulgogi fried rice.  The classic, eyes too big for my stomach situation.  The taco was tasty & spicy, with a mild sweetness (bulgogi, of course). It was pretty big for a street taco, but, I think that is becoming the trend for street tacos. The chicken fried rice was more than plentiful, with chicken, egg, carrots, peas, & scallions.  Some ginger & garlic in there, too I think.  Light on the soy sauce which is a welcome change from street corner Chinese fare.

The place itself is pretty tight on space & the food takes a bit to prepare, but this is not fast food.

If you're in the area, you owe it to yourself to drop in & try."}
{"text":"Great food!
You have to try the Fusion Bulgogi Nachos, possibly the best nachos ever! Meat, Mozzarella Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapeno & Spicy Korean Hot Sauce.

Inexpensive (not cheap), 2 people, 4 dishes (took half of 2 dishes home), drinks (iced tea), tip, $36."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my colleagues and the food was great. The server was nice and it was a comfy environment. I had the bulgogi nachos and it was mmm, mmm good. Couldn't eat it all though since the portion was pretty big. Will definitely go again soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. A small restaurant with a great mexican/korean mix.  Anything with the bulgogi meat is delicious. There is a reason it's rated so high on yelp and it's not because of the high population of a korean/mexican mix. 

If you don't try this place at least once while visiting Las Vegas you have significantly diminished your experience there. If you are a local and don't go here on a somewhat regular basis, move to Idaho. 

Trust me, you'll love it and if you don't then you don't love america.. or mexico... or korea."}
{"text":"What can I say, besides great. After reading all the reviews on here, me and my coworker decided to go on an adventure and boy was it a good decision. Now just to be fair, I did not try many items on the menu, but the Fusion tacos were amazing! I am Mexican and these tacos are, in my opinion, better than any you can buy at a regular Mexican Restaurant! Yes, the location is not attractive at all but who cares if the food is soo good. 

Please note, the place will be closed 
from Dec 15- December 26th for the holidays:( 

So here is my final analysis: 

Pro: 
1)Asked for water and instead of getting tap water, we got to free bottled water. 
2) Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole, all free! 
3) Checked in on yelp and got an order of Wontons. 
4) The tacos we very good. Meat was juicy and soft. 
5) VERY Cheap!  Our bill came out to 8 dollars! 
6) Fortunate cookie and orange. 
7) Very good variety of food. 

Cons: 
1) I feel like I stole some food because it was that cheap! 
2) Might take a bit if you go during lunch hours."}
{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall place. The chicken fusion tacos were pretty amazing and so was the bulgogi burrito. We also had the yummy chips and salsa with guac. So good and so cheap, only spent about 10 bucks!"}
{"text":"KoMex Fusion-fusion Korean/Mexican food. It's unique, cheap and most importantly, flavorful. Parking is terrible here but when you are lucky enough to find a spot and enter Komex, all that stress and frustration is out the window. What you might stress over is that you forgot your elastic pants on to fit all that food in your system.

SERVICE
Fairly slow but they give you complimentary chips which comes with salsa and guacamole. Enjoy those chips while they prepare your food. 

FOOD
My favorite is their fusion taco. I like mine with beef and or chicken. I also like to substitute pico de gallo for kimchi which adds a nice kick. These things are $1-$2 and is off the hook. Make sure to order 2 or 3 of them since each taco is small and won't fill you up. 

I've also gotten their bulgogi cheesesteak. Flavorful bulgogi but too much cheese for me personally. Huge portion. 

Burritos here are humongous. Half of this will fill you up. It just means you have the other half of burrito to take home and enjoy the next day. Packed with goodness and it's so good. 

CONCLUSION
Perfect as late night food except they are not open late. You definitely get the bang for your buck. Good food with slow service = 4 stars."}
{"text":"Located a few miles off the strip, but toOOOOOootally worth it.

The concept here should be nothing new to anyone that doesn't live under a rock: Mexican-Korean fusion food... Think Kogi Truck, but in my opinion it's better: You don't have to track Komex down via twitter/fb, and there's no 1 hour+ outdoor wait for a food truck parked in a random lot. Best of all, there's a place to sit & enjoy the fantastic food right away, as it is being served to you by the friendly owners.

We ordered: 
- WonTons: Free via Yelp check-in, and they were yummy yeah, aw yeaaaah.
- 2 pan fried bulgogi (Korean beef) tacos - The special of the week. If you ever get this one, make sure you devour it while the taco shell is still hot & crunchy.
- Fusion chicken tacos: Fabulous chunks of grilled juicy chicken meat
- Fusion spicy pork burrito: The gf & I split this. Don't be intimidated by \"spicy\" pork - as with most Korean-style spicy pork, it's only mildly spicy if anything. For those that aren't too fond of kimchi, you can ask them to leave it out. But really, this burrito was originally designed to be eaten with the fresh kimchi cabbage to enhance the overall fusion experience.
- Bulgogi Fries: Think carne asada fries but with the bulgogi (slightly sweet marinated Korean beef) instead. This thing was massive.. since the 4 of us had wontons, chips, and like 3 tacos and half a burrito each, we weren't even able to finish these delicious fries.

- Free Chips & Guacamole/Salsa - The freshly fried homemade chips  were so awesome that we had to ask for more. I also couldn't believe that these free chips also came with guacamole. There was the traditional Mexican salsa, traditional Korean red pepper paste (a kinda sweet gochujang), and the group's favorite salsa which was sriracha (red rooster sauce) based mixed with some chili oil. We loved this sauce in particular so much that we asked for another cup of it.

The setting here closely resembles any other typical taqueria (their logo is a big cartoon dude wearing a huge sombrero) but offers much, MUCH more.

Thanks broham for finding another place to visit every single time we come to Vegas!

Cliff Notes: BOMB fusion burritos/tacos/fries/nachos with Korean-style meats & ingredients."}
{"text":"Excellent fusion for a cheap price. I had the bulgogi nachos (get the bigger size, only $2 more), which were fantastic. We also tried the Calimari tacos and the pork belly tacos, both of which had excellent toppings and were very tasty. 

I personally liked the pork belly ones more but my friend liked the calimari. 

All in all, great food and great value for a very low price. I would go back here again."}
{"text":"This review is for yelper Nelson's UYE!  When I walked into the restaurant I was greeted by Nelson and other cool Yelpers.  On the table were chips/guac and egg rolls with sweet/sour sauce.  They were good, I especially enjoyed the egg/spring rolls.

For the entree I ordered a fusion chicken taco and fusion beef burrito.  What can you say, it's what I came here for.  Fusion styles it was!  My taco was piled with chicken on top of chicken and my burrito stuffed with beef!  With a splash of lime and added chile/fusion and kim chee... oooo yyyuuummmmyyyy.

Nuts gathered here!

After our entrees we were given oranges and fortune cookies!  Nice little place, great find Nelson!  Thx!"}
{"text":"Several visits later and you still uphold the standard of Awesomeness.

But this time your awesomeness had me feeling guilty.  

Ordered the usual, fusion pork burrito and fusion pork tacos.  Pork burrito was actually a chicken burrito.  No, no, no.  Please ma'am, may we have the pork burrito?  Why of course you may and let me give you a discount for us messing that up.  5 minutes later pork burrito arrives.  No harm done but you still give us the discount.

A discount for mistaken identity of meat.  Are you serious?  How can you afford this on your already low prices?  Things are always perfect when we come here.  There is no need for a discount.  It was an honest mistake.  Now we feel guilty.

We love you Komex.  You know what customer service and satisfaction (and food) is all about."}
{"text":"Still small, still family-owned, and still the best place in town for some Korean-Mexican fusion food!

Don't think I've been here in a minute...so many places in Vegas to get a bite to eat!  But the wifey was feeling nachos, and I was jonesin' for some kind of banchan when it just clicked..KoMex!!

Inside is a bit nicer now with some new chairs & tables, I think a newer TV too.  But thankfully the food is still the yummy same!  I would almost kill for that salsa/Korean hot sauce combo they use, hits all the right taste notes!

We got the Fusion Nachos with Chicken and the Fusion Quesadilla with Beef to share.  OMG - still delicious!  Nachos were full of seasoned, grilled chicken, lots of cheese & jalapenos, lots of pico, and lots of that Korean hot sauce!  Spicy & cheesy!  The quesadilla was just as good, nothing but bulgogi beef & a ton of cheese!  So enticing with the perfect crust on the tortilla from the grill!  Crisp on the outside but gooey on the inside!

No Korean drama here folks, just some damn fine eats!!"}
{"text":"Okay. I must admit I was more than a little skeptical about a Mexican-Korean fusion place. Walking in didn't inspire much hope either. The place is tiny and was completely empty. What have I gotten myself into??? I was shocked! They start you off with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The four of us started off by sharing a half order of nachos. These were truly THE BEST nachos I have ever had! We tore them up! The chicken Bulgogi plate was fantastic! I got the half order with vegetables and couldn't finish. This is a definite must visit.

Update:  By the time we left at noon, the place had a line out the door and every table was full! Get there early!"}
{"text":"Wow. Best lettuce wraps I've ever had. I'm gonna be craving this place.... entire family had an option that worked for them and there differing tastes.  We will definately be back."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and I have never been disappointed. It is a very small, basic place but the food is amazing! Today my boyfriend got the bulgogi rice bowl which had rice, cabbage slaw, kimchi, jalapeños, and beef bulgogi topped with a fried egg. It was a good sized portion and my boyfriend really enjoyed it. I had the bulgogi tater tots. The came out sizzling in a cast iron pan. The tots were topped with beef bulgogi, pork belly, and bacon. On top of that was tomatoes, green onions, and sour cream. It was delicious but next time I think I would add a fried egg. Every experience here has been wonderful, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I had a good experience here when I took my mom to lunch. So this is a sit down place! They emphasize that they are not fast food. 

This is fusion Mexican and Korean food. Great concept! This is what I'd consider a whole in the wall.

They brought out complimentary chips with salsa and guac. Small serving but complimentary so not a complaint at all. Just a note.

We shared kimchi fried rice and a bulgogi fusion burrito. The kimchi fried rice was good! We got a full serving for $10 I think? And we added an egg on top which was extra. It was full of kimchi flavor, it was saucy, and the egg on top was delicious. We had it with beef as the meat of choice.

The burrito was kind of small for the price and wasn't anything special. I don't know if I ordered wrong and just got a regular beef burrito but the flavor of bulgogi wasn't present to me. It tasted like they used fresh ingredients but it really lacked in flavor. It wasn't bad but I just was expecting a lot more flavor. There was nothing that made it \"fusion\" except the meat but that didn't really work out for me. 

Overall I'd give this place a 3 or 3.5 based off of this experience. 

Some suggestions would be to change their service. They don't do the whole server and sit down thing well and would probably benefit to just do a Roberto's type of ordering thing. Otherwise they should have a real service. Like get a host stand would be step one. I don't want to go into detail but I just think this would really help. Or maybe a number system. 

Also maybe it was just me but they should marinade their bulgogi more. 

The Kim chi fried rice is really good though. They don't shy away from the Kim chi flavor and that's a good thing. My mom hates eating other Asian foods that aren't Thai and she actually raved about this. The fried rice was the saving grace. 

The young woman working was nice and I'd totally go back to try other things and give them another chance."}
{"text":"Try the beef burrito.  You will not be disappointed.  No cheese and Spanish rice came together in a good way.  All three salsa varieties were excellent.  This was my first trip but mos def won't be the last!"}
{"text":"Have you ever thought about getting bulgogi Korean beef and putting it in a nice soft tortilla taco with a splash of pico de gallo and kimchi? This restaurant did it perfectly. There's nothing like getting down and dirty with these tacos if you know what I mean. But seriously, one bite you can taste two different countries South Korea and Mexico. The beef is cooked just right, when the beef hits you  it that bam feeling like a A-rod hitting a homer, then the pico gives you that tropical feeling as if you were on the beach in cabo, don't forget to add lime to get that sprite going, and of course the kimchi that will really take you back to your roots. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I'm not very adventurous when it comes to my food. Fried chicken this, sausage pizza that, steak taco there! So looking at the pics of food here had me geeked to try them out! Haven't had them booked marked very long I don't think. 

Anywho, treating myself to lunch I hopped in and got seated quickly. The place is small and it was jumping!!! I was dining alone and the owner I assume, was very nice and explained the menu since I was a newbie. He was seating people, taking orders, giving directions to an employee who was either new or confused. So kudos to the owner for the many hats he wore while I was in there today. 

I ordered the fusion plate of 3 tacos. It came with pork belly, beef, & chicken. No fusion slaw, but kept the Pico. I should've requested lettuce too. While I waited on my tacos they provided complimentary chips & salsa, it took about 10mins to get my food. The beef was hot and good..meat in the chicken was cold, pork belly was warm also. All the tacos were on flour shell & they were good. Good flavors & plenty meat. I will definitely be back to try other menu items. I probably wouldn't come at lunch time next visit. It seemed a little rushed & fast paced, but it was still nice."}
{"text":"The guy working was alone and took a while to to take our orders. Which is Ok but  we were on an hour lunch and wouldn't have made it back if we stayed to eat as originally planned so we asked for it to go. I was excited because I had never eaten there and heard they were good and the menu I ordered from said pay with cash and save 5% and I actually had cash on me. I went to pay and the guy said he could not do the discount at this time. Why? I asked. He said it for dine in customers only. Ok but your menu doesn't say that and we would have stayed but we were already almost a 1/2 hour into lunch. I opted to pay with my card then after I had already given him a $20. He got pissed and took my card and didn't give me my $20 back until I asked for it. I asked for hot sauce he basically threw it at me. I told him this was my first time here and he certainly wasn't earning my returning business. After tasting the food I was not impressed. I will not be back. I can return with bad service for great food but not for bad service and bad food. I understand being stressed and running shit yourself I've been their but it's no excuse for rudeness."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fusion Tostada because it was what was featured in the TV program, and I also got the beef taco on lettuce wrap, thinking the fusion tostada would not be enough.

The fusion tostada was a whole lot of food, and it tasted so much better than I anticipated.  A truly amazing fusion of tastes from many cultures.

The beef taco on lettuce was a wonderful discovery.  I thought it could have been the one featured on the show.

Each of the dishes can be a meal by itself for lightweight eaters."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  I love Mexican and Korean food, so the combination hits me in all the right places. The prices are very reasonable, and I would definitely recommend this to all my friends and family. My personal favorite is the spicy pork fushion burritos.  Portions are huge, so come hungry."}
{"text":"I used to eat carne asada fries but I don't see a point now that I can get bulgogi fries here. To be honest I was very skeptical being a fan of both Korean and Mexican food and didn't see how they could mix the two, but now I'm wondering what I've been doing with my life before hand.

The tacos are amazing and even better if you order them as a lettuce wraps. Pork belly, fish, and bulgogi beef were all great though the calamari ones are a bit lackluster IMHO. I took the fam here when they were in town visiting and even though my dad has never been a fan of Korean food he's itching to come back just to eat here again. 

Not far from the house so I've been hitting this spot quite a bit."}
{"text":"I saw this place in an old RJ Best of LV poll as best tacos which seemed weird to think of as a Korean Taco.  I was really surprised how good these tacos were.  I ordered a trio of tacos which came very quickly.  One was spicy pork, one was chicken, and one was Bulgogi beef.  I liked the spicy pork the best.  I also ordered an order of Pork Belly musubi which was tasty, but not a great deal for $6.  Tacos are an excellent price for $2 each.  I will try this place again.  The staff was really helpful and explained everything when I said this was my first time eating Korean tacos.  They also have a straight up Mexican menu, but I like Asian so I decided to give it a go.   Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Went with friends and was not impressed. Friendliness = A, Food = C (bulgogi & tacos not a good combo), Kitchen organization = Fail. 

We were a group of six. We ordered directly from the menu, but the kitchen seemed to be in chaos. The first person got food 20 minutes before the last person. Some food was hot, some cold. We never got the chance to eat the food together. The tacos and Musubi were good, but any Korean-Mexican fusion style entree just didn't impress."}
{"text":"Started my experience here with the water server spilling water in and on my $1000 bag. Lots of sorry's and paper napkins given. Not gonna lie...its just a bag but it killed my excitement for trying this highly rated yelp restaurant though.

I am Korean and eat a lot of Mexican food so this is my cup of tea. Living in LA/OC also gives a lot of exposure to this genre of food so I was definitely excited to taste and see.

We ordered Jim's fried rice. Tastes exactly the way I make at home so my boys were happy to have a \"home-cooked\" style meal on vacation. I ordered spicy pork taco lettuce wrap and fish taco. I guess I should have ordered Sautéed Kim Chee with it because the pork taco was flavorful but missing the wow factor without Kim Chee. The fish taco was rather disappointing. Nothing super about it. We also ordered the pork chimichanga which was tasty but a little to oily for me.

Overall...the service was great but if the guy didn't spill water on my bag I would have given this place 3 stars instead of 2. Although i am a fan of local mom and pop shops I don't see myself going out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Bulgogi fries and Kim chee fried rice is bomb!"}
{"text":"I am an addict. They opened komex across the street from me and I started out on the pork belly tacos, the bulgogi burritos, and the chimichangas, but I have escalated to a full-blown fried rice addiction. their pork fried rice is some of the best fried rice I've ever eaten, I don't know if it's the sesame oil, or copious amounts of crack cocaine. But I eat the fried rice at least once a week"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a slow day at work to make the trip for lunch as this place is not close to the office at all. I was hoping it would be worth the efforts to go this far as the reviews were all so positive. 
Hole in the wall location kind of tucked in a small commercial center so pay attention when your driving by, currently there is a burnt down Jack n the Box as a landmark right across the street so use that as a landmark for the mean time. Walking in the place is small, not air conditioned and just kind of meh but given its location i dont expect to be walking into anything super posh either. 
I have eaten here now twice with the first time having the tacos 2 beef and 1 chicken both the Korean style offerings and they were good but nothing super spectacular in terms of flavor coming from the meat. The flavor of these tacos came from the kimchee and slaw more so than from the meat. With the special being 3 tacos for $5 i figured its not a bad offering. The return trip i made i picked up a bulkogi (beef) burrito for the $5 and i was more impressed with that as i think the addition of more meat and less filler product you were able to take the flavor of the meat more which was not bad at all but again nothing spectacular to tell mother about but it was better than the tacos in my opinion. I do like the fact that they offer you bottled water at no extra cost that was a very nice surprise, and the sliced orange after your meal was a nice touch as well. All in all for $5 meals its certainly a place i would go back to if i was in the area but i wouldnt go terribly out of my way to come back to."}
{"text":"I love me some Mexican food. I enjoy myself some Korean food. Fusing them together? 

Skeptical at first, now I'm a believer. This is good. 

This brings together the best of both worlds. You get the spices and the heat from the Mexican food and you get freshness and crunch from the Korean food. 

I opted for the Bulgogi rice bowl with kim chi / lettuce / jalapenos / white rice and, of course, bulgogi. The freshness of the kim chi and lettuce paired well with the heat of the jalepenos. This bowl is also huge. I came in with an appetite and I couldn't finish the whole thing. Another plus is that the service is very friendly. 

One note I found though. There was also soy sauce in the rice bowl. Soy sauce is fantastic but too much of it is miserable. Especially if there are these Mexican flavors in there as well. You should take advice from John Dies at the End and lay off the soy sauce. 

Definitely will have to experience more of this fusion."}
{"text":"Awesome food...we ordered several different items. We couldn't help ourselves. Everything is stellar starting with the yummo chips and salsa they set on the table when you sit down. Our kids loved it too. We were all fighting for the last bites."}
{"text":"I've always heard about this place but never tried it until today. Service was fast and prompt. We went around lunch time and there was only one customer. 

My friends and I ordered multiple items, mostly from recommendations off of other Yelp reviews. I ordered the beef kimchi fried rice and a pork bulgogi fusion taco. My friend ordered a beef bulgogi fusion burrito and my other friend ordered a chicken enchilada plate. 

Surprisingly, the best dish out of everything we ordered was the chicken enchilada plate. It was the tastiest and the most memorable dish. Definitely worth trying.

The pork bulgogi fusion taco was delicious! I honestly can't wait to try the other meats.

The beef bulgogi burrito was... okay. Mediocre. Nothing significant about it.

The most disappointing dish, unfortunately, was the kimchi fried rice. I don't know if we just chose the wrong meat to go with it, but it was not the best. Good spice level and the full size was a good portion. Taste wise, it was okay but it did not wow us. 

Overall, this place was good. There's a lot to choose from and it's decently priced."}
{"text":"the most unique yet delicious combo of ethnicities to ever clash! the fusion is actually better than Mexican food itself IMHO.....try it out, if you don't like it, then you're either a hater or you're not human"}
{"text":"I love their Won Ton soup. So good! The owner was our server and she was super nice. Love this spot."}
{"text":"I had a taco combo plate with a couple flavors. It was not great, and only ok.  Maybe there was so much hype and good yelp reviews, I expected a lot more. 

The restaurant also looks dumpy and dirty. It didn't help that we sat next to the bathroom. 

I would not come back only because it is a bit out of the way and not worth the drive."}
{"text":"This place is pretty hidden, but thank goodness for GPS, because it's literally in the corner of the plaza that it's located at. When entering inside, everything is plain, but don't expect the food to be the same way either...Well except the bulgolgi beef.

I knew exactly what I wanted when I went inside, so I went ahead and got the fusion burrito along with chicken. Once done ordering, I paid and waited for my order. They definitely take their time making your food and I'm not complaining at all.In fact, I like that, it shows that they really need to prepare their food. About 15 minutes of waiting later and my burrito was ready. 

The burrito is pretty thick and like most other places, but upon taking a bite, things were a lot different. It definitely gives off the KBBQ-esque taste with the kimchi, rice, and the beef. There's a nice spiciness to it and everything was great. I was sad that the wrap fell apart though and all of the food started spilling. (Luckily, not that much fell to the floor, because I was salivating the whole time I was eating it.)

The beef is plain though and is comparable to a $10 all you can eat KBBQ, but if you're going to compare the beef with those kinds of places, have a reality check. This isn't necessarily a KBBQ restaurant now is it? It's a Korean/Mexican fusion and it does a much better job than the Kogi Taco Trucks back home in California.

The burrito also came with a fortune cookie and mine said that with every burden comes a blessing? My burden today? Finishing my burrito, but the blessing is knowing that I finally found a place I really enjoy while living in Vegas. I'll definitely come back in the future to try more of the menu, including those fries."}
{"text":"First off, for what you pay, portion is way generous.  Pregnant wife ask if it will be enough to fill her... yup! She said she is way full. 

Fusion done right! Taste so good!!

I ordered togo but wait wasn't long. Plenty of seating for group. 

Bathroom was clean too.

I'm telling you, generous portions. 

Ordered: full bulgogi plate, beef flautas, half order season cheese fries w chicken"}
{"text":"It's actually been over a year since my last visit to Komex, so I apologize for the lack of detail in the review. However, my last update doesn't reflect how my current opinion, so I needed to correct my rating. Suffice to say, it was more than a little disappointing.

I went with a friend over an extended lunch. It was his first time, and he was pretty impressed. Unfortunately, I didn't feel the same way. Looking back on my at-the-time basic photos, I had some bulgogi fries and a chimichanga, most likely pork given my tendencies to vary the protein. There weren't any salt or cooking issues, but the levels and layers of flavor just didn't appeal to me very much that day.

I did greatly appreciate the sweet, fresh orange provided for dessert and the complimentary chips and salsa presented as an appetizer, but nothing has motivated me to make the trip from Henderson. I'd recommend sticking to more flavorful Mexican tacos or waiting to try the Korean-Mexican fusion concept elsewhere."}
{"text":"KoMex is delicious, fun, thoughtful.

I enjoyed the flavors in everything I ate. The food was savory and delicious. The tacos were generous for price, and offered both flour and corn tortillas.

This is my new favorite place to eat in Vegas!

Also the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place.   I have tried everything and loved it all.   Linda is so nice and the other staff are very polite.   This week we came in 3 times!  My kids get the regular Mexican style and I have to tell you that's really good too.   We love places that take care to make good food!!  If it looks not so busy in here, it's because they do a lot of business by take out.:."}
{"text":"I found the food terrible. The food was very bland, dry and left you wanting something else. Nothing Korean or Mexican about it....
I expected great flavor from a fusion place. The dining area is also somewhat dirty."}
{"text":"Very unique, fresh, flavorful and affordable. I paid less than $20 for two people. The placed was packed. Perfect hole in the wall find."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been coming here when it was ran by the old owners and we really love the food and have no complaints what so ever with the quality of food.  Our favorites are the fusion tacos (either with bulgogi or the spicy pork) and I love their kimchi fried rice with spam. We still come here quite often,but  do notice they really need another wait staff since they are always busy.  Also really wish they would stop running out of meat ... the last 5 times we have been been here they were out of either the bulgogi or the spicy pork :("}
{"text":"Had read a review for this place in a magazine, and since I love Korean food, my hubbs and I decided to check it out.  Of course I had a sinus inf when we went so I really couldn't taste the food.  I got the bulgogi plate.  I liked it, I should have ordered the kimchi as well but I didn't :(

Hubbs got the fusion fries/nacho plate combo with bulgogi meat.  It was really good.  The complimentary chips and salsa/guacamole was really delicious!

Of course the service was good.  Everyone was really nice."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight and it was all it was cracked up to be. It's a take out with same tables and no atmosphere (thus the 4 stars), but the service and food were both great and the prices are unbelievable. Who would have thought, bulgogi in a burrito or a chimichanga, but boy does it work (especially with the hot and tomatillo sauces - complimentary condiments). Could not eat the whole thing, but did anyway because it was too good to stop."}
{"text":"Korean Mexican fusion? The uniqueness of the combination and the reviews had me convinced I had to try it and glad I did. The portions were generous and flavoring was bold and unique.

My bf and I had:
1) Bulgogi Fusion Burrito
2) Bulgogi fries
3) 2 meat combo plate (spicy pork and bulgogi)

The fusion burrito was scrumptious and very flavorful as was the meats on the combo plate. The fries were a little sweet (b/c the flavoring of the bulgogi meat) so it wasn't exactly my cup of tea, but the other two dishes alone were enough to give this place 5 stars!! If I lived in Vegas, I'd totally come back and try everything on their menu!!"}
{"text":"Great quality food every time we visit Las Vegas.  It has been our go to spot for three years and counting. It's about a 15-20 in drive from the strip.  They are well known for their Korean and Mexican fusion dishes such as their bulgogi burritos or bulgogi fries but they also serve traditional Korean and Mexican dishes like kimchi, tacos, burritos, enchiladas etc.  We always order the regular bulgogi with rice dish because it's cheap and always packed with flavor.  I like to order the bulgogi fries.  My favorite!  Very similar to Carne Asada fries but with bulgogi meat.  And if you dine in, they give you free guac, salsa, and chips to snack on.  Prices are reasonable and food won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been to their other location a handful of times and love it every time I go there. But since I was closer to this location, I decided to give it a try.

The food is the same. Its always just as delicious, but the reason for this two stars was the service. The waitress made it such a bad experience. 

She had an attitude the whole time! From the minute we stepped in, she wasnt even welcoming. She had zero patience for us when we were deciding on chicken or beef (a 30 second discussion). She only refilled our waters once while there were only two other tables here. Not even a smile from this lady!

I love KoMex and I will continue to go, but definitely not this location."}
{"text":"I was looking for a close lunch place near work. This is a little gem. Ever meal has been delicious! I'll definitely tell the co-workers. Pay cash for a discount as well!"}
{"text":"Great and cheap food the pork belly taco is just fantastic
Very good fried rice 
The service is very fast"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for weeks. We actually just ended up here unplanned, this past Tuesday we were headed to Thai Grill but when we arrived there the closed sign was up with a note saying \"Closed today Tuesday because the cooks are tired and need a break, will open tomorrow Wednesday\" Okaaayyy?? So of course we were disappointed, we sat in the parking lot a min or two trying to find another thai place close by, I really wanted some Tom Kha soup and Larb.. Anyways, we didn't find anything and I noticed KoMex was right down the street, so to KoMex we went! Thank god we did, this place was AMAZING. We did have to wait for about 10 min, they were packed, it was around 12:30, so it was lunch time. Once we got sat they came right over to get our drink order and then asked if we were ready to order, only except we didn't even have time to open the menu, so we asked for a few minutes. 

We ended up ordering a half order of the Bulgogi Fries, a half order of the Chow Fettuccine with shrimp and 4 Bulgogi tacos. Everything was delish! My favorite was the Chow Fettuccine, so good. The only thing I didn't really like was on the Bulgogi fries, there was WAAAYYY too much cheese... if they would have put half of the cheese on that they did, they would have been better. Ill definitely be going back multiple times to try EVERYTHING on the menu.

Im giving 5 stars for the food and price. As far as service goes, it was eh, they seemed too busy to give proper service, and it doesn't help that the dining space is small and all the tables are a little cramped. The only other thing I would change is their hours, they definitely need to be open late, its the perfect place for drunk food."}
{"text":"Holy Crap - I'm not in the dark anymore!!!! 
Finally today, we made an effort to drive to the \"very much out of our way\" Komex.

Right away they give you chips,guacamole and salsa.

The Bulgogi fried rice was awesome and topped with the chunky hot sauce that is offered on each table was awesomer - (not an actual word, I know!!)

The BF had the fusion tacos with bulgogi - I thought it was yummy. He said it was alright but he was more excited by the house made chunky hot sauce on the table. 

My daughter had hmmm...take a guess????   = FRENCH FRIES!!!

Nothing special there other than the fact that they offer bulgogi fries.

I do not like the inside - it feels yucky and hot. 

The BF thought Komex was OK but I  would love to come back and try other stuff -  

Komex is tasty,different and affordable!!!!!"}
{"text":"what can I say about this place? It's damn good.. one server in the place but she had two people helping her.. She has it down tho..I watched her go from table to table taking orders and answering question about the menu..

Her answer to the food.. \"ITS BOMB\".. and it definitely was.

a \"half order \" of bulgogi nachos can feed two..
bulgogi tacos
and a bulgogi burrito.
tasted all three..all were \"BOMB\"

I can't wait to go back again.. that is all."}
{"text":"We ordered the fried rice, chow fettucine, and tacos. All were delicious. Huge portions and inexpensive. It's a hole in the wall but the food was really good. I think their tacos are actually better than the Kogi taco truck. The tacos don't have as much filling, they're small but flavorful and only $1.30 a piece. The other entree dishes are huge - sort of a Chinese style share dish. I am definitely going back to sample other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The staff were very nice, the establishment was clean. 
I personally did not feel that the fusion of Mexican and korean were done right. I have come here a few times and I have tried a few different things on the menu and did not find anything that I thoroughly enjoyed. Probably will not return again in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed the food here. My husband got the bulgogi tacos, and I got the bulgogi grilled cheese. Very chill atmosphere, will defiantly come back again!"}
{"text":"Paid a visit to Las Vegas and searched for Mexican food and this place was in the results. Then I filtered by rating and this place went to the top. Wow, lots of 5 star ratings so I just HAD to go down and see if the food was REALLY that good or did they just have 88 friends that put down great reviews for them. Well the answer is, the food is REALLY that good and now they have a NEW friend  (89th) to put down a great review for them. I don't think I can add anything to the reviews that hasn't already been said regarding how GREAT the food is so I wont bother to reiterate. But I will say this....I DON'T KNOW how these people make any money! The FOOD is SO good, and the portions are SO HUGE and the PRICES are SO CHEAP, I just could not compute how they do it. I even hinted  that the GIGANTIC 4.99 burrito that was STUFFED with tons of meat would cost at LEAST 8 or 9 dollars where I'm from. Hell a Chipotle burrito with sour cream and guacamole is around 8 bucks and the food here is MUCH more worth the money and MUCH more flavorful. I would go here over Chipotle any day! So, bottom line, go there, get full, enjoy the flavors, and you will be very very pleased that you did."}
{"text":"Really good food and nice prices! The bulgogi tots are to die for and the fusion wings had a great flavor to them. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Last night..... my husband and I tried out this restaurant for the first time. The spicy pork on the crispy rice tostada with their hot sauces mixed together is so good. Their Korean spiced wings, beef bulgogi plate, and the apple Soju were tasty too! We also had the beef bulgogi tacos which were average and the shrimp flautas were rather plain tasting and a little too greasy inside. They have beer, wine, and several flavors of Jarritos mexican sodas. We arrived an hour before their last seating but service was quick, informative, friendly, and very accommodating . We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I made my way down here with my partner in crime.  Always when reviewing food you must have a partner in crime so, you can eat more food and therefore give a more accurate description of your opinion.

If you go by yourself, you might not be comfortable eating alone and therefore can color your opinion and that would not be fair to the business or if you come with 6 people and they can't accommodate that can as well color your experience.  

Two people or three tops is the magic number to come an accurate and fair opinion of a place.  

The place was pretty ghetto.  I mean it wasn't even ghetto with a personality it was just straight up \"hey, look an empty restaurant! let's open up right now.\"  

But, I'm not reviewing a furniture store so, ignore it.  To the main course!

I ordered their tacos with lettuce all of them (I'm on a no carb diet so, given up the bread and taken up lots of beans and meat)

My partner ordered the bulgolgi burrito. We got chips and salsa and guacamole for free.

Damn, those chips are good! 

my tacos were huge and everything was fresh. no complaint from me. 

the bulgogi burrito was hhuuuuugggeee.  It's something you have to pick up two hands to eat with.  

I tasted the burrito a bit and the tortilla was nicely crisped.  The rice tasted fresh and not overly salted.  The meat was tender and the veggies in it was nice and crunchy.

Overall, for the price and food it was a great experience.  They deserve five stars for shaming other restaurants for charging heinous prices for mediocre food! 

personally, I'd like to see more of the flavor fusion inside of the food.

the condiments has a spicy korean paste that would have tasted good if it was inside the buritto.  spicy and cheesy is a great combination.

Or a lime alioli with cilantro bits would have been a nice sauce. Sesame oil is great and would have stood out really well with all the different foods.  

I honestly thought I was eating really good mexican food and it being fusion place just wanted the fusion part to come out to play more.

It's just a personal opinion and don't flame me for it.  I am still perfectly happy and plan on going back cause the waitress there is the best part.

She is so nice and kind and talked with me for moment and explained how their business came about and asked me how everything was.

Really cool people and on my next cheat day I might try their ghetto ramen.  (it comes with hot links! whoop! whoop!)

{"text":"Thinking of Komex, all i have to say is, \"GET IN MY BELLLAYYY!\" Everything literally sounds good. Everything is a punch of flavors and an amazing fusion of food blending korean flavors with Mexican touches that literally pair so well together.

I am in love with nachos. And my friend loves fries. The perfect solution? Komex half fries half nachos platter. Delicious. I ended up actually loving the fries more and my friend loved the chips better. How ironic? You get to choose your meat (beef bulgogi, pork bulgogi, chicken or they have tofu and  pork belly). The beef was the best option in my opinion for the nachos and fries. It really needed a sweet and bold flavor and this hit the money mark. Do come hungry because it is so much food we couldn't even finish this dish.

We also tried the pork belly on a stick which was good (korean bulgogi flavor) but it did need something like rice to cut the fat.

The torta was also drool-drenching worthy. Love torta rolls because they just soak up all the goodies and melt in your mouth. I definitely recommend that. We also had to try the korean hot wings. Sticky icky yasss! Love the blend of sweetness and korean chilli, however I could have done with more spice, salt and some kind of vinegar to balance it. Nonetheless it was really flavorful and I wish I could have ate it all. Perfectly fried, crispy, and just so flavorful.

The pork taco ($2) was just okay to me. My only gripe is that the marinades were the same. Same for the pork belly stick and tacos. I wish there were some differences between certain meats to really balance out dishes. But I mean overall, the food is really good and truly blends foods I normally crave for into one dish. I would come back and eat it again and try other dishes like the kimchi fried rice or the flautas or burritos. 

Definitely worth it! Wonderful, attentive, and super friendly service. Ample parking and seating! Prices range from $2 (small bites) to $8 nachos or $6 tortas and the list goes on. Definitely will fill u up and make you wanna roll out of the restaurant and take a nap!"}
{"text":"The food was great and service was genuine.   The spicy pork fusion chimichanga was great!"}
{"text":"Gross. This is not fusion.  This is like \"hey, your Korean condiments got in my Mexican food\".  When we got there the place was empty.  The Server was not in the best of moods  she was NOT helpful with suggestions from the menu.  The food was gross. They served chips but gave us(group of five) one tiny basket to share with one tablespoon of Pico Dee Gallo....no offer to fill the chips. The Ambiance was not impressive..old walls covered with a bad paint job. I will not be returning or suggesting this place to anyone. I love Mexican food and I love Korean food so I can't even say how disappointing this place was."}
{"text":"the beef & spicy pork fusion tacos are amazing! wonderful flavor & tender meat. the fried wontons are incredibly juicy. even the chips, fresh guacamole and salsa were incredible. amazing service"}
{"text":"This place is small but the best food ever. The food takes a lite time but that is because they make it when u order it, it's not food sitting around.
If u have not been yet stop by and get some amazing fusion food.
We stopped in on a Saturday morning just as they opened the doors placed our order talked a little and got our food. We went at a good time and a little entertainment. Only in Vegas.
So we were eating and another couple w/there children came in sat down ordered food a few minutes go by and I look at the door and see this blue Man looking in thru the window then he takes off I look over at my husband and say did u see that, he only saw a man walking away but another guy inside saw the same thing that I saw so he went to the door and looked outside, then another man looked out the door then this blue Man walk in the door w/his family I did not look at him thinking that he might do something to us but NO he has dressed up and in make-up for a charity event we were all so happy to hear him say that then the next thing u know the cops show up. The other places in the plaza called the police bc this man looked the way he did. I want to say thank u to the police that came bc u never know. The response was so fast, 3 cope cars. They came inside takes to the man we all laughed and they left.
With everything that has happened in the last few months. That police of Vegas.

Back to the food hands down the best u have to try it at least once and u will be back trust me."}
{"text":"We were three starving people driving into Las Vegas from LA and wanted something delicious to eat AWAY from The Strip. KoMex exceeded our expectations and I'm so happy we went!

* I had two Fusion Tacos with Korean Beef and Kimchi. They were amazing and I could have had ten more.
* My boyfriend had one Fusion Taco, (Chicken) with kimchi on the side and an Enchilada plate and could NOT stop talking about them after the fact.
* Our friend had the orange chicken and loved it as well.
* We also had chips guacamole and Salsa.

Our Total was :::: $17.31 Where can you eat all that delicious food at such a good price?! KOMEX is a gem and I hope everyone goes and tries their delicious food."}
{"text":"It was a pretty small, hole in the wall type of place- and I was all for it! Korean-Mexican fusion? I mean come on. There's a sign when you walk in saying that they aren't a fast food place and to have some patience with them, but our food came relatively quickly. We got the Bulgogi tater tots- bomb! Def recommend these! Two pork belly tacos, were pretty good but maybe could have used some sauce, hoisin would have been nice. And an order or spam musubi, you can't really mess those up! Over all we were pretty darn satisfied with our meal! I'm for sure going to make a point of coming back soon for another round of fusion!"}
{"text":"Great, unique and flavorful dishes! Family owned business so you always get fast, friendly and personable service with a smile. Portions are HUGE! Every time I go I always order too much because their portions are so generous, great vegan options as well! Love this place"}
{"text":"Went back to KoMex and had the fried fish and Pulled Pork sliders also this time.  Both were awesome but pick the fish if you want 1 dish imo.  Can't wait to try more!

Also, great friendly service both on the phone and picking up our order.  Awesome place!"}
{"text":"In town for a soccer tournament. We wanted to try something new. This place was by far the best choice we made on our trip. Great food, good price, and even better portions!!

Thanks KoMex"}
{"text":"5 stars because the customer service and the food was great! The waitress was really good to us especially, because my son was being a brat, and she really went out of her way to help him with treats etc. The food was very different hence some of the names (fusion). We for the bulgogi fries which were an a recommendation from previous posts. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Love that the food is freshly cooked and just the right mix of both Korean & Mexican!"}
{"text":"The nachos are so good!!!!!  This is our go to restaurant anytime out of towners are visiting.  The service is excellent.  Bulgogi!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

So I gave Komex 2 chances. The first
time I loved the nachos! My husband ESP loved it for their \"fluffy airy\" chips but the flavors were pretty delicious. The pork burrito was good but it was too spicy for this wuss. The chow fettuccine was yuck in my opinion. I like more noodles than veggies/meat and the ratio of meat and veggies was about 2:1 noodles. The noodles were all broken and I noticed in other pictures that's just the way it's made? I decided I would go back though after that...

My second visit we got the nachos again and I wanted to try the musubi and shrimp taco. Musubi was just your average musubi. The shrimp taco was soggy but that's what happens when you get it to go. Maybe if I had asked for the pico on the side it would have helped but I wasn't impressed this go around. 

I had some qualms about fusion food as other fusion places I didn't care for either. I like that it's fairly quick, but maybe I'm just too old school for the fusioness scene."}
{"text":"No joke, I was skeptical. (yes i thought you would laugh at I was skeptical). But the way they do meat here... good Lord I could just eat the meat by itself and that is exactly what I did.

So tender and juicy with delicious spices and made with a lot of love. I tried my buddies burrito and my other friends taco and they do a great job of mixing the meat with burrito. '

If you get spicy pork I suggest getting a little lettuce with it because it is refreshing and really pairs well with all their meat.

Spicy pork and bulgogi. I have nothing else to say really, I really enjoyed it and it is perfect for a lunch break.

THE VERDICT: Go here. It is great food at a reasonable price and it is quick and easy. Everything is easy to share, and even easier to keep to yourself. Because you are worth it, and deserve a break."}
{"text":"We tried KoMex, a Korean Mexican fusion joint in Vegas, because being from Hawaii, that's not weird at all. 

Korean is good. Mexican is good. Fusion is good. Sounded like a win. Besides Bulgogi is gold if done right. 

We got the bulgogi fries and bulgogi kimchi fried rice to share, my husband and I both ordered a bulgogi burrito, my girlfriend got the bulgogi chicken burrito and her guy got the bulgogi chimichanga. 

The bulgogi fries: delicious and what you'd expect from marrying decent bulgogi with fries and bold fusion sauces. Can't say I've had anything like it. Bars should take notice because I'd describe this dish as the drunk person's best friend at 2 in the morning. & on that note, unfortunately the fries are too soggy to be sober. So it's like yummy bulgogi fusion-ness....on mashed fries.

The bulgogi burrito was pretty great because we weren't expecting a Mexican burrito. We expected a KoMex bulgogi burrito. Whatever that is. It was so tasty I approved and my hubby liked it a lot. On the same note our friends raved about the bulgogi chimichanga and the chicken bulgogi. 

All in all not bad at all for being next to a gas station and such things. 

Oh, they serve free chips and salsa. Yippee."}
{"text":"Considering how picky I am about the authenticity of the Mexican Food I eat, and the fact that my wife is Korean, we were hoping we had found a place that would please the two of us.

Chic Fil A only serves Chicken, In 'n Out, is known for it's great hamburgers, Pinks only serves hot dogs. What's my point? If you do something well, concentrate on that specialty, and do it well. 

I ordered a Chimichonga, and at the server's suggestion, with beef bulgogi. It was a generous portion, and the flavor was decent. But it lacked the flavor of the ones that I enjoyed at a pure Mexican establishment. 

My wife ordered Kimchi fried rice, the standard for any Korean eating establishment. She was not pleased. She boxed up 95% of it, and we fed it to my under employed, and financially struggling Son, who was hungry. 

Interestingly enough, my Korean wife, who really doesn't care for Mexican food, ended up eating a sizable portion of my Chimichonga, and enjoyed it more than the pure Korean food.

The service is good, and prices are very reasonable. It's just that if I want Mexican Food, I will go to a Mexican establishment, that can be considered reasonably authentic. If I want Korean food, I need only ask my wife \"what's for dinner?\""}
{"text":"Good food, good service,  food cooked to order, can't go wrong with any choices and price is reasonable. One downside is they don't have  TO GO menu you have to go on the internet to look at the menu to order."}
{"text":"Always amazing always good whatever we get!! We never have any complaints and want more!!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing:  I liked the food at KoMex and thought that all of the food was solid.  I'm just a little confused at the overwhelming amount of support that comes off of the Yelp-o-sphere at how amazing this place is.  I mean, it's good, but is it really earth shattering like so many Yelpers make it out to be?  Perhaps it's because I'm a resident of LA - the undisputed progenitor of Korean/Messican fusion food - that I've become somewhat blasé to the whole scene...  for reference, your humble author cut his proverbial teeth on Jose Bernstein's Kimchi Burrito in 1996, a full 10 years prior to the inception of Kogi tacos.

Anyway, since Corazon and I had an early dinner reservation at the exxxcellent Lotus of Siam, we split a couple of tacos (bulgogi and pork belly) and a half order of the bulgogi fries.  As I said, the food was reasonably priced and everything was tasty.  I was surprised that they actually had table service at this restaurant, but all of the wait staff were friendly and approachable.  I am almost 100% certain that they are all close friends or family members of the owners.

In summary, it's always great to see local restaurants succeed and it seems like KoMex is on their way up after reading signs of future franchise options.  Despite not being blown away by the food like many other Yelpers, I was pleased with the quality and price and I hope continued success in their future endeavors."}
{"text":"We ordered the Bulgogi nachos, calamari taco, and Mongolian beef. All delish! Very friendly staff. We will be back."}
{"text":"After wanting to try this place, we finally got take-out saturday for lunch. Located opposite the car dealership (high school and golf course are other markers for the same side of the car dealership). You might miss it because it's in a little corner of a little strip-mall on the same side as the VCA animal hospital. 

I chose the full plate of mixed fried rice- chicken, beef, & shrimp (so I could share it with my son) while my husband got the beef burrito. I had my rice with the hot sauce and it was quite tasty. The meats were very good. The beef was especially tender and sliced thin. The veggies were cooked perfectly. I guess the only thing that would likely ruin fried rice is if the rice were mushy; but no issues here. My son liked it too; I just had to cut the chicken into smaller pieces. My husband didn't think it was anything special- I had a bite of his burrito and it was pretty good to me (but I suspect he was comparing it to Truk-n-yaki). I really liked the fried rice, but I saw so many things I'd try in the future, like the nachos, torta, or the kimchi fried rice. If we were to go to the Meadows Mall in the morning, I could see getting take-out from here again.

The vast menu is split between fusion and mexican. I wanted fusion, but that's me. Hubby said that there was a huge sign on the wall, stating \"items are made to order.\" He described the inside as being larger than a hole-in-a-wall and noted there were a couple customers inside dining. The korean man at the register highly suggested the tacos and burritos for a first-timer. And hubby loves burritos. 

Like I said, I wanna try other items on the menu. So, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of this mash-up, but I liked it. 

Came in here close to closing to eat some dinner. I ordered the bulogigi chimichanga. Mmmmm-hmmm. 

I can see that it can be a little off-putting to have the sweetness of some Korean dishes when you are do not usually find that in Mexican dishes. But it ended up working. Partly because I added some extra heat to balance out the sweetness. I pretty piled on all of the sauces that they had and experimented with different combinations. 

The lady that sever us was super sweet. I will be back when I am on this side of town!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place, mostly because Yelp seldom lets us down.
Coming inside we were immediately welcomed and seated promptly. We must've gotten there right before afternoon lunch rush because at this point there were only a couple of others besides us.
After taking a few minutes to digest the menu and make a decision, I went with the bulgogi burrito and my boyfriend the bulgogi sliders. We were then passed some chips, guacamole and salsa while we waited. 
It took all of three minutes to bring out my burrito. I was elated. I took a couple bites expecting my boyfriend's food to come out shortly after.....nope. I set the burrito down to wait until his arrived. We waited sometime between 10-15 minutes later. My question is, if my burrito was going to take 30 seconds to cook, why not leave it until my boyfriend's is closer to finishing? Terrible timing. My appetite was nearly spoiled by the time his came, and I now had a cold burrito to look forward to. 
The food was decent. It was our first time here, again, so experiencing the fusion was new to us. Bulgogi was good, nice flavor and texture. I don't know why they offer French fries with the sliders because they're plain jane, no salt, no nothing French fries that detract from the slider flavor. Omitting them entirely would be in their favor. 
We may go back if we're in the area. No need to drive out of the way for it."}
{"text":"Thank God for my overly check-in happy, texts like a 14 year old (but in his 30's) friend. Without you and your 12,000,000,000,000 check-in's to every flipping place that you go to, we wouldn't have known about this place, this one was worth the Spam. Now, STOP IT!

Not knowing what to expect, considering I've never really been in this particular part of town, we walked in, were greeted by the staff and we were seated right away. Feels like a Mom & Pop shop, love those! Fine dining is for the other word for CAT.

I had a vegetarian taco in a wrapped in lettuce vs. the tortilla. And the hubs had a bunch of other things that I can't remember, let's just say, I wasn't as hungry as he was that night. My taco was UNbelievably flavorful. No, it's not Korean and it's Mexican, it's FUSION, so everyone expecting one or the other, wth is wrong with you? Look it up in the dictionary!  It's a freaking mixture of BOTH, some of you need to quit being angry and just enjoy the dang food because it's GOOD, stop lying.

Staff was friendly. They were on top of drinks and checked up on us often. 

Haven't been back purely bc it's a bit too far from where we live, but we will be back, I think I'll have a craving soon..."}
{"text":"I'm going to be a bit of a party pooper, but I wasn't ecstatic to eat here since I've had food at their other location prior. I was hopeful that spring valley would be different. 

Bulgogi burrito- 3 stars. It was the size of my face, but I just think that I'm not a huge fan of the fusion Korean/Mexican food. I LOVE Mexican food, and something about the bulgogi just didn't do it for me. 

Bulgogi rice bowl- 3 stars. This was okay for me as well. I didn't quite get what was the big deal. I'd rather go eat a bibimbap. 

Pork bulgogi tater tots- 4 stars. How the hell did that happen you ask? I love nachos, and sour cream. This was a spin off of it, hence I loved it. I really think it was the sour cream though. My friend swapped the bulgogi for pork bulgogi, which was a good choice. 

Pork belly skewers- 2 stars. I didn't like the pork belly quality or the marinade. 

Interior is a bit \"hole in the wall.\" They serve alcohol, accommodates bigger parties, but the place is not all that huge. Service was 5 stars. They were very organized, able to do separate checks for a party 16 people."}
{"text":"Kimchi fried rice was so good. I didn't know what to expect since I have never tried kimchi, but this was amazing. I ordered the half size and had to share with my family since it was so big"}
{"text":"The cleaner, brighter location with food just as good. Komex was a huge hit a couple of years back and they haven't changed. They have a pretty large size bar with a single tv at this location, but it definitely doesn't have a bar feel. I guess it makes the restaurant friendly to solo attendees? 
We ordered the beef burrito. Bulgogi style with beef of course- forget the other meats. The burrito was bigger than your average Chipotle burrito. Really, really filling."}
{"text":"Back to get wreck, all respect to KoMex who break
Their neck to keep their service in check
'Cause oh they combine Mexican and Korean majorly
Free chips, salsa, and guacomole keeps amazing me
She tell me there is bulgogi, on the torta or french fry
But I order only a half order of bulgogi fries, I gotta take it easy
Hate to sound sleazy, but I tease me, with a pork belly musubi
And when I grub it, I got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fat guy
 
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
decent prices got you looking at the menu for the latter
But Im a little greedy
I have to order extra bulgogi cuz I like my fries meaty
Food cooked to order so it won't be there in a jiffy
My girl is picky, but she ate the chicken burrito in a quickie
If you want fusion, you can't tie this place down
But for strictly Korean, I look around"}
{"text":"I love eating here when I visit Vegas! Food is generally cheap and yummy. The bulgogi tacos are awesome. Ask for kimchi for extra spice and flavor. The nacho fries were delicious too!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place, great food, great prices! If you are in the area, I highly recommend KoMex!"}
{"text":"First time here we wanted burritos ... Was missing the white rabbit ! This place is awesome tons of fusion choices .. Salsas to go with the burritos .. Nachos with bubgogi was awesome ... Wonton soup was so good had an half order .. Should have gotten a full .. Everything is made to order so expect a small wait . The only complaint .. Is that all the sodas are cans or bottles so no free refills u have to pay for each can or bottle also it was pretty warm my baby was sweating inside"}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous post. 

The food is still great but man was I pissed when I took a bite of my chimichanga and was a toothpick in it. It poked me so hard into the roof of my mouth! Beware of the chimichanga! They really need to check peoples food before serving them.

There was no way to see it because was on the side of the burrito and it was covered in there cabbage garnish."}
{"text":"Why are you here reading these reviews? Just go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! amazing food, fantastic service."}
{"text":"A unique Korean twist on Mexican food with a Chinese fortune cookie at the end :P

We had the fried wontons(can't be beat at 5 for $1.50!!), spam masubi with fried egg(comes with 2 masubis), the bulgogi burrito, and bulgogi plate. Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly and only cost $25 for everything!! We even had leftovers! 

Free chips with guac and salsa(which is made daily in-house). That guac had to have been my favorite ever! And I eat a lot of guac.

Location is not as convenient but hey, not everything in life is going to be right around the corner from me :)

Definitely will be back and definitely recommend it to all my fellow Yelpers!!"}
{"text":"Sweet staff, delicious fusion food, and bang for your buck! We tried the chips/fries nacho combo, a calamari taco, a pork belly taco, and a pork chimichanga. All so flavorful and unlike anything we've ever had. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Thank god I like it spicy. I took some home to some kids not considering the spice level and they said it was too hot. So be mindful of that. I ordered the fusion nachos, burrito, 3 tacos each with a different meat, a lettuce taco with kimchi and vegetarian noodle dish. Because I was traveling, sharing and heard it was cheap. My favorite was the burrito, then the nachos. It was all good but I didn't care for the noodles (just me). The only thing that bugged me was the waitress kept wiping sweat off her brow and I was hoping she was catching all of it. I hope someone recommends her to wear a sweat band like the tennis players do."}
{"text":"Bulgogi Fusion Fries, Kimchi Fried Rice and some delicious grilled meats on a stick ( chicken, beef & pork belly). Everything was absolutely delicious!  Much nicer interior compared to the older location too. We will definitely be regulars here"}
{"text":"Delicious fusion chicken wings, Spam Masubi and Bulgogi Cheesesteak!  Super friendly staff as well. Plus they serve Voss water! Definitely coming back, I've GOT to try the pork belly Masubi. Great job KoMex"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever had a fusion taco. I have seen them all over tv. This was worth it. I spent less than $6 bucks for 4 tacos, chips and salsa with guac on the side, and a bottle of water. They are short staffed, but the person waiting on was so nice and was worth the wait. Where do they get their oranges they serve at the end of the meal? It was sweet and the best thing to end your meal with, light and refreshing."}
{"text":"Tacos were on point.... Pork was my favorite. Beef a close second and chicken 3rd. Slaw set these babies apart.
Main course consisted of the beef cheese steak. I put generous a portion of siracha. Cheese in every bite.. Freeking banging...fuuuugetuuuboutitttt.ahhhh. 
So so gooood."}
{"text":"This place is amazing place to go eat. . The portions are huge especially the burritos. I tired the fusion burrito with meat in it  its good . The other highlight of the meal is the complimentary guacamole with the chips . The price for the food is good. they even offer Stevia to sweeten the iced tea. I thought  it was great. Overall this is a must go to restaurant everything is so good you wont regret it."}
{"text":"This place blew me away! The sauce tray of 4 different flavors compliments their food so well. I had chicken fusion enchiladas they were so flavorful and went really well with the hot sauce with kimchi. Talk about comfort food...my husband had loco moco that had an amazing homemade gravy sauce. I will be back many times over. If it was closer to my neighborhood I would be here every day - it's addicting:)"}
{"text":"The fusion tacos and fusion burritos are very tasty.  My son is very picky, but he loves their Orange Chicken!  Great food, huge portions, awesome prices!  What more can you ask for?  Small family operated restaurant, and they make you feel like a member of their family!

If you open a KoMex in Orange County, I'll never have to cook again!  :-)"}
{"text":"My favorite fusion restaurant. The pricing is great, food tastes phenomenal!!

Here are my favorites:

Fusion Taco
Fusion Enchilada
Jim's Bulgogi Fried Rice
Fusion Torta

I do not recommend the quesadilla, it was too heavy with cheese for me.

One of my favorite restaurant to take friends that are visiting Las Vegas. Every single one of my friends loved it, even with me hyping up the food so much"}
{"text":"Great idea for Korea/Mexican fusion.  Korean burrito tastes great along with the korean tacos.  I gave them 3 stars because service is so-so.  I've been here multiple times and I am never impressed by the waitress/owners attitude."}
{"text":"Amazing fusion food with great sides and sauces. I'm a fan of their slaw and the flautas!"}
{"text":"Love this place & it's sister location on Decatur/ Washington...
They have great Korean/Mexican fusion dishes at a very good price.
Every visit, has had great, polite service.
This location seems to be a little larger than the other, but seating is limited.
This is not fast food! I Was told every dish is made to order, so it takes a sec, but so well worth it.

Add kimchi to your tacos or burrito for a special kick!!

The kimchi fried rice is outstanding...rivals an Korean place we have been to."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is good as it can get due to small size.

Just so you don't get upset.... expect a wait during normal eating times. 
(Lunch time for example)"}
{"text":"Good fusion burritos. Great service . Everything fresh. Bulgogi beef burrito is what I ate."}
{"text":"I can not believe others have rated this place so highly.  I was looking forward to going to this place but I was disappointed from the get go!  The chip and salsa was not good at all.  The chip was not salted properly and the two types of salsa served were just OK.  I ordered the burrito, and the meat was over cooked, almost burnet.  My lady ordered chicken wings and fries.  The chicken wing again was over cooked and the fries tasted like freezer.

Other than hot sauces throw away everything and start all over."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Nachos and fries were more than enough for two people. Bulgolgi beef is tasty. All the ingredients are fresh. The Kimchi fried rice is excellent! I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Some pretty interesting food here, a fusion of Mexican and Korean BBQ. Nothing fancy but good food."}
{"text":"I had to check out KoMex Fusion restaurant that was featured on BuzzFeed. Check out the Youtube video (https://youtu.be/tCqu3dxm56g). I literally had to try everything they ate on the featured video. I have to agree, GREAT HANGOVER FOOD! Decently size portion and prices for what you get! 

I tried the following: 
+  1/2NACHO- 1/2FRY COMBO with Chicken with Mozzarella Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapeno & Korean Hot Sauce = was nice to start of with something crunchy and spicy. A great appetizer to share with your friends. I would get this again. 
+ Bulgogi Tater Tots = Tater tots with cheese, bulgogi, sour cream, pork belly, bacon, and tomato. It is golden, perfect, and just the perfect amount of crunch.
+ Fusion Chimichanga with Beef = with Mexican Rice and Cheese inside. That is topped with Enchilada Sauce, Cheese, KoMex Slaw and Pico de Gallo. IS TO DIE FOR! I could eat this over and over again!
+ KimChi Fried Rice with Spam with Sunnyside up Egg on top = I love the kick of spice. but it's not too spicy. You cannot go wrong with this."}
{"text":"Great Mexican-Korean fusion food, and some American classics like philly cheesesteak with a Korean touch. We tried the Fusion Bulgogi cheesesteak sandwich and Fusion fries; tasty and generous servings. Your order might take some time before it's ready (a large sign stating that all dishes are made to order explains it), but it's worth the wait. Friendly service, good food and great value."}
{"text":"I had their bulgogi rice bowl. Just amazing! It's a small little hole in the wall place in a small little shopping center. But the staff was super friendly and on top of it and the food was amazing. My friend got the calamari tacos and I couldn't believe how tender the meat was, cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place.  I've read all about it on Yelp.  My girlfriend has turned me on to Korean cuisine.  I like Mexican cuisine, but she does not.  So, I had to rope my father into going with me.  Komex is conveniently located off the 95 at Decatur.  Just head North on Decatur and look for it on the left just before Washington.  There is not enough parking for that shopping center.  The decor is typical mom and pop, not super fancy, but it is clean.  Mostly booths.  Have a seat and a server will come by soon.  The place is small, perhaps six or eight booths/tables.  We ordered two Mexican sodas: one mandarin orange and the other lime.  They came in bottles and they provided glasses with ice and straws.  I tried both flavors and liked both.  The carbonation was strong.  The server brought out complimentary chips, saIsa, and guacamole.  The chips were more like fried pitas.  They seemed fresh, but were cold.  The salsa was very flavorful.  The guacamole was ordinary, but how many other places give you guacamole for free?  So, I'm not complaining.  If you check in on Yelp you get a free order of fried wontons.  I showed our server.  I went to the bathroom and was disgusted by the smell (the only unpleasant part of my experience at Komex).  The fried wontons were crispy, hearty, and flavorful.  Not overly greasy.  The dipping sauce was really tasty, kind of sweet and spicy hot at the same time.  We ordered two fusion tacos (one beef and the other chicken), bulgogi burrito, and pork torta.  The food all came out at different times, which I did not mind.  There were only two people working the front-of-house and the place was full (was lunch time).  Everything was flavorful.  I could taste the Korean and the Mexican and it worked.  The burrito and torta were huge portions.  Our server brought out some sauces, which were all good.  Upon finishing our server brought out a complimentary dessert, which was an orange sliced in half and the pieces cut out and then put back in.  Two little plastic swords were stuck in two of the slices.  Really nice touch.  Usually I skip dessert after eating so much food, but I told myself I had to eat my daily allowance for fruit and enjoyed it.  It was fresh.  Fortune cookies came with the bill.  Torta $5.99; burrito $4.99; tacos $1.29 each; sodas $1.29 each; wontons free with Yelp check in; fortune cookies free; orange free; and chips, salsa, & guacamole free.  The total bill was under $18 and we were stuffed.  Our server was super friendly and helpful.  It was totally busy, but we ate and got back to work within an hour.  This place gets five stars all the way \"Woohoo!  As good as it gets!\""}
{"text":"If I could give it  a minus 1 star I would.  It was so gross.  Not very well flavored at all.  I've had great Korean food before and this doesn't even come close.  I left there pissed that I fell for the good reviews.  The girl at the counter was super nice but that isn't good enough.  Our food was really awful.  The best thing about this experience was that we bought way too much so we were able to feed a homeless person afterward."}
{"text":"It's filling and good for the price. Something about it, though, makes it not that memorable for me. It's just meh. I feel like I need to pile on their sauces on the food for a kick, but even the sauces are forgettable to me. The bulgogi BEEF meat is well seasoned. Can't say the same for chicken. 
It is set at a pretty decent price. For about $8 you can get a big meal. A whole order of bulgogi fries could really feed two. $4 for two spam musubis. $2 tacos. I've had the chimichanga and burrito and nachos as well, which I think I may pass next time.
Complimentary chips, salsa, & guac. I enjoy the complimentary oranges at the end."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on yelp.  Based on reviews decided to give it a try. The service was excellent the food was of high quality. The presentation was nice the flavors were outstanding.

We enjoyed the smothered fries the flauta' and the crispy rice and then sampled the fried wontons. everything was done extremely well. Prices are very reasonable and I would highly recommend this restaurant. 

The food is prepared fresh everything was done to perfection. You may have to wait since the food is fresh and prepared when ordered. 

Customer service is excellent. Food presentation is very appealing. I could see this restaurant growing if it had a bigger floor plan."}
{"text":"Komex, just the name alone caught my attention! Being half Mexican and Japanese, who am I to judge for loving fusions! Especially Korean and Mexican cuisine. The tostada with the rice patty and the bulgolgi is amazing!!!! The crunch of the Komex slaw and the rice patty with the flavor of the meat is indeed a plate I finished all too quickly! Next my order of tatertots was just the cherry on top! The bacon, in different cuts mind you kept teasing my taste buds. The cripsy tots kept bursting with flavor from the bulgolgi!!! This place is sorta hidden, but I'm so happy I found this place!!! KOMEX found a new customer for their delicious fusion food!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a good honest man. I don't cheat. I don't lie. And I certainly don't steal. But KoMex makes me upset for making me feel like a thief! I'm actually upset that this place charges so little for the amount of quality food they serve. At the end of every meal, I get this guilty feeling like is this check a mistake? I can't buy this much happiness for so little. 

This place puts cheap fast food to shame. Try to spend $10 here for lunch and finish all the food they serve and you will understand. That's just speaking volume. Now as for the quality, my god! I can't even get my grass fed organic meat to taste this great. 

The other reason for the 5 stars, the Wontons! Fried or boiled. Unbelievable! 4 for a dollar is absurd. Now this is the definition of bang for your buck. Nothing in the universe can taste this good, per bite per $0.25 period."}
{"text":"KoMex is one of the few places that I felt deserved a review from me soon after enjoying the amazing food and service.  KoMex is a definitive reason for why YOU should rent a car when visiting Las Vegas and leave the overpriced Strip for amazing food and service.

I was in Vegas with a group of 12.  We rolled in and without batting an eye, the server smiled at us and seated us quickly.  Her service was attentive and always with a friendly smile and great attitude (even though we were a loud group).

On to the food!  The highlights of the menu:

1) Bulgogi Fusion Taco - So I have had plenty of Korean Tacos, some good and some I threw away right away.  This one was good for one simple reason, it came from a Korean cook.  The bulgogi and slaw were legit and the flavors were amazing!

2) Calamari Taco - I will admit, I am a huge sucker for sauces.  Cruising through the menu, I originally was going to get the shrimp taco but saw \"special sauce\" in the description for the calamari taco and knew I had to get it... and I was not disappointed at all.  The calamari was crisp but not burnt with soft texture and squid flavor beneath the batter.  The sauce was really damn good and enhanced the calamari with a sweet spiciness.  A must try!

3) Kimchi Fried Rice w/ Bulgogi - Honestly... do I need to say more?  The kicker of this dish is the fried egg with runny yolk combined with the kimchi.... DROOOLLLL.

4) Bulgogi Fries - Cheese. Pico de Gallo. Chips. Kimchi.  Bulgogi.  Fries.  Oh man, the combination of flavors, spiciness, coolness, fries, and other amazingness makes this dish sooo coma-inducingly good.  Try please, for the sake of you future children.

Oh, and the service, again, is AMAZING!

Get in a car and try this place now!"}
{"text":"I was craving some messy goodness so I decided to come here since there has been so many positive reviews.  

SERVICE BREAKDOWN:
When we first walk through the door, there were 4-5 seats with 2 people already seated.  I thought there was a line so I sat and waited to be asked how many in my party, etc.  Nobody stopped by, nobody acknowledge that we walked through the door.  

After waiting about 5 minutes, I finally asked the 2 people next to me if they were waiting to be seated since they just got done cleaning 2 tables and was told no, and that they were here to pickup their take out.  I was extremely unhappy since I was starving and really wanted food!  I actually reconsidered going somewhere else to eat... 

I finally had to stop a waitress and told her I needed a table for 2 and she told me to wait a few minutes.  Thankfully a minute later we were seated.  

After all that misunderstanding, the service quality quickly turned around.  The waitress, who I believe is the wife, was friendly and polite.  All the staff stopped by our table throughout the meal to make sure we liked everything and check if we needed anything else. 

FOOD BREAKDOWN:
Chips and Salsa (complimentary) - I really loved that the chips were made there and not the typical store bought ones.  The salsa and guca was not spicy which was fine since we werent told that it was spicy.  I did like that they had a spice tray (similar to the ones you would see in a Thai restaurant) so you can really make it spicier if needed ^_^

Fusion Chimichanga (Fried Burrito topped with Enchilada Sauce, Marinated Cabbage, Onions, Cillantro, and PIco de Gallo) - I picked the Spicy Pork as the meat of choice for this dish and it was flavorful but had no kick to it whatsoever.  I will say for the price ($7.99) the size was completely worth it ^_^ It was pretty much the size of my head which was totally awesome!  The chimichanga was loaded with the topping and served on a warm plate.  This is not something you cant eat with your hands!

Fusion Bulgogi Nachos (Meat, Mozzarella Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapeno, and Korean Hot Sauce) - We did a half order and I wished i got the full! This was my favorite thing out of the two items.  I wish other restaurants made their own chips cause it was what made the dish!!  I loved that you can add Kimchi without any additional cost!  It was so delicious that I need to go back and order this again."}
{"text":"KoMex was the first place to introduce me to the idea of Korean Mexican fusion. It became our go-to place when we wanted a delicious, inexpensive, homemade meal. I found it because of a Yelp review I read, and it did not disappoint. It looks a little shady on the outside, but looks can be deceiving. The food is wonderful, and the staff is friendly and kind. And it's so inexpensive!!! My husband and I would both eat a delicious dinner, and the bill would be 9 dollars for the two of us! You can't beat that anywhere in Vegas! The tacos are phenomenal, the chips are fresh, and the burritos and nachos are so good! Since we've moved back to the Midwest, I miss that place so much! If you're in the Summerlin area, do yourself a favor and visit KoMex!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype....



We had combo chow fun (thick noodles with shrimp, chicken and beef) excellent flavor, the sauce coated the noodles perfectly without being too greasy

My favorite? The pork fusion tacos, ordered 2 of each meat (pork, beef and chicken) husband and I agree... Pork definitely outstanding of the three, will just order pork next time.  

Ordered a Mexican coke with this, perfect

Only drawback? That this isn't closer to 
my home


Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in the place after reading son many good reviews and hearing so many good things about the place. I for one wasn't impressed at all. Everything was so so. We ordered the chicken flautas, spicy bulgogi chimichanga, bulgogi enchiladas, quesadilla, and pork belly tacos. The pork belly tacos were the stand out. I would order that again, the rest, just ordinary for me. Not great korean food and not so great mexican food combined....just ok."}
{"text":"Korean Mexican fusion- This is certainly in my top five of Las Vegas.
There are two locations I'm pleased to let you know! Decatur, just north of the the 95, across from Ford, and Jack in the Box, nestled in a quiet strip mall.
The other location is on buffalo just south of flamingo - also in the corner. :) 
This may actually be my favorite spot in Vegas considering big locations.
I really enjoy the beef chow fettuccine. I've ordered it, literally every time. 
Every time, I'm greeted with a perfect portion of chips and salsa. 
Very personable environment, usually pleasantly calm. Perfect for date night, or family night out. 
Both locations have the same vibe. A mix mash of bamboo wall screened windows, and a tv usually in the background. The Buffalo location usually has holiday lights :)"}
{"text":"This place reminded me of Yama Sushi for being crowded and limited on privacy spacing. It got so bad to one point my father was engaging in other customers conversation! Luckily, they didnt mind though. Lol


Fusion Bulgogi Nachos(7) were real tasty, just didnt like how the nachos were made at all. They were to hard to bite which made it less enjoyable. Lets say more of a vigorous crunch than a nice crisp. The Spicy Pork Plate(9) was deliciously moist, sweet and tender with the perfect bite to it! Comes with a whole pot of rice too (not literally). 
Comfort wise, it was just their bathroom that needs some work.

Some needs here and there but wont stop me from coming back to try more of their different entrees."}
{"text":"Tofu enchiladas?! I can't even find that stuff in LA!

KoMex is a gem. It's cheap, it's fast, it's unique and most importantly it's TASTY! I love the concept of fusion foods, makes me feel more American. :P It's awesome to see different cultures mix so well together! 

I came here before leaving Las Vegas. It's no where near the strip (thank god...I was growing quite weary of obnoxiously drunk and loud Jersey Shore rejects swarming the streets). 

We ordered:

Chow Fettuccine
- Chow mein but with italian fettucine noodles wok stir fried with red onions, cabbage, korean bbq beef, shrimp and chicken. All for $10!! Can't beat that, especially if you lost all your dough in Vegas.

TOFU ENCHILADAS!! 
- Sounds weird, tastes awesome. The plate comes with rice, beans, tomato, shredded lettuce and red sauce. (forgot how much it was tho)
 
There was also complimentary chunky salsa and guac and chips (with free refills!). And might I say, it was the most delicious FUH-REE guac and salsa I've eva haaaaaaad! 

Come here if yous a broke mofo.... or if you just love fusion food!"}
{"text":"We had been meaning to try this place for a while, but weren't sure if it would be picky-eater (aka, the kiddo) friendly so we went while the wee one was away on vacation.

It's tucked in a strip mall and the space is very small but it seems like a small operation so don't let that deter you from trying it out!

The service was more like when you go to a friend's dinner party and they're running around all crazy trying to play host/hostess... a little chaotic and sporadic but they get the job done.  Also, they are very friendly!

The food was great.  I had chicken fusion taco, the hubs had chicken fried rice, and we split the fusion bulgogi fries.  They also bring you chips and salsa to snack on while you peruse the menu.  The chicken bulgogi in the taco was delicious (btw, they are wee tacos,  so if you want to try different kinds, you could probably order 3 and have an entree-sized meal), I really enjoyed it.  We had a half order of the fries and it was plenty for 2 adults (and we both are pretty good eaters).  The fried rice was better than your standard take-out fried rice, and the hubs didn't cover it in soy sauce like he usually does.  

All in all, the food is great, next time I might just call in an order and pick it up.

They also had a note on their menu that the menu has been truncated to allow for expansion....  no indication of where the other location will be, I hope it's closer to me though!"}
{"text":"Awesome food at even more amazing prices.
I was in vegas and had searched some of the good places to try and Komex came up. I took my parents and we drove over. 
We each ordered a bulgogi burrito. we also tried a pork taco and a bulgogi taco. I have had korean fusion before, but this was even better. The food does take a while to come out, but its worth the wait. 
Oh and while you are waiting for your food-they serve homemade chips  with guac and salsa- delish! 

totally worth the drive from the strip. total meal for 4 of us was under $30 wtih tax-- yay! 
oh and they serve bottled water instead of tap as part of your meal- so nice!
Love you Komex"}
{"text":"I don't think I'm going crazy. But KoMex was just...ok?! For the longest time this place was THE #1 place to go to on yelp. My gf and I decided to make the trip out there because we have been on a taco bender for weeks. Plus, Korean and Mexican food fusion...I was convinced that I would like this place no matter what.

Welp...Although the service was top notch.  The food was very underwhelming.

I tried the Steak, chicken and pork komex tacos along with a big heaping plate of kimchi fried rice.

Chicken Taco - Lots of meat but I felt like I was only eating texture and sauces. Nothing at all stood out.

Steak Taco - I enjoyed eating these but compared to all the other taco shops I've been eating, this is one of the weakest steak tacos I've had during this run. I can't put my finger on it, but something was missing.

Pork Taco - Pretty good taco, everything was tasteful and I have no real complaints. Heck, if you stop by, I would definitely get one of these.

As for the Kimchi rice - I don't really know...it's a mindfuck to try to figure out why it was  subpar. No matter the amount of spices and sauces I would try to add, nothing brought out any real flavor.

I don't know if everyone is suffering from groupthink or if I'm becoming a pseudo-hipsteresque \"I go to great places before they were cool even though I never talked about it until after the fact\" nerd, but there are many other places better than this. 

I don't think I'll go out of my way to try this place again. But I wish I had a $500 shirt for them to spill water so I can yell, \"HOW DARE YOU SPILL WATER ON THE ROCK's $500 SHIRT? so everyone can know how hypothetically important I am.

{"text":"Went back.   This time I tried the fusion tacos.  They were wonderful.   You can taste the Korean meets with the Mexican sauces and ingredients.   It is a very unique and wonderful union of two great foods that normally you would not expect to be combined.    We also got the fried rice.   It was excellent.   Usually its hard to get a table during lunch time and thus we went a bit later and it was no problem.   The service and food were both amazing."}
{"text":"Ohmygosh. That bulgogi chimichanga??! Incredible. I wish I had not discovered that. It's way better than it has a right to be. Now I crave it. Tried to save half for another meal. Couldn't do it! Get in my belly! (mouth is watering, dammit!)"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Who would've thought to combine Korean and Mexican food? Who would've thought it'd be so successful?! The kim chee fries and kim chee fried rice were amazing!!! Always always get the specials!! My girlfriend had the taco special for $1.90 and they were huge!"}
{"text":"Kinda over-rated.  The food is good and I am Korean so I can definitely appreciate kimchee fried rice, but maybe I am more picky because my mom can really cook."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly, and the shrimp tacos were tasty with a little bit of lime juice!  The bulgogi plate was delicious over rice and the only reason I didn't give them five stars was due to having driven all the way here to try their spam musubi.  I ordered two orders (four pieces) which totalled $8 and drove home to eat, only to find out they had been left out completely.  Everything else was good outside of that disappointment."}
{"text":"I reallllly wanted to like this place :( I came here with the expectation of tasting tacos like the Kogi truck and bulgogi chimichangas like Cha Cha Chili-flavored food (both LA-based Korean-Mexican eateries), but man were we disappointed. The only thing that was spectacular was the attentive customer service, but that's where it ends :( The free guac and chips were nice, but their chips are the super-hard thick kind of chips. I ordered the bulgogi chips/fries combo, and neither tasted good. Pork belly taco was okay. The flavors in my bulgogi chimichanga didn't complement each other at all. I tried mentally convincing myself to like the food, but I just couldn't. 

Maybe if this was my first time trying Korean-mexican food, I would enjoy this place. Komex has a lot of fans, so they must be doing something right! It just didn't jive with my taste buds. The waiter and waittress were very attentive here, though!"}
{"text":"When I first heard of KoMex Fusion, I knew I had to go try it. Before moving to Las Vegas I lived in Michigan, where we didn't have many Korean restaurants to begin with, nonetheless any that were infused with different cuisines. 

I'm Korean and Korean food is my absolute favorite. I couldn't fathom how Mexican food could be mixed into Korean food... The creativity that exists on the West coast!

I went with my roommate at the time and we got Bulgogi Kimchi fried rice, Bulgogi fried rice, and split the Bulgogi nacho fries. The nacho fries was the infused dish and it was surprisingly delicious! There were a lot of different flavors but it actually worked. Bulgogi, cheese, pico de gallo, Korean gochujang sauce. Sounds like a lot going on but I would definitely order these again!

The Bulgogi Kimchi fried rice wasn't anything special but not bad tasting. I think I could whip up better... :)

Overall I would give it a 4/5; awesome KoMex fries, and average Korean fried rice."}
{"text":"It was my first time and will be my last visit. I don't know where and how this place got 4.5 stars from yelpers. There were 8 of us dined in tonight. We got separate bill and 20% tip was added to each bill. 

My friends ordered chimichanga, burrito, kimchi fried rice, and pork sliders. I was the only one ordered pan fried fish. I asked if the they deep fried or breaded. The waitress told me they grilled the fish. What? But I'm an adventurous food lover, so I went ahead and gave it a chance anyway. What a disappointment! My dish was the last to came out. The fish fillet was cold, bland, soggy, and felt apart as soon as I touched it with the fork, so I asked for a chopsticks instead. The vegetables, mostly broccoli, with few pieces of onion, and green bell pepper were also tasteless. I couldn't tell if they were grilled or pan fried. Standard Korean sticky rice came with it, nothing special. I barely eaten my food. Most of my friends didn't finish their neither. 

I was going to get the Calypso Lemonade, but decided to skip it after how disappointed my food was. 

My advice: spend your money elsewhere. This place doesn't worth the drive up to North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Let's make this short and simple... I walked in and the young man at the door said no dine ins due to a big party that was coming. He said take out only... We agreed  this other rude man said to order on the counter but the way he said it and went about it was so demanding. He reminded me of a C.O in prison... We didn't even sit down and eat because customer service was so horrible. With that said.... Screw Komex fusion and all it's rudeass employees!"}
{"text":"Yum! Came here for a team outing and everything was delish! The portions are HUGE and the prices are great! I went there with 6 other people and our total bill, including two appetizers and beverages, was $123 including a 20% gratuity for a large group. I've been wanting to go here for a while and regret I didn't come sooner. There's a smaller one closer to my house so I'll definitely plan to go there in the very near future."}
{"text":"I love this place! My best friend and I decided to take our lunch hour and try KoMex. We ordered quite a few dishes-pork torta, Philly cheese steak, kimchi fried rice, a calamari taco, a pork belly taco and rice and beans. Everything was made quickly, and everything was delicious! The staff was very friendly, which always makes a visit pleasant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tasty and unusual, but far from healthy is a decent way to start.  This tiny restaurant combine a Korean Chef and a Mexican Chef who magically mix two cultures into one interesting flavor combination.  Everything I have tried so far has been tasty, but leaves me feeling a little greasy afterwards.  Good lunch, but get there early or you will NOT get a seat.  Definitely worth a try if your want something new and interesting.  Delicious food!"}
{"text":"i ate here about a year or two ago.  it is the only meal in vegas i remember, thats how good it was.  i love komex and will be back ASAP next time i'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed the last two times I went to eat here. I and the people that came with me felt that the food was bland and was nothing special. Wonder what happened? The food used to be pretty good here. I heard that they opened new locations. Maybe the chef they had here went to one of their new locations? Anyway, won't be returning here because the food at this place is no longer good."}
{"text":"My friend Janet and I loved our meal here. The ingredients were fresh and properly prepared The food is distinctive. And it's cheap. What's not to love?
For our meal we both got wontons and I got beef, pork and chicken tacos. We split a beef tostada.
While the chicken and pork were both good, the beef is the star here. And it was fantastic on the fusion tostada. The tostada has great, fresh toppings but instead of a corn or flour tortilla it came on something made out of rice. and the whole rice grains were still visible. I think any trip here should include a fusion tostada.
Janet tried a tofu taco since her husband is a pescetarian and she said it was quite good too. 
The only misfire for me was the mango/passionfruit iced tea. I don't get the flavors. Janet got one too and said she liked it.
Service was excellent. They were really hustling. We got there just before the lunch rush.
I would love to come back to KoMex and explore the menu."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Mexican food. I have lived in Mexico on and off for about three years. I heard about this place and was...unsure...but after my brother in law went, and absolutely raved about it, I figured I would give it a try. 

All I can say is WOW. We were in a party of four, and ordered a few appetizers, and we all kind of communally taste tested our meals. I didn't have a single thing that wasn't fabulous. 

The restaurant itself didn't look like much but this place delivered, and it delivered big. It's pretty far away from where I live, otherwise I'd eat here every week. I've been back numerous times, and referred plenty of people. Of all of the \"fusion\" food places out there, I haven't found one that beats KoMex."}
{"text":"This place saved me from the vote. My brother and husband both wanted Mexican food and I wanted Asian food. We solved our delimma by going to Komex! The place was super packed so we waited about 10 minutes . 

I had their KimChee fried rice which was really good! I was nervous about ordering it because I thought it would be too salty.  It had the perfect amount of spices though. The portions were big so I had plenty of left overs!"}
{"text":"I really didn't know what to expect from this place. The combination of Korean and Mexican didn't immediately appeal to me, but the reviews were good so I figured I should give it a try. It is up the street from Meadows Mall in the corner of a strip mall. Which made me even more leery.  On the plus side, it was pretty packed on a Wednesday night...a good sign right?

They serve house made chips, salsa, & guacamole while you wait. We ordered chicken fried rice, flautas, and a cheesesteak. Everything was pretty delicious and made to order. The service was good. The bill came to under $25 and we had enough left over for another meal.

This place is pretty small, but definitely worth checking out. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for a while I finally had a chance to stop by a while back. I came in one day with my bro and tried the Bulgogi burrito, Spam Musubi, Fish Taco and the Yelp special for some Fried Wontons. Soon the food stared to arrive but was missing the Fish Taco and the server argued that we didn't order that, but we didn't care to fight as long as it didn't show on the bill. Service was ok but kinda abrupt and semi-cheery. After trying a few other Korean Mex places I'm not sure it works for me. The sweetness of the bulgogi over powers the savory flavors in my opinion."}
{"text":"Speechless! We now have a reason to come to Vegas! This is a small hole in the wall place in a small shopping plaza. We were kind of skeptical at first just because of the restaurant itself but we were very much surprised when the food came out. The bulgogi meat tacos were made to perfection, all the ingredients tasted amazing. It was something I had never experienced before.... I was in taco heaven! We were kind of disappointed because we were not able to try their pork tacos, they apparently were waiting for their shipment.  But next time we are in town we are definetly returning to KOMEX!"}
{"text":"Not the nicest atmosphere but the food rocks!  Had the tacos.  They were all very good and very reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Tried it thanks to pics on yelp.  Got there for lunch right at noon on Sat.  Good thing cuz crowds came and they had to wait.  Bulgogi nachos were great, as were their chicken wings.  Kimchi fried rice was just okay for me but my three companions loved it.  Check for the daily specials."}
{"text":"This place is a real surprise. Would never guess from the looks of it that the food is amazing!! My favorite... the pork tostada! Everything I have had off the fusion side of the menu has been great. The Kim Chi fried rice is an absolute must at every visit. My husband loves their fusion chicken wings. Tacos for $2.... you have got to try their home made salsa. They bring a variety to the table and they are good!! Spicy, and flavor is terrific!"}
{"text":"Ewww never again. Owner is nice. But some things should just not be mixed like Mexican and Korean food."}
{"text":"Experience:  I came with some friends to try out the fusion.   I have wanted to try this place for almost a year.  Maybe sometimes that wait sets your expectations to high. It was decent, but not as good as I tasted it in my mind. 

Food: they put chips and salsa on the table that were okay, but definitely not my go to Mexican choice. 
I ordered 3 tacos which had your choice of meat...I picked the Bulgogi (Beef), Daeji bulgogi (Pork) and Pork Belly.  All there were good, but not amazing. 
My friend ordered the Kimchi fried rice.  It was a HUGE portion.  It was pretty tasty.
Another friend ordered the bulgogi nachos that I tried, which were pretty disappointing. Even he was regretful at his order. 

Service:  the service was not too great.  I had to get up and find the waitress to get a beer. She was pretty slow to take our food order too.  It was a little busy, so that might have been the issue, but this is never an excuse as the management should staff better. 

Facility:  it's pretty small, but comfortable enough for this casual cuisine. 

Overall review:  it was ok.  I would probably come back with friends, but not at my suggestion."}
{"text":"Ok honestly I had seen this place for a long time and I was always curious to check it out and I must say WOW!!! Everything was awesome from the service and staff down to the comp chips and salsa. This place is def a must try!"}
{"text":"Simple spin on two delicious cuisines. The fusion burrito with Bulgogi takes burritos to another level. When other places in town complicate a burrito with sushi. This simple substitution for carne asada blows every other burrito out of the water. I could serious eat here every single day!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were at Meadows Mall and wanted lunch but not familiar with the area. So I used my trusty Yelp app to find nearby restaurants and up popped this \"fusion\" place. I couldn't resist checking it out seeing how all of the Yelp reviews were 5-stars and people raved, so I had to try it. 

This place is one of those drive-by-and-if-you-blink-you-miss-it joints. Located in a crowded strip mall - a little hole in the wall place and definitely a well kept Vegas secret. This place is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm serious. They give you nice crispy complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole which was really yummy. I ordered a fusion burrito with tofu yum yum yum YUM!!! it has tasty fresh ingredients, Mexican Rice, Green & Brown Onions, Pico de Gallo, Cilantro, Lettuce, Asian Soy/Sesame base Sauce. Be warned though that it is enormous so either be really hungry or take the rest home like I did. It was delish the next day. 

My friend had the fusion bulgogi (beef) tacos and she said they were amazing as well. I can't wait to come back and try the nachos!!!!! 

They have that awesome bottled Mexican Pepsi and Mexican Coke, how cool is that? They also carry pineapple jarritos beverage. I drank unsweetened mango passionfruit iced tea and that was really different, very tasty. 

Fast and friendly service. And this place is CHEAP!! My entire lunch bill was $8. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Really liked this restaurant, good price, and great quality of meat. Most places use really fatty meats, not this place! We came here during lunch hour, and we were seated within 1 minute. It was a large group, but they had no trouble. The service was good they filled my water multiple times (which is important, since I drink like a camel when at restaurants). They brought out the food, fresh and hot! 
what we got:
1. Fried rice with tofu! So good, it was a half portion and $6.5 and more than I could handle
2. The Nachos--nice favor, bolgogi meat plus pico de gallo, jalapeños cheese. Would skip next time.
3. Spam musubi--large portions! Very good!
4. Bolgogi meat, rice and chicken

Will come again, would recommend it to others"}
{"text":"If I died and was declared a saint, I would like to be the Patron saint of Komex. This place is amazing. No need for a full review. Everything here is top game."}
{"text":"This review is for my 2nd visit to KoMex. We showed up on a nice drizzly day ready for some fusion! We enter, there is only 1 other table occupied and we're offered high chairs right away and sit down. Hubby and I order their passion iced tea which is DELISH! We decide on the combo fried rice and I get the fusion torta. The rice had a perfect texture and was FULL of bulgogi, pork, and chicken. There was also the other fried rice staples egg, carrot, and peas. We ate almost all of it between the 3 of us but couldn't finish it lol. The fusion torta was AWESOME it comes with bulgogi, lettuce, jalapenos, tomatoes, avocado, onions, and mayo. They put a red sauce on it that I'm not sure what it was but still awesome and wasn't spicy! This thing is HUGE it has to be about 8-9 inches long and full of bulgogi. I super appreciate they don't skimp here. It would be so easy since it's a family run, small business to take away some protein!
 

I would never think a korean, mexican, chinese fusion place would be so kid friendly but it really is! There were 3 tables with kids at one point while we were eating. For being number 3 on Vegas' top rated on yelp they live up to it by far. The only downside is not having fountain drinks! I give them 4.5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I've found a new favorite place! 

Hubby was in the mood for Mexican and suggested the usual suspects. But I wanted something new and exciting! I also wanted something casual and affordable. Based on their website, this place fit the bill. And they didn't disappoint!

We visited around 6p on a Wednesday evening. There was only one other full table when we arrived and it didn't get any busier throughout our stay. 

The front of the menu listed their specials and the loaded Tots immediately caught my eye. They also do a loaded nacho/fry which comes in small or large. But that only comes with one meat. These Tots came in one size and was loaded with THREE meats - bulgogi, bacon and pork Belly! Woah!! Need I say more? It was fantastic! Hubby and I are pigs, so we definitely could've used a bigger size portion. But it ended helping us save room so we could try a few more items. 

Hubby couldn't resist some tacos, so we went with one calamari and one pork Belly. He was pretty crazy about the former. It was definitely bigger and packed full of more food than most of these Gourmet tacos that are so popular nowadays.

Next we went for the Bulgogi Tortas. They take a patty of white rice, deep fry it and cover it with meat and vegetable goodness! The outside of the rice patty was crispy, while the inside was soft and perfectly soaked up all the juices from the meat. Apparently this dish was featured on a Food Network show. And I can see why - it is unique and delicious!

We were nearing the point of being full, but everything was so good that we just had to try one more! Because I love cheese, we chose the Bulgogi Empanadas. The cheese was melted to perfect ooey Gooey-ness. And the tortilla it was wrapped it was one of the most amazing things I've ever had! It had a very light crisp on the outside and the inside was fluffy - not over-fried and dried. 

When our waitress brought the bill, she also brought a complimentary dessert of half an orange! How refreshing. 

My one and only complaint - they advertise that if you pay with cash you get 5% off. But for some reason we didn't get it....

We can't wait to go back to this place! Those oases Tots and the empanadas need to happen again. And maybe something new like the bacon fried rice?"}
{"text":"This location is absolutely just as good as the other. It might not have all the same specials, but it at least had the important one - Tots loaded with Bulgogi, pork belly, bacon, cheese, salsa, guacamole and sour cream. That dish is my personal favorite. The Bulgogi flautas come in second. I love have fluffy and soft the tortilla stays and I appreciate the perfect amount of cheese that's inside!

Hubby's favorite is the Bulgogi Tostada. At this place, instead of everything being polled on a tortilla shell, the use a deep fried patty of rice. Yup. Pretty awesomely delicious. Hubby also usually gets a couple tacos, too - Bulgogi, calamari, fish. 

The service is very friendly and fast. Don't forget to bring cash so you get a percentage off your bill!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Served fresh and hot! The bulgogi fries are delicious, especially when accompanied by the house's homemade kim chee! I worked in Austin for years and ate at the Chilantro truck as often as I could. No contest, Komex wins hands down!"}
{"text":"I've tried another Korean-Mexican place in L.A. and had the runs, but the adventurous part of me still wanted to give this classification of cuisine another shot. I went with family and was thoroughly impressed. The tacos had the right texture and aroma with the tortilla, and the burrito was well done. Though the beef bulgogi was on the sweet side just a bit. It worked well with the burrito, but not so much the enchilada. Staff was friendly, and the toothpicks for the oranges were cute. The men's bathroom was clean, though it was intimidating seeing a poster of the godfather woke I was peeing. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Oh good lord.  I just saw on Faceook that they were trying some bulgolgi and spicy pork hot dogs.  Holy moly lamma jamma!  Listen, I didn't ask what came on them.  I just ordered two bulgolgi beef and one spicy pork.  I have a 6 year old.  Kids go apeshit for hot dogs.  Generally, though, he is anti-new flavors.  Kids are morons when it comes to tasting new and strange things.

HE LOVED IT!  SO DID I!  Caps off.

The hot dogs are on large buns and topped with all sorts of deliciousness (pico de gallo, jalapenos, bacon, asian slaw, etc.).  Two dogs is more than enough for one massive man with a lumberjack appetite.  I had two... But I'll hit the gym in a while to work off the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Its good, a hole in the wall. But slightly over-rated I think. Nice selection, but the tacos and burritos are not as good as Kogi or the other knock-off places. Usually has a long wait."}
{"text":"\"It's a good thing this place is near my work, or else it would have taken forever to take the time and effort to go here.\" That was my initial thought. Turns out, this place is very worth the time and effort to get to.

Never mind the interior design and the small parking area. The food here is good. I tried the bulgogi burrito for the first time, and I never knew it would be that tasty. A little spicy, but still it gives me a symphony of flavors. 

Although I was confused at first whether to order at the counter or sit down, I soon figured out it was a sit-down place. Doi. Go figure.

Anyway, the burrito is huge. Worth the price. They stuff it with tons of ingredients including the oh so tasty bulgogi. As I was halfway finished, the tortilla ripped apart and I was left with a pile of stuff. Delicious stuff. And I used my hand to eat it all up. You know it's good when you finish a mess with your hands.

Must go here again for more exquisite deliciousness."}
{"text":"FINALLY, I got the chance to try KoMex.  I hadn't known that they had one near my work, so I was exciiiited.  My hubs has been wanting me to try this place for the longest.  He works up North, but we live on the opposite side of town so I never agreed to going there until we were on that side of town.  Well that never came around, but here I am at their other location.  We came right when they opened and I have to say that this restaurant gets really busy.  So if you are in a rush, they even put a sign up saying that there will be a wait.  

Well I had every intention of trying one of their fusion Tacos or Burritos, but I basically had my mind set when I saw the Bulgogi plate.  I was so thankful that they brought us chips, salsa, and guacamole.  I was so hungry.  Guacamole was awesome!  On to my main dish.  

Can I tell you that I was impressed?  I would be the type to try what their best known for, but I went on a limb and just did Korean.  The bulgogi is flavored right, the fried rice is a great option to compliment your choice of protein, and if you think thats too much carbs and protein you can add on veggies which is what I did.  Oh, the hot sauce, on point!  I'm pretty sure its made there.  It has a really nice kick to it.  

I want to return and try their bulgogi fries and a burrito, however, I'll need my husband to assist on finishing their large portions.  LOL!"}
{"text":"As advertised.  A dive with pretty tasty tacos. They weren't groundbreaking or divine, however."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this place while having breakfast at Babystacks and decided to come here the day after for lunch before heading back home to CA. I ordered the bulgogi cheesesteak sandwich with fries and he ordered the pork belly burrito. Neither one of us finished our food and had to take it home. The meat serving was very generous and the quality of the food was good. I'm glad we decided to come here and we'll probably be stopping by again next time we're in town. The host was very nice you get 5% off your bill when you pay cash. This place is about 10 mins away from the strip but worth the drive."}
{"text":"W - O - W !
What can I say...Eric R. and I came for Jen S.'s UYE, and it was a grand time!
The contest: $10 for all you can eat tacos (your choice of meat and sides) and free soda, iced tea or water for 15 minutes.
The challengers: Eric R., Tiffanie R., Gabe, Jen S., and Danny.  The first four did the challenge at the same time, and Danny upon entering battled in round 2.
It was a meaty, fast-paced chewdown with flavors flying and lots of excitement.  Jen and Eric were neck-and-neck when it got to tacos 9-11, but Eric's one extra bite claimed initial victory.  Enter Danny, who inhaled 8 tacos in 7 minutes, with all looking good, but he hit a wall, and after 9, Eric R. was declared the winner. 
The prize: a KoMex t-shirt and a picture with a sign that read, \"I ate 11 tacos and one bite!\"
Tiffanie got recognized for being the only woman brave enough to try the challenge.
Otherwise, for us sane people: Lily, Jieun L., Anthony M., Tony T., and Paolo D. - oh, and me! - we ordered from the menu.  I missed out on the free check-in wontons because they have pork, but we were given 4 plates of them generously!  We also got chips, salsa, guac and 4 hot sauces.  There was one I really liked with onions and Korean spices and other herbs.
Everyone seemed to go for the lettuce wrap tacos except Paolo who ate his Torta Ahogada in record time and licked that plate clean!
I got one beef fusion taco with avocado and jalepeno, and one fusion tostada, the star of the show...a rice patty (perfection!) topped with chicken, lettuce, pico, Korean hot sauce, avocado and jalepeno.  It was so amazing I wanted another one but refrained from overstuffing myself!  I think I am now hooked and next time I am over here, it is 2 rice patty tostadas for me!
I also enjoyed the delicious mango-passionfruit iced tea.  I also noticed in the cold case KoMex carries Sweet Leaf mint and honey iced tea, the only sweet-ish tea I will drink (and it is made in AUSTIN!)
Soooo much fun and I really liked everything I tasted.  Thank goodness Jen S.  hosted this fabulous event so we could finally eat here.  We also ran into Clint B. here who was here with his family for dinner!
In this battle of man versus tacos, Eric R. won!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Blending Korean and Mexican cuisine is genius! The environment is super casual and the food is out of this world.  I went with a group of friends and we started with the Bulgogi nachos. We each ordered something different, burrito with spicy pork, tostado with bulgogi with their special komex slaw and a crispy rice patty, chicken and bulgogi tacos with corn tortillas, and bulgoi and pork belly lettuce wrap tacos. 

Everything was excellent. I wish I was a local so that I can eat here more often.

It's a rather small place and I can see that this place gets packed quickly. I would recommend this place to anyone whobwants good quality food that is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is okay if you go in with the expectation that you'll be getting fast food that you can't really buy anywhere else. As for the quality, everything was extremely greasy.

We got the fettuccine noodles, a cheesesteak sandwich, and a bulgogi plate.  Each item was greasier than the last.

We saw the reviews and were really excited to try this place but it was a let down.  The price is what makes this a three. Otherwise the food alone was probably a 2 to 2 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Thank god they opened one on the sw part of town. We love everything on the menu! We usually get the taco w kimchi on the side, and the spam fried rice."}
{"text":"This place isn't attractive at all, what-so-ever. But who the heck cares as long as the food is hella good, right? Plus, I'm no snooty booty. This was our very first time at this place. I read a lot of the Yelp reviews and decided that the good completely out weighed the bad. My boyfriend and I ordered so much that we actually had the lady, whom I think was the owner and was super nice, actually stop us mid-order just to tell us that this was a lot of food. LOL! She was soooooooo right. We ended up taking a lot of it home with us. They first came out with chips (homemade and awesome) with salsa and guac. Then they brought out our spam musubis WITH FRIED EGG :9 Then, came out our humongous burritos. Bulgogi (beef) for my bf and Duk-gogi (chicken) for me. The fusion between korean and mexican flavors was something I've never experienced before. It was genius. It had rice, our choice of meat, pico de gallo, beans and cilantro. Then came our tacos. I had pork, my bf had chicken and fish, which was fried and hardly any breading at all (such a breath of fresh air). I ate one taco and just a third of my burrito. Again, it was HUMONGOUS. So that was two burritos, four tacos, two spam musubis, a Voss water bottle, and lemonade for just $25!!! Can't beat that! And we used our check-in prize of fried wantons (also delicious!!)

Definitely going to hit this spot up again! :D"}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be sort of sweet and tangy but instead it was pretty Mexican. Its like being in Mexico City for tacos. Its really great for that. If you want to know what street food tastes like - look no further. The service was good and it was busy"}
{"text":"Yummy but greasy -- As usual, I asked for the favorite. 

It was the deep fried chimichanga.

Deep fried -- What do I expect, right..?

Hot oil.

That's what I expect.

If the oil is hot enough, the food absorbs much less of it.

Thus, though the bulgogi in the chimichanga was perfect, the chimichanga itself was very greasy. 

Don't get me wrong.. I'm being meticulous here :) 

I'd like to see Komex begin to incorporate gluten-free tortillas (I realize corn tortillas are generally an option -- But for the deep fried chimichanga, I'm not sure if it is -- I would imagine so.. but not certain).

Nonetheless, you'll enjoy Komex!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! The bulgogi tots were amazing! Loved the crunchy tots with the cheese, bacon, pork belly, and bulgogi. One bite and I was hooked! I also ordered their meat combo rice place. The meat seasoning was great and it was so good. I highly recommend this place for anyone. Extremely happy my friend referred me to this place since I was in Vegas for the weekend. The service is great as well."}
{"text":"Indeed the best fusion food I've ever had! The flavors mix so well together. Amazing! The fusion tacos and fusion nachos are a MUST!"}
{"text":"This is place was great!  I've actually had food from the grandfather of all food trucks, the Kogi truck, that helped pioneer the Korean/Mexican fusion cuisine.  This place was sooo good.  Ingredients were very fresh, marinated meats were so tasty and everything was so flavorful.  I sampled the chicken tostada, beef tacos and lettuce wraps (all fusion).  I was delighted by it all!"}
{"text":"When I want bulgogi in a burrito Komex hits the spot! It's a unique twist on a burrito, I love the quality of meat. It's a place to go to when you want something you won't find in typical burrito."}
{"text":"Otw to Komex both my boys decided to take a nap. So we had to change our plans which is fine.

My wife and I decided to order Togo and eat it at her parents house. 

First time ordering pork belly musubi but we always order kimchi fried rice, bulgogi nachos, combo fried rice, 2 orders of chicken wings and beef chowfun.

I didn't eat breakfast that day for some reason so I was starving. My wife started driving and I wanted to try the pork belly musubi. My first bite was heavenly. I'm so glad I ordered it but I should of ordered orders instead of 1. But one order came with 2 so it's plenty.  I first tasted the crispy fried smokey of the pork belly and it was out of this world.  It lasted about 8 minutes. My wife took a couple bites but I pretty much inhaled it. I'm gonna try it with egg next time.

The kimchi fried rice, chow fun, bulgogi nachos, 2orders of chicken wings, and regular fried rice for the kids is our goto order every time we go. Sometimes we mix in bulgogi tacos or sliders. But everything ever thing is good including the Chinese side of the menu. The wonton soup is excellent and chow fun. I have not been disappointed with the the food.  Even if we drove 25 minutes the bulgogi nachos were so tasty. If you ever had chilequiles, it reminded me of that with a twist.


I will be back, I have family in town so hopefully this week. My sisters first choice is always Komex and they drove 500 miles vegas! Thank you Komex.

Everything is subjective,  and I am not picky but I enjoy komex. Service is always excellent! !!"}
{"text":"If my boyfriend actually wrote the review, he'd give this place a 4/5 stars. I enjoyed it, but do I personally think its awesome? Meh...just didn't suit my tastes. It's good, but not stupendous. Will I go again? Sure, if my boyfriend wants to go the next time we're in vegas,, but I won't be going by myself.

 Pros: cheap good food, big portions, lotsa food"}
{"text":"Very happy with this place.  Tried a little bit of everything and it was all good. Kimchi fried rice was my favorite. Service was friendly and fun"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fusion mixed Korean and Mexican dishes. My favorite is the Bulgogi Beef Tater Tot hot skillet! Melted cheesy goodness inside. Topped with; sour cream, bacon, tomatoes, and green onions. Complimentary chips with salsa and guacamole are included with each dish. And their variety of hot sauces are excellent."}
{"text":"This is our all time favorite family restaurant! Delicious food!  Today  we had a Bulgogi Tostada, Bulgogi Grilled Cheese, Bulgogi Nachos, Bulgogi slider with French fries, Quesadilla and Spam Masubi!! Needless to We had to get to go boxes!  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I love discovering places like this.  KoMex is a no-frills, mom-and-pop operation that is passionate about serving up tasty food.  The real stars of the menu are their Korean fusion meals, where you can eat a blend of Korean bbq style meats with Mexican-style wrappings such as torta, burrito, chimichanga, enchilada, and taco forms.  You can have kimchi included with your meal, which I highly recommend!  My spicy Korean pork burrito was gigantic and filled to the brim with delicious tender pork, fresh pico de gallo, flavorful Mexican rice, onions, kimchi, and lettuce.  The portions here are huge, the service cheerfully excellent, prices are very reasonable, and your meal comes with 4 different salsas for you to add to your meal.  Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"KoMex is very different. For one, despite the very affordable meal, you get the sitdown restaurant treatment, menus and tables and all, when they could easily have made us fall in line food-court style for the quality they're delivering for the price-point. Even just the crisps they serve you when you first are seated are generous, considering your bill will likely over around $4-$7 per person by the end of it.

The service is very friendly, warm, but efficient, which makes this very busy and small establishment more cozy than hectic. That was unexpected, too.

More unexpected was the fact that I actually liked their tacos - the seafood was very good, not quite fantastic, but definitely good. The textures could have stood to be more sharp and firm, but it did make for a pretty nice cohesive taco. It was a little bit on the harsh side, with the combination of strong spices and strong citrus, but it's a nice tasteful kick instead of being outright offensive. Besides the tacos, the bulgogi fries were very, very good too, and the water was ice cold and frequently filled. 

I'm not a taco person by any means, but these are tacos I'll definitely eat, especially at a bargain like this, and with such a cute, welcoming, clean, but very casual set-up like this. Definitely very different."}
{"text":"BEWARE! Did takeout here today and was charged $42 for 6 tacos, full pork plate and 2 calypso lemonades and I've got the bank statement to prove it. Being new here, I did not question the price but checked the menu pricing found online a little later. What a jip. Never again."}
{"text":"My favorite comfort food along the 95 corridor.  Bulgogi street tacos with kimchi and salsa?  Yes, please!"}
{"text":"Korean/Mexican fusion? Who woulda thought of that but I'm glad someone did. Pretty good. 

My brother brought me and my gf here. He had the bulgogi nachos (huge portion), my gf had the fusion chimichanga w/pork and I had the combo flautas (all 3 meats with cheese then fried).

I tried everything and all were good even the free chips and salsa. If we make it back here I'd get the fusion chimichanga.

Service is friendly and very helpful if it's your first time."}
{"text":"This place has great food, the Mexican and Korean fusion brings great flavors.. If you like to try new things I would recommend you to visit them!"}
{"text":"Pros: This place is all about the food and it is GOOD food! I love Korean food packaged in Mexican goodness so this place hits the spot on a budget! I got their bulgogi bowl and their 3 tacos... YUM. In Vegas, this is probably the best food for it's price! The selection is pretty good and you can't go wrong with their food. The staff is very nice and attend to your needs.

Cons: It is a hole-in-the-wall kind of place so it is smaller with little emphasis on decor. The parking lot is also on the smaller side but totally worth the trouble for the food.

Overall: Yes, yes, and yes! I'm all about quantity and quality with food and this place hits the spot! Highly recommended for delicious food for a good price!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and really filling, plus well priced. The menu had korean-mexican fusion items, mexican options, and korean options. They were really quick to refill our waters and chip bowl. We could tell that they genuinely cared about our experience. Kenny was the best, so kind and informative. Plus, both the regular and the fusion guacamole were delicious!
Overall a great experience and we will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Never a let down, I look forward to Komex every time I visit Vegas. The menu is fun and vegetarian friendly. The service is wonderful, they definitely have a very family run environment. I suggest this place to all my friends coming to town."}
{"text":"Nice little place to drink and eat some very good food. They have a bar and regular seating. Mostly Mexican beer except Hite which is from Korea. Overall clean and orderly. Great service. For most of the time I was there there was only one waitress but she was flying around was a smile on her face. Food? Wonderful! I had a beef bulgogi burrito and a bulgogi taco. My buddy had chicken bulgogi with rice. Both were great but the burrito stood out. At the table next to us the lady ordered the breakfast burrito that she lived. Great place and I'll be back."}
{"text":"What can I say? This place is great!

Korean-Mexican fusion. My review will focus on two items on their menu: Pork Belly Taco and Bulgogi Burrito.

Pork Belly Taco
This dish was amazing. In no way did they skimp out on the taco itself. It was full of meat and veggies. The pork belly was deliciously succulent but not too fatty-feeling and the combination of lettuce to spices complimented the pork in the corn tortilla. perfect.

Bulgogi Burrito
Sweet, moist and succulent! yes this burrito was awesome. It had just enough sweetness from the bulgogi's marinade to accent on to the mexican rice within the burrito. Ok i'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

If you're in vegas this is a must try!

It's missing a star because it closes at 9 pm :( boo I wish it was open later!"}
{"text":"At first, I was a little skeptical if this place would as good as the original location as with most restaurants who scale. Well, it is....It is the same quality as the original. As usual, the Komex tacos were great along with the kimchi fried rice with three meats. The service is always friendly and attentive. Good job Komex!"}
{"text":"Read about this place for cheap eats os 2012 during my visit to Vegas. Place was not hard to find and so glad I made the trip out. The bulgogi nachos were amazing and the prices are really reasonable. The nachos were crisp and full of flavors. The bulgogi was so tender and juicy. The cheese was stringy and sweet. All the flavors blended together so well. Had the chicken taco which was amazing and tasted so authentic. Wish I could have one of these in my neighborhood because this would be weekly visit and definitely a drunkie's dream come true!"}
{"text":"These $1.29 tacos of love are a must try.  They have a variety of options such as asada bulgogi and pastor(pork).  I tried the bulgogi and pastor which both were devoured within 2 min.  We also ordered the wings and fries and trust me, they dont not give you those skimpy little buffalo wild wings or wingstop peices of crap.  These wings here aren't massive but the perfect size and fried to sexellent perfection.  I don't know why but something about good chicken wings always turns me on kekeke

CUSTOMER SERVICE IS GREAT HERE. BEST SERVICE EVERRRR"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but it was not meant to be. In all honesty, I think there is just better fusion food in LA where I am from. We tried the pork belly musubi (good but would be better if the pork belly was cut into smaller pieces), the kimchi fried rice (Monta's is better), and the famous bulgogi fries. I think the fries need to be crunchier because it became soggy underneath everything. All the toppings were good but it just felt like something was missing. I would also suggest getting the kimchi on the side because that made everything soggy real quick. 

All in all, not a rave-worthy place to visit..."}
{"text":"What a pleasant experience. Greeted by a very polite and friendly person. I ordered some fusion tacos(beef), and kimchi fried rice.  The only problem with the food was it is so good I find it hard to stop eating.  This is a must have food in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was craving Korean tacos and this place was recommended on Yelp, and it was more than satisfying. I ordered the beef tacos and some fusion tacos and I am so happy. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Decided to try KoMex because of all the reviews. The food was very good! Complementary salsa and chips! Salsa was delicious but the chips were thicker than I like but that's just a personal preference. I had the kim chee fried rice and my boyfriend had the wings and cheese steak. We both enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"KoMex was out of the way but it was an anticipated foodie stop on a weekend Vegas trip.  I had just read a magazine article where their Fusion Burrito was actually rated one of the very best in the entire US!  Now that's really setting a high level of expectation.

We stopped by for a midafternoon mini meal to just share a couple of items.  The Fusion Burrito with pork bulgogi was good but it didn't blow me away by any means.  Maybe I'm jaded by the numerous good burritos from SoCal. The Fusion Fries with beef bulgogi were slightly disappointing.  I didn't enjoy the fries themselves and the toppings were on the skimpy side.

The service here was very nice and friendly and that counts for a lot. 

I've had Korean fusion food in SoCal too and I thought I've had better back at home.  I highly recommend Urban Seoul in Irvine.    

I've crossed KoMex off of my Vegas Eating Bucket List and it's now on to other places!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here before multiple times and the food is really good and different. The Bulgogi fries and the flautAs are my favorites only thing bad is the wait times for food can be pretty long at times. 
Today however our food came quickly and was delicious flautAs, sliders, and a mini quesadilla. Definitely need a kids menu here though."}
{"text":"Love this place. The bulgogi bowl is awesome and so is their homemade sauce! Never had a bad experience here. Great customer service and a great kids menu!"}
{"text":"Was too busy enjoying the food to take pictures, but the bulgogi grilled cheese was amazing, so were the fusion tacos!
On top of that the prices are really affordable!"}
{"text":"we saw this place driving the ice rink.
i was like \"what is ko mex\"
it was in chinese looking writing.
thanks to yelp, i had encountered a little gem!
indeed it was.
we had the bulgogi nachos.  very inventive!
i also had the spicy pork rice tostada.  interesting!  tasted like mom's food with some mexican thrown in.
the prices are cheap cheap cheap!
a good place to eat emotionally and celebrate!"}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite Mexican fusion joint. Let me tell you! The fusion flautas are to die for!!! They are like rolled up deep-fried tacos stuffed with bulgogi meat. I could eat this every day, except I have to watch my calories. But if I had one cheat day in a week, this would be my food of choice or at least in the top 5. Try it!!!"}
{"text":"Wings, nachos, tacos, burritos, taters, and fries. Pick your enjoyment and be absorbed in a new culture of food. Portions are large and dripping with goodness. The service was great!"}
{"text":"Despite the shabby appearence, this place has some really fantasic food. I recomend trying the fusion tacos, although I have yet to get something bad from them. And be sure to get an order of wontons for only $1!

It can sometimes be busy 12-1, for the lunch crowd. But off hours get you the best service, and if you wait for the busy hours, it WILL be worth it.

I ordered beef fusion tacos on flour this visit, and they are great."}
{"text":"After wanting to try this place out for the longest time, it was a huge disappointment. I had the bulgogi fusion burrito. It was not good. Everything inside lacked flavor. It was very bland. Inside the burrito consisted of rice, bulgogi, lettuce and pico de gallo. I even tried their salsa they gave me with the burrito which didn't help with the blandness. 

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but it was disappointing. I may try giving it a second chance in the future."}
{"text":"Loved the Bulgogi Tater Tots they're amazing also tried the nachos and were very good also! We usually order out and haven't had any complaints!"}
{"text":"I had the burritos and tried their tacos. It's really good Korean bbq meats
that are paired as a burrito or taco. I think they have bowls as well.

The quality of meat matters a lot to me, and they did well in that department.
The condiments and spices were interesting and definitely enhanced the meal
even more. This place is a winner in my book."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times and the workers have always been nice. They check up on you when you're dining in. They're a pleasure to talk to when you're ordering for take out. 

The kimchi fried rice is really good! I ordered half & it was so hard to finish. I can't imagine getting the full order! Their guacamole is good too! It doesn't taste like its the prepackaged ones but fresh vegetables. Their bulgogi fries are also super good. I haven't tried a lot of things on the menu but I've heard a lot of good things so I'll have to come back & try something new!"}
{"text":"This small, but popular Korean/Mexican restaurant, is located on Decatur Blvd. The staff was very friendly and offered to take our order while we waited for a table.  Our fried wontons, 4 per serving and costing a mere $1, were good, but totally unnecessary since they were preceded by complimentary housemade chips, salsa and guacamole.  Our order of 4 barbecue tacos (2 pork, 1 chicken and a beef) came with cilantro, lettuce, onions and kimchee, the latter being optional.  Each was very good to excellent, though next time I would skip the beef in flavor (sic) of the pork or chicken"}
{"text":"This is a small mom & pop place outside of the Vegas strip. Service is great and the food is even better. We've been here a couples times now and our favorites are still the various fusion tacos. Mexican tacos with Korean meats just go so well together. If you're ever tired of eating at the endless buffets...try this place! I highly recommend it and guarantee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food at even better prices..what more can I say.  This will be My new GOTO spot in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm torn. I had high expectations for obvious reasons - rave reviews and an average of 4.5 stars - and who doesn't appreciate a good fusion menu? I want to believe that those expectations caused my less-than-awesome experience, but nevertheless, I wasn't impressed.

My friend (who is a big fan) and I shared a half order of Bulgogi Nachos, Fusion Flautas, Fusion Tamal with Bulgogi, and full order of Kimchee Fried Rice with Pork. I've heard the buzz around these fusion nachos, so I was most excited to try them. The Bulgogi: tasty, but a rather sweet marinade; nothing spectacular as Korean marinated beef goes. The chips were okay. I like that they're housemade, but our batch lacked the crunch it needed. The pico de gallo was fresh and delicious. I thought the use of Gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) as a sauce was a nice touch. Overall, just a shrug. I could do without it. I liked the crunch achieved on the fresh tortilla on the Flautas, but again, no sparks. The guacamole and gochujang sauce was interesting! The Tamal was dry and surprisingly flavorless (my friend agreed). Lastly, the Kimchee Fried Rice was flavorful and spicy! Neither of us really cared for it, but I won't deny that it was good. 

When you don't like something that is extremely popular, you find yourself having to explain your reasoning in great detail. The food is okay, borderline good. I may have enjoyed it more without the high expectations of these dishes being \"amazing.\" It's certainly not better or superior to their Mexican counterparts (I would choose carne asada nachos over bulgogi nachos every time) and as Korean cuisine, it lacks. The good stuff? The portions are generous and the price is right! I am willing to give the place another whirl though. Who doesn't believe in second chances?"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 4 star typically. Their decor needs work and their fusion food is NOT better than Kogi of Los Angeles. But their chips, guac and salsa are great and the food is good. Cheap and portions are generous. Nice people too. I would return."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees!!  Did a solo mission today to the new location of Komex.  I have had it bookmarked for almost a year and I am thrilled I finally made it there.  So let's get down to it. I got the half order of nachos and the fusion burrito with beef. Both were amazing I only ate the nachos while dining in because it was a ridiculous amount of food! Service was awesome.  Ambiance lacked luster but honestly who gives a darn with the quality of food and amazing service!! Also ask for the spice rack. 4 homemade sauces all unique and super tasty!! Please go to this locally owned joint you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try KoMex, but it turned out not really meeting my expectations. The food is great if you want either Korean or Mexican, but it wasn't that great at executing fusion flavors. Ex: the bulgogi fries were just fries, cheese, jalapenos, and not very much bulgogi. Plus, the bulgogi didn't taste too much like bulgogi and more just like beef, so then the whole dish was just carne asada fries.

The tacos were similar. The chicken was really bland and not particularly Korean, but the pork and bulgogi were better. The kimchi fried rice was well made, but that's not fusion.

Great service and prices. It was around $20 for 3 entrees."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! LIP SMACKING GOOD!!!!! This is not your standard Mexi-joint. If that's what you want they have that too but come for the Mexi-Korean fusion. My husband and I both had the chimichanga. I had the beef, which is the most popular. The taste of the Korean bbq spices in the burrito was heavenly. It was also HUGE!  Very generous portions. My husband had the spicy pork and he was so quite as he devoured his. Both of us could not finish it all. I'm so happy i have some for dinner or lunch tomorrow. Do yourself a favor and come try the fusion. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Kudos to the folks at KoMex and their fans!  This place lived up to the yelp Hype!  The GF and I dropped by on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty quiet.  We ordered a bulgogi burrito, a chicken and a pork kbbq tacos.  All did not disappoint!  Add in a free yelp check-in offer of fried wontons and a neatly presented orange wedges for dessert and I was very impressed!  Even more impressive is the fact that all of this including our drinks cost us less than $10!!!  Keep up the good work, and for you food fanatics...support this joint!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Plus quick and inexpensive. We had fusion nachos, fusion burrito and bulgogi Philly cheese. All super delicious and fresh, fresh, fresh. Also appreciate that when we came in talking amongst ourselves about how quickly we had to get in and out (trying to decide carryout vs dine in), owner was quick to assure us they could meet our timeline. And they did!"}
{"text":"I always get kimchi fried rice from here and it's fabulous. Sometimes I get their pork belly tacos and they are super good."}
{"text":"Excellent costumer service combined with excellent,  fresh food. Love this place. Perfect for dine in or to go."}
{"text":"We had the kim chi fried rice with beef and loaded fries with chicken. Both were excellent  we plan to to return to try more things"}
{"text":"If you want it hotter, just ask!  Their Kimchee rocks"}
{"text":"Komex is one of those places where a little goes a long way.  $10 gets you a lot of food, and the food is good.  The food is also consistent, with this location serving the same dishes with the same flavors as the original spot.

I've stuck with their fusion offerings, since fusion is in the restaurant name.  The tacos, tostadas, and flautas are my go to dishes.  Taking this style of food and using Korean style meats works out quite well, with the pork being my favorite meat.  Service is friendly and food has always been fresh.  With the larger restaurant space, this location is a great place to stop by for a quick lunch or small dinner at a good price."}
{"text":"Fusion Mexican and Korean? Yes please. Everything was amazing!!! The tostada, tarot toys, chimichanga....amazing. Bulgogi beef for miles! 

The shrimp taco was good, but didn't compare.

Very strip mall so don't expect fancy, but come for the food!"}
{"text":"We originally planned to go to the other location but that one is closed on Sundays. Good thing we came to this location because they have special bar menu items that are not available at the other one. Let's just say the bulgogi burrito and grilled cheese are two MUST tries. I'm sure everything with beef in it will be good since they marinate their bulgogi very well. We tried the chicken with quesataco and it was good but nothing special. Chicken is tender and the flavor is average, however this is probably one of the healthier tasting item we ordered. We also tried bulgogi half fries and half nachos. I personally don't think getting the nacho was a good idea because they give you free chips so if you really wanted to you could just mix that in with the fries. But overall that dish was okay. The flavoring wasn't as good as the rest of items we tried and it probably will never order this again now that I know what it taste like. There are still some items on the menu that we would love to try but didn't get a chance to. Definitely will be back again next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"This isn't a full review! This is a pre-review based off of a short encounter. The pre-review will cover my experience today, when I dropped off my donation for \"Yelp's Toys for Tater Tots Drive!\"

Ok, so I dropped off my toy around 3pm today. As I entered, I stood at the counter for maybe 30 seconds before I was greeted by the hostess. I inquired about where to leave the toy that I brought. The young lady didn't know. She said to ask a man that had just finished eating at a table.

As the man approached, the lady asked him about the Toy Drive. He kindly pointed out a box that was on the top of a table (or something similar). He then said, \"You get a tot too.\" I did know that I was suppose to get a tot but he was very friendly with reminding me. So, he yelled to the back for someone to make the tot. He asked me to have a seat and he quoted me 5-6 minutes in waiting time.

After maybe 5 minutes, he bought out the bag, containing the tot. He gracefully thanked me and vice versa. I then walked out, got in my car and pulled off, without even checking the food.

I had my friend with me, so she actually wanted to opened my container of tots, because everyone knows that tots or any potato is best hot. As she busted through the bag, we were overtaken by an incredible aroma. I've never smelled, or tasted, for that matter, any tots that smelled as wonderfully as these did.

She finally opened the container and we were both surprised to see that the tots were covered with a combination of ground beef, bacon, peppers and cheese. I don't know if they were suppose to come that way, but we were certainly glad they did.

We both took a few bites and it was absolutely delicious. The spicy mixed perfectly with the meat and they all complemented the tots to perfection. The whole dish was seasoned JUST RIGHT! We were fighting over who got the last bite, it was so good!

I don't know if the man (potentially the owner) realized he had just earned himself a loyal, satisfied customer, or not. But, he surely did! And just to think, we probably would not have known anything about this place, if it wasn't for the toy drive. My friend and I have already added this place to our short list of favorites. We're definitely looking forward to going back in the near future."}
{"text":"bulgogi tacos are the best. yes! better than kogi truck

*on a side note: didn't like the daegi gogi burrito
**extra note: they serve both coca cola and pepsi in a bottle"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful from start to finish. When I walked in I was greeted with a warm smile and was told I could sit wherever. I was the only person there so I grabbed a seat in front of the TV. It was 5:58pm and the nice lady quickly grabbed me a beer so I could get the happy hour price that ended at 6pm. How cool is that?

I loved the chips, salsa and guac I was brought. Everything was fresh. I ordered the beef fusion burrito. I'm not a fan of lettuce in burritos (gets too soggy) so I asked for Korean slaw instead and it was wonderful. It kept a nice crunch. All the flavors combined, sweet Korean flavored meat and spice from the rice, was amazing. I couldn't even finish half the burrito. I ordered the kimchi fried rice to-go. I'm way too full to eat it. It looks and smells amazing. That will be my meal tomorrow for sure. Yum!"}
{"text":"I know people go to Vegas for the extravagant buffets, but sometimes I just crave for something different. It may be located a little off the strip and in a not so fancy shmancy area, but the food is delicious and cheap!

I have to comment on the pulled pork sliders because I know it may be a simple dish, but on a sweet and toasted Hawaiian bun?? I may sound silly, but it makes a difference! LOL The Korean tacos are also yummy and piled high. It really amazes me how I can eat Korean, Mexican, Chinese, & American food in one place (by one or two cooks) and have each of those dishes taste amazing! So glad my friend brought me here because I'm definitely coming back on my next visit to LV."}
{"text":"The beef tacos are so yummy! The chicken skewers are awesome with a little heat! Don't forget the free in house made chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Komex since I read such great reviews on here, and finally I made the leap.  We ordered the full order of combo fried rice, a small cheese quesadilla, a burrito with chicken, and a bulgogi chimichanga at the chefs recommendation.  The chimichanga was mouth watering, so good that the burrito seemed flavorless!   The fried rice was also surprisingly good, my daughter ate it like it was the best meal she'd ever had.  The quesadilla was cooked just right with tasty cheese, but the burrito is where the meal fell short.  It was the first of our order brought to the table, and wasn't hot inside as I expect food to be, but reheated the next day was a nice left over meal!

I will def be frequenting Komex, and the chimichanga will be a staple!"}
{"text":"A great place to check out if you happen to be simultaneously craving Korean food and Mexican food. It's a small restaurant with decent fusion menu items. Came here the other night about 30 minutes until closing so I was a bit nervous about how we'd be treated and the quality of the food. Once we arrived,  however, we were welcomed with all smiles and my worries were gone. The service was awesome. Our orders were taken and brought out in promptly fashion. 

We ordered two plates of Kimchi Fried Rice (spam and beef bulgogi) and being a such a sucker for kimchi anything, I loved both. I prefer a little more of a spice factor, but it was still delicious. I also had the Fushion Tacos; one beef bulgogi and one pork belly, which were also quite tasty. The meats were well-seasoned (not too sweet or salty) and cooked to perfection. They were also very generous in filling the tacos. Whoop! Regardless of being close to closing time, all of our dishes were made fresh, which definitely made our experience with the food so enjoyable. I'd recommend any of their fusion items and most definitely the kimchi fried rice! Yumm.

If you're in the area and looking for tasty Korean-Mexican fusion with good service, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Yelp comes through again I feel like I hit the jackpot finding out about Komex. I was hungry and on the strip but I didnt feel like spending a arm and a leg for just a meh meal. Came accross this gem and decided to make the trek. Its pretty far from the strip it was ten miles and about a 15 minute drive.

Sunday afternoon at 1:00 pm and it was pretty dead. Our server was really nice helpful and patient with us gave us good advice as far as what to order.

We went with there carne asada mexican burrito, the bulgolgi cheestake and a single bulgolgi flauta. My girlfriend loved her burrito being a san diego native and so close to the border she knows her mexican food. Not traditional but it was executed really well portions were great as to amounts of ingredients as well as overall size.

I loved my bulgolgi Philly cheese steak. It was really messy fork and knive were necessary.  I would definitely recommen it if your a fan of Philly cheese steaks. Fries sucked in my opinion soggy and lifeless. But that just made me fill up on there other awesomenss. I almost forgot while we were waiting they brought us some great guacamole and chips for free too. The flauta was good a little fluffier than im used to but still really enjoyable. 

Im lucky this place is a state away.  If it was any closer it would be bad for my waistline.  Worth the drive from the strip. Ill be back next time im in town."}

{"text":"Extremely generous portioned and decently priced little spot for korean-mexican fusion food. They offer 5% off your bill if you pay cash. The food is made to order, but the wait isn't long at all. 
It's a perfect place for cheese lovers, because a lot of the dishes are dripping with cheese that even I.. someone who doesn't eat dairy.. was drooling at the food. 
I got the kimchi fried rice, which was amazing. We also got the perfectly toasted beef grilled cheese which was so gooey and delicious.
It's a small drive from the strip, but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Fuckin delicious! Great prices for the portions and the food was exactly what we needed....meat and carbs."}
{"text":"Really good food mixing Mexican and Korean food style together! Gotta try the lettuce pork belly wrap!! Really affordable and the service was great considering there was only 2 people working"}
{"text":"Glad this place was close by, I had the bulgogi cheese steak and a calamari taco. It was more than enough, the food was delicious and fresh. I liked the family vibe and the hard working owner being around. If you like a casual atmosphere, good service and great food, make sure to come here."}
{"text":"Awesome place off the strip!! Found this place on yelp & wanted to venture off to try something fun & different, not the usual strip food. Service was friendly, food was tasty & unique. Started off with some chips & salsa, good salsa, nice and spicy!  I had veggie tacos with kimchi, delish! My hubby had the burrito with kimchi and the beef, very big burrito! Really enjoyed this place, would go back, and cheap!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great customer service and speed in delivering items. They did a great job making recommendations based on my food allergies (celiac disease-no gluten!) I ordered tacos in lettuce cups and they were delicious. My favorite were the beef tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Like most places in Vegas, KoMex is in a random little strip mall. We ordered the tacos, bulgogi burrito, and fettuccine chow mein. All of them were good, but nothing blew my mind. 

The tacos were probably my first choice of what I would order if I were to go back.
The burrito second. It was good, but the bulgogi wasn't as flavorful and wasn't nearly as saucy as I was expecting.
The noodles (to me) were the most disappointing, so we took these to go after our meal. I personally thought these tasted better as leftovers.

I do like the complimentary chips & salsa (though this is purely mexican and not korean at all)

KoMex has a great concept going, but I believe that their large menu leaves a lot of room for improvement. I'd like to see them narrow down the items they offer, and improve on those."}
{"text":"it's now my favorite cheap food place in las vegas! 
This is the perfect korean mexican fusion place. 
I always get the bulgogi bowl. It comes with rice, veggies, kimchi, lots of bulgogi and a special chili pepper sauce with mmm egg and sesame oil on top. The portions are huge so you can always have yummy left overs. 
The wonton soup is super yummy here too but that is the only thing they say they put MSG on. But it is still super delicious. 
The best part is they offer FREE chips with guac and salsa! They always have great service too! 
this place is about 5 miles off the strip but if you want affordable and large portions, go here!"}
{"text":"Man oh man. This place is amazing. If anyone is looking for some Asian fusion this place will hit the spot. I came in here around 9. It was pretty quiet and  we got seated immediately and ordered right away. Here's the stuff we ordered;
Bulgogi tator tots: with bacon bits, sour cream, tomatoes, green onions, and topped with delicious melted cheese. 5/5. This was a special on one of the menus so look/ask for it because it's a must have! 

Kimchi fried rice: with pork belly and topped with a yolky egg. The best kimchi fried rice I've had in Vegas. So flavorful and the kimchi was perfect. Some places don't have good kimchi.. But man, it was on point. 5/5

Korean chicken wings: bold flavor and sweet and tangy at the same time. They were really delicious as well, but I've had better Korean wings at some other joints. 4/5. 

Service was amazing as well! Water was never empty. The owner even came out to make sure everything was okay. At the end our server also boxed our leftover food for us. (they serve huge portions here) 
I will definitely be coming back. I want to try those tacos so bad!"}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick dinner at Komex before a show around 6pm on a Tuesday. Surprisingly we were the only ones eating while we were there. The comp tortilla chips were freshly made and we ordered a variety of their fusion bulgogi Beef & chicken tacos while my wife also had  calamari & shrimp lettuce wrap.  You can taste the High quality ingredients used but adding their sweet sauce on the tacos made everything taste much more amazing. Depending on meat choice prices range $2-3 per taco, we wanted to stay and order more but we will definitely plan to return when in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Korean fusion with Mexican. What the! But wow, it's pulled off nicely. My wife and I split the meals and had a lot left over, big portions at good prices. The service was pleasant and attentive, the restaurant is small, basic, but clean. But onto the food: 
The chips were delish! Not your basic thin chips. And they include guacamole at no cost. 
There are three menus, Korean, Mexican, and Fusion.
Fusion flautas with bulgogi meat. Heavenly. Three large flautas and seasoned guacamole & sour cream side. 
Fusion Burrito. Good, not knock your socks off, but good. I'll just eat more flautas. 
Bulgogi fries.....Yummy! More like nachos but with fries and Komex goodness. 
All this, and a coke for $25. We'll be back. Oh yes, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I didn't get to tryout their other dishes. Especially their main entrees BUT I can tell you if you want a fusion and you love Korean BBQ you can't go wrong with the Bulgogi fries! It's a shame I live in California and that it was my first time going to Las Vegas. Hopefully I go again soon, I can tell you I'll be more excited to try this place again (:!"}
{"text":"Had komex for dinner tonight and it was pretty good! The waitress was very nice!! She was the only one I saw working and she handled everything like a pro! Food had a lot of flavor and prices were reasonable!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch today and it was outstanding.  We had the wontons, the sliders and a fusion chimichanga, all were great.  The server behind the counter was very nice and helpful.  Try the bottle of ghost pepper sauce they have available, it will kick things up a notch.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Being Korean and loving Mexican food... I of course had to try this place.  Also the great Yelp reviews helped.

I wasn't disappointed.  Wow!  This is one of those places where you wish they had a location near your home.  Unfortunately, it's only in Vegas.    

So if you're in Vegas you have to make a trip to try this mom and pop shop with the yummiest pul go gi burrito.  Awesome..  yummmy spicy  korean pork nachos... that's right you heard me... spicy korean nachos.  I know.. I originally though.. uh-huh cheese and korean pork... doesn't go together..  WRONG!  it's ono licious!  lick your fingers. yummy!

It's not the easiest place to find if you're going by strict GPS directions.. once you get really close 500 feet.. you have to use your eyes to find the place.

The only mild negative is that, BECAUSE it's made to order... you have to wait.  We waited 20 minutes, but it was worth it.    The food is hot and fresh, like mom or grandma would have made in their kitchen.

If you like spicy and sweet... with some teriyaki style flavors... this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"The place might look like a hole in the wall from the outside, but the food was worth the trip. We had the fusion burrito with bulgogi and the fusion nachos and both were delicious. Service was excellent and the food was pretty reasonably priced. We'll definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Komex is great; great food, great people, great prices, good location...I am always happy I chose to put their food in my belly and my money in their till. 

Their menu is just the right size; big enough you can try a few different things, although why would you do that, Bulgogi Tacos are where it's at, and ---oh, you're gluten free? Well those come in lettuce wraps. And your friend is a pescatarian? Well we can do those with shrimp? Both of those people are in your same group? No worries, is there anything else we can get for you?

The owners are amazingly kind, and I've run into them a few times without realizing. Food in the restaurant is as awesome as takeout, as long as you don't wait forever to eat your takeout. This is the sort of local gem that everyone secretly hopes gets discovered so the owners can have a million billion dollars and hopes never ever gets discovered so it never changes. 

Komex soars in the intersection of the cuisines; spice and texture. The korean slaw, crisp and salty and vinegary, playing off against the beefy spiciness of the bulgogi, and the spice of the korea-mexican red...stuff. We'll call it salsa. All in a taco shell or lettuce cup while the juice spills down your fingers...Get the fusion stuff, and step up your usual spice level, and you'll get what the \"deal\" is. 

Pros;
- Great food, people, prices, and locale.
- Easy parking.
- Open pretty darn late.
- Easy takeout.
- They really make it easy for you to give them your money. Never any complaints about splitting checks, half cash half card, debit cards.

Cons;
- Con....con...con...The chimichanga was my least favorite of the things I ate there? It got pretty soggy halfway through. But I'm pretty sure that's inherent to chimichangas.
- This is sort of my Yelp mantra, but Know What You're In For. If you order All the Wrong Things you will have a pretty \"meh\" experience."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious!! Some coworkers and I went for lunch and we learned the hard way that we need to call ahead. We were late from lunch but the food was so good and it was so worth it!! We had the bulgogi tater tots (delish), cheesesteak (yum), & 2 rice bowls, 1 chicken and the other 3 meat. Friendly service and you can definitely taste the quality in their food!! Fusion at its finest!"}
{"text":"I would have taken a photo but i didn't have time because it looked so delicious i dove right in, and didn't come up for air til it was done!!  I had the tostada with crispy rice and my husband had the tater tots, which were yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"You come across a place called \"KoMex fusion\"....Dazed? Confused? Mystified? Let me clear this up for you, KoMex fusion is Korean, Mexican, Chinese and American food all smashed together. Not clear enough? Well, then it is what everyone says it is, freakin awesome. It's quite a trek from the strip, so be prepared to hop on the freeway, but trust me, you will save much more money on food so the extra gas will be more than paid for. My family of four tried many different dishes, we all ordered drinks and our bill was $20. I'm not even joking. The problems with KoMex is that it is not in the best area and it is super small. There is often a line out the door. I suggest you go at off times, try everything and tip heavy (they work their butts off here)."}
{"text":"WOW, the fried rice is delicious!  A bit oily, but so tasty.  Chips and guac while you wait?  I'm in heaven!"}
{"text":"this place is a hidden jewel in vegas! i kid you not. great fusion of korean and mexican foods. had the nachos and sliders and portions are amazing for its price. i actually wonder of they make profit when i see the portion of korean meat since it's expensive. anyhow, service was great and owner was really nice. wish they have one in cali!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious! Fresh and fast. We ordered the 3 meat plate, a burrito, and our favorite is the hash brown fusion plate. I recommend for everyone to try those."}
{"text":"I come here when I crave Korean but can't afford to spend time in Chinatown.  Bulgogi torta!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Super cool fusions... Friendly staff and I need to try everything on these menus... I'm Korean and my girl is Mexican so it's hella cool. ;)"}
{"text":"Well, if the Yelp reviews of this place are anything to sniff at, I knew that a treat was sure to follow after reading the mouth-watering descriptions of the Mexican/Korean fusion. Normally, I'm not sure this sounds like such a good combination, but somehow they pull it off. Boy do they ever!

I ordered the Bulgogi fusion beef burrito and fusion chicken Bulgogi tacos. Both were excellent, but the chicken tacos were unreal once you sprinkle it with some hot sauce. The spices they put on the meat just make it explode in your mouth. Each taco is small, so order three or four. You won't regret it!

The order was served with free chips salsa and guacamole. If you check-in with the Yelp! mobile app, you'll get four handmade (on site!) wontons on the house. A small orange for desert and a couple of fortune cookies and you're on your way. Despite not being busy, the order took a while to fill, but is totally worth the wait.

Certifiable mouth explosions!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing! My family went to try Komex last weekend because we love Mexican food, and we love Korean food. We heard about it from Las Vegas Weekly magazine. We tried the Bulgogi rice, bulgogi nachos, and the teriyaki chicken. The Korean flavors are the best! They have a Korean spicy sauce that is to die for! Not spicy! Just perfect. The only complaint would be the service. For a first timer it is a little confusing because you really don't know if you need to seat yourself or if there is a waitress. Well, we just sat down ourselves and a waitress did show up. It was busy so I understand...The food outweighs any problem with service. I would recommend this to anyone who wants good food!"}
{"text":"Be sure to wear a burglar's mask, because once you see the bill, you will feel like you're robbing the place.

Everything is good. The shrimp and fish tacos are GREAT.

Three things I haven't seen mentioned:

First, the absolutely amazing wonton appetizer! It's a buck for four of them with more meat than you've ever seen in a regular ol' wanton. Unbelievably good. Seriously. Whatever combo of meat, spices, and onions they're using is fandamntastic! It's served with Thai sweet chili sauce and a little dab of the chipotle style salsa on top just takes it straight to the stratosphere!

Get one order per person or you'll end up screaming \"MINES!!!!  MY PRECIOUSSSSS! Yous wants to takes it from me!\" at your dining companions.

Next, Mr. B's Ghetto Ramen. Here's a big bowl of ramen noodles with some egg, onions, and a cut up hot dog in it. It's not a hot dog, though. It's an Asian mildly spicy sausage. My son ordered it and it was too spicy for him, so I took a stab at it after stuffing my face with three tacos.

could
not
stop
eating
it.

Lastly, their iced tea rocks. I was pleasantly surprised to see Stevia in the Raw offered as their non-sugar sweetener.


The lady who owns the place is an absolute sweetheart! She's asking everyone where they live so they can consider another location. You will feel good supporting this family business."}
{"text":"Saw this on Taco Trip on the cooking channel. It was everything and more they said it was. We the the Torta with beef, pork tostada, and Bulgogi tater tots. So good!  Service was quick for lunch and the right price.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Never had korean Mexican fusion before and this was definitely a pleasant surprise.  We ordered the bulgugi rice bowl, Kimchi fried rice, beef fried rice and bulgugi slider.  All tasted awesome.  I really liked the rice bowl, lots of veggies and kimchi, the flavor was well complemented by the jalapeños.  The kimchi fried was great too.  The rice had enough moist but not soggy,  kimchi was just right aged too.  My kids finished the slider and fried rice so quickly, I didn't even get a chance to try or snap a photo.  Given they finished so quickly, .Just be delicious too!"}
{"text":"I love Komex. I recently tried a place with the same concept in Atlanta and was highly disappointed. Komex has set my Korean fusion standard pretty high I guess. The bulgogi nachos are amazing. I definitely  recommend."}
{"text":"Food is fine, but very limited menu. Service is quick and staff is friendly. Though the cafe is too far from the strip, not very convenient."}
{"text":"After getting to Vegas, my boyfriend and I wanted to get lunch at a place that was not on the strip and that wasn't too expensive but had great food! Komex was the place! Being from California, we are obsessed with Mexican. We were intrigued by the fusion of foods they had to offer. We only order the half fusion nachos/half fusion fries plate, but they did not disappoint! The flavors were unlike anything we have ever had! The chips were similar to wontons and the beef had a delicious sweet sauce that it had been cooked in!! That mixed with the cheese, sauce and fried goodness led us to leaving full and happy from one $8 plate! This is a great place to try if you want something new and exciting!"}
{"text":"Interesting place. I'm still trying to understand the fusion part. My friend ordered a fusion quesadilla. The quesadilla came with chicken and cheese. I asked how that is fusion and the server acted like he couldn't understand the question... nah, you get the question and the answer-- it's not fusion. It took a while to get my \"fusion wings\" and I'm confident they were just wings will spicy sauce."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually order bulgogi fusion taco or chicken taco. Their bulgogi fries is the bomb. The reason I gave four instead of five is they are little stingy on their kimichi. Last time I ordered 6 taco and they only gave us tiney little cup of it."}
{"text":"My man and I were craving pupusas one day and I remembered while dropping off some dry cleaning that I saw a place next door.. Esmerelda's I think??? Well \"Esmerelda's\" is no longer there and Komex is and we could't be any more pleased. We had been wanting to try Komex for awhile but never found ourselves in the neighborhood of their original location... 

The interior is nothing special.. comparable to an upgraded Roberto's.. but the food mmm mmmm mmmm,,, There is now no reason to go to LA to get good Korean fusion tacos/burritos.. We ordered take out and as we took our first bite we knew that Komex was a winner... We ordered the bulgogi burrito with kimchi, kimchi fried rice with chicken and 3 different fusion tacos. Well, we halved the burrito, barely made a dent in the fried rice and couldn't even touch the tacos so that tells you a lil something something about the portions... The food was soooooo yumm and we will definitely be going back...

HOT TIP: get extra hot sauce... I believe it's made in-house and if you love garlic then you will LOVEEEE their hot sauce.. mmmm mmm MMM"}
{"text":"I'm here anytime 'm in Las Vegas.  Excellent stuff here -- good as the korean tacos out in SoCal.
The tacos and the Bulgogi fries are highlights, but the burrito with Kimchi is awesome too.
Weird thing:  You have to request Kimchi on anything if you want it.  You do."}
{"text":"Komex is awsome guys! 
Definately a hole in the wall place but once u step inside u see why it's followers are always coming by. The food is fresh from the smallest detail and the service is beyond expectations! The staff is awsome, they have a wide variety of fusion foods that are awsome, I personally am a huge fan of they're tater tots and teriyaki chicken, u get chips and salsa for the wait and when ur food comes it's a sight to see!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Friendly and great food. Found this place on Yelp and was not disappointed. Beware that the portions are large. Hubby and I split the won ton soup, fried rice and we each tried a taco. So so good. Left lots on table. They also serve a small basket of chips and salsa with the meals. Make sure they explain the homemade Korean sauces. Made the food pop. I'll be craving it for sure"}
{"text":"Dammit, I really really wanted to like this place, and I still do want to, but it just didn't hit the mark for me. 

The restaurant is clean and neat, and the service was good. We were the only table in the entire restaurant for a good while before a few other tables shuffled in. We ordered the enchiladas with beef, pork AND chicken, a spicy pork burrito, beef bulgogi flautas, and kim chi fried rice. Everything was JUST okay, but I didn't get the fusion part at all. Other than the fried rice, everything tasted just plain Mexican to me, and not exceptional Mexican either. I didn't get the Korean fusion in any of our dishes at all.  In addition, all of the meat in the enchiladas tasted the same. I couldn't tell the difference between the pork and chicken at all, not even by looking at it. 

The kimchi fried rice was the best out of everything we ordered. It was flavorful with a hint of kimchi and the fried egg on top was a great touch. 

Sadly, the meal was extremely forgettable and I probably won't be returning. :("}
{"text":"Never had anything like this or maybe have but when I say never is because I love it. The flavors are so good. I got the nachos & the chips are perfect. The flavor & fresh flavor. I want to try the fried rice & kimichi."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!  What an experience here?  I was finally in the vicinity of Komex so I took that family to try out this place. I told them I was going to Dairy Queen....  Yeah right, who would go to DQ for frozen foods that are reheated.....

1.  Why here?  Have no idea why this place is located on the north side of the 95 and Durango in a small strip mall however, it is very crowded.

2.  Groups - Most of the tables are wide enough to squeeze in five not so huge people, and they have two areas where seating for about 6 is very comfortable. However, possibly about 40 people can be in this place so it time your visit well.

3.  Food - Absolutely creative and amazing. If you are fond of Korean food, this is really cool.

Tofu Taco with Kim Chee - Nice tasting, flavorful and a bit of spice.

Bulgogi Taco - If you like the spicy salty sweet taste of Bulgogi, in a taco it really is nice.  I really liked all the kim chee on it, the chili paste, and the small round taco that is perfect to hold and eat.

KimChee Fried Rice - This is a truly great dish. I am a BimBimBap person myself, and so this was a unique dish full of flavor and very red overall due to the Kim Chee.  We brought some home as leftovers. It was great.

Bulgogi Slider Burger - My  son had this and he really liked it. He was quiet for a while as he scarfed this down.

Mongolian Beef with Rice - Could not decide if this was better tasting than the Kim Chee Fried Rice.

Teriyaki Chicken - Yeah, I know yet I have young ones and well, they like the more traditional stuff.  They do like Bulgogi and Kalbi and all the meats, however, sometimes you gotta get the Macaroni Cheese of Asian food... It was good.

Port Won Ton Fried - 8 per serving. Tasty and what a good deal. 

4.  Price - What an inexpensive place. Very nice on the budget.

5.  Soda's a great variety of drinks all seemingly purchased at Costo and sold. You can pick it yourself out of the fridge and they will add it to your bill.  I did ask for water, and they take bottled water out of the fridge and so, I did not check my bill to see if this was paid or free.  I prefer fountain soda in larger cups however, I was here for the food.

I like this place and will try it again for sure.  I think, that I am a real lover of the traditional Korean Style food, and I do like this place overall.

GK says, if you are in the neighborhood, check it out."}
{"text":"This place is about 20 mins north of the strip, deep in Vegas. I have been dying to try this place for so long and I finally made it on my last trip. When I arrived at the little plaza that this place is located at, there were cops everywhere, and two guys lying face down on the sidewalk but gdammit I wanted some KoMex, I wasn't gonna let whatever was going on there stop me.
I looked over the pics and reviews on Yelp before walking in and ordering (my usual routine before going to a place I don't know). I ended up getting a beef bulgogi burrito and a pork belly musubi. Portions are huge, the burrito could easily serve two people.
Maybe I expected too much b/c of all the hype but my beef bulgogi burrito was just ok, very bland. The pork belly musubi was good though..but how can you go wrong with deep fried pork? I would come here again just for the pork belly musubi. Hopefully the rest of their menu is better so I can update to 4-5 stars next time I go."}
{"text":"Went there for a friends birthday. I ordered the bulgogi nachos/fries combo and fusion wings, my wife ordered the bulgogi burrito. The nachos was by far..... the best! Everything else was okay. The fusion wings seemed to have been tossed in a deep fryer (plain, no seasoning) and simply rolled in their special sauce... nothing special. The bulgogi burrito, just a normal burrito with korean beef.... again, nothing special. And the bulgogi fries.... just get the nachos instead. All in all, if you're expecting to be punched in the mouth with a whole bunch of \"fusion\" flavor, this is not the place for you. But if you simply want a decent affordable meal, komex is the place. Would I eat here again? Only for another birthday dinner or IF I were in the area."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp we found a decent place to eat in Vegas.
Fresh, delicious and cheap.  Good food, although the service is a little slow, but the sign already warned us it could be slow.  The food was good.  Not over salted or too greasy.  Excellent fusion tacos, we had the beef and pork.  Both my kids liked their tacos.  Enjoyed the Kimchi fried rice with eggs, portion large enough to feed a family of four.  Excellent combination of flavors and spices."}
{"text":"This place serves heaven on a plate!!!!  The food is so good and fresh.  It's such a small hole in the wall restaurant but that's what I love about it.  It's still a nice and humble establishment.  It's always been very clean every time I went and the staff is always really pleasant.  Just wish this restaurant wasn't so far away from me in the Southwest area because if it were closer i'd be there EVERY day for lunch AND dinner hahaha.

I tell everyone I know about this place because it's so worth going to."}
{"text":"My American Dollars go a loooong way at KoMex!  I fed a table of three for just about $20 and the great thing about it was we were all full to our bellies!   The fusion of korean and mexican food is done right at KoMex.  Korean BBQ, salsa and corn tortillas make a good combo especially at the going rate of $1+ each.  Throw it down with the killer Bulgogi Fries, which is a mother-load of marinated bbq, salsa and cheese on top of a bed of fries.  Be sure to try out all the sauces on their sauce caddy.  The mix of korean and mexican salsa makes a great addition to such classy grub! Kimchi I'm out!  ...oh but don't forget, location is a lil' north townish, so lock yo doors!"}
{"text":"Delicious. They were so busy, I felt rushed to give my order but not knowing what to order, ordered tacos.  Wonderful!  Next time I'll try to be s little more adventurous."}
{"text":"Ventured far off the strip for Komex, which is fusion Korean and Mexican as the name indicates. The vibe is super casual and accommodates large groups. 

I thought the food was pretty mediocre but appreciated the large portion sizes. My favorite fusion burrito is still Senor Sisig (Filipino style) in SF."}
{"text":"I wish they didn't close so early! Lol the portions here are huge for the price! The chow fettuccini are my hubby's favorite. The fusion nachos are really good as well. It's a small little place and it gets really full sometimes but we've never had a bad service so overall this place rocks."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK for me. Komex is generally a spot I visit when I specifically have the craving, but I feel like the quality has gone down significantly since they opened. The last 3 times I visited, the meat was bland and chewy. I also use to love the kim chi fried rice because it wasn't overly sour like some other places. The last 2 times I ordered it, it tasted bland and old. Even prior to those past visits, I still would've rated this place 3 stars.   

So what's up with the 2 stars? Well, we stopped in last week and tried to use Samsung Pay. I get it, it's still new so people are not familiar with it. The problem came when the owner refused to try it and began arguing with my boyfriend. I get that you don't want to use it, totally fine, but why put up such an argument. He could've just said no and asked for another form of payment rather than immediately making an issue out of it. I've always has such a pleasant experience with the owners in the past that this reaction was extremely off putting. Needless to say, we wont be back."}
{"text":"Yelp steers us well to a great off the strip find - news at 11!

But seriously, I rented a car on this visit to town so we could partake in some off-strip dining a la Yelp recommendations.  Being a lover of Korean & Korean fusion this was a must-try, and I was not disappointed.

They give you A TON of food here.  My honey and I are big folks and big eaters but we agreed afterwards we both should have ordered half orders of our dishes.  He got the bulgogi nachos and I got the bulgogi fried rice.  I ate less than half of mine and was stuffed.  He ate about half of his.  This is a GREAT place to feed a family on a budget!  Alas we didn't have the whole family so we had leftovers.  GET THE HALF ORDER unless you are sharing - you have been warned.

I love their chips.  They alone are worth a visit.  And, they serve them with guacamole which is a huge plus.  

I would have preferred bigger slices of bulgogi in the rice, it was actually a bit difficult to tell it was bulgogi fried rice vs. some other fried rice, until I put the sweet chili sauce on top which gave it a more distinctly Korean flavor.  The bulgogi nachos had a bit bigger chunks on them, and they were good too - surprisingly a totally different flavor profile than our local DFW korean fusion place's version of korean nachos.

The server was very nice, but seemed overwhelmed by the lunch crowd that piled in right after we did.  It's not fast food so don't come when you're in a hurry, but do go.  It's different and it's good and it's a bargain."}
{"text":"I honestly hate Mexican food but the mix of Korean and mexican food it was honestly amazing. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually order Fusion chicken taco and Beef Bulgogi plate with Korean hot sauce. So good!!! I've been to the other location in the ghetto. Both locations great food and service."}
{"text":"Love this place  we ordered kimchi friedrice mix with 3 different meats .. beef, chicken and spam that's like $3 bucks more with full size .. and kalbi Stick 3 for  $7 bucks it tasted delish .. but disappointed they have Jarritos drink bottles except tamarind  that's the best one .. but overall tasty food no MSG that's a plus !!!"}
{"text":"I heard of this and had to try it. Korean mexican fusion oh my it was delicious. A little mom n pop place that serves huge portions of great food at an even better price. At table of 5 and we all ordered plates 2 appetizers and an extra plate of rice and we only paid 65.00. Anything with the bulgogi and you can't go wrong. The bulgogi flautas and the chicken fried rice were my favorites.  We got lucky and got a table quick but it soon filled up and there was a wait. You must try this place."}
{"text":"Never fails to exceed expectations!  The service matches the fare & truly satisfies.  Aa MUST for us when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place.  Believe me when I say I have thought about it OFTEN since my last trip to Vegas.

Food, prices, service--a true five star place found in an unassuming strip mall off the strip.  Free chips and salsa upon arrival, and a check-in deal for some tasty dumplings.

I had three tacos with Kimchi (one pork, one chicken, one beef).  They were $1.50ish each.  All three were extremely generous in size, flavor, and taste.  I probably liked the beef one best.

It was one of those meals that I didn't want to finish because I'd be too sad when it was over, but I decided to eat it all because I was worried the tacos would lose their magic once Primm was in the rear-view mirror.

CHECK OUT OF YOUR HOTEL AND THEN GO HERE for lunch before driving back to LA.  My riding partner saved one of her tacos and it was still wonderful in Barstow, so you could even load up on to-go.

This place has minor issues with lack of fountain drinks (they have cans), a location that is a bit remote, and a strange bathroom; however, none of these conditions can even threaten these five stars.

A memorable meal for two at under $10.  If you haven't been here, you're making a mistake.  Sorry about all the hype."}

*Record scratching*

\"Whaat?\"



There was only one waitress so she was pretty frantic but the tacos were amazing. Deliciously flavorful. And the torta was severed on a perfectly toasted bun. We got one taco in a lettuce wrap instead of a tortilla. That was a fresh, crispy little surprise. The nachos and burrito at the table next to us looked so good that I almost asked for a bite.

We've got a new must-go in Vegas.

Now what was the name again? Tampax? Always?"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas anytime soon???? Leave the $9.99 rib-eye specials @ the strip. This place is worth the ride. KoMex is a small, quaint, family-run dive. But, your taste buds and wallet will thank you. We took a taxi(not recommended unless you schedule them to pick you back up)  Nevertheless, we waited happily for 30 minutes chatting up on how great this meal was.  In the end, taxi never showed and the owner Linda graciously offered us a ride back to our hotel.  I've never rated on yelp before and this may just be the beginning of more to come.  KoMex will be tough to beat on budget and value.  I see a bright future ahead for these folks.  THANKS AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and my wife loves Asian food. Lucky for us we have KoMex! Best of both worlds. Definitely have to try the spicy pork tacos with the fusion hot sauce. The beef is leagues above what you get from Roberto's or similar taco shops. They also have chips, salsa, and guacamole while you wait. Btw we had excellent service and the food was done within 5-10 minutes. My only suggestion would be to less oil in the cooking."}
{"text":"Fun new place, very low key, good prices and I like how they mix cultures and foods from around the world. Very unique flavor, great taste. Very friendly staff too! Love it."}
{"text":"Super cheap and delicious food near the strip! If you're ballin on a budget this is the place to go. You can choose to dine in or take out! Either way, the service was nice and the food came out super quick. The portions are huge for the price and very flavorful! The Korean spices, kimchi, and endless salsa add a unique and drool-worthy flavor to the dishes. Two dishes (chimichanga and bulgolgi rice bowl) only came out to $20! Definitely a must for those of you trying to save money before you blow it at all the night clubs! 

What I really liked about the bulgolgi rice bowl is that it came w a Korean coleslaw and a generous amount of dark leafy greens, not that iceberg lettuce stuff! Although I love the \"bad\" stuff, you gotta have some good stuff like veggies and salad! This dish is a good balance of both! I should know, I'm a nutrition professional! 

We had no trouble finding parking and it was relatively easy to find. Try the bulgolgi bowl, you won't be sorry and neither will your taste buds!"}
{"text":"OHHHH YEAH!

Love this place and will be going there a lot.  Let's start with their story.  They are a nice Korean couple who ran a Mexican market for 10 years.  Their food isn't a copy of the Kogi truck phenomenon in Southern California but rather a result of their experience at the market. They sold tacos, burritos, etc at their market.

However, they cooked food for themselves.  So they would blend mexican food with korean bbq, chinese food, etc.  Pretty soon customers would ask them what they were cooking/eating and ask if they could try it.  Long story made short - eventually their fusion food was doing much better business than the market itself.  So they made the leap to open up their own restaurant.

Now - on to the restaurant.  It doesn't have a ton of decor but that's to be expected from folks opening up their own business on a shoestring budget.  The food, however, is outstanding.

I had the following:

Burrito with Korean bbq pork.  This was definitely the highlight of my meal.  Served with a side of kimchee (though I'd recommend you ask for it inside the burrito if you want the best experience), the bbq pork is absolutely delicious.  Tender, flavorful, sweet, and savory.  Served with rice and veggies inside.  They serve the kimchee on the side cause they are worried about how Americans will react to it.  But I think you need the tangy kimchee to balance out the richness of the meat.  That's standard cooking.  The owners also bring you 3 hot sauces.  A korean chili, mexican hot sauce, and the owners' own house made hot sauce.  I'm not a big hot sauce person, but the owners' sauce was really excellent and flavorful.

Taco with bulgogi (beef).  A big, meaty taco that has too much to eat without spilling out the fillings.  I don't think that's necessarily great to have so much on top but I know others will love the value.  Served with a lime wedge as is traditional.  Nice tender, flavorful meat with nice crispy veggies.  

They serve you tortilla chips and salsa while you wait.  They seen to be from flour rather than corn tortillas which is unorthodox but fine.  

The value is definitely there.  It's cheap.  I actually think they should raise the price a buck on all the food and move to a richer neighborhood but that's just me.  I will back here many times.  This is really a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Kept reading good reviews on this place so we finally checked it out. Had the kimchi fried rice with 3 choices of meat (chicken, beef, spam); bulgogi tater tots and wings. The tots were the best of the three, they were very crunchy and crispy. The kimchi fried rice I found to be a bit too salty and somehow the rice came out really wet. with fried rice, it's gotta be dry. The wings were good, but nothing to write home about. I would probably come here again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't come out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends eager to eat some Korean Mexican fusion reminiscent of Roy choy's kogi truck.  If you dine in, they give you free chips and salsa. Love that!! They also refill it for you too when you're done. 

We ordered the bulgogi tatter tots, the bulgogi rice bowl, kimchi fried rice and the chimichanga. I must say that the portions here are very generous!  We ordered the half portion of the kimchi fried rice but was unable to finish it and I had tons of it for left overs. My favorite I think was the fried rice. I love the tart and spicy flavor of the kimchi in combination with spam. The chimichanga was good but I thought the tortillas was too thick and took away form the flavor. The bulgogi tatter tots looks amazing and it did taste great but I felt there could have been more kimchi and gochugang flavor. The tots were crispy and the bulgogi was sweet but I wanted a little more spicy and tart flavors in the mix. The bulgogi rice was good but not super impressive. If that's what your craving for then go for it but it's not the most adventurous item of the menu. 

The owners here are really nice and friendly and he service is wonderful. I thought overall he food was delicious and will come back again!"}
{"text":"It definitely not what I expecting in a good way. They were able to combine Korean and Mexican food in a unique way, and was very good."}
{"text":"Korean and Mexican fusion hits the spot! Place is amazing and super grub! A must try that is cheap!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Great food, very different, reasonably priced, good atmosphere.  Try the pork belly taco.  Plus the homemade salsas and guacamole are very good.  I love how close this place is to my house.  Plus they have the Mexican coke in the glass bottles!"}
{"text":"Love the concept, pretty happy with some tacos, other dishes are pretty average. 

- chicken nachos, very meh, not sure if it's because nachos should never be made fusion style or the lack of the korean sauce ruined it. 
- Calamari tacos-- MEH, Do Not get.  Basically two fishstick like pieces of calamari with tartar sauce, Disgusting. 

Onto the good. 
- Fish taco is delectable. Very well seasoned and tasty. 


I've had shrimp and bulgogi at the other location and those did not disappoint, 

the Pork belly was average, nothing to write home about, not very flavorful, it sounds exotic, but it did not deliver.

Musubi w fried egg was ok. A tad on the salty side, and I would've liked more rice, but for 4$ for two giant pieces, I aint complaining.  Makes me miss Hawaii."}
{"text":"after a long hike at the Red Rock Canyon, this hit the spot. Kimchi fried rice, bulgogi tacos, and fusion fries. A little too much food for 2 hungry people but loved every bit of it!"}
{"text":"Korean Mexican Fusion...

Started in LA, expanding across the country. Very well done at KoMex with excellent service. great prices, and the proper divey feel. 

The pork belly, bulgogi, and spicy pork are great, no matter how you have it served. Be sure to have them add kimchi to whatever you order. The meat plates are generously portioned as are the nachos and tacos.

I wish there was one closer to me in San Diego..."}
{"text":"Great food! Very different.... let's just say, I was not expecting that!  Yum 
Little small place.  Try to beat the lunch rush! 
Pros: Food-Everything?  Good lunch cost.  Good portion size.  
Cons: Small hole in wall so not much room. Small amount of chips/dip. But was good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a hidden spot. You might have to wait to be seated but it will be a short wait and will be worth it. Service was good, whatever you need to know about the menu, they will explain. The bulgogi bowl was amazing. The tacos were super delicious as well. Very reasonably priced dishes."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 4 and we tried a few different things.  I had Tofu Fried Rice with a side of Kimchi.  Was super tasty and big portion.  Others had Quesidilla & Tacos.  Everyone liked their meal.  Price was right, service was great, owner super friendly.

What more can I say, a solid option if you find your self in that part of town.  

Will definitely be back, planning to try their other location as well."}
{"text":"Korean and Mexican on the same plate, in the same tortilla wrapper??... Somehow it works, and it works really well here. The ingredients are really fresh and the menu is really creative. There are \"standard\" Mexican, Chinese, and Korean items for those not brave enough to go with a bulgogi tostada, but the whole point of trying this place is to dive in and go for it. We even took our plain-eating American friend, who had never eaten Korean food, and she finished the entire plate of bulgogi, rice and kimchi (she's tiny and the portion is huge). Try several things to share, but beware, the portions are really huge, so ask for half size.

The dining area's pretty small so go at off-times if you can. Not the prettiest neighborhood but we never felt unsafe. It's in the corner of a strip mall, but no parking issues. We drove there twice from the Strip and it was totally worth it, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Komex opened up a secondary new location! It was not as busy as the original, though it's brand new and I wonder if people just don't know it's here. It's not far to head here though if the other one has a fairly long wait. 

We met up with our friends and shared a few items and got some individual tacos: 

Tacos - they now offer pork belly which was rather tasty and tender so I definitely recommend getting it on something with it. Also got daegi gogi/pork which is my other favorite taco. 

Pork Belly Fries - Lots of cheese, salsa, jalapenos and pork belly. Messy, but good and a large share- able portion.

Fusion Wings - This comes with plain fries and the wings were nicely crispy with a sticky sweet and spicy glaze. Really enjoyable as I have a little bit of a affinity for sweet and spicy wings.

Fusion Flautas - This is one of my favorite things to get. The flautas are crispy and yet fluffy fried tortilla stuffed with a good portion of meat and cheese. I enjoy the mix of guacamole with sweet Korean sauce they do. I love that there is more than enough for the flautas and extra always to dip chips in! 

Service was friendly enough. We had a second round of tacos and unfortunately it took long to get it. She did apologize and explain that a large party was before our order put in so not really their fault. 

The food taste the same, which is a good thing and I saw one of the owners here running the front so I'm glad they seem to be doing right with consistency of a second location. Will be back, it's not far from my work."}
{"text":"I know I wrote a review for this...WTF?

My first visit was decent, but it had a few hiccups that made me not too sure. I thought my tacos I had ( al pastor, daegji gogi and bulgogi) were good. We were first served by who I think is the owner and she was friendly and nice then there was a new girl and when tabulating our bill (they hand write it) it was way over. Also there was dustbunnys at the corner of our table. I'm okay with hole in the walls, but really, a dustbunny? 

We decided to try again and this time it was much cleaner. Food was still consistent. Now they have vegetarian options which is a plus so I had a tofu fusion style and a rice/beans and vegetable. The tofu was good, the veggie one only came with rice on mine but the veggies on it were fresh (stir fry mix- think broccoli, cabbage, carrot, etc).   BF loved the shrimp fusion style so now he says anytime we come here he has to get that. There is a check in special for free wontons. They are little meat filled ones (4 pcs) with some sweet chili sauce. 

The BF and I thought his family would like it so we brought them and they enjoyed it. Mom got enchiladas and she's a green sauce girl and with our luck brought them when they were making some but she said it would be better with it. The surprising standout was grandmas mongolian beef. I took a bite and that was really tender and flavorful. BF and I stuck to the fusion tacos. 

Overall, I think this place is solid cheap eats with a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great! The owner is really nice! The restaurant is clean! 

Our first time at this restaurant. We were undecided on what to get. So I yelped some pictures. I was not disappointed at all! Had the Tacos (1 beef, 1 chicken, and 1 pork) I didnt know which one I liked the most.
The kids had musubi. My daughter can eat 2 normal sized Musubis but these were a whole nother caliber. For $4 you get 2 pieces but they were huge and my daughter couldnt finish the second piece. 
Also the Bulgogi Nachos were really good. We had a half order because they give you complimentary chips and salsa ... didnt want to over do it. Definitely a must try place... support your local ma&pa businesses!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here before we went to watch a movie--we patiently waited for our food with that bowl of fried chips that they give out! 

I wasn't sure about Korean and Mexican food being blended until I had that Fusion Chimichanga..omg. It was messy and delicious and awesome! My friend vacuumed her meal right up! My other friend had the Kimchi Fried Rice..holy crap was that excellent. 

Most interesting mix of food I've ever had in my life. I would recommend this place a million times!"}
{"text":"Their bulgogi beef flautas and kimchi fried rice are amazing! Also very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while. So when the opportunity came up I took it. I was not disappointed. My husband and I stayed close to the Korean aspect of this komex restaurant. We both had the bulgogi bowls. I had the spicy pork it was very good all of the flavors worked very well together the kimchi was very good spicy and just the right notes. Very large portions I felt for the price. The star of the show was the Korean Hot Sauce which was mind-blowing delicious. They should bottle it."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm spoiled because i started eating Majority of my Korean favorites in Hawaii . Hawaii has awesome Korean food .With that being said i was not impressed . I have wanted to try for a long time . I'm glad i got it over with but i will probably not be returning everything was either OK or lacking flavor . 

We arrived at around 530 and already had plans to go to the gym . So we took it to go . Since we wanted to try the meats we decided on a Bulgogi Burrito and a combo plate with chicken and Spicy pork . This way we get to try all three meats in one visit. I  have a weakness for Korean & Mexican food so this place was a no brainer for me . 

The gentlemen who took our order was prompt to greet us and take our order . During our order I stated i wanted to have the lettuce and pico on the side since we were taking it home and eating it later . I thought the Bulgogi Burrito came with kimchee. More Korean flavor is awesome right ? Nope . In photos it shows it on the side of the burrito but i didn't get any . Thats fine . I can do without the kimchee . What i cant do without is flavorless meat . That's what we got . 


Bulgogi Burrito - The wimpy burrito had rice and bulgogi or whats supposed to be bulgogi. People claiming there burritos were humongous . Not mine i could have got a bigger burrito at Roberto's . Maybe it was small because it didn't have lettuce or pico in it . Honestly who wants lettuce in a burrito if food is served warm the lettuce would become soggy . Not a good idea IMO . The meat was lacking flavor and the rice well mexcian rice is simple so nothing stand outish or special about this at all. I even put the sweet/spicy red sauce on the burrito and frankly that's the only thing that saved it . Not to mention my first bite was gristle . I hate gristle . Uhhhh ! Annoying ! 

Combo Plate - Chicken ans Spicy Pork Combo Plate , Sub white Rice for Spanish rice . 

Chicken well it was just chicken not to much flavor just tasted like cut up sauteed chicken . Could use some salt thats how bland it was . 

Spicy Pork  - Not even close ? Bland , boring , and weak . 

Sauces - Theres a red one that has a weird vinegary taste . Not a fan 

Sweet/Spicy Sauce - I actually liked the sweet/spicy sauce that has a sesame flavor , Actually i loved it . I would eat it on any food that i put hot sauce on . 

Green Sauce - Standard green Sauce its aiiightt 

Pico De Gallo - Needs more cilantro IMO it was ok . Pico doesnt need that much attention not even this was good . 

Korean Slaw - Cabbage and cilantro slaw basically . Also boring . Tasteless and boring . I paid a dollar for this crap . 

Just get this meal over with is all i can think about . Maybe the marinades need tweaking or marinade for longer . I don't know but they didn't win me over Komex fusion needs to fuse some flavor because Flavortown kicked them out upon arrival ."}
{"text":"Good impression fusion resto. The chili fusion hot sauce gives me the firemans sweat kind of hot!!! Love the bulgogi during my first visit, the upfront disclosure and neatness. I will definitely come back for more to try the other interesting palate enticing dishes!"}
{"text":"I would like to thank all my Yelpmates for their wonderful reviews. If it wasn't for them I would have  no clue about this place. You know who you guys are your all on my Yelp friends list who have reviewed KoMex. You guys ROCK!

So I woke up today around 4:00pm, still a bit jet lagged from my Asia trip, and i was craving Asian food, but something different than my usual eats.

So I decided to finally check out KoMex. I was a bit reluctant to go because it is so freaking far from where I live. I checked out google maps and it told me it was going to take me 30 minutes to get there.

I decided to go anyways and give it a whirl. I texted my roommates and they too wanted to go with me.

About 25 minutes later we finally reached KoMex located on Decatur in small plaza. ( I must say DAMN! they need to open one in Henderson)

The location is a bit far but i must say i do not regret going. The HYPE about this place is true! This place is awesome!

I ordered the Bulgogi Taco and the Pork Taco which were cheap only $1.29 each.  Both tacos were to die for! They were a perfect size too!

We also decided to try the Bulgogi Nachos for $7.99. This nachos is not your typical nachos. The chips itself even taste way better than your average mexican restaurant chips and their salsa and cheese are way awesome too. The nachos was so good i highly recommend this dish while over there.

So since this place was far i decided to order more food. I figured hey might as well, I don't finish it at least I have leftovers for a midnight snack or breakfast tomorrow. So i deicded to order the Kimchi fried rice with beef. I must say it was orgasmic! I'm normally not a fan of Kimchi, because it's too spicy for me. But who cares after eating KoMex's  nachos.

Overall i give this place a  5 star. Good food! Very cheap! and friendly staff.

 I am looking forward to try the Bulgogi Fries on my next visit. Try now! Komex will give you the ultimate FUSION experience between Korean and Mexican!"}
{"text":"The original KoMex is about 1 mile closer to home but I opt to come here:
- Easy to get seating since it's a larger place.
- Beer is available.
- Same great food I've become addicted to.  
- For the price, KoMex is my favorite place to eat in Vegas.  I eat here at least twice a month."}
{"text":"Since I only live 4 miles from KoMex, I love coming here regularly since my first visit around Sep 2011.  By \"Checking-In\" on my Yelp Android App, I also get a free wontons serving (4 pieces, normally $1 but tastes much more expensive than that) as part of my unbelievably cheap but delicious meal.

I've introduced my visiting Cali friends to this place and they've all loved it.  I usually order their \"Special of the Week\" listed on their dry-erase board next to the fridge.  I'm an atheist, but I pray to the higher powers that be that KoMex opens a branch in Spring Valley so all of their fusion food goodness is even closer to my house."}
{"text":"We decided to throw my son's 1st communion reception at this Komex location and it was the best experience. You wouldn't think to throw a big group party here, but Linda and the staff made hosting my party of 40 people a breeze. Linda made the reservation and ordering process so simple. She answered EVERY question I had and made sure I was well taken care of throughout the whole party. The staff was so helpful and the food was fresh and ready to serve when I requested. They split my appetizers of bulgogi fries into proportionate servings so that I could spread it out amongst my guests and they set up a buffet-style area to serve the main dishes. They even allowed my to drop off my cake to hang on to until serving time and provided a knife and plates for that as well. I was worried about the expenses of drinks since they only sell by the can or bottle but they provided pitchers (actually fancy serving bottles) of filtered water to offset that cost tremendously and I just ordered non-water beverages for whoever wanted it. They set up the tables in rows so my party can all sit together, and they also covered the tables with tableclothes for a more elegant appeal. I also appreciated the complimentary salsa and chips to feed my guests until everyone arrived. Thank you all so much for such an amazing experience and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The bulgogi and calamari tacos are awesome! Definitely worth a trip off the strip. The food is so tasty, serviing size, ad price is just right!"}
{"text":"Korean and Mexican food. perfect combo... well the most common fusion combination I think. they do a decent job. I've tried it several times and ate most of the items on the menu. I like to order a lot. lol
I really like the tacos. its small and I can still order something else to munch on. philly cheesesteak wasn't the greatest. I say avoid that and the sliders. stick with Mexican dishes. burritos are always a safe choice. my go to meat is pork belly, but most people seem to order the bulgogi."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 19/100***

I called ahead to check if there was a wait for dinner, the lady said nope c'mon down. It was our first time at this location, this one is so much bigger so lesser wait time and doesn't feel like you're sitting on top of each other like their location on Decatur. 

There was only two other couple when we got there. Our server Linda told us to pick a spot and she'll be right with us. Within minutes she came back with the complimentary chips, salsa, guac and some water. She promptly returned with our drinks and then took our orders. We decided on kimchi fried rice, Korean wings, a pork belly taco and the surprisingly good bulgogi cheesesteak with fries. It was my first time trying the cheesesteak (thanks Ghia) and I think I've found my new favorite. It's so full of flavor with the perfectly marinated bulgogi, onions, peppers and oozing cheese. Not soon after, people started coming in as dinner rush was starting. 

Even though Linda was a one woman show, she handled herself well and still gave stellar service. This will be our chosen location as it's closer to home and a better dining experience altogether."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews of this place, I decided to try it out because I love fusion foods! My mom and I got the bulgogi rice bowl w/ fried rice, bulgogi chimichanga, and a side tater tots. We thought that the foods were a little heavy/salty for our taste buds unfortunately..  It sure was tasty but after a certain amount of time of digging in, the carbs and meat knocked us out to where we couldn't finish it. I definitely suggest that a main entree is shareable between two people. What I did absolutely love though were the tater tots! They were nice and crispy throughout our time. (:"}
{"text":"Korea and Mexico are almost 7,000 miles apart.  The only herb in common, cilantro.  Why the fusion works?  Who cares.  Its just really good grindz.

All three fusion tacos (bul-gogi, dak-gogi, and daeji-gogi) are great.  The proteins are all deeply marinated, slightly charred and overcooked (it works) and served hot with cabbage, tomato, cilantro, green onions, all overstuffed in a corn tortilla.  Perfect contrast of both temperatures and textures.  Add some kimchee and hot sauce (several choices but the Asian works best) and you got it all (sweet, sour, bitter, spicy).  Fusion street food heaven!

The burrito is equally good.  Same great beef, chicken, or pork with the same taco toppings and the addition of seasoned rice all wrapped up in a flour tortilla.  Once again, squeeze some lime, add some hot sauce and its all good!  (It even taste good cold especially at 2am at the tables). 

Prices are...heck, dirt cheap ($1.29 a taco, $4.99 for a burrito).  Dine in and you get free chips, salsa, and guacamole.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Komex is one of the hidden gems of Vegas. If I hadn't found it on Yelp, I probably wouldn't have discovered the awesome fusion food it has to offer.

The bulgogi fries are amazing, and they give you a TON. Even with 3 people sharing it as an appetizer, we've had to bring home leftovers. It's just the perfect blend of cheese, salsa, and bulgogi on a bed of french fries.

I've been here a handful of times now, and almost every time I order the fusion burrito with bulgogi beef. Usually, I like to try different things when I go to a restaurant, but when I go to Komex, I'm craving that fusion burrito and can't be deterred.

The service is a little on the slow side, but they're all really friendly. You also have to realize they don't have a really big kitchen to work with. They have even put up a sign recommending you call in first. My hope is that they one day expand or find a bigger place because it is almost like a hole in the wall joint right now.

All in all, Komex has really decent fusion food to offer for a great price. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The Korean fusion thing has been getting a little out of hand. Since Kogi truck, korean-inspired foods have been popping up everywhere. I'm a little bit of a Korean-food purist--why mess with a good thing? But I can't complain (too much) about the grub they serve up at KoMex.

FUSION TACOS: You have the option of beef, chicken, or pork. I sampled one of each in addition to a plain old shrimp taco. I added fried kimchi on one of them for an extra $1.. I won't ever do that again. Kimchi is good with a lot of things; just not on my tacos. The kimchi was a little too sour for my taste. The tacos without that extra Korean element were quite good though! The cabbage was crunchy, and it was balanced with just the perfect amount of onion, cilantro, and darn good pico.

VARIETY: This tiny restaurant has a huge menu. Korean Mexican food, Mexican food, American food, and Chinese. Now if they only made donuts... I want to say they're DTM. But the food here is good. I tried a little of everything; nothing great, nothing awful. The 'KoMex' gimmick isn't anything special. But if you're craving a cheeseburger with your KBBQ taco and taquitos, KoMex is a one stop shop."}
{"text":"I don't like to write reviews for places that have a lot of reviews already. But this place is deeeeeelicious and I would like to share my thoughts. 

My friends have been telling me about it for awhile, and I had heard about it but I was kind of nervous with the whole Asian/Mexican fusion. It didn't sound too appealing to me. This is a dive, but as I always say, I have found some of the most amazing food in the most unexpected places. 

I remembered it the other day when we were running errands and my boyfriend didn't sound too excited either after I told him what it was. I assured him that I trusted my friend's opinion and that it had really good reviews on Yelp. 

We had the following - (Mind you, this was only two of us.)
Fushion Shrimp Taco 
Fushion Daeji gogi Taco
2 chicken flautas
Fusion Enchilada Plate with shrimp, Bulgogi (Beef), Dak-gogi (Chicken).
They serve chips, salsa and guacamole. All very good. The salsa is awesome. 
Oh, as always...a Mexican coke.
This was all $17.00.

All very amazing. We both LOVED everything. Even the sauces they give you for the food were delicious!
 I went back the NEXT DAY and got the Chow Fettuccine(Thick Noodles with Meat* and Vegetables) with beef. 

***Warning, they do use a lot of garlic, so expect to be tasting it for awhile after you eat. 

I love this place, and it is one of my new favorites. The prices are AWESOME, service is friendly and very quick. Don't let the idea scare you, it's much better than you can imagine."}
{"text":"its really just OK. not really worth the gas money to drive all the way out north for me. I had the tacos, nachos and fried rice. the ingredients are fresh for sure, but both the tacos and nachos looks better than they taste. something about the flavor just wasn't quite there. the fried rice was the winner out of the three, but i can easily get better fried rice in Chinatown, closer to where i live."}
{"text":"KoMex is definitely a five star restaurant!  The sauces at the table is what makes your experience that much more flavorful.  They make each item to order and you can tell they take their time in making it just right.  My favorite is the Mexican burrito and seasoned fries.  The ambiance is casual and the customer service is fantastic.  If you pay with cash you get a 5% discount.

This is a hole in the wall place but with amazing food."}
{"text":"Drove from the Strip to eat here. Worth the drive. We could eat here again and again and never try all the wonderful food. We took food home with us because we had to much. Will Korean Nachos be good after driving 4 hours to California? Guess we will see. At least we'll have food if traffic is slow getting back to LA area. Oops spoke to soon, traffic just stopped on the 15 and were nor even to the stateliness. [Nachos may not make it to CA]"}
{"text":"The food is sooooo good you taste the freshness and the customer service is great spicy chicken is delicious add mixed vegetables for only $1"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! I had the bulgogi fries and another dish I was so full but couldnt stop eating..will be going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best lunch I've ever had. We tried Pork belly sticks and bulgogi quesadilla and will be back tomorrow for lunch. They give so much food for the price. Staff is so friendly and helpful for making suggestions."}
{"text":"Wow! This place exceeded my expectation! My husband and I came here for a quick meal before work. We came to this place because in a book called \"4 hour chef\" by Timothy Ferris. He rated best restaurants in the U.S and this was one of them. It was actually pretty good! My husband had the spicy pork plate, which he really enjoyed. I didn't try it because I can not stand spicy, haha. :D
I had 2 fish tacos, and it was soo good. The fish tasted so fresh and the balance of fish and cabbage and pico de gallo was perfect. 
We also had bulgogi nachos. Wow, so great! Give it a try! And very affordable!"}
{"text":"We tried the tacos (Bulgogi, Pork Belly, and Calamari), KoMex Nachos w/KimChi, and Wonton soup. Everything was delicious and the meat was really cooked perfectly! There wasn't a bunch of fat on it and it wasn't rubbery or chewy. Their slaw they put on the tacos is kind of sweet and if you want hot sauce they bring you 4 types (2 Mexican and 2 Korean), though none of it is really that spicy. Food portions were decent and my wife and I ended up with take out after ordering only a half size nacho and soup to split with the tacos. Service was friendly and the price was reasonable. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great concept! You have to love  korean food in order to enjoy the fusion of both. My Latin friends didn't  enjoy  it as much as I did. I'm filipino and enjoy all Asian foods. Living  in San Diego I got a lot of Mexican food being so close to the border. I love this place! The other reviews are all on point. I'm gonna make this my new fav. When I'm in town. Fast, friendly service. What more can you ask for right!"}
{"text":"Why the change in stars?  I think the food got better than the last time I was here...maybe it is in my head...dunno.

Either way, I ordered the bulgogi fries again, but this time without the kim chi.  I love kim chi, but these were WAY better without the KC...

Went with a bulgogi burrito...WAY better than the tacos IMO.  I had a few tacos this time, as well as remembering last time, and it is way better in the burrito fashion to me.

I also tried some fish tacos...the regular fish taco was ok, not bad at all, but I prob won't order it again.  However, the calamari taco comes with a different sauce, and it was super good.  Very tender meat, and the sauce pulls it all together.  Bravo!

I'll be back again :)"}
{"text":"KoMex Fusion brings it!  My girlfriend and I travel across town regularly just to enjoy that sweet, sweet, KoMex meat.  
My favorite item is the Bulgogi Philly Cheesesteak.  I've turned many friends on to KoMex, and many have become huge fans of the kimchi fried rice.  The puffed rice tostada is unique and delicious.  The iced tea is also one of a kind."}
{"text":"You have to try this place! Their bulgogi burrito is amazing and would recommend to anyone. You can always order half if you want to try more and not get full too quick. Their service and waiting is okay, considering it does take a while to cook the food and it seems to be busy whenever we come. The only downside I saw was their spam musubi, which is not the best I've tried but the rest of the menu is worth trying."}
{"text":"Saw this facility on the foot networks \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" and had to say it didn't meet up to the shows hype, hype kills... Food was somewhat generic and oily... Granted it was tasty to a certain degree on my pallet but nothing worth mentioning afterwards nor was it worth the \"drive\" to get there... I guess I hyped myself up for failure... Place is worth another visit if I was ever in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic but the cute waiter totally made the experience. He was very sweet and accommodating with great suggestions... Very personable and attentive. He was very fun too and offered to sing the menu! Priceless. Ask for Chris and ask him to sing his recommendations!"}
{"text":"So we stumbled in here because babystackz was super packed and we were starving. When we walked in we were able to pick wherever we wanted to seat and that was cool. Started looking over the menu and wasn't too sure if id like it here not. So I'll just go on to rate the food

Calamari tacos (4.5/5) kind of expecting squid with tentacles but nope just strips so probably frozen. But the flavors were so simple and tasted great.

Chimichanga with bulgogi beef (3.99/5) when I'm eating something with bulgogi I feel as if I'm exPecting the meat to totally blow my mind with bursting flavors but it wasn't as bulgogi as I expected. I'm not sure that makes sense but some of you that read this may know what I'm taking about. The Mexican part of this dish was very good and their salsas that you can put on this are all great

Pork belly musubis (5/5)- omg! This was probably my favorite thing here. it wasn't just covered with teriyaki sauce like most
places just to give the meat flavor cooked right the pork belly had the good crisp on it like bacon but I would like it a little more crisp. The coolest thing was our waitress did say I could add an egg on it and have like mini breakfast musubis so ill be back to try this for sure

Kimchi fried rice( 3/5) this dish needs some work so I don't have that much to say but the flavors need to be brought it with more vegetables that I feel were missing from a kimchi fried rice. I don't mind the soggy sometimes as long as fried rice has that little burnt taste like it was cooked on a hot wok but it wasn't there and too mushy.

Korean Chicken wings (3/5)-one of my favorite things if done right but some disappointing news for you here from me was the chicken was frozen and fried which made it hard. im very picky when it comes to chicken and yeah it didn't compare to the same wings from soyo or buldogis.

The prices and the service was good so we will definitely be back to try other things I just hope I can give my honest review first and maybe they can work on these things and ill enjoy the food more going forward."}
{"text":"Komex Fusion is doing big things in Las Vegas. The creation of Korean, Mexican, Chinese, and American infused dishes is pure genius.
When I hear of great places to eat...I am on my way! Hidden in a small mini mall, I found food greatness! Today was my first time eating Komex Fusion and I will admit, it's the best taco I had in about 5 years. Yes...5 long years. Of course, I didn't just eat a taco...lol.
The wontons-Spicy beef and pork, stuffed inside a wonton wrapper and deep fried, served with a spicy dipping sauce!
The Bulgogi Fusion Burrito-Thinly sliced spiced beef, Mexican Rice, Green and Brown Onions, Pico de gallo, and Cheese, wrapped inside a fresh flour tortilla shell. The meat is seasoned to perfection, I really have no words, it's so good, it shut my mouth!
Lastly, but not least, the Bulgogi Beef Tacos is it! Spicy Meat, cabbage slaw, melty cheese. They taste like it was marinated in Korean spices, then cooked on the flat top, creating little bites of crispy, tender, joys of beef!"}
{"text":"It pains me to give my beloved komex three stars, but it's what I felt was deserved on my lunch here.

Overall the same yummy food. I mean seriously how they do make the perfect creation of fries each time I come. Their bulgogi fries are to die for, and like I said it's one of the best fries you can get in Vegas.

But sadly, it is not the same as the original komex. Maybe its the lack of workers? But it seemed like it took FOREVERRRR to get my food here. Along with re fills of my precious water. Maybe it's because I came in during lunch and there was only one person working. But still there were probably only three customers in total. That and the prices are totally raised up from what they were two years ago.

Still....those damn bulgogi fries hold a special place in my heart.

Prooo tip: If you're in a rush call in advance and you can pick up the food!!!!"}
{"text":"MMMMMMMMM EFFING BULGOGI FRIES FOR THE WIN ONE OF THE BEST FRIES I'VE HAD IN VEGAS!!!

I've come here more than a handful of times and I've gotten their burritos, mongolian beef, and tacos. But none of that compares to the fries they serve. These fries taste like fries that food gods DREAM to eat. Ughhh, they're soooo cheesy you can never pick up just one fry, the cheese just drags more fries with it. It's that cheesy! And to set it off the jalapenos give that extra spicy bam in your mouth.

Parking is shouldn't be that bad, but the wait times are very unstable. Some nights its a 30 minute wait, other nights no wait.

Another plus is the service. If you do dine in it comes with some free chips and salsa, and an orange :)  . I usually haven't had a problem with long waits for food or refills.

If you're in the area definitely give this place a chance! You will not regret it! 

P.S. If you're in a rush call in advance and you can pick up the food!!!!"}
{"text":"I had just landed at LAS and my friends picked me up at the airport. My first stop in Vegas was KOMEX. 

It's in a small shopping center and has limited parking. We go inside and there are about 8-10 tables maybe?? They greet us as we enter and asked if we'd like to dine in or get carry-out. We dine in and they let us choose where we would like to sit. We sat down, looked over the menu and got chips & dip, bulgogi fries, bulgogi taco, chicken taco and kimchi fried rice wth a fried egg on top. 

Everything was UHh-may-zing. bulgogi tacos came on corn tortilla with really fresh pico de gaillo type of toppings--diced tomatoes, white onions, cilantro, red and white cabbage.  We asked for hot sauce and they brought over a spice tray, which is amazing for us spicy-hot lovers. I was expecting Tobasco sauce but they came out with red chili mix sauces (total of 4 on a tray). We tried every single one of them and they aren't too spicy but they still have some kick to it and were very flavorful.  Bulgogi fries came out with fries at the bottom, topped with bulgogi and melted cheese and the usual toppings. SOOOO good. the fries weren't soggy (yet) and it came with jalapeno peppers, which was an awesome bonus. The Kimchi fried rice was spectacular. It came out a little later since they cook everything to order.  It was hot, it was spicy, kimchi was good and slighly crunchy, and it was really delicious. I highly recommend this dish.

The server was very attentive to us and everyone else there. She was really nice and checked up on us frequently. It was about 3pm when I arrived, so perhaps they weren't all THAT busy during that time.  But people came trickling in.  I saw that other people ordered burritos, which looked good from afar. Next time I visit Las Vegas, I gotta stop by here again and try the other items."}
{"text":"\"hidden gem\" yada yada

Been here twice, not thouroughly impressed with the food, but I would come back since they have such a creative menu.

REVIEW OF FOOD:
- bulgogi torta: came out a little soggy.  YUMMMM love damp bread... NOT. But bulgogi is awesome and so are tortas. Would have been better if they could somehow contain those juices better

- kimchi fried rice + bulgogi: freakin' LARGE serving. Almost too much rice to just have as your meal. One thing, there was def NOT ENOUGH bulgogi in the rice. I had to dig around to make sure I had proportionate rice to meat ratio per bite.

- bulgogi burrito: after the semi-disappointment with the torta, the burritio was next on my list to try. It was disappointingly bland!!  I had higher expectations but I guess I built myself up too much.

- chips + avocado and salsa are complimentary

- saw someone order what looked like a chicken and white rice plate...looked pretty tasty so that's something I'd consider trying next time. 

- my friend could not stop raving about the calamari taco - said the calamari was cooked to perfection and crispy. Good enough to order another one, on top of the 2 other tacos and burrito she ordered.

Not overly thrilled with the food here, but I'd go again to try a few other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Food was very good! And they are super friendly. They checked up on me multiple times and asked me if everything is okay with a smile. I ordered the bulgogi tacos with Kim chee and spicy pork bulgogi with rice. Better than any other fusion place I tried. Will be a regular here from now on."}
{"text":"I love Korean food. And I love Mexican food, how awesome is it to combine the two? Well, it's really good!!

Definitely must-try's are Bulgolgi fries, even the half size is very big... lots of fries with jalapenos, cheese and bulgogi- it's a very savory and filling mix. And OMG, the kimchi fried rice was HELLA good, greasy, but that's because it's fried. The fried rice packed a lot of flavors in every bite, my favorite dish here! If you want a healthier option, the chicken fusion burrito is delicious and feels very light. The chicken tasted like it was lightly grilled or boiled, but something about it made it very moist, yet very healthy (non-greasy). The salsa in the burrito is really refreshing!

The restaurant is a little crowded. The workers are sooo nice and pretty attentive. The prices are really good considering the amount you get. 

Just fyi, if you want spices, you have to ask for it. :)

They also give you chips, salsa, and guacamole when you come in."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Perfect hole in the wall experience.  We got the Bulgogi Taters and the Rice Bowl.  Loved them.  The tater tots were so crunchy and delicious and the rice bowl was packed with kimchi flavor.  Even the chips and salsa here were great.  Some of the best chips I've ever had."}
{"text":"Yummy food! Great service! Cheap prices! one star off for ambience, but you can go wearing t-shirt and flip flops"}
{"text":"I'd heard about KoMex a couple of years ago, from a friend.  Its been on my bookmarks list for ages, and this past weekend, we finally decided to check it out.

We got there about 4pm on a Friday night, and the place was completely empty.  
The space is very big, and open.  Its bright, and clean. 

We were greeted and given chips and salsa (and guac, but we had her take that back due to my allergy.)  The chips were great, and we were told that they make them in house.

I'd already glanced at the menu online, but they had a couple things that hadn't been listed online...like the Bulgogi Tater.  
A huge skillet filled with tater tots, bulgogi beef, smokey pork belly, bacon, sour cream, cheese, and green onions...I had to try this.   It was absolutely delicious, but I won't order it again unless I have 2-3 more people to share it with, it was enormous.  

I also went with the bulgogi beef fusion taco.  My husband had a bulgogi beef fusion, pork belly fusion and shrimp fusion taco.  The shrimp taco he had on a lettuce wrap.  (More like a lettuce cup.

I had anticipated small street tacos like I'm used to at other taco shops.  
Not these...these were much bigger than anticipated, and packed full of flavor.  
The bulgogi was sweet and tender.  The slaw was a perfect compliment.  The shrimp was PERFECTLY cooked.  

My fella also ordered the wonton soup, and this was a revelation.  Light fragrant broth.  Tender wontons.  Absolutely delicious. 

Service was friendly and quick, and the price can't be beat. 

I was extremely pleased with my visit, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first Korean-Chinese-Mexican fusion experience! and I loved it :D

I'll get right to the point- CHEAP, DELICIOUS, SIMPLE

I had the BUL-GOGI (BEEF) FRIED RICE BOWL ($6.99)- okay so the flavor was \"eh\" in fact, it didn't have much flavor, but for the price, they give you enough for lunch, dinner, and lunch again. I mean the portions were huge. I would get this plate again ONLY because if you pour a little Korean sauce on it it tastes delicious!

My BF had a taste of the Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Fish tacos- loaded with tasty toppings and only ($1.29 each) not bad. The final verdict was PORK tacos, YUM. The fish taco was tasty but they put sour cream when it might have tasted better with a creative fish sauce or \"KoMex fusion\" sauce of some sort- just sayin... 

MUST TRY the BULGogi Nacho Fries- OMG soooo goood! 

While you're waiting they give you a side of chips, salsa, and guacamole and no tap water for these peeps- it's bottled water all the way baby!

The restaurant itself is small and it seemed super busy during the lunch hour. The service was mediocre but the waitress was friendly and helpful for us first time customers :)"}
{"text":"Believe the hype!!!
It was my first visit to KoMex Fusion today and it is already in my top five Vegas restaurants. I am seriously smitten! 
We tried the chicken fried rice, tofu fried rice, the beef tacos and the bulgogi nachos. The bulgogi nachos were the stand out, but all four dishes were insanely good. Like, dream-about-them-for-days-until-you-finally-give-up-and-go-right-back-to-KoMex-again-good.
Baby-friendliness rules my world and Komex definitely has it. Our waitress was super quick with a high chair, was very careful about placement of the spicy salsas (all three of which were excellent, by the way!) and even engaged my baby in sign language when she saw us signing with him. Awesome!
Don't hold off any longer...and don't keep KoMex stashed in your yelp bookmarks for even one more day...just go!!:)"}
{"text":"Bulgogi nachos are amazing.  It's a Korean fusion restaurant, and they definitely did it right.  

It's not fancy. It's in a small strip mall way off the Las Vegas strip. But if you're in town and willing to venture off the strip for some good eats, this is definitely a place I would recommend.  

Service is sub par, but I didn't expect anything fancy from a tiny strip mall restaurant. The food didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I've bookmarked this place for... i'd say over 2 years but was never able to try it until my recent trip to vegas. I'd say the dishes are $7+ (except the tacos). I got the bulgogi fries and it was preeeettty spicy. So if you're not into spicy, ask for the jalapenos to be removed but I'm unsure if they're able to do that.. so maybe ask. My cousin tried the pastrami (but it's bulgogi) sandwich and it was delicious. That was around $9.. +tax. My brother got half portion of the fried rice and it was delicious as well. All of the stuff we ordered were really large portions. I couldn't finish the fries so I shared it with my boyfriend. My cousin only ate 3/4 of his bulgogi sandwich and let us all take a bite out of it. 

Oh, and complimentary chips and salsa (and guac). 

I liked it but didn't love it."}
{"text":"So we found this local joint on Yelp, and had to give them a whirl since we had a great Asian/Mexican fusion experience at Korilla in NYC.  We actually went twice just to make sure we gave them a far shake.  Unfortunately, though good, we've had better.  The beef was too salty both times, and the veggies were pretty few compared to the carbs when we opted to go healthier the second time   However, the Pork belly Mitsubi was unlike anything we've ever had... a must experience.  Sadly, we really wanted to like this place... but would still recommend and have you decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Vegas!!! Korean/Mexican fusion is a unique/delicious concept.  The Chow Fettuccini is a must try!"}
{"text":"Korean Mexican fusion. You can't go wrong with that combination!

The bulgolgi fries or nachos is definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered the bulgogi fries and kimchi fried rice, and was not that impressed. Plus, my husband got sick after eating it and was in the bathroom the rest of the night.

Also, it's located in a sketchy shopping center. We're willing to give it another try because I love Asian fusion.. but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just how I want my food Mexican Korean yum. I recommend this place. Korean food and Mexican food. Best of both worlds. It's just a pricey but other than that it's good."}
{"text":"My family and I came here today for lunch. Small shop, but great customer service. I am Vegan but my family isn't so it can be tricky sometimes to find a spot that we all like. I was pleasantly surprised that they had meat substitutes with tofu or vegetables! Awesome. I ordered 2 Komex tacos with tofu, and a side order of Kimchee fried rice. My husband ordered the Bulgogi burrito and he absolutely loved it. My daughter had a spam musubi and son ordered the cheeseburger with fries. I was also happy that they had stevia and sugar in the raw as an option for my tea. My food was delicious but I would recommend done thing. To maybe marinate and fry the tofu so it has a crispier texture when placed in the tacos. Over-all, great experience."}
{"text":"Items ordered:

A locally owned institution, the \"Korean, Mexican, American\" concept proudly promoted on outdoor signage, it was finally on Thursday that KoMex Fusion proved interesting enough to investigate, a two o'clock in the afternoon arrival finding several menu-options unavailable even as the restaurant seemed sorely lacking for patrons.

Officially location number two, the North Decatur original spawning a sibling spot in late 2013, those entering Komex Fusion on South Buffalo are promptly greeted by a server/hostess standing at the kitchen-front podium, a sprawl of tables laid-out right and left with a bar showing sports providing alternative entertainment to the overly-loud IHeartRadio soundtrack.

Asked whether dine-in or to-go, the choice to stay followed by a gesture to sit anywhere one likes, it was with menu and water soon in hand that choices were debated, the idea of Mexican Meat-market owners spinning Asian suggesting a little from each column, though the decision was immediately nullified when the server announced they were \"all out\" of Noodles.

Essentially removing 1/8 of the menu, a suggestion that \"Fusion Fries\" could somehow replace Fettuccine a bizarre one indeed, it was instead Mexican and American that tastes trended, a three-item order tallying just over $17 after tax and tip.

Happy that single tastes of several items are available, no up-charge compared to larger plates, lunch began with a Fusion Slider featuring marinated Beef atop a soft Bun with traditional condiments and Korean Hot Sauce, the heat actually quite mild just as it was when rolled in a crispy Tortilla with a dollop of chopped Avocado.

Amused by the teensy cup of Salsa served with complimentary Chips, especially when accounting for large portions and low prices across the menu, it was next in an enormous Burrito that appetite was invested, the \"spicy Pork\" eschewed in favor of Chicken that was unfortunately a bit gristly, the addition of Mexican Rice an Grilled onions none-too-different from a ten-plus year recollection of Chipotle with added disappointment provided by the fact that the Korean Pancake dessert was \"unavailable,\" just some complimentary Orange slices to finish instead of an outsourced \"Cronut Sundae.\"

**Understanding that specials sometimes sell-out, but never understanding the point of a laminated menu with unavailable options, KoMex success seems largely attributable to big portions and low prices, a one-and-done sort of place in a city with no lack of more delicious and authentic low-cost dining options."}
{"text":"This is a tiny little hole in the wall in a strip mall on North Decatur. I have been reading about on Yelp for a long time, finally decided there was no time like the present to try this restaurant. 

There are maybe about 10 tables. We came early which is good, because as dinnertime approached it became much busier.

All the food was absolutely wonderful. I had the bulgogi plate with chicken and pork belly. Very nice. The carne asado tacos were so good I'll definitely have to order them next time we come back. 

All food is prepared completely from scratch, to order. So, it may take a little while to get your food, but wow, well worth the wait! Service was fantastic, very efficient, and prices were beyond reasonable for the quality of food we enjoyed. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So pretty average which is surprising based on the reviews of this place. We ordered the Kim Chee fried rice. The pork chimichanga. And the beef bulgogi and spicy pork plate. The fried rice was heavy on the Kim chee flavor which is fine but it was a little too wet with Kim chee juice. The chimichanga wasn't too bad. Can't go wrong with a fried burrito essentially. The beef bulgogi was disappointing; dry and tough. The flavor also wasn't what I expected it was more sweet than anything. The spicy pork was pretty good but not very spicy and also a bit dry. Service though was awesome! The guy was maybe the owner or manager; he was very nice. Overall I may try this place again maybe it was an off day."}
{"text":"My group and I ate lunch here before we left Vegas. I gotta say, it definitely did not disappoint! While we were waiting for the food, we were presented with plates of tortilla chips, guacamole and salsa. It was quite addicting and almost made us forget that we were waiting for food. 

We got the fusion burrito (consisted of bulgogi, rice, lettuce and pico de gallo), pork belly tacos, beef bulgogi rice plate, pork belly musubi (warning: these are HUGE) and kimchi fried rice with spam and spicy pork (topped off with a huge fried egg). 

Portions were huge and we all left with happy, full stomachs. Service was awesome--our waitress was super patient and sweet and never hesitated to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"I saw all the reviews and decided to try it. It was awesome. It was Mexican food infused by Koreans."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken fusion quesadilla and it was filling.  The chicken was grilled and the dish itself wasn't bad.  Portion size was decent.  The plate also comes with some lettuce/tomato and sour cream.  

Was there fusion?  Yeah.  The chicken was grilled chicken, but I did not taste any Asian in it.  I'd love to try this place next time and try something more with Asian fusion to it."}
{"text":"We ended up at this location after trying to go to the Rainbow location and finding that it's closed on Mondays. Despite the drive we enjoyed our meal. Solidly good food for a great value! Chips with guac and salsa to start you off. 
Bulgogi rice bowl - their version of bibimbop; perfectly cooked egg and delicious Korean hot sauce to go with it
Pork, chicken, and beef tacos - nicely marinated meats
Full order of fusion fries- their version of carne Asada fries; sauce adds a nice sweetness"}
{"text":"The staff is lovely at the buffalo location. 
5% off for cash payment 
Reasonable prices, about $8/person
This is the place to go if you want to try something new! We ordered spam musubi with egg, fusion nachos and the kimchi fried rice. All of it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty good fusion. Found it on yelp when we couldn't decide where to eat when we got to Vegas. The Bulgolgi fries and bibimbap was great and the grilled cheeze. I'll come here again next time I go to Vegas. When you can't decide on Asian or Mexican. This place is a good spot."}
{"text":"Shockingly Decent,

This place is an obvious hole in the wall kitchen eatery type joint.
Meats are cooked and seasoned nicely.
Rice is kept nicely steamed.
Prices are reasonable.
Lousy Location, little hard to find because its dark.

Thier kimchi could be better, and when you're done eating.  
Throw it out immediately, because Korean spices spoil easily and smell super foul.  So eat it and trash it right away."}
{"text":"I had the bulgolgi taco and fries for ~11. 

- Taco was savory! i enjoyed the kimchi substitute. 
- Fries are creative yet too sweet. I prefer the regular carne asada fries. 
- Pricing is very reasonable.
- Great service. I was delighted to find out that the bottle of water was free of charge!

^____^!"}
{"text":"KoMex was a good meal at a good value but with he value always comes the q2uaity. Don't get me wrong the sauce is AMAZING but didn't like the amount of greasy coming from the nachos or the fries."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I ordered way too much, but I enjoyed every single last bite.
The chips - homemade, refried every other hour but they're not oily at all, I could eat them forever
The tacos - they're fat, you definitely get your money's worth. The meat is tender, packed with flavor, these are great tacos.
Wonton soup - It tastes somewhat different from your usual takeout wonton soup, has a Korean twist to the flavor of the broth. It's refreshing, wontons taste great.
Kimchi Fried Rice - It's not fried, most likely done in a rice container. Still, it tastes amazing. 
Bulgogi Sliders - The marinade for the beef is sweet, but not too sweet that you can't finish the dish. It's sweeter than what I'm used to, but these are definitely good to try out.

Server, who is also the owner, handles multiple tables flawlessly, doesn't mess up a single order. She keeps water filled, always makes sure we're enjoying everything she's served. Pleasant."}
{"text":"The first time I went to KoMex, I thought maybe I made a mistake. The area and the exterior looked kind of iffy but when I got inside, it was packed!  So, I decided to stay and a friendly hostess showed me to my table.  I had the bulgogi, daeji and dak gogi tacos plus a side of bulgogi fries.  They were all flavorful.  The bulgogi fries can feed 2 very hungry peeps.  Imagine a pile of crispy golden fries topped with melted cheese, jalapenos, hot sauce and bulgogi...sweet, savory, spicy all in one. YUUUUMMMM!!!  

My next visits, I tried the calamari tacos (tender calamari, lightly breaded) and my KoMex favorite: bulgogi chimichanga.  It's incredibly cheesy, crispy, meaty and tasty.  It may be a bit oily but it's alright.  Just thinking about it is making me hungry.

Great service, amazing food at very affordable prices.  You get chips, salsa and guac for free.  At the end of your meal, you get fortune cookies and sliced oranges speared with little plastic swords.  It's Korean, it's Mexican...it's KoMex!!!"}
{"text":"Got the Kimchi friedrice 3 meat combo.. its pretty good.. one of the spot i go to when craving for that korean/spanish food.. lol"}
{"text":"Im going to try to put this into words...because truly there are no words to describe the awesomeness of KoMex. 

First off, we showed up basically at closing and the owners let us dine in and were incredibly nice. This was exactly what I was looking for, a diamond in the rough. I love little joints that are tucked away that just blow your mind. This needs to be on Diners drive ins and dives. Guy would love this place! 

We ordered a bulgogi burrito and quesadilla and pork tacos. The burrito was honestly hands down the best burrito I have ever had...ever. Everything about it was great the meat was well marinated and full of flavor. Tacos were intoxicating and same goes for the quesadilla. We could taste the passion within every bite of every dish. Its easy to see that they have a lot of pride within their food. 

They are located in a little shopping center and could be easily missed if youre from out of town and dont have GPS. Inside is plain but decorated with newspaper and magazine articles notating KoMex's awesomeness. Honestly who cares about what this place looks like its all about the food here. 

I recommend KoMex to anyone and everyone. Its only about 15 mins from the strip and worth it. I would drive any distance to get to Komex. 

I want to thank the owner who I never got the name of for letting us eat right at closing. It was very nice meeting you and we enjoyed the conversation after our meal. PLEASE OPEN A KOMEX IN CALIFORNIA! If not we will be back soon! Any time im in vegas i am going to KoMex, new tradition."}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch, but parking is limited. Had a full plate of beef with fettuccine noodles and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place has all the potential to be great. I loved in Korea for a couple years and love the food. Komex has some really great picks and some mediocre ones too.
I've always enjoyed the bulgogi burrito. The kimchi fried rice is just ok. The tater tots are way too much. Fried potatoes combined with cheese, bacon, bulgogi and pork belly=3 bites and you are done. Too much grease and fat. I might be making the case for some people on those. 
If you go here, stick to the classics as those seem to be the best. Some of the fusion doesn't quite work. 
Bulgogi burrito though= 5 stars"}
{"text":"At first me and my boyfriend didn't find this place appealing but we went ahead and gave it a shot and I'm glad we did! They give out free chips and salsa/guan and an orange for dessert  we got the spicy pork chimichanga and it was pretty delish! It wasn't AMAZING but I would order it again. Must try this place!!"}
{"text":"After a few months have passed by I feel the need to update.. at first I was like hmm.. it's good but lacks the flavor of a TRADITIONAL burrito. This is anything but.. and I've cravings for this delicious burrito time and time again. It's perfect for one of those times where you're like, \"Should I get Korean or Mexican?..\" with KoMex you can have BOTH!"}
{"text":"WOW! Where do I begin? BOMB DOT COM !!
My good friend and food aficionado, Mr. P, suggested this spot while I was out in Vegas. On our way home (but not really on the way to Cali), we made it a point to try it out. I gotta say, this will be a mandatory visit each time I come out here! Komex lived up to all the hype on Yelp. 

The place is small and doesn't seat too many, so I would suggest arriving with enough time to cover this, just in case. When we got there, it was full and we waited in line for about 20 minutes to be seated. After being seated, we waited another 10 minutes to get our order in. The staff were super busy working nonstop the entire time and noticing this, I see that the wait is part of the visit. Don't hold that against them. 

As for the food...mmmm...made to order...mmmm...fresh...mmmm...OK, back to the review...So, you get an order of chips, salsa and guacamole after you order. Tasty and good. 

- Spicy pork taco for $2 was awesome! Not so spicy though, so don't worry. 
-  Bulgogi Nachos was the business! You HAVE to try this out. The Bulgogi meat is more of a teriyaki beef type, sweetened, tender and juicy. A nice pico de gallo blend on top and some beans and mozzarella cheese! This was a mouthful of flavor in each bite. 
- Shrimp fried rice was sooo good!! Some of the best I've had
-  Bulgogi chicken and rice was fantastic, says my 18 y/o daughter
-  Carne asada taco eaten by my 5 year old didn't stand a chance. He said he loved it.
-  Enchilada plate eaten by my 11 year old looked good too
-  Spam Musubi was just as good as the rest of it, says my 15 y/o daughter. You get 2 fat \"rolls\" in 1 order

As you can see, we ordered a lot of food and each of us were more than happy with what we had...We also had enough to take some for the ride home. 

Overall, arrive early, have patience, the portions are big, the price is small and the flavor is incredible. ...And the staff is busy making your food! I see that they are in the process of expanding and hope we get one in Cali..."}
{"text":"Unexpected flavors at an unassuming place! I am definitely glad I went out my way to come and try Komex. This 'hole in the wall' offers a unique blend of flavors and textures and delivers foods sure to please (and surprise) your taste buds. 

Not only is the food awesome, but the service is amazing.  The lady who took care of me today (the owner I'd assume) greeted me with a smile and, being my first time, was welcoming and recommended some amazing dishes. 

I tried the bulgogi, pork and shrimp tacos and they were all very good. In fact, I got a second shrimp taco due to its amazing flavor. I also ordered fried pork wontons which were freshly fried and the pork was juicy and flavorful. Do yourself a favor and come try this place."}
{"text":"KoMex is great!!!  

I don't review restaurants much but had to give a shout-out to this wonderful little spot.
Great tasting food at a reasonable price.  You have to appreciate that.

Unfortunately, this place is 5 hour drive from my home, but will definately stop by next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm soo glad we tried this place. At first i was like\" korean-mexican food sounds gross\" but my curiosity got the best of me.   And i don't regret it now. We loved it.  They definitely have our business til forever,  we are sooo going back. We tried the fusion beef tacos and the chicken broccoli.   The food was so good and the price is just right.  
I totally recommend this place to everyone, especially if you r looking for a new place to go eat."}
{"text":"I was hoping that komex would be really good but to me it was just okay. My friend tho did really like it but I didn't find it to be outstanding. The reviews seem overrated. In Los Angeles tons of fusion tacos places.
I  ordered the beef chow fettuccini the flavor was decent but way over salty in my opinion if it was so salty I would have enjoyed it more. I also didn't find the bulgogi in the fettuccini that great. 

I also ordered a beef fusion taco and a pork belly taco, again it was okay I found  the meats we're bit dry in the taco. Honestly I have made better fusion taco using Korean marinated  beef short ribs and then adding guacamole, sour cream and siracha with cucumbers. 

My friend ordered a chicken fusion french fries that was not bad. 

I may go back and try something else what I oredered I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Ken was an amazing host/server, the food was fresh and delicious. Very peaceful and friendly environment. The pork belly tacos and chicken chimachangas are killer! And Im in love with their korean sweet hot sauce! Definitely coming back! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"What is the best way to get an Asian to eat Mexican food? Make it fusion with Korean. After a few years of working in a Mexican and then a Southwestern restaurant, Mexican is usually lower on my list of favorite cuisines. 

With Komex, they definitely change that mindset. For $2, you will get a taco that is stuffed full of meat, veggies, and ask for kimchi. If you are trying to go lighter, the option of a lettuce wrap instead of tortillas can be done. The bulgogi is my favorite to put into or onto anything. Tacos... BULGOGI!... Nachos... BULGOGI! It does not matter, bulgogi needs to go on it."}
{"text":"I can not stop thinking about this place!
 Instead of trying to get you to relive my experience I'm just going to give you the reasons why you need to get up and go.

1. Check in deals
2. Free chips with salsa and guac
3. Food is awesome (Love the tacos!) 
4. Cheap!
5. Veggie options
6. The lady who owns it is super nice"}
{"text":"On a whim I decided to try this place because yelp tagged it as vegetarian friendly. First of all, my GPS was unable to find this place, and kept making my destination somewhere on Yale St. which is in the super ghetto. Finally, I came to my senses and just read the address and decided it would be right off Decatur...which it is. So even though its located in the vicinity of the ghetto, its on the main drag so its easy to find.

After using Yelp for a while, I find its most helpful in finding \"Diamond in the rough\" restaurants that you would never have gone to if it had not been for some random review that really got you excited about some random type of food. The best experiences ive had are at some hole in the wall places that have great service and great food. If this is the experience you are looking for, then KoMex is certainly up your alley.

For a while, i've actually wanted to go to China Poblano (Asian Mexican Fusion) in the Cosmopolitan. Even though it is massively overpriced, everyone says its worth it because the entire idea of an asian mexican fusion place is just so entirely ground breaking. Even some random food network talking head said so. While reading the reviews of China Poblano, I find the same sentiment. \"Its not that great food wise, but wow! what a great idea!\"

KoMex, I believe, is everything China Poblano should have been. KoMex is cheap, innovative, and, most importantly, the food is great! I got the Vegetarian fusion stir-fry burrito and I can't stop thinking about when I can somehow work in another trip to North Decatur to get it again.

KoMex Fusion Express is definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"Alright this place is a definite regular go to for me and my companions for primarily two reasons 1) food is deeeelicious 2) prices are super duper reasonable. 

First, after you order, you get complimentary chips with salsa and guac, which is already hard to not like. Also, while, I haven't tried everything on their menu--recently, they added more to their repertoire including pork belly spam musubi, which was really really tasty. The pork belly was just the right amount of stomach fat (sorry if that sounds unappetizing) and meat, and cooked so that it was slightly crispy on the edges, but still able to melt in your mouth alongside a bite full of rice and seaweed. Other than that, my go to's are usually the fusion tacos, or fusion---anything and I usually get the spicy pork. The bulgogi is good, but it's a little to sweet for me, so I opt for the pork, which is just the right amount of heat. Also, another fave of mine to add onto everything is their homemade chili sauce thing? I'm not sure what it is? But it has bits of, what looks like, kimchi and chili paste and it hits the spot every time! 

The only critique I have is.....they don't serve alcohol LOL. Not that I'm an avid drinker, but sometimes it'd be nice to have an ice cold beer while eating my Korean-Mexican fusion tacos. 

Lastly...if you, like myself, drink water/non-sugary drinks like a camel, I recommend ordering regular ice tea. It's less than $2, I think, and the glass is way huger with unlimited refills...and for some reason they refill these faster!"}
{"text":"This was really good. I reccomend the tacos. It's basically Korean seasoned beef on a taco. Disclaimer I really like Mexican food and have also liked Korean food the few times I've had it."}
{"text":"Awesome is overused; however, in this case, it's wholly true.   I'm only rating the food here... which totally deserves 5 stars (the location is a bit of a dive, but the food TOTALLY made up for that!)

I had the double-meat Bulgogi plate with beef and chicken, no rice and steamed veggies, and it was absolutely perfect for the slow-carb lifestyle I'm leading. Both the beef and chicken Bulgogi were perfectly cooked (i.e.: not dry and nasty), moist and tender and FULL of awesome flavor. The veggies were also perfectly al dente (not mush/not raw), tasting deliciously fresh and with just enough crunch to satisfy. 

My friend had the Bulgogi beef burrito...
and damn that was more than a little epic! Bulgogi stuffed inside a flour tortilla, with rice and cheese, and then topped with salsa... Damn fine! 

There was a selection of Korean and Mexican sauces and salsas to choose from, each of them wonderful; not too spicy, but with enough of a zip to your your attention. All full-bodied in their flavor, and did not disappoint

I highly recommend this establishment, for comfort food as well as for low-carb lifestylers ."}
{"text":"Yes I'm updating but keeping the same rating.   Man has this place really gotten busy since the time they opened!   Came back to dine-in for the first time in over a year, and there was a 10-15 minute wait, and this was later in the afternoon (1:30).  Service was friendly, but they really could have used more help.  The waitress seemed a little frantic and it seemed like several people were at all times trying to get her attention.

The food was as good as the first time I'd eaten there and the price still can't be beat.  Got 3 tacos and a Voss water and it was roughly 6-7 bucks total.   From my standpoint and from what I've had, the tacos are definitely the way to go still.   Choose your three meats and make sure you have the condiments at your table and go to town.   

Maybe their new location will help the overcrowding and MINOR service issues which are the only things keeping this last visit from being a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"This is really one of my favorite places to eat anywhere on the world. The Kim Chee fried rice is at least as good if not better than what I have had in Hawaii and even Macau.  What makes it better is the great staff, thoughtful desert, price, and selection of food you can't get anywhere. This time I also tried a calamari steak taco. Better than any fish taco I have ever had.  The portions are gigantic too. I always end up taking food home.  This new location is super clean and they have one of the best bathrooms I have been in.  You'll just have to check it out.  6 stars."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food is delicious, drinks are delicious, full bar and atmosphere is clean and stylish :) got the fusion chimichanga and fusion enchilada"}
{"text":"My husband and his cousin came here a while back, both enjoyed it and recommend it.  So, today, along with my husband, I am here to try it.  

We start off with the fusion bulgogi fries, half order, which is plenty big.  We have beef, mozzarella cheese, pico de gallo, jalapeno and Korean hot sauce all piled high on top of the fries.  Oh so very good!   These flavors smothered with the fries, well you just have to try them.  

I  also get a fusion burrito, beef, Korean BBQ style, with Mexican rice, green and brown onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, lettuce, with soy and sesame sauce, all wrapped up in a flour tortilla.  It's big in size and flavor. It was excellent.  

The food is so good, the mix of both asian and Mexican styles never thought it would be good, but it was surprising how the flavors just work together.  Now I know this is a go too place when craving spice and a bit of \"komex\"."}
{"text":"This place is a must eat in Vegas. The fusion is so good!! The price is perfectly placed and the quality is great. It has a real relaxed vibe and quick service. I think this may be my favorite restraunt in Vegas, and I'm a vegas local."}
{"text":"The Kim Chi rice is even better the next day!"}
{"text":"I had the carne asada Ko-Mex fusion burrito and it was awesome! Along with it the chips & salsa were good and my waitress was great too! If I didn't live so far away we'd be eating here all the time. If you're in the area, stop in, have a bite and keep this place going."}
{"text":"A Las Vegas favorite for myself and coworkers!  At least one visit to this place is in order every time we are staying in or passing through Vegas.  If you are looking for fresh food that has an unexpected twist on two great food styles, then look no further.  Meals are made to order, and If you are not absolutely starving you should stick with the half orders.  I think i have had just about everything off the menu now, and I haven't been disappointed.  Great value for fresh prepared food and the flavors are on point.  As long as they are around, I'll always be back!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood going to an ethnic grocery store and did a Yelp. I've been wanting to come here for a while now. I had the bulgogi plate and my wife got it with rice. The won ton soup is off the charts. It's not a place for ambience, but friendly"}
{"text":"This was our second visit for this vacation trip. We found Komex a few years ago on Yelp and have gone back every time we visit Vegas. 
I tried the chicken fusion lettuce wraps with kimchi. Very good...I love the red hot sauce on the table. 
Can't wait to try the 2nd restaurant that will be opening later this year."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food and great staff. And they give us half off the bill if your LE! Makes the food taste even better! #bluelivesmatter"}
{"text":"I had there chicken, and beef fusion tacos and a single bulgogi beef slider which were all excellent. I brought home a fusion beef burrito w/ kimchi and it was large and on point also. The bulgogi beef is very tender and tasty. Almost everything on their menu Kimchi can be added if your a Kimchi fan. Good food, give them a try."}
{"text":"We usually go to the other location when we are in town but it was closed for the holidays so we found ourselves here.  We love their complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole.  We ordered the two meat burrito, two bulgogi lettuce tacos and the bulgogi rice plate for the kids to share.  Always good food, good portions, for a great price.  The manager and the waitress were working hard, giving good attentive service.  Probably go again today because the wife loves their food!"}
{"text":"Great tacos!  I mean GREAT tacos!  Been here many times through the years and have never been disappointed.  Whenever I am in the Las Vegas area I always make an effort to come.  They do a great job with the Bol-go-gi tacos and rice.  Their burritos are a good size and you always get free chips and salsa/guacamole.  Service is always quick and attentive!"}
{"text":"First off, I have to comment on the customer service.  It was an older gentleman.  He was amazing!!! Super nice, prompt, and professional.

This place is a bargain for amazing unique food.  We had the tater tots with everything.  I highly recommend.  The first taste is a party in your mouth with the taters, the pork belly, bacon, cheese, sour cream, etc.  It is so flavorful.  It comes in a cask iron pan.  It was soooo good.  I'm still craving it today.  Very good and creative.  Must try. 

We also tried all the variety of tacos.  You must get it with the kimchi.  It makes all the difference.  They were very generous with the filling and at $2 a taco, you can't complain.  It was so good.  No extra charge for the kimchi which is awesome. 

You get complimentary chips and salsa.

I highly recommend.  Must try.  It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Komex is delicious! It's our favorite restaurant in Vegas! There isn't a bad thing on the menu. I have had the fusion chimi, fusion torta, fusion nachos, fusion fries, the pbblt, bulstrami, kimchi fried rice with bulgogi and spam, my favorite the fusion tots, the mexican taco, the fusion taco and the cronut dessert all of which is amazing! We take all of our friends and family when they are in town and have yet to hear one complaint. The prices are also very reasonable so if you like Asian food and Mexican food you really can't go wrong. The staff is also very friendly!"}
{"text":"Friendly helpful service. The food is good. I enjoy Mexican and Korean food, so this was a fun restaurant. They did good with mixing the two."}
{"text":"A little late but better than never, review from visit Sept 2011

The freebies upon arrival: 
*Home made guac/flour tortilla chips/salsa (chips are a little greasy...but can't complain too much especially when it's free!)
*Bottled water....not the nasty tap stuff that tastes like lead pipes

Food...I've only tried their fusion tacos and fusion burritos, but the meat is flavorful/tender....quality of what you would find at the korean bbq places but placed on a tortilla or stuffed into a burrito.  The chicken taco seems like just normal grilled chicken to me...so I would opt for beef or pork tacos.  The portion sizes are generous especially given the fact that their tacos are $1.29 each and burritos are $4.99.  And there's the bonus gift of a side of kim chee if so desired.  

Sauces:
Chinese sauce-\"nose starts running\" spicy to me...they usually put this with every order unless you request the other sauces.
Korean sauce-extremely red in color, but has a sweet-spicy kick...my personal favorite and needs to be requested if ordering to go.
Green sauce-never tried...green sauces scare me.

Ambiance....LOL there is none....other than this screams hole in the wall joint.  This place is down right ugly inside....but the friendly korean family that owns this place makes up for the dismal interior.  The seats are a little ghetto...WARNING: for all those without junk in the trunk....if you sit in the wrong spot where there is a hole in the bench cushion you may get sucked in

Rumor has it they are going to open another location soon along the 215....and for those who are too lazy to cook for parties....you can order party platters.  They give you a big stack of tortillas, big platter of meat, and the vegetable slaw/dressing on the side...so you can assemble them fresh at home for a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic from food to service and as a non-native of Las Vegas they were very kind and the server was very attentive. The resturant is quite clean and is one of those hole in the wall places that the natives know about, but the general populace has no idea about. I suggest everyone go there and enjoy the Korean/Mexican fusion. Oh and please get the Bulgogi Fries, they are amazing."}
{"text":"The best tacos! Pork belly delicious. The shrimp flour taco also very good. Get the kimchi. Service excellent. Worth the trip from New York."}
{"text":"Small, cozy place with an outstanding service , Food was great.. pork belly tacos  were the start, salsas were delicious very homie taste. A must go"}
{"text":"Tried KoMex a few weeks ago since my friend, who resides in North Las Vegas was raving about it.  I went with the Korean Kogi tacos, which seemed like a popular hit.  

They were alright.  I don't want to say they were extremely tasty and at the same time say anything bad.  I wish I could try some of their other items since they offer a variety of different fusion type foods.  

Place is really busy though.  Try to come at an off time if you can't stand waits."}
{"text":"The bulgogi fries and my fusion burrito were very good.  My only comment about the food was that the burrito was a bit on the dry side even with the addition of Kimchee  to the order.  The service was on point and there was no wait.  I can't wait to go back and try a nice taco / nacho combo."}
{"text":"Korean Mexican fusion! Whats not to love? The Bulgogi fries and the quesadilla is what I tried and they were fantastic. I also had a bite of one of the tacos and for the price they can not be beat. Fantastic place and great service."}
{"text":"We had the pork torta, gulgogi nachos, shrimp and fish tacos, and fish/shrimp lettuce cups.  This was way too much food for two people but we wanted to try a little bit of everything.  The pork torta was insane, seriously good and HUGE.  I will definitely order that again.  The nachos were pretty good too, worth a repeat.  The other items we had were tasty but pretty standard.  I will go to this little place again for sure.

11/24/12 Update - Been going here pretty regularly for about a year...never disappoints.  I love it; the fusion pork torta is legit."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times.mainly because we were in the area. I'm glad this location is consistent about their food as their original location. It's always disappointing when restaurants expand and it lost its own recipe somehow. Like somebody in the kitchen started cooking and throwing ingredients from the top of their head.

I don't know if the husband and wife alternates, but each time it's the wife running it. 

Service is good here. This location serves beer unlike it's smaller location. The better reason to visit this location is that it's way bigger than the Decatur one. Makes it a lot more stroller and group friendly! 

Still highly recommend giving them a shot. We don't have a very large array of fusion food out here so just having komex as a sitdown option is awesome for us! And I swear their oranges at the end are always sweet! 

Definitely kid and stroller friendly!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We started coming here a few years back after a friend had it catered for her son's birthday. First of all, I love korean fare and I love tacos. The two together...unstoppable. I love that it's some hole-in-the-wall. People get their panties in a bunch when the spot isn't classy enough. Like hello, you're eating tacos, burritos, etc...how fancy do you need the parking lot and area to be?

I usually order the bulgogi tacos (marinated korean beef) and their fusion take on tostada. It's basically crispy rice with all the taco fixings on top. The crispy rice and all that jazz on top is perfect according to my taste buds. My son orders the fusion burrito and this thing is more like a chimichanga! In other words, it's huge.

We have also gone to their second location and the quality of food is no different than this location. You know how sometimes businesses open other locations then all of a sudden their own menu doesn't translate properly by the time you get it--not here. I believe it's a husband-wife duo. The wife runs the buffalo location because I usually see her there, and the husband runs this location. Both are nice people! Don't have any complaints about their service. 

They do offer Mexican food, but seriously...please do not come to a korean-mexican fusion joint by ordering team Mexican or team korean. Gotta combine the powers and try it out for yourself. Deelish.

Definitely kid friendly, but I wouldn't bring a stroller in on a busy day. Certainly a place on a day when you feel like having some cheap eats."}
{"text":"If you are not paying attention, you will pass this place. It's a tiny joint stuck in the corner of a strip mall on Decatur just south of Washington.  I work down the street and never knew it existed until a friend recommended it for a lunch date.

I had the fusion flautas with beef.  It came with this crazy, slightly spicy guacamole.  It was truly one of a kind taste.  One friend kicked it basic with the teriyaki bowl (half because whole was be huge), and second friend got fusion taco and fried rice.

We all enjoyed our food.  Saturday afternoon and it had moving business of both dine in and take out.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Soo many review I'll keep it short. Good food good prices and perfect mix of quantity/quality Mexican/Korean flavor"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try to place out for a while but never had the chance cause during Vegas trips I usually don't wonder out too far from the strip. Decided to finally try it out for lunch while I was out there. It's sorta a small place very casual. Since I am a pescatarian I was sorta limited to the menu and wish I could have tasted the meat items. But I did try their fish taco and that was pretty good . I order a half order of kimchi tofu fried rice. My boyfriend order the bulgogi fries that was really good the sauce that they drizzle was really delicious. But honestly I thought it was just another Korean Mexican fusion place that many places attempt to do in LA."}
{"text":"I am so late on this bandwagon.  Writing a review for this now is like just getting into the \"Lost\" TV series yesterday.   

Loved it all.  Kimchi was a must have for my tacos.  I enjoyed the pork, bulgogi and chicken in that order.  I wondered what their regular Chinese or non-fusion dishes are like but I will never know.  If I'm trekking it all the way up Decatur to get here, I'm getting the fusion goddamit!  My wife got the bulgogi burrito which was a monster.  That could be lunch for two.  Free fried wontons with a check-in.  Afternoon lunch coma sets in upon completion.  

Corona or Hite beer would complement their stuff perfectly.  Maybe they let people byob?"}
{"text":"I'm usually a frequenter of their Decatur location, but this one is actually nicer in appearance and area, and the food is just as good! Oh man those Bulgogi Flautas, I rave about them every chance I get, and they pair perfectly with the guac that comes with them. Now I want them again."}
{"text":"Went back last week and the beef bulgogi flautas and they are still amazing. I crave them now."}
{"text":"This place confused me a lot. It's basically Mexican food, but with Korean spices and cuts of meat to replace normal Mexican style ones.

I had the chicken nachos and although they were interesting- they were missing a lot of the staples of typical nachos. There were no beans, no normal cheeses and no guacamole. The nachos were also rather bare, and with crap pieces of meat from the chicken. I would probably not get them again. 

I also had their cross cross sweet potato fries and those were good but not amazing. 

Our server was a nice Asian lady and she gave us great service, but sadly for me that is not enough to make me want to go back here for another mediocre meal.

Fusion can be an awesome thing for a restaurant but this one was not the best by any means of the word."}
{"text":"Got the Beef Fusion Burrito that is filled with lots of flavor.  Expect to wait because seating is small.."}
{"text":"My favorite 2 types of foods. Mmm so good. I accidentally ordered a lot of food. The veggie chow fettuccine was that flat rice noodles. It taste like chow mein but different in a very good way. The fusion chimichanga was so delicious with the red sauce that's poured on top of it. I loved how the cheese was still melted with the beef. Customer service was fantastic. The lady was helpful and cheerfully friendly. I definitely will come back and recommend friends to go. Also I saw a sign there from 3 to 6 is half off beer. Might have to take a look into that."}
{"text":"I have actually been to this place over 9 times this year. I actually FOUND it on YELP! Why I haven't done a review?? Idk This place...LLLOOOORRRRDDD this PLACE! I am not a fan of change so FUSION to me is like...DEATH! When I walked into this small quaint place I just assumed that I would have a taco or two and keep going along with my day. WRONG..WRONG..WRONG. My 1st visit I just got every taco they had. PORK,BEEF, CHICKEN, SHRIMP, FISH...they all were great!My favorite however was the beef and pork..The food is always FRESH AND and hot! Not to mention how quickly it comes out.Then the BONUS of the chips, salsa AND GUACAMOLE while you wait?? Whose heard of FREE GUACAMOLE??? I have taken everyone I know to this place, locals and family and friends from California. ALL of them...ALL have loved this place! My friend got their nachos and literally ate until her stomach hurt! It's unbelievable how cheap this place is too! I never spend over $10. LOVE THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Cooked fresh to order, and service by the cook/owner (I assume) was spot on.  Sauces and salsas we all fresh and a tasty addition to the sliders, burritos, and enchiladas we tried.  It's like an awesome food truck but indoors."}
{"text":"This place has a very interesting menu. Something very unique. The staff was very friendly and the food was really good."}
{"text":"KoMex was recommended by a friend as a good place to eat out off the Las Vegas strip and you get the most bang for your buck (I would say cheap, but that word negative connotations). The food is delicious and the portions are huge! During non busy times they serve food fast and is made to order! I can't wait to eat here again and would definitely recommend to anyone that is hungry on a budget!"}

{"text":"We are from Tx and here in Vegas for soccer tournament. Pulled up Yelp and this place had alot of reviews so we decided to give it a shot. Well i was not disappointed, with great service and great food. Price of food was reasonable and it came out in a timely manner. Wishes we had one of these back home."}
{"text":"Looks are deceiving.  Komex is a prime example. Buried admist a poorly lit strip mall just off the 95 and Decatur, Komex has a handful of tables and really no decor to speak of.  Sure they have chinese horoscope placemats and trays of sauces but without the name, this could be any type of restaurant.

Back to the theme, looks can be deceiving and they are.  What Komex lacks in decor, this Korean/Mexican Fusion restaurant delivers in taste.  After reading so many positives and receiving recommendations from a friend, we stopped there late last night and had ourselves a 32 dollar feast.  We ordered Bulgogi Fried Rice, Bulgogi Nachos and Won Ton Soup and two drinks.  

ADVICE - PORTIONS ARE BIG so either split a plate or go just for an entree.  We took a ton of food home.

The fried rice was excellent.  The beef tasted great and the spice was just right.  The wonton soup also packed a lot of flavor.  The nachos were enjoyable and filled with lots of different items unlike some nachos in other establishments where you have to hunt to find the meat.   

The price is right, the food is delish, the staff friendly and even accomodated a 15 person party despite having few open seats left.

Its on the rotation!"}
{"text":"Great little place with great food for lunch!!  Just the right amount of fusion in my enchiladas!!  Service is great too."}
{"text":"For my husband's birthday he couldn't decide if he wanted Mexican food or Korean food.  I Yelp'd Mexican and Korean restaurants nearby us just to see our options and KoMex was the first to pop up.  I didn't expect to find a fusion restaurant with both foods combined but I was so happy we did.  

The food is delicious (bulgogi fries are my favorite) and nothing we have ordered was ever wrong or bad.  This quickly became one of our favorite places to eat.  

It's very small and usually when we go there is a short wait.  They don't apologize for taking time to make your food (it's not fast food) and they don't have fountain drinks (cans of soda or water).  

Prices are very reasonable and staff is super nice.  

I would recommend this place to anyone that likes Korean or Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Korean-Mexican fusion food back in California, but I wanted to try this out after hearing about it from friends. Overall, the menu has decent variety of Ko-Mex selections, ranging from burritos, tacos, fries, rice, etc.

We ordered:

1. Fusion Burrito ($7.50): You can choose from beef/chicken/pork as your meat. The burrito comes with Mexican rice, green & brown onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, and lettuce. Overall, the burrito was delicious and the flavors were great. This is great for sharing between 2 people. (5/5)

2. Fusion Flautas ($8.00): They come in 3 pieces. You can choose between beef/chicken/pork bulgogi, but we opted for one of each just to get variety. The flautas are rolled in flour tortillas and deep-fried with guacamole and cheese. YUM! The chicken was our favorite as it was tender and juicy. We thought the pork was a bit too spicy for our taste, and the beef was all right. (4/5)

KoMex is off the strip and more of a hole in the wall place. Locals love it and I am a fan! The service is pretty friendly too."}
{"text":"This place has some awesome food!  It's a great idea, Korean and Mexican Fusion.  What a great concept.  I really enjoy it and it's reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"I right this as I scarf down the remaining portion of my chicken bulgogi fusion chimichanga, so forgive me if I get side tracked.

There is not much more to say other than what all the reviews rave about.  So for the sake of time and the purpose of being original, I will try to talk about other things that I enjoy about my experience.

It has been nearly a year since I returned from my first visit.  Its not that it wasn't good.  I guess that I was over the Korean-Mexican fusion having gotten my fill in Seattle, LA, Hawaii and let's not forget...home sweet home.  That's right I said it, as much as I eat out, me and the old lady can get pretty cray in the kitchen, no not like that...

Last time I mashed on a bulgogi burrito, it was all around good....cheap, huge, tasty, but nothing special.  It's hard to find good bulgogi and there are so many versions and styles in Korean cuisine, just take a look at the millions of kim chee out there.  So when I grind bulgogi, I like to factor in the seasoning as well as the cut of beef (sirloin, ribeye, etc.).  The bulgogi here is good but not great, for my preference.  It tastes more pan cooked versus grilled.  Again, this could be different for others and I know that if I educate myself more on Korean food, I may have an expanded perspective on it.

This time I went with the chicken bulgogi chimichanga.  No regrets whatsoever!  Again, it was cheap, huge and tasty...but this time, I got a better experience.  Perhaps its because I have tried bulgogi burritos many times, but this is definitely a first on the Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay (R.I.P. ODB).  That is what my tongue screams with each bite lol.  It amazes me how they could even fit all the fillings in the plate sized changa!  Gotta get the house sauce too...fresh and flavorful!  It took me two sittings to kill this bad boy...the second commencing as we speak.  

If yall don't know changas are fried compared to a burrito, so if this sucka was fried after being filled, nice job.  The dish was not greasy nor were the insides over cooked or tasted fried in any way.  Most Korean dishes, or Oriental dishes for that matter (Notice i refrained from saying Asian on purpose...there is a difference), or pretty lean and on the healthy side.  This is a miraculous piece of work combining what you would think is normally bad for you...into something that is not only more on the healthy side, but delish!  Although, I can't say that slamming over a pound of anything is healthy.  

I only wish that Kalbi was an option in each of the dishes, unless it is and I am just not up on my Komex game.  Last I seen, it was available as specials only.

Well the hype is there...more so because Komex has got the game on lock and monopolized in LV, IMO.  Wonder if this would be the case if competitors came through...that may alleviate the double parking and constantly packed dining room, all for good reason though."}
{"text":"I Rarely give  a place 5 stars!!!  

I do have to mention that Ko-MEx is not new to me.  My daughters are Ko-Mex!!!  Seriously.  My daughters are Korean and Mexican mixed and they turned out to be Hawaiian looking!  I would have imagined if you fused Korean and Mexican food you would have wound up with Hawaiian food???  Yes - no... anyways.

Reasons why this place is 5 stars;

You cannot beat the price!  GEEZ.  I felt guilty!  I had 4 fusion tacos, fried wontons, chips and salsa, bottled water... $5.85!  

The fusion tacos really are that good.  Korean style pork, chicken, beef in a taco!  The kimchee on top is optional at no charge!!  A perfect orchestra of grilled meat, fresh cabbage, tomatoes, onions, kimchee and I have to guess but a hint of sesame oil... 

The owner is running around waiting tables!

This place makes me happy.  I wanted to take my shirt off and rub the taco all over my chest...  I wanted to jump up and throw a corn tortilla 2 tables down hitting Seabass in the back of the head!!! ... is anyone reading this???

The place is in a bad location and quite frankly it is a dump - but the tacos were really that good!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So many great reviews left me wondering- what am I missing? 
Very sweet waitress, and despite the grim warning about the wait for food, it all came out very fast.
 The taste is what left me baffled. Everything was very mild and lacked seasoning. 
 I ordered kimchi fried rice with beef and egg, half order. The rice is basically lightly fried Mexican rice with a few tiny bits of beef and green onions. Oily and flavorless. And beef- where is it? Fried egg was the biggest disappointment- it was dry and over fried and no yolk to break :(
I picked all kimchi out- most flavorful part of meal, and left the rest.
 Kid ordered mini quesadilla- huge and enough for adult, served with pico de gallo and chopped lettuce. Another ordered three mini cheeseburgers- again, huge portion with fries. The beef patty was nice, but fries could not have been blander, and not a fan of American cheese topping the burger. 
 Bulgogi tots- another dry and under seasoned number. The one thing my party raved about was spam musibi with egg. You actually get two huge pieces in your order. 
 All in all- definitely a meh experience. Great service, reasonable prices and huge portions. Just wish the taste delivered."}
{"text":"Wow.   A co-worker introduced me to this little gem.  Unassuming place in a strip mall on Buffalo.   Clean inside and lovely people working there.  

Was not quite sure what I expected from a Korean/Mexican fusion restaurant but it was a blast.  The people running this place are very warm and inviting.  They make you feel very welcome.  

The food was really good, served hot and there was plenty of it.  I ordered a beef dish with chicken fried rice and enjoyed it very much.  This place was quite a surprise and I will darken the door here again!   If you want a different meal in a nice, clean, friendly, small little place that offers a blend of Korean foods and Mexican faire, you cannot go wrong with KoMex Fusion."}
{"text":"Korean, Mexican FUSION? HAD to give it a try and holy mole the value of this place and the amount of food AND flavor wonderful :)  If your one of those people who wants a 'fancy' place to enjoy great food, move on and leave this hidden gem to the rest of us.  
While asking a question about the contents of a dish it was apparent that at least one of us had some knowledge of korean food and then we were offered kimchi as well.  We will def be back, HUGE portions we both ordered the bulgolgi and we most definitely could have shared."}
{"text":"Really good food! I wasn't sure what I was in for, but I do like Korean and Mexican cuisine so I figured it was worth a shot. I'm so glad we tried it. One guy had bulgogi and fried rice, it was a generous portion good for people with big appetites. I had a shrimp taco, bulgogi taco, and a pork belly taco. They were very flavorful. The house sauces, a spicy sauce and a sweet sauce, really took the dishes over the top. 

There were some kids with us who happily chowed down on spam musubi and gave it a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Korean + Mexican = KoMex. 

A lot of my friends had been raving about this place I was excited to have finally gotten a chance to visit and it didn't disappoint. We went on a Saturday night about an hour before they closed and it wasn't very busy. Although, it did take a while for our order to be taken, it was okay because it gave us time to look over the menu.

1. Fusion Tostada w/ spicy pork, Korean Slaw, crispy rice \"tortilla\", and pico de gallo - the pork was tender, sweet, and spicy, the rice was simultaneously crispy and chewy in a good way. The slaw and the pico added acidity to cut through the richness of the pork and rice. Overall 4/5

2. Pork Belly Musubi - I had a problem with this. The pork was dry and had very little flavor and the sauce in it was pretty bland. Overall 2/5

3. Beef Bulgogi Cheesesteak w/fries - this was a delicious cheesesteak. The bulgogi marinade was slightly sweet, the cheese was gooey and melty and the roll it was served on was soft and warm. They didn't skimp on the meat either. The fries were basic frozen and unsalted. If you're going to get the cheesesteak I would save the extra money on the fries. Overall 4/5

4. Kimchi Fried Rice - the presentation was beautiful. There aren't many things that have a fried egg on it that don't look amazing. This was no exception. The kimchi was funky, spicy, and fermented in a very delicious savory way, the bulgogi added a sweetness to cut the funkiness of the kimchi, the egg was a perfect sunny side up. Overall 4.5/5

We ordered a lot of food and the prices were very reasonable. We ordered 5 items (I'm only reviewing 4) and everything came out around $45 before tip. 

Tip: If you're a soda drinker they serve their drinks by the can, so if you get thirsty order a water also."}
{"text":"Service was awesome! Although at the time we ate there was only 1 other table there. We were served really quick and our drinks kept getting refilled,

We had the kimchi fried rice with bulgogi, fusion tacos (bulgogi, fish, and shrimp). Bomb! Well priced too. Definitely coming back! Burp."}
{"text":"Korean food an Mexican food are some of my FAVORITE cuisines for well seasoned meat! I LOVE Bulgogi and was craving a Torta. So glad this combination exists. I had one Pork taco, which was good. Nothing too great but still good, went well with the sweet Korean sauce that was on the table. I also ordered the Bulgogi torta which was SOOOO crazy good. I could not stop raving about it. Again, went so well with the sweet Korea sauce. The prices were a tad bit high for just the Torta, would've been great if it came with a small side, but it does fill you up. Service was a bit slow since we had to wait a few minutes just to be offered water but it was busy considering there was only 1 person in the front handling the orders and tables. I would totally come back and perhaps try something new."}
{"text":"Great food. Obviously it's Korean and Mexican fusion. This is the second day straight I've showed up here.  Food comes in at a good rate and prices are very, very reasonable."}
{"text":"We went to Komex this trip...had to try the new location on Buffalo because the Decauter location was closed on Sunday....EVERY bit as wonderful and it was so hard to leave.  GREAT news is they sell their sweet/spicy Koren hotsauce by the pound, so will have to bring a leak proof container when we visit the kid again in April!!!  Woooo-Wooo....book a nonstop flight and do the same....SO worth it!!!  Had the Bulgogi nachos and our normal corn tortilla tacos...my sister, the pickiest eater EVER could NOT stop singing their praises!!!  She was even telling folks on the plane about them!!!  Thanks again Komex for the BEST dining experience our entire trip (and we enjoyed some world class cuisine!)  Will be back in April for sure!!!!
PS....PLEASE publish a cook book for those of us that live in other states and are in NEED of a KoMex experience!!!!  ;)"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't left a review yet! This was one of the first restaurants that my husband and I visited when we moved to Vegas. 

It's a total hole in the wall that can get super busy during peak lunch & dinner times but they are really good at bringing food out quickly. 

The bulgogi fries or nachos are a must and they are so easy to share. 

Bulgogi and pork tacos are incredible! The prices are great. We came here and ordered a nacho, burrito and three tacos for $13.  

I wish it wasn't so far."}
{"text":"This was one of those-- I've no clue what I'm going to eat here but let's try it anyway. My partner in crime forewarned me I would love it. Looking at the menu-- I was skeptical. I've had Mexican before. I've never had Korean. So... Would I enjoy a combination? Who knew?

But oh my-- yes! I had the Fusion Nachos and Fries plate with bulgogi beef (a girl needs to eat, you know!) The star was the beef-- and I don't say that nearly enough. Usually I prefer the cheese and other toppings on nachos-- but the beef was perfection. Next time we visit-- I'll choose a dish that highlights the bulgogi a bit more.

Definitely worth recommending to anyone looking for a new place to try."}
{"text":"Awesome little hole in the wall, this spot has extremely nice staff working here. This is another reason why I love coming to family own businesses they always seem to know how to take care of their customers. 

Food here is decent in price with an awesome taste that will knock your shoes off. I'm a sucker for yummy food that has kimchi in it and guess what this place decided to do? Yeah some genius here thought it'd be a good idea to put kimchi in their fried rice and WOW was it awesome. Kimchi fried rice with some of that nicely tasting marinated meat all bunched up in the fried rice.....I hate for those of you guys that can only imagine this tasty food and can't have a chance to eat it. If you're definitely in the area, I really really suggest you come to this spot and try it out, if you like Korean food, then this place is a must. They also have some Mexican food as well, but if you come here I suggest you try the fusion side of the menu. You simply can't go wrong with KO-rean food fused with MEX-ican food. KOMEX you guys rock. Having friendly staff as well, makes this place that much better. I really wish they would have a place like this is the Bay Area instead of those cheap imitations.

On top of the fried rice, we also ordered the bul go gi burrito, I believe that was what it was called. It was just like the fried rice, but all wrapped up in a burrito. Another thing that was good here was their fried wonton, which were pretty much ground beef wrapped into a wonton (this item is free if you check in from yelp). I almost forgot that we also ordered the bul go gi fries. Just as the others were good, the fries were just as good. All these things were too good to be true and I highly recommend any one of these.

When coming here please beware, that your tastebuds will go nuts after eating here, making you want to come back for more. It just sucks that I live 9 hours from this place and I can only get it when I'm in Vegas.

I WILLLLLL BE BACK FOR MORE KOMEX!"}
{"text":"Oh KoMex, I'm not sure about you!

KoMex combines my two most favorite cusines, Mexican (actually, Tex-Mex) and Korean. Unfortunately, the food at this location missed the mark. 

I came here with my Yelp Husband (aka, +1 to everything) Justin G. on 5/17/14 for a late lunch/early dinner. We've both been to the other location, but seeing as it is nowhere near either of our homes, we settled here.

We ordered a half size order of bulgogi nachos with kimchee, I ordered beef noodles with kimchee and Justin got a bulgogi torta.

Only one person was working and there were 3 other tables with people so service was a bit chaotic and took a while. When the woman working came by to refill our waters, she said our fry nachos would be out soon. I said, \"We ordered regular nachos, not fry nachos.\" She said, \"Oh, that's right. Regular nachos. I don't know why I said fry nachos.\" She brought us out a plate of fry nachos. We didn't say anything because we had just had that exchange.

Don't get the fry nachos. Justin picked off all the kimchee because he said it made it too wet. I ate his kimchee instead (which is very tasty!) 

My pasta was forgettable. We were so busy talking that I don't really remember any flavors, and that was my opinion right after I noticed that I had eaten everything off of my plate. Justin said nothing of his torta but he had basically deconstructed the whole thing on his plate so, I don't take that as the best sign.

I might be back, but our last meal doesn't have me in any hurry."}
{"text":"KoMex...I had so many expectations for you and you know what you did?! You exceeded them. Congratulations.

Delicious and affordable food. Tried all the tacos and a half order of bulgogi fries, my favorites probably being the samgyupsal taco and the fries. They also give each table nachos with guac and salsa in the beginning (sweet!). We asked for more guac and they just gave us some! Free guac is the greatest thing in life, I swear.

Service was great and food was bomb. I can't wait until they open up their newest location near my house! I'll go there all the time."}
{"text":"2 four star reviews in a row? I need to slow down, but KoMex was just that good.

Rewind to last Sunday (11/27/11) - was on my way home from Mt. Charleston and had previously looked up what was on my \"to try list\" that was near by. I'm not making a special trip out from Henderson for tacos, so this was the perfect reason to stop in.

I already knew what I wanted - one of each of the fusion tacos - beef, chicken and pork. I ordered them with kimchi and extra hot hot sauce. (I'm guessing it was Sriracha.) I was also given a free order of wontons, filled with meat!!! for checking in on Yelp! A very big meal for less than $5...that tastes awesome! Finally!

If I lived close, you couldn't keep me away from this joint. Unfortunately, this place is way out of the way for me, but I will return!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I would like to thank the yelping Elite community for recommending this place because I have a few family members adding this to their itineraries for their next Vegas trip.
We ordered a variety of items like their chicken wings and fries which had a great sauce and the size were similar to a Buffalo Wild Wings which is good in my book. Also I had their order of pork belly Musubi which went done good with some teriyaki sauce and their red hot sauce. Then we added the chicken fried rice and the Bulgogi Plate with white rice which my boys loved. My mom really enjoyed the fried rice and she is not easy to please. Now what do I say about their Chow Fettuccine other than it was very good but nothing similar to a chow mein dish from a mall but it seemed familiar which is delicious and comforting all in one bite. Lastly my sister had their fish tacos which she said were amazing. I also tasted them and I did enjoy but I swore I would go back and try their Fusion Chimichanga because I was so impressed with everything I had. 
The service was amazing and the place is just a hole in the wall that does their food right. They sat us in less than ten minutes on a Saturday afternoon with a party of six so we did not lose out on our vacation time. Also this place is a short freeway drive from the Strip which is why we were in the area. All in all a must try and definitely a must return on our next trip."}
{"text":"KoMex is 0/2 for me, so far. 

First visit, I wanted to try their bulgogi and experimented with the Philly Cheese Steak with bulgogi. It looked amazing! It tasted pretty dang good. My problem was, I ordered a sandwich, because I wanted to eat quickly and without hassle. I had to eat the sandwich with a knife and fork - as soon as I unwrapped the sandwich, the entire thing exploded on my plate.

Second visit, I went for a burrito, again, I wanted something quick and easy to eat, what's easier to eat than a friggin burrito? Again, as soon as I unwrapped the burrito, the thing exploded, it had a rip length-wise down the burrito. Back to the knife and fork for a second time.

Flavor-wise, food quality, and service are all great there. I just really, really would like to eat my meal as intended. I get frustrated with pain in the ass food (I get hungry mid-meal, so the faster I can eat food, the better), hence the reason I order what should be quick to eat.Having to just empty food onto a plate and pick at it defeats the purpose of ordering certain items.

One more try, then I give up."}
{"text":"I can't stop eating here.  Low key and delicious spicy food.  Salsa is full of flavor as is everything else.  Friendly and efficient service for a fast lunch."}
{"text":"OK.  In the interest of full disclosure, I have known the YI family for several years, but didn't know they opened a restaurant until I read a great review in Las Vegas Weekly.  I had to check it out on the basis of that review alone, since it was great.

Living 20 miles away, I brought my wife, stepdaughter, and 3 other people to Komex last Saturday night before the big party at the Hustler Club.

Komex is a little hard to find, but is well worth it.  The space is very intimate, and we sat in the rear booth right next to the kitchen.

Bryttni and Lynda Yi are very gracious hosts, and if I see one more post about hooking your buddy up with Bryttni (Lawrence T), you and I will have to have a sit-down until you learn some manners.  

Anyway, the best way I can sum up Komex is as follows:

1)  Huge portions.

2)  Excellent quality.

3)  Great service and family atmosphere.

4)  Unbelievable value.

5)  Low Carb friendly.

When we received our bill, we thought there was some mistake.  We couldn't believe that 6 of us were stuffed to the gills with such splendid cooking for such a low price.

As such, we left a 30% tip, as that was only fair for the value received.  Their burrito is big enough to choke a horse, and my friend Pat had to have us help him finish it.  It makes the Chipotle Beef Fajita look like a snack!

SIX THUMBS UP!

{"text":"Great spot it's a hidden Gem!!!!  Need one in California. We are from out of town obviously so it's a must come to when we land in Vegas!  Get the plate with beef but get a full it's worth the fullness it'll give you.  Truly amazing.  Beef tacos also amazing with the cabbage. If you are thinking of trying it do so!!!"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I went to Vegas for a weekend getaway an decided to hit up KoMex for the first time. On to the review.

Service: 5/5 The second we walked through the door we were greeted with smiles. The server told us to sit anywhere we would like and promptly came to provide us with the menu and answer any questions. Throughout our visit she would frequently stop by to check on us. Very attentive.

Food: 3/5 The food was decent. We had the bulgogi burrito and taco. The burrito was ok, but none of the flavors really wowed me. I also had a bulgogi plate with white rice just to see how it stands against other Korean places. It wasn't up to par. Their wonton soup, however, was amazing.

Price: 4/5 You can fill up your tummy without emptying your wallet. There are cheaper options around, but of course you came here for Korean/Mexican!

Overall: 3/5 stars based on my first and only visit. There are other dishes on the menu that I would definitely want to try, so this is not my final visit nor is it final review."}
{"text":"I love this place... One of those hole in the wall type place with the best food... If you have not tried it please give it a chance.."}
{"text":"Dayamn! I love this place. The place was a little run down and there wasn't a lot of parking but damnit I didn't come here to stay over, I came here to eat! The lady that was taking my order was extremely nice and very attentive despite being the only one in the restaurant and having at least 6 other booths to deal with she was super amazing. As for the food, I had three tacos, chicken, beef, and pork, the kimchee fried rice (huge portion even for me) AND two spam and egg musubis. I know, I'm a fat kid but don't worry I burn it off in the mornings. The tacos were good, not memorable but still did the trick. The kimchee fried rice had spam in it and was so amazing, perfect amount of spiciness and small pieces of spam so you didn't get big chunks mixed in with your rice. If you're hungry order this, it could feed at least five people or two of me, either way it's a lot of rice. Also if you're sensitive to spiciness, then you should still order this but stop off at the store and grab some Tums. 

What I really gave this place extra points for is the spam musubi, wowsa this might be the best spam & egg musubi in the city so far. The rice and egg in the musubi tastes almost like a garlic-y fried rice and egg mixed in that grease and the seaweed holding it together doesn't fall apart after one bite. So perfect. Definitely a fan of this place but if you don't like spam and Korean food but only Mexican food you just might find this place as okay and then ask yourself why you went to a KoMex spot as opposed to just a Mex spot."}
{"text":"Very far from where I live but since I was around the area, decided to try this place out because of it's insane amount of reviews. Considering the ratings, was a bit surprised at it's location and the ambience but you can't argue with good food and good value.

got the 4 tacos with the chicken and the bulgogi, an imported pepsi, and something like a burrito. It was a lot of food, tasty and very inexpensive so I understand the good ratings. Probably stop by if Im near the area."}
{"text":"Split the beef plate with my friend. You get a decent amount for $8, I thought the flavor of the meat was just okay, I had to keep adding more sauce on it to taste better. Customer service was good, but probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It was my intention to find a decent combination of Korean and Mexican food when I visited this establishment a couple of days ago. Sadly I did not find that here. The servers were friendly, and the location on Flamingo and Buffalo was easy enough to find. However, the food was lacking. 

I tried their chicken chimichanga. The only thing that seemed to make it different from a typical one was that it had a sort of shredded cabbage dressing on top. Perhaps this was the bulgoli (spelling?) that they said it would have. The shell of the chimichanga was soft which indicated it wasn't really fried and crisp like it should have been. I will say that the chicken was cooked well which is something of a positive I suppose. 

All in all, I wouldn't give this place another shot. I've had good Korean/Mexican fusion before but this is not it. Hopefully there's something else in town that can do better!"}
{"text":"Great place! It's not fast food but yet service was super fast and friendly. The food was definitely amazing. The portions and pricing was very reasonable which makes it that much better. I would like to go try more food on their menu!"}

{"text":"First time going here and I was blown away! Entered and was greeted immediately. We got to choose where to sit and their menu is clean and simple. Me and my friend ordered the:
Fusion (beef) Enchilada Plate $8.00
(3 Rolled Tacos in Corn Tortillas topped with Red Sauce & Cheese) with Mexican Rice and the Fusion Nachos/ Fusion Fries combined 1/2 Nacho - 1/2 Fry COMBO $11.00 Meat, Mozzarella Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Jalapeno & Korean Hot Sauce

While waiting we were given a basket of chips, salsa, and guacamole. Chips were stale and the sauces were okay. Food came in within 10 minutes and the portion sizes were not too big yet not too little. It was perfect! Nacho/fries fusion was so delicious. You can taste the marinated bulgogi and the mix of cheese, korean hot sause, and pico de gallo. It was the perfect flavor combination. We ate the plate clean ;)
As for the enchilada plate, it was also good but not my favorite. Bulgogi was spot on and the rice was okay. 

Paid $21 for a very filling, satisfying lunch for two. Not bad I must say! Going here more often now!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have nothing bad to say about it. The service is always great and the food is sooo delicious! The kimchi fried rice with the 3 meat combo is amazing...and the bulgogi Philly cheesesteak is the bomb! You can't go wrong with the spam or pork belly musubi either. Anyway, can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"I like KoMex, my husband loves it. This last time I got the wonton soup - so flavorful and an egg was stirred in it - and the chicken wings that I ended up taking home. Husband had the enchiladas and the iced tee; he couldn't stop talking about how good everything was. He especially enjoyed the tea - which was funny, because if he had been offered Mango-passion fruit tea instead of just iced tea he would have said \"no way\" cuz it sounds to fruity, but he loved it!

Food here is pretty solid.  I've had Korean in LA (which is much better back home, and I'm not trying to sound snobby, rather it's just something I can compare to), and the food here is a pretty decent.  I think the spicy pork is pretty good here, and the bulgoigi was just 'ok.'

Bulgoigi Tacos $2 -above average-The bulgoigi tacos were pretty good.  They came out within 5 minutes of our order.
Spicy Pork tacos-$2- above average-Same as above.

Bulgoigi fried rice $9-slightly above average-Pretty good.  I wished they gave a little more bulgoigi though.  Had some trouble tasting it.  I think it might be ok to pass on this if you aren't in the mood for fried rice.

Bulgoigi & Spicy Pork-slightly above average-The portions on this dish are massive!  Big enough for 2 people to share.  My only gripe was the bulgoigi was a bit over-cooked.  I enjoyed the spicy pork.

Tips:
-Complimentary chips w/ your order
-Where's my kimchii at??!?!  I would've liked a complimentary side of this :P

Overall a solid choice if you are in the mood for Korean.  Like I said above, 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Since moving to the Summerlin side of town, KoMex take out has been on rotation in our house almost weekly. They specialize in Korean/Mexican fusion and you really can't go wrong with anything \"fusion\" on the menu.  I am a huge fan of their tacos, especially the pork belly. They are pretty small, but they are loaded with delicious meat and cheap. I am also seriously addicted to their chips, salsa, and guacamole. The salsa has a little kick and great tomato flavor and the chips are homemade! YUM! My husband is partial to the fusion burrito, which is both delicious and filling. We have also tried the fusion cheesesteak with fries and it is out of this world delicious! It is super cheesy and of course the bulgogi is so flavorful. The fries are disappointing but that may be because they are usually cold by the time we get them home. We recently tried the fusion wings and my husband loved the flavor, but they definitely have a bit of a kick. The only thing that I have had that I was not into was the Chow Fettuccine. It was actually much better reheated the next day, but I just wasn't a fan of the flavors and it was a tiny bit greasy. Other than that one dish everything we have tried has been outstanding! If you are looking for something different and delicious you should definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Good food,  good service.. Beef tacos,  kens noodles and a 2 Mexican cokes... Great cheap eats... We will return..."}
{"text":"Hole in a wall taco joint. It was decent and quite average taco. The menu looks better than what the food was. I came here to have a late afternoon snack. I had taco and sliders, which portion was very generous, but the flavor was not as refined. Perhaps, the portion was too generous that i get tired of eating it? I would like to return with more friends and sample other things in the menu."}
{"text":"Who would think that a fusion of Mexican and Korean would work?  Well, it does.  It was fun to check out all of the different options.  The prices are low and the flavor was high...great combo.  I tried four different things, all of which I enjoyed, but the Kim Chee fried rice was my favorite.  

The restaurant was a hole in the wall, but I guess it will keep the prices down if the rent is low.  

I would have liked to see a soda fountain, but not too big a deal."}
{"text":"I'm always on the look out to eat off the Strip whenever I'm in Vegas, and this place popped up during my search. Korean-Mexican fusion food is nothing new to me, having eaten from the Kogi truck many times (as well as other imitators) in the LA/OC area. But I was curious about this place and its menu, so I had to check it out.

The is definitely a hole-in-the-wall, nestled in a cozy strip mall. We were greeted warmly, sat down, and wasted no time ordering. We were served complimentary chips with guacamole and salsa -- all of which were completely addicting before the food even arrived. We tried the following:

Fusion tacos, bulgogi and chicken: bright, fresh, and healthy. This was definitely my favorite. I loved the crispy texture from the slaw, and the meat was moist and tender. The kimchi on top gave that bit of tang to tie the \"fusion\" of it all together.

Bulgogi burrito: monstrous, filling, and utterly satisfying. I split this in half with my wife, and it was more than enough. The ratio of rice to meat was good, and the flavors were fantastic. A bit of hot sauce rounds it all up, flavor-wise.

Bulgogi fries, half order: this was my least favorite. The skinny fries were a bit on the soggy and greasy side, and the cheese was already hardened and coagulated by the time it got to our table. The sparse toppings of bulgogi was a bit disappointing as well. We picked at it, but we were already more than full with the burrito and tacos.

Service was superb. Our waters were always topped off, the waitresses always asked how we were doing, and smiled a lot. It was a great vibe in there. You could tell everyone in there was enjoying their food. It felt like I was a guest at a family or friends' home. We were even served chilled orange slices before the usual fortune cookies.

Overall, I'm a fan of the place. With the fusion tacos and burritos, the ingredients are fresh and not overly heavy. Kogi packs a huge punch with more intense flavors and spices, and can get a bit greasy. KoMex is sort of the more healthier and \"lighter\" version of Kogi, in my opinion. The food is nothing unique, but the ultra friendly prices and service pushes them to 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"I love the mix of Korean and Mexican flavors.  I have had a number of items from the bulgogi tater tots, spam and pork belly musubi, tacos and chips and salsa.  Everything is good and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Lunch was really good!  Fast and inexpensive.  The service was beyond good!  I had the fusion tacos, one beef and one chicken. Tasty!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I remember first discovering this place some months ago when it first opened. I have to give Yelp credit for always being my guiding light ;-) We literally ate here once a week for a couple of months and I eat out pretty sparingly. It felt like an addiction that only those fusion nachos can cure!  The bulgogi nachos are the star IMO. The freshly fried chips, sweet and salty bulgogi beef, fresh pico and a drizzle of spicy sauce is fusion perfection. And who would have thought mozzarella cheese over korean beef would even be appropriate? The full portion is so large I always share, throw in a coupla fish tacos and call it a meal. I really like their version of the fish taco. The shrimp is ok. We've also tried their fried rice. It is extra fragrant from the sesame oil and very welcoming at first, but after several bites and a cooler temp it the sesame smell and taste becomes overpowering. I have yet to try the kimchi fried rice but after the nachos there is just no room!  The complimentary chips and guac is a nice addition to the already affordable pricing and the fried wontons are really cheap and good as well. I think there are 5 for like $1.50!!

Their homemade salsa and sauces are really good
 The salsa verde-ish one is my favorite. Green in color almost like salsa verde but some pungeant asian notes in it as well. The sauce caddies used to be on the tables but now I notice that you have to ask for it. Even then, each jar is only a bout a quarter full. I think some people got a little too crazy and wasteful  with the sauce.  I wish they would add in a soda fountain and stop serving cans of soda. Other than that, I really love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Vegas and wanted to try something new. Korean/ Mexican Fusion is totally new for me. I asked the waitress what is the most popular dish. She mentioned that the Fusion Tostado was featured on one of the Food Network shows. Its only $5 and its delicious & filling! They are very gracious on serving size. I took my sister and her husband (who live in LA) here and they've already want to head out here again the next time they visit. Try it. You might like it."}
{"text":"My first visit here. We came because of Yelp and were very pleased.  They were right on with service and the food was amazing! We tried a few single items -- chicken taco as a lettuce wrap, chicken flauta with fusion guacamole, beef slider, shrimp fried rice, shrimp taco with fusion tartar sauce. Everything was wonderful and the server was so patient and helpful and friendly!  Plus their prices are so competitive.  Our meal came to $26, and we had leftovers."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. I think that the fusion between Korean and Mexican food is incredible. I had  there a fusion burrito with the Korean Beef and it was huge once I received it we also ordered the fusion nachos with the Korean Beef. It was really good. I would highly recommend this place to any one. One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The only thing that I wish they would change is to make there Mexican style salsa more spicier. But other than that this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Went here with a bunch of friends on a Friday night about 830pm. I found it kind of strange that they close at 9pm, but we made it in the door. There's probably 15 or so tables available, but only a few were occupied.

Our group ordered bulgogi nachos, several varieties of tacos ($2 ea), pork belly and bulgogi skewers ($3 ea), a bulgogi rice bowl, and a big pineapple filled with liquor. Nachos were good, with plenty of peppers that I had to work around. 7/10

Tacos were really good, small in size but packed full of flavor. 9/10

Skewers looked great and full of meat. I didn't eat them but I would definitely order them next time because I love meat on a stick.

My friend who wasn't hungry at 3/4 of the rice bowl, so it must have been good. Served with a sunny side up egg on top for $9.

Place is clean, serves alcohol (beer and wine) which I was told the other location doesn't. I'm definitely coming back for those skewers."}
{"text":"Not big on leaving reviews since I think you should figure out on your own whether you like a restaurant or not. 
But you're doing yourself a disservice by not coming here. This place is turning out GREAT food"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, good food seasoned well, large portions.  I am a fan! The beef bulgogi plate and the pork bulgogi plate are both very good and I recommend trying both of these meat plates.  If you spring for the fried rice, it is delicious!  I recommend giving this place a try for a good meal at a good price when you are in the mood for something casual yet adventurous."}
{"text":"After I devoured my meal in under 10 minutes, I texted my cousin (who recommended the place):

\"Why is this place SO good?!\"

Not only that but it's also SO cost efficient after being used to being gauged while staying on the strip. KoMex is a fantastic little hole in the wall that is probably most well known to locals and also out of town foodies like me and my cousin. 

The inside is clean, well lit and full of the mom and pop/hole in the wall vibe. The server is also the host/cashier/everything but a cook so please be patient. We ordered:

- Beef Bulgogi tacos: Wow, just wow. Perfectly cooked and seasoned beef neatly tucked in a corn tortilla. What took it to the next level was that the lettuce/tomatoes were marinated in a special type of vinaigrette that was part savory and citrusy at the same time. I've never tasted that type of flavor before in a taco but man was it phenomenal. 

- Kimchi fried rice with spam: Another fav. When I order this at Korean places, it can get super greasy but Komex got this shit down right. Right amount of spice, seasoning and spam to keep me shoveling in the rice spoonful after spoonful.

- Chow Fettucine with veggies: Loved this dish. It was nicely seasoned with just the right amount of soy and the veggies had a slight crisp. I would order this again but with beef and also a full order!

Definitely  coming back here the next time I am in town. Totally worth venturing off the strip for some good quality local grub!"}
{"text":"I'm an avid foodie, who also unfortunately has a gluten intolerance.  However, I know that Mexican food tends to be safe, so I figured that if my husband and I went here during our trip to Vegas, there would at least be something I could eat.  

We arrived about 10 minutes before open, and I'm glad that we did.  The place filled up very fast.  The great thing about this place is that because everything is made fresh, I was able to verify what items contained gluten.  My server was unsure of which fusion meats were marinated in soy sauce, but he promptly got the owner who was able to answer all of my questions.  

I was disappointed to find out that all of the fusion meats have soy sauce, except for the pork.  The Kimchi unfortunately has soy sauce too.  So my options were semi-limited, but  I was thrilled with the fact that I could still try some fusion food.  

I had the Bulgogi Nachos with pork and my hubby had the Fusion sliders with pork. His sliders looked fantastic and he was very happy with the heat.  My nachos were  phenomenal.  I loved that the chips were nice and thick, and therefore didn't get soggy.  The tast of the sweet/spicy pork with the cheese, pico, and hot sauce was unlike any other nachos that I've ever eaten.  

The star of the show was definitely the sauce that the pork is marinated in.  I loved the sweet/spicy/sesame flavor.  I tried to ask the owner what was in it, and he advised that his brother makes it on site, and that it's a secret recipe.  My hubby and I loved it so much that we bought some to take home with us back to Arizona.  I was hoping to duplicate it, but so far no luck.  

The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because I was disappointed so many menu items have soy sauce in them, and are therefore off limits to me.  But the food that I did have was absolutely outstanding.    

We both enjoyed our meal so much that we have decided that KoMex is a must on all of our future trips to Vegas.  We even wanted to stop by before leaving town, but couldn't due to bad planning.  This was actually one of the highlights of our entire trip and I can't wait to come back, even if it's just to try those tasty nachos again."}
{"text":"On my first visit I had the Fusion Burrito and my sister had the Fusion Chimichanga (basically my burrito fried).  We were such fans we went another day during our weekend visit in Vegas and this time I tried the Fusion Flautas and she again got the Fusion Chimichanga.  

My only regret is that I didn't order myself the Fusion Chimichanga to go.  I'll be going back for that next time I'm in town.  Huge fan of this spot!"}
{"text":"yum. yum. yum. YUM! This place is delicious. I mean delicioso... Err I meant to say . Okay, well whatever your language or culinary persuasion is (providing it's within the confines of Korean and/or Mexican cuisine) this place has something for you! 

I walk in with my mom and we were immediately greeted by our waitress, host, and presumed owner (I'm sure this is a family joint) & were seated at our table with a view of their awesome flat screen showing college basketball. I'm in love already. Oh wait, you want to hear about food right? Okay gotchya! 

Browsing through the menu, they have all kinds of awesome options. I opted for the korean wings with seasoned French fries. The sauce on these was incredible, nothing to overbearing, but a little sweet... A little spicy... With some sesame seed. Mmmm. My mom got the bulgolgi chicken enchiladas. The marinade on these was succulent, and the rice truly ties this dish together. 

Next time I'm getting the bulgolgi nachos or the bulgogi combo plate... With stir get veggies!!!! So epic. #supportsmallbiz"}
{"text":"We ate tony Roma's the night before, it was pretty good.... That being said this place blew that food out of the water! I will be going back Everytime I visit Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is good, I wish I could've said great but they lacked a little flavor... the meats are fresh and the rice was tasted like it has been there a while.. I will go back and eat inside and see how it is.. the fish tacos look good."}
{"text":"Sweetness overload.

Ordered the bulgolgi fries and taco. Everything was soooo sweet, I barely got to half of my meal. The sauces were sweet too!  It's suppose to be a spicy sauce, but there was no hint of spice.

When I think of Mexican and Korean food, I think of spicy & this was none of that. 

My friend had the bulgolgi cheesesteak and she said it was alright, but also claimed that it was sweet.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place, it's nothing near to Mexican or Korean when the flavor of everything was just sweet and nothing else."}
{"text":"I was doubtful on coming here. Korean and Mexican fusion just sounds... no. Don't judge a book by it's cover though, this has to be one of my top favorite family-owned businesses in Las Vegas! 

We came on a weekday night, an hour about closing. Apparently this night they were short staffed, and the place was busy, so service took longer than expected (but of course, was understood). I do not eat meat, but thank goodness they had vegetarian options on their menu. I had the fusion tacos sans the meat, but added kimchi. Even without the meat, the lettuce wrap tacos with kimchi were delicious!

My friends ordered the fusion tacos with beef and pork, and everyone at our table was highly please by the taste for such a cheap, cheap price (I believe it was $1.95 for the tacos, where can you get a better deal than that other than at a Taco Bell or Del Taco?!)

While the service was slammed that night, we were able to talk to one of the owners who, while very busy, still showed awesome service to us, even when we had many questions to ask amongst how busy it was. Very nice owner who is willing to explain everything down to the last ingredient. Will definitely return here again, this is my new favorite fusion restaurant! (That ISN'T fast-food!)"}
{"text":"Sounds weird, tastes awesome. They basically serve Mexican dishes with Korean bulgogi instead of traditional mexican carne asada and the like. They add Korean hot sauce and kimchi to some things as well. The twisted guacamole was some of the best I've ever had. I tried almost everything my first time, the rolled tacos were to die for, as was the weird tater tot bowl thing whose name I don't remember. Go here now."}
{"text":"A little disappointed after ordering the Kim Chee fried rice that I let the owner know the rice was hard. He tried to dispute this with me by even tasting the rice on the side of my plate. I let him know (in a nice way of course) that I grew up in Hawaii for years eating Kim Chee Fried Rice and he uses the rebuttal that, \"I am 100 percent Korean and this is the way mom makes it. The dish is different in different parts Cali, Hawaii, Vegas!\" I didn't want to argue with him but as a reply, I let him know since he let ME know, that he's full Korean, \"Look sir, I'm 100% Asian and I KNOW MY RICE!\" 

Along with that, I originally asked for the dish to be served with Tofu and he let's me know that, \"The Tofu was not good because it was frozen in the freezer\".

I find it interesting that he tried to challenge me on my own experience as a customer. The only reason I am giving him a three is because, he offered to replace my dish and even comped it."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and I love Asian food, so why not eat them together! This place is great because it combines both cuisines into various fusion dishes, but you can still get strictly Korean or Mexican food if you're not into the combo. One of my favorite dishes was the pork lettuce wraps. It was an Asian lettuce wrap but then they added pico on top! Great combo! The beef bulgogi chimichanga and fusion fries were also awesome. If you want great food with innovative combinations, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here. The staff and owners are attentive and seem to care. The food was tasty and good. It deserves three stars. Areas that could be improved: overall flavors were good, not great, the ingredients did not wow me.
I liked it, might go back, and would suggest it at least once."}
{"text":"We love fusion! It doesn't get more Fusion than these tacos and burritos. He had bulgogi beef burrito and chicken taco in corn tortilla. Loved! And he doesn't like dark meat. He also had bulgogi rice bowl-living outside the box-didn't like. No judgement against the restaurant though. 

I had lettuce wrapped beef tacos. Awesome!! He ordered the beef burrito but I ate most of it. This was the best thing here! I also tried the beef fettuccine-not my thing. No judgement. Worth a visit for tacos and burritos!!"}
{"text":"Bulgogi Tater Tots 
(Tater Tots topped with Beef Bulgogi, Pork Belly, Bacon Bits, Sour Cream, Tomatoes and Green Onions)

Pork belly bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich is the perfect side to the tater tots literally.

Great service, amazing food at very affordable prices. You get chips, salsa and guac for free. At the end of your meal, you get fortune cookies and sliced oranges speared with little plastic swords. It's Korean, it's Mexican...it's KoMex!!!"}
{"text":"Poor costumer service. Arrived 15 min before closing at 8:00pm .  They asked if dining in or to go . They were ready to go home. Not willing to make a sale .. First time here and first impression very disappointed. An awesome way to blow off costumers!!!"}
{"text":"While I am a big fan of the original KoMex Fusion on Decatur, I had never dined at this newer and more commodious location before.  After stopping here for dinner on the way back to North Las Vegas from California, I am pleased to report that the inventive choices, quality, and taste of the food sampled, and the attentive service to be encountered here are just as stellar and sensational as one will find at the original Asian/Mexican fusion namesake standard bearer across town.     

The first decisions were the hardest: whether to order the full bowl and platter versions or smaller quantities.  Since I was going to enjoy two dishes, I decided to order half portions.  And am I glad I did!

My steaming Wonton Soup with the almost bottomless stone half-bowl (much larger than a cup) carried a heavy load of chicken broth along with 4 large delectable wontons stuffed with beef, pork, mushrooms, egg and onions.  (The larger version sports 8 such filled wontons, and must be boat sized.)  This came on top of the complimentary platter of homemade Tortilla Chips & housemade Salsa.  When I asked for some Guacamole, that of course also arrived without charge, and was a delicious concoction of avocado, diced tomatoes, White Onion, and cilantro seasoned with a modulated and well-controlled spicy kick.

When at length I finished my hot and very tasty soup, I was presented with a small but heaping and steaming platter of Combo Chow Fettuccine with some added Kimchi thrown in on request.  The Kimchi, too, was happily provided without charge.  Since this entree was big enough to easily satisfy two, its larger cousin must effortlessly accommodate four hungry diners.  

This main was an interesting combination of thick noodles laced with lean beef, chicken, and fairly sizable shrimp mixed with cabbage, Green Onions, multi-colored Bell Pepper, Carrots, and an Asian sauce.  A little Soy Sauce added some welcome salt, and I proceeded to dispatch this inviting and delicious melange of pasta with heavy Asian accents.  Meanwhile, across from me Diane really liked her Shrimp Quesadilla prepared with an abundance of chopped shrimp and oozing Mozzarella Cheese.  She was barely able to finish it--but she eventually did.  

After meal's end we were surprised by yet another complimentary treat: refrigerated and pre-cut fresh orange slices impaled with decorated toothpicks.  It was a refreshing end to a superior repast.

Five stars all the way!  I'll soon be back--you can bet on it!"}
{"text":"Almost six months had passed since I last reviewed this fine little restaurant, and it was time for a return.  I found it to be just as accommodating as before, offering free bottled water and complimentary homemade tortilla chips with a spicy guacamole dip.  I was even supplied with extra guacamole at no charge when the first quantity ran out.

This time I wanted to try new items.  So, I had a half-order of Wonton Soup and a full order of Mark's Favorite Chow Fettuccine.  The Wonton Soup was a simple but delicious bowl of Cantonese goodness.  It contained 4 doughy wontons filled with ground beef and pork, 1 button mushroom, some onions, and a touch of whisked egg floating in a very hot, very tasty broth.  A full order costs only $1.00 more, and contains 8 wontons!  

My main dish could easily have filled two diners, and it was probably folly for me to eat the whole thing in one sitting.  About two-thirds of the way through, I was asked if I wanted a to-go box--as if that was the normal regimen for a single diner--but foolishly declined and forged ahead until I was thoroughly stuffed.  And, my bathroom scale made me pay for that extravagance the next day.

The food itself consisted of a generous amount of hunks of tender chicken, pieces of lean beef, and medium-sized nicely stir-fried shrimps mixed with green and purple cabbage, red and white onion strands, green and red bell pepper slices, some carrot splinters, and oodles of fettucinne nicely mixed together with a very light brown sauce.  The dish just needed a little salt, which slight application of soy sauce quickly provided.  It was a fine platter of multi-flavored and textured treats.  Complimentary orange slices and a fortune cookie were brought to the table at meal's end for a refreshing finish to a very substantial lunch. 

I did notice one thing different from my two previous visits.  Instead of several casually clad 20-something males predominantly in attendance, this time the nearly completely full small dining room featured a wide mix of diners, including snowy-haired senior couples, young men in suits, a technician in surgical scrubs, the middle aged, and a young couple.  The demographics have shifted to a wider audience as the kudos keep coming in for this no longer obscure, cook-to-order gem."}
{"text":"We've been eating at Komex for 3 years...first the old location and now this one.  We absolutely love the owners and the food!  Their Korean meat and kimchi are some of the best in the city.  This is the closet to my mom's home cooking (real Korean food...not Americanized sauces and marinades).  They know us by name and have seen me pregnant with cravings to watching our kids grow.  It's a family place and couldn't feel more like home. 

The only downside for me personally is I wish they had a full Korean menu to satisfy all my cravings!  I just know they'd be amazing!"}
{"text":"We just beat the rush, but the line can get pretty long. We saw it build up while we were there.

Korean and Mexican fusion. Sounds a little weird right? Maybe, but the food is good!!! I'm not as high on it as some of the other Yelpers,  but I still put it pretty high on my list.

So what's actually pretty awesome about this place is that they have ZERO problem splitting checks for you. Unlike other places that say they will but give you this reluctant only-if-I-get-a-good-tip attitude, our server split up our party of 12 with NO problem. Go in, eat,  pay your bill, bounce. You don't have to sit there for 30 minutes trying to figure out what everyone ordered and how much they owe for tip.

Bulgogi Burrito ($7.50)
Pretty huge burrito. I had to split because it was too big. The bulgogi portion is plenty, which is always nice. However, the taste of the bulgogi wasn't anything spectacular to me, just \"pretty good\".

The tacos were pretty popular at our table, so I'd definitely recommend getting that."}
{"text":"i loved their calamari taco's      they were wonderful"}
{"text":"Ordered the Vegetarian Chow Fettuccine noodles ...stir fried fettuccine noodles with bell peppers, cabbage and broccoli. Delicious! Also ordered the Bulgogi Flautas- comes with guac and salsa, the crispy tortilla was my fave. 
And last but not least...also shared an order of Bulgogi Fries- hit the spot! I would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  I never thought Korean and Mexican could be fused. But Komex proved me wring. Great flavors. Be sure to try the Korean Hot Sauce, it was yummy on the food."}
{"text":"Very clever idea of combining both amazing dish. I got to say it hit the spot. I will come back to taste the whole menu since it's 5mins away from me... This is by far a hidden gem and I found it! Kudos to Yelp..."}
{"text":"We found this on a random list of things to eat in vegas.  The writer recommended the Bulgogi Fried Rice (Jim's Rice)....and it was so delicious. We also had the Fusion Chimichanga and it was just as tasty!  Atmosphere was just so so, but the food and friendly staff made up for anything that atmosphere lacked.  The portions were ample and the price was hard to beat.  We're in Vegas for a few more days and may just venture back for seconds!"}
{"text":"Love this place... fast and flavorful! My go to is the bulgogi burrito... delicious delicious  with a side of kimchi. You can't go wrong here. The interior is a bit outdated but don't let that fool you. The food makes up for it"}
{"text":"This place is bomb.  The flavors are great and I love their hot sauces.  The calamari taco was delicious.  The spam kim Chee fried rice was super tasty- a little on the mushy side.  I may come back tomorrow before I leave this town for tacos."}
{"text":"The food is really really good, and cheap. The only problem is now they have more business then they can handle. I've been twice one for lunch for work I had to take a 2 hour lunch because I waited an hour for my food, and we all got our food at different times. Second I brought my girl up there cause the food was so good and we had to wait 40 min just to get the food and the order was wrong and she didn't want to wait for it to be corrected. Very frustrating but both times what I ate was so so good."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that Yelp is made for.  It's a hole in the wall that is faaarrr from the Strip.  I don't even know what part of town I was in.  Thank goodness for GPS.  It's located in a tiny strip mall and is simply furnished.  There was one asian woman running all the tables, and she did a great job considering the steady stream of customers.  We ordered the pork and beef taco for about $1 each.  Incredible how much they gave you for that amount of money.  I was pretty sated with my two tacos, but I whipped my wimpy appetite into submission and downed half a chicken burrito and 1/3 of the kim chi fried rice rec'd by all you Yelpers.  They were both good, and even tastier with the hot sauce (salsa?  kim chi?  kim chi salsa??).  (There were 3 sauces on the condiment basket...I think the other were regular asian chili sauce and something with a hint of sweetness...iunno.  the salsa was my favorite).  I enjoyed the food enough, but am not sure if I'd go out of my way to return here when there are so many other places to try out in Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing Komex on multiple lists for foods to try in Vegas.  I don't see what the big deal is...

I'm half Korean so want to notice the Korean flavor in their dish.  The Korean aspect is very subtle and won't please a person coming here for comfort food satisfaction.  Koreans are a proud people!  We want the Korean side to be accentuated!

Komex does have its endearing qualities: they cook everything fresh and to order.  There is a sign that warns you that our order may take time so Komex manages your expectations on speed.  

To bide your time, Komex offers you complimentary chips and salsa.  The corn chips were crisp and delicious by themselves.  The salsa and the guacamole only enhances the chips.  I am not sure what is homemade--the chips or the salsa--but I loved it.

Service is excellent here from the server to the cashier (manager ??).  Their demeanor relays to you that they want you to enjoy your experience at Komex.

Regretfully, I couldn't connect with the chimichanga.  I'm very skeptical whenever I try Korean or Japanese food on the mainland, and here is no exception.  The bulgogi was added sparily, it seemed.  Looking to notice the bulgogi, I didn't find it in most bitefuls.

But remove the Korean fusion, rating on the Mexican influence solely, the entrée failed to pass my taste test.

My Korean counterpart also thought Komex was OK....

As much as I wanted Komex to meet my expectations, I cannot recommend this as a must-try to my foodie friends from Hawaii that visit Vegas... Mi ahn hae..."}

Excellent food n service..Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.    Flautas had the right Korean flavor with cheese.   Came with nice fusion pick de gallo.    Cheesesteak was a good size.  Tasty meat and juicy.   The burrito fusion was good.   A little dry.   Tater tots fusion was crispy and delicious.  A must try place"}
{"text":"awesome idea! i love all the options it presents. ive been here a few times, and its one of my favorites of vegas so far. most of the stuff ive tried has been good (sadly not everything though) i would advise staying more towards there mexican stuff since i havent had a bad mexican dish. (the asian dishes have been hit or miss). the chips at the beginning are worth the trip alone (there awesome!) will def be going back many more times."}
{"text":"Hidden Jem in LV. I love these hole in the wall places. I highly recommend the spicy pork tacos."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at especially when I'm pregnant. I'm not as daring as my husband, I stick to the Asian menu.  I always order the same thing: Chicken Bulogi, Fish Tacos, Kimchee Fried Rice, Wonton Soup and the Chow Fun. The staff is very friendly and I can't wait to try their Soju-tini!"}
{"text":"Just regular Mexican tacos with the usual meats replaced with Korean meats

Beef Bulgogi Tacos with Kimchi
- dry bulgogi, kimchi had a weak flavor

Pork Belly Tacos with Kimchi
- dry pork belly, I preferred the beef ones

Pork Bulgogi Chimichanga
- topped with pico and the insides were like a regular burrito except with asian marinated meat, also dry

I like where they were going with this idea, however I expected a little more fusion like places in SF or NYC (adding gochujang sauce or incorporating banchan).  This could easily be a 4 star if the food was a little more juicier."}
{"text":"The food is great, but it feels as if it's overly greasy. Nevertheless some quick tips!

1. Parking is pretty plentiful. It's in a small strip mall in a not so nice neighborhood.

2. The point of a restaurant like this is to try their fusion offerings, after all the name is Komex! Get a little less authentic on both sides and try the Fusion Burrito or a chimichanga.

3. The meats are pretty good quality and taste pretty good.

4. For those who don't tolerate greasy food, try sticking to the rice plates as opposed to the burritos or chimichangas or tacos.

The food here is good, but some of the things that made it stand out for me as a poor experience was the atmosphere provided by the place. It's a fusion place so it's a little quirky to begin with, but the venue is so small it feels like you're a sardine a sardine can barely living it out. The other thing in regards to ambiance is that during the summer time, it gets incredibly hot and the only thing that Komex does to alleviate this for customers is to turn on the fans that they have. When my girlfriend and I went, we were sweating like two California piggies.

Anyways, the meats and the overall presentation of the meal was nice. The burrito is big and so is the chimichanga. Looking over at other tables, the rice plates and the nachos are really decent for the price. The only complaint I have is the food feels a little heavy on the greasy side. Otherwise, the service was quick, polite, and friendly. Although I like this place, it isn't one of those places where I'm like, \"MAN I've got to come back.\""}
{"text":"Tried a few things. Everything was very good and reasonably priced. We got 2 entrees, 1 taco, side of guac, chips + salsa for $25. It was still more than enough food that we ended up taking the rest home. The customer service was really good too! It was also fun to try out all their salsas. Bomb!"}
{"text":"Me, my brother, and my cousin hit this spot up. We sat at the bar ordered 2 rounds of Hite and a couple shots of soju. 

I ordered a bulgogi taco, a calamari taco, a bulgogi flauta, and a pork belly taco. 

My bro got a shrimp taco, bulgogi taco, and 2 pork belly tacos. 

My cuz got the bulgogi burrito. 

The chips salsa and guacamole were good. 

The bulgogi was dry and it was not marinated long enough. 

The calamari taco was excellent. 

My bro gave me one of the shrimp from his taco and it was tender and good. 

The flauta was dry to me and with the bulgogi not being marinated long enough it didn't work to me and I had to add guacamole and sour cream to every bite to finish it. 

I think the crown jewel was the pork belly tacos. The pork was thick cut and had a smokey flavor to it. I mixed a couple of the salsas together and it rounded out the taco nicely.


I like this spot!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to try the kim chi fried rice when a friend brought it home to go. So after nearly a year of anticipating the fusion goodness, My BF and I ventured to the other side of town and ordered the Bulgogi Fries and Kim Chi fried rice with chicken. 

It's a hole in the wall shop that boasts flavors and service very unmatching with the decor, It got pretty busy and the food that was laid out on either side of us looked and smelled amazing. 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had their bulgogi cheesesteak and fries. I loved how crispy the fries were. Service was awesome too."}
{"text":"I love komex fusion.  Great servings for the dollar i brought my girlfriend and friend and they loved it.  They serve with salsa and tortilla chips with the order.  Cash is king because they charge for card transactions"}
{"text":"This is my new go to place. Everything was delicious. The fusion wings are to die for, the fusion fries are also to die for and we had the cheesesteak which was excellent. You get a basket of chips guacamole and salsa the soon as you sit down. We had a calamari and shrimp taco that were so good probably some of the best tacos I've had in Vegas. And make sure you ask them for the little turntable of hot sauces because they are also to die for. I will definitely come back over and over again."}
{"text":"I had fusion tacos,wonton soup,combo fried rice and fusion torta it was ok not to be a regular thing but a once In a while its ok"}
{"text":"Good place to stop for lunch.  Nice menu and very friendly folks.  Ordered the BBQ sliders and they are really big and tasty!  I could only eat one after the complimentary chip, salsa and guac.  My son had several of the tacos and they were all great."}
{"text":"Dear Komex,

I expected to love you. I wanted to love you. I just knew I would love you. However, something somewhere just fell short for me. I LIKED you but definitely did not LOVE you.

I had booked marked you as a place to visit many moons ago. So in the car on the drive over to your place of business I was like a little school girl on the first day of school - excited, nervous and anxious. 

We pulled up and saw the long line outside the door and the place inside packed. (This just reaffirmed to me, how much I was going to love you.) Despite the long lines and how packed it was,  we were seated within 15 minutes. 

The menu looked good. I didn't know what to get. I settled on a fusion calamari taco and a half order of bulgolgi nachos with a side of kimchi, bulgolgi fried rice and spam musubi.

We munched on warm tortilla chips with two small containers of salsa and guacamole (courtesy of your restaurant) while we waited for our food. My nachos came out first and I thought they were going to be topped with the kimchi but they were not. Instead, I received my kimchi about 5 minutes later.

Let's talk about your bulgolgi nachos for a bit. They LOOK good. However, upon dissection all it is a HUGE plate of chips with skimpy toppings. The toppings there do equate to good flavor and a yummy taste but the ratio of chips to meat and cheese is lacking. I was slightly pissed off because of the lack of bulgolgi on my nachos. It was like it was sprinkled on quickly as an after thought. If I am paying $6.00 for a half order of nachos, I expect just a little bit more. Why not layer your nachos so that you get yummy toppings throughout? Because after you eat the top layer, you are left with plain ole tortilla chips. How fun or good is that? Think about it, okay?

Kim chi. Is it jarred? And why is it chopped up so little? And kimchi should have some spicy heatness to it. This kimchi lacked in serious flavor. I swear it is jarred and I am thinking you might be able to get more flavor profile if you make your own. Think about it, okay?

The fusion calamari taco. It wasn't bad. I don't have much to pick on about it. I ate it all. However, I don't know what I expected in my head but fusion just made me think it would be so different. It was just two long pieces of deep fried calamari on a flour tortilla with some lettuce and toppings and fusion tartar sauce. I LIKED it, but didn't LOVE it.

Bulgogi  Fried Rice. You win in portion amount. Hands down. It is big just like the nachos. But when the first word is Bulgolgi, I expect more bulgolgi. I should have caught on when the waitress kept correcting me and calling it beef. I just thought she was being rude and didn't like the way I was saying it. The flavor profile in this fried rice is decent. I am a self proclaimed fried rice snob and I can honestly say I didn't have to add anything to it to make it taste better. I just needed more meat. I would gladly receive a smaller portion to get a bulgolgi fried rice. Think about it okay?


Spam Musubi. Oh yeah. This was your saving grace, I bit into this sucker and it was like the angels started singing to me. But spam and nori, what is not to love?

So Komex, what am I left with? Would I return? Yes. I did LIKE you. Will I rush back? No. You are bit too far and just need to make some improvements. 

Sincerely,

Debra W."}
{"text":"Don't come here looking for a gourmet experience. It's not fast food either, it's very affordable dine-in fusion food. They close early and it's out of the way in North Vegas.

If you're looking for delicious food though, please make a stop here. Lunch is the perfect time to go. We stopped by on a weekday and it was empty. It's located in a strip mall and can be easy to miss.

But the food is just straight up delicious! Bulgogi tacos with all kinds of hot sauce. The meat was seasoned perfectly, piled with onions and cilantro, and topped with a selection of hot sauces. It was one of the best tacos I've had in a long long time.

Service is excellent. The hostess/waitress is very friendly and not intruding at all when you're trying to enjoy your food. It looks like a family owned business. I wouldn't hesitate to come back here again."}
{"text":"Today is a day packed with first for me.  First time trying the new Cookie Butter shaved snow at SnowFlake Shavery (get it with Oreo and Caramel Sauce).  Then after dessert dinner at the new Komex location that just opened today!  Ordered the Beef Chow Fettuccine, another first for me. And also the Daeji Bulgogi (Pork) Nacho, possible a first for me again.  Yep.  1st. First. ???. #1? Four 1sts, not very lucky for a Taiwanese person. 

I can also add not knowing about this \"grand opening\" of the new Komex second location to the list of my many first too. Making it a not lucky, but more importantly not unlucky 5 firsts kinda day. 

So I came here after getting some desserts.  One of my friends, Will, was disappointed with the pho he just had at one of the local Vietnamese restaurants.  Michael K was down for some dinner.  So I just tagged along, even though I should have stopped after taking on a Monster.  The real secret to my girlish figure (just for Tu Anh), SnowFlake meal replacement, but you have to have it plain without the condensed milk (exception for the nuts as toppings is okay).

The restaurant is huge compared to their first location, even though it has the same capacity.  The decoration is minimalistic but still Fluffy-approved, a lot of bamboo related decor. 

After looking over the menu, we decided to just ordered two full sized items.  It was a good thing too, because I didn't feel like batting cleanup or having leftover.  Simply put, you get a lot of food for what you are paying.  A definite plus for feeding a family or large group on a nominal budget.

The Chow Fettuccine with Beef was good (just $8.50 for a full order). Nice flavor, but I felt it was on the greasy side.  We still killed it like it was one of Michael K's famous Macha Cheesecake with Strawberries.

The Daeji Bulgogi (Pork) Nacho is big too.  Flavor and freshness of the ingredients are good, I just wanted more of the meat along with the salsa, cheese, etc. with my nacho.

Service was great. The waitress,in spite of having just a tenure of 3 whole days or 72 hours or less, was impressively knowledgeable about the menu and the questions the others threw her way.  Food came out fairly fast, even though some thought we would be waiting forever because of that party of 20 that was seated ahead of us.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience here, food could be better, but still a good time getting mild verbal abuse from a good friend about giving up on liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and possible 6-figure annual income leasing out my soul to Wall Street.

Even though it took over from a defunct bar, and the bar is still there, no alcohol is currently being served here.  Beer and wine liquor license is in the works, until then order a kids friendly beverage.

3.5 stars.  Can't beat the portions you get here, and a definite must for people that wants leftover so they don't have to cook for the next 1.5 days."}
{"text":"KoMex Fusion Express, the name says it all. It is perfect for those that either can't decide between Korean or Mexican, or simply wanted both for their next meal. Not to mention that these two cuisines with their affinity for their optional fiery kicks just pair well together.  In case that is not sufficiently enticing, there are some Chinese (friend wontons disappeared quickly off the plate here) and American added in for good measure.  Did I mention that it is reasonably priced too. 

First timers should test drive their Fusion Tacos or Burritos, prepared with Korean BBQ inspired fillings in traditional Mexican corn tortilla shells or flour tortillas.  Optional Kimchi can be added to the order, but I think it tasted better on the side and not in the tacos or burritos.  I rarely order nachos, but their Fusion Bulgogi Nachos was worth deviating from my customary ordering habits.

This small mom and pop restaurant is operated by a nice couple.  It is located in what appears to be a rather worn out looking strip mall, but don't let that deter you from what will most likely be a surprisingly good experience eating out. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great prices!

They'll start you off with complimentary tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole (Delicious!). Something to definitely try are their Fusion Fries! I like bulgogi (Korean marinated beef) on it with extra jalapenos. Also, their Fusion Fried Rice (Chicken, Spicy Pork, or Beef). Tacos are good and so are their burritos. The restaurant is always clean and the staff has always been great to me. 

I've enjoyed the gritty Korean/Mexican fusion food trucks like Bool and Kogi since I've lived in L.A., and even though Komex's tacos and burritos aren't as good, they still do other things really well."}
{"text":"Love the bigger restaurant, I can bring my kids in for a meal.  Our prior visit was to the other store and we had to get it take out.  Highly recommend the tostada, so unique.  We are really enjoyed the fried wontons and at $1.50 for 5, they are a great deal.   The kids really enjoyed the chicken quesadillas, the chicken was super moist and tasty.  The wings were another hit with the family.  If you are wanting a unique experience and some great flavors, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Wow!  Amazing food experience.  My taste buds were happy.

I read the yelp reviews and couldn't resist trying KoMex for lunch.  It is a very small restaurant so my family of six decided we would do take-out and eat back at our hotel.  It was about a 20 minute drive from the strip about 8 miles away. 

I am a foodie, so it takes a lot to impress me.  I was impressed with the quality of the food.  It was a flavor explosion, like nothing else I have ever eaten.  We ordered all of our food to go and I still gave it 5 stars.  I knew we would lose some of the texture on the way back to our hotel.  I ate the food about 30 minutes after it was cooked and it was still amazing.    

We ordered from the fusion menu; beef chimichanga, chicken tostada, chicken wings and Bulgogi Nachos.  We also added the tofu fried rice.  The flavor combinations where like no other.  

I would highly recommend this restaurant for the food quality alone.  The restaurant itself is very small but take out worked great for my family. 

Thank you KoMex keep up the quality work."}
{"text":"So I stopped in here the other day because I heard SOOO MANY great things about this place- better than Kogi?! I had to try it. I ordered a carne asada taco in a corn tortilla and 2 bulgogi lettuce \"wraps\". I gotta say it was yummy and very good, but I don't know if it was better than Kogi. Kogi is pretty innovative; their tacos have bulgogi and kimchi and really emphasize that Korean flavor. These lettuce wraps had pico de gallo in them, and it wasn't super reminiscent of the flavors I was expecting. The carne asada was pretty solid, no complaints there. But what's up with Vegas Mexican restaurants putting rice in their burritos?!"}
{"text":"My whole family loves Komex, and my three boys can be picky eaters. Try anything with the bulgogi beef. I have eaten at this location 4 times for dinner, and the Decator location a dozen times and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Excellent tasty unique tacos at a low price - couldn't ask for more. Gets very busy at lunch - prepare to wait, or try not to go during the 11:30-1:30 window."}
{"text":"A small little dive with incredible food!  Mexican and American dishes with Korean flair.  When you walk in your expectations are not high, Michael Jackson's Thriller playing in background, older tv in corner with ESPN on...open kitchen with small seating area, typical of an older strip mall layout.
You are greeted at door by cook and staff, and service starts as soon as you sit down, Chips with salsa and guacamole served with drinks. and food is prepared to order and fast. Many higher end restaurants could take a tip from these folks.
We had Sliders with Korean BBQ meat and asian slaw, Masubi (spam, egg and rice roll)
and Bulgogi nachos. All were delicious and would be considered high end tapas at double the price in a large trendy place.
Serving sizes large, prices very reasonable for quality."}
{"text":"Finally my family and I tried this place. We had bulgogi enchilada, bulgogi fries, and chicken wings. All was super delicious. The staff was friendly too. 
The only downside was the place is not in the best area and is small with few tables. Like another said It's what you call a \"hole in the wall\" but it is worth trying."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I wasn't thrilled with my first encounter with the original Komex location. So I wasn't as excited as most when they opened up a new location closer to me. I have always wanted to give them another chance so when I saw their discounted tacos available during their three-year anniversary celebration, I took it as a sign that it was time to give them another try.

We ordered some tacos and a large fried rice to share. Since tacos were only $1 we got two each and figured we would have plenty of rice to take home as leftovers. Boy were we right about that. Our food arrived and the rice was enormous, so were the tacos. For just $15 and change we got enough food for lunch and dinner along with drinks and chips with salsa and guacamole. 

On my previous visit, I had tried nachos and a burrito and didn't love the flavor combinations. This time I was much more impressed with the tacos and fried rice, probably because they were simpler and cleaner flavors. 

I'll definitely be back now that they're in my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"I have been anticipating trying Komex for quite some time. I have tried to come on two separate occasions and have been disappointed that they were closed during my previous attempts.

My fella and I were having a very busy day of errands and were in the area when our tummies started rumbling. \"Finally,\" I think to myself. We are seated and I immediately let our server know that I have checked in through Yelp to redeem my check in offer of free wontons. YUM! The wontons and complimentary chips with salsa and guacamole were my favorite parts of the meal.

My fella and I ordered the Bulgogi fries and a fusion burrito to share. My fella was really not feeling the food at all. He left feeling very disappointed. I found the food interesting but the concept not fully realized. The flavor profiles seem great together, but the execution was lacking the flavor I was hoping for. Their food seemed to lack flavor a little, almost bland. There were so many sauces and salsas to put on top of everything it didn't really help as much to round out the flavors as I would have hoped. The Korean meats were tasty but not the greatest quality or cut and it showed. Just too gristly. I know the price is right, but I'm not certain that the quantity over quality fared well today. I added Kimchi to my burrito for more flavor, it helped a bit, but something was still lacking. I like the Korean and Mexican fusion concept, but there was not enough of either to really give it a kick.

I had high expectations of this place, maybe too high. I still want to give the place another try, since the menu was definitely interesting, well-priced and the service was excellent! I'm just not totally won over after my first visit."}
{"text":"Swung by yesterday with the GF to see what all the fuss was about & we were very happy that we did! The staff was very friendly & answered all the questions we had. Every dish they pulled out for guests looked amazing! My GF ordered the Chimichanga & she loved it. There was even a couple sitting by us that asked what that was & they decided to order it! 

Sodas are canned or bottled so if you're used to having 5 drinks at a restaurant (like me) you're gonna end up spending more on sodas than your entree! I recommend this place to anyone wanting to get away from the strip & just relax & enjoy a meal. You can tell there's a lot of pride in this family owned restaurant & we will definitely go back when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! My fav, is the kimchi fried rice ! Easy parking, great service. Staff always pleasant !! Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Was happy to find out that KoMex has a second location in Las Vegas!!  Have loved going to their original location ever since I started Yelping!!  First thing I noticed upon entering is that this restaurant is much bigger than the original.  Also, they have a bar here!  

Came between lunch and dinner time so no fighting for a table!  Score!!  I am a fan of KoMex because they have good service, are affordably priced, and they make some of the best food anywhere!!

For our first visit to this new location, my wife ordered a breakfast entree.  Well, I do not recall the exact name of her entree.  I think it was some sort of breakfast dish.  I has the chance to try a couple of bites, and it was good.  

I ordered my absolute favorite item of theirs.  The Bulgogi Nachos!!  Everything looked the same, but I did not quite get the same satisfaction this time around.  I was not wowed, but it was still very good.  Flavorful and filling.  Don't know what was missing from making it a completely gratifying experience.  Guess I'm used to patronizing their old locale. 

Look forward to making more trips here in the future whenever we travel to Vegas.  So convenient to have them closer to the Strip.  Korean Mexican Fusion dining doesn't get any better than visiting one of their restaurants.  Give them a try!  More than likely, you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas if we have friends and family with us!!!  Whenever we have a big group with us, we just call earlier in the day.  Fortunately, they've been able to take us everytime!!!  The customer service is fantastic and the food comes out quickly even though they have been very busy each time we go there!

It's located a long way from the strip, especially if there is traffic, but it is so worth the trip!!  So far, all our family and friends have been very happy with the food they've had at KoMex.  Personally, my favorite thing on the menu is the Fusion Bulgogi Nachos!!!  If you are a nachos fan, then you have got to try this item!!  It is the best nachos that I have had anywhere!!  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!  

It doesn't look like much from the outside, but you have got to give this place a try!!  You won't be disappointed!!  Another positive about KoMex is that it is inexpensive and they give generous portions!!  Even the leftovers are yummy!"}
{"text":"i love good fusion.  i predict i will only eat off their fusion menu , but i will always wonder how good their  pure mexican or asian items are. beef bulgogi sliders were my favorite .  i like their chips, salsas, enchiladas & tacos.  i wanna try their fusion chimichanga & fish tacos/burritos. no music/radio.  a unique, rare treat w/nice decor & staff. 
 i won't go here after dark.  bad neighborhood = great pricing"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!

The bulgogi tater tots were so delicious! The enchiladas also really good. 

Everyone was really nice and fast! We ordered a ton of stuff and it was less than 40 bucks for 3 people."}
{"text":"I used to get food here when it was down the street and then at this location when the Korean that started the place cooked and ran the place and it was awesome.  The reviews were so good I thought I would try it since I hadn't been there in a long time.  Food was a total disappointment and the hot sauce tasted old."}
{"text":"Its kind of like kOGI, but different. I recommend bulgogi with anything. Their fried rice is very good too."}
{"text":"This was everything I've ever wanted in a restaurant. 

The flavors, the service, the price, the extras, the creativity, the portion. It was all there!

Our waitress was super helpful in choosing dishes. We got the fusion fries and fusion tacos. She told us which sauces paired well with which foods. 

The food was super hot and was a huge portion. Total for 2 was $14! What?! So good.

They have your free chips, salsa, guac, and a sliced orange. 

Def coming back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to think of this place from the outside but when the food came I realized I made the right choice. I got the chimichanga with the pastor. Had just the right mix of sweat and spicy. I will definitely be back to this place. Book marked"}
{"text":"So. Good. Seriously. So good.

This new location is dangerously close to my bf's house and it has become a staple in our diet. I mean, where else can we get delicious fusion food we both enjoy that fills us both up for $15? It's ridiculous.

My favorites are the chicken fusion tostada and the fusion pork belly tacos. That crunch they develop on the rice tostada is just delicious and provides a much needed textural component to that dish. And the pork belly tacos are just yummy goodness. I mean, it's pork belly.

My only complaint is my breath seriously smells like onion for a whole day after eating here cause of the asian slaw. Good thing the bf and I both eat here so we both have onion breath!

But this location is much more convenient for me than the other, and it's significantly larger with more seating area as well. I have been and will continue to be a Komex fan."}
{"text":"Two words: So. Good.

KoMex was recommended to me by both a Korean friend and a Mexican friend, so I knew this place had to be legit.  I called to place an order for pick-up for dinner for the bf and I.  The staff member I talked to was really friendly and helped me when I told her I had never been there before and wasn't sure about portions and what not.  I settled on the bulgogi burrito, chicken tostada, and pork belly taco since it was a special that week.

The chicken tostada was AMAZING.  It was so good.  I love that the tostada is actually made out of rice and it has this deliciously crunchy sear on the outside of the rice patty.  I'm definitely hooked on that.  The pork belly taco was super tasty too.  I had a bite of the bf's burrito; it was huge and delicious.

Just a note, the hot sauce they give you is legit. That stuff was super spicy, so I'd use it sparingly!

The food was amazing and I'll definitely make the drive to go back.  My car did smell like onions/garlic/food the whole next day and I did notice the same fragrance inside the small restaurant and it lingered on me even though I was inside for only 5 minutes to pick up the food, but that was about the only negative I could think of.  Amazing dinner for two people for $13? I'm sold."}
{"text":"Maaaan, oh man! This is definitely going on the list of places to hit up again next time we're in Vegas. We got the tots with bulgogi on top as an appetizer and I got the PBBBLT sandwich. Gave  1/2 to my cousin so I can also eat a Korean taco . Yes I know that was very glutinous of me, but it was worth the extra workout."}
{"text":"Dood.....this place is super legit! Beef bulgogi burrito for the win! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Simply put.. Amazing!! Awkward when you first walk in and not sure where to sit.  a little sketchy of a shopping center.  Try the Musabi w/ egg!"}
