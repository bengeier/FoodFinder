{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Family run, Serbian restaurant that is full of authentic flavour. Being of Serbian heritage myself, I can tell you that this place is the real deal. The place is itself is clean, simplistically decorated with traditional art and photos. The owners was incredibly welcoming and friendly and were quick to recommend the perfect meals for our 6 person party. We got the mixed meat platter for 2, but doubled it. Despite the platter saying its for 2, trust me, you need more people then that. Our portion sizes are insane, because if there's one thing about Serbs, is that we never want you to leave hungry. Food is everything. We got two mixed meat platters, 2 orders of the pita bread aka lepinja (Balkan version of an Arabic or Greek pita), shopska salad and roasted sweet peppers. Everything was freshly prepared and we were in HEAVEN and even had leftovers to take home. With some drinks, the bill totalled to be $20/person which was incredible for the amount of food we got. 

If this is your first time, the mixed meat platter is a fantastic way to sample all the best meats. My personal favourites were the cevapi and pljeskavica which are small link sausages and hamburger style patties. Pair it with some salad for some freshness, because lets be honest, it'll be a heavy meal. Come hungry, leave happy. Can't wait to return once I'm back in the TO area."}
