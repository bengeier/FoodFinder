{"text":"I stopped in the other day on a whim and left very satisfied. The food was great, as was the soup, and the owners were super friendly (I had a nice conversation with one of them while I enjoyed my garlic chicken washed down with a Modelo. They're going to be seeing a lot of me!"}
{"text":"Great people and great food. Pulled pork, yellow rice, fried bananas,
shrimp, pina colada all delicious and wonderful.  Big portions, pulled
pork has delicious rub on it, shrimp big and juicy.  Everything was generously sized and served up by great owners.  And don't forget
the expresso and expresso milk drink with fresh steamed milk.
You'll eat well!"}
{"text":"Great food, extremely friendly service, very reasonably priced.  A perfect hole in the wall place.  Menu changes daily."}
{"text":"Oh my god delicious!! Service was fantastic everyone was so nice.  My dining partner wasn't familiar with Dominican food and they gave him a sampler plate to help him decide.  It was all so flavorful it made it hard to decide.  My favorite was the pork my companion chose the garlic chicken and of course I had to have a side of maduros (saut√©ed sweet plantains, love!!)...  
P.S.  for the two star reviewer. if you want a/c get it to go and eat it in your car don't bash a place because it's not a standard cookie cutter franchise with all the modern day amenities."}
{"text":"08/22/2014: I read here this restaurant was closed, so I checked it out when I went to Matthews today. It is OPEN for business and tho hard to see from the street, because it is in the 'elbow' of the small strip mall, I went and saw it OPEN."}
