{"text":"PRICES ARE RIDICULOUSLY GREAT AND YOU GET AWESOME AMOUNTS OF FOOD... FOOD IS PERFECT. try the habanero sauce, itll burn your taste buds but the flavor is great! im big on spicy and their habanero sauce is definitly up there in the hot and tasty category. 

my friend and i took a random trip to NC and we were hankering mexican so we found this place on the side of the road. its right next to a dairy queen too which is great cause it was a very hot week. 

i seriously recommend this place to anyone and everyone. it seems like a local favorite too. never was too empty. went back for lunch and dinner the very next day! ;o)"}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled on this place and it was lunch time so in we went.  Very cute atmosphere, clean, nice decor, friendly staff...chips / salsa (yum) arrived immediately and were tasty... we had to ask for more time to peruse the menu (awesome lunch prices) and our food arrived FAST...  HOWEVER... I asked the waiter if the beef for the tacos was ground or shredded and he replied shredded.   Well... it was Taco Bell meat.  And their taco shell was from a box, and soggy.  Not so happy with that at all.   BUT the fresh spinach enchilada (very hard to come by) was done right, very yummy, as were the beans/rice so I was happy overall.  My friend ordered the sizzling veggie fajitas and was happy too.  I am from Arizona so very familiar with TRUE authentic Mexican and have yet to find a place on the east coast that does shredded beef tacos.  Oh well!  Overall, this is a great value, yummy food, great service so would stop in again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Been here about 4 times over the past year and service is not good.  Fajita meat seems like it was boiled. I felt like I was an inconvenience to our waiter.  

There are 3 mexican restaurants on this street Acapulco is still hands the best food in the area and the wait staff appreciates your business"}
{"text":"To the people who are from close to Mexico and expect \"authentic\" Mexican food in North Carolina... get real.  The man that owns El Amigo is from Mexico and the recipes are from his family.  Maybe you need to find out if what you've been eating is \"authentic\" or not.  Remember, their food changes from location to location, the same as so called \"Home Cooking\"  changes from state to state here!  The food is tasty and at at good price.  So... no Joshua M.  it is not going to be like Texas.  Can you say that all BBQ is the same across Texas?  Just saying...."}
{"text":"in the same plaza as food lion & dairy queen...

The food comes out AMAZINGLY fast. 
The a la carte quesadillas were delicious (they use that yummy mexican queso) & were plenty for my 2 & 5 yr olds. The Carne Asada tacos were only OK & I can't remember the name of what I had - it was server recommended & something with shrimp & broccoli served with rice & beans. Wish I could remember the name, it was really good!"}
{"text":"It's too soggy and you add to much meat with your tacos I like there cheese casadia also is you see number 1 on the luch meal they spelt cheese wrong they spelt it cheese."}
{"text":"El Amigo is the one restaurant that my wife and I frequent that has consistently fast service in Kannapolis.  The food is good and fresh, the chips are handmade (unlike another poster accused them of using store bought), and they are super friendly!  I know that most of the employees speak Spanish as their first language and occasionally they speak to each other in Spanish near the tables, but it's never rude comments and doesn't that add to the atmosphere of a MEXICAN restaurant? 

All of our friends frequent this fun and family friendly restaurant.  They seat a huge group quickly and the liquid refreshment is always a welcome ending to a day!  

Go and enjoy El Amigo... they will treat you like a friend."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! My friend and I get Margaritas and dinner here one a week! Great service, great food, great Margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"Waitress is very nice and recommended many different types of suggestions. Beerita is  awesome. Lighting is very hard on the eyes hard to read the menu. Ordered the lunch BTO California 5,99 lunch menu price,salsa not to hot nice mild taste and they brought out a tortilla bowl of Pico de Gallo. All in All the experience is great one!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is my favorite Mexican restaurant by far!  The salsa is unmatched. The service is quick and the menu is huge and everything is good. My favorites are fajitas, jr. special and quesadilla rellenas. Yum!!"}
{"text":"El Amigo is the best Mexican restaurant around! The food and service is always quick, the prices are wonderful, and we always leave feeling full. AC Texanas (shrimp, steak, and chicken) is my favorite with enough food for easily 2 meals! Plan to keep returning often, it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food without paying too much. Service has always been prompt. I would highly recommend this over any other Mexican food in Concord/kannapolis."}
{"text":"This does not even come close to passing for authentic Mexican food. If you like food that tastes like it came out of a can, this is the place for you. If you want food that tastes like it was made by people who have ever heard of Mexico, please pass this by. To top it off, the salsa was disgusting. The one dish that any cook with elementary skills can make a decent version of, and they missed the mark, grossly. It tasted like tomato sauce bathing in vinegar. Perhaps they let it marinate in barbecue slaw? 
The tacos were something they probably find appealing in Minnesota, but nowhere near any Mexican population would these tacos meet the bar."}
{"text":"I have always loved this restaurant. I am a regular here. I always get the steak fajitas. The food is usually good no matter what you try. I wished the salsa was a tad spicier. The servers and wait staff are excellent."}
{"text":"Fast service, consistently good food. Nothing flashy, but good. A nice go-to place of you want to go somewhere casual with generous serving sizes and cheap prices."}
{"text":"I love this place !! Service is always on point and food is delicious!  I love the slim choices as well!  I watch what I eat and they have many slim choices."}
{"text":"I'm from California, so I think that I'm qualified to judge a Mexican restaurant. I tried to give them a little leeway since it's so far from the border, and different areas have different ideas about food, but I've got nothing nice to say. Let's start with the servers and hostess speaking Spanish right in front of us as they're seating us...rude.  The chips, not house made, and seriously, that is Pace picante sauce you tried to pass off as salsa! Chile relleno doesn't usually have meat in it, and should include a discernible piece of chile. The beans 
My tostada was floating in a pool of enchilada sauce, so the packaged shell was soaking and disgusting. The iceberg was crisp though. Avocado salad is just iceberg lettuce with guacamole and a lot of sour cream on it. I honestly thought that the Mexican food I had in North Dakota was going to remain the worst ever, but I think it's now a tie."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices.  I really wanted street steak tacos and the kitchen staff made them especially for me--they weren't on the menus.  Chips and salsa, sodas, and steak tacos and a humungous burrito for $22.  Very friendly staff, super quick service."}
{"text":"This is one of our local favorite go to places. Food is always good and they have the best margaritas around.  Mac and cheese and wings are not typical for Mexican resturants and theirs are both great! Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Friendly service.   Great meal simple FRESH ingredients well prepared!  Great drinks and ICE cold beer!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant! Our server was attentive and kind. Great prices for the quality of food. We both ordered the ACP, grilled tender chicken with zucchini, broccoli, and onion on top a bed of rice (I switched mine for beans) covered in white cheese sauce. The chicken cut it the perfect size. Larger than your typical ACP. I cannot wait to come back! (It's also a plus when the restaurant has Pepsi products, I can't get enough of it)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, extremely friendly staff. I'm really surprised El Amigo doesnt have more reviews. Yeah, they will take your order as soon as you sit down, just tell them to give you time, Be prepared because the food will seriously get to you in less than 8 minutes. 

This will forever be my favorite Mexican restaurant, I moved to Durham and haven't found a replacement and I don't think I will."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've dined here, but I was not disappointed! When we first walked in, we were immediately greeted and sat. The customer service was top notch - from the hostess, to our waiter, to the manager. Our drinks were never empty and our waiter consistently checked on us to make sure we were satisfied. He offered us suggestions and described items we weren't so sure about. On top of that, the food was amazing. I had the arroz con pollo with chicken and shrimp and it was absolutely delicious. The portion was also a great size as I ate enough to get full and still had enough to take home - with a nice price to go with it! Even with a packed house, I never felt overlooked. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place. Everything we have ordered there has been delicious. Service is always friendly. Rarely have we been left waiting and in those few instances it was very busy at the time. Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Authentic!  This is one of the best Mexican restaurants in this community.  The steak fajita is plenty enough for two or three, or several leftover lunches.  Filled with lots of steak, shrimp or chicken, or all three if you's like, the fajitas are served on a sizziling platter with burrito shells steamed and served on the side.  Along with the main meal comes delicious guacomole, very tasty rice and the best refried beans.  My guest had a shredded chicken quesadillia, along with refried beans and rice.  She ate every bite and enjoyed it lots.  The quesadilla was crisp on the outside but soft on the inside with lots of cheesey sauce. 
Though limited on the appetizers, the cheesy bean dip is great with the warm tortilla chips.  This with a icy cold pitcher of Dos Equos makes for a fun, relaxed evening.  There is seating inside and out and when the weather is just right there's nothing like sitting under an umbrella with a large, just right sweet/tart margarita.  This is a great place for a large group or family for it is quite affordable and you get plenty of food to share.  The service is always quick and friendly and the cleanliness is always rated over 100.  So if you are in this direction, give El Amigo a try.  You'll be so full, you'll need a siesta!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite local Mexican restaurant. Sometimes service can be hot or miss. If Ulysses is there, ask for him. I usually get the chicken ACP. Cheese sauce everywhere!! Love it!! Monterrey tacos minus the cilantro are also excellent. Little spicy though! 

Child always gets the cheese dip and rice and beans. She can eat her weight in the cheese dip. 

Sweet tea is always on point."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, wonderful clean environment. Don't miss out on this hidden gem tucked away beside food lion. The food is exquisite and really tastes authentic. My favorite is the fajita quesadilla, although you can never go wrong with anything at \"el amigo\"."}
{"text":"Hey. You like mexican? You in kannapolis? 

You've got a lot of options.

But theres only one correct choice, it's El Amigo.  Its definitely strip mall mexican, but it is the best quality of strip mall mexican."}
{"text":"Terrific food great prices very family friendly. Awesome portions the tacos are to die for. This is my all time favorite Mexican restaurant out here in Kannapolis, NC. Service is fast and accurate even in take out. Keep up the great service"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The service was great. Its my favorite lunch time spot in Kannapolis, North Carolina."}
{"text":"Great food. Always has been quick and friendly. For some reason they said a few months ago that they stopped serving tomato with their dishes as the price of tomato went up. It's been months and still not on the food."}
{"text":"AMAZING. 

Hands down some of the best Mexican food I've had in a long time. Super quick, and friendly staff. 
Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Nice menu, with friendly and attentive waitstaff. Huge portions. Very tasty!

And they have 32 oz draft beer (Dos Equiis).

I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. A steak California burrito and a nacho especial. The burrito was delicious, I'll definitely be getting them on the regular. The nachos were ok, nothing special. Came with a bag of chips and salsa. The chips were good, not a fan of the salsa, it was average at best. Everything was hot and ready when I picked it up 15 minutes after ordering. No complaints about the customer service. Friendly and courteous, I plan on being a regular repeat customer."}
{"text":"Love this place! my favorite Mexican food. I have to eat there When I come home to Kannapolis."}
{"text":"I was visiting recently and came to El Amigo for dinner with my boyfriend and his brother. They grew up in the area and have fond memories of meals at the restaurant so I was eager to taste the infamous El Amigo magic. I ordered the Chef's Special and substituted for black beans instead of refried. Totally overdosed on chips, salsa and queso so when my food arrived I wasn't really hungry anymore. It worked out for the best because my food was way too salty and I could barely eat a quarter of my meal. The beans were especially salty. As in, so salty I could barely even eat them. I don't know if a bucket of salt got dumped into the batch of beans but my beans weren't the only ones that were overly salted. The rest of my food was okay. Nothing extraordinary but I grew up in Los Angeles and we have some amazing Mexican food out here. Maybe my taste buds were on sensory overload since I don't normally even add salt to my food. The service was pretty good considering we had a huge group and everyone was friendly, so I'll give them that! Sorry, i guess I'm just picky when it comes to my food!"}
{"text":"I ate there last year and had glass in my fried ice cream, to this day the owner never bothered to contact me with so much as an apology. The manager pretty much told me they don't use glass there and insinuated I put glass in my own mouth---terrible customer service skills. We used to dine there twice a month at least, never again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good for dine in. Do not attempt take out.  3rd time tonight they got my order wrong.  This time I checked the bag before I left. I wont be going back for take out anad maybe not dine in."}
{"text":"The chips and queso are amazing. I had arroz con pollo with shrimp. I must Say it was so freaking good!!!! I have been wanting to go back ever since!! Great food. Great service. Great price!!!"}
{"text":"This must be THE go to place after church in Kannapolis on Sunday's lol. It was packed. The restaurant is rather small. Although it was busy, our wait wasn't too terribly long. I got the California burrito. One of the things I really liked was the option of a small or large burrito size. The burrito had pico, rice, beans, guac, and chicken. That was all inside the burrito which was covered in cheese sauce. I didn't love the chicken. It didn't really taste like much. Seasoned meat is essential for me and this chicken didn't do it for me. The positive about the chicken was that it wasn't shredded."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the area.  Great food and nice staff."}
{"text":"My daughter had been raving about this place, and wanted me to have lunch with her.  I don't typically like Mexican food, but the food here was great!  I had the Monterrey Chicken and she got Chicken Chimichanga... they were both delicious.  The chips and salsa are good, too... and they brought out 3 baskets of chips!  I usually don't eat salsa because I can't have spicy foods, but this salsa was perfect with just a little kick of spiciness.  

Our server was wonderful... he was very friendly and checked back on us often.  He brought the check promptly and came back for my credit card quickly... and returned just as quickly.  

The place was packed (12:30 on a Wednesday) and all of the servers were really hustling.  I'm a people watcher, and I noticed that everyone seemed to have the same friendly and professional attitude as our server did.  That's always a big plus, for me!!  

This is definitely one Mexican restaurant that I will eat at again.  I think my husband is going to love it!!"}
{"text":"My second visit here..first time was at lunch and another was dinner. I must say that we were very impressed with how fast our food appeared and everything was cooked to perfection! The staff is very efficient,polite and always checked in on us replenishing our drinks. I had a small size Mango Margarita and it was delicious with the right amount of ingredients. We felt the food portions were the perfect size but with the Cheese and Chorizo dip tasteing soo scrumptious, we ended takeing half our dinner home! BUT the best part of this awesome dinner was that we had more than enough and our bill was under $30.00! We will definately drive from the Huntersville area to Concord for Mexican food!"}
