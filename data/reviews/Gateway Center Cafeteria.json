{"text":"Nice café for lunch. Salad bar with plenty of options, hot foods ( was gonna check out but the line was long) and made to order sandwiches (Boars Head Meats) combo (with chips $7.95). The cashier line went fast and plenty of places to sit in the cafeteria.   This café is located in the basement of Gateway Center.  This café has been in Gateway Center for as long as I can remember.  You can enter within the building or by utilizing the steps from the sidewalk along Stanwix Street.  Off Street Parking along Stanwix - pay  meter."}
{"text":"This is your standard work cafeteria food.   The sandwich bar DOES have boars head which is a plus! The pickles are great. The egg salad is good as well. I can't say it's anything spectacular. It's not great it's not bad. I wouldn't go raving about it to anyone but it IS convenient when you work in the gateway buildings. The soups are usually pretty good. Some of them could use some more flavor depth and some salt.   The hot food is also just sub par. Nothing to write home about. I go there every couple weeks probably, when i'm feeling lazy and don't want to walk too far for lunch due to being busy."}
{"text":"If you're looking a bang for your buck and pretty decent food, this is a great place to go to for breakfast and lunch. Also if you work in the gateway center complex, you can get to the café through the tubes which is a godsend when the weather gets extremely cold. No need to venture outside. I tend to stick with the salad and sandwich bar. The hot bar seems ok, but the meals don't seem healthy to me, e.g, vegetables seem to be drowning in butter."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to come if you need a quick and reasonably priced lunch downtown. It's a standard work cafeteria, with plenty of different entrée and snack options. The food was decent and you can definitely get a full meal for under $10. I wasn't necessarily blown away by anything but the quality of the food at the hot bar was OK. Next time, I'd probably go for soup and salad or a deli sandwich.    Plenty of tables, fast moving lines and lots of options."}
{"text":"YUM! As I was aimlessly walking downtown in the frigid cold I realized that I needed to stop somewhere new for lunch! I usually head to the Gateway Center Cafe when I pack my lunch since it's so cozy there (comfy chairs, couches, soap operas oh my!)   Today I went in and decided to try here for lunch. I noticed the giant salad bar with many many options. I headed over to the Entree line. There was a menu board that had 3 options, all for $6.40. It included: 1) Entree, 1 side, drink 2) Entree, 2 sides 3) Entree and small salad bar. The entrees when I went in were: penne pasta & sauce, pork & kraut or a juicy, buffalo chicken sandwich. I chose the buffalo sandwich and of course that awesome salad bar.   Even though I only ordered the small salad, it filled me up quick. I still have my sandwich sitting next to me haha. I added a healthy load of toppings and was extremely satisfied & full afterwards.  Note: it might be hard to find-- look across the street from the Gateway T station and you'll see steps heading downstairs. That's where you'll find this cafe.   Also, if you're a brown bagger and dont want to sit at your desk, it's extremely cozy down there. There are also microwaves (score!) haha!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. Rude employees. Stopped in at 940am and they had no food. Every station was shut down. Why even be open if there is nothing to serve anyone?"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a quick breakfast. Caters to the office complex, so not open on the weekends. Check out the daily special."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I didn't. I LOVED it.  It has almost all the elements I like: fresh ingredients, MTO (breakfast & lunch) sammies, nice, friendly, helpful staff, clean restaurant, friendly, easy going ambiance.  My MTO breakfast sandwich was fluffy eggs, fresh, diced tomatoes, fresh, plump, sliced mushrooms on Texas toast. Hot, delicious, and very filling. And Lord knows, I'm not doing squat without my beloved cup of joe. Here, they serve (drum roll, please) Starbucks! Once I spied the Cafe Verona, I noticed nothing else.   The man who makes the MTO breakfasts knocked out a line of 9 in less than 5-6 minutes. And was really nice while doing so.  The cashier, Renita, is friendly, gracious, and very funny. One of those you can sit and have a drink with, and laugh til your sides hurt.  Good thing they have a punch card reward, because I'll definitely be back.  Oh, what's that one element that they don't have that makes me swoon? Recycling. I'm happiest when I can reycle my containers right there. I put my plastic sandwich container in my briefcase. So, off I go, Starbucks in hand, to conquer the judiciary jungle."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a good affordable breakfast in Pittsburgh. The gentlemen making the omelettes is so nice and humorous. He is also very good at what he does. Had a made to order omelette for 6.00. It was very tasty!"}
{"text":"I love this cafeteria. They have something for everyone. Each day there are three or four entrees. There is a salad bar, sandwich bar and lots of extras like cookies, fruit, granola bars, etc. The staff is friendly and willing to cater to your requests. Big, spacious dining area make it a good place to talk shop or have some private time with someone. Two TVs for your viewing pleasure will let you enjoy a \"soap\" or catch up on the day's news. You may catch a KDKA personality or two passing through. It's worth the walk from anywhere in Downtown."}
