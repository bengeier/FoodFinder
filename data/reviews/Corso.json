{"text":"I just paid $16 for a pulled pork sandwich more akin to Fancy Feast in a bun than something intended for human consumption. I guarantee a coffee and a sandwich from the Starbucks across the path will be both more fulfilling and nutritious."}
{"text":"We ordered rigatoni of the day, pepperoni pizza and calamari. All the food came cold. Extremely salty. It was the worst pizza in my life. Even Dr.Ostker or Delicio pizza from frozen taste better. It was so salty that my wife and I have tingling feel on tongue even after rincing with 2 glasses of water. Her rigatoni was cold, salty ad terrible. Don't eat here. These items cost 50+ before tips and taxes. Walk down the lane and go to paramount instead"}
{"text":"Went for a quick beer. After 10 minutes they tell me they don't have my beer. Me.  Not likely to return."}
{"text":"What seems like an interesting choice in the Toronto airport doesn't live up to its promise.  At every seating place, ordering (and internet access) is by iPad. Nice touch. Ordering works well and they even have a system - that doesn't work - to keep you informed of your flight status. Neat idea but the my session timed out quickly (within 5 mins) so it was useless for keeping me up to date on my flight.  Food is decent; everything made to order in place, so a nice change from reheated staples that comprise many airport menus.  They have a ways to go with their system, however. Food service is *slow*- a real problem with an airport restaurant. Everyone was told the wait is 11 minutes. The person in the seat next to me waited 20+ for a pizza  before having to bail to catch her flight.  I suggested to the manager - a very, very rude and unsympathetic fellow named Eddie - that at very least he should comp her glass of wine. His response was ... rude and unprofessional.  So, Eddie, this review is for you. I can't recommend this restaurant as long as you work there, and I can't recommend it until the kitchen straightens out production times.  For what it's worth, I had a prosciutto pizza with arugula and tomatoes and it was ... fine. Thin crust, somewhat over cooked, but not bad.  Every place sitting has power outlets which is a plus. A sign says you don't need to order from the restaurant to use them, and that's what I recommend you do."}
{"text":"Great location to sit and chill with an iPad and recharge your devices as there are outlets at every seat.   Really nice selection of local craft beers to choose from also. We tried four and enjoyed all of them. Much better than the choices before security.   That being said...steer clear of the food! Not only did it take 40 minutes to arrive (don't let the iPad touting 15 minute delivery fool you!), but everything was cold and fairly tasteless. We both left very unsatisfied on the food front and shared an appetizer (arancini) and pizza (Margherita with French fries on top).  Unfortunately can't blame it on capacity as we were one of three people when we sat down. Our server was very friendly, however, and brought out all drinks asap.  That said, sit down, grab a beverage and charge your devices, but get your food somewhere else!"}
{"text":"You pay for gratuity upfront because of the payment system but the service was abysmal. We waited 40 minutes to get our food, asked for hot sauce, never got it, never saw the waiter again.   I wish I could take my 3$ back. I wouldn't come here again. Too bad because my breakfast pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"I'm surrounded by dirty dishes. Complained and all the server could do was come up with excuses. Never did clear them. Smarter people were so disgusted they walked away. They have a Breakfast Pizza and a Piadina on the menu. I didn't want Pizza for breakfast so I ordered the Piadina. A traditional Italian flatbread filled with prosciutto onion and egg. It was a burnt pizza crust folded in half."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this restaurant!  IPads and charging stations at every seat.  The server was excellent and came as soon as he was paged every time!  I made a mistake on the iPad menu and he made it right with no trouble.  He also took my very picky eater son to another location in the terminal for more food selection.  My daughter and I had no trouble selecting a choice from the menu and the food we got was delicious!  Then, to top it all off, I left my computer in the restaurant when we went to our gate.  I cannot tell you how helpful the staff was to help me get my computer back.  I will forever be in their debt for that service.    So good food, quick service, over and above service (twice!)...what more could you ask for?  We left Corso with full bellies and our devices were fully charged.  The kids were entertained with the iPads for about two hours and I didn't want to abandon them and make a run for it.  Lol. I definitely got what I paid for!  :-)"}
{"text":"Umm hello delicious! This place is great. First I started with the misticanza salad it was good. But then out came this amazing pizza that had me wanting more. It was a vegan pizza called marinara. A wonderful tomato sauce with oregano, garlic and basil leaves. The crust was perfect! I look forward to my next time in t.o. Just to enjoy this pizza again"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 Stars, I would. A broken experience that resulted in a frantic and regretful meal. Skip this place. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"This place is the best airport restaurant I've been to. You order by yourself from an IPad from your seat (every seat has one). You pay at the same time. The service is fast, the food is great, and I can see about 10 gates from my seat, including my own. Highly recommend. Terminal 3 Toronto Pearson."}
{"text":"First of all wraps are $12.99. And there were enough of anything, not chicken nor bacon nor cheese to warrant that price. It was a cold Ceasar salad wrap... And it was mostly wrap (white flour at that)....  It's at the airport so speediness is important. The young lady behind cash seemed nice but almost charged me $119 as opposed to $19 (yes this was for a wrap and a drink).  I wish the line at Tim's wasn't so long. They have a chicken wrap for $1.99 and its warm.  Did I mention that I got a stomach ache after that too?  To be fair, they do have a sit down area and this is what the Pearson Airport news release wrote:   Also located in Terminal 3, Corso is a lively trattoria featuring traditional Italian cuisine with a modern twist. The menu, developed by Chef Rocco Agostino, highlights rustic Italian flavors and features fresh-made pastas, pizzas, salads and antipasti. Chef Agostino's Pizzeria Libretto and Enoteca Sociale restaurants have been recognized for bringing outstanding Italian cuisine to Toronto.  Maybe their eat in is better!"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad, sausages and milk  The milk was half the size pictured and $3!  The sausages were $19 for two over cooked sausages and a few roasted red peppers.   The ordering system charges a tip before you even discover how bad the service is. Strikes me a tip charged at time of order is just a tax that goes to the restaurant.   It was $42 for the worst meal I have had in memory.   Avoid this place if you can. I have never felt so ripped off"}
{"text":"Really do not like the pay and tip before you get to try the food or experience the service. Had the Margarita pizza - it was soggy and just not good. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Jerk server! This little Italian joint has decent food and a modern iPad ordering system but hope and pray that you don't get the 40-50 year old male server. He's rude, unappreciative and makes you wish that you had alternate options.  Hopefully the owners of this restaurant read this and talk to him - HORRIBLE customer service. HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian sausage which was great. But you get two links of sausage and nothing else for about 15 dollars. No sausage  is that good."}
{"text":"Not a lot of choices in this gate area. But does have a diverse Italian influenced menu. Pizzas are done in a wood oven style. The pizza size was generous but toppings were sparse and not all ingredients fresh. Wine selections were Italian and quality selections. Prices are definitely airport pricing. A pizza is 16.00. Wine is 11.00 -5 oz.   The restaurant uses iPad to order-dozens at tables with outlets to charge your own electronic devices. iPads have limited use. Basically to surf Internet. You don't need to order food to use iPads. A nice touch.   Comfortable seating and convenient"}
{"text":"Seems like a nice place to grab a drink before take off. The staff was friendly. There are iPads at every table and station with the menu and your entertainment."}
