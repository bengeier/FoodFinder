{"text":"Under new ownership. The new name is Morgan's Pizza and Beyond. How does Yelp update this?"}
{"text":"We tried this place after several bad experiences with Hawthorne's Pizza which is just one building down from Pizza and Beyond. I am happy to say the experience here was much better! The pizza tastes good, toppings are ample, and the staff is extremely friendly. We ordered a pizza on the phone ten minutes before their closing time (we did not know that) and they never even mentioned it. Their prices are also great and you get plenty of food."}
{"text":"Pizza and Beyond Express is under new ownership.  The new owner was really nice when I stopped in for lunch.  I got the chef salad and it was good.  I have not tried any other foods yet."}
{"text":"This place isn't that bad.  It appears to be a new location near the Red Bridge golf club.  My chicken cheesesteak was pretty good.  The bread was decent ( which is big in my book) and the chicken was shredded just the way it is supposed too. Service was good and I will definitely go back and try the rest of their food"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza.  I can buy a better pizza at HT.  Staff is very unfriendly. I don't see why this has so many stars.  Nasty is the word to describe the unsavory taste. I would rather drive 15 miles to Wolfmans Pizza."}
{"text":"Mint Hill is definitely turning into Pizza Hill. Three places specializing in pizza just a short walk from each other, to say nothing of other places not far away (Bellacino's, Pizza Hut) and still others that don't specialize that may offer it from time to time.

Regardless, Pizza and Beyond Express suffers on two fronts. One is that their pies are woefully small compared to Big Guys. The two-slice special at Pizza and Beyond is barely closing in on a single slice at Big Guys. But size doesn't matter, right? The other issue is the layout. Pizza and Beyond is just in a really strangely-shaped spot in the building.

In good news, they benefit from the comparison to Hawthorne's, who is probably their closest rival. They are almost on top of one another. Hawthorne's easily has the nicer place, but the staff there just stinks. At Pizza and Beyond, they seem generally happy to see you (if you see them - see the comment about the layout). And the pizza is better too. Now about the size of the slices..."}
{"text":"Mint Hill needed another good place to grab a bite to eat! I've stopped in here a few times now. I've got to say, the meatball parm is fantastic! Nice crusty sub roll that gets baked in the pizza oven which also helps melt the mozzarella cheese. The meatballs(great flavor) are cut up into pieces so they are more manageable and the marinara sauce is kind of chunky w/ tomatoes. I guess that's what you get when everything is homemade. It's affordable too. $7.00 gets you the meatball parm, chips & a pickle. Not bad for lunch. I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu."}
