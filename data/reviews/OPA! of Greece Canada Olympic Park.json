{"text":"I just had my first exposure to this restaurant chain, and am not impressed.  I purchased the Opa Platter, equipped with:  - a large, bland potato,  - a mountain of rice (how else are they going to fill your plate?  not with a reasonable amount of meat, of course),  - a decent Greek salad (short on cucumbers, heavy on tomatoes),  - the spindliest chicken souvlaki skewer that I've ever seen (seriously, we're talking about about a series of cubic inch-sized chicken, which was extremely dry - possibly from warming on the grill throughout the lunch rush to expedite service) - the runniest, least interesting tzatziki I have had the misfortune of eating.    Maybe it's because Greek food should never be served as fast food (though the price was comparable to what you'd pay in a proper dining establishment), but this place is a joke.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"We visited this location across COP yesterday. around 6:30 pm. The food was great but the restaurant itself was in terrible shape in regards to clean. The glass at the entrance doors was dirty and the door handles sticky as well as the glass and door handles on the beverage fridge. There weren't many people there at the time of our visit, a family of 5 and 1 more getting served at the counter. The floor was very dirty and we spotted about 3 tables which appeared to be clean. The table surfaces ended up being sticky when we sat down. One of the kitchen staff reused a glove he had taken off.  We love Opa's because of their great food and prices but it's a complete turnoff to me when I walk into any restaurant and I see \"dirty\". I understand that business can be very busy at certain times but food safety and clean is a must!! I have been to this location years ago when they opened and loved it."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and good food for a reasonable price. The gyro pitas were good despite the fact that the gyro meat was not fresh cut but frozen. The serving was large. Made for an above average fast food experience.  August 2014"}
