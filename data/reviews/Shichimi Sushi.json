{"text":"Fast takeout sushi.  Their spicy tuna, spicy salmon and dynamite rolls and shrimp tempura are dependably good - and hit the spot on those nights when you come home hungry for sushi and don't have a lot of time."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place hundreds of times, as I grew up in the neighbourhood. Not once in those hundred times did I go in and now I regret my missed years of eating here. 

I finally went in and had an unbelievable meal and people are finding that it's hard to get me to eat sushi anywhere else now. 

The best thing to eat here is the specialty rolls... located (secretly) on the last page. The Queen or the Banzai are the most incredible, they have bbq'd eel, avocado, mango, spicy sauce, crab, tempura... just an amazing burst of flavours. Their regular rolls like spicy crunchy salmon or california along with their miso soup and tempura are all fantastic as well. The family that runs it is great and their little girl usually helps out and she's adorable. Always fresh and never disappointed. I think also right now they have a 30% off deal since its their anniversary!!

You.must.eat.here. If not... you'll regret it!!"}
{"text":"Place was okay, came here because we couldn't find the other place that we wanted to LOL. service was good, the lady that greeted us was very nice and courteous. food I found to be just okay, nothing super amazing, but pretty dang good considering it's like 13 bucks for AYCE lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered  6 special rolls today, brown rice.  About $70 before special discount.  When order arrived it was quite light, basically fit into 3 regular sushi trays from a grocery store with each roll quite small with little fish.  Brown rice (extra charge) has usually been quite nutty and tasteful from others, but this was more sort of brownish white rice with no extra texture or taste so quite disappointing and not worth the extra $1 per order but what was more disappointing is that the rolls were also not worth $10+ each, more like supermarket $5 except supermarket would also through in some sushi or sashimi so you actually could see and taste the fish.  Sorry, but much better alternatives."}
{"text":"I really do like the food here....but the take out service is really really poor. Usually takes an hour to get them to pick up the phone. Call goes straight to voice mail. So unfort. I take business elsewhere...which is too bad cause I love their salmon!
Maybe they are so popular or something!? But they need a better take out system. It used to be great!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Shichimi for years now, over 5 for sure. I have always ordered a dynamite roll and the Tokyo combination. Take out is the primary source of business here I believe but they had a renovation within the past few years, the inside is also quite nice. The sushi is fresh, perfect temperature, and fast. When visiting most recently, we ordered from the all you can eat dinner menu, which was fairly priced at around 23 bucks.

Great spot will be back again!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend for the first time for dinner on a Friday night and it was surprisingly not busy. When we were seated, we got our menus and I ordered the Dinner Special(chicken teriyaki on rice, vegetable and shrimp tempura, california roll,  and 1 ebi sushi.) for 10.99. Our soup and salad came fast and they were bigger portions than most places i've been to. The teriyaki sauce is really good. and there was a good amount of chicken on the rice. The only thing I did not like was the california roll. they were really small and cut too thin. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"I would say this place is \"ok\".  We always get take-out instead of eating in, as the atmosphere is not great - sort of like cafeteria tables.   I find the pricing actually to be very reasonable in terms of sushi places....one of hte reasons we eat there.  There is a massive selection of rolls - my absolute favourite is the Shichimi roll - which is tear-dropped shape, filled with spicy tuna and tempura, and is soooo good.  Their sushi pizza is a little on the greasy side.

Basically, I continually go back there so it's obviously not bad.  It's not the best sushi in the city, by far, but it's good value for money.  Not where I'd go for a special date, or when I'm dying for awesome sushi, but it does the trick when we're hungry and in the mood for take-out sushi."}
{"text":"This is our neighbourhood sushi place. The sit down area in rarely packed. I used to worry about this until I realized that they do a boooming take out business."}
{"text":"Great sushi.
So fresh and tasty.
Lunch special is awesome I like the hot special"}
{"text":"I do takeout lunch here once a week. I get the same special every time, the hot special lunch (6 spicy salmon maki, 8 kamikaze maki, salad, and miso soup). SO GOOD! 

The woman running front counter is super sweet.

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"AYCE lunch sushi at Yonge and Lawrence? grand opening or just opened recently? sure why not. it's good value for my lunch dollar!

listen lots of reviews giving the place 3 stars or 2 stars, I don't agree. I thought sushi was fresh and cut cleanly. the rolls didnt overflow with rise, and all of the fried stuff wasn't over done or greasy.

It's on the upper level if you're walking up off Yonge st. decent sized dining room and lots of things to try and choose from as it's a big menu especially for lunch.

my advice? skip the salads and go right for the house special rolls and sushi pieces all tasted great and I was happy with the price of the whole thing. I like supporting joints like this even if they're just the typical AYCE place. service was fast and everything was as it should be.

You won't feel too too bad eating here save for that bloated feeling"}
{"text":"This is my first time going this Shichimi Sushi I order an chicken bento box. They don't put enough rice just small amount.  I just paid 8.99 for all that.  I didn't get enough food I was not too happy about it.   I don't think I would ever go back again."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant has seen a format change to an all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi place after its renovations. I hadn't tried it before the renovation, but it looks significantly more upscale after the renovation based on the old pictures still on Yelp. There's even a bar. Unfortunately, the table for our booth was wobbly.

The service wasn't great as is usual for Chinese-run restaurants. It was hard to flag down a waiter, but there was otherwise no problems. For each dish brought our table, the waiter told us what each roll was called. 

Soft drinks are included in the all-you-can-eat price, including C+, Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite and 7-UP. $12.99 weekday lunch or $24.99 for weekday dinner less the 10% post-renovation discount with drinks included is good value for the meal.

The spicy salmon sushi was not spicy at all, but the spicy mayo and salmon on top of the sushi tasted very good. The sushi were all well made and were not the rushed sushi you'd normally find at AYCE. In terms of fish to rice ratio, I'd say Shichimi currently leans toward more toward rice, and about average compared to other AYCE places. The rolls come in sizes of 8 pieces, but they are small. The Shichimi roll was good, as was the philadelphia and salmon & avocado roll (the salmon & avocado in particular had a good amount of salmon). The pork cultet was very thin and was made up fo mostly batter. The ice cream was served too cold and hard.  The crab meat handroll had a very disappointingly small amount of (imitation) crab meat compared to the rice and size of the handroll.

The lunch menu included all the usual sushi, including also octopus sushi. I didn't see anything else that was particularly interesting.

There is plenty of residential side-street parking nearby. They take credit card."}
