{"text":"Very avg. Like maybe below avg. And this rating is for the food.  The service was amazing. Very helpful. Just the food is not.."}
{"text":"Overall the service was timely, the atmosphere a bit loud, and the food decent. They do a nice birthday celebration for anyone with a birthday coming up!"}
{"text":"Seriously?

Cheap 'Vietnamese' food with a Plateau price tag. My friend ordered the Pad Thai, and then remembered she needed to ask about any nuts in the sauce due to an allergy and they just brought us out the jar of sauce, complete with price tag of $2.99.  Maybe lots of places do this, but it's pretty disappointing.  I had the lemongrass chicken, and it tasted just like any other miscellaneous asian stir fry with the same mix of peppers and carrots in a fairly good portion size.  

I haven't had their soups, so maybe they are amazing, and the spring roll was ok, but everything else on their menu is basically veg mix + meat + (jar?) sauce. $15.95+tax gets you curry, rice or noodles and spring roll or soup.  This is definitely not Schezuan.

Also, strangely enough: we had a reservation on a Saturday and were seated right away but the same 3 groups of people were waiting to be seated from the time we arrived and throughout our entire meal even though we were sitting there facing three empty tables? So, make a reservation, I suppose."}
{"text":"Wow! I went with my husband, we both are unfortunately allergic to onions. They not only gave us food with onions after we explicitly told them no onion or green onions on anything, they also got hostile with us saying we must pay for the dish we barely touched. Never going back and will let anyone know its terrible service and attitude there. Oh!!! Forgot to mention they threatened to call the cops on us, so we called for them because they were obviously bluffing and we knew we were in the right. Thanks for trying to make us pay for trying to hospitalizing us."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant with some nice Vietnamese soups and spring rolls. We often buy extra spring rolls to take home from here. The service on a Friday night was a bit spotty, being difficult to get the attention of wait person. The seats at the front have an advantage/disadvantage. People who are in a group who smoke will often go out and hang around the window while smoking. If you are smoker or a group that smokes, then it lets you continue to hang out while smoking when the window is open. But if you aren't a smoker, you do get wafts of smoke through the window from those who do this.

Fair warning about the desserts, the carrot cake was stale and they drizzled chocolate over it to hide it. (They would do better to just not carry it, if it is going stale.)"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken curry with vegetables and the chicken pad Thai (both with imperial roles). We were able to split a single dish as a full meal between me and my girlfriend. 

Both meals and the rolls were excellent. I fully recommend it. I ordered for pickup and it was ready in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Delicious food, so-so service. 

We went to Tay-Do for a big group dinner. Bonus points that they could accommodate a 20+ group, but they didn't do the best job. We were squished into the solarium area, in very tight quarters.  Perhaps we were a few more people than originally planned, but it still felt like they expected us to sit on top of one another.  The service, although brusque, was quick and efficient, and they manage to serve us in waves, so it was never a question of half the table getting their food and everyone else staring, but instead they would work their way through the group bringing plates, so people could progressively start eating as those around them received their plates.  I also got jostled on more than one occasion by a waiter running by when I was hanging up my coat on the coat rack.  I know that space is at a premium, but would you mind not plowing down the pregnant lady while she hangs up her coat?

The food is delicious!  I have a soft spot for big bowls of vermicelli topped with grilled meats, salad and spring rolls, and this stuff was great!

I will definitely be back, but much earlier in the evening, before the giant groups of partiers come to get their multiple bottles of wine on, and without a huge group."}
{"text":"Really a treat for the savy eater!  

From the outside, it looks like a corner dive with a nice sign.  But when  you walk in, it's actually quite large and quite crowded.

Unfortunately the staff doesn't communicate too well in English, but I was with french speaking Quebecois and they translated. So make sure you have your french speaker!

I'll start with the soup Tonkinoise.  AMAZING.  It's like a little bowl of rare flank PHO. A thin broth packed with flavors.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and it just complimented the meats and chives.  Definitely a must try.

I also had the egg roll...  releau?  something like that...   it was whatevers.  wasn't too crazy about it.

The General Tao is one of their specialties, and I can tell you why...  It's a lightly battered chicken morsel fried and covered in a red tomato sauce. The sauce is sweet, but definitely tomatoe based. Like a sweet ketchup.  It's freakin amazing.  Coupled with rice: it's definitely worth the trip.

I also had the pad thai: I was craving thai which is how we ended up here.  I however, did not get my thai fix.  The overall color of the pad thai was pinkish.  And it lacked that nutty cashew flavor found in more authentic thai versions.  But, this is a Vietnamese spot. So whatever.  The over all taste was pleasant, the noodle was nice and gummy with a sweet after taste.

I tried their shrimp on a skewer.  Sweet.  a little stiff, lack the pop fresh grilled shrimp has. but it had extraordinary flavor.

This is definitely a place I recommend to any foodie looking to eat something different in Montreal.  They have plenty of dishes to taste, and  you can bring your own bottle of wine!!

There's a wine shop around the corner, with an extensive collection.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Having read some of the other reviews, I think your experience will vary depending on what you order. I've been to Tay Do many times over the years and have always ordered a combo meal of grilled meats, which comes with a small house soup as a starter. I can definitely recommend this meal option as it is very tasty and almost as good as some of the other \"more authentic\" Vietnamese restaurants in Montreal. Bonus points: this restaurant is BOYB.

{"text":"Nice neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant on Duluth. They have a terrace for the warmer weather. The food is your pretty standard Vietnamese grill fare. The specialty is definitely the grilled meats, but the pho is actually a better bargain. Moderately priced and definitely makes for a good night out."}
{"text":"Went there with friends and was thoroughly impressed by the wait staff, menu & pricing. We were eleven and got served in a timely manner. the food was fresh, well prepared and delicious."}
{"text":"Nous avons pris:  
Entrées
- Soupe tonkinoise: 1/5. Avez-vous déjà goûter à une soupe tonkinoise instant....il s'en vend dans les épiceries asiatiques. C'est pareil....
- Rouleaux impériaux: 1/5. En réalité, ce sont des rouleaux de printemps frits sans viandes avec beaucoup de choux et trop de gras. 
Plats principaux:
- Sauté de fruits de mer avec riz avec sauce satay: 1/5. Sauce soya épaissi. Riz trop cuits. Bonne portion. Fruits de mer restreints
- Pad thai au poulet: 1/5. Fade. Petit morceaux de poulet secs. Sauce plate. Je vous suggère thai express! 

Je donne une étoile parce que je n'ai pas retourné mes plats. Et même si je m'attendais à du \"white viet\"...c'est très loin d'être bon. C'est du fast food asiatique très mal exécuté."}
{"text":"Tay Do is one of my favorite inexpensive bring your own wine restaurants in the Plateau. I've been going here for years. I'm giving it a ranking of 4 stars simply because it's inexpensive. It's perfect for those Tuesday nights when you just want to get out of the house and have a quick bite and a glass of wine, without breaking your weekend restaurant budget. I've given it a 4 star ranking, but please keep in mind that I'm comparing it to other restaurants in the same price range.

They will also accommodate large groups. It can get a little loud in there at times. But all and all it's a safe bet for around $20."}
{"text":"Food is average, as well as the place. Service was too slow. I was invited there, however I would not recommend it. The only positive thing is that you can bring your own wine, and in case you forgot to get it, you can buy it from a store next to the place."}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing had to say about this place. A cheap, bring your own wine schezuan place where the food is TO DIE FOR! I love it!!! The portions are big and soooooo tasty!! I usually get the \"combo A\" which comes with a soup and chicken with vegetables on a bed of noodles and it costs about $15. Totally worth it!! Why even consider going anywhere else for schezuan??"}
{"text":"Petit restaurant asiatique sur le plateau, proche du métro mont-royal. 

Nous avons été un samedi soir. Le resto était presque plein. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi il a juste 3/5 sur yelp, je trouve que la bouffe était quand même bonne (en plus d'être un resto BYOB!).les desserts sont super cute avec les petits parapluies en top :)

Cependant la serveuse ne semble pas parler anglais... ça va être un peu compliqué pour ceux qui ne parlent pas français."}
{"text":"The place is a Fresh airy place near Duluth. I liked the ambience. However, the food was not up to the expectations.  And the service was so so.  I ordered the ginger chicken combo. It was sweet. I usually do not like sweet food. I asked for spicy recommendations, but the waiter said there were none!! A Thai place without spicy food... it was quite a shock. Also, the waiter was very rude. He had no interest in our likings. I paid 20 bucks for an average meal. 
It is a bring your own wine... which helps."}
{"text":"The soups are excellent and the vegetables are fresh and delicious.  Actually the soups are better than excellent, you'll slurp too much of them.  Soupe Citronelle!  The only real knock is that it can get really loud in there on a busy night"}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is probably the best thing about this place, it looks like a nice place to go on a date or meet up with friends.The service is okay, nothing less and nothing more. The food however is not so great. 

We've ordered fried scallops for appetizers and unfortunately it looked and tasted less than average.  In fact, it was the first time I've seen ruined scallops being served. Basically, the chief smashed a perfectly good scallop and then fried it in breadcrumbs and served it with ketchup. It looked less than appetizing and tasted pretty much like fried breadcrumbs.

The main course was much better, however, it lacked a bit of presentation. The sauce was splattered all over the plate (I took a photo) and that's how it was served to me. 

Overall review? As much as I love Vietnamese food I'd go and explore other places as  Tay Do did not impress me at all."}
{"text":"Pas sérieux. Service bête, comme si on li avait quelque chose, à la limite du méchant. 
Bouffe correcte mais l'interaction avec le serveur donne le goût de sacrer son camp de là....."}
