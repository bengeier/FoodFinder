{"text":"It's a private party place. I was here for a wedding reception. I had mushroon ravioli, pretty good (3.5 out of 5) and pan seared filet mignon (really good 4.5 out of 5.) I don't know if I would recommend it as a lunch place, but as a private party venue, most definitely! Great food, great fun!"}
{"text":"Culinaria is one of those treasures that you stumble upon and want to share with everyone, so here I am! From the charm of its farm house heritage to the modern interior and cuisine, I can't get enough.  When I became a vegan a few months ago for health reasons, I knew I would miss Culinaria's Lamb Chops, Chicken Supreme and other amazing dishes, but was surprised by their extensive vegan menu. My favourite is their cauliflower \"steak\" with red quinoa pilaf.  They also have some amazing fish dishes for those who enjoy their seafood and fresh fish."}
{"text":"I attended a private party at the Elliot house, and I was really happy with the entire evening.   The setting is a colonial stone farmhouse, built sometime between 1836 and 1850. Although clearly renovated, it has retained all of the colonial style charms.   We had a set menu, of course, as it was an event and there were about 30 in our party. We were given a private room just off of the main lobby and it was beautifully decorated with a fireplace and all.    The service was great, very attentive and the food was good as well. I wouldn't go as far to say that my dinner was spectacular but I was impressed that we were all served at once, no one sent anything back and it was all cooked well and good quality.  Catering to such a wide variety of tastes is difficult at the best of times, and I feel that they made a clear effort.  The set menu gave a beef, fish and vegetarian choice along with salads and desserts. The Crème brûlée was definitely the highlight of the meal.  Overall the location is really special. Super unique. Very pretty and cozy. Another party was enjoying cocktails in the main room as we arrived, this would be a fantastic spot for a private cocktail party as well.   Lots of parking and several options for private rooms to suit parties of various sizes."}
{"text":"We had our office Christmas party here. It was great. The staff are true professionals and they are so warm, friendly, and put up with all of our rowdy shenanigans. The decor was lovely and festive.   The food was amazing. I don't think I've had a better steak than the one I had here in a long time. The meat was clearly of a very high quality. It was well-seasoned and evenly cooked to my requested medium rare. The baguettes they had to start the meal were probably some of the best baguettes I've ever had. Ever. I filled up on that bread and I usually avoid the bread basket. It was just too good to resist.   Great experience. I would definitely come back here personally for a special dinner."}
{"text":"Culinaria is a higher end local restaurant.  I was visiting from the States on business and my business partner selected this place.  I thought it was a more a 3 and 1/2 star location.  The ratings seem high though on Yelp (4 and 1/2 as I write), so maybe there is more to Culinaria than I saw or tasted.  I had the steak and it was average.  The wine list was very good though, and we had a couple of good bottles.  The service was top notch, so hats off here.  The atmosphere was classy.  The restaurant is located in an old farm house and there is some history to that.  I probably would not go back, but my meal was decent and a good time was had by all."}
{"text":"While this was a very comfortable and home-like fine dining restaurant with exceptional service, I must say I wasn't too impressed by the food. There was nothing wrong, but I just wasn't awed by anything, which I felt I should have been for its price point.   From the bread starter, which I thought was a little stale, to the calamari appetizer, which was a bit tough to chew, to my pan seared jumbo sea scallops entree, which was paired with an unsettling sour glaze, to the chocolate truffle cake, which closely resembled a Metro cake I bought a few days prior... the food was overall underwhelming and mediocre.  My boyfriend ordered the lamb lollipops appetizer and absolutely loved it, but I just thought it was okay. It had a slight burnt taste to it, but not enough seasoning in my opinion. He also ordered the 10 oz grilled angus NY steak, which came with asparagus and mashed potatoes, all of which was standard-tasting.   Honestly, nothing \"wow-ed\" me. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This fine dining establishment in the old Elliott House is a real culinary experience. Not only do they conduct culinary classes, they have an amazing set up with small intimate rooms that are old school chic.   I recently hosted a small family gathering there and our experience was wonderful.   The service was top notch, the food excellent and the ambience just right.   From steak to seafood to pasta, a solid menu with no weak performers."}
{"text":"I came here recently for a full day work event.  It was my first time here so I didn't know what to expect.    The place was in a building that looked like a small house.  When I went inside it was really beautifully decorated and we had an area sectioned off to ourselves by these big wooden walls that slid back and forth.    As part of our event we got to prep and cook our own meals as a team building exercise.  We had a caprese salad, chicken parmesan with fettuccine alfredo, and tiramisu for dessert.  We were a bit nervous based on our teams cooking skills, but the chef and helpers were extremely friendly and helpful.  The meal turned out amazing and was so delicious!  The chicken parmesan had a bit of a kick to it, which went really great with the Alfredo sauce on the pasta.  The tiramisu had a splash of Marsala wine which made it a bit different than your typical.  Amazing!  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch a few times and the food is consistently amazing.  The escargot is incredible, I highly recommend it.  The service is a bit off (the waiter typically spills water when serving and forgets some details) but it can be overlooked given the quality of the food.   Great place for lunch meetings too."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner, and the whole experience felt very classy. The food was very well prepared and tasty. The workers are very professional and polite, and the dessert was so delicious.  Try the Bailey's creme brûlée!!"}
{"text":"The food was incredibly salty and it was very over priced.  I took my team there for lunch...which was a bad idea as it took far too long for the meal.  I would not recommend this restaurant as a lunch spot."}
{"text":"I was invited to speak for a breakfast meeting at this restaurant. When we first pull in, I was kind of skeptical but the minute I set foot in the restaurant, everything changed.  The coat check is right in the entrance when you come in on your right. On your left there is a nice and very warm 2 side fire place. You get a very nice ambiance right from the start. We were welcomed by 2 gentlemen with super thick accents :) that very nice and helpful. They had the room all set up for the presentation, perfect U shape so everyone can see and eat comfortably. The projector was there and ready to go, it took 2 minutes to set up, what a breeze! The breakfast was all ready as well, fruits, fresh pasties, they make everything fresh everyday from their own kitchen, it was so tasty!! Then besides all these lovely breakfast sides such as yogurt, granolas, juice, etc was the nice egg benedict with ham and bacon. May I state that the bacon was cooked to perfection, crisp and the egg as well. I was very pleased by the choice of the committee to have our presentation there.  I would love to go back and enjoy a sit down breakfast instead of speaking :)"}
{"text":"We came here for an impromptu date night. The food was good and of the caliber I would expect for a place like this, but the service was really off. Not organized, there were two wait staff, neither of whom seemed to know what the other was doing. Even the table setting was not complete when we sat down and my husband's menu had a stain.   They may be having an off-night service-wise, but for the price and to match the food quality, they will need to do better."}
{"text":"Always delicious, and great service. I come here every couple months, and am always impressed with my order. I would point out however, that this is not a steakhouse, and so the steak was alright, but not great. Everything else has been fantastic."}
{"text":"This particular restaurant should be a 4 star place but the lunch service was surprisingly poor and it's being demoted to a 3 star.  This restaurant appears to aim at a classy and upscale service but it falls flat as you hear the yelling between servers in the lobby on where to find particular dining items, the horrible pacing, and a particular server's nonchalent impression of a mobster boss.  The food was actually quite well done.  The atmosphere was warm and very nicely and tastefully decorated for the festive season.  It's just too bad about the service.  I took my boss here for a business lunch and we arrived after 12 pm and we didn't leave till after 2 pm.  We wanted to have dessert but because it took way too long, we didn't have the time.  We ordered their feature salad (baby spinach salad with roasted walnuts, goat cheese, and blueberries in a balsamic vinegar dressing) and featured main (pan seared scallops with a mango black bean salsa).  I'm not exaggerating when I say the salad took 30 minutes to arrive at the table.  Though the main server was polite enough, he took way too long doing everything.  When we were seated, we didn't have menus to peruse until 10 minutes later and only after we asked.  There was another 40 minute gap between our salad and mains.  I'm not sure who is doing the pacing but it was horrible. They really need to rethink their service if they want to appeal to the business lunch crowd.  No one can afford 2 hours for lunch during the business time.  Even if you're trying to win a client, service should be efficient.. not slow!  As for the mobster boss wannabe, he didn't do anything outrageously wrong but he had this constant scowl and appearance that is more attuned to Sopranos.  He also yelled in the foyer about \"Hey Carlos... where did ya put tha sugah and sweetener... I can't find it.\" or \"Ya, do that... the timing should be fine when their done their appetizer.\".  For a 'fine dining' experience, I don't think yelling by the staff to organize themselves should be done.  As for the food itself, it started out a bit weak with the salad.  The salad was not overly impressive but all items on the plate was fresh.  It was just boring and expensive.  It was small for the price point of $9.  The main entree was well executed. Three fat pieces of perfectly seared scallops sat on finely julienned carrots and a mango black bean salsa.  The scallops had a perfect crispy crust and was cooked gently so it wasn't tough or overdone.  The carrots were sauteed in light coating of butter and the mango salsa was a bright flavourful punch.  The only rant I have for this was the portion. Though the scallops were large, you only got 3 pieces.  For nearly $30, that's quite pricey.  Also, the carrot and salsa was barely 1/4 cup of each so it's overall a small entree.  If the service was better, I'd feel better paying the prices but I feel it should be knocked down in price for the experience.     As for the atmosphere, it's a very intimate environment where private dining rooms are off the lobby and they're decorated in a tasteful and upscale manner.  It's just too bad the service really ruined the experience and makes you think it's an overpriced place."}
{"text":"Really great food and good service. Told the waitstaff we were in a bit of a rush and they were very prompt and accommodating. Caesar salad was top notch. Really tasty pastas too!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Canada.  We decided to try to eat at  some  local restaurants outside the hotel.  Due to our unfamiliarity with the area, we almost missed an excellent dinner as we braved Toronto rush hour traffic and missed our exit a few times.  When you drive up to the restaurant, it is easy to miss because it is next to a fairly imposing Buddhist temple and looks like a small house set back from the road.  Once inside however, the decor is warm, inviting and elegant.  This was a nice discovery after the lengthy travel time.  But, in the end...it was worth it.  Culinaria, which is also referred to as the Elliot house is an interesting business concept.  The restaurant is a training school for professional chefs, but also opens its doors to invite the community in for various culinary classes.  We were there on a week night and the restaurant which is located in an industrial district about 30 minutes outside of Toronto was not full.  This provided opportunity for some interesting dialog with our server.  The meal was excellent.  We had certainly worked up an appetite!  I had a fillet Mignon which had excellent flavor.  My husband also enjoyed his entree.  Preceding our entree we both order the Butternut Squash soup which also passed muster.  Finishing off our dinner, we tried their apple crepes.  They graciously split one for us in the kitchen and topped the crepe with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  According to our server, the menu changes frequently and there is an emphasis on local product when possible.  If you are in the Toronto area and would like to try something a little different, we would recommend you consider this restaurant off the beaten track."}
{"text":"I had private first communion function here for party of 30 today.  The venue was cozy, clean and beautiful ambient.  Food were great, rack of lamb was delicious! Staff were also nice and friendly.  I highly recommend this place for small functions.  Looking forward coming back for probably for a date night."}
{"text":"Fabulous menu, everything cooked and presented beautifully.  Service is also fabulous!  Great ambiance too...great place for a business lunch or even dinner, also very elegant for a nice date night."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to hold any event. I live in the U.S. but my friend was having her wedding in the area and we stumbled upon Culinaria Restaurant to use as our venue for a pre-wedding dinner. I had sent them an email about the event and they were very responsive and accommodating. We had set up everything for the pre-wedding dinner. I only had pictures to go off by the time of the event and never had an opportunity to see the venue. When I arrived an hour early to set up for the event, I was thoroughly surprised. The place was so beautiful and very professional. It far exceeded by expectations. We set up for the event and they were super helpful. Also the food was amazing. We had a preset that we designed before the event and it was very reasonable. I live in NYC and the food was better than some of the michelin restaurants I've been to and pricing is very reasonable. I highly recommend this place for any venues and parties."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem I must say. Not in a busy shopping complex. So easy to miss. Went there for lunch and loved the vibe Good warm bread, excellent salad dressing, great seafood bowl, and a good philly cheese steak. Good quality service. Great experience  Highly recommended"}
