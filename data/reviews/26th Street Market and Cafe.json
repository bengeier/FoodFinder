{"text":"Full disclosure, I come here a lot. Having said that, every single time I get take out I go back to work and exclaim \"this is the last time I'll ever eat there!\" Only to slink back the next time I forget to pack a lunch.   The inconsistency is borderline schizophrenic & that really bums me out, everyone who works here is incredibly nice & I like them all but, no one really knows how to cook here. I started ordering all my sandwiches cold because I couldn't bring myself to pick wilted lettuce and mealy tomato out of the sandwich after it was crushed in the panini press and somehow was still cold in the center. The menu and the prices seem to have stabilized but, for a while they both seemed to not only change daily but to change between orders.   Also, can we just call this place what it is? It's a place that wasn't selling enough wedding dresses so they started selling soup.  I don't want to end on that so I will say that the chicken & tuna salad are fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a quick coffee and sandwich. At least 3 different types of coffee everyday, fresh. The menu variety and quality paired with the prices is nearly unbeatable. Some of the nicest, most genuine restaurant staff I've ever met. Very well-kept and the layout is great: two huge garage door style walls that open in the spring/summer, stage for live music, private meeting room, and comfortable seating for dining. What else do you need?  Lunch gets packed, but it just shows how good it really is. I've only just recently started coming here for my morning coffee and I don't plan on going anywhere else for quite some time!"}
{"text":"This place has seem to hit its stride. Good food, quick service. Great place for lunch and coffee!"}
{"text":"Working at the far end of the Strip, I'm always on the lookout for something new.  Today I saw that the 26th Street Market and Cafe were officially open, so I popped in for lunch.    Everything is help yourself, with the exception of their sandwich board.  Essentially it's a one stop shop - get your cigarettes, sandwich, coffee, and candy bar all in one location.  Not a bad thing if you're short on time for a lunch hour.  If you're looking to dine in, they have a large room available to eat your goodies in a very home-like enviornment.  Sure it may have garage doors as windows, but sofas and wooden tables give it a warm feel.  This would be a great venue to have bands come play, too.  I ordered a turkey panini to go, grabbed a bag of chips, and a bottle of iced tea --- yup!  Under $10!  Gotta love it :)  I'll be coming back to try their flatbread pizza or meatball hoagie...  So far, so good from the 26th Street Market and Cafe"}
{"text":"Everything here is just kinda meh.. The food is ok, sometimes I worry how long things have sat because nobody is ever here.   It's nice and convenient if you just need a pop or chips. Other than that I probably won't be trying the food again.  Staff is all very nice though!"}
