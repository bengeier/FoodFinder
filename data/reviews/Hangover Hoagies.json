{"text":"Came here for a quick sandwich while in town for business. It looked modest from the outside and I was SHOCKED at how delicious the sandwiches were. The next day, I brought 2 coworkers with me and they felt the same. I had the \"scrumptious turkey\" 12\" hoagie....I'm from Philadelphia, so I know my hoagies....this place was delicious and I can't recommend it highly enough. Friendly staff, good food, good service - what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Thought I'd write a quick review since I don't see anything recent for this place...

Though this is a little hard to find, it's definitely worth looking for.  Hangover Hoagies is located inside the liquor store, just to the left as you walk in.

I rolled in a little before they opened up, but the sandwich artist behind the counter gave me a reassuring smile and promised to help me shortly.  Sure enough, it was only about 2 minutes (still before the official 'open' time) and she was already helping me decide on what i wanted.

When I saw the prices, i decided I'd go for a full sandwich.  I should have caught the little knowing smile she threw me as I confirmed I wanted a full sandwich and was planning on eating it there.

When she set the tray up, I humbly asked right then for a to-go container as I knew there was no way I was going to finish this monster.

Meats, toppings, veggies were all tasty, fresh and abundant and the bread was fantastic.  Crusty on the outside but light and delicious inside.

The seating is limited (biggest table may seat 3, if everyone is skinny) but if the weather is decent, you can sit on your tailgate/hatch and people watch (Yay for ASU in the spring/summer when it's just a little bit warm and the views are fantastic).

Definitely going to be a regular for me from now on.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Awesome people! It is inside a liquor store so not for kids but if you're on a beer run and need some nourishment I recommend the Boozy Sub! So yummy after drinking a couple beers. The owners are super nice and are always wanting to bring you back."}
{"text":"This place has the best sandwiches. The bread was really good, you can add all the veggies you want at no extra cost, and the portions are huge. Really great value. The staff is nice too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Having lived in New Jersey in the past, I've always been intrigued by the small \"Hoagies\" sign above the liquor store it is in. Finally, I remembered it when trying to figure out what to do for dinner and was not in the least disappointed.

I was pleasantly surprised walking in that they went through the trouble to put a half wall in between the liquor and the 2 tables with 4 seats in total next to the sandwich counter. Seriously though, the area was clean and frankly, this is exactly what I like to see in a sub shop, just don't plan on having a place to eat there.

They offer a good selection of classic hoagies with all the standard fillings. They also offer some nicer toppings such as fresh mozzarella and pesto which was nice to see. I ordered their Italian. It has capicola, ham, genoa salami, provolone, tomato, onions, mayo, and oil and vinegar. While not an east coast hoagie expert by an means, I've had enough to tell you that this is the real deal. The bread is that nice hearty bread with a substantial but still soft crust. The meats were quality and the mayo, oil, vinegar, and toppings blended to make that perfect classic hoagie taste.

To add to it, the footlong was as substantial as you would hope for it to be and the prices while not super cheap were definitely good for what you get. I have a feeling I will be craving this place again soon."}
{"text":"Had the Italian Hangover and it was amazing!!!
You would never expect it from a liquor store."}
{"text":"Sooooo definitely your late night spot.  Hoagies found in the liquor store...I love it.  Found this place via yelp reviews, got there and to be honest the area at night was a tad bit shady, but it was well lit...the guys are friendly and the Hoagies are pretty damn good and just what you need to complete the night.  Service is quick and they have just the right selection.  My favorite is that they have cheap soda in all flavors which makes the perfect combination...and if you so desire obviously the very well stocked liquor store is there for you to find the perfect night cap while you wait for you sammie to be made."}
{"text":"This place was the biggest surprise I have ever had for the good in matching ratings with the actual food. I have been looking for a sub place that combined great items with great bread. They have got to have the best breads, it is not an airy bread like most other places or dried sub breads. When toasted it has a great texture in that it is similar to a real bagel with crispy outside and chewy on the inside. 

The meats and subs ingredients are original and even though it is basic it is very well done. I have been here 3 times and has been so pleased with the 3 different subs I have had. The girl behind the counter is the only one I have ever seen there so maybe it is her that is the key to combining these ingredients to the subs. Either way, even though it is far from where I am, I will keep on going back for more. Only complaint is the place is a liquor store so it is not the best setting, heck there are only about 3 small table for two with no great view except maybe beer posters. I tried to take out, but the smell was so great, I stopped at a parking lot and ate right there."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall. Cheap, convenient, some of best guys in town. Best sub shop in Tempe, very under rated. Can't go wrong with the Impaired Chicken or Italian Hangover."}
{"text":"This spot is great!! Especially for the price point and quality. If your not too hungry get a six inch, if your hungry definitely get the 12. I walked in and was instantly greeted by Andy who was busy making a sandwich but still had the presence of mind to acknowledge me. He recommended an italian hangover and I added banana peppers and jalape√±o, delicious! Thank you Andy ! I will be back! Oh yeah and it's inside sun stop liquor so you can grab a sixer to go, now that's convenient!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time tonight. Best hoagie I've ever had!   Thank you for this yummy food and for sharing some awesome tea with me! I'll be back tomorrow! 
 
DELICIOUS DINNER!!!!!!!! And super friendly!"}
{"text":"Really awesome sandwiches. I have gone here a few times and I am finally getting a chance to leave a review. A friend introduced me and I will always go here over your standard chain sandwich shop. It's inside a liquor store, but that doesn't make it any less delicious. Quick service, and the bread is never old/soggy."}
{"text":"They're back!!!!  I am so happy that Hangover Hoagies has returned.  The service is, as always, very hospitable and friendly.  The food, as before, is amazing.  The best sandwich place in the valley. IMO."}
{"text":"Pricing shown in images here is old. Current pricing on the 12\" sandwich is on par with \"another sandwich shop's\" \"huge sandwich.\"

But the quality. Oh man, the quality. What a delicious sandwich this was. I am sad that I ate it only because that means it's gone. I am sad that I ate my second sandwich immediately after the first rather than saving it for later, because now it is gone. 

Go here. I had the Hungover Italian and the Effed-Up Reuben. Both were great!"}
{"text":"Fast & friendly service, not to mention excellent subs at a great value! You couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good sandwiches...way better than subway. $7.99 for 12\" sub. Happy hour mon-fri (3-6pm)gets you $2.00 off."}
{"text":"This place is so legit! A total hole in the wall in a corner of a liquor store. I've eaten here three times in the past week, no shame. Some (most) sub places have pretty gross veggies and extras for their subs, but they have super fresh ingredients. Also, their DD Veggie sub doesn't feel like just an afterthought for non-meat eaters. There's a good variety of veggies on it and they even put whole, super fresh basil leaves on it which is such a nice touch. The avocado they use is pretty perfect too, I haven't gotten any brown or overripe pieces on anything I've ordered. Subs are true to size and you get what you pay for in my opinion. This is definitely going to be a new favorite late night spot for me!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on business and was looking for food. I ordered through Grub Hub and I must say, the Hoagies were EXCELLENT.  I was tasty and very filling.  My order was right and it came om time.  Everything was fresh and just how I like my sandwiches.  I would surely recommend this place.  Too bad you don't have locations in California."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here to grab sandwiches to bring with us to the airport! After they got a pat down they sure were delicious! The gentleman serving us was very nice and knowledgeable and the price was 12 dollars about for two sandwiches chips and two sodas! Go to this little gem tucked inside of a liquor shop!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, cannot get any better! The music here is also great, nice popular music vibes, did you are a college student, this is a must go!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was so perfect.  I ordered a tuna cold sandwich and a meat sandwich. Both were perfect in every way. They weren't too saucy nor too dry. The potato salad as an extra was real treat! Avoid subway and go here if it's nearby."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop with creative and delicious subs and nice staff. We picked 4 different hot subs and everyone raved. We'll make this our campus sandwich from here on out."}
{"text":"Excellent service best subs I've ever had. Recommend the \"effed up\"Reuben. Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Sober Club was amazing. The bread was incredible & you could tell the gent making our food was not just good at what he was doing, he enjoyed it!

Inside a liquor store and not a lot of seating, but with Sandwiches this good, who cares..?

This place may rival my beloved Cheba Hut. Yeah, that good.."}
{"text":"Delicious bread and mayonnaise spread. I get the Faded Turkey sandwich almost every time! I've also experience really good service there. Really hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Seriously found this place on yelp and trusted the reviews. Totally worth it! I was a bit worried it being located in a liquor store but boy I'm glad I got past that. These sandwiches were at best and the bread was so amazingly soft. YUM! The guys took their time to take care of me and my sandwich. Prices were unbelievable for how amazing these hoagies were. 10/10 would absolutely recommend!"}
{"text":"Apparently they closed for a few years and have just opened up again recently. I had a great first impression as the sandwiches here are actually quite good and they are open until early in the morning. Due to these reasons I plan on making Hangover Hoagies an option for late night food. The people running the sandwich part of the liquor store are extremely friendly and want to make sure that you wanted every possible ingredient on the sandwich. I do have to say that the location is a bit tricky as it's located inside the liquor store on the left side. There are also only a few small tables so I would highly recommend getting take-out for the food.

Honestly I'm surprised that this place is not more popular than it is, as long as you can find it of course."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is great!  Love the Effed Up Ruben, Hammered Pastrami, and Cheese Steak the most.  Fresh bread, tasty meat and lots of sauce.  Best in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Exceptional value, great ingredients, and insanely fast service for what is basically a sandwich counter.  By luck I found them due to using Uber eats, and I can say it is a hidden gem. I've had a few of the sandwiches, and have had the Italian multiple times (just this week) again, thanks Uber eats. That said, if you want an honest hoagie at an unbeatable price, then this is your spot."}
{"text":"By far the best sandwiches I've ever had outside of the East Coast. They use high quality bread and the meats and veggies are of equal quality. The proportions of the sandwiches are as close to perfect as you could ask for; not too much bread, not too many sauces. Just right. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is very nice. Even if you are an East Coast sandwich snob, having grown up on sandwiches from Jewish and Italian delis (like me) I can not recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! It's never too busy, I've never had to wait in line. There's always the same 2 dudes working and they're real friendly. They've never messed up my order. The sandwhiches are always loaded and fresh, and they have pretty great prices. I live right down the street which may explain why I go so much, but even after I move, Hangover Hoagies will still be my go-to sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"This is the most unsuspecting sandwich joint I've ever been to!  It's literally as close to a hole in the wall as you can get - it's a sandwich shop inside of a strip mall liquor store!

The sandwich I had was fresh with great fillings, and the portion size was ample, especially for the price.  The bread was great and hearty and held up well to the health bit of filling.  This beats the hell out of Subway (and most other sandwich shops for that matter)."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! I've gone here 10+ times and never once had a bad experience! They are extremely hard workers also!"}
{"text":"Listen too me I swear too god in Jesus name some of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life"}
{"text":"This spot just opened up about a week ago. They're bread is off the hook, and the meat and cheese selection is above adequate. Build your own, or choose one of the hangover themed delicacies. Either way, you are in for a treat. They are still putting in tables, so I suggest taking them to go, for now..when this place gets up and going completely...it will be the monster of university area delis."}
{"text":"I came in here due to the coupons in the student coupon books. I wasn't expecting much from a sandwich shop in a liquor store but was pleasantly surprised. The meat was good and the veggies were pretty fresh. The only knock i would have is that it the girl, who was really friendly and got all toppings just right, making it takes awhile to get through it and I was the only one there. I am sure I will be back as I think it was better than going to subway or port-o-subs close to campus."}
{"text":"When we first showed up it looked weird. It just looked like a regular liquor store, but once you walk inside there's a little sandwich shop. BEST SANDWICHES EVER. I got the \"Italian hangover\" with my dad and my mom got the \"faded tuna\". So yummy for both. Not to mention the owner/manager (or so we think) was so welcoming and attentive. Even the woman who made our sandwich asked how everything was going and if we needed anything. This place was also very clean. Let's all support our local businesses and chose this place. It's great."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp as I was looking for someleave me to try. I was a little hesitant given its location inside the liquor store, but WOW!  The sandwich was about fantastic. All of the ingredients were extremely fresh, and the staff was amazing. I will definitely be going back to try their many different sandwiches."}
{"text":"What crap! Not open on sundays? How can you call yourself \"hangover\" anything and be closed on a Sunday!
Other than that nonsence... this place is soo good. The pesto bomb sandwich is so delish! They are huge sandwiches and not expensive at all. I pick up food from here atleast once a week for everyone at work."}
{"text":"Place looks like a hole in the wall but it actually sells some of the best subs. This and Cheba Hut are my favorite sub shops in Tempe"}
{"text":"If you took any of this at face value, you would probably miss out on one of the most fundamentally right sandwiches in Tempe.

Don't be fooled by the liquor store venue. Don't be distracted by it being 3 feet from a college campus where bad decisions are stock and trade.

These guys are slinging top notch ingredients in creative combinations, and wrapping it all in the most deceptively simple rolls. The product is a memorable meal with cool people. Kinda regretting waiting so long to stop here."}
{"text":"My first time here. Great customer service. The men were polite and friendly. They made great suggestions on customer favorites to theirs.. 

I ordered the hangover hoagie and holy wow. It's amazing. The bread wasn't too hard but just freshly perfect. The ingredients weren't overwhelming and all complimented each other. I would highly recommend this place for delivery or take out. 

Take out was quick as well. I was in and out in no time."}
{"text":"fantastic sandwiches.  I mean really great.  You have to check them out.  Super friendly staff too.  Plus you can stock up on beer while you wait."}
{"text":"This place has best sandwiches in Tempe hands down.  Don't get scared away, because of the fact that its inside the SunStop liquor store.  Everyone is super nice and friendly! The owner's name is Mike and he's one of the nicest guys.  Try my favorite the Italian!!!"}
{"text":"Never been into Hangover Hoagies but luckily, we have PostMates/UberEATS to take care of that.
I can't make judgment on anything other than their Italian sandwich. It's delicious, inexpensive, and full of flavor. Just enough sauce and spice for an Italian and the bread is always fresh. I would recommend if you want a cheap and tasty sub, Hangover Hoagies is the place to go. Had their cookies too and once they were hard as heck but every other time, they were perfect."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Can't even do the other sandwich shops anymore. Craving a sub this is the only place I go!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, great sandwich, great value. Drove by this place a millions times. I finally stopped, I'm glad I did. I got the Rueben, then I patted myself on the back. This was a win!!"}
{"text":"Don't ever go to Subway if your In this area.  I got a 6\" Italian hangover which I might add was the best sub I ever had and I also got the F up Ruben which was very special in my heart and in my stomach."}
{"text":"I got the Italian hangover and it was delicious! The bread was soft and the portion was very generous. The staff is always friendly there! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friend loved the cheese-steak sandwich and I very much liked my tuna.  I only took a star because I asked for double meat and the tuna seemed a bit sparse.  Maybe there should be a triple meat option.  Anyway, very tasty and I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Super yummy I am a sandwich person so I am a great judge !! I've had sandwiches in many cities in the us ! I love a family owned sandwich place ! Great quality !"}
{"text":"great subs! great service! perfect midnight food run, will be visiting a lot more. i would recommend to everyone who isn't socialist and against good times."}
{"text":"Just ordered on GrubHub, holy cow they are so delish! Can't wait to try something else next time. Huge hoagie for $8"}
{"text":"Have been ordering a lot through Postmates and so much of the food has been disappointing. Ordered from one of the famous sub shops the other day and it was so bad I picked off the turkey and threw the rest away. So still having a sub craving, gave in and ordered from Hangover. So far I've only tried the faded tuna and the Italian, but Hangover will now be my \"go to\" sandwich. Good bread, good meats and just well made."}
{"text":"Arguably the best subs in Tempe! For a really good price too. You can get a whole 12 inch for 7.99 dollars -amazing. The bread is so good and the subs taste so fresh! The owners and staff were so awesome. They gave us two free cookies while we were there too  over all great place!! Thanks hangover hoagies we'll be back"}
{"text":"I grew up loving sub sandwiches / hoagies. There were lots of little independent sandwich shops, all with their own specialties and flavors. The success of Subway and all of their clones has resulted in a world of bland, flavorless food units. 

Hangover Hoagies reminds me of the old days (in fact some of my favorite sandwich shops were inside of liquor stores back in the day, too.) Really nice bread, not stingy with the meat and cheese, fresh toppings, etc. 

The only reason I held back a star was the side items. Both the potato and macaroni salads could best be described as \"unfortunate\". They are the standard \"salad-from-a-tub\" affairs, but they are a disappointment when paired with a really good sandwich. I'll stick with chips in the future."}
{"text":"Just a little sandwich shop in a liquor store but some of the best sandwiches around. Everything is super fresh and the people that work there are really friendly. I'm giving them five stars for what it is vs what you would expect. Absolutely delicious hoagies, far superior to what any of the chain sub shops have to offer."}
{"text":"So I'm not from here but I was looking for a good spot for a sandwitch and I have to say this place is as good as it gets ! Deffinetley going again b4 I head back out of town!"}
{"text":"this place is ******* sexy, literally best sandwiches in the world, im in actual heaven if it does so exist"}
{"text":"OMG... Love the sandwiches here the veggie is absolutely awesome, as well as the meatball. Have tried them all. always fresh great flavor my kids love this place... Totally recommended"}
{"text":"We ordered from here a few weeks ago. Subs were great!"}
{"text":"I was a little worried about eating from a sandwich shop in a liquor store but after reading the reviews I had to try it and I was in the area yesterday.  I'm so happy I did - this place was really freaking good!  They have your basic sandwiches so don't come in here looking for anything fancy, come in here looking for a good traditional sandwich.  What stands out the most is that the bread is really f***ing good!  It's almost like a pretzel bread texture but it doesn't taste like pretzel bread.  It's thick and hearty and a 6\" sub filled me up.  I really need to find out where they get their bread from, it's that good!

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the girl working there.  She was honestly quite unpleasant and seemed very annoyed I was taking her away from her phone.  When she handed me my sandwich I caught her looking at her tip cup and rolled her eyes, assumingly because I didn't tip her.  Since she wasn't very pleasant I had no intention of tipping her.  I don't expect top notch customer service from a sandwich shop but a simple greeting and basic manners would have been nice and it would have earned her a tip.  

Overall, I won't let the poor customer service prevent me from going back.  Maybe she was having a bad day, who knows."}
{"text":"Beat sandwiches in all of Arizona. The Italian hangover on wheat is my go to sandwich and it's always amazing. The staff is all super friendly and it's always a great experience going. Check this place out, I guarantee you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! omg so delicious! you can't express how amazing this place is with words. you just have to try it. it's sooooooooooooooooooo delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a total hole-in-the-wall place. I was down in Tempe for the first Tempe visiting a friend. It was a quick and easy walk about a mile outside of campus. The sandwiches were great, and made them anyway you liked (even the weird request I have, like hallowing out the bun)! The price was unbeatable and such an easy grab before we headed to go out for the night."}
{"text":"So unique and delicious. Great value too. Try the white bread for a change. It's crispy! Cherry peppers are a must on all subs. Intoxicated Turkey is my go to. Such friendly staff too. And i love how i can grab a pack of beers too."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwidch shop in Az. Everything is good depending on what you are in the mood for. They have some Excellent Italian Grinders, and the Savory Turkey will change the way you look at eating healthy!
Delicious and good for you! Its family owned and operated so why not stop by today and support something worthwhile as compared to all those corporate slave run places like subway or silvermine!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at this place. Love it. It's on my list of places that I go to to try every item on the menu. Great guys working there too. And it's located inside a liquor store. Try to find a better location. Also, open til 2 am. Great for my nights driving around town."}
{"text":"Sandwich stop in a liquor store? Yes you must do it! This is hands down my favorite sandwich spot, I come here on a weekly basis. The amount of food you get for the price is unbeatable. The Italian hangover and sober club are my favs. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh God...


Just had the Effed Up Reuben...


And it effed my stomach up...


And I'm about to throw up...


Still 2 stars because it tasted good but... oh God... bleurp... bagargpahjh....."}
{"text":"I ordered the impaired chicken with no cheese and added jalape√±o, excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"The food world is so, so, so not fair. You've got all these mediocre chains occupying huge spaces on every corner. But the good stuff is tucked away into a narrow hallway of a liquor store. The tables are tiny. Boxes of cheap vodka are stacked around you. This might not appear to be the most inviting place. But it's 100% legit. 

I ordered the \"Effed up Ruben\" with corned beef, thousand island, bacon, tomatoes, and lettuce. It was better than it looked--and it looked great. At $7.99 for a 12\" it felt like a steal, and I had some leftover. 36 hours and a zap in the microwave later, it was still better than corporate chain subs. Like, even the leftovers were good. And if you've got a hankering for something a bit lighter, they have a couple vegetarian items as well. Whatever you get, it's going to taste great with their amazing, perfectly toasty bread.

Like many cool spots in Tempe, it's open hella late. Until 2am. So if you've got late night munchies, look no further. I could totally chomp down on these after a night of heavy drinking. ;-)"}
{"text":"Hangover Hoagies has THE BEST SUBS hands down.  Not even a comparison to Jimmy Johns, Subway or Silver Mine.  The meat is amazing and the bread, I just can't get enough.  I always get my subs toasted and no matter what, they are simply amazing.  Their footlong hoagie is enough for 2+ meals!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent hours when you're craving something late. I personally think the sand which did not have enough toppings to be close to $10 for a 12 inch. However, I did split the sand which with a friend and it left us satisfied.

I think extra for the amount of avocado you get is not right."}
{"text":"I was on grub hub tonight and wanted to try something new so I decided to give this place a shot. I got the Inebriated Sub and it has to be one of the best subs I have ever had. It was a perfect sandwich, all of the ingredients are perfectly portioned and distributed and the bread was spot on. I feel like I missed out because I've been passing this place every day for years on my way to/from work. You guys just got another regular!"}
{"text":"So I've been near this location a few times and have always told myself that I need to try it. Today I was craving a sandwhich and work was busy so I'm SOOOOOO happy they we're on Uber eats!!! I do not regret the 13 dollars I paid for the combo and knowing it'll be even less in store is LEGIT! I got the six inch boozy sub. I thought it was going to just be a 12 inch cut in half but it was just a small full roll and it was so adorable I didn't even wanna eat it . The sandwhich was nice and soft and loaded with flavor! Thanks guys for a great eat!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Chicken Pesto Bomb, Mouthwatering Fusion, and a DD Veggie. All of the sandwiches were made on fresh, delicious sandwich rolls. And, when they say 12\" they mean 12\", two of the three were actually a little bit longer than that. The ingredients were fresh, quality and delicious versions of everything promised. We also ordered the Loaded Salad, and it was tasty, cold (very important for a meatless salad in the desert!!), and all of the items had that crisp, green, moist crunch. It was well worth ordering, and we will definitely choose them again. Their cookies make a great finish, for those who enjoy a little sweetie, and we particularly recommend the Coconut Pecan."}
{"text":"Great good at a great price. Staff is super friendly and accommodating. This is my new favorite sandwich shop in Tempe."}
{"text":"not only do I love ya but I was able to place the order by phone that way it was ready forpick-upupon arrival which is very beneficial when you have other things that you need to attend"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. It's a sandwich spot inside a liquor store... I was second guessing it but I'm glad I tried it. I got the Italian and it wasn't short of good. Prices are reasonable. The sandwich did the job."}
{"text":"Sandwich was really good. Would highly recommend this for lunch or a late night snack if you are in Scottsdale area. I like the name of the establishment as well. Very clever on sandwich names as well. Enjoyed reading the menu."}
{"text":"Big sandwiches. Not much menu variety. Tastes fine, nothing wrong with the sandwiches. If you're not the first/only person in line then leave. The wait is extremely long. 
 Next time I'll call order in ahead of time. Would recommend trying but only if you have time to wait."}
{"text":"Went here because I thought the reviews and pictures of the sandwiches looked amAAAZing. Sooo sad that when I finally got it home and took the first bite, it was less than sub par. Was really looking forward to it being a great sandwich based on reviews. I ate the whole thing be grudgingly because I had already paid for it. I got the wheat bread and it had a weird taste and the texture was off too. Yuk! Tasted like store-bought loaf bread.  I have to say I definitely won't be back; was not good at all. Hate to say it but comparatively speaking as far as price and quality is concerned-Subway has them beat. and that's saying a lot because I don't even like to eat Subway like that!"}
{"text":"They have amazing very kind staff! They have a simple but inclusive menu and funny names which enhances my experience"}
{"text":"Working in customer service myself I understand the difference between good and bad service. The gentleman who helped us behind the counter at about 1 in the morning last night was by far the best customer service I have received in a very long time. Not only did he ask me and my girlfriend what we wanted but he suggested new things and was so polite about everything that we asked. He went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and because of that I'll be coming back on a regular basis now just because of the customer service. The food itself was excellent and very cheap for the quality. Great food and a fantastic customer service experience. Italian hoagie with feta and olives is very good. When I tipped him he thought it was too much to tip, that is how nice this gentleman was. New favorite spot now."}
{"text":"I love hole in the wall places like this one.  This is one of the best sub spots in the city, if not, the best spot in the city.

You'll find it in NE corner of Apache & Terrace, in a liquor store of all places.  There is no sign outside for Hangover Hoagies but right when you walk into the liquor store you will see it directly to your left.

This was a nice Entertainment book find for me.  The food here is awesome!  They use great ingredients here so I think any sub you choose will be great..  The portions are huge.  Their large is 3 meals for me.  

They don't have much table to eat in and unless you enjoy the ambiance of the light glistening off the bottles of alcohol.  I recommend doing take out.

The only grip I have about this place was I went there several times before their post closed times and they were closed.  The owner was real cool though cause he hooked my bf and I up with some free subs for the inconvenience so there is no real gripes I have about this place :)

I only hope to find a place like this in San Diego.  Or else I may just have to go back to AZ to get me a good sub."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches.  I found Hangover Hoagies on yelp and decided to try it based on reviews and photos.

I ordered a veggie sub and all of the ingredients were crisp and FRESH.  They even had sprouts.  If you follow produce, many of the larger sub shops are no longer carrying them. The bread was soft and fluffy as well.  We ordered online and the order was ready on time, with all extra items (cookies and chips) in the bag.  I didn't go inside to get the order so I cant attest to the aesthetics of the place.  But, for your reference, Hangover Hoagies is inside of a liquor store, so don't miss it looking for large signage.
