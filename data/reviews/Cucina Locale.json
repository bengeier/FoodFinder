{"text":"Came here after reading a few reviews.  I ordered the steak sandwich ($8.95) + hot peppers ($0.90) + mushrooms ($1.00), total was $12.26.  Nothing really special about the sandwich.   It was average at best.  Nothing really stood out.  I have had other steak sandwiches from other places and they were just has good and a bit cheaper as well.   The hot peppers were not hot at all.  The size of the sandwich was average as well.  Not too small not to big.  Steak was thinly sliced and cooked pretty good.  But could've put in a extra piece or two. .lol  It took about 5minutes to prepare my order.  It took me just under 3 minutes to finish it.  That kind of gives you an idea of how big the sandwich was and/or how fast I eat.  LOL  I did see someone eating the grill chicken sandwich and that looked pretty good.     If I do go back,  i will order that next time."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Italian food I've had in along time. To start, the atmosphere was very authentic and welcoming and coupled with great service it made for a very enjoyable experience. Our server Amanda was very personable and friendly. The start of the show however was the food. I ordered the locale risotto and was amazed by how good it was . We were also lucky to get there on off hours so our food was delivered quickly. Great hidden gem if you're in the area.  Would highly recommend you go in if you're passing by."}
{"text":"Pizza was just ok. Ordered take out. Pizza was cold after 10 mins. Was looking forward to trying this place but not sure we'd go back."}
{"text":"Great local Italian food. Had the steak sandwich and the veggie pizza and both tasted authentic and delicious. The steak was marinated well and full of flavor. Tomato sauce was divine.  The pizza was crispy, thin and the veggies were all fresh. I definitely would come back to try their other items!"}
{"text":"come here every now and then for a pizza. It is some of the best thin crust pizza around. They also make a pretty damn good espresso too! It does get a little stuffy during busy hours specifically lunch. The fact that it is small makes the place a little more enjoyable just make sure you get there early so you can get a table. Also parking can be a pain as its literally right on highway 7."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, find myself in there at least every other week. Ingredients are always fresh, service is great, and the food is amazing! Really love the meatball sandwich but my favourite is definitely the salciccia pizza (gnocchi with vodka sauce is also a great choice). I've lived in Markham for awhile and could never find a great pizza joint but haven't had a pizza from anywhere else in almost a year. Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff that wanted to make sure everything was fine and great food. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends to have some tasty Italian food based on the reviews. Yummy food for a great price.  The restaurant is small so I would recommend a reservation.  After we left, the owner thought there were no more business so he closed.  After we left, more groups of people came so he reopened the restaurant.    Food:  We tried the lasagna, locale pizza, salsiccia pizza, funghi risotto and locale risotto.  All were well done and freshly made to order.  My favourite was the funghi risotto and the locale pizza.   Will definitely return to try more dishes.    Decor: Small quaint restaurant with open kitchen.  Seating is comfortable and can house a big group."}
{"text":"I came in on a busy Friday for lunch and the crowd was a mix between office workers, students, and a table of executives sipping espressos, which looked encouraging.   Originally I was going to get the veal sandwich but opted for the Margherita pizza instead. It was tasty and crust was crisp, but could have used less corn meal on the bottom.   Would come again for a quick lunch stop with friends though the service and decor isn't good enough for a dinner."}
{"text":"Owner had a bad attitude, swears a lot, even in front of children.   Saw him kick out a table of 10 because the waitress wasn't competent enough to bring enough ice to their table. Owner didn't take any accountability for the staff.   Lots of swearing by the owner, didn't feel safe in this restaurant, will not be going back.  Poor customer service. His review is a one because it can't be lower."}
{"text":"Great food! The owner has some real Italian flare which is fun and it really feels like a mom and pop joint :)   I feel like the pizza crust could be a bit thicker in the middle as you have to eat the middle with a fork and knife because you can't pick up that part of the pizza. The outer edge however is delicious. Regardless of the middle is a bit soggy the toppings still taste just as good as in Italy.  The blue cheese Gorgonzola cream with pasta was superb. The penne was cooked al dente just as it should.  I've also had the caprese which is great.  The veal sandwich is not my favorite but it's not super salty which is due to a great marinara sauce!  Will definitely be back to try other things on their menu! Maybe risotto!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really good. Would definitely order the pizza again. Like that it's thin crust and right out of the oven. Staffs were really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I love the food, but could you turn up the heat in the restaurant?  I'm always freezing to death and my food gets cold super fast!"}
{"text":"I was waiting to be seated for an uncomfortably long time. I had made reservations for two and I arrived early by 10 minutes. The waitress was chatting with a customer so I stood by the door waiting for her to finish. I made sure to make eye contact with her so she knew I was waiting. She glanced at me a couple times but didn't seat me. Finally, I just walked towards her and asked if I should just grab a seat. She apologized saying she didn't know I was waiting.. At last I was seated and waited for my friend to arrive. My friend came late but the waitress was quick to see if were ready to order. She answered our questions about the menu items to the best of her abilities, I guess.  We ordered a caprese salad to share. There were 3 pairs of mozzarella and tomato slices, thickly cut so it didn't look visually appealing. I ordered the Locale pizza which I thought tasted quite good where it was crispy. There was a concentration of the oil from the pesto drizzle in the centre of the pizza so it fell apart as soon as I tried to pick up a slice. It was likely more moist from the cheese and tomato ingredients. I didn't mind the soggy centre too too much because the pizza tasted good. My friend ordered a penne with vodka sauce. It didn't come with much protein other than a sprinkle of pancetta. She said her pasta was overly salty.  We went to the counter to pay our bill so we could leave. A man who seemed to be the owner or manager gave us a lot of attitude when we asked if we could split the bill (splitting the salad and an entree per person). I don't know how he calculated the totals because when I did my own calculations, the numbers don't match. I ordered a 16.00 pizza and wanted to split the 7.75 salad, which should give me a total of $19.86 or $22.46 tax included. However, the total punched into the debit machine read $24.25, so by the time I reluctantly left my obligatory tip, I had almost spent $30. Then he conveniently became busy in the kitchen area when I wanted to ask about the price punched in. Even if it was an honest mistake on the owner/manager's part, I still wouldn't come back. I'd much rather spend $30 on a nice dinner with good service on Main Street, Unionville."}
{"text":"Not sure how I haven't been here before, since I do live so close, but it was one of those places that was just okay.  Came in for a quick meal and was seated pretty quickly. The food options were pretty simple and we got a pizza and a risotto. Both were pretty good, but the pizza was pretty oily and greasy, and the risotta was quite a small portion (especially for the price you were paying).  Service was pretty good overall, as the one waitress did do her job, but had to be asked a few times to do certain tasks that should have been done already (wiping down the table, bringing water). The owner sat down with another table and was quite loud with them at one point, but I didn't experience any of the other horrors that other yelpers were speaking of.  Good overall, but not itching to be back any time soon."}
{"text":"We're back on the HUNT for Toronto's BEST! Stop #2 of the pizza pie tour: Cucina Locale  This time we ventured north of Toronto to Markham. Cucina Locale is a proud to be Italian restaurant along Highway 7. They appear to specialize in Italian sandwiches, pasta, and of course, pizza. The restaurant has a good amount of seating, so go ahead and bring a mid sized group for dinner.  Before I get into the food, the service at Cucina Locale is close to my heart. I'm about -20% Italian, but from start to finish, the staff will make you feel like you're around friends, and the food will have you thinking that your nonna made it. I'd just avoid taking too many candid photos of the place/staff, or you'll get some sass for it.  When it came to the pizza, I grabbed myself the Locale. As the name of the restaurant suggests, they stake their pizza claim on this pie. The locale is a thin crust pizza, with parmigiano, buffalo mozzarella (whatever that is), prosciutto, extra virgin olive oil, and a basil pesto drizzle. What can't be denied about the pizzas at Cucina Locale is that they're FRESH to def! You get that grandmother feel because from the freshly baked crust to the vividly flavourful prosciutto, the ingredients assure you that they were recently prepared. I don't know what food that's actually from Italy tastes like, but this place makes you wonder. That being said, there's more to a drop dead amazing pizza than outright freshness. The Locale is a great pizza with classic, simple flavours, but it doesn't have the legs to be the best. Shout out to that prosciutto though. It was a stellar addition to the pie, giving it bouts of vibrant, salty flavour that sits on your pallet long after the meal. They would definitely not do themselves wrong adding more of that cured ham.  Word to the wise; eat the pies from Cucina Locale fast. They prepare them fresh for a reason, and you'll be missing out on their best feature if you dilly dally. Come through to Cucina for a delightful dinner and stellar service!"}
{"text":"Tiny little place in Markham- however it does feel really Italian.  I headed over there as a I was craving California Sandwich and this was the only thing I could find. This is where the comparison stops even though they are both cutlet sanwiches.  At Cucino the cook will char the chicken a bit and then bread it and then pan fry it- the results are amazing.  Kudos to that hot sauce- Was really good.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Been going here for quite a while now but recently have been disappointed. The owner is super friendly and great with kids. You can tell he's passionate about his food. However, the past few months he's had some turnover in the kitchen and the new guy (Indian dude) doesn't cut it.   Our past two visits were a disaster. We usually order 2 pizzas and two pastas and a Caesar salad. One time our food took over 2 hours! to come because the new guy couldn't keep up. Yesterday (Friday evening) half our party had the runs after dinner.   I'd recommend only coming on non peak times where the owner is the only chef. Will be giving Cucina Locale a break and won't be coming back until late summer. Hopefully they have some new staff by then."}
{"text":"We have been dining at Cucina Locale since it opened and we still enjoy every meal there. Great service, Graciano (sp) the owner always prepares our orders and he's a perfectionist. We've dined in and called for take out.   Pizza, sandwiches, salads, pasta specials are all delicious. My daughter loves the lasagna. We've tried most of the items as the menu is not huge but enough variety and everything has been great. Espresso is good. Wine list could be expanded.   The restaurant is not big so it's a great cozy atmosphere and we will consider booking the entire restaurant for special events."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to try this restaurant as their website and Yelp advertised that they're open Saturdays from 11:00am - 9:00pm but when I tried to go for lunch today (Saturday), they were closed until dinnertime.  It is so important for business information to be updated online; please ensure your website contains accurate hours of operation so this doesn't happen to others!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant has some really good thin crust pizzas and Italian sandwiches!  It's small, but cozy and the service is friendly.  Other than avoiding high traffic times on Hwy 7, we definitely like to come here as their prices are quite good."}
{"text":"Simple and good Italian food at reasonable price and good service.  Nothing fancy but just a good meal in a comfortable environment."}
{"text":"This is a nice small family owned Italian restaurant in Unionville. Food was awesome and the prices were very reasonable. Went with a group of friends and we ordered several dishes to share including the lasagna, ravioli, gnocchi, salsiccia pizza with the spicy italian sausage and the margherita pizza. All these dishes were sharable dishes and were delicious. I really enjoyed the salsiccia pizza the most out of all the dishes and the ravioli was quite nice. The amount of food you get for the price you pay is worth the trip to this restaurant. We also ordered drinks and the beer was quite cheap. Staff were friendly and the restaurant gives you that comfort food like feeling. Overall, a great little family owned Italian restaurant that I would recommend to others. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars. Cucina Locale is small restaurant serving up decent Italian food. My experience was mostly pleasant but I neither impressed nor disappointed in the food. It was simply average. We came for lunch and ordered the margherita pizza, the veal sandwich, and the lasagna.   The pizza was easily the best dish we had. The (thin) crust was crispy and the sauce wasn't salty, which is a huge plus. The basil pesto drizzle increased the aromatics of the dish and the buffalo cheese was great. Overall, it was a nice and light pizza. The veal sandwich was a tad disappointing. The breaded veal were a bit dry and there was a 'sheet' of veal that was rather tough. The lasagna was alright but I was really taken back by the small portion size of it. It's not justifiable for $14. The lasagna was definitely fresh, but was lackluster in terms of cheese and while the tomato sauce was really good, it was only lukewarm.   The value could have been a lot more fair. Especially compared to a place like Lamanna's Bakery down south, Cucina Locale could do a lot better to increase their portion size. Service was fine and the man that served us was nice. Decor was homey and Italian themed. Overall while I wasn't too impressed with their lasagna and sandwiches, I'll definitely return to Cucina Locale to have their Italian style pizzas."}
{"text":"Tried the italian sausage with sun dried tomatoes and their \"locale\" pizza.  Very good. Maybe we were hungry but it smelt amazing. Not too salty but still flavourful. The sundried tomatoes was a nice play off the spicy sausage. The locale was relatively lighter but still tasty with the parm. The crust was crisp and chewy and nice and thin.  It's pricier than most but it's unique in an area that 99% asian food. Will have to go back to try the sandwiches which are much more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Been opened for a few years, Cucina Locale is a beautiful, small, intimate Italian restaurant that's serving classic dishes. Coming here as a first timer, I was impressed! The food, rustic Italian decor, open concept kitchen felt like home. Oh and if it's a great day do take advantage of their small patio out the front, however seating is limited.  Veal sandwich was a 4/5  delicious, not salty and marinara sauce is not acidic.  Penne gorganzola 5/5 decadent, penne was cooked perfectly al dente, portions are more than enough, and reasonable! One advise, add some fresh chopped parsley to dress it up as the dish looked plain  Locale pizza 4.5 perfect balance of flavors, didn't go too overboard with the pesto sauce, thin gourmet made to perfection, well presented, and overall good portion for what you pay.   Great place, great food and sarcastically comical owner who creates a fun customer experience."}
{"text":"Just found this little place, great za and sandwiches. Nice place got lunch , definitely drop in"}
{"text":"I went for lunch.  Food was ok. That's all I can day about it. Nothing special. Food was lukewarm. There weren't that many people eating in the restaurnt for lunch on a weekday.   I ordered the lasagna which was ok. Portion size was small considering how much it costed.   Pizza was bland. Tomato sauce had no flavour. The only thing good was that it was fresh out of the oven.   Veal sandwich was soggy. Veal tasted off.  I won't come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Where do you have to go to get a veal sangwich in this town?  I've often asked myself this question. I finally found the answer. Chicano Locale has rustic style Italian sandwiches and great pizzas. Perfect place to pick up a satisfying lunch when you can't make it to your nonna's house. I wouldn't recommend dining in as it is small and a little chilly. But the ingredients are fresh and the food is great. Closest thing to College street sandwich bars right here in Markham.  Family run. Authentic. Delish. Trust me. I know Italian!"}
{"text":"We had great service, well tended to. Food was reasonably priced and delicious. We were happy with all of our dishes. It's a small restaurant with a cozy feel."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night at around 7:30pm. Parking can be a problem if it were more busy. There is are very few parking spots available. The restaurant itself is small and cozy. It looked like a one man show running the whole place. He was the chef, the server and the cashier. There were a total of three tables being served including ourselves. Service was good considering the one man staff. However, you got to waive him down to get service otherwise he is just too busy doing other things.   Lasagna $12.95 - top layer of lasagna had what seemed like bacon which went well with it. The lasagna was simple with tomato/meat sauce and cheese. The pasta layers were soft and slicing the lasagna was like cutting into soft butter. Overall, tasted good.  Risotto $15.95  - mixed in with the risotto were small chunks of meat that tasted like sausage meat. The pasta was very creamy and tasted good. I'd rather pay $4 more and get the scallop risotto at Novita.   Decent and simple Italian food."}
{"text":"Visited here for dinner on a recent Saturday night around 7pm.  Just as we entered, a table with two patrons just came available, so we were lucky to be able to get a seat.  The place is small and was packed.  Glancing at orders as the food was being served made us extra hungry as everything looked absolutely delicious!  We decided on a caprese salad to share which was absolutely delicious.  I ordered a margherita pizza and my husband a chicken sandwich.  The food took way. too. long.  We understand as there is just one guy cooking and another guy serving, taking care of tables etc, but the wait was so long and we were starving in anticipation of our mains.  Finally it arrived and at first glance I was a tad disappointed in my pizza... the basil pesto olive oil added by the server was in puddles on the pizza...this sopped through and made the dough all soggy.  I have to say it TASTED good, however was a mess to eat ( you couldn't pick up a slice as it would fall apart).  The sauce was delicious...  My husband enjoyed his chicken sandwich and he, as an Italian, with a mom who is an amazing cook, stated the food was \"just like ma-ma makes\".    The two guys that run the joint are really nice, friendly.  Prices are very reasonable.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Closed now! Will miss the boss who told me he used arborio rice when he made my risotto. We need more quality Italian restaurants in Markham, not fewer!"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for pizza and I decided to look for something in the area that wasn't the usual chains. I have driven by this place all the time (it is on highway 7) but this was my first time eating here. All in all, it wasn't too bad, but the layout was a bit confusing so I wasn't sure how to order/pay the bill.  Staff: When I walked in I wasn't sure if we were to order up at the front order, seat ourselves, or wait for someone to seat us. Eventually a gentleman peeked his head through from the kitchen and offered us a seat. They definitely could benefit from an extra staff member or two. I know it wasn't busy, but having one person cook, take orders, set up the tables, and handle the register caused the service to be lacking. But I will say that the food came out very quickly and the gentleman was very friendly.  Ambience: When you walk in there are tables and you can see the kitchen. It's small to moderate size but still plenty of space and tables. The parking lot is tiny and it is a bit hard to get to if there's lots of traffic on Highway 7 (I almost overshot it as I drove). It's got a modern Italian restaurant feel to it.  Food: I ordered the Tradizionale pizza. My initial reaction was that the peppers were huge! I didn't mind, but I surely didn't expect them to be so big. I ended up eating it when a knife and fork because it was a thin crust. It was what I would imagine an Italian home cooked meal would be like. The flavours were spot on, the crust was good, the toppings were just right. And I was so full by the end of it!  Definitely a good place to go if you're craving Italian in the area!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to writing a nice review of a GTA restaurant, unfortunately that won't be the case on this occasion. We had eaten here twice previously, and now I know it was only because we had not met \"the owner\" until tonight. I was there with my family in-law, there were nine of us including three children. My husband returned a can of pop because he had asked for ice three times, and no longer felt like waiting for it. The owner came to the table looking upset, because my husband had given HIM the can of pop back. I am still in shock at what took place next. Instead of apologizing, he began to lecture my husband by saying that if he was not happy with the service he should return the can of pop to the server and complain to him because HE is \"the owner\" and my husband should not be returning the can directly to HIM. I asked him if that was his idea of an apology and said that I couldn't believe his attitude. Does it matter if he's \"the owner\"? Owners are too good to apologize? And I guess we are supposed to know that HE is \"the owner\" because he was wearing an apron?  Lamentably, it did not end there. Naturally, due to this poor treatment, we got up to leave. He followed us to the door in an effort to escort us out and save face in front of his customers. He said loudly that we were not welcome at his restaurant. As we were walking out I mentioned to him that good owners need to have good manners and good customer service. I guess he didn't like that, and began kicking me out with profanity. He was now screaming and swearing in front of all his customers, including children. He even followed us outside and began muttering insults, swear words, and racial slurs in Italian. Only a coward behaves like this. My husband's family is Chinese, and unfortunately for him I speak Italian. So I went back into the restaurant to let him and his customers know that he was racist and a terrible person. Obviously, this man is not mentally stable, or something very bad is going on in his life, but you cannot take it out on your customers. I cannot in good conscience recommend this place to anyone, being rude and ignorant is bad enough, but I draw the line at racism; and given what happened tonight I would ask others to boycott this establishment."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try Cucina Locale. It is a nice small place with tables close together. When you are ready to order you go to the counter. I ordered the veal sandwich with added provolone cheese, mushrooms and onions. My wife had the risotto dinner special. Both of us found the food good but not wow good. We also found the price a bit high. If we do go back it will be to try the pizza since they looked good."}
{"text":"Never witnessed such a disgraceful level of service in my life. The portly 'owner' cursed me out of the restaurant for returning a lukewarm Soft Drink after requesting ice 3x then shooed my entire family out of the dump with a hail of cursing that carried out into the parking lot. Needless to say that being with my family yielded a muted response on my part. Obviously won't be returning and will warn anyone against dining here. I really thought that his table side visit would net an apology and willingness to make things right."}
{"text":"A nice small gem for italian food!  Location/decor: - The restaurant is a small little building on the south side of Hwy 7 and it is a bit tough to spot if you are driving by the strip plaza (right by Mr Jerk) - Due to the size, parking is quite limited - Inside, you'll find a quaint laid back interior with enough seating for 15 or so people. Great place to chat and catch up without being drowned out by noise - The kitchen is visible from the counter so you can easily see and smell the great food cooking up.  Food: - We had a pizza craving and decided to order types of pizza: Napoli and Locale - Portions were big for individual sized pizzas - The pizzas had a nice thin crust with chewy dough without being overly thin and dried out. Topping were excellent - I loved my Napoli with anchovies, mozzarella  and tomatoes. The Locale was very tasty as well with big slices of proscuitto and buffalo mozzarella. Both were a definite hit. - We didn't get a chance to try the sandwiches or pasta but while we were waiting I could see him cooking the pasta and it smelled great.  In general, Cucina is a great little Italian gem that makes for a casual dinner with tasty food. Prices are very reasonable and we will definitely return to try the rest of the food."}
{"text":"I have urges for Home made Meat Balls Sandwich ($6.25) and I am excited that Cucina Locale, a new Italian sandwiches and pizza place opens in my neighborhood.   Menu is simple, great for a quick bite anytime of the day.  Messy with tomato sauce dripping everywhere...in a good delicious way. Meatballs were nice and moist inside a warm toasted bun. The tomato sauce has this nice aroma without being over salted which I hated.  Toppings aside from hot pepper which is free, cost $1 or so extra.  Fresh ingredients and friendly service.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Having grown up on Italian steak and veal sandwiches, I was excited to hear about Cucina Locale. My girlfriend and I ordered several items off the menu, and I have to say, I was extremely surprised.  First off, don't go by the prices on their website. At first glance $6.95 for a steak sandwich is a great deal, but once we went in to the restaurant and saw $9.95 on the sign, it was a bit of a surprise. Not to mention it costs extra for each topping.   I wouldn't mind paying more money for great food, but the steak sandwich was just awful. Maybe I'm a bit jaded having grown up on Italian sandwiches from downtown Toronto, but these don't even compare.  For 10 bucks at Tony & Nick's San Fransisco Sandwiches, you can get an amazing steak sandwich with all the toppings you want. The meat here was thick and stringy with absolutely no flavor. It reminded me of the meat you find in those Swanson dinner trays.  The pizza was a pretty big letdown as well. For $4.99 I could get a better tasting pie at Pizza Pizza. The sauce was alright but the cheese tasted the Mozzarella balls you buy for 3 bucks at No Frills.   As much as I'd love to support a local family business, I came away disappointed, and I can guarantee I won't be back."}
{"text":"I talked my co-workers into coming to Cucina Locale with me, because I knew I couldn't finish a pizza myself.  Sure enough, the portion is big.  The three of us, 2 women and 1 man, shared 2 pizzas, and we were full.  The pizzas were nice - the dough was fresh, the sauce tasted bold, the crust was a bit too soft as if it wasn't cooked long enough or the stove wasn't hot enough, the toppings were on the skimpy side; I wish there was more toppings (see picture of Locale pizza).    The store is small and cozy.  The interior decor is modern and pleasing.  There is an open kitchen which I like.  The pizza at Cucina is slightly on the pricey side.  Nonna's on Hwy 48 is almost $2 cheaper per pizza.  This location is more convenient to me, though.  Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Just had my first experience at Cucina Locale tonight, and it will not be my last!  I had the Funghi pizza and was extremely impressed. The service was warm and welcoming, the food was fresh delicious, and quick! I've been looking for a fantastic pizza place in Markham and I've found it in Cucina Locale. They're LLBO licensed which is a definitely plus. I highly recommend anyone who loves good, fresh, authentic Italian food to go check it out!"}
{"text":"If you want a real food don't look any further just go there and I'm sure you will not be disappointed great food and great service they make the best t pizza in Markham."}
