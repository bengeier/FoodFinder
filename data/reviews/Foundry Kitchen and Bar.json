{"text":"I had to edit my initial review, my original brunch experience was not good, and we may never return for brunch, but I went for dinner and was very pleased. Food was very good and the service was amazing. Our server helped me get the special on my husband's to go order even though it was an eat in only special. Also I highly recommend the fried pickles. I'm only giving 4 stars since our brunch experience was so terrible or it would be 5 stars"}
{"text":"Has potential, not terrible, not awesome, but still probably better than most restaurant options in Elyria. 

I stopped in at the bar for a beer and a burger. I expected more people given the day and time of our visit. The service was definitely lacking, even sitting at the bar where staff congregated. The bar tender spent the majority my visit talking with one customer and forgot a drink order. In general, it just felt like the staff had a ''meh\" attitude. When visiting a restaurant, I enjoy interacting with staff members who for lack of a better term, give a shit, and genuinely care about making my experience memorable. 

I'm pretty certain a member of management or ownership was sitting nearby at the bar drinking alcohol, going behind the bar getting drinks as they pleased. Otherwise, someone was just helping themselves. Everyone is free to run their own business as they please, but to me personally as a customer bringing in revenue, it doesn't look good. It just left a bad taste, like a Bar Rescue episode in the making. 

The burger itself was okay. Slightly overcooked and no memorable flavors that made me want to go back for more. Nothing about it knocked my socks off. The burger arrived with an extra topping that I didn't order. Not a big deal because I can just take it right off, but I appreciate attention to detail. Would I still go back and get it over the other nearby restaurant options? Yes, but there's room for improvement. 

Solid beer and cocktail menu, exactly as I expected walking in the door. There was a solid mix of everything. 

The atmosphere was really outstanding and more pleasant than expected. It felt much trendier than anything I've seen in Elyria, something that you'd expect to see in Ohio City or Tremont. Really, from this perspective, it's a breath of fresh air to the downtown area. Especially considering the type of establishments that once lined the street. 

Overall, while I wasn't entirely pleased with this visit, the restaurant has some serious potential. I will return in time to try a different variety of food and I hope to see improvements."}
{"text":"Had lunch here twice recently. Both times service was less than average. Small side of fries cost $4.00 and Diet Pepsi was $2.25. Nice looking place. Will try the bar some night."}
{"text":"Had the salmon twice and each time it was significantly overcooked.   I ordered it medium rare each time (pink inside) and it was well done both times.  Staff did not even check on how it was until they collected the plates once we were all done.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"I usually only comment or Yelp on \"really great\" or \"really bad\" experiences, this one was bad.
 Overpriced, slow service, cold overcooked food, gristly meat... Just a disappointing .......hot mess. 
 I'd steer clear for a bit, till they learn to give a crap about the people who come to spend money here. 
  You've been warned!
 I think this is all I need to say."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Good food. The wait staff leaves a lot to be desired. We've been here twice. I want to like this place. We need more good independently owned options in Lorain County. I will be back. I am hoping my rating improves. There is SO much potential here, and there is a community of local people who want this establishment to thrive. We want to see all of our downtowns humming and thriving."}
{"text":"Great little spot in an up and coming neighborhood.  Food and service were both good."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place and visually I did but unfortunately, most of the food is lacking in flavor. I appreciated the drink menu and found the mixed drinks to be tasty. The deep fried pickles were some of the best I have tasted. They weren't too greasy or overly breaded.

The rest of the food was just okay after that. I ordered a small BBQ pizza and I wish I would have been able to taste the BBQ. There was a drizzle over the top and that was it. Someone at my table ordered the Mac N Cheese and it tasted like eating paper. It had absolutely zero taste to it. How does something made with cheese have no flavor?! 

I was disappointed by the overall taste of the food but I feel like this place has a lot of potential and I hope they do well."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were both excellent.  Our server Kelly was excellent as well.  I highly recommend Foundry.  The meatloaf was amazing!

Six months later I am sad to report the food has gone downhill.  The calamari was so over cooked we had to send it back.  The wings were a bit on the slimy side and the French fries were majorly undercooked.  Hoping they get their act together because we really like this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great! It's got great beer and bourbon selection. The food is terrific and our service was awesome as well. We will make sure to come back and visit"}
{"text":"Ordered the fried pickles, the breading was mushy on the inside. I stated we didn't like them... the server didn't ask why, just took them away. I expected the food to be very flavorful and the drinks to be good. But chopped up brown apples in my drink was not very appealing. I would say this place is in the same category as an Applebee's. The interior is great... but $40 for lunch here... never again. 
Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for casual dining. We had fried pickles the breading was ok but it was greasy. We had the Cuban is was good. We had Hamburger it was delicious. The fries were very greasy. Overall with friendly staff ...three star"}
{"text":"Nice bar and atmosphere, gave me the feel similar to the new age bars with a better than bar food menu but still had a traditional sense to it. 

CRABCAKES! Never would I have expected good crab cakes from Elyria Ohio but this place got it right. Not filled with stuffing (like most places) and was served with beautiful presentation.

The strip steak was decent, potatoes were good, greens were cooked but had bacon in it. Overall for the steak dish I'd say average nothing special. Would want to try their crazy burgers that are mixed with half beef and half bacon or chorizo. Yummmm"}
{"text":"Good beer selection,  service is adequate,  food is average but over priced.  I've had a couple of the appetizers, pizza and a salad."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff.  Kyle is amazing knows customers, runs his butt off to keep order at the bar and servers happy."}
{"text":"Three of us went today for the first time today. I was skeptical at first. The first positive was the 5.00 mules!!!  The decor was very nice! They have a fun private room I plan on booking! So onto the food... looking at the menu there were so many things I wanted to try! So we all picked an appetizer. They were all good but the deviled eggs were the biggest hit!!! We then all decided on lobster bisque. It was good... could of been warmer... but ok. The caprese salad was great and half size was huge!  Service was great and I can't wait to take my husband there!"}
{"text":"Found The Foundry to be a good experience. Our waitress Kelly was very nice and made suggestions. Bartender Kyle also very pleasant. Dinners were prepared as stated and arrived hot. Will be back again soon.

Accidentally, left my credit card - it was locked up and checked my ID before returning it - disaster avoided"}
{"text":"Huge improvement from when it used to be Moss'. Really nice selection of local beers on tap, very friendly service, and delicious food. We enjoy sitting at the bar; all of the bartenders are super friendly and attentive -- particularly Kyle! 

Nachos are my favorite food (don't judge) and the Foundry has the BEST nachos in the area. I like them even better than the wild boar nachos at El Carnicero. We've also had the chicken and waffle pizza, the tuna wontons, the Elyrian, and the turkey croissant and all of it was great. My husband ordered the burger that's half ground bacon and half ground beef (yep, that's a thing) one visit and it was way too rich for him, which is saying a lot, but everything else has exceeded expectations. I'm really glad that there is a unique, aesthetically beautiful sports bar in Elyria now."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. Fantastic beer list. Overall, I'm extremely pleased and will definitely be back when I'm in the area again. 

The carnivore pizza was really good and had so much meat on it, I left with the meat sweats.

Definitely try it sometime if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"We came here for our daughter's 16th birthday. The atmosphere is fantastic - rustic wood married to industrial chic. The food is really good. I had the NY strip, which came in at $11 for 8 ounces. It was perfectly cooked and accompanied by the tastiest Yukon potatoes I have ever had. The kids had burgers, the buffalo chicken sandwich, and the chicken and waffles. All four of them gave it two thumbs up. 

It's a good value, great food kind of place. For 8 of us, the bill was less than $100."}
{"text":"I visited over the holidays when I was back home in Elyria and I was pleasantly surprised to find such a good restaurant in downtown Elyria!  The food was quite delicious and very reasonably priced.  I ordered the grilled romaine salad and the salmon; both were just what I wanted and tasted great.  My family also enjoyed their meals.  My only reason for giving it 4 out of 5 stars is that the service took longer than I'd have liked.  Otherwise this place comes highly recommended and just what Elyria needs!"}
{"text":"This is the first review of a brand new restaurant in Elyria which opened only yesterday. Our appetizer, the Fresh Pretzels, were far from fresh. They had been split and grilled. Tasted days old. My hubby's Lasagne Deconstructed was flavorful but on the dry side. My steak was an 8 oz Hand Cut NY Strip. It was cooked as I had ordered. The Rosemary garlic smashed yukons were good and the Brussels sprouts with Panchetta were delicious. Dessert was the Pizel Napoleon. A very light and tasty treat. Giving that they have only been open the sum of one day I will most certainly come back and give them another try or two to see how things progress. We need another good restaurant in Elyria!!"}
{"text":"Do: enjoy the the fresh, cleanness and the new wood smell of this place.
Do not: get the Mac N Cheese. It's a pile of tasteless mush that I had to send back.  
Do: get the beer battered fried pickles they are some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Service was pretty bad. The waitress was on her phone, texting or something, rather than getting refills for us. My fries never came out with my Reuben. My mom ordered home fries, she was given chips instead and her home fries never came out. Had to get up and walk my empty glass to her to get a refill. Won't be back here ever again."}
{"text":"Food is average. Atmosphere nice. I've been here about 6 times and each time food got worse. Only thing I'd get if I went back would be a burger."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing location. But that's the only thing going for it in my opinion. Service is spotty every time we come. I think waiting 15 minutes for a draft is my favorite part  especially when there is a small crowd. the food is great if bland is your thing.  The only reason we keep coming back is because it's within walking distance of our home. The mixed drinks are good when the bartender has time to make them in between 20 minute conversations. My server did the best she could."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch on a Saturday about noon. They had a $5 burger special that included chips that hit the spot, we both ordered medium & they were cooked spot on. They also had a great soup of the day (baked potato) which makes me want to come back & try the tomato bisque with their grilled cheese.  They offered a dry cider on tap & we split the 23 oz tall for less than $2 more then the traditional 16 oz. service was fast & friendly & our orders were all correct. Love the atmosphere too, great industrial decor with metal artwork! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"1st visit B and B burger was amazing but that was to go.
 2nd visit the $14 Elyrian was pretty blah especially with the hair that came with it! I'm one for mistakes and accidents but I must say its a whole different impression when the manager never acknowledges it, the server acts like it's not a big deal and nobody even apologizes!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to splurge a little. Food is amazing, beer selection was great, and excellent decor all around.

I was thinking of giving it 4 stars for the price/value, but I think that's just thinking frugally for its location. If this was in Cleveland, Avon, or even Medina I wouldn't bat an eye at the prices.

If there is ever a full recovery for the bar/restaurant scene in downtown Elyria, I'm pretty sure people will point to Foundry as the first place to really turn it around."}
{"text":"I was on my way through town and I didn't want the usual fast food.  I'd had a terrible lunch and I had little hope that dinner would be any better, but The Foundry was a delight.  My waiter was knowledgeable and super friendly.  The steak dinner was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious and it turned my whole night around.  I definitely plan to visit again, next time I pass through."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch on my way back from Canton. Went with Parmesan garlic wings. Very good with crisp skin. Kyle was very friendly and helpfully recommended the chimichurri chicken tacos and they were outstanding. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere. The cocktails were awesome as well! Deffinately check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Foundry is something of a food oasis in a desert of chains, greasy spoons, shady dive bars and empty storefronts. We just relocated from Cleveland to North Ridgeville and I can tell you that it wasn't for the food scene. There's really nothing out here. Don't believe me? Yelp the area for yourself. I'll wait. 

I told you so. Nothing. It's like Elyria has been sprayed with restaurant repellent. Anyway, when I came across this place I was like, \"A gastropub in Elyria? Seriously?\" Well, two visits later and here we are. Is it all that and a bag of Thomasson's? Kinda.

First off, I've gotta give these guys credit. Setting up shop smack dab in the middle of old town Elyria across from the town square isn't something many entrepreneurs are clamoring to do. There's not much there. And, deciding to open up a classy, upper scale eatery on top of that? Trust me when I tell you, Elyria is about as blue collar Bud Light as you can get. I know, I was born there back in the early 70s and called it home until I was 10. It's freakin' strange coming back after so many years away. Everything's changed but it hasn't. A bizarro story for not here.

So here are the highlights:

Atmosphere - Historic building gutted, renovated. Check. Exposed brick. Check. Roughed up hardwood floors. Check. Industrial chic doodads and gadgets on display. Check. Foundry has a cozy, dimly lit, sorta speakeasy feel that I dig.

Beer/Adult Beverages - This is something Elyria desperately needed. A place that takes craft beer seriously. Foundry has nailed it on this front with a selection of 24 different taps, all craft, and a nicely curated bottles/cans list to boot. Is the local crowd into craft beer? Probably not the 50+ crowd, but the next generation certainly is. Beer not your thing? They've got plenty of uppity mixed drinks and fancy bourbons and the like, too. If you're looking to get your drink on at a bar that knows what they're doing, they'll set you up.

Service - Like others have mentioned, the service is spotty. Sure, we've only been there twice, but on both occasions drinks took forever to arrive (I could turn around and touch the bar), dirty dishes weren't cleared in a timely fashion, and our servers both times never really bothered to offer suggestions or tell us about the place when we noted it was our first time. Not bad, just not what it should be for a place like this.

Grub - The menu here reads like something out of a brewpub/gastropub how-to book. This isn't a knock, just that there aren't many surprises. It's large and in charge. Burgers, salads, pizza, entrees. Foundry takes its cue from the whole \"American comfort foods with an upscale twist\" thing. Everything we had was pretty good, with a few minor execution foibles worth mentioning. The biggest misstep is that just about everything is under seasoned. Some others include calamari that's overcooked and more breading than anything else. A \"fresh\" soft pretzel app that's anything but and an undercooked short rib topped with onion rings that were rock hard, inedible disasters.

On the positive side, the meatloaf entree was the best thing I've had there so far. More like giant meatballs set atop some roasted and smashed potatoes, but I'm splitting hairs here. And the side of pancetta Brussels sprouts, so good. The wasabi deviled eggs rock and their poutine needs to be on everyone's menu. 

A few more nit picky things:

Practically no waiting area to speak of. Unless you count the enclosed closet (the aforementioned holding pen) that's between the exit and the hostess station.

During our last visit they had apparently rented out most of the restaurant to a private party meaning we had to stand up front by the hostess for about 30 minutes waiting for a table. Perhaps when your private party is that large it's best to close the restaurant.

In Summation

Foundry is pretty good. Hell, when it comes to the area I'd even go as far as to say they're among the best. It's not like they really have any competition, though, so grain of salt and all (a little seasoning joke, there). They've just got some work to do. It's clear from the two times we've been there that people are into it. They're showing up in numbers and that's a good thing. The challenge is that Foundry is still fresh and new and in Elyria a gastropub is a novelty. For the diners of the city and, selfishly, for my sake, I hope they keep on honing their craft. They're just so damn close."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian (vegan wannabe). I asked the server what she would recommend and she told me the ratatouille. It was excellent and the serving size was perfect.  My husband had the Elyrian (philly steak type sandwich) and he loved it.  The prices are comparable to Applebee's. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, my wife and I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was wonderful. Love the sliding glass on the front of the building."}
{"text":"Really great spot. Food was really good. I had the Cubano - I might have added a sauce on the side, but it didn't hurt the experience - and my wife had the pizza. We shared. I gotta say, I'm a pizza guy and this pizza was next level. Probably the best around and I am not kidding. Service was top rate. Prices really good. Oh and try the meatloaf sliders - wow. Too much left over so we took it home. Rodney, you guys are doing an excellent job!!!"}
{"text":"So awesome to have this quality in Elyria! Service was five star thanks to Brittany-you made our evening! Bar selections were very good-loved the moscato! Food selections were very good (would be great to see daily specials for more variety...) Atmosphere amazing, especially with doors open to the outside!"}
{"text":"So happy they finally opened. Our bar staff is amazing, Roger and Kate! We are going to try their pizza. Food around us looks great! Pan-seared salmon sounds like one of the best dishes here. Love the decor. Feel very comfortable here.

Here again on 8/19. Still wonderful'"}
{"text":"Patio seating available!  Perfect day for it. Gluten free pizza was so tasty you couldn't tell it was gluten free."}
{"text":"Great industrial vibe.  Extensive bar with happy hour specials from 3-7 daily.  My husband and I got the fried pickles and the house made chips and dip as appetizers, the In Bacon We Trust burger and Chicken and Waffles for our entrees, and shared a piece of Chocolate Lucifer cake for dessert.  Everything was good, but the chips and dip and burger were exceptional.  The burger was a mix of 50% bacon and 50% ground beef--ridiculously good.  The chips were very crispy and served with a generous portion of tasty sour cream and onion dip.  Our server, Avery, was fun and attentive.  If we are in the Elyria area we will be sure to stop again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great local atmosphere. Wide selection of beers and a great variety of food. The fresh made chips were awesome with my 1/2 Beef 1/2 Chorizo burger. Really nice to have a selection of food that you typically would see at restaurants down in the Ohio city / Tremont area. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The Foundry is a great modern restaurant right in the heart of downtown Elyria. The food was great and the servers were friendly. 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"We went here tonight to see what all the buzz was about. Upon arrival we were seated promptly. The place is quite large with bar, booth, and table seating. Our waitress was attentive and brought out our drinks promptly. My friend had a steak; his.girlfriend had a burger, and I had the meatloaf. Other than a slight kick, the meatloaf was nothing to write home about. The brussel sprouts were undercook and quite chewy. My friend remarked that his steak was ok but it wasn't any better than one he had at Applebee's. Our Lady friend said her burger and fries were tasty. 

I'm a bit worried that the menu and it's descriptions are a bit above blue collar Elyria. Maybe more suited for Lakewood or the west suburbs. Time will tell. The pricing seemed reasonable.  I wish them luck. 

I'm willing to give it one more try. Maybe lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere,  great menu, has all the makings to be a huge success!!  staff was friendly and mostly attentive, I only noticed a few of the wait staff that looked like they needed to be doing something.
all was going well until our entrees came, I even has a really well done ceasar salad.
My brother and myself both ordered a burger \" medium\" both burgers came out burnt and charred  on the outside, and well done inside. both  missing the bacon we ordered, my brother waited 5 min or so for his the bacon while his burger grew cold I was dissapointing when I saw the two things strip of just diner quality bacon when it came out.  the sides of lettuce tomato onion on the side came out on the burger this was dissapointing the ingredients  all were fresh and of good quality,  I feel like it would have been a good burger if prepared properly, the sweet potato fries were bland and  desperately needed salt. 
Dad ordered  ordered the spicy noodles, it was just bad, the strong flavor of soy overpowered the rest of the ingredients in the dish.
Mom had a cappitelli noodle and roasted vegetable dish, generous portion of pasta, just a very bland pasta dish , no real flavor to leave an impression. 
Also was surprised how few people were there being dinner time on Valentine's day. not a good sign of things to come.
If this place can get the issues in the Kitchen straight it could be a big hit, something we definitely need in this area.
I hope they can't get it together !!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the ambiance of this place. Service has always been attentive and courteous. Unique menu items for a great value! 

My favorite place to eat within the area."}
{"text":"First off I was drawn to this place because of its name and decor. Its definitely a good choice for a dinner or a long lunch. I've eaten there two times for lunch and one carry out. All three times the food was very good but, the service was off. The two lunches I had a chicken and waffle pizza and a burger and had no complaints about either item. The pizza was possibly the best bar pizza I've eaten. It was everything I expect from chicken and waffles but in pizza form! The biggest problem was inattentive service, we finally asked for our sever and she was out pretty quick. Of course we asked what happened to her and her reply was \"I got lost\".  Oh well it happens but, next visit different server, same problem. 

The carry out was same quality of food so again no complaints there. I thought I could cut out the 20 minutes of waiting for a check by calling in the order. Figured I'd run in at pickup time, toss them the money and make a quick get away. I placed the order 1 hour ahead of time, then arrived \"fashionably late\" (5 min), had cash in hand to do the swap. Well good thing I wasn't double parked (which I'm known for doing), I give them my name and the orders not ready, 20 min later I was able to get out of there. 

In closing everything is good except the 20 min thing, given I'm allowed a 1 hour max lunch and I've lost 20 min on every visit I've had avoid their place. Now I'd be a regular but, I have to explain to my wife I'm not gonna eat her dinner because of their pizza. Given the normal husband always wrong, I'm not sure I'its not worth sleeping in the barn for a night."}
{"text":"We had the deep fried pickles and I had the chicken and waffles. I liked the batter on the pickles and the sauce they come with for dipping. The breading on the chicken was really good too. My girlfriend had a pizza and a salad. The pizza looked good and she said it was really good. Will probably return."}
{"text":"What can I say?  Plain outstanding!  Food is top notch.  Drink and beer selection is perfect.  Such a great atmosphere!  Live an hour away and will come back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for date night. We were not disappointed! We had such an awesome time, and amazing service by Megan. Great food great beer selection, great specials. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and good service.  Clean.  Nice bathrooms.  Simple menu.  Food was good.  Nothing amazing but this place is only a month old.  And it is simply the best place in Elyria to eat.   The options are not great but this place has potential.  Good job.  A few specials that will set them apart would help."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING!!!  We've been here many times.  The food and atmosphere are the best!  It's a bit pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"Really would like to give them more stars, but they just aren't quite there.

The good:   Great beer list, good selection of wines, a full and diverse bar.   Appetizers were great (we had the deep fried pickles, breadsticks, and lobster bisque).   Bisque could have been warmer, but was still good.

The average:   Entrees were ok, just a bit underseasoned.   All the parts of the Cubano were there but it was bland.   The deconstructed lasagna was similar.   

The below average:   Sorry folks, but it was the waitstaff.   Mixups on who was covering the table, long waits for drink orders.   One waitress didn't know what a Sauvignon Blanc was!   My wife took the entire dec. lasagna dish home, no question about if it was ok.   (We plan on seasoning it properly and enjoying it for lunches!)

I hope they work these issues out.   This place could absolutely rock if they do.   Great ambience, I will go back!"}
{"text":"Our overnight stop in Elyria Ohio - we found the Foundry and had great burgers, beer and wine! Good atmosphere, great service - enjoy."}
{"text":"We went to the Foundry for the Sunday brunch today. We were struck by the design and decor of this place as soon as we walked in. That was followed by friendly greetings from the hostess and our server. We got both the regular and brunch menus, providing a great selection of food and beverages. I ordered the \"Tuscan sausage and bean soup\" (delicious!) with a classic Rueben sandwich, and my friend ordered the \"In Bacon We Trust\" burger (50% beef, 50% bacon) and chips. We were both quite happy with our choices! We plan to go back and try a few more interesting-looking items in the near future."}
{"text":"Not bad but a little pricey for a night out. Not that I wouldn't mind paying for it but the food is basic. The staff was polite, the place was clean and if you tend to lean to the hipster lifestyle, this is the place for you. Parking can be challenging when it's busy."}
{"text":"A gem in downtown Elyria and very good fresh food at reasonable prices.  Fun atmosphere with history of Elyria."}
{"text":"Gave a 2 star mainly for the interior design. It's very nice inside, you forget you're in downtown Elyria. Was seated after 1 minute. Took awhile to get to order though it was at its dead time. We ordered 2 pops (Pepsi & rootbeer), pretzel appetizer and a small veggie pizza to split. Pop didn't taste right at all. Pretzels were very greasy and plain. The cheese was plain nothing special. Almost like the cheese you have In your freezer or fridge n heat up. Was clumpy not smooth like you'd expect. Pizza was super greasy and nor great either. Service was slow , waitress was nice. Will not be going back there to eat."}
{"text":"1st time here, had chicken and waffles.  It's legit.  Good spot to fit in rotation.  Crab cakes are real."}
{"text":"Wasn't pleased at all with lunch here. Waited almost 30 minutes for two sandwiches that were sub par. It wasnt even busy."}
{"text":"I am very happy to see a more hip restaurant open in Elyria. Exposed brick, cast-iron decor with glass garage doors that open to the side walk. Ample, ample seating. The atmosphere is warm, friendly and modern.

The food is also a welcome departure from the standard dive fare in Lorain County. Wasabi deviled eggs with panchetta? Deep fried pickles? Garlic aioli? Yes please! I had the black bean burger, and the broccoli greens and caramelized onions sent it over the top. Plus the pricing remains competitive with the downtown restaurants.

I really hope this place can make it. I am concerned this might be a little bit more Lakewood or Westlake than Elyria, but us Elyria folk deserve better. And The Foundry fills that niche nicely."}
{"text":"Went here for about the fifth time recently and had a very nice meal. Some past deficiencies were corrected and gave me a feeling that this place will make it. Specifically not one but two staff members came around to ask how things were. If an owner doesn't care about a patrons experience that establishment is on a downhill slide but maybe this owner is waking up to the concept. Previous food items have been hit or miss. The sausage and bean soup I had on my first visit was as good as any ones but sadly I have not caught it again. The burger on the black and tan bread not so great. The burger itself was good but the toasted bread slices they put it on added nothing and a lack of absorbancy allowed all the juices to run down my face. I might have dealt with that if the uncaring barmaid did her job and brought some napkins. Instead she disappeared for a long stretch and when she did return to the bar promptly engaged in an extended conversation with a coworker.  Finally when she came down my way and I got her attention I got a no word response like I was inconveniencing her.
Never asked me how things were. Must be related to someone . On some visits there has been a guy bar tending and he has been much better and is a natural since he knows how to communicate with people. On this visit Pork was the special for Thursday so I tried it and it was good. Nicely cooked and juicy , good portion at a fair price point ( unlike some other menu items ). Also had the deviled eggs and the friend and I enjoyed them. The carrot cake desert was delish.
 I will be back when I feel like spending a little more for a little more upscale atmosphere than a typical Elyria bar. I do hope they can continue to improve and offer value to their costumers."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here before hiking in the area and weren't too impressed. The interior was nice and modern but the service and food was definitely below par. We were there for Sunday brunch and it wasn't crowded at all. In fact, there were more empty tables than occupied but our food still took entirely too long. I ordered the chicken and waffles and she ordered the cinnamon French toast. Her French toast came out 10 minutes before my meal and was cold anyways. My chicken was rubbery and most likely either undercooked or spoiled. The waitress never came back to check on us and ask us about our food and our glasses remained empty for about 10 minutes. While she was nice, the waitress was not very attentive. Especially considering how empty this place was. A few of the bartenders were actually sitting at the bar with their friends because there were no customers. Needless to say, we will never be back"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate here over the weekend and it was really good. They food was excellent and it was reasonable priced. They have a large selection of whiskeys and bourbon. They have a chicken and waffles pizza which was delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone. It is located in downtown Elyria, they did not have much parking for the size of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The setting, service, cocktails and food were all above average.. it's clear the Foundry is trying to help revive downtown Elyria ... the inside of the restaurant is well designed and comfortable.. quality apps crab cakes and grilled romain salad were a great opener for excellent mac and cheese.we would return if we R in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"I really appreciate the atmosphere here, but all other components are lacking.  I've been here a handful of times & enjoy the menu except they lack the full on dining service I expect.  Kitchen is slow &   Doesn't seem to get orders correct.  Staff is not synchronized.  I get it you are not my server but my empty plates are cluttering my table you've walked by me twice you can simply take one for the team & grab my empty dish.  Acts of kindness reflect your business & your money.  I had to enjoy the dirty table landscape.  I'm paying for an experience please execute it properly.  

Maybe it's demographics but regardless no excuse management can train these simple techniques to make a memorable dining experience.  Take my criticism kindly I'm just trying to help, would love to have a regular place to enjoy.  

On a positive note the do offer daily specials.  & staff is friendly (just not polished)"}
{"text":"Really awesome place in downtown Elyria right next to McDonald's. It's great to see a spot like this with great food and a solid beer selection. I've had 3 meals here. Pizza, buffalo chicken wrap, and wings. All were delicious. If I had to make any nit pick, the wings were a little oily when they came out. A smudge mushy still if that makes sense. But it didn't bother me enough not to eat them again. Cool rustic sort of look with the vibe to match. I saw about 15ish beer taps and plenty of spirits at the bar. I'm sure you'll enjoy this place. Even a little room that has a big table and chairs for a private event. Great for dinner and drinks with friends or family."}
{"text":"Has nice curb appeal, and ambiance inside is very nice. Elyria really needs a \"step-up restaurant\" like this!  I'm hoping it survives the local economy and sticks around awhile.

My husband and I visited on a Friday afternoon for a bowl of Lobster Bisque ... it was amazing!  We also tried some Jingle Juice (Cranberry Vodka, Apple Cider, Ginger Beer, Splash of Cranberry) and Crabbies Spiced Orange Ginger Beer - both - also amazing!  The people sitting next to us ordered the meatloaf sandwich (sorry - not sure what its actually called) - but it was HUGE and they raved about it the entire time we were there.  Perhaps next time we visit, we'll try it!  

We visited again this weekend and tried the meatloaf sliders, grilled cheese, and the Elyria...all delicious!"}
{"text":"Yelp'ed this off the beaten path pub.  Sports bar and loud  sports for sure but a smaller quieter section and the good was AWESOME!  So if you need to catch up on some of your teams , even better."}
{"text":"A bit of backstory - I am from the Columbus area, and my husband is from Elyria. Based on what I've heard and seen, Elyria has been on a slow downward trend over the last 40 years, like many other smaller Ohio cities. I always equate Elyria to the Dayton/Springfield area in my mind, since that's where my extended family lives and the downtown areas have followed a similar trajectory. Anyway - I am hopeful that this restaurant is a sign of a downtown Elyria renaissance! If this restaurant were in Columbus, say in Clintonville or something, it would be super popular (and more expensive). It's got hip decor, a great bar/draft selection, and a menu that walks the line between inventive and traditional. I have been here several times since they opened and have not had a single dish that I wouldn't be happy to recommend! The service is always friendly, the prices are fair, and they have special 'tap takeover' drafts with special $3.50 a pint prices. Also, one of those cool sets of garage doors that roll up so you can enjoy an indoor 'patio' on nice nights! 

I was just here this past weekend and had the vegan fajitas. You would NEVER miss the meat/cheese because they were so flavorful that I wanted to eat them forever! The salsa that came with it was just the right amount of heat, and the corn tortillas were nicely roasted. The southwest salad here is huge, and if you add chicken you'll have to take half of your dish home. There is also a salmon entree, an asian pork salad, steaks filet, pizza, and burgers. Lots of variety so that everyone can find a dish they'll enjoy. 

If you are in the area, stop here for lunch or dinner, or just grab a beer!"}
{"text":"I don't think I can give this place five stars without eating more than just fried pickles, but my first visit made a fan and I'd love to upgrade this review once I get to return. The city of Elyria really needs the Foundry, a gastropub with a great beer selection, refined decor, pleasant atmosphere, and really friendly staff. Really excited to have this place in Elyria and look forward to stopping over after a softball game this summer. 
The Foundry has a large dining area and a decent patio that looks out on Broad St. It'll be great this summer. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"I want to love it, the decor and concept are great, I love that the menu sounds healthier than the usual greasy fried bar food fare, but I've tried 3 times, 3 different menu items and the result is the same, the food and flavors just aren't there to win me back."}
{"text":"love this place! Staff is amazing & there menu is so diverse! & they have the best craft beers"}
{"text":"Yum!!! Great food, great drinks! My husband and I have been here twice so far and will keep going back! The poutine appetizer is so delicious! By no means was the food healthy. But it was tasty! We got big fat burgers the first time and they hit the spot for a great burger! The server was super helpful with deciding on a beer!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place with lots of character.  Kelly was our waitress and she was great!  Wonderful food recommendations and energetic personality.  I had the strip steak with Brussels sprouts and mac and cheese and my husband had the short rib dinner.  Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"Just the kind of place Elyria needs. The place looks great, the food was very good, and the service was excellent. I had the salmon it was excellent, maybe too spicy for some but perfect for me. My girlfriend had the bacon burger and loved it, home made chips were excellent too. Appetizer pretzels had a great beer cheese sauce. Mac and cheese was nothing to write home about but my overall experience was very positive. I hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"Ok, so I was in town for 3 days for training. I ate lunch here everyday. The first day was great- I had meatloaf and pototoes with shredded Brussel sprouts. Amazing. Service was great too. Second day I had a personal Pizza and fried pickles, again- service and food great. The third day was awful. We went in, ordered with an hr lunch break, 10 mins left in our break and still no food. The waitress had forgotten to put our order in. Our meal was free and they boxed it to go. However, the food I got made me horribly sick a few hrs later. House salad with ranch and the chicken bacon pasta. I don't know what caused the flip in both food and service, but I am very disappointed. Thought I had found an awesome new spot."}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriend's birthday on a Thursday night. We ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer....best fried pickles I've ever had....and they are my favorite so I've had them everywhere!! We both ordered drinks which were good, and I ordered a half wedge salad which was so big we split it. It was literally a half of a head of iceburg!! It was soooooo good. By the time our dinner came I was full. I ordered salmon and my boyfriend ordered a burger, both were amazing, plus we had leftovers for the next day! It's a great atmosphere too; industrial and unique. My only complaint is service was a little slow, and we had somewhere we had to be and were a little late, but the food overshadowed that part! We will definitely be returning and have already made dinner plans with friends there this weekend!"}
{"text":"The food here is top notch. We have been here 3 more times and everything we order is great. However, the wait staff has yet to bring us an order without either forgetting something or bringing us the wrong item on any of our . It wasn't even busy this last time and my wife's order came back wrong and the server said she put it in wrong. She offered to have the kitchen make it up right but we didn't want to wait. We saw the manager once when we walked in but he never came by to check on us or anyone else eating. If this place wants to survive long term and compete with places like Wolfeys then the manager and staff will have to step it up."}
{"text":"Great food - fresh, local, unique. In Bacon We Trust burger satisfied the meat eater, while vegetarians were pleased with margarita pizza, caprese salad, and portobello burger. Great and large selection of tap beers, including many local. Great room - large but still warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Been here twice. I have nothing bad to say. Good prices, timely service and good kids menu. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Visited on 3/11/18.  Even being short staffed the service was amazing!!  The food was phenomenal! Portions were great for big eaters. The craft brew and beer lists are absolutely the best!  If you like trying new beers, you've got to check out this place. It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on our drive back to the east coast. It was Easter Sunday, so when I called, they said that we had to make reservations. When we got there, turned out to be unlimited brunch menu only. It was $23 including a mimosa or bloody mary. 

The food was okay. The chicken was good, the pasta was a bit bland. Breakfast meats were standard. Breakfast potatoes were super dry and boxy. Carved ham was a little dry but the edges were sweet and crispy. I liked the potato pierogis but the edges were a little dried out. The salad/fruit/cheese bar was pretty extensive. There were also an assortment of breads, butters and mustard. 

Service was quick and they were nice. My biggest complaint was the automatic 20% gratuity. Not sure if that's something that's always done, strange because there were only 2 of us and we basically served ourselves...with an upcharge for Titos and a coffee,  the bill ended up being $60... pricy."}
{"text":"My daughter had the bacon mac and cheese and it was terrible. Very dry and no flavor. The manager came up to her and said you didn't like it ?  She said \"no\" and he replied well maybe next time try something different.  Only two bites out of the mac and cheese no comp for the nasty food and I doubt if there will be a next time.  Food is very bland and our server very slow."}
{"text":"The food was amazing- I had the Foundry Pickles and Bacon Mac. The pickle spears were crispy and the breading was crisp. The Bacon mac had great flavor, tons of delicious cheese, and was served in a cast iron skillet. My husband had the Big Bird sandwich and Pretzels, chicken was cooked well and the pretzels were hot and delicious. The atmosphere here is really amazing, you can tell a lot of work went into some of the art pieces hanging from the center of the room. The only negative was our waitress, she barely checked on us, didn't remove old dishes until the end of the meal, and let us run completely out of drinks- never came by for refills. The entire time we were in the restaurant, she spent leaning against the bar and talking to the other staff members. The place was busy and only a few of the wait staff were actually busting butt to take care of customers. If you go here, don't have Megan serve you. Otherwise AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Foundry Kitchen and Bar is a gem! It's so refreshing to have it here in Elyria where chain restaurants reign. The food and service were both excellent. I've been a couple times and really plan to include Foundry in my local favorites. I love the rustic and gears decor. It really gives the place a cool and laid back atmosphere. It's bigger than expected and I noticed a private room as well. I will definitely consider having parties here in the future.
They have great Happy Hour specials on most drinks, with Happy Hour extending until 7:00pm, which is nice for me because I work until 5:00pm most days and work about 35 minutes from my home in Elyria. The pizza is excellent with ample toppings. The wings were perfect and crispy. I had the FKB Nachos in the past, with tequila steak, and they were awesome! The prices are affordable, especially for the quality of the food you get. The beer list is extensive and includes many local brews.
I see Foundry Kitchen & Bar being a favorite spot of ours for years to come, thanks for opening in Elyria! :)"}
{"text":"Hidden GEM in Elyria! The food here is AMAZING!! Deviled eggs were insanely good! BLT salad is my favorite! My husband got the blackened chicken and he is grill master and critic of all meats!! He said it was the best chicken he has ever had! So juicy!! You must check this place out! Request KELLY if you can!! Best server ever!! She is the sweetest!"}
