{"text":"The best. This is a hidden gem in the most unlikely location. The chicken and ribs are fantastic, salads are fresh and tasty, and the wings are excellent. The chickenland sandwich, however, is the star of the show! You must try it."}
{"text":"Too bad I can't give bonus stars for this rating. The customer service is literally Amazing. Impossible to find any better service than these guys. Their food is even better. The family meal with two chickens, hands down feeds my hungry family for more than a day. The prices are unbelievable. They are \"in\" a gas station which makes it even that more alluring. They deliver. For a tiny fee. So worth it. The wing deal on Wednesdays and Thursdays are now what I look forward to."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Glad sometimes good food, service and pricing don't change much."}
{"text":"The location is not as convenient as where they were before but its still great chicken.  It reminds you of Swiss Chalet or St Huberts.  Its good stuff if you live in the area and get delivery but since its just a small takeout location and has limited parking its a bit of a crap shoot if you can park in that small lot.  The main thing is the food is good.  Last time i was there i had a 1/4 chicken dinner which was perfectly cooked  and the person who was with me got their wings deal which sure smelled good even though i didnt have a chance due to the overwhelming greed and gluttony of my friend :)"}
{"text":"Good food but little over the top with tobacco sauce. Over all not bad really good customer service and friendly"}
{"text":"Attended this premise based on the reviews. I was not disappointed! Chicken is awesome and portion sizes are large. I had the double leg and also ordered their chicken nuggets, my kids loved the nuggets, as well. I have been back again and tried their wings. The wing are so good and a normal size, not like an oversized wing with fat. These wing are friers, lean and tasty. My sauces are medium and honey garlic (two pounds each). The owner/operator and his family take great pride and treat us really nice. Never using Swiss Chalet again, this place has won me over. You will not be disappointed! The reviews are on point."}
{"text":"My favourite hidden chicken spot. Love the fries and chicken. Great value and always fresh!"}
