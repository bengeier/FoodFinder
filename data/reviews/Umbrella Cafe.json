{"text":"Happy we found this place! It was exactly what were were looking for. The staff was super friendly and the hot spinach & feta omelet was very good. We will def go back if we are in the city for breakfast again!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Linzee (the Soup Nancy) makes the best soup and sandwiches in town. This is my go-to breakfast and lunch spot for a fast and fresh meal."}
{"text":"Everything I get from here is delicious! Very friendly staff and wonderful, wholesome food. Can't say enough great things about this new cafe."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful and fills a void in an area where delicious, fresh, and fast food is not easily found. Their selection of sandwiches and daily soups were excellent and really reasonably priced. Their baked goods were delicious, as were the available juices. I would be excited to see how the menu evolves as the cafe becomes more established!

Perhaps the greatest asset to this cafe is the atmosphere created by the owners. They are friendly and very generous with advice and samples. Everyone working is invested in their food (both emotionally and financially) and had me wanting to come back again and again (which I did...)"}
{"text":"Wow! Staying at the Westin down the street and stumbled in. This place is fantastic!  I had the Cap and Porky sandwich and it was, perhaps, the best sandwich I've ever had! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh food; decent prices; super friendly, helpful staff.  Perfect for a quick, reasonable bite while I did some computer work. Good veggie/vegan options!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in this place and definitely my last. I heard about The Umbrella Cafe because I saw that they sold Gluten Free Goat bake goods and wanted to try them. Now I really wish Gluten Free Goat associated themselves with a different restaurant downtown. A coworker and I walked in and placed our orders. I asked the waitress questions about the food. Telling her right away I couldn't have gluten or dairy, in which she must have thought I was telling her this for funnsies. When I ordered the omelette and modified my order I specifically said no feta because I'm lactose intolerant and can't have dairy. This cashier/waitress seemed like a fairly competent person, so I figured she would note this for the cook. Wrong! Instead when he brought it out I double checked to see if no dairy was used. He cooked it in butter... when I told him I can't have butter he then started to scold me for not saying anything (my coworker said he yelled). He then goes angrily back complaining about remaking my food. The cashier didn't even tell him it was her fault. My coworker even said \"you told her you couldn't have dairy\".  As we waited regulars came in and were given their food immediately while our whole wait was over 30 minutes. After spending $16 for horrible service I recommend if you have any diet restrictions don't go to there. They are careless with instructions."}
{"text":"Quaint & original. Absolutely delicious, fresh food full of flavor. The Pinky Splint cookie is a must have for dessert! It's an Earl Grey tea cookie with lemon & orange zest and vanilla buttercream in the center...coated with lavender sugar."}
{"text":"I heard about this place on Kickstarter and after taking a look at their facebook page, I saw a picture of their short ribs + mac and cheese and knew I needed to have it. Immediately. So I patiently waited until the next Wednesday and walked across downtown to try it. I was not disappointed and went back to the office demanding everyone go try this place. Also - the lil nebby oatmeal cream pie is a must-have.

Aside from the food, this place has a great atmosphere. Special shout out to the Pun of the Day board. Everyone who worked there was really nice and the menu had healthy, vegan-friendly options that went beyond salad. All in all, I think this is a welcome addition to the downtown lunch scene."}
{"text":"The place is cool and hip looking. I got the lunch box special based on another person's yelp review. It was $12 for a half a sandwich, small soup, and a drink. I got the grilled cheese, soup of the day and a coffee. The sandwich was a standard sliced bread with grilled cheese, nothing fancy. I don't remember the soup I got, but there were no complaints. The coffee was pretty standard. The food wasn't bad,  but I think its overpriced."}
{"text":"There is not much more I can add that other customers have not already said.  The tabouleh salad is fresh and out of this world!  I also enjoy the grilled cheese sandwich and plan to try a different variation the next time I go.  The establishment would only be better if they moved the counter back toward the kitchen another 4 feet and added a few more tables... if that is even possible, who knows?  Thank you for a fantastic dining alternative within walking distance of the \"banking district\" !

2017- Noooo they've gone out of business !!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a while but it's hard for me get to it when they're only open on weekdays during my work hours. Their hours are Mon-Fri, 7am-4pm. I had read that they are a combination of businesses from the Public Market that joined forces: Soup Nancy's, Savasana Juice Company and Om Nom Bake Studio. I finally got to try it for lunch today and I'm so happy I did. 

In good Yelper fashion, I opted for the Lunch Box Special so I could try a bit of everything and report my findings of each menu category to you. The Lunch Box Special comes with soup, 1/2 sandwich, a roll, a cookie and a drink. For $2 more, you can get a fresh juice. Their soups change daily but I got a vegan vegetable chowder. I couldn't even tell it was vegan because it was perfectly creamy as a chowder should be. For my sandwich, I ordered the Fig Prosciutto Grilled Cheese. I usually don't like goat cheese but the salty prosciutto and sweet fig spread complement the creaminess of the goat cheese so well in this sandwich. I can't remember exactly the name of the cookie that came in my lunch box, but it was a sandwich of two ginger cookies of some sort with a sweet buttercream filling. At first, the ginger was a bit strong but the buttercream gave it a smooth finish. Rather unique, but still very tasty. Lastly, the juice. I picked out the Kalypso Kooler and wow was it amazing. It was tart, yet sweet and totally refreshing! It's a great green juice (derived from kale, apple, lemon and ginger) to try if you've never had green juice before. What a great meal. 

The service was great. The gentleman waiting on me was extremely helpful in describing the menu and providing recommendations since it was my first time there. And the food came out quickly. 

The Umbrella Cafe also serves breakfast all day, which I'm really excited to try another time. In addition, they have changing daily specials. I really love seeing a place that serves up food made from scratch using ingredients that are locally sourced. This will be one of my go-to lunch spots for sure!"}
{"text":"I want to add to my review that I just had the short ribs and mac & cheese, their Wednesday special, and it was AMAZING. You have to get this. But make sure you go before noon, it sells out fast. I wanted to take a picture. But it was so good I forgot."}
{"text":"Breakfast of oatmeal with cinnamon and dried cranberries and a breakfast sandwich. Great food for a really great price. Place that feels like it's filling a certain niche without being pretentious. Restaurant and staff looked really clean too. I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"First off, the music here was all great, they create a perfect ambiance. 

The food was also delicious, I got a spinach, tomato and feta cheese omelette and I would highly recommend it. The ingredients all tasted fresh and the omelette was professionally made.

Even if you don't have time for breakfast, they had these buttercream filled fig bars that were delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. The staff creates a very friendly and entertaining atmosphere. The food was great and the lil' nebby oatmeal cookie was mind blowing."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for lunch downtown. I will definitely return. Trendy atmosphere and interesting food combinations. I got the Fig, Prosciutto, and Goat Cheese sandwich and it was delicious. The lunch rush was not bad - not a long wait time."}
{"text":"Great little cafe. If your looking for a quick healthier option this is your place! I had the pesto chicken salad on multi grain bread and it was so good! Also the juices they have are delicious!"}
{"text":"1st time here and it's legit!  Got the Wednesday special. SHORT RIBS AND MAC N CHEESE.  so good. Small place but good food. We need more like this downtown."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch one day on a whim and wasn't disappointed. I got the lunch box, with the white bean chili and half of a chicken pesto sandwich. It also comes with a cookie, I got the oatmeal cookie sandwich with cream in the middle and it was excellent. They have juice by Savasana Juice Company, every juice I have tried so far is amazing. Beetlejuice is my favorite with Kaleypso Kooler being a close second. The customer service is really good as well, the staff is very friendly! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I took my coworkers there. While they were a little nervous about going to a \"hippie vegan place\", they agreed to take a walk with me and try it out. I recently became vegan, and places that serve vegan food excite me to an extend I can't explain. Their vegan options were amazing and I absolutely loved my food! My coworkers had various meat filled sandwiches and all said they loved it. A breath of fresh air in downtown Pittsburgh's lunch scene!"}
{"text":"Since working downtown, I am always on the lookout for good lunch spots that won't break the bank, are deliciously healthy and don't take a lot of time. Well this is it! Service was FANTASTIC and my meal was completely scrumptious! I read another review on here that the person went back to their office and demanded everyone to try it.......I'm guilty of doing the same! I ordered the lunchbox special....for my soup: Pumpkin and Black Bean 1/2 sammie:Capicollo and Porketta drink:Melon Moonshine and a Lil Nebby for dessert........$12!!!! I've spent that at other restaurants dahntahn and received crappy service, a sucky meal and total disgust for society.....THANK YOU Umbrella Cafe for redeeming my feelings on the lunchtime food scene! I'll be back again today!"}
{"text":"I got the three egg omelette breakfast and asked to substitute cheddar instead of feta.
The veggies were raw and not grilled properly. It was just added cold on top of omelette. The cheddar cheese slices was also cold and didn't melt.
It was weired eating my omelette like that."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast and daily specials. Would definitely come back again. One little gripe is that they asked for a tip at check out when no table service are provided, we had to put away the plates and dispose the trash ourselves."}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing their service, coffee selection, and vegan baked goods since I recently stopped in for a treat on the go, but it was a great experience and I'll be back for a meal soon. I walked in and noticed the man behind the counter was chatting with one of his regulars who had hadn't seen in a while. It's always a good sign when the staff and owners take the time to notice things like that. The ambience was airy and pleasant, with plenty of cute little seating areas. The coffee smelled great as well, and there was little fridge with some super high-end looking cold brew that I was dying to try. When it was my turn I ordered one apple cider donut and an almond butter brownie from the Gluten Free Goat items they had on display. I ended up with an extra donut for free, courtesy of the kind man behind the counter, which was the nicest surprise! In light of that and due to everything about the Umbrella Cafe being so appealing, I know I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Is it bad that I wanted to lick the aluminum foil that my short ribs and mac n cheese was served on?? Seriously  delicious!!"}
{"text":"The lunch box is quite possibly the best deal in downtown Pittsburgh!  For 12 bucks, you get half a sandwich - any sandwich from their delicious line-up, a small soup - which is not so small, a drink - $2 up charge for one of their delicious looking fresh juices and a cookie.  What's not to love?

Both my friend and I picked the lunch box for lunch.  I got the fig, prosciutto and goat cheese sandwich - just awesome.  Great combination of flavors.  My soup was the chicken lemon - maybe a wee bit too lemon-y, but still very tasty.  My cookie was a vegan ginger which may have possibly been the best ginger cookie I have ever had - soft, but not crumbly, sugar coated and just ginger-y enough without being bitter.  I also had an Honest Tea - my favorite of all bottled teas.  My friend had the chicken pesto which she said was awesome and not overpoweringly pesto-ish, the cheesy spicy zucchini which was slightly too spicy for her tastes and an oatmeal sandwich cookie that she described as \"the best icing ever.\""}
{"text":"Wow! Really happy with this place! My wife asked that we go here on a lunch date to try the short rib/Mac n cheese dish. The short rib was good, but the Mac was great. And the winner of the day was the \"little nebby\" oatmeal cookies. Holy $hit, so good; they must use a lot of butter in these cookies bc they are amazing with the fluffiest, lightest cream filling. 

My understanding is that this is actually 3 businesses combined: Soup Nancy's, Om Nom Bakery, and Savasana Juice Company"}
{"text":"I went because I wanted to try something different for lunch. The reviews were all so good too. I got the prosciutto fig walnut sandwich with cold beet soup and vegan cookie and bottled juice. The sandwich was petite and despite what other reviewers said, I didn't love it. It wasnt terrible and was definitely edible. However, I could barely find the prosciutto and honestly questioned whether it had any at points. The cold beat soup was edible but was basically bland beet juice with very bland chunks of beet I think. There were couple things in the soup that I could could not identify, hopefully part of a beet plant. The vegan chocolate chip cookie was not exciting. I really wanted the oatmeal cookie that others raved about but their Baker left them and now they get cookies from some other place. The Calypso cooler juice was good but wrongfully thought the place juiced on the spot. 
I spent $17 with the almost required tip. If I ever go again, I will not get the \"meal deal\" since it's 22% more with tip and tax. $17 for lunch is ridiculous. I can find other places with similar portion and quality minus juice for practically half. Support local and try it tho, you might like it."}
{"text":"Such a cool place!! $5 for make your own grilled cheese is awesome! The staff is super friendly. They have great healthy options, and the juices are totally natural without even water added! Really impressed. They even support local artists by having thier work up on the walls Incase one catches your eye! Cool veggie/vegan options to."}
{"text":"Great looking menu and friendly staff but a few qualities leave something to be desired. I came for lunch and unfortunately they were out of my first choice on the menu, one of the few vegetarian options. So I settled for a hummus and spinach sandwich. There was no warning that there would be an entire jalapeno on my sandwich - after i discovered the offenders, i picked out as many whole pieces as possible but the sandwich was still incredibly spicy. I couldn't tell if the jalapeno was also in the hummus too or if it was just remnants. There DEFINTIELY was a ton of garlic in that hummus. Awkward convention garlic breath not welcome!
But given those undesirable qualities, everything else about the sandwich was great. Fresh veggies and delicious bread! I do wish there was more presentation quality - the sandwich was just flopped on a plate with no garnish or anything to please the eye.
So all in all, I'd try it again, but its not the overall cute café experience I was expecting. And ask about jalapenos in the hummus :)"}
{"text":"You walk in this place and there's healthy food everywhere. Everyone is so nice. There's many things to choose from. Even juices that they make their fresh. The atmosphere is quiet and you can enjoy some time away from the city. I highly recommend that if you like or don't like healthy food that you try this out."}
{"text":"Although it was bit slow to get our carry out breakfast, the food was great and the coffee superb!!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough amazing things about this place!!! Delish, local, quick, inexpensive for breakfast and lunch. The employees are lots of fun too-can get busy during the lunch rush so get there before noon if you can. I've sampled some of the soups, sandwiches and specials from the menu and everything has been fab. All the desserts are just right-go for the lil nebby! Do yourself a favor and make this a regular stop for awesome food...I only wish they were open on weekends so I can share the experience with my hubby!"}
{"text":"Could cry tears of joy that this treasure is so close to my office!! The pesto chicken salad had been my favorite, but today got the \"lunchbox\" option (1/2 sandwich, 1/2 soup, drink snd cookie for $12!!), and the creamy cucumber dill soup (cold) is seriously the best soup I've ever had. I also got a half of the prosciutto, fig and goat cheese grilled cheese, and it is wonderful as well. Can't wait to have the Little Nebby oatmeal cream cookie for dessert! This place is consistently both fast and delicious, staff is fun and friendly - two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for studying! Friendly staff! Delicious fresh juice. Good music."}
{"text":"Two days ago, when it was snowing non-stop, I wanted comfort food.  I walked past this place one night a few weeks ago and was curious what they served.  After finally tracking them down on Yelp, I figured it was the perfect time to test out the Build Your Own Grilled Cheese ($5).

I walked in, and the place was fairly quiet at lunch time.  However, the roads and sidewalks were also treacherous so who knows if that is normal.  Anyway, you can get whatever you want packed in the grilled cheese for only $5, and it's $1 more if you want meat.  I decided to go with Pepper Jack, Mozzarella, Tomato, and Basil on Italian bread.  The grilled cheese is served panini style.  While it was good, it was a bit too bland.  I would love some spicy options for on the grilled cheese.  Hot sauce, buffalo chicken, etc., just something with a bit more of a kick.

The cookies ($1.75) looked really good.

There are some great health-conscious options on the menu, as well as vegan options.  That is pretty awesome.  The employees were friendly, and they take credit cards!  Overall, a cool place for lunch downtown!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places downtown! The staff here is always incredibly friendly and sociable which instantly makes the whole experience so much better.

I have only been here for lunch, but I've heard from others that they serve some great breakfast as well! This store front is a partnership between three different local business-  Savasana Juice Company, Soup Nancys and Om Nom Bake Studio. The Pesto Chicken Salad Sandwich is great as a lighter lunch option while the Shortrib Mac & Cheese (special on Wednesdays) is for a day you are really wanting to treat yourself to a hearty lunch. The baked good are SOOOOOOO GOOD. One of my favorite is the \"Little Nebby\" which is a homemade spin on the Little Debbie Oatmeal pies. So rich and delicious! This place has great vegan options as well--baked goods included!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, they forgot to give me the cookie that I ordered with my meal and I didn't notice until I was back at my office and unable to go back to get it. Their food is delicious, but pretty small portions...I could have used that cookie I paid for! Everything that I did get was delicious. I was just needing a little bit more food, which is probably why my meal came with the cookie that I didn't get."}
{"text":"Amazing bowl of delicious oatmeal and fresh juice. I sat at the table and did some work after I ate and the atmosphere was so nice. I enjoyed my healthy meal and this cafe very much!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, fresh and delicious. I rarely eat vegan but the food here makes it easy to. Friendly and great vibe. The specials and soups are fantastic. Definitely happy I walked in on a whim."}
{"text":"Umbrella Cafe is a little nondescript joint on Liberty Ave that you have to kind of be looking for to find.  So glad I did tho (thanks Yelp)!  Tried this out for the first time today with some friends at lunch.

I had the Wednesday special (short ribs and Mac n cheese) and it was AWESOME!  I had no intention of having such a heavy lunch, but the wise cashier pointed out that I'd only be able to get it on Weds, so... (someone look up FOMO please).  

Kudos to the UC chef for putting \"love\" into that recipe.  Doesn't look like much (the green twisted pasta under the short ribs, oozing with white cheese looks completely disgusting), but the pasta was perfectly al dente, the short ribs had that \"slow-cooked all day\" complexity and the whole thing was crazy good.  #omnomnom

My friends all raved their dishes too (the grilled cheese sandwich w/ prosciutto and fig and the salad with the feta and tomatoes and the poblano soup).

The one minor oddity is that, for eat-in orders, you pay the tip up front, at the counter.  Well, I didn't actually receive any service, so...  Not a great plan.  (FYI, service was fine, in retrospect.)

BOTTOM LINE:  We'll definitely be back.  Wouldn't have found it without Yelp tho."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is super friendly. And the food is fresh great ingredients and they really have something great going on here. It's a little bit hidden but keep your eyes open and do not miss it. Lentil salad is great ."}
{"text":"Great lunch place food is fabulous...loved the Morrocan soup.
Staff is great and the atmosphere is inviting."}
{"text":"Umbrella Cafe is an extraordinary addition to the downtown lunch scene. As their website states, the goal of the cafe is to serve \"foodies that appreciate quality, care and love,\" and boy, do they hit the mark!

Their \"lunch box\" special is an insanely delicious deal. For $12, you get a small soup, 1/2 sandwich, drink, and cookie. I've tried all their sandwiches and the Capicollo & Porketta (they affectionately refer to it as the Cappy) is literally one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had. A generous portion of meat with pesto and raspberry habanero relish... yum!

I coordinate a non-profit program that is mostly staffed by volunteers, and I recently ordered lunch from Umbrella for all of them. It was easy for everyone to select something from the menu that met their dietary needs, which is wonderful and rare!"}
{"text":"YAY FOR UMBRELLA CAFE! This is just what downtown has needed! 
First I want to say that I know each of the owners of the 3 businesses inside, BUT this review is unbias!

Each of the businesses bring something different to Umbrella on top of all the daily menu specials that they have. This place is incredible. 

So many different choices and so much fresh great food. There's always a vegan and vegetarian option as well. So far I've had the capicollo and Porketta sandwich, basically all of the cookies, grilled cheese, and multiple of the daily soups. 

Their daily specials do run out to make sure to get there early!!!!!! And I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Only the cutest new place to open its doors downtown!

Downtown, especially Liberty Ave, has been craving a little joint like this. It has an incredibly welcoming vibe that encourages you to pull up a seat and have some breakfast or lunch together.

The open plan behind the counter and the hanging lights make you feel as if you're hanging out in your friends kitchen for an afternoon, especially with the friendly staff.

Above the doorway to the kitchen it states \"this is where the magic happens\" and they are not kidding. I'm not usually a fan of Mac n cheese but their short ribs and Mac n cheese special on Wednesday is quickly becoming a favorite. I love that they have daily specials and adorably named cookies (I.e. The lil nebby). Their grilled cheese is also delicious, and it's create your own. With the flexibility of some dishes, you feel as if you're customizing your own meal event though it's just simple, good food.

Whether you're eating in or taking out, you're getting a great meal and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place had so much potential but paying over 6 dollars for a bacon and egg sandwich with the bacon obviously not there and egg fried to a crisp ala McDonald's egg patty special was not worth it. I would have otherwise been happy with this place if not for that. Not coming back for a long time."}
{"text":"Delicious chana masala soup of the day with a yummy half a hummus sandwich and a snickerdoodle cookie. all vegan and all so good and filling :) Very nice service as well!"}
{"text":"I used to work about a block from here and it was my favorite place to eat. The service is great and the food is great! Their breakfast sandwiches are top notch. Everything is MTO, so it's not a place you're in and out of in a few minutes but it's always been worth the wait to me!"}
{"text":"I wandered in here while waiting at the DMV downtown, and what a wonderful surprise! 

As usual, I was pretty indecisive about what I wanted but they were kind enough to offer me samples of all the soup. Maybe this is why I am completely won over, the service was so intimate and comforting just like their soup. 

Also, their soup menu changes so you can always find something new here! I ordered the cream of spinach and artichoke and the Chinese vegetable. Their Chinese vegetable was similar to what my mom makes (but my mom never puts sugar in anything...) 

This place is perfect for Pittsburgh weather, I can't think of a better place to hide out!"}
{"text":"Loved the service, the options and the pesto chicken was excellent.  Glad I discovered this place."}
{"text":"If you're seeking a no frills, non trendy spot to pickup a quick breakfast or lunch that serves flavorful food Umbrella is a great option in downtown Pittsburgh. I've only been to Umbrella for breakfast once and lunch during a business trip as I sought out a non chain, non bar food atmosphere. 

Their breakfast sandwiches are standard but good and I really enjoyed their oxtail dish served sometimes during lunch. The oxtail is mentioned by many Yelpers and it is a must try. 

Umbrella will definitely be a \"go to\" the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I went here for all of my lunch breaks when I worked in the city. The food is very good and as fresh as it gets. The owners are extremely nice. The food is made with care and integrity and it no doubt shines through when you take your first bite. Ignore the usual unhealthy sub and pizza shops and go straight for this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"The sign out on the sidewalk advertising the daily special sucked me into the Umbrella Café today. It read, in bold artsy print, \"Shorty Mac\" and below \"Boneless Beef Short Ribs over Mac-N-Cheese $9.00\". Ummm, how could I resist?

Inside I found a quaint little café with five tables and seating at a counter along the wall. I ordered the special and within five minutes I was handed my meal on a real plate and silverware (not some paper or styrofoam plate and plastic flatware). The beef ribs were tender as could be and the mixture of beef gravy and cheese made me wish that they served bread with the meal so I could soak up the mixture after I was done with the beef and mac. An absolutely fantastic meal!!! Got to wonder how their other specials are but for now, the Umbrella gets a solid 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"The staff at this cafe plus the vegan food options are what will bring me back to Umbrella next time I'm in Pittsburgh. 
All of the crew were vibrant in a welcoming (not overbearing) way. The Jamaican Spinach soup was fantastic for a late lunch. So glad this was my first stop in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this charming breakfast/lunch cafe. The food is fresh, delicious and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Cold coffee with almond milk is amazing! Love how it doesn't have any added sugar. 

I also got the egg breakfasts sandwich with as many cheeses as you like. It was okay.... Small portion sizes. Nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, reasonably priced, and friendly service.  A little disorganized this morning as it was their first day open after a week closed for vacation, but it's obvious that when they are working at full capacity that this is a gem."}
{"text":"Consistently pleased with their food, great people running the place. It's a magical place."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh & so glad I found this gem through Yelp! I had a delicious grilled cheese sandwich & iced coffee! Super nice staff who helped me figure out how many cheese to have & Suggesting I add delicious pepper jelly! Thanks Yelpers for helping me find this place & definitely visit if you haven't!"}
{"text":"Awesome little cafe with quick cheap eats. They have specials like their white bean chile that make the windy pittsburgh streets a little more bearable once you've had a bellyful. The coffee is a little gritty but it gets the job done. Their grilled cheese gives you the option to pick cheeses, toppings, and either bacon or capicola for just $1 extra. If I worked downtown I could see myself grabbing lunch here pretty often."}
{"text":"I liked it here so much. When I'd get off the bus I would pop in every morning on my way to the office for a shot. A shot of juice that is. A really refreshing watermelon mix that would jumpstart my day. Brekkie sandwiches made to order, so good. Fresh and local Ingredients."}
{"text":"It's so awesome to have a cafe like this downtown. I've been looking for a local spot where I can grab a tea (yes they have tea, more on that later), maybe lunch and conduct meetings.

The environment is relaxed and perfect for all three of those options! I was very happy to see they offered looseleaf tea from local Tupelo Tea (yay for Earl Grey!). And even better, they have a carafe of almond milk for you to add to your cup. What?! That's unheard of and amazing! Normally I have to ask the barista's and I always feel bad just asking for a touch of it.

I also stuck around for lunch and tried Soup Nancy's roasted red pepper soup. They also included a roll, and I opted for the gluten free. Totally did not expect that a gluten free roll could taste so good! And the soup was excellent and surprisingly had a little kick, which I dug! 

I love the concept too. These were three awesome businesses formerly at the now closed Pittsburgh Public Market who came together to open this great business. So not only can you get delicious soup from Soup Nancy's, you can also grab tasty treats from Om Nom Bakery and healthy juices from Savasana Juice Company. 

So much variety, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Good for breakfast. I had the egg and cheese sandwich with pesto. They let you pick the toppings you want on it. It was tasty. Service is slow, though. And they didn't have smoothie ingredients that day."}
{"text":"We walked in the door, embraced by a pack of owners who love what they do. I have always believed when someone cooks with love, you can actually taste it. The four owners have pooled together all of their skills to create an establishment that puts the type of love and attention into food that you can't find just anywhere. Do your stomach a favor, quit filling it with processed junk, and go spend some time at umbrella with quality people making quality nosh."}
