{"text":"Formerly OH MY DOG, looks like HSB put some money into renovations. The space looks alot better then when it was OMD. We were the only ones eating here on a Saturday for lunch.....WHAT ???       Service was very good, as it should be if your the only ones there lol. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it had a good amount of pork and also came with a side. My son had the pulled pork poutine which was pretty good too. My only complaint is the bun I had with my sandwich was a little dry. Other then that it was pretty tasty. Its located in a rather unassuming strip mall adjacent to a bigger strip mall located by the World Health in Midnapore. I would definitely be back to try something else in the future,"}
{"text":"Yes here for the first time today and I absolutely loved it! A great local business! I used to eat st this location starting from two businesses ago when it was a Ukrainian Fine Foods restaurant and then it was a hotdog place called \"Oh My Dog\" and now this. The decor didn't change much from when it was the Ukrainian restaurant to the hot dog place but when it became the BBQ place it changed a lot! The decor is awesome and it's so friendly. It reminds me of when I travelled to San Antonio, Texas and all the BBQ joints there. It even has old truck doors hanging from the roof for decor which is cool.  I had the nachos today and they were delicious with beans on it and the beef brisket. Can't wait to go back here and try it again :)"}
{"text":"Warning if you have shellfish/seafood allergies DON'T EAT HERE!!! We were very careful and let the waitress know my boyfriend had a shellfish allergy. She assured us that she informed the chef and that we were okay. My boyfriend got extremely ill and had a severe allergic reaction. More training for staff on foods with hidden shellfish is required!"}
{"text":"Unreal!  This place is amaze-balls!!  They actually successfully converted us from vegans to full blown meat eaters (you think I'm joking).  The service is incredible, the beers craft (and delicious) and the smoked meat is life changing."}
{"text":"Cute little spot! It was not at all busy when we went. I love the decor, especially the different state tables...Being from Iowa, it sort of reminded me of home and that made me smile... The waitress was kind and very friendly. I enjoyed the crafted cocktails and thought the food was delicious. Also loved being able to sample all the flavors of bbq to decide which ones to put on my pulled pork sandwich. My husband thought it was a little pricey, but I've paid more for food I cared less for. I also like that it is pretty close to where we live and I do a fair bit of shopping in that area, so I'll likely come for lunch fairly often. Good job!"}
