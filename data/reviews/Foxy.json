{"text":"The service is warm and attentive. The food was beautifully executed, and we were delighted by the surprising combination of flavors. We had the clams, hanger steak, and chicken. The decor is modern and intimate. This is a meal I will be talking about for a long time."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Nice atmosphere. But the tables are too close together. I had the flatbread for starter. It was very salty. Had the hanger steak for main and it was also very salty. Overpriced. I wouldn't be a rush to go back here."}
{"text":"What an awesome dining experience!   At first we were a bit hesitant as we arrived for Our reservation and were not actually seated at our table until 20 minutes after. This was very frustrating but seemed to be a trend at several of the restaurants even experienced on our trip to Montreal.  Despite not being seated, we still received excellent service for drinks and water!  Once seated everything was uphill from there! The food was AMAZING. My most favourite restaurant experience in Montreal.  Recommend:  Pita with feta to start  Hanger steak as a main.  The hanger steak was outstanding.   The atmosphere was nice and new. Very well done."}
{"text":"I am writing this review between my appetizers and my actual meal and it's already five out of five. Great service, great food, great ambience."}
{"text":"Sadly did not realize until it was too late that they screw people with reservations with whatever seats they have available, usually bar seats. We complained and were offered seats at the back (shared) table and unfortunately we took them. Food was okay at best but the service was absolutely atrocious. We waited about two hours for our entree and in the meantime were choking on tons of smoke from the oven and cold comfort from the shitastic (narrow, crappy, overpriced) wine list. Stay away."}
{"text":"This place was really loud and crowded with slow service. Food was okay: flatbread tasted fine but was very burnt, dishes are under-seasoned probably because they want to bring out the freshness of the produce (except that they are not that fresh and tasty). Will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant I've ever been to. Value is pretty good in comparison to some of the other top restaurants in Montréal.  Saw recommendations on Eater's review to get the steak and to try the flatbread. Ended up getting the steak and it was amazing. Served with grilled lettuce and cabbage topped with a parmesan vinaigrette. I also finished my meal with the best dessert I've ever had. A warm chocolatety brownie with hints of coffee, served with house-made coffee ice cream, warm ganache, and some other accompaniments that I do not remember 3 days later.  It was a very cozy restaurant, warm from the open kitchen and wood-fire oven. Service was pretty great, even though we did have to wait a while for our food. Maybe an hour? But other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"Very confused about the good reviews for this place. Went for dinner, party of two. The service was great, really good wine list. It's a cosy place with a nice atmosphere, but the food was (actually) bad.  We had two appetizers (corn/chicken tamale, $17 & cod/chili smashed cucumbers, $18), two mains (gnocchi, $32 and ribs, $35), and a bottle of wine.   Everything was lukewarm/room temperature, really small portions, not at all tasty or satisfying. The tamale was wet, deconstrucuted in a bowl, covered with a forest of raw coriander that overpowered everything else. The cod dish was flavourless and the fish was overdone. The gnocchi was maybe the biggest disappointment - grainy and oily, texture of leftover lasagna, whole hazelnuts that overpowered the chanterelle flavour. The rib dish was six small pork ribs floating in this watery fish sauce dressing covered with raw vegetables (the ribs were somehow dry despite the amount of liquid in the bowl?)...   Really disappointing as we were looking forward to trying this place for some time, but left totally unsatisfied with everything we tasted. Made worse by the fact that the prices are twice what they are at other places in the neighbourhood. There are many restaurants around there with really high quality and delicious food - what's going on here!"}
{"text":"This is a great, mellow neighborhood restaurant. The food was excellent. The service was good, but the kitchen was a little slow. We really enjoyed our pita with peaches and feta, our tomatillo chicken and our tomato and melon salad. We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"J'ai passé une fantastique soirée au Foxy avec ma conjointe. L'accueil a été fort agréable, notre table n'était pas prête à notre arrivée, mais l'hôtesse nous a trouvé une place au bar en attendant. Le délais pour s'asseoir a été juste suffisant pour pouvoir se réchauffer de notre 20 minutes de marche à un froid de canard. La place assise était juste à côté du four à pain qui dégageait une chaleur réconfortante.  La bouffe était délectable! Le pain naan fait sur place, le poisson grillé et même l'assiette de choux-fleurs était délicieuse (je déteste les choux-fleurs depuis toujours).   Nous avons pris le choux-fleurs noirci, le fêta maison, les palourdes et le loup de mer . Nous avons tout partagé à deux et c'était vraiment trop bon. Le point le plus fort de la soirée n'est par contre pas la bouffe, mais le service! Le serveur Frederic nous a vraiment pris en charge. Nous n'avons rien choisi sur le menu, il s'est chargé de nous apporter la combinaison qu'il croyait la meilleure et il a misé dans le mille! Le vin suggéré s'accordait parfaitement avec les mets, il a été super sympathique et offrait un service sincère et authentique. Il nous a accompagné le désert d'un digestif parfaitement accordé au chocolat qui a conclu le tout de façon admirable.  Je n'avais pas eu une expérience de restauration aussi épatante depuis longtemps!"}
{"text":"Foxy was amazing. The vibe was cool, the decor is the usual brilliance you see in Montreal. That's all good but the most important factor is the food. The menu is simple but brilliant. The Zucchini flower flat bread was a rare perfect treat. This is a charcoal place but don't expect any kind of southern BBQ. I had the ribs and I've never had any thing like them. They were charred (not burnt)until crispy on the exterior soft, moist and full of meaty goodness on the inside and only gently seasoned. I will dream of these ribs. My partner had the hanger steak which was also done to perfection and truly medium rare.  The service was great, I forgot to order a side and it came quickly when I asked for it after my ribs were served. It is on the pricy side when you consider you need to order a side separately. A great place for a date."}
{"text":"Everything from the service and food was fabulous. My only complaint was that the flatbread was quite costly for such small portions- even though they tasted heavenly!"}
{"text":"We had reservations at 730PM on a Friday evening, we showed up on time and we're seated around 10 minutes later. The decor is beautiful and I love the wall with pictures of what I feel should be a fox but looks more like a dog. As we sat down our first waiter told us they had a full bar, but when we ordered a rye and ginger our second waiter admitted to mainly only have the ingredients for common cocktails. Disappointed, I ordered the paperplane cocktail which was delicious. For food we ordered and shared :  The feta maison The marinated artichoke and dill flatbread  The grilled scallops The lemon charred greens The clementine cornbread  The feta maison was AMAZING and came with a homemade buttered pita bread, perfect for sharing. The flatbread was flavourful but very small, I'd say smaller than a personal pizza. The grilled scallops were divine and I can't wait to have it again. Unfortunately the lemon charred greens were very...very sour. I'm hoping this was a fluke but along with the small flatbread and the \"full bar\" incident I left feeling on the fence about my overall experience. The desert was odd, I'm used to eating cornbread with lots of salt and butter, not sugar, although the the homemade vanilla ice cream was really really good. I plan on going back, try a different side and desert along with the feta maison again. In a nutshell, I'd say small portions with lots of flavours, my advice is don't expect to leave feeling full unless you are willing to spend the money for it. Our total bill with tax and tip (we were two) was 163$."}
{"text":"Top! Super restaurant, très bel intérieur, plats excellents et super service! Je vous le recommande chaudement !!"}
{"text":"A great vibe at Foxy, though we did get the wonderful table in the front window and we did order all three desserts. Small dishes to start were also good and I had a delicious sea bass dish. But you can find good food at many place. It was the understated mood of the room and great service that will bring me back next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent medley of flavors throughout our dinner experience. The service was incredible on top. The warm fire from the open charcoal grill gives an inviting atmosphere. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Atmosphère is great and trendy. Music gets overbearing at times. Flat bread with artichokes is delicious. Wine was overpriced and the menu very limited. What we ate was good but not enough food on the plate for the price . We actually left hungry after a hefty bill."}
{"text":"It's rare for a new restaurant to hit it out of the park, but Foxy gets it right. We shared the duck coleslaw and the artichoke flatbread to start, and the steak and ribs with sides of polenta and yams. Everything was amazing and I would highly recommend it. Big points for the service too, our waitress was helpful, warm, and really friendly."}
{"text":"Déco wow. Tous les coins sont parfaitement design. Je voudrais être là tous les jours juste pour le déco.   Maintenant pour la bouffe, il y a certaine chose que je trouve chère pour ce que c'est. Les flatbread à 20$, je peux manger un au complet et j'aurais encore faim. Les légumes étaient très bonnes mais ça ne valait pas le prix. Le poulet était super juteux et tendre et les ribs aussi. Pour le dessert, c'était bien mais rien d'exceptionnel.   Je suppose qu'il faut qu'il se rattrape avec l'argent qu'ils ont mis pour le déco... :P   Mais en gros, c'est bien. J'y retournerais!"}
{"text":"A must have appetizer is the feta peach with pita, is one of the best starters this diner has ever had. We had the delicious fresh bronzino and the unusual, in a very good way, gnocchi. Our dinner was topped off with a great, smooth glass of red and a superb chocolate mousse. A shout out to our very personable server."}
{"text":"I loved this place. 3 of us asked our server to guide us and everything she suggested was awesome. The homemade feta dish is so flavourful! Cocktails were also very well executed, and service was professional and unpretentious.   We had no room left for dessert, but our shared appetizers and entrées were so delicious that we also shared 3 desserts (we couldn't choose just one!) which were all incredible.  The place is classy but not snobby, dimly lit and cozy. Great for a date or an evening with a smaller group (it's a small space)."}
{"text":"I wanted to give Foxy 5-stars, but it's not quite there.  Food was inspired and memorably delicious. Atmosphere was well done--down to the sliding table lamps. Short of perfect was the somewhat impersonal service and steep price tag.  I'm fine spending $250+ on dinner...   but at that price point it should be amazing on every (not just some) dimensions."}
{"text":"Cute.  We didn't venture into the main courses but grazed on small dishes - all were tasty and well made and balanced and all that. Except for the meatballs which were pretty forgettable.  Cocktail list chock full of interesting things - my favorite bring their Black Dog; kind of a boulevardier with other Amaro in place of Campari. If I recall that correctly."}
{"text":"Si vous vous ennuyez de l'odeur d'un feu de foyer, venez ici. Soyez avisé-e, ce ne sera pas dans ce lieu que vous impressionnerez votre invité-e avec votre nouveau parfum. D'entrée de jeu, même avec des réservations faites longtemps à l'avance, on me propose l'extrémité du comptoir, dans un coin et plutôt sombre de l'endroit. Je rouspète un peu, on m'offre une table en m'avertissant que je devrai avoir quitté 90 minutes plus tard ... Disons que ça commence mal. Assis, on tarde à m'offrir un cocktail. Côté bouffe, l'expérience vaut le détour, malgré des prix relativement élevés. Huîtres fraîches à souhaits accompagnées de sauces maison et raifort frais, \"flat bread\" aux champignons succulent. Si je retourne ce sera pour essayer les grillades dont on me dit grand bien."}
{"text":"the pizza was excellent as a a starter (could be a meal with some salad!)  we also had salad with chevre -  entrees were the skirt steak (Excellent and NOT salty as one reviewer complained)  we had the lobster starter as one entree - delicious (And a little rich) but a smaller and delicious portion  Coquelet was the other entree - which was roasted to perfection... ALL our food was well prepared and with care to produce great and rich taste Without butter or heavy oils  you can't go wrong here - these folks GET food"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 3.5 stars. After reading all of the reviews about Foxy, I knew it was a place I needed to try. I Made a reservation for 2 on Friday night at 9:15 with ease. In short, it was good, but I'm not sure it lived up to the hype.  Atmosphere: Small and cozy are the two words that come to mind. It's a long and narrow building with lots of 2 and 4 tops packed tightly next to each other. Definitely not a place for groups. The staff does a great job of making you feel welcome. My only suggestion is to request a table in the front of the restaurant, because the back of the house gets really warm, thanks to the giant brick oven.  Drinks and Wine list: Nothing spectacular, and the wines by the glass were pretty weak and I think this is what knocked it down from 4 stars. Decent restaurants will have offer a few good wines by the class for couples who can't agree on red or white. I ordered a Manhattan and it was pretty good, considering I'm this far from Manhattan!   Food: Overall, pretty good. We had the pork chop and the sea bass. the pork chop was a solid 5, easily among the best I have ever had. Cooked perfectly and the sweet and spicy flavors of the dish really just worked. I mean, this placed nailed it. The sea bass was pretty unremarkable and I would not order again. We split the winter cole slaw which had apple, brussels sprout leaves and duck confit. Definitely delicious, but it coagulated quickly and got pretty unappealing. For dessert, we split something along the lines of a chocolate mouse. Good to share if you just wan't a taste of something sweet to finish off the meal, but not impossible to finish alone."}
{"text":"Foxy is a classy low key restaurant in Griffintown. The restaurant is small and cozy so don't be surprised if you are seated at the bar, as this must make up 30% of the total seating in the restaurant. Foxy is not the place to come and be seen, it is the place to come and enjoy amazingly well prepared food. The menu is short and thoughtful. Each ingredient has been carefully selected and the result is amazing flovour in every bite. Everything is cooked in a wood burning stove or over a charcoal grill adding a wonderful flavour and aroma to the food and it should be noted an extra degree of difficulty for the chef.    We've been lucky enough to eat here on a number of occasions now, and each time I feel that the food is better than the last. Then I think back and remember clearly how my mind was blown over the food the time before and in the end can never really decided which experience was best.   A couple of visits ago I had messed up our reservation, I made it for the wrong week so the only place they had for us was at a small corner at the chef's bar. As it turned out this is one of the best seats in the house. We got to watch all night as Chef, Leigh Roper, ran her kitchen to precision, managing every order carefully and working shoulder to shoulder with her team over the open flame of the charcoal grill. It was a lot of fun to see and added a real level of appreciation for the work, and sweat, that goes into each and every plate.   Some of our favortie things to order include, Starter: the flatbreads are mind blowing, last night we had to order a second of the tomato and mozzarella topped flatbread as it was so dam good,  home made feta; Mains: you must try the ribs and gnocchi; Side: be sure to order the yams with spicy mayo and the corn that we had yesterday was terrific. Really, no matter what you order you can't go wrong. Everything that we have had has been terrific.   Foxy is definitely our favorite new spot! And a must for anyone who enjoys great food. Here are a couple of key points to manage your expectations:  - Do expect to sit at the bar. It is a small restaurant and this is part of their core seating area (reservations are also highly recommend)  - Don't expect a Griffintown party scene atmosphere; - Do expect to enjoy some of the best and most flovourful food around; - Do expect to spend your money, this is an expensive restaurant; - Don't expect enormous portions. Foxy is about quality not quantity; - Do expect to come home smelling a bit like a campfire (particularly if you are seated towards the back). The ventilation in the restaurant is excellent, as you don't notice any smoke while you are there, but they are cooking over an open wood flame so the aroma will linger on your clothing; and  - Do expect to relax and enjoy!   I'm honestly surprised to see that Foxy does not have an across the board 5 star rating on Yelp as it provides one of the best authentic quality food experience in Montreal,"}
{"text":"I've been pining for Foxy as though it were a fantastic vacation fling.  Even the dessert was unforgettable (I've been ruminating on the memory of it for DAYS) and I'm not normally wowed by desserts.  The cocktails were good and interesting, but really the food made the experience. We shared the peach and feta starter which was perfect, and contained probably the only decent peaches I've had this summer.  The house made pita that came with it was hot, delicious, and brushed with butter. My husband got the gnocchi and cleaned his plate. Clearly it was as good as our server said it would be. I had the hangar steak which was perfectly cooked and the heirloom tomato salad that came with it was incredible. For dessert we got the strawberry frozen yogurt topped with roasted and fresh strawberries and crumbled meringue. That frogurt was to die for. Apparently, it's made with two parts fruit, one part yogurt and that's what makes it so good.    Our server was friendly and the patio was perfect. Foxy, I will return for another magical evening with you."}
{"text":"Dark, cozy atmosphere - the smell of the wood burning fire makes you feel like you're in a (very stylish) cabin.   Service is above average, attentive without over checking on you, with a sense of humor.   Great natural wines by the glass. We had a unique orange wine.   Shared the carrot and home made feta with a pita made in the over that is what actual dreams are made of.   For my main, had the delicious vegetarian gnocchi with chanterelles - so yummy, with a good density and bright, lemony sauce to keep it fresh.  We had some pre-dinner drinks and apps elsewhere so will need to come back to try more and have some dessert, which sounded amazing."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan. I've eaten here on several occasions and have never been disappointed. Service is good and not intrusive. Food is delicious. My friends and I shared flatbread and the feta to start and I ordered a main of lamb w asparagus. The starters were the stars. The feta appetizer is perfection. The lamb was rare/medium w a mint tahini and asparagus. It was amazing. Nothing negative to say. Great dinner spot! Look forward to going there again."}
{"text":"I really really REALLY wanted to love Foxy but unfortunately our experience fell flat.   Came here for dinner last night with a 9:15pm reservation and were seated within about ten minutes to a low table which we appreciated (our reservation was for a high table initially). Having read rave reviews, we ordered the duck coleslaw salad which was good (but not great). We also had a house specialty pita ($6 for one pita!!) which was also good but really not worth the $6. For our mains, we went with the hanger steak and the gnocchi - both highly recommended. The steak was delicious as were the amazing side onions (I could eat those all day and all night), however the gnocchi was just weird. Instead of the typical little nugget form of gnocchi we all know, this one was in square format which I appreciated in terms of creativity. The dish came with a thousand flavours however which I didn't find complemented each other but were rather distracting as a whole. Neither myself nor my partner enjoyed this dish.  Apart from the food, the decor and ambiance are great as was the service. Unfortunately though, that's not enough to make us want to return.   We decided to skip dessert and left paying $120 (w/tx+tip) for two mains, an appetizer, and a pita (no drinks). Honestly, not understanding what the hype is about and will not come back. Sorry Foxy!"}
{"text":"Very beautiful interior and a nice atmosphere. But that's it. Might be a great place for drinks, but not for dining. The food was okay, nothing special, relatively simple and uncreative, but overpriced.  For a starter got a small $22 flatbread pizza. The pizza was covered with large rocks of salt, that completely ruined it for me. For my main course I got a $36 Mt. Laurier hanger steak which wasn't less salty than the pizza. Not sure why they're obsessed with salt there, but based on the other reviews it seems to be a big issue with the place. I'm usually not so sensitive about oversalted food, but there were pure salt rocks in both of my dishes, trust me it's not an overstatement. The server was pretty attentive and helpful at first, but by the time I had to get the bill she decided to keep me waiting until she finished chatting to 2 other tables for 30 more minutes."}
{"text":"Upon fighting the monstrous crowds at Olive & Gourmando, we stumbled upon a card directing us to their sister restaurant, Foxy. So, desperate for a dinner that did not involve blood pudding or extravagantly rich French food that left us broke and hungry, we decided to venture out to Griffintown. Let us get one thing straight -- a town that closely resembles a Harry Potter house name must indeed have splendors of the first-rate variety.  The ambiance has all the makings of a hip and happening restaurant -- heavy wood, great music, and a wood-burning oven that released smells that would not be out of place in heaven (though sans fire, at least from the frescoes I've seen). The \"it factor\" is really embodied by the fact that everything comes forth from the wood-burning oven. Meat. Vegetable. The lot, really.   The service was friendly and the wine selection robust. Food is intended to be shared and so the four of us ordered the cauliflower, flat breads, and feta dishes to start. All were excellent, though the cauliflower was a particular standout. For mains, we dabbled in steak, fish, and chicken dishes. All were delicious and flavorful, though the chicken was especially noteworthy. Pair that with a side of yams and you're in for a real treat. On a subsequent outing, we also had the clams, which were similarly delicious.  This is the type of restaurant that will serve Montreal well. It is unpretentious enough to serve as a reunion dinner spot for a small group of friends, but warm and cozy enough to be a good date spot. If you are interested in hearty and delicious food, this is certainly one restaurant that should be on your radar. Not all the dishes are created equal and it is on the expensive side, but - compared with some of the other \"destination restaurants\" in Montreal - serves food of a consistently high standard.  Good spot for: foodies; tourists who don't want to be exploited at the \"old school\" French eateries; couples; small groups."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Food was quite overpriced: $22 for a gooey tart-like pizza and $34 for a salty flank steak.   Everything was very salty (that might even be an understatement), and my party's consensus was that the restaurant was greatly overrated given the lofty reviews it received online.   If you feel like you must come here, get the chicken main dish. We ordered the flat bread starter, chicken, steak, and pork loin and the chicken was \"best\" (ie. Least salty) out of the bunch."}
{"text":"Great vibe and amazing food. Only bummer is that they've registered with credit cards as a \"caterer\" so if you use a card with \"restaurants\" as a reward category and are expecting multiple %'s back on your splurge purchase, you're going to be disappointed. Credit card issuers say there's nothing they can do and claim it's the manner in which Foxy has identified themselves in the registration process (to what benefit, I have no idea). A bit of a drag but hey, maybe they can fix that..."}
{"text":"I hate leaving a restaurant hungry...this is the case here. Small freaking portions. Don't care about the $ just feed me Dudes. Yes, we got Entrees, Main and Dessert...still had to stop for a slice of pizza on the way home. What gives. Yes, true, I did like the food, wine, blah, blah, blah...put more of it into the plates. Damn it. Thx!!"}
{"text":"We went to dinner here a bit over a year ago and still talk about how fabulous it was. The food absolutely phenomenal. Next time we are back in Montreal we will certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Visually this restaurant is about as good as it gets in Montreal. The decor and ambiance are superb. Service and food-wise everything is very good and there are some interesting things on the menu, although I felt like the food fell a little short of my expectations. Don't get me wrong though, it's still a nice new restaurant that you should check out when you get a chance."}
{"text":"This is the fancier, prettier sister restaurant of Olive et Gourmando. The menu is pretty small, but everything we had on it (particularly the appetizers) was wonderful.  My wife and I had the feta, the coleslaw, the cauliflower, and some red wine. Definitely on the more expensive side - but worth it for the quality and service. Our waiters were patient in addressing all our questions about the red wine portion of the menu.  If you want a great meal with a trendy vibe and don't mind paying a bit more than average, look into Foxy."}
{"text":"Un beau décor, une belle ambiance, service impeccable, cuisine préparée sur le feu.  La salade de betteraves et les flatbreads étaient délicieux. Des plats frais, parfumés et audacieux. Nous étions plusieurs, j'ai pu goûter aussi aux pétoncles sur purée d'artichauts de Jérusalem ainsi qu'à la morue et chili de concombres.    Un service impeccable, une facture plus que raisonnable"}
{"text":"What a beautifully designed restaurant. You walk in and you smell the wood fired oven, you can see the embers and their glow and are greeted warmly.  We sat at the bar this past weekend and were excited for a great meal, unfortunately it was probably the worst meal we had the entire weekend. Service was incredibly slow, we watched everyone throughout the restaurant get their food, people who sat down 30 mins after us. I think the bartender forgot to put in our food and he had to ask us again what we ordered.   The food was the main disaster. First course was a $20 pizza that was more like a tart that was sloppy and tiny, more like a tart. No flavor and no apples despite that being on the description.  The gnochi $32 is the tiniest dish i've ever seen, maybe 5 noodles on the plate and 4 mushrooms to go with. When I asked the bartender about the plate, he gave a very dumbfounded answer and said \"I don't know what to say, it is what it is.\" The steak dish $34 was even worse, chewy flank steak covered in a salty dressing (tasted like ranch) with some barely cooked tomatoes and onions. Not worth the money at all."}
{"text":"Location: In the Southwest, on Notre-Dame between Guy and Richmond. Street parking is available, but you'll probably find a spot more easily on St. Jacques. The subway is a pretty far walk so if you don't have a car then use Uber or a cab.  The place: I'd say the decor seems to be in line with most of the other restaurants in this area - small, wood, dimly lit. Maybe you can see the kitchen. It's cozy but does get loud. The tables, as other reviewers have stated, are close together. We lucked out and got a 2-top against a wall, and had no one beside us.   The goods: OK, well, I'm not going to sugarcoat; I had high hopes when I booked here. I wanted to love it, because I am a huge fan of Olive & Gourmando, their other restaurant. But they fell short on a few fronts. First, the main ingredient in ALL their dishes seems to be salt. I like salt - but I don't want to be chewing on it all night long. Let's begin with a breakdown of what we had.... first, we ordered cocktails - I don't remember the name but it had the word 'punch' in it. Delicious - we both really enjoyed this refreshing beverage. Since we wanted to go against the masses, we chose to share the Ceviche (chipotle & lime). I've had ceviche at various places, in different cities. I would be lying if I said that this was on par with any of them. It wasn't. First of all, I don't know what type of fish was being used other then to say it was a white fish. Secondly, the very first thing I tasted was salt. So much so, that it overpowered the taste of the fish (which, by the way, was non-existent). You could definitely taste the lime, and I think there was fresh coriander as well. That being said, while the blend of flavors had potential to be great, individually, they were simply too overpowering to make this dish a hit. There was also something crunchy that we couldn't identify, and while we didn't dislike it, it just didn't seem to mesh with everything else. Also, VERY small portion for the price.   For mains, my friend ordered the lamb and I ordered the seafood bucatini. My friend enjoyed the lamb and felt that the portion was adequate for her. Was it worth the price point? I don't know, since I rarely eat meat and I never eat lamb.  On my end, the seafood bucatini was OK but not mind-blowing. I'm sure this comes down to preference, but..... having some Italian blood, and having eaten pasta here and in Italy, I can say that bucatini is just not the right kind of pasta to serve with seafood. I'm sorry - you don't serve tube pasta that you cannot even twirl up on your fork, while gathering a little bit of everything into one mouthful, with seafood. I mean, it wouldn't even stay on my fork, making my attempts to eat, annoyingly well, annoying. If you're going to do this right, I personally, would go with linguini. Anyway, moving on. I thought there were enough shrimp on the plate (and they were quite good) but not many clams (which I didn't really enjoy as much as the shrimp). In terms of flavor, well, I would describe it as lime with chili peppers. The dish was OK, but it was disappointing.  Finally, for dessert, we ordered the chocolate pot à la crème and the cheesecake with Québec strawberries. The pot was great - loved it! The cheesecake was just OK.   Service: Indifferent. Our waitress was polite, but she wasn't attentive. Now, I certainly don't expect to get into lengthy, or personal conversations with wait staff - they have a job to do. But friendly chit chat while you're taking our order or stopping by to check in, would be nice.   Price point: VERY expensive considering the portion sizes and also, the excessive use of stones that may or may not leave me with a few kidney stones with which to fondly remember my experience.  I gave this 3 stars because we liked the space, the cocktails and dessert were great, and the food was OK, but not great."}
{"text":"Same owners as Olive & Gourmando, so I knew it was going to be quality, but I was very curious to see the more chic side of their new dinner concept.  I was very happy with what we ordered but disappointed with the size of the portions. Two little cubes of feta with a pita bread... For like $14. Where is the cheese, chef? The homemade flat breads though... Miam :-) They are savoury, doughy, but again - way too small! Aaaand $20. But of course when you pay that much you expect freshness, quality and a unique taste. Well it did it for me. Suggestion : flat bread w oyster mushrooms and truffle Italian cheese. Delish!! Service was excellent by the way and they are open 7 days a week, dinner only. But if you have a big appetite and don't want to spend $75 for yourself only, Id suggest an Italian or Greek for their generosity :D Bon app!  4 stars for the quality of the food. 3 for the value. 4 stars for the service. 2 stars for the comfort (don't take the banquette... Too high for the table lol)"}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes to get seated even with a reservation. Another 20 minutes to get served bread and water. We got seated next to the stove with some mock bar, barely enough room for the plates, can't imagine why they seat people there. Service was slow at best. Beyond that, food was impeccable. The bread and cheese was amazing. Had to order a second one. The ribs were incredible. Very limited desert options and overpriced. The only reason for the three stars is the food was that good, beyond that, one star at best."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  We had the flatbread, the feta appetizer, and the flank steak.  The dirty margarita was excellent, too.  We had a reservation but were seated at the bar, with very little clearance behind us, which is really my only complaint.  The bartender was friendly, so it wasn't all bad.  I do recommend Foxy."}
{"text":"Upon consulting Yelp for some restaurant recommendations in Griffintown, we stumbled upon Foxy with solid reviews. After looking through some photos online, I was pretty sold. I haven't been to Griffintown in awhile but I know there's a lot of hip and trendy food spots so I'm not holding much expectations.  Good: the decor is sleek, sexy and hip (like your typical upscale hipster restaurant). The food was amazing, it's a bit of the pricey side, but definitely worth the splurge. Beautiful presentations and amazing flavours blended together with different textures, I was just amazed. The servers were very attentive and jovial, which in turn put me in a really good mood too. We had the Charred Cauliflower with yogurt to start (5/5), my boyfriend had the Hangar Steak (didn't try, as I do t eat meat) and I had the cavatelli (4.5/5, only because there wasn't a lot of oyster mushrooms in it...but it was rich and smooth, very hearty). The end the meal, we also had a Pistachio Cake. The pistachio ice cream was a nice touch to the strawberries in a light syrup on top of the fluffy cake.  Bad: nada...the meal, staff, location, everything had been exceptional.  Bottom line: definitely go try, the service is great and the food is even better. If you're a fan of creative flavours, this is the spot."}
{"text":"A definite place to spend date night or to show off with an out-of-town guest. Service on the night of my visit was stellar; wonderful wine and food suggestions, attentive but not overbearing. We started with a fruity Italian white wine, the name escapes me but it was recommended by out sever and perfectly suited our tastes. We started with the cod and the clam appetizers, which were restrained in size but not in taste. The cod had an acidic hit in the light sauce adorning the smashed cucumbers and peanuts, complemented by a touch of heat. The clams were bathed in a tomato-based sauce, with a bed of farro and a slight crunch from almond bread crumbs. We also shared a 75-day aged rib steak for 2, which was grilled to a medium-rare temperature, which is exactly how it should be served. It was accompanied by savory smashed potatoes cooked in duck fat and rosemary. Every bite of the meal was on point, so for all these reasons I have to give my first 5 star review this year."}
{"text":"Foxy opened only a few weeks ago in Griffintown and already it's so popular that walk-ins get turned away. Part of the hype is due to the fact that the owners also own the legendary cafe Olive & Gourmando in the Old Port, which is both a local and tourist favorite. Being a huge fan of O&G's simple but quality food and service, I was very excited to try Foxy.  I went there on a Wednesday night. The service was very personable and efficient; I liked that our waitress was not pushy, and really gave us time to enjoy the entire experience. My friend and I shared the feta app, the artichoke flatbread, the bbq chicken and the charred greens.   Everything was a delight. The homemade feta with tomatoes, grapes and almonds came out of the wood-oven piping hot. Since the owners are both professional bakers, I was not surprised at how amazing the flatbread was. It was the perfect side to scoop up the hot and heavily spiced feta. My only complaint is that the feta was a bit too salty, but it was so unique and tasty that it really didn't matter in the end.   The marinated artichoke flatbread tasted great- they really have serious baking skills! The mortar and pestle romesco sauce on the chicken was also a highlight. So flavorful. But if I had to pick a favorite dish I would have to go with the charred greens. I know, sounds boring compared to the rest of the menu. I wouldn't have ordered it either if the waitress hadn't recommended it. But it ended up being smoky, bright, and simply fantastic.  The team behind Foxy and O&G really prove that tasty and interesting food can be served in a beautiful and casual setting. Loved it and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sat outside on the terrace on a lovely summer evening with an old friend. Service was friendly, patient and courteous. We started off with a cocktail and hoping to order a bottle of wine but sadly the wine list is not good.  Starts at $45 for a Cahors then a Beaujelais (which we had no interest in) for $50 then quickly jumps to a few choices at $60 and quickly up, up & up! Way too expensive of a wine list in my opinion. And only 3 sad choices by the glass in both white &:red.  Not impressive by any means. I do hope they improve on that front. Food was good and fresh but I agree with other reviewers, the portions were overly small. Pricey with poor wine list or choices by the glass, but saving grace... food was good! Long term, I think they will need to offer more value if they want to sustain themselves....i. my humble opinion!"}
{"text":"A wonderful experience all the way around. Hadn't expected it to be as good as it was. We showed up without reservations and sat on their terrace. The service was quick, friendly and professional and the food was delicious. I ordered the homemade pasta (sooooo good), and my husband and and son ordered the chicken (possibly better). The pistachio cake soaked in orange sauce, with buttermilk ice cream was to die for."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had an awesome bartender that helped make the experience awesome. Ate the special which was the ribsteak and was awesome. Had asparagus and the cauliflower appetizers which were awesome. Venue is small but very cool"}
{"text":"Very pricey, and not outstanding. After hearing good things, was eXpecting something more. Had the Cod, cooked really well but too many complicated flavours in the sauce. Beets - ok, potato salad - ok, artichoke flatbread - ok. Hangar steak apparently only cooked medium well-done??? What happened to the diner having a choice?? Requested well-done but still wasn't. And not a potato to go with? Identity problem with this place, don't know who they're trying to appeal to.."}
{"text":"When u see a small menu at a restaurant, u always must somewhat assume that the place is serving seasonal items that are fresh and delicious. Assumptions correct here!!! Service was amazing, seating on terrace was great with gorgeous evening in mid June. Would defo come back!"}
{"text":"My expectations were high because they made the Canada's best 100 list within their first year which I thought was pretty impressive  I was not let down  We started the evening with the flat bread and the pulled duck coleslaw I thought the flat bread was really good but a tad too salty even for me (I love salt) .  The pulled duck coleslaw was outstanding and fresh. It sits on a celery-rave and apple purée that wasn't too overpowering so i liked it a lot.  We had the beef onglet and chicken as main courses.  Both were really good. I love acidic flavors and I felt like they used lots of it for both plate. We had one desert to share because we were pretty full: a chocolate waffle with ice cream and pecans. It was ok nothing to die over.  But I'm not crazy about chocolate so don't take my word for it.  We had wine by the glass. Good selection. Service was ok and effective  The restaurant is really small and the tables are really close to each other.  It's on the pricey side The menu is really short and sweet which I like so I don't spend 5 hrs trying to choose.  This place definitely deserves its place on the list.  Tip: Do reserve ahead"}
{"text":"The reviews for this place are extremely inflated. We had a reservation and they say us at the bar next to on another with a view of the coffee pot. The food takes way too long and is not impressive, especially for the prices. The ambiance is loud and crowded -- I came from Brooklyn and if I wanted a subpar, overpriced dining experience I would have just taken the bridge over to the city. Pass on this one."}
{"text":"That restaurant is amazing .The food is so good.is my new découverte in Montréal . I recommend that restaurant .if you want to go in the week end you better to reserve in advance"}
{"text":"Everything about Foxy is perfect- the atmosphere, the food, the drinks, the service. This is a must go to in my book! We came on a rainy night and Foxy was wonderfully cozy. We got the cashew hummus, eggplant purée and cauliflower to start. WOW I could eat that hummus everyday. Eggplant purée was the only thing we didn't like. For entrées, we shared the cavatelli and sea bass. They were both fantastic. We finished the meal with the brownie. YUM- don't miss it if you love a good fudgy brownie. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant because we absolutely love Olive et Gourmando but we were disappointed. We ordered the scallops, duck coleslaw and the rib steak to share. The apps were great but the main took 1 hour to get to our table and it was basic to say the least. We were told that the steak would be cooked to medium rare but parts of the steak were very well done and some parts were raw. I mean there was 1 slice that was cooked perfectly. Seasoning was slight and the sides were just ok. For $200 I don't think we will be back. Very unremarkable."}
{"text":"Menu is very limited, servings are small, and I'm afraid I didn't find it to be anything special. When a place is this expensive and hyped up, it should blow you away."}
{"text":"What else could you expect from the wonderful people at Olive et Gourmando?! A delightful spot with delectable cocktails and inventive dishes. We cobbled together a delicious meal from several small plates and every single one was scrummy. My fave had to be either the squash blossom flatbread or the pulled pork with celery slaw. Or maybe the house made feta, cucumbers, and peaches with a big puff pita, or maybe... you get the drift, right? Just go."}
{"text":"The ambiance is excellent; however, I had some problems with my visit. First, despite reservations, we were given seats at the bar. To me, seats at the bar are for walk ins. Not people with reservations.   Drinks and small plates were tasty. My main entree I had an issue with. My sea bass had a very nice presentation, but the skin was too heavily salted. The sauce did cut it a bit. Yet it was just too much salt. Restraint was needed with the sodium."}
{"text":"One of the most incredible meals of my life. The food was inventive, flavorful, and well-balanced (and we ate about half the menu!). Our server was kind, engaging, and knowledgeable. She really took control of our dining experience and steered us towards a delicious and unique bottle of wine that satisfied all of our diverse tastes at the table.  Additionally, we were visiting Montreal for my birthday, and when they overheard that it was a celebratory meal they went out of their way to include a candle with dessert, which was so thoughtful. Truly can't say enough good things, and if I'm ever back in Montreal Foxy will be my first stop!"}
{"text":"Super nice evening here last night with a friend in from out of town! We arrived a little early for our 8pm reservation but they sat us right away. The service from beginning to end was perfectly warm, smart, friendly and perfectly bilingual. The layout and design is great, I love the dark shades of slate grey and black reflecting the light of the fire.   The Paper Planes cocktail I started with was tart and perfectly balanced and I could have drank a pint of it. We shared the house feta and the winter slaw with duck and the flat bread with ham, we weren't starving so this was a perfect amount of food for us. The flavours in each plate were especially enjoyable for their unique combinations and fresh local Quebec ingredients.   There was a line by the time we left so definitely make a reservation and enjoy! We definitely did."}
{"text":"We were excited about Foxy given its critical acclaim, but we were disappointed. The food was fine, but nothing to write home about. Our cocktails were good, but not very creative. Neither was the menu. The service was... VERY attentive. Maybe awkwardly attentive. All said, I would say that Foxy is an OK, high-end neighborhood spot, except it is OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced. Much better eats in the city for the price point."}
{"text":"Came here during my parents' visit. Started off by sharing a 2 person salad a winter slaw and a shiitake flat bread. The salad was good but the slaw was hmm..hmm..hmm delicious. That's right, so delicious you wanna hum while enjoying every bite. With its delicate flavours the flat bread was also an instant favourite. For mains we had the BBQ ribs, the bavette and Cornish hen. All the dishes were delicious but the bavette stood out. One of the best Bavettes I've had. Dessert, I don't recall the details other than yummy because I was already in a foodgasm..."}
{"text":"A delicious, fiery adventure.  First, make sure to request the kitchen seats facing the wood-fired oven. It'll be hot and toasty, but it makes the experience so much more special as you see your food be made and cooked with expertise. However, avoid the wall facing seats.  The restaurant is intimate, perfect for a date. The food is delicious, and the wood-fire adds a certain artisanal flair to each dish.   Romantic, fiery night in mind? Foxy."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious... the service was impeccable and we really enjoyed everything about the meal and the restaurant/ambience...  The desserts were a bit of a disappointment though... only 3 desserts and all contained milk or creme, so not much good for anyone with a dairy intolerance...    Overall, a great experience though, and we would highly recommend and we would come back :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the opportunity to sit at the bar and interact with the oh-so-vibrant barmaid (she was so passionate that she was a mixologist to me). What a wonderful experience! The homemade feta and pita appetizer was everything you want in a dish: salty, sweet because of the Ontario peaches, crunchy thanks to the homemade pita and tangy from the thinly sliced fennel. Just wow!! The oven baked gnocchi is like nothing you ever tasted before. Delish!! We gave Daphné, our waitress/mixologist carte blanche for drinks and wine and she nailed it!! Thank you Foxy for the great experience. We will definitely come back for more :)"}
{"text":"Foods are delicious but service a bit slow!! Nice place, Strongly recommend for couple!"}
{"text":"Since Sarah B has not reviewed from a couple of nights ago, I will go ahead and make this #300.  Sister restaurant of Olive & Gourmando, which is a favourite of mine, so was excited to go there.  Excellent company, food, service and ambience. Three of us shared: Honeycrisp flatbread House Feta with pita, almonds and roasted grapes Hanger steak 2 x Gnocchi with ricotta, toasted hazelnuts, chanterelle mushrooms and  and shavings of Parmesan.  Everything was delicious. I'm not a big fan of feta, but wanted to try it after all the reviews. Mmmm. The gnocchi was incredible and I wish I could have it again and again.  I wasn't drinking so our server asked what I liked, she thought about what we were eating, and brought me back something lemon, mint, basil and sparkling. It was just right.  No room for dessert."}
{"text":"'Late night at Foxy'  Moi et mon ami avons appelé pour réserver verd 20h30, il n'y avait de la place qu'à 21h30... Ça montre la popularité du restaurant auquel il est IMPOSSIBLE d'aller sans avoir de réservation. C'est toujours plein !   Bref à 21h30 nous nous sommes assis.  Le décor de l'endroit est très moderne, très cauzy avec le feu de foyer, il y a vraiment une ambiance feutrée parfait si vous souhaitez une soirée romantique.   Nous avons dégustez 12 huitres en entrée. Si les huitres étaient bonnes, il n'y avait toutefois aucune mignonette digne de ce nom. tabasco et mignonette au raiford, ça fait ordinaire un peu.   Mon ami a commandé l'onglet de boeuf et moi le loup de mer. WOW ! Ils étaient bien cuit, originaux, assaisonnés à la perfection.   Nous avons eu du bon service. Notre serveur connnaissait les plats sur le bout des doigts et nous a suggéré un excellent vin. Toutefois l'heure à laquelle nous avons mangé pourrait expliquer ce bon service, il y a toujours moins de monde à 22h versus 19h."}
{"text":"New restaurant from the beloved Olive and Gourmando, but with a completely different vibe and decor. Very rustic chic, keeping up with the hipster takeover of new Montreal restaurants. Good ambiance for a night with a small group of friends or a date at the bar. However, it can get quite loud. The menu has less than 15 items or so but showed a good diversity and the ones we ordered were well executed.  Coup de Coeur of the night was the winter coldslaw with duck effiloché. Perfect bite of fresh, sweet and savoury with a touch of acid. A must try! We also had the house feta, first bites were very tasty but got very salty as the dish was cleaned. Flat bread with artichokes and dill was also a winner but can get heavy so grab a friend to share.  Would definitely go back if they update their menu seasonally."}
{"text":"Good spot for a date and very pleasant overall dining experience. Delicious food prepared with locally sourced ingredients and cooked to perfection. Service is great. A must-try in the city!"}
{"text":"First time we went (when they first opened) it was incredible. Food was great, service was great etc.   Took my friend from out of town and the service was not great. The hostess had the worst attitude I've ever come across at a restaurant...the sever didn't know much about wine and suggested we talk to the sommelier but in the same breath told us the sommelier was too busy??? We actually had to send our wine back because it was nothing like our server described it.   Food was good, experience was awful! So many great restaurants to try in the city, not sure I'll be back to this one"}
{"text":"Ahhh!!! My favorite place! We go to olive and gourmando for breakfast almost every day, and it's totally worth the wait, this is there sister restaurant for dinner! And it's just FABULOUS!!!! : )  The decor, the food, the service, the ambiance! The people... it's GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Erik, for a lovely birthday dinner for our group. We visited a couple weeks ago from Chicago, IL. For me, it was a first visit to Montreal and I was pleased with the excellent first impression at Foxy.   Our group chose a pre-fixe menu with three courses. Highlights included the baked feta & the gnocchi--I mean, we are STILL talking about this Roman-style gnocchi! Erik (sorry if the spelling is off!) was attentive but never hovering. His wine and cocktail recommendations were perfect. We all had different palates and hopes for our drinking life that night and Erik stepped into each conversation with generosity & confidence. We loved the seamless service he gave and how it allowed us to enjoy one another through the course of the meal...which was the entire point of taking a holiday together.  Many in our group are service industry vets & members. Two of us own food & hospitality businesses in Chicago. We are quite far from novice diners, and from an amazing food city. To be honest...I think we can be a hard group to please, and even more to impress. Even so, both Erik & Foxy impressed us thoroughly. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here on Friday at 6 pm on the terrace. They let us know in advance on the phone that there was a table after us at 8 pm sharp and that we were to leave before then but by the time we finished eating and paid it was close to 9 pm. They did not try to rush us out and we did not feel pressured to leave. The staff was very nice and did a good job making sure our needs were met... for example,  always making sure our glasses were filled with water etc. My friend and I started with the Hey Honey! cocktail which consisted of gin , honey, lemon and cava. It sounds like something one would drink if they were sick but it did not taste like medicine. It wasn't too sweet and it wasn't bitter. It was so light and refreshing and foamy on top. My friend had two because it was that good while I tried the Foxy Caesar ( bourbon , horseradish , hot sauce ). It was very flavourful and filling. We shared two appetizers  and  had our own mains. The two dishes that stood out the most and that I recommend are 1) the heirloom tomato flatbread with burrata and basil and 2) the homemade feta with peaches , cucumber, onions, summer honey. These two \"first bites\"  don't look very impressive at first glance but they taste great. The flatbread looks like homemade pizza but the bread is so good that I don't think people at home can recreate it. The feta looks small if shared but it comes with a big puffy pita and the dish is quite satisfying. I had the hanger steak which came with tomato and onion salad. It was cooked the way I like it ... medium rare. And although it was good I know I will only remember the flatbread and feta months from now.  My friend had the grilled trout and we shared the yams with spicy mayo to go with our mains. I was expecting the yams to be fries but they were big wedges. It tasted fine but we couldn't finish it because we were full. This is a cute restaurant and I think it's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The food at Foxy literally took my breath away! The presentation is beautiful and the food was so delicious, I was almost brought to tears! I had the lobster starter and the gnocchi for the main course! I had chocolate mousse with caramel crunchies on top. It was AMAZING!! A must-eat-at place in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Entrees were excellent, but dessert featured a pear that was not ripe and not edible. Server thanked me for letting her know but left the charge on the bill. Very bad form and therefore I am giving the 4 star rating."}
{"text":"My expectations were pretty high since I'm a big fan of Olive + Gourmando. Yes, this restaurant is the new outfit of Dyan Solomon and Eric Girard from O+G. And I was not disappointed.  The restaurant by itself is spectacular. The restaurant has a very welcoming and warm atmosphere, despite the industrial decor. But the superb wood fired oven is probably not a stranger to that.  The star of the restaurant is the food, which is mostly cooked on that wood fired oven. The chef is quite young but has an impressive resume. Her name is Leigh Roper, and she made her classes with David McMillan and Fred Morin at Joe Beef, Liverpool House and Vin Papillon, and interships at the well known Tartine Bakery and Café, Chez Panisse et Chez Quince on the West Coast.  As our first course, we had the tiny grilled beets salad, which was perfect with the minty labneh, and the November coleslaw with spit-roasted duck. Absolutely divine.  For our main course, we had the scallops, which were perfectly cooked, and the grilled hanger steak. The steak size was generous and delicious and perfectly seasoned. No complaints there. The grelot potatoes cooked on the oven were tasty.  Really, I do not have any complaints. It's pretty rare that I find a restaurant executing everything so perfectly, from food to service, from decor to drinks. If I had one negative thing to say, and its a very minor one, is that no bread was served with the meal. I love bread, and with O+G's expertise in bread, I was expecting some. But again, everything else was so perfect that it is a minor fault.  I will definitely return, the sooner the better :D"}
{"text":"Wow just wow!! Talk about amazing. The food was one of the best meals ever. Everything we put in our mouths was incredible. Bar tender is super sweet and engaging. The were super busy but she still took the time to talk to us and was genuinely interested in our conversation. Very cool decor. Great place"}
{"text":"Foxy wins on ambiance and food. Fresh flowers everywhere and the interior decoration is super sexy. We loved every single dish we ordered (corn, yams, flatbread, house made feta with pita, cauliflower, and the hanger steak and sausage entrees). Cocktails are also executed perfectly.   So why not five stars? Just a few hours after we left, I was already starving! We were a group of 4 but I don't think we should be that hungry if we ordered 3 appetizers, 2 entrees 2 sides and 2 desserts. Maybe we should have ordered 1 more entree. Also the food took a long time to come out to our table.   I would definitely come back to Foxy but on a night where I'm feeling really spendy."}
{"text":"Special occasions call for a certain kind of restaurant. A place of intimacy and finesse with killer food and a certain coolness as well. We are lucky in Montreal to have many places that suit these criteria. For this particular occasion - My fiancé and I celebrating our anniversary - we chose to try a restaurant in our neighbourhood that I had been dying to try - Foxy.  Located on the restaurant row that is Notre Dame Street in St-Henri and Little Burgundy, Foxy is the sister restaurant of Old Port staple bakery Olive+Gourmando. The space is long and narrow with an open kitchen about midway with lots of low lighting and a beautiful bar straight across. I had heard that the room could get very loud and noisy at times but we were there on a quiet night so that wasn't at all an issue.  Foxy's menu works around grilling over a live fire or roasting in a wood-burning oven. The menu is smallish but every dish inspired interest from both of us. We first started with a couple of entrées. The winter coleslaw composed of brussel sprouts, savoy cabbage, apple, duck confit and celery root puree was a big hit for me. Beautiful presentation and a very hearty portion as a appetizer. The flavour of the duck came through primarily but each of the other element brought something nice in terms of flavours and texture. The addition of what seemed like a cider vinaigrette added a nice acidic kick to top it all off. Probably as great a winter salad as I have had.  Our second dish was roasted cauliflower served with turmeric, zoug yogurt, fried shallots and almonds. Another hit for us - tons of flavours coming through with the roasted vegetable, the crunchy sweetness of the shallots, the heat of the turmeric and the coolness of the yogourt. Another hearty portion as well.  The positive vibes continued through the main courses. I went with the herb sausage served with pecorino cheese, mashed potatoes, blackened brussel sprouts and house gravy. Delicious from beginning to end. The herb sausage was surprisingly spicy but the addition of the cheese paired well with that. The mash and gravy mix is always a good one and more lovely roasted sprouts didn't hurt either.  My fiancé went with the charcoal grilled sea bass served with aioli and cucumber celery salad. The charred sea bass was beautiful and had such a great grilled flavour to it. Just add a little lemon and we're good. Even better though was the house aioli - great consistency and very strong flavour. Perfect complement to the fish. I don't care much for a cucumber salad but my fiancé loved it so we're good ;)  Dessert options seemed wonderful - the chocolate bourbon brownie had me at hello - but the portions of our dishes were so generous that we were completely full and needed to pass.... Too bad but a good sign otherwise! Add to that great food very solid service throughout the night and we left Foxy very satisfied with our meal and our choice of venue for our occasion. We continued to get spoiled in Montreal for the quality of our restaurants. Foxy quickly made its way up our list of go-tos. The fact that we can walk to it from our place just makes it even better. Now I guess I should finally go to Olive+Gourmando now.....  Cheers!"}
{"text":"My meal was tasty (ceviche, ribs, and flatbread) and the wood oven is cool...But the evening was ruined by a middle aged bald french waiter who repeatedly ignored us and acted rudely. For example if we asked him to repeat the second special, he would say \"i dunno\" and then he regularly did not take all of our orders, skipping people at the table even it they raised their hand to signal blatantly that they wanted to put in an order. Next if we asked for a house brandy, he said they did not have such a thing without offering any options. This is just a few examples. The rest of staff were wonderful! I guess we got the snotty apple! :/"}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal we had in Montréal. Including L'Express, Candide, and *gasp* Au Pied de Cochon (all of which were DELICIOUS, but understand me, Foxy is IT). We ate snowcrab so perfect it could have gone unseasoned, but then again, that Thai-inspired, buttery jous was so extraordinary, we risked filling up on bread just to have some vehicle to keep eating it once the meat was gone. Flatbread to rival pizza in Naples, creative veggie dishes, excellent steak and an unforgettable little cake for dessert with fresh berries and housemade ice cream. The service was excellent, the vibe was lovely and I legit couldn't recommend this place more highly."}
{"text":"Underwhelming to say the least. I really don't know what the buzz is about. Small,tightly packed tables,loud and uncomfortable seating. The food is good for a neighbourhood restuarant, bland so oversalted to boost the flavour. Not a taste-bud orgasm, none of our group felt it was worth the cost or worth returning to this restuarant in future. Service is friendly and a bit slow, bar is meagre. Pricey for what it is. If you live within 4 blocks its a convenient place but otherwise save your money."}
{"text":"This place was excellent.  Easily the best meal we had in Montreal - and we ate at some great places.  Everything was fresh, innovative, yet comforting.  I like that the menu is limited so they can focus on a few items at a time.  I had the roast chicken.  I was not going to get it because, well it's chicken and some of the other options sounded better.  The table next to us ordered it though and when I saw how rustic and delicious it looks, I had to try it (also the server strongly recommended it).  I did not regret the decision.  IT was moist, well seasoned and had some interesting takes on the base sauces.  I ordered a gin martini with a new gin - Monkey47.  The bartender came over to our table to discuss with me how I liked my martinis and what ratio of vermouth to gin she recommended.  She later came over to see how I liked it.  It was a seriously good martini, backed up by amazing  service.  Highly recommend Foxy."}
