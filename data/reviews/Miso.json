{"text":"I agree with most of the reviews that the food here is way over priced and that it is most likely not the best sushi in town.  However the decor, ambience and service is great and worth the while, it is modern and very peaceful environment, unlike other comparable sushi places ( Maiko, Kaizen,..). I disagree with the reviews that mention that the service is not good, they have friendly and smiling staff and are more or less prompt."}
{"text":"Expensive for the quality of food. Not the best sushi I've tasted. Nice staff though."}
{"text":"Expensive sushis, sloppy preparation, slow service... I was overall disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely a keeper for brunch!  I went with a friend over the weekend, because we couldn't decide whether to get breakfast or lunch.  We ended up ordering the Montagne omelet and the spicy salmon maki.. a little bit of both world.  The omelet had basil and tomatoes throughout, with a large slab of goats cheese on top; it also came with fruit, a mini muffin, 2 slices of toast, and delicious hashbrowns.  Definitely a keeper!  The sushi had six small pieces... decent sushi, but far far far too expensive.    The service was wonderfully friendly, complementing the overall relaxing ambiance of the restaurant.  It was a lovely place to go and chat with a friend, while enjoying a nice meal.  I would suggest going to breakfast though, as opposed to later in the day... especially if you're watching your pennies."}
{"text":"Was here with my work. Service was crazy slow, and while we had a table of eight, six of us were served our hot food while those who ordered sushi waited probably 20-30 minutes for their orders. So, the hot food was obviously cold by the time the sushi came. Wait staff kept on being reminded that the sushi was coming, but come on, just bring out the food all at once. The sushi was attractive, but not fresh, leaving me with a \"gross, I just ate that?\" feeling. Not ideal. On the plus side, portions of gross sashimi are large, so do what you will with that."}
{"text":"I was about to find Imadake but ended up here. Ordered a miso soup & some tuna sashimi as starter and a grilled shrimp -- the plating was very good and appetizing, but the food was just mediocre at most.  Funnier thing was even there were just 4 tables, everything was just so slow - waited 5 minutes for a greeting glass of water. While, the two waitress were in fact quite pretty, but they kept standing there chatting with little attention to their guests. I guess the price tag was justified somehow this way."}
{"text":"Le restaurant, situé à proximité de la station Atwater, est une excellente adresse pour les aficionados de la cuisine nippone.  De mémoire, la carte est variée, le cadre agréable ce qui m'a laissé une excellente impression. J'ai apprécié ma commande : des Sushis qui ont parfaitement répondu à mon attente, par leur goût et par leur texture.  Mon passage s'étant soldé par une unique visite, je ne peux en rajoute davantage, mis à part peut être la qualité du service, bienséante."}
{"text":"The service is great, and the food is amazing. The interior decor is very simple and elegant, loved it.  However, their food is really overpriced despite all these qualities, and I really need that \"wow-factor\" if I'm expected to pay over 70$ per person for a dinner."}
{"text":"I ate here Wednesday evening for dinner. The environment was trendy. The rolls were so-so, but the sashimi was excellent (fresh)!"}
{"text":"Miso has excellent quality sushi, mainly the sashimi impressed me a lot, and the price is accordingly high. Like it's a very expensive place. There are other sushi places that are better, but miso has a very stylish ambience.  Like it's too stylish to bring a date, unless you're beta and a habitual tryhard.  No. You bring your out of town clients and wine and dine the shit out of them at Miso. Your spend good money on them and enjoy yourself.  If the company is paying, this is where you go for sushi in Montreal. Case closed."}
{"text":"When I tell you..... The sushi was amazing!!!!! I came in for a pick me up after getting off amtrak and I felt like I found life. The food was great, drinks great, service amazing.... I will be coming back...."}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service. Huge sushi menu, but I didn't try. I started with edamame with sea salt and then teriyaki salmon with rice, which comes on a bed of fresh greens: long-stemmed broccoli and asparagus. All simple, fresh, tasty."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great sushi with amazing spicy mayo sauce. The ambience here is great for a couple looking to enjoy a romantic evening with minimal noise. Outstanding customer service. The sushi chefs were very friendly. I will certainly dine at this place whenever I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"This is a pretty average sushi place.  Decent selection of different rolls and sushi.  Freshness was ok, but found everything to be very bland.  Service was good."}
{"text":"I really wanted imadake my friend said he liked miso so of course I followed the leader since I'm a regular at imadake.  Lunch special for 13.99 sandwich soup and salad. Good price really didn't enjoy it.  The Calamari was so spicy I could barely breath and even tho I hate spice I've grown used to it since my best friends are hot sauce freaks and still this one was killer. Chillis    One thing that they are great at is sushi. If I knew any better I would of just gotten that"}
{"text":"Friendly service.  Always ask what was delivered today though it is usually the salmon as everyone loves it as it is delivered everyday."}
{"text":"The quality of sushi is pretty good even compared to some other fancier places. However I prefer takeouts only because the interior setup and atmosphere seem a bit too cheep for this quality. Plastic teapot and chopsticks. Like seriously?"}
{"text":"Découvert via Mtl à table. Bien. Sushis frais. Menu diversifié, goût non commun. Belle découverte.  Service rapide et courtois.  Est-ce que j'y retournerais...oui Est-ce que je ferais un détour pour y retourner...non"}
{"text":"La qualité y est comme très bonne, mais l'attente est trop longue. Si vous êtes patient, que vous y allez longtemps à l'avance, ça peut valoir le coup, la qualité est vraiment bonne, mais si vous n'êtes pas patient, passez votre chemin."}
{"text":"This is the second sushi place I've been to since I came into town last week, and both have offered up rolls of only 5 pieces rather than the 8 that I'm accustomed to in the US (for the same price!).  Apparently value for money in the sushi realm is one thing that we've got.  Also gun violence and obesity, so I guess you take the good with the bad.  Anyway, at this point I have to assume that a 5-piece roll is the norm here, and I don't see the wild prices that other reviews are claiming of Miso.  In fact, my bill was $23 before tip for two rolls and that's not too bad.  My bill at Kaizen was higher than that for a comparable meal.  The two rolls I ordered were the Spicy Hamachi Roll (I love hamachi!) and the [Something] Bee Roll.  Could have been Angry Bee, or Killer Bee.  I think it was the Killer Bee Roll.  The Spicy Hamachi was a little bit smaller and contained a little spicy mayo.  It was tasty, although maybe a little more heat would have done the trick nicely.  The Killer Bee Roll on the other hand, that was just fantastic.  Large, beautiful pieces tightly and expertly wrapped.  The fish was perfect -- flavorful and fresh tasting pieces of tuna and salmon on the top and I can't remember what on the inside.  It was an overall great flavor and just the right amount of tempura crunch added for texture.  I really hope this is indicative of the quality of their other sushi, because if so I can honestly say that I'm impressed regardless of what these other reviews have claimed. I should mention that I'm not new to sushi. My list of sushi reviews (just the ones I've eaten at since I started keeping track) is here: http://www.yelp.com/list/allkindsazushi-orlando-2   I could have seen this as a 5-star establishment, except the decor where I was sitting reminds me a little of a retirement home cafeteria, just with better lighting.  Most importantly though, my soy sauce dish was sitting at the table covered in dried grains of rice when I arrived, and that's not cool.  Hey, mistakes happen. I got a new one and everything was fine after that.  I'll look forward to coming back after trying a couple more sushi places.  I want to see if all of their rolls are done as well as that Killer Bee Roll."}
{"text":"Very good customer service, nice ambiance but overpriced. They serve the food in HUGE dishes and trays...special effects to fluff the small portions of food. The food quality was OK, nothing special. I spent about 100 bucks in dinner for two and we went home hungry, along the way we stopped at a pizza place, got some pizza and beers and that was more enjoyable than the nancy-fancy Japanese gnosh."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The salmon tartar was by far the best part of the meal! The pork dumplings were also quite delicious. My wife ordered the champion roll and she enjoyed it. I ordered the Bleige Neige miso roll (probably not spelled right). The presentation was spectacular for everything, but the flavor for the miso roll was just ok. I loved the tartar and the waitress was very kind and was able to make a great suggestion for my wife based on an observation. It was a little too expensive I thought, but overall a decent place."}
{"text":"I am not sure of the low ratings but my visit here was very memorable. I went on Valentines Day and they had special live jazz music playing which was a sweet touch. The owner was out and running doing a great job at hosting. The staff was well prepared for the evening. My waitress qas lovely and knowledgeble. She helped explain everything on the dot and was spot on regulating the visits. I loved my sushi here, but I unfortunately do not remember any of the names. The atmosphere was quiet and they managed to get us a seat even though they were full booked. I enjoyed my time here a lot and in particular there was this one dish..(volcanic something?) whatever it was, had a really different taste to it. Good of course! Anyway yes the price is pricey but we were out on a special occasion so we knew what we were going for. Wasnt really caught in the catch much but this isnt a place for a regular lunch or dinner night out. Despite the low ratings I will agree that this may not be the best sushi in town, but do come check this place out on an event. I know I was pleased :)"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Our server, however, was clueless about the menu.   A bit overpriced also!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The service is quite good. We were seated quickly. The food was presented well, and the portions were both reasonably priced and quite filling. Pretty decent hot sake, and tempura ice cream. I'd give this place 4.5 stars overall. The only negative was that some menu items were unavailable, but the staff are very courteous and will 'go that extra mile' generally to make up for it. Great ambiance, and quite classy."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best sushi places I've been to in Montreal. The prices are a bit high but they are justifiable with their high quality food and excellent service so I recommend bringing a date here. We both loved it the place. The staff is friendly and helpful and the miso soup is delicious . Very good sushi!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. The evening started off by waiting 20 minutes for a soup and salad and the soup never made it to the table until I reminded the waitress two times that I had ordered it. We then waited 40 minutes for our main courses and had the waitress ask if we wanted to order dessert before ever being served the main course. Sushi was nothing special and can be had anywhere else in the city for less then half the price. Won't be wasting my time or money at Miso again, had better service when it was a McDonalds!!"}
{"text":"Agreablement surprise de la qualité des assiettes savoureuses et bien presentés, l'ambiance fancy et un peu froide mais la bouffe depasse le tout. Bcp de places. Creme glacé frite disponible mmmm"}
{"text":"Note to http://restaurantmiso.com/ - your t.v. Ads with the white guy & douche beard proffering a plate, and the girl with the tramp-stamp eating with her hands don't make me want your Sushi. At all.  The ostensible waitress in the ad walks up to the sushi bar, grabs a piece in her meaty fist, and shoves it down her gaping maw of a piehole.  The low-rider jeans, Tiny T and the classy Ass Antlers she is displaying which add the rich tapestry of imagery put forth in this televistic abomination, but you do get the point.  As to the Sushi, last time I checked it was OK."}
