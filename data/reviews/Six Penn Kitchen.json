{"text":"it was okay and I'm being kind about that. both me and my boyfriend didn't feel good after the meal--and that never happens to him. I felt like they are trying too hard and serving dishes that are way more complicated than need be--simplify: it would be tastier."}
{"text":"I went this place with my family including one toddler and one kid. Other restaurants were full and we just found this place.  Even though \"Not good for kids\" on the Business info of Yelp, they have kids meal and high chair! I would say this place is good for kids.  I ordered calamari and hanger steak. Both were really nice. My girl enjoyed kids cheese pizza. She gave me a bite and it was nice, too."}
{"text":"This review comes with a disclaimer: I walked in to meet some friends that were going to dine there for a bachelorette party and when I arrived, they were being kicked out. Yes, a few of them were probably a little too intoxicated to be served and I never criticize a manager for responsible serving. BUT, some of them were not drunk and the little I saw left me with the impression that the situation could have been handled better on their end. F&B managers should have the skills and finesse to handle those situations so as not to lose business, maintain the safely of their staff and guests and make the experience a winning one for all parties. I wasn't there for the whole exchange, but it sounded like they weren't willing to serve any of the party as long as they were on the (desireable) rooftop, but would serve them on another, less requested, floor. The reservation was for dinner but since the girls decided to order a bunch of appetizers and plates to share, it seemed like the catalyst was to save the table for a higher spending party. Why else would they offer to serve the group on another floor, but not on the roof?   I also got the impression that specific members of the party were called out and embarrassed in front of other guests and the rest of the girls. Like I said, I am all for responsible serving, but there is a manner in which a manager should handle such situations and it appears as though this was handled poorly. There a lot of places that people can choose to spend their money and special occasions downtown and in my opinion and experience, managers should not only prioritize their safe practice, but the experience of the guest.   That being said, I still plan to return at some point and will write a review based on that experience as well. I hope my second impression is better."}
{"text":"This was my fourth visit to Six Penn and my first with a less than satisfactory meal. My martini was good, the wedge salad was delicious but my entree and dessert were not so good. I had the Short ribs and substituted mashed potatoes for ravioli - mashed potatoes and veggies were good but the meat was very tough, not at all what you would expect for short ribs - chewy and very fatty.  For dessert I tried the chocolate truffle cake - it was very dry and tasted as if it had been around for a few days. The service was very good, our server was very attentive and friendly. My fellow diners enjoyed their entrees of trout and surf and turf (steak w/crab cake)."}
{"text":"I went to Six Penn not knowing or hearing anything about it so I didn't know what to expect. Looking at just the decor, I thought to myself, this has to be one of those classic steak house's with a menu consisting of just 7 cuts of meat and potatoes. Upon looking at the menu though, I was surprised to find classic Americana with a twist. Listing such items as meatloaf with sauerkraut bacon mashed potatoes, popcorn grits, pork chops w/apple cider soy glaze, and lobster or buffalo chicken mac and cheese. All with detailed ingredients that were a little amusing like butternut pesto cous cous, and serrano apple puree, and english peas. I always make fun of menu's like this because it's like... oh... serrano apple puree, and english peas taste much better and is more sophisticated than just apple puree and peas. I know chef's use descriptive phrases like these to liven up the menu but come on.  The ambiance and decor is sophisticated and is dressy to casual which pairs well with the upwardly mobile clientele they attract. The dining areas are dimly lit, which is very pleasant and is appointed with dark cherry wood furniture with brass accents. I was here for a private dinner party which occupied the entire upper level so I'm not quite sure if the staff was giving us special attention but the service was impeccable. And they were more than willing to accommodate the requests we had. First they allowed us to use the roof top terrace even though it was closed. The terrace is not very big but was complete with sofas and tables which was perfect for cocktails. While on the terrace it got a little chilly. So we asked if they could turn on the outdoor propane heaters and 3 employees tried unsuccessfully for about 30 min never giving up. And it wasn't until we told them it was not necessary anymore that they stopped. Now that's service!!  All in all it was an excellent dining experience. The food was great but I have to say the staff was what made it excellent, and I do recommend it to anyone who is in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times for both brunch and dinner, and I think this is a pretty solid three-star restaurant - it's not bad but nothing amazing, and consistently so.   The service has always been decent, and the food has never been bad... just never exceptional. The seasonal menu does keep things a bit new and different, but I'd also say the prices are a bit on the high end for the caliber of restaurant in this area. However, that hasn't always been the case - before there were loads of other great options in the cultural district, this place used to be my pre-theater go-to for dinner or drinks. Now, with more than a half-dozen competing restaurants within walking distance, Six Penn just doesn't stand out so much.  I think one of the biggest draws of this establishment for me now would be the rooftop dining, which provides a really nice atmosphere, provided you can get seated up there. It's one of the last unique features of this establishment that I'd be willing to pay a premium for, but with this becoming more popular in the cultural district as well, I'm not sure it will be so exclusive for long.  Overall, if you're thinking about going here, I'd say go - especially if one of the seasonal dishes catches your eye. Would also definitely recommend requesting a roof table if the weather is nice and they've available."}
{"text":"This restaurant is overpriced for what it offers. There is not a big menu selection and it oddly offers nice entrees alongside burgers and fries. It was very difficult to hear and talk to each other because the cooks in the kitchen were yelling loudly. We told our waiter and he said there was nothing he could do because it was the executive chef that was the one doing all the yelling. Several people in the restaurant were shaking their heads at the noise. Ambiance was nice. Wouldn't recommend it, you're better off going somewhere down the street for a better experience."}
{"text":"First time at 6th & Penn, went for dinner before a show at The Byham Theater... It was 16 degrees and we tried the door only to find out we were 8 minutes early before they opened. You might think that they would let you into the waiting area.. nope.. So we stopped into Olive or Twist for a pre-dinner cocktail. Came back 45 minutes later... With no reservation we were told that we could go up stairs and sit anywhere on the hardwood floor... Oh look a booth was available, so we sat down only to be told that the table was reserved. Hmmm, no sign on the table like the one on the table next to it so we chose a bistro table in the bar area. After we sat it was probably 5 minutes before our server arrived with menus/ wine list... We ordered a cheese and meat appetizer platter that was very good paired with a bottle of Washington State Merlot. It took our server 10-15 minutes to serve the wine which seemed a little excessive.   Our dinner was excellent (the lady had the Crab Cake/ seafood Hash/ I had the Rotisserie Chicken).  The manager was by to refill our wine glasses and check on us . Was hoping to get dessert but ran out of time and ask for the check from the bartender as our server seemed to disappear. Bottom line is food was excellent and service was sub par..."}
{"text":"We stopped in this evening for a beer and some to go food. It was very loud and I had trouble hearing the bartender. After sitting and waiting for 10 minutes I asked the bartender if my wife and I could have a couple beers. He was very rude and said based on my slow reaction time when we came in he would not serve either of us. I mentioned this to the hostess as we left and she offered to have me speak with her manager. I spoke with David who was a nice guy but offered little consolation for such a bad experience with this bartender. David's closing words were \"give me a call we'll do something for you.\" Not sure how sincere that comment was considering he didn't even ask my name. My wife and I have taken family on multiple occasions to the rooftop for drinks, dined there, and even had our anniversary brunch there this year. Needless to say we won't be going back anytime soon. Obviously they are doing enough business that it is not important to keep regular customers happy. We went to Olive or Twist after six penn refused to serve us and had several drinks and some food. Nice people and will definitely stop back there if in the area."}
{"text":"My overall impression... Meh. It was OK. My group ordered the pork shank, lamb bolognese, and the gumbo. I do not recommend the gumbo. It was overly salty and the seafood in it was dull flavored. The pasta had one flavor: smokey. The pork shank was decent and if I had to come here again, I would order that. The food was surprisingly unsophisticated for the fancy ingredients and prices and lacked depth of flavor. Bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"The food menu was more appetizing than the food itself. The meal was subpar expectations for how it was presented. The waitstaff was friendly, however my glass of wine was forgotten. The restaurant was half full, and she was apologetic once I reminded her. She brought the wine, and removed it from the bill. It seems to be a better happy hour place due to the location and rooftop patio."}
{"text":"Have not been here in a few years so was excited to go back.  My prior experiences were always positive.  This experience was very positive as well.  My guest enjoyed the classic pork shank...was awesome!!  Service was great but the courses doubled up to the point that we had them hold our entree...we were just finishing up the appetizer and salad.  They were very cooperative.  Atmosphere is always pleasant and overall positive experience.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"Very blah.  I came here while on a business trip so I thought I'd indulge with a bit from each section of the menu. To save you from a long review I'll highlight what I ordered, couple with my opinion.    Cesar salad - on its own a 3. Good and comes with real anchovies. I'm not a fan but can't fault them for making a quality salad.  Parmesan Fries - Tastier part of the meal and still only a 4, at best.  Almost like the pretty pig in the sty.  Pasta Primavera- my least favorite and I would rate it a 1.  Wasn't sure how one can mess up pasta but after tonight, I'll know forever.  Also, tiny serving which was fine considering how much I disliked it.   Slinged Fashion - 5 and the best part of my dining experience. Partly because of the courteous bartender that was helpful and attentive.   Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner with some co-workers recently on a Saturday and it was a good experience. The server was very helpful and attentive.    We started with a shrimp and calamari app - nothing special but it was fine.  The seafood risotto, mac and cheese and asparagus were very good.  Would not recommend the artic char.    Smaller wine and beer list.  Would recommend it if you are in PIttsburgh and looking for a nice meal that is also casual."}
{"text":"Good service but food was a pass. Too much salt in the Bolognese and the pasta was overly boiled."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Sunday brunch at Six Penn Kitchen and I was very dissapointed. I ordered the corned beef hash skillet with over easy eggs and whole grain mustard hollaindaise. I never got anything whole grain mustard hollaindaise. It makes me mad that I didn't realize this until we were on our way out the door. And my friend ordered eggs benedict which was supposed to come with ham and spinach- never got any ham or spinach. We got ripped off. Anyway,back to the hash skillet. The skillet was taken directly out of a volcano oven. I tried stirring it and blowing on it- but it was so hot I could not eat anything for  15 minutes. And this is mid July. Not exactly a good menu item for the season. There was very little egg or corned beef. It was almost entirely potatoes.  Lastly, our waiter was not very enthusiastic about working there. I just don't think it is right to go from table to table saying how big of a drag it is to be stuck working Sunday morning."}
{"text":"The place looked interesting so we thought we would give it a try.  The host was not very accommodating and when I asked for the patio he told us it was first come first serve and it was on the third floor.  he didn't tell us it was packed and there were no seats.  We returned and we were seated in a very nice corner booth.  Our waitress, Anna, was very nice and gave us plenty of information about the menu items.  I ordered a light beer was served a regular Yuengling?  I ordered lemon mashed potatoes and was served bacon sauerkraut mashed potatoes?  I don't think I have mentioned yet that the floors were sticky, really? sticky floors?  The final complaint is this, after we ordered, our food arrived in about 2 minutes.  I thought the server was making a mistake and told him it wasn't ours, it was.  I had not even had a chance to enjoy the wrong beer I was served earlier.  If I want my food in two minutes, I can go to McDonalds.  Now the reason this place received two stars instead of zero, the food was very tasty!  If the floors had not been sticky and my order would have been correct this would be a higher rating."}
{"text":"I had the chicken wings first time there and it was pretty good but very sticky. I also had gluten free pizza few times and sometimes it was good and sometimes it gave me reaction.  I had the mussels last night and it was awful and made me sick that night and next day.  Husband ordered scallops and it was two quarter size scallops for $15 and it was cold like it was sitting around for awhile. It's great location and wanted to like it but just does not cut it for me and I don't think can give another chance after last night and that awful mussels I ever had."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overflavored, and the menu is all over the place. The $16 hamburger for example, attempts gourmet, but is really just a regular burger on top of a big hunk of cornbread, with ham, pulled pork, bbq sauce on it and a pile of coleslaw... nothing special about any of it. It's open faced - since when does that count as a burger? Overall it seems like they are just trying too hard. The falafel didn't taste like any falafel I've ever had and the flavors of the whole dish were too intense and too contradictory. Not worth it. Roof deck is nice- go for drinks go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Great choice for a late night dinner when downtown. We each ordered a salad and shared an appetizer and it was more than enough food.  It also gave us the opportunity to enjoy a great dessert! Nice wine list too!"}
{"text":"Ambiance, classy? Doubtful. Food was delicious but service was awful. Bartender told us we needed to be quiet and we're disturbing people...there was literally no one next to us. We were there for 3 birthday's at once and spent so much $$ on food and drinks. Immediately ruined the vibe, doucheb's. It's Friday night and we're at the bar, get off your high horse."}
{"text":"Went with a large party for a birthday. Would not recommend going with a party larger than 4. Food was good but over priced. Waited 20 minutes for bottled beer every time we ordered another round. Was told that we could do separate checks when placing the reservation and ended up with pen and paper splitting the check ourselves between 14 people. As far as the service, should of just had Eat n' Park on the front of the building."}
{"text":"Overall an ok place with the location being better than the food. The prices are way too high to justify the food which tells me this is a tourist trap. I would recommend Meat and potatoes just down the street before sitting down for dinner here."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food and the ambiance of Six Penn. The limited menu is nice some times, and other times I wish they had standard fare. Great place for drinks and the food is usually quite good. Pricy, yes, but that is the point of the place I think."}
{"text":"Why dine when you can nibble?   Six Penn is by the theaters. They're hoping you're a visiting tourist. You're too tired to walk to the strip. Let's face it, this place has location location location, hence the hefty price tag ($16-$33 per entree) and swanky decor. That being said, they've also got some pretty good grinds for the average Joe in jeans and a leather jacket.   The upstairs roof bar had $5-$7 appetizers and drink specials, but the food was downsized and focused on the greasy (think tempura fried mini hot dogs) Do we really need to make pigs in a blanket sound fancy schmancy? Can't we just give into guilty pleasure and enjoy?   Instead, sit with the suits and do like we did:   Share a salad - No cost to split the beet and goat cheese salad with balsamic reduction. Watch out for the red peppercorns mixed in with the goat cheese - these could use a finer grind.   Have a daily soup - $5 for a good sized bowl of sweet potato soup. Great spice, drizzled with creme fresh and chives. Almost tasted like it had some peanuts in it. Definitely the highpoint of the evening.   Get more bread - their garlic foccacia is really garlicky!!! Who needs butter? Well maybe just a little bit :)   Order up some sides - We had the soft pretzels which had a little herb, rock salt and Parmesan to set off the whole seed mustard. Yummy. We also tried the homemade kim chee, but this came surprising mixed with brown rice. This is not Hawaii style kim chee fried rice, but kim chee mixed with rice. Bleh. The kim chee would have been better served alone, it has a nice sour flavor (not authentic) but also packs some heat which I like. Mac n. cheese was OK. Baked on top and saucy on the bottom. Not for mac n' cheese purists. Asparagus with Parmesan was just over cooked, but I blame the waiter who left our food on the line for over 10 minutes.   Under $20 a head and couldn't finish everything on the table. Overall, our experience was mixed. Some menu items are really inventive like the buffalo chicken mac n' cheese with Gorgonzola and the burger on cornbread bun with cilantro mayo and a grilled chili. But based on what we ordered and other yelpers, I bet they can be hit or miss. Our neighbors had the pizza appetizer (small) and didn't hardly touch their calamari.   Better advice - go for a drink, order something to nibble, enjoy some swank time in the city and grab a burger on the way home."}
{"text":"We stopped b y Six Penn Kitchen last night after a long day around the city, and am very glad that we did.   The food was superb, the atmosphere classy yet welcoming."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh on business and randomly came across and add for Six Penn Kitchen. Was totally surprised by the warm and lively atmosphere. The sweetbread appetizer is one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. Shared the lobster mac and cheese entree after a filling appetizer. Everything was rich, filling, and unique. Great meal, great service ... the lobster mac and cheese is a must!"}
{"text":"Been there with the love of my life! Marvelous food, perfect personal service. Good prices. Recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Since my wife and I are vegetarians, I was hesitant to go here since there is only 1 vegetarian entree on the dinner menu (falafel).  However, their menu encouraged guests to ask the server about vegetarian options, implying that you could get something nice that wasn't on the menu. So I asked our server (possibly the most unpleasant waitress I've ever encountered in a nice restaurant) about the vegetarian options.  She said \"the falafel\".  Um--yeah, I can read.  So I asked nicely if there was any other vegetarian dish the chef would enjoy preparing that wasn't listed on the menu.  She said \"we could do some kind of pasta or something.\"  Oooh--sounds delicious.   So I went with a salad and my wife got the falafel.  In fairness, the falafel was really good.  Also, the drinks were great. And since there wasn't much to eat, the bourbon in my drink was much more effective than if I had a full stomach."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying the day that i did go to Six Penn, the Pirates were in town and the filming of the Batman movie was taking place down the street.  That being said I don't care how busy you are, I am paying my money and expect great service.  The bf and I were soo hungry from walking around all day, that we ordered appetizers we usually don't because we get too full.  We ordered the fried green tomatoes caprese salad, Blahh that's the sound of me throwing up in my mouth.   It was horrible, it tasted as if the tomatoes had been rolled in old frosted flakes and then left to dry on its own.   The cheese ehh do yourself a favor and stay away from it, who would've thought that you can go wrong with tomatoes and cheese ??? Really Six Penn Really??? I was in the mood for steak and so was the bf.   We both ordered the grilled rib eye .Maybe it was my hunger but I thought it was ok.  Then again you can never go wrong with potatoes and meat can you???  Of course there is a downside the rib eye had too much fat.  I ordered mine with jalapeno corn tapioca and this was the only thing I found delish.  The reason why I gave it two stars was because the drinks are soft, service was horrible and lets not forget the disgusting appetizer.  I could've taken my hundred dollars and gone to Outback's( i usually don't go I hate chain restaurants) and I would've been happier ."}
{"text":"Very nice place, echo the other reviews. Wine list was surprisingly decent with a nice selection and not overly priced. The cracklin' pork shank was great as were many of the appetizers (chicken wings, Calamari, and Crab dip). Service was good as were the surroundings."}
{"text":"I visited here with a friend when I was recently in Pittsburgh.  Yum!  We went for brunch.  I started with the mini eclairs (not the name on the menu... can't remember the actual name).  They were warm and DELICIOUS!!  For my meal, I had their meat omelet.  It was quite tasty and stuffed to the gills.  Oh Six Penn, it's lucky I don't live in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic night here, the other night. The gnocchi were outstanding, and Shirley, our waitress was so gracious and helpful when we had requests. We loved the food and the service. The key lime pie was delicious. They packed up a circus dessert (the doughnuts...) so nicely for me to bring home to my son, as well. Just loved it."}
{"text":"For all the hype, I wasn't impressed. The food was good, but I thought the prices were high for what you get. I would try it again though, to see if my mind changes."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Six Penn last night. Walked right in and we were able to get seated with no reservation. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  A nice atmosphere without being stuffy in any way.   I started with a drink which I believe was named Caramel Apple. It was delicious.  It pretty much tasted like apple pie. Highly recommend if you do not really like tasting alcohol.  I ordered the Buffalo Mac and Cheese. It was delicious. A decent portion size. I was full and still had left overs.  I will be sure to return to Six Penn again. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A little too sports-bar-ish for my taste (I thought it was a chain from outside), with only decent service, but a great menu. I had the red maple pear salad and it was small for the price but near-perfect."}
{"text":"Yummy brunch pumpkin French toast to die for! Potato  home fries were delicious garden omelet just okay   Our server Tim super friendly and a good waiter We will come back"}
{"text":"Save yourself the money you would spend here and just go to eat n park. Same food, but at least it's buffet style."}
{"text":"We picked the restaurant because it was close to our hotel and the ballpark. Did use online reservation to get seated as we had tickets to the game. Showed up early, was seated right a way. Waiter was on his game. Prompt and friendly service. Found the menu to have a wide variety. Also the choices and compensations were very well put together. Wife had trout with pasta, I had the pork with potatoes and cabbage.  I cleaned my plate. The wife would if she could. The meals were delightful. It was our first trip to Pittsburgh.  We have this restraurant on our return list."}
{"text":"I took a client there for a big dinner meeting.  I ordered the $33 special salmon and it was served 80% raw.  When I sent it back it came back so overcooked it was white.  The service was terrible as we had to flag down our waiter for everything."}
{"text":"Alright food but just not worth the price. $25 for a small portion that lacked flavor and didn't fill me up (Parmesan gnocchi). Kind waitstaff and great location but the ambiance definitely lacked. All around probably wouldn't go back. They did have a wonderful honey on their antipasti board though."}
{"text":"I would give Six Penn a 3.5 if I could.  Went here immediately after Eleven so am comparing it to that.  The place (on a Thursday evening) was packed, then everyone cleared out right about the time the local theater was starting up.    The menu has some interesting items and all were quite good (buffalo mac and cheese was very creamy but also quite salty/rich.  Pork shanks and pork chops were nice and juicy.  The service was interesting - tried to subtly upsell us on the soups and salads (not included.)    Overall a solid option particularly if you're downtown for a show but be prepared to pay for it.  On a side note, they have a dessert that appears to be a tower of cotton candy on top of whoopie pies - this kept appearing on all the tables around us."}
{"text":"Good buffalo mac & cheese, monte cristo, and po boys. Nice beer selection, big seating area, clean, and awesome rooftop bar when open. Overall not a bad downtown spot."}
{"text":"Too bad, too noisy, too scattered.  Not to sound \"high brow\" (adjusting my clunky, yet attractive eyeglasses) but the menu was bulky with food made with one or too many unique ingredients.  Simplifying would help.  Also we had reservations before the theater (seriously, but hardly artsy elitist) and by time we had our entrees, the noise made in near to impossibe to chat.   I read that some found the staff tough to deal with.  Our server was good (although for some strange reason she introduced 3 times).  However, the hostess seemed to lack that welcoming, first impression that is needed in a restaurant.   Probably won't be returning.  Didn't find reasons to give SixPenn Kitchen a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"I was invited here for a work dinner. The good: The service is prompt and friendly. They were attentive to a large party. The crab cake appetizer was delicious, as were the short rib meatballs. The bad: Everything else. The wine was sour, the food flavorless, dry, and bland. I'm honestly not sure I'd eat here again. I'm hoping this is due to them fixing our food family style in large quantities. The space is beautiful and large, which is great for larger parties."}
{"text":"Key word = wait. 45 mins for a table, decided to eat at the bar as a seat opened up after 30 mins. Bartender immediately came over and took our drink order and brought them right back. That was the last I saw of her. 30 mins later, I went to the bar and asked for a menu, 25 mins later we decided to leave as no server came to take our order. Paid for our drinks at the bar and left. I would not recommend based on service alone."}
{"text":"LOUD LOUD LOUD LOUD LOUD. I read through a bunch of other reviews and quite frankly I'm shocked that I didn't see this mentioned. The food is great. It's delicious. I have absolutely no complaints about the food but the acoustics in this place are just awful. I could barely hear the people that were with me at my table. This is not based on one visit, I've been to Six Penn several times.  It's uncomfortably loud in there. They really need to do something about this.  Again, great food though."}
{"text":"I frequent Six Penn Kitchen often and everything I have ordered was wonderful.   Most recently I was in for Date night with my husband. We had a nice Two seat table in the second floor by the bar. In was nice and intimate, great view out onto 6th street plus right next to the bartenders!!!   Service was 5 stars and they were quite busy. We went around 6 pm on a Wednesday evening and the bar area around us was full. The bartenders who were serving us were on top of everything!   We ordered the calamari as our app. It was great the aioli is very good. We also had the French onion soup that was really good.   I ordered the Shrimp étouffée and it is different than any other étouffée I have ever had before. It was AWESOME!!! 6 big Shrimp and \"popcorn\" grits all I can say is YUM!!!   My husband ordered the Steak which he was very happy with. I did not try it because he orders his steaks rare. But, he was happy and we cleaned our plates!   We also ordered dessert. I had the Apple Pie which was really good and the crust reminds me of my grandmothers pie crust. Nice and buttery! My husband had the German Chocolate Pudding. You think well it's pudding? But this pudding was no jello it was terrific, nice and rich with coconut and nuts mixed in and the whipped cream on top was very tasty.   It was another wonderful experience at Six Penn Kitchen. The food is always awesome and so is the service!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Six Penn Kitchen five or six times and always had a good experience.  Yesterday was our first brunch and we were very satisfied.  My wife requires gluten free and they have GF items.  Unfortunately with the Keystone breakfast (eggs, sausage, bacon, home fries & toast), she had to forego both the home fries and the toast.  Seems like you could make up some gluten free home fries.  But she said the eggs, sausage and bacon were excellent.  The Monte Cristo was also very good.  The tea and coffee were served in pre-heated cups which helps keep the beverage warm longer.  We wouldn't make a special trip downtown to eat there but it has been a dependable place to eat when going to concerts and other downtown functions.  We've always had good service even when it has been busy.  This restaurant is in the heart of the cultural district and can get very busy, so you may was to make Open Table reservations."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here after seeing a show at Heinz Hall last night. We both ordered the boars sausage spaghetti. The dishes were $26 each. We both couldn't believe how small the portions were. Definitely overpriced, the place was extremely noisy for 10:30 pm, and the server was not very friendly. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the pork shank and ate the whole thing. Too bad for my waist line but excellent choice for my belly! it could have fed two and fell off the bone. Delicious."}
{"text":"Food was middle of the road. Pretzel bite appetizer wasn't pretzel but was pizza dough. Calamari and shrimp appetizer was good. I had the NY strip and ordered it medium. It didn't come medium however, the flavor was great. Potatoes and asparagus with it were delicious.  We sat on the rooftop and it was nice. Not rushing back anytime soon. Just okay."}
{"text":"Food is okay, though service is not. We have been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Waited forever for service both times and it wasn't that busy.  I had \"Miso glazed tofu, wild mushroom ginger lemongrass ragout; mushroom consomme\" appetizer, which was pretty much the only vegetarian choice, and it was good, though nothing I couldn't make at home. My dinner, \"Homemade goat cheese citrus ravioli, Jersey beets, apples; pepper crme fraiche\" was also good, though the beets didn't quite do it for me.  Dessert was a bread pudding, which was a bit dry.  It is not an expensive dinner out, so that took some of the sting off the miserable service."}
{"text":"Some key takeaways from our meal last night:  - Though we called 2 weeks in advance to make the reservation we had to wait 25 minutes upon arrival for our table.  - While we waited went up to the rooftop to get a drink, the rooftop was very crowded.  - Our meal took 45 minutes to come out after our appetizers were finished.  - The portions were quite small, around 50% of the portion size of similar restaurants.  - The entrees were overpriced by about 25%, most in the high 20's and 30's.  - We called ahead of time to have desserts brought out for someone's birthday in our party, and these were never brought out.  - The restaurant was very cold inside, and very dark, with minimal lighting at our table.  - They did not have candles for the birthday cake.   Overall, though the food was good and it was a very nice restaurant, the service was unacceptable for this caliber of a restaurant. We definitely expected more, and have even dined here in the past, which was a much better experience. The food was very flavorful and nicely prepared, despite the portions being small. Service needs to be improved upon."}
{"text":"I just paid for (and ate) the worst meal ever. Seriously, hubby and I are here for a bite to kill time before we pick up a piece of jewelry being sized. He ordered a Mediterranean tuna wrap and liked it. I ordered a Caesar salad with grilled shrimp. Honestly, we could not have timed it worse if we tried. The lunch rush is over, absolutely nobody here except us and another table. Our waiter is doing his end of shift duties to get out of here, and the kitchen is cleaning after the rush. They are super noisy!!  Anyway, they made my salad, and I saw it sitting at the window for what seemed to be 30 minutes (probably abt 15) as our waiter was nowhere to be seen.  When it came the shrimp were so dry I almost choked. No waiter ever came back to check, no manager around, no hostess. Terribly disappointed with the meal and the service."}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch. The brunch was mediocre at best. The huevos rancheros were tasteless. The clientele was much older than expected. I've been to Six Penn Kitchen for drinks and was happy. Brunch was just disappointing. Stick to Big Burrito or other little guys... Six Penn is only good for drinks."}
{"text":"I recently moved here from Chicago so I'm still adjusting but I didn't like the food at all. My boyfriend and I went for brunch and wanted to sit on the rooftop. My breakfast sausage was not editable.. it tasted like old meat. After eating that as an appetizer I was turned off so I just stuck with my beverage. The staff was really nice and the rooftop was great as well."}
{"text":"I went here last month with a girlfriend to grab a drink and some appetizers before a show. I had their Watermelon Margarita which was super refreshing and highly addictive. For appetizers, we ordered wings and pretzel bites and they were pretty good. All in all, a great place to stop in before seeing a show in Downtown Pittsburgh  - ambiance is good and service is great."}
{"text":"This restaurant was splendid across the entire spectrum. As a trendy place to enjoy lunch on any day, the service was superb and the meal was even better.  I had the \"buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese\" and it was fantastic! You could really sit and read the menu for hours as each item sounds just absolutely wonderful. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Ok, what can I say about sixx Penn except freakin awesome. The flash fried calamari and rock shrimp never disappoint and the smoked chicken wing are pretty good with a hint of spiciness. Overall ambiance is nice and it gets pretty lively. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Six Penn Kitchen used to be a regular hang for the boyfriend and I when we lived downtown a few years ago -- but once it wasn't down the street, I mostly forgot about it. Until a couple months ago when researching gluten-free restaurant options, this once again became a mainstay on our dining list. (And we've already been back a few times -- mostly for the french onion soup!)  There are SEVERAL options for gluten-free identified on the regular menu, and their kitchen is incredible with making additional substitutions when asked. On one visit I had their pizza (made with cauliflower crust) and a mix of seasonal vegetables (I can't have tomato sauce either, so they made a wonderful white pizza for me). On another visit, I had their duck breast entree, served with a lovely lentil puree and roasted vegetables (they even gave me more to make up for having to leave off some kind of crostini). I can't believe I'm admitting this, but I snagged a bite of the boyfriend's beet salad and LOVED it (and I am a fervent beet hater). And then the server recommended a \"gluten-free\" version of their apple pie (basically the pie's most delicious part -- the center) with some ice cream. This lady speaks right to my heart!  I am infinitely impressed with the service (several managers also checked in on us to ensure our meal was excellent), their unwavering (and uncomplicated) support of people with diet restrictions, and the food. Six Penn is doing so many things right, and they make \"eating like a normal person\" too easy (I also suggest grabbing a table near the kitchen to hear the chef and his crew at work!).   YES, CHEF... SIX STARS!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, I would recommend it to everyone. I took a guest here for a special occasion and we had a horrible experience. My guest ordered the ravioli. Once the meal arrived, his plate consisted of 6 small ravioli. No side of veggies. We ended up sharing my meal. The waiter didn't recommend getting a side salad or cup of soup. We had no warning that the $30 plate was enough for a toddler. I was so embarrassed! I emailed the restaurant twice. I have yet to hear back from anyone about the experience. I will never go back nor will I recommend anyone to go there. If you have horrible customer service and don't try to make it right so that the customer will come back, I'm not interested."}
{"text":"I went with some colleagues for happy hour on the roof top of Six Penn Kitchen. Shockingly, in my entire career this was my first happy hour, and after yesterday at Six Penn it could be my last. Maybe not. So keep in mind that his is a review of happy hour there, not the restaurant.  I am not old, but I will sound old right here. The atmosphere of young \"professionals\" was shit! The crowd that was attracted to this location was an embarrassment for working professionals everywhere. I know that this is not Six Penn's fault, but this is a warning to those who wish to stay away from the douchebaggery. Beyond the clientele at the happy hour the prices were crazy! Not so happy of an hour at all. I could maybe understand charging more downstairs because of the ambiance, but we were up stairs on a deck for happy hour. Adjust accordingly! Lastly was the spacing. I know you need to work with what you got so here is a tip...get there early for a half decent seat on the rooftop. Otherwise you're screwed.   So, pricing was not realistic for the time or atmosphere. The environment of people was not enjoyable, but laughable. However there was one saving grace there. See the taste review below.  Here is the 5 senses review: (1-10)  Sight: 7 - decent views of the buildings in downtown Smell: 2 - nothing to really report this was just happy hour after all.  Hearing: 2 - bring down the music a pinch. hearing your friends was difficult with the volume of people. Taste: 8 - the one saving grace to distract from the pricing, the \"Almost Arnie\" drink!!! Amazing!!! Iced tea and limoncello with mint leaves. Touch: 0 - nothing to report home about."}
{"text":"If you want to be insulted by your waiter--eat here!  We took my bf's parents before a ball game for a quick bite to eat.  His mom and I both got the flat bread, her's was CHARRED black on the bottom and tasted of it, too.  She ate one piece of hers and after that she and I split mine.  We didn't have time to wait for another one.  When we showed our waiter---he acted like because she ate one piece she was lying!  \"Did you like it? Did it taste good?  You ate it!\"  Ummmm...how about she was hungry and expecting her meal not to be charred, butthead.  Needless to say, that totally ruined any chances of us returning."}
{"text":"The food is bomb.com and the service is awesome. Very calm and lively atmosphere. They have like two floors and a rooftop you can chose to eat at. The lamb is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Recently visited Pittsburgh for a leadership conference and was told by my fellow conferees about this place.  So we trotted back for dinner to discover that we needed reservations.  We chose to sit at the bar and order...luckily a near by table opened up and the four of us moved over.  We started with cocktails and needless to say that the white sangria was wonderful!!!   We ordered our separate entrees; one of us ordered a salad and the famous mac and cheese(very good), one of us ordered the special, one of us ordered the lamb shank(so tender it fell off the bone and was well seasoned), and I ordered the jerk chicken with a plantain mash and corn on the cob.  What I expected for the plantain mash was that the plantain would be mashed like potatoes.  It was not the case...which slightly disappointed me.  It was actually mashed potatoes with bits of plantain and bacon.  It was tasty.  We each took a bite of each dish to discover that everything was very good.   We finished what we could and decided to share dessert.  We had the marscapone cheesecake with a ring of white chocolate around it .  It did not disappoint.  I gave this place a three because the service, was rather slow.  Since we were at the bar, we had the bartenders also as wait staff.  Next time, if I am ever in Pittsburgh, I will make sure reservations are made!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this cultural district restaurant.  The portions were miniscule, overpriced, and of poor quality.  The quail was tough and the \"Seafood Risotto\" consisted of 2 mussels, 2 small clams, a small, unidentifiable piece of fish served over a spoonful of too-salty risotto for $27!  There was no attempt at attractive presentation.  We left hungry with a $100 check.  It put a damper on the entire evening.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great first dinner spot! The food is amazing! Don't miss this place! Courtesy wait staff and great all around service!"}
{"text":"Six Penn Kitchen was just okay. I now know why I didn't need a reservation.  We had no problems with service, but the food was mediocre and very overpriced.  The menu is impressive, but the food disappoints. I got the Eggs Benedict. It was room temperature and average quality. It thought it would be delicious since it was made with a crab cake. However, I was wrong.  My friend got the breakfast sliders, which were cold. The bacon was chewy and fatty. We each got a blood mary. Those were okay, but again, nothing special. For a $60 bruch, I would expect a lot better. I wouldn't recommend Six Penn and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I would love to glow about Six Penn's brunch.  I love the design of the space and its location.  At the same time, I can't stop thinking Eat and Park--because it is part of the same Parkhurst family of restaurants.  So with that said:   A waffle is a waffle and not worth $14 even with Mexican chocolate creme anglaise (chocolate pudding) and warmed spiced syrup (I tasted no spice)..  And local sausage tastes just like sausage--and not worth $4 for 2 links.  My companion ordered a tomato juice and a breakfast sandwich w/o bacon for health reasons.  So she had an egg and cheese sandwich on white toast with home fries (which did look great).  But she ordered a tomato juice and got a glass of bloody mary mix.  The server should have been upfront and told her they used all of their tomato juice in bloody mix as she was embarassed to return it.  Finally, the service:  we did not lift fork to mouth before he was back to the table to see how the food was.  But to get the check?  Not so easy.  A little problem since even the greeter knew we had a 2 PM curtain and told us so when she seated us.  Sorry Six Penn--next time we'll just to to Eat and Park and catch a cocktail downtown later.  4 stars for pretention, 1 star for reality."}
{"text":"We dined there Saturday night and found it quite unremarkable. The food came out fast but our strip steak and pork shank was a bit dry and over done. Sides, again , nondescript.  If you go, get a booth as the tables facing the cooking area are small and placed near a multiparty table. It was quite noisy. We wanted to try Six Penn before it closed, but after experiencing their fare and ambiance, I don't think we missed much in not going sooner."}
{"text":"Gosh I so wanted to LOVE this. But alas, not quite. We were there during the Sunday Brunch period, and it was not terribly busy; we walked in with no reservations and were seated immediately.  Our waiter was friendly and seemed attentive.  BUT I ordered eggs sunnyside up with whole wheat toast and got over easy eggs with sourdough.  Both of those were tasty, so it wasn't awful.  When the delivery-server brought the meals, she said, inquiringly \"eggs over easy?\" (Don't they know who ordered what?  There were two people at our table, one male one female.  Seems they would have noted it.  But maybe not, and really not a big deal.)  I said \"I ordered sunnyside up...\" she said \"it says over easy! do you want me to have it re-done?\"  I hate this dilemma.  I can take what is in front of me, which looks pretty good, or I can wait for a new plate while my dining partner eats.  Then I can eat alone when my plate arrives. Not ideal.  I decided to keep the over easy eggs, which were quite runny, as I like them, so were fine.  The server reported to our waiter, who came to the table and said he was getting the sunnyside up.  I pointed to the toast and asked if it was wheat or sourdough.  He said \"it's sourdough.... did you prefer wheat?\"  (YES that's why I ordered wheat, I thought to myself).  I said (nicely!!)  \"yes, that's what I ordered.\"  He said he would get the wheat toast.  We tried to convince him NOT to redo the eggs, as I would be done eating by the time they arrived. And I was.   But he insisted. I think, really, he didn't know what else to do.  And that's not his fault; it's poor training.  Another gentleman (not a server, not a waiter... maybe a manager but he didn't identify himself)  brought the eggs and asked \"did someone here order sunnyside up eggs?\"  We let him leave them, and then I ATE most of them because I hate to let food go to waste. It was more food than I needed, but that's my fault for eating it.  Along the way, NO ONE ever apologized.  NO ONE.  Really it was no big deal, but a sincere \"I'm really sorry your order was not correct\" would have been nice.  Instead we got food brought AFTER I was nearly done eating.  So yes, they corrected the error.  But not in a way that was satisfying to ME, the customer.  2 cups of coffee, on the house, would have been a pleasing end to the meal, and a much nicer gesture than more food that we really didn't need.  Oh, and the bacon was less-than-satisfying.  Kind of like the grill needed to be cleaned.  Not a smoky, rich bacon like I had hoped for. But maybe that's standard for their bacon. I WANTED to love it.  But I did not.  I hope they think about how best to handle errors such as this, in a way that thinks about the needs of their diners, not just \"redoing to make it right.\""}
{"text":"While the food was really tasty, the service absolutely sucked. If you want to run with the big dogs, and charge the big dog prices, you've got to have the service that goes with it.  I think we saw the waitress exactly three times during the course of the dinner.  She said she'd bring us bread, and then didn't.  She was slow on the drink service (note: we would have bought more if you came more often, making both the server AND the restaurant more money)  I'm borderline 3/4 stars on this one because the food was great, but the service was bad.  It was expensive ($112 after tax, before tip, including 4 cocktails) and SPK just has to do a better job at that price point if they want better reviews.  The scallops appetizer was great, the salad had way too many onions, the Buffalo Chicken Mac n Cheese($18) was good but DRY, the braised short ribs were excellent.  The cocktails were fine, but they were also small.  Anytime the service is getting in the way with of a good conversation and BECOMES THE TOPIC of conversation, then you know that it needs improving.  Overall, it could have been a better experience."}
{"text":"Six Penn has a great little rooftop lounge where you can eat, have drinks or just hangout.  Awesome view of beautiful downtown Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"An upscale experiment from the Eat N Park Executives this cultural district hot spot is a delicious and more affordable option then other places downtown. If your looking for a nice night out without breaking the bank head here. Six Penn brings some of the best local farms has to offer to your table. Try the Jameson Farms Lamb Bolognese. Also try their signature Pork Shank. The service could be more consistent though."}
{"text":"The price is steep, but those braised beef gnocchi are fabulous. Great for a special occasion celebration or date night."}
{"text":"My first visit to Six Penn was a few weeks ago, taking a colleague out for lunch to celebrate his move to a new and better job. It was a perfect place for such an occasion and the ambiance and design of the restaurant was upscale but relaxed.   On the menu, vegetarian items are marked well and I found the server to be knowledgeable and helpful in providing information about ingredients and options. I ordered a falafel sandwich and while not totally traditional, it was made in-house and was delicious. The ingredients were very fresh and the dish was not overwrought. The service was quick and attentive and our food was out quickly, though I might not recommend attempting a work lunch if you don't have at least 30-45 minutes available.  I am excited to try their food again, perhaps this time to see what good items they have on their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Great food--great service--nice ambience.  I had the crab cake sandwich--which I had never heard of putting crab cakes on a sandwich?  But it was really good.  And the crab cakes were CRAB cakes and not crab CAKES.  Very little breading/filling.  The bread was good.  Can't remember what the hubs had (it was two weeks ago....) but he liked it.  Great service--we were on the main floor about noon on a weekday, and the sun was pouring into the upper windows.  I was squinting big time--someone must have noticed, the shades came down, voila!  No more squinting.  Ambience was nice--business-y.  Everyone but us in biz casual or full biz suits.  That's OK--reminded me of my banking life before retiring.....we weren't slobs--dressed in shorts and golf shirts, basically--and still felt welcome.  When we return to Pittsburgh, we'll come back."}
{"text":"The menu is not for the faint hearted (ex. Boar sausage, pork belly, etc.)  We had reservations and were promptly seated.  Today was the first day of the new menu.  The waitstaff had tried it the previous day.  We ordered the French onion soup - mediocre.  The soup of the day pork bean vegetable was enjoyable.  For dinner, we had the steak, chicken salad and artic char.  The bread was almost Town Talk. The dipping oil was infused with fresh basil was very good.  The steak could have been warmer but the asparagus were good.  The artic char was described as being in the salmon family ... fishy with lukewarm quinoa.  The micro green salad with the salmon was excellent. The chicken salad too much salad dressing.  After reading all the great reviews, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I had chicken wings for appetizer, to be honest it was totally tasteless, salad was also not appetizing as well. I believe the dinner menu is overpriced."}
{"text":"Enjoyable evening at Six Penn! The drinks were great and wait staff great. We sat facing the kitchen, and it was actually very entertaining watching how hard the staff works. My friend had their pizza off the starters menu for her meal, and it was one of the best pizzas I've had. I had the roasted chicken, and it was good, but not for the money I paid.  Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for the dining room but ended up on the roof for dinner instead.  What a great ambiance for people watching from above!  Dinner consisted of appetizers and they were all great.  I highly recommend the scallops and buffalo mac and cheese.  All excellent choices.  Service was outstanding.  A good time was had by all.  They were also very accommodating to my vegetarian daughter in law."}
{"text":"Went there for our anniversary and had the crackling pork shank with the kraut mashed potatoes- it was flipping divine! Only thing better was the super bomb bartender Jess (yes, I'm naming names) who took such great care of us we ended up eating at the bar. Perfect evening- perfect meal."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience at Six Penn.  The food is consistent and the staff is very friendly.  As a downtown resident, I go here often and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Six Penn Kitchen during a yelp event. The host was very gracious and personable, discussing each dish and wine pairing at length prior to each course.  My favorite dish of the evening by far was the ahi tuna with eggs, avocado and endive, a delightful play on Nicole's salad.  The tuna was prepared beautifully, had just the right texture and taste, strategically paired with the Pinot Gris. I also really enjoyed the lamb with lentils and pomegranate jus. The flavors on the dish complimented each other well and the taste of the meat was excellent. Before we went home, the staff provided us with house made chocolate mints, the perfect end to a fabulous meal.  I highly recommend dinning at this place for the food and impeccable service!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Everything looked right when we went in, then unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. I had two associates with me, and for starters, they each ordered a glass of wine, I ordered a whiskey. When the wine came, one wine glass was filthy, the other cracked. They replaced those.   For dinner, I ordered the burger, someone ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese, the other ordered the salmon. My burger tasted fine, but at the very moment the hostess came by to see how we were doing, I pulled an 11\" hair out of my burger. She offered to replace the burger and take it off the meal, but I still think that went a little short. I passed on another burger and thanked her.  The next morning, my associate who had ordered the salmon informed us that she had been up all night sick.  I'm sorry to say, it might have just been a perfect storm of bad luck on the restaurant's part, but I can't go back.  If you go, it has the potential to be really good. It just wasn't on our night."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Brunch is a must! Will definitely be back. More on the classier upscale side, but worth it. I suggest making reservations first, but line is never too long. Order the beignets!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with some friends.  Love the location in the city and the ambiance.  However, the food is just ok.  Don't get me wrong, it's decent, but it didn't \"wow\" me.  The prices are pretty high for what you get in my opinion.  I wouldn't write this place off and I'd be willing to try it again, but so far, it was just \"so-so\"."}
{"text":"This is stupid place to spend your evening at. the food is shitt..no no it is really shit. They serve $34 NY Strip which tastes the same as the eatin park meatloaf meal. The servers were rude did not even pack our food.  I am also pretty sure they keep all the leftover from a table together after the waiters pick them up and serve to a different table if they ask for the same snacks or sides. It is pathetic that even after having such a prime location they are useless"}
{"text":"My hubs and I joined another couple for NYE dinner.  They had a special NYE menu which we looked up online ahead of time and the options looked terrific (filet and lobster tail, blackened catfish, seared tuna, and crab cakes).  The regular menu was also an option.  I ordered a small house salad which was ok, not much to it just lettuce and dressing blah...for dinner I opted for the seared tuna- terrible!!  I asked the waitress which item was the best on the special NYE menu and she recommended stk and lobster so I thought maybe I ordered wrong?  NOPE!  My friend ordered it and it was pure salt.  Rather gross and not edible and I like salt but this was insane...expensive, waitress who cared less, bad food...it leaves me upset that we came here.  My dish was stringy- the seared tuna...it came w sushi rice that was crunchy.  Just not good!    The bill between 4 of us was $220.  I'm still pissed!"}
{"text":"Small menu (was there at 3pm perhaps they have a separate dinner menu?) ordered the wings, the sauce was awesome but the quality of the wings was just okay. Small drink menu and only 5 draft choices. Comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Would be so much better if a) the rooftop was bigger and b) it wasn't so darn expensive... How about some better happy hour specials?"}
{"text":"The staff was great from the time I walked in to the time I left. My food came out in a timely manner. I ordered the pretzels for the app the Mac and cheese for main course and the sex on the beach sorbe for dessert.  The bill was around 30 bucks. Which is not bad for good food in my opinion.  My food opinion: the pretzels were amazing they were freshly cooked and made in the restaurant. They had just enough flavor to them. You get get 2 with your order.   The buffalo Mac and cheese was no where near what I expected. It was way to rich for me. The taste that you would have to be ready for. Don't get me wrong I love chicken and Mac and cheese, but this dish was so drowned in the sauce my stomach was not having it. I took like 3 bites and was done.  I had to also search for the chicken I swear it seem to only have like four little pieces of chicken in it. The sorbe was great, you taste the hint of alcohol in it.  it actually taste like the real drink sex on the beach.  I gave this venue a 3 because for the price it was not what i expected and i have had better. it is well over priced"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place..... my bf and i had planned a last minute staycation in the city and we couldn't get a reservation anywhere else.   The menu looked decent some vegetarian options and an array of appetizers so... one star i guess. When we got there they took us to a table upstairs  and i thought that the decor was a bit outdated.I also noticed that the carpet was old and dirty..food particles everywhere (this wouldnt have been a problem if they didnt claim to offer a  \"sophisticated\"  experience).  Our server came over and handed us a menu and then rushed off... WE waited well over 15 minutes before she came over to get our drink order. I ordered a glass of prosecco and she looked at me and looked back at the menu and asked me to show her what i wanted (are you FN kidding me?)...maybe she wasnt familiar with their drink menu?? We also ordered an appetizer (the seitan wings) . Our server dropped by a few minutes later and we ordered our entrees. I ordered the Falafel artichoke pilaf and my bf ordered the cassoulet. 20 minutes or more  later and our appetizers still hadn't made an appearance. But alas our entrees did. I would have reminded the server but she went MIA again. When she finally showed up we asked her about the  seitan wings...she had forgotten to grab them from the kitchen. So obviously they were cold when we eventually got them My pilaf was warmish...maybe cold..not how i like my food.  It was also very blah i cant  find anything to say about the spices or the ingredients  ...definitely not a $17 entree. My bf really didnt like the cassoulet either it  was bland and missing that special something..it didnt live up to the $24 price tag.    So bottom line.... I feel like this used to be an amazing restaurant at some point but i think it has now lost its umph   ...If you are foodie dont bother going here you will be majorly disappointed. The menu sounds better than the food tastes.....the food doesnt live up to the  prices and the service is lacking in very many ways.  There  is nothing unique about the experience, ingredients or the flavours.... We spent atleast $70 and i have to say it has been once of the most disappointing experiences i have had....in a while. So if you are able to get a reservation anywhere else don't bother with six penn.   You have been warned!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Six Penn a few times a year for several years.  It holds significance to my husband and I as we met at the rooftop bar.  Unfortunately, after today's visit it seems to be showing some signs of sloppiness. My husband left hungry!  One of my biggest complaints is service.  It seems that they only have one person working the hostess stand.  The lobby/waiting area (quite small) crowds quickly, as this one person has to walk everyone to their tables.  This backs up considerably when the hostess has to take someone to sit upstairs.  Our waitress wasn't particularly friendly, and rarely checked back with us. Their beverage glasses are on the small side and filled with ice, and refills were seldom.  She took considerable time bring us the check then ringing us out.  You would think they would want to turn the table.  The food is overall good, but also showing signs of cutting back.  My husband had the six cheese pasta and petite house salad.  The \"petite\" house salad contained a nice variety of greens. Unfortunately, it was drenched in dressing. There was exactly one cherry tomato (cut in half), approx. 1/2 slice of cucumber and 1 shred of carrot.  Why bother putting anything in the salad, then?    When the six cheese pasta arrived, we were surprised as it has shrunk in size. It used to be a serving in a bowl. Now it is in a small cast-iron serving piece.  We asked the waitress if they had downsized the portions. She said it was exactly the same amount, only served in the cast-iron so it would stay warmer longer.  It is not the same sized amount- my husband and I have both gotten this a number of times.  And the excuse for the cast-iron would maybe be believeable if it was actually cooked in the cast-iron.  It was not!  The cast-iron was not hot to the touch.  I had the grilled cheese sandwich with ham and a cup of tomato soup. First, it used to come with a bowl of soup, now it is a cup for the same price.  I can't argue with the taste, as everything tasted fabulous.  While it appears that the kitchen is well-run, I saw an entire tray of food sit under the heat lamp for a full ten minutes, apparently waiting for one last item. I would've been pretty irked had that been mine.  We will probably return for lunch, but I would be hard pressed to shell out the cash for dinner considering the service."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The New York Strip was moist and flavourful. The pizza was excellent. But a little to much cheese. Overall, good experience and service."}
{"text":"I was lucky to have a gift card during my visit. My husband and I came here for some food before a cabaret show, in which he ordered a burger and I got the Prosciutto Pizza (an appetizer). I don't remember the exact prices but it came to around $30. Call me cheap but around $15 for an appetizer pizza is a bit pricey. For that money, I would expect something out of this world but my pizza was quite ordinary. In addition, the fries that came with the burger were nearly identical to what you'd find at sister restaurant Eat 'n Park. I would expect Eat 'n Park prices if Eat 'n Park food is served.   While the food was just ok, the space and decor are quite nice. I like that there are three floors, including a rooftop bar as well as bars on every floor. I do like that it feels a bit upscale, but I'm not sure how it competes with other hip restaurants and bars down the street.   Overall, Six Penn is A-ok. Nothing out of this world to me."}
{"text":"Went to Six Penn with a small group. The menu was helpful by indicating what is gluten free. We had the prosciutto pizza (with GF crust) --everyone enjoyed it. They have a huge wine selection. Staff were friendly and quick to serve. I got the grilled NY strip - I definitely recommend it! The mashed potato side was AMAZING. My husband got the espresso-cured top sirloin and was not pleased. He asked for it to be cooked medium and got it back completely cooked through and tough to eat. He returned it and the second dish he got was just as bad. Prices are pretty high, but serving sizes were good."}
{"text":"(11/10/2014) Beautiful, modern (a little cold) three floors in middle of downtown.  Popular rooftop bar in the pleasant months, private dining spaces on the second floor.  Tried several things off the lunch menu, all good, but not \"wow.\"  Most things lacked balance.  Chickpea Cake Salad was a little bit of a misnomer, the \"salad\" part more like a couple of leaves of arugula on top of each cake.  Overall, dish was overly creamy feeling (not much contrasting texture), Middle Eastern-style spicing was nice, schmear of hummus also good, but added more to the softness.  The daily soup was a Chipotle Pumpkin, smooth, robust, very, spicy, touch of pumpkin spice latte style cream swirled in, which was fine for fall.  Def the heat overpowered the sweetness of the soup and cream, it was not unbearable for me, but I could see it might be too much for others.  By contrast, the Roasted Butternut Soup that came with the Grilled Cheese a la Plancha was rather bland and much like baby food.  The grilled gruyere was fine, buttery crisp bread, pears overly sweet and spiced like pie, could've used some tartness, heat or texture to complement.  Caesar with chicken was standard, underdressed for our tastes.    Service at the bar was earnest, very friendly, a little forgetful (silverware and napkins? spoon for soup?).  Fries were standard, hot and crispy, rather plain despite the parmesan and herb garnish (not much for the cheese and herbs to stick onto).  Roasted Cauliflower Gratin was a substantial portion, runny, cauliflower touch underdone (didn't look roasted, no browning more like steamed, unless they meant the \"Cauliflower Gratin\" was roasted rather than \"Roasted Cauliflower\" gratin).  Overall decent, good place for drinks after work or power lunch, or for large parties, or if you need a convenient location downtown.  Price point the going rate for the area."}
{"text":"I gotta give this one just 3 stars. And here is why.   I stopped in for some happy hour bites and a couple of beers after work recently before catching a concert. I was looking for some decent food and drink at happy hour prices.   The beers were all marked down... to $4. Hardly a big bargain. And while all the beers would fall into the \"Good Beer\" category whoever is selecting the drafts for the the only 5 taps in the bar doesn't know the first thing about variety. One interesting dark, another that was just terrible, two extremely hoppy IPAs and Penn Pilsner- better have limited taste!  I got the wings, and they were delicious. They are smoked (not fried) and seasoned nicely. However, they were $8 for 9 wings (again... not a good price) and there were only two flavors to choose from: hot, and buffalo. Buffalo usually is \"hot\".   Good beers, though small selection, and over-priced food made this a little disappointing to me. Perhaps I'll try more things and my opinion of Six Penn will go up!"}
{"text":"Was excited to see the \"rooftop open\" sign posted out front, especially after trying a week ago and it was closed.  The hostess downstairs said she thought it was \"standing room only\" but we were just getting drinks anyway.  The roof was much smaller than I expected, and had kind of a weird shape with the elevator in he middle, which blocked any good skyline views from a small section of the bar.    When a table opened up we were able to seat ourselves.  I was disappointed that all the beers were only available in bottles, and that the selection was pretty limited--if you are someone who only drinks craft beers this place is NOT for you.  I had a blue moon, from a bottle, with a lemon, it was fine, the prices were reasonable. (Since I was driving anyway this was all probably for the best).  Maybe cocktails and wine are more of their \"thing\" but I can't tell you.  Anyway, I like rooftops and I'm glad I went, but there are a few much better options in downtown Pittsburgh that I would recommend first."}
{"text":"The first time I ate at Six Penn Kitchen was back before I even began Yelping. So by the time I was getting into the swing of reviewing things, I honestly couldn't even remember my experience here that well, beyond \"standard\". Fortunately, I've had a couple chances to eat here in the last six months or so, and both times the meals and restaurant as a whole has been much better than standard! In fact, things have been consistently great. Great food, great service...great experience all around.  Six Penn is an American bistro, so this is a great place to sample and enjoy a lot comfort foods and favorites - often with a tasty twist whipped up by their chefs. When eating here my friends, family and I have all enjoyed sweet cocktails, creamy soups, tender burgers and pork shanks, fresh pizzas, and carb-tastic pastas. Honestly, my only complaint about Six Penn is that sometimes the food is a tad on the overly seasoned and salty side. When the main ingredients are prepared as well as they are here, it's a waste to mask the real flavor with too much extra stuff.  Fortunately, this seems to be an occasional cooking error rather than the norm. And it's not like the extra flavoring ruins the food - not by a long shot. As a result, I can always step in to Six Penn confident that my meal will be good, the drinks tasty, the service attentive and prompt."}
{"text":"We had our office Christmas dinner here (we had reservations) and it was really great food, average service, awesome wine and OK environment. Thanks to my workplace I didn't have to worry about prices. All in all it was a good experience. And I'll probably be back for another special occasion.   The food was very elaborate. I had pork ramen and it was delicious. My girlfriend had the rabbit and now that was exquisite (yes she let me try it). We were having Infinitus white wine from Spain which was pretty amazing. Next time we're going for the bottle. However, we did wait long enough to get the wine refills but it did came eventually.   The environment was loud in general. I couldn't really hear my coworkers and their significant others on the other side of the table. Even though the decor and ambiance make it seem like they're trying to show a quieter, easy talk, mellow restaurant."}
{"text":"I want to say nice things but my entree came out cold, went in for warming and came out cold again. Ugh. Third times the charm. Atmosphere nice. Hope for a better experience next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I have had cocktails at Six Penn a couple times and enjoyed it, so we decided to try it for our anniversary dinner last Friday. It was just ok. We ordered the chef's tasting menu, since that's usually the most interesting option and it seemed like a good value. Like I said, tasting menus are usually pretty adventurous, but I found it to be quite bland here.   I was especially disappointed by the 4th course - the chef substituted salmon for me because I don't eat meat. It was served barely seared on the outside, and completely raw on the inside, which I thought was an odd prep for salmon. It was just not good - I could only manage a couple bites before passing the dish to my husband. He usually eats anything, but even he found the rareness unappetizing and couldn't eat it. Our server didn't check in during that course, so there was no opportunity to complain.  We'll probably only have cocktails here in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered the crackling pork shark (their signature dish) but was served cold.  The bone was warm but the pork was cold/dry it must have been yesterday's leftover with a poor attempt to reheat and serve.  May not come back."}
{"text":"Apps:  Charcuterie (small) was good for 4 people. The platter changes each month. Came with kalamata olives, side of liver pate, side of mustard, gherkins, mortadella, prosciutto, soperessatta,  aged cheddar, brie, goat cheese, and 2 pieces of toast points. The only problem with this platter is that it only comes with 2 pieces of toast.   Calamari and rock shrimp with 2 dipping sauces. The dipping sauce tasted like ranch and some kind of orange oil that really had no flavor. it was ok.  Main dish: Lamb bolognese. This dish was pretty good. Tasted like we were in Italy. The portion and flavors were on point.  Short Ribs with polenta and roasted vegetables. The meat was soft and so tender. It would have fallen of a bone had there been a bone. The gravy was a little too thick and strong for my liking. Tasted like it came out of a can, jar or powder. The polenta was kind of thick, it was more like mashed potatoes to me. Not what I am used to but it was ok.   Overall experience was good. Food and Service was ok."}
{"text":"After the great food Six Penn offered at the Yelp Elite event we expected a great brunch experience. Boy were we in for a surprise.  I'll dive right in. The muffins were cold and bland, couldn't tell what kind of muffins they were. The accompanying \"Apple butter\" tasted like nothing more than apple sauce with a ton of cinnamon added.  We had elected to try a bunch of appetizers for our meal. If even one of them had been edible it would have earned this place a second star. I hate giving 1 star reviews, but this one was deserved.   The appetizers were had were: Deviled eggs -  A terrible mix of flavors, seemed to have everything but the kitchen sink in it. Did not work together at all.   Spring Rolls with Sriracha sauce - The dish came to our table without the \"sauce\". When we asked for it, we discovered the \"sauce\" was merely sriracha from a bottle poured into a cup. (we saw them pour it). Rolls themselves were bland and unremarkable.  Sausage Grits - I'm not a fan of grits, but my wife loves them, so I'll defer to her opinion on these... which was summed up as \"These are inedible. They don't taste like anything.\"  Tempura fried bacon - Dry and unseasoned. Couldn't even taste the bacon. How do you make bacon not taste good? Truly a sad day. I was really looking forward to this one.  Boston cream beignets - When served at our table, they were already cold. They might have tasted better if they were fresh, but after one bite each, we'd had enough of Six Penn. Alas I don't think we'll be returning, a shame, because I really wanted to like the place.   I know they are capable of making good food, I had it at the elite event. Knowning that and being served this just makes me sadder... and earns them a one star rating."}
{"text":"I had heard Six Penn was great so I expected to be wow'd.  Even a Sean Penn sighting could not make this restaurant rise above mediocrity.  I ordered the smoked pork chop with honey-thyme demi, cornmeal waffles, and bacon braised greens.  This was one of the better double \"thick\" pork chops that I have eaten.  I was pleasantly surprised by its juiciness even though it was 3 inches thick.  I also got the \"Mac n Cheese.\"  The food was just average.  I was not mesmerized nor do I really remember it.  Alas, the food is unexceptional for the premium you are paying.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  However, I felt like the seating was a little crammed for an \"upscale\" eatery.  Tables around us were just an arm's length away."}
{"text":"This is the second worst meal I've eaten in the last 1.6 years since I came to the US. Words cannot describe how poorly the manager has chosen the head 'cook'. We ordered 5 items and 4 of them made it back to the kitchen. Only one item was eaten. The eggs Benedict which is served on cake as opposed to an English muffin. We were greeted with table bread (cake) and 1/8th of the menu items are cake related. I don't even know how this place is busy. Wait staff are nice but the food is bewildering. Can you say scrapple? Welcome to the foundation of their menu."}
{"text":"The food was good . We ordered several items off the appetizer menu . The problem was the service . It was very very slow . After we sat down , we didn't see a server for ten minutes and there was only one other table occupied in the place. I had to get up and complain . Once I did , the service improved dramatically ."}
{"text":"To agree with the thoughts of other reviewers, I believe Six Penn to be a fantastic drink/graze space and less worth it for a full-on dinner. On a clear night, the rooftop deck makes for excellent drink-consuming and people-watching, and their cocktail list downstairs is usually spot-on. The bar menu and desserts aren't breaking any culinary records, but we've enjoyed seasonal chow like a pumpkin roll, pirogues, and seared scallops without complaint.   Without having sampled it, I can't speak to the quality of the dinner menu, but the price-dish matchup seems inflated to me. Entrees in the 20-30s for typical American fare."}
{"text":"what a Great Menu selection for Sunday brunch !  WOW !  was I blown away with the savory crab eggs benedict , to those damm Good Boston Cream beignets .... perfect in a cold rainy day !  hard to believe that downtown Pittsburgh only rates this with 3 stars, they should add a FULL MOON and the Whole universe !  Great Staff and run by one the Best Chefs in town !  Kudos on a great menu and for keeping up with other great cities across the USA Chef !  Your staff is tops and you can damm be sure that YOU WILL SEE ME again !"}
{"text":"Good menu, strong service. Bored hostesses at the front need to have their attitudes checked. Talent fir the job is minimal. Just be nice. They both acted as if they held the golden ticket. It's just walking us to a table. Get over yourselves. We will come back fir the gnocchi and the strip steak. Might pass on the pork."}
{"text":"I love Six Penn for Sunday brunch or after-work drinks--especially if the rooftop deck is open.  However, I find their dinner menu to be bland and overpriced.  Recently, I went to a rehearsal dinner here in a private room and was disappointed with the service and food.  The salads were not as ordered and the chicken was very dry...The only redeeming quality of the dinner was the good friends who were sharing good beer (Bell's Oberon on tap) and the grasshopper deserts (think gourmet Thin Mints)."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I always enjoy it. It's a great location with 2 floors and a rooftop seating. The servers are always real nice. The beer selection isn't bad. The food is always tasty. My favorite part is grabbing a drink on the rooftop...always fun.   The only reason it's not 5 stars is that's there is nothing about Six Penn that really stands out as extraordinary.  It's a great, above average, spot for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I was at an outing, where we serve various dishes and wines.  From the steak to the pasta I had the same feeling, good but not great.  I'll come here if someone else is paying, but I am not seeking it out on my own."}
{"text":"Great brunch on the rooftop today! The jalapeño and horseradish infused vodka Bloody Mary's were great. The eggs Benedict and grits were tasty. No wait and a great way to kick off a Steeler Sunday. The staff was great."}
{"text":"I've only ever come here for the rooftop bar, and to be honest--it's not the best rooftop downtown. The drinks and appetizers are good, and decently priced for happy hour (M-F, 5-7). The rooftop space is limited, so don't plan on getting a seat!"}
{"text":"A nice place for dinner.  We rolled in in shorts and t shirts, and they were super nice to us despite the fact that we were obviously quite underdressed.  The setting is very modern, there's a small menu of well executed dishes. The prices were also very good for the quality of the food.   It didn't blow any of our minds, but we were all really happy with the food, service and atmosphere. The rooftop patio is also pretty great."}
{"text":"I so really like this place. Is it a bit overpriced? Yes. But the experience of downtown and a show is worth the splurge. I almost always get the pork shank which is pretty damn good. You can split it with an up charge which I recommend because it's Flintstone-like. Had the cheese plate on an afternoon with a bottle wine for happy hour with friends on the rooftop. Nice for Pittsburgh with the limited amount of outdoor dining."}
{"text":"I went here on a first date and the atmosphere was nice but it had a strange seating arrangement. We were seated on the second floor and the tables were too high for my liking, made me feel like a child. The tables were also fairly long, making it a little difficult to have a conversation without feeling that everyone can hear.   My date ordered us the calamari appetizer and it was delicious! Later I had the chicken and I wasn't too impressed, a little dry but nothing too good or too bad.   I would like to try again."}
{"text":"Food is good, not great. Service is slow and the portions are small if truly hungry then I would look elsewhere."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this place tonight before seeing a show at the Benedum. We had made a reservation for 5:30pm but we were stuck in traffic and running late. My friend called the hostess at the stand to let her know and she was very friendly. She thanked her for calling and said no problem we will hold your table. When we got there, we were seated right away and we were immediately served water at our table. Our server, Jordan came over to let us know the specials and answer any menu questions. She was very pleasant and knowledgeable about all of the food they offered and even made great suggestions for us when we weren't sure what to order. We ended up getting the Pinot Grigio sangria to drink. It was tasty and went down a little too smoothly lol. They also serve you an assortment of breads with infused oil which was my favorite part of the meal-so good!  We ordered the calamari appetizer to share and it was good but I wasn't crazy about the dipping sauces it came with.  My friend ordered the pork shank for her entree. She absolutely loved her meal, said the meat was tender and flavorful and falling off the bone. She enjoyed the dipping sauce it came with as well. I had the seafood bucatini. I did love that the noodles were cooked Al dente. The sugar snap peas were also cooked perfectly-not too raw but not mushy, just right. The shrimp, mussels and crab were also cooked well. While I did enjoy my entree for the most  part, it wasn't really over the top and definitely not the best meal I've had downtown. I was expecting more. I do have to say that the service here was definitely wonderful. Our server was very attentive and friendly and so were the other employees. We may return for dessert and after dinner drinks but there are just so many other restaurants in Pittsburgh to try."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here when having an early rooftop dinner on a Saturday. The service was neglectful and it took almost an hour to get our food, almost making us late for the show we were on our way to. The food was average at best."}
{"text":"I'm torn - came for a yelp elite event a few months ago and it deserved a 4-5 star review.  Went tonight (last night it's open) and was just ok.  Wine selection was fab - service was great - the food we ordered was just ok.  It is a great location, especially if you're coming for a show at the Benedum but sad to say it's closing tonight so won't be around for future outings :-("}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. The service was sloppy and the time between courses was forever. The soup came cold (sent it back) and we ordered crab cakes and they were mushy and ground to dust. No taste but darn expensive. I would not go back. There are a LOT better downtown."}
{"text":"We happened to come across Six Penn as it was near our hotel. Very cool spot with a nice urban interior and a fantastic rooftop bar. Admittedly we didn't eat here, but the menu looked good although a bit on the pricey side. The drinks were great though. An extensive selection of beers and nice atmosphere which is all together what we were looking for."}
{"text":"Vegetarian perspective-  Best vegan prix fixe dinner I have had in Pittsburgh. I specifically choose this restaurant for restaurant week because it had a vegan option (in addition to steak and fish).  Ambiance is bustling but cozy. Great location of you are catching a show. Street parking is hard but there is a parking garage right across the street. I enjoyed my $6 nojito (since I was DD). The prix fixe started with a yummy root vegetable salad with a variety of beets, radishes, and carrots. I also enjoyed the somewhat random sweet cookie type bar which was part of the salad. The star of the show was the Moroccan tangine. Steaming hot with excellent flavors and beans as well as a house made naan, this was my favorite vegetarian dish in the past 6 months of dining out! There was enough to take home for a second meal! I was also pleasantly surprised by the vegan chocolate mouse, beautifully presented and I liked the subtle coconut milk flavor. The dish was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of berries.  Service and pace were excellent, we would be happy to return again!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I went but I would have to say I was really blown away. The service and atmosphere was great and the food is fantastic! It's definitely more for adults than for kids. I highly recommend if you get to talk to the manager David ask for his recommendations. Really knows his stuff and has a passion for his work!"}
{"text":"Great evening with friends from out of town.  Situated in the middle of the cultural district.  The highlight was watching the snow fall (our friends are from the south) during our fabulous meal.  Jordyn was an attentive server and her recommendations for dinner choices were outstanding.  The bartender \"Sugar\" was also attentive.  Thank you for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Went there for restaurant week last time and to this day, my husband still talks about the pork shank he ate. Out. Of. This. World. I can't even remember exactly what I ordered, that's how good his pork was. I think I got some type of risotto, which was also fantastic. Located right downtown and being pretty busy for restaurant week, we weren't able to get a table upstairs, so we sat at the lower level. We both enjoyed how you can see the chefs cooking and kept us entertained while we waited for our meals (which wasn't long). Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and we were in and out in an hour, tops.  I did not think there were a lot of menu options, but from our experience, everything we ordered was amazing. This is a great spot if you're catching a show downtown and don't have a lot of time to grab something to eat, yet it still gives you the feel of a nice restaurant and I was able to enjoy my meal without feeling rushed. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have to go with consensus here - this place is good, but has a few gaping holes. If you're adventurous, go for it.  If you're trying to impress a group -- my reservations were for a work group of 10 aged 26-60 -- there are enough \"ehhh\" dishes on the menu that you'd wish you'd gone elsewhere.     Stay away from the Beet Salad.  They say it has it's in a balsamic vinagrette.  All I got were oil-soaked lettuce leaves (BP?  Is that you?) and some hidden beets.  It was almost tasteless."}
{"text":"Ate here once for lunch.   Not bad, upscale atmosphere, very limited menu.  There wern't a ton of people there but yet it seemed to take them a while to get us the food.  It was worth the try, maybe I will go again and maybe not.  I had the pulled pork.  It was good but not super filling and a little pricey for the size"}
{"text":"Good place, I enjoyed the dinner menu more then the lunch. Service is very good, I wasn't 100% thrilled with my lunch choice and they took it off the bill no problem. Desert was great! Rooftop is the place to sit if you go here!"}
{"text":"While some of the reviews \"knock\" this place, I really disagree as we were friendly greeted, quickly accommodated, and finely served.  Plus, the food was top-notch - which is what you want, right?  Our waiter was more than happy to meet our time constraint needs to make our show at nearby Heinz Hall - so drinks, apps, and child dinners got to the table swiftly and full of flavor.  The adult entrees arrived shortly thereafter and were both delicious and well portioned. While there is a small menu, it was still difficult to choose our grub as most items looked pretty darn good.  All said, its good eats in a vibrant atmosphere.  Just vibrant enough to squeeze in a second cocktail before scurrying out the door.    So, if you're looking for a meal before a nearby show, I'd recommend this place in a second. If you're looking for solid cocktails once the curtains go down, I'd recommend this place, too.  We'll certainly be back...whether its showtime or just because...Six Penn is a winner!"}
{"text":"I frequent Six Penn, mostly for lunch. They recently did some renovating in the kitchen and, from today's visit, some deep cleaning.  Now don't get me wrong, this by no means a dirty restaurant, but I did notice that the light fixtures particularly gleam since they reopened after a few days respite.   Sadly, I must report that the glorious calamari po' boy is no more. I went periodically for the tender tendrils of calamari and the slightly tangy aioli. Please, please, PLEASE bring it back!! My server said many other guests have asked about its sad departure.  Based on other Yelp reviews, I'm not the only one who loved the po' boy!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a difference a few weeks and a second visit makes.  I eagerly anticipated returning to Six Penn after the first 5 star visit while traveling to Pittsburgh on business.   This visit was less than stellar.   The menu had changed which is understandable, although I was looking forward to ordering the brussel sprouts that I had during the previous visit, but I guess those were a part of the winter menu as was the deconstructed wedge salad.   There was not much that interested me on the \"Spring\" menu so I proceeded to order a la carte.   I ordered the flash fried calamari and rock shrimp, side of parmesan rosemary fries and a side of french green beans.   The calamari and rock shrimp were not very crispy, kinda greasy and had no flavor.  There was lots of calamari and very few shrimp.   The fries were just luke warm with very little parmesan cheese and no rosemary flavoring.  The french green beans were a complete \"miss' for me.  Steamed whole green bean, dressed in an herb vinagrette with grape halves and whole toasted hazelnuts.   The vinagrette had very little flavor and the grapes and hazelnuts just didn't belong.  I left very disappointed, especially compared to my first visit."}
{"text":"I brought my parents here for brunch after a show and I was so disappointed!!!  First off let me begin by saying this is such a great location and visually awesome restaurant. We have been to 6 Penn in the past (4 years ago) and maybe their evening menu is better or maybe they have just gone down hill??  Missing the Burgh we just moved back and ended up here hoping for a great brunch.  I have to start off by saying don't believe the menu.   Banana Foster French toast.... This must have made me the most angry..... Sliced bananas on French toast dusted with confectionary sugar is a JOKE and a disgrace to the name banana foster. How hard is it to toss some bananas in a sauté pan with some butter, brown sugar, and a bit of rum??? After all that is what banana foster is!  So you can pay 12 bucks for the mere idea of banana foster but not the real thing.    I ordered a monte cristo sandwich and it was suppose to come with maple syrup. I was looking forward to that flavor profile of having something savory and sweet maple syrup as a condiment. They brought me regular table syrup not maple syrup .....again don't believe the menu ....you get to pay for the idea of maple syrup just not the real thing. The sandwich itself was dry leathery and had a funky taste....not good eats!  The home fries were dried up cubes that appeared to be deep fried? Definitely not home fries. Save yourself a lot of money and be nice to your taste buds...go to a diner for brunch not here."}
{"text":"If you like over cooked cold eggs with cold steak for breakfast it's a place to go! High price with horrible food, slow service. It took 45 min to get our food for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Living downtown I have the distinct privilege of being able to eat at great and not so great restaurants on a regular this leads to a bit of a foodie malaise as I am inundated with the good and the bad frequently. Then a night like tonight happens! Welcome to the trendy Six Penn Kitchen! I walked in without a reservation waiting for the inevitable \"do you have a reservation\" with the slight eye roll and pretentiousness that comes with that loaded question. Instead I was greeted warmly at the door with a \"good evening\". I let them know I didn't have a reservation but was hoping to grab a table. They very politely let me know that it would be approximately fifteen minutes to reset a table or we could choose to sit at a high top table without the wait. Let the fun begin! My party of three sat at a high top in the bar area and were promptly approached by the bartender asking if we would like a drink. He took our order with ease and I threw him a curve ball. I asked for a drink I had experienced earlier in the week for the first time and man it was good. Unfortunately he hadn't heard of it before but instead of say nope, sorry, or HUH he politely let me know he didn't know the drink then hit me with a few popular ones he could nail. I asked for my fall back drink I LOVE the Moscow Mule which he said he could do without the copper cup and I was good with that! I'll tell you this much no copper cup didn't mess up his mules trip to Moscow one bit quite a tasty drink.   On to our table which was situated nicely in a beautifully appointed dinning area near the open view kitchen. I don't know who decorated and designed this space but they are brilliant! The lighting was bright enough to be cheery but dimmed enough to make for a potential romantic setting for a date or a nice dinner with your family. The kitchen is a lively, teeming view which gives a taste of trendy awesome but also feels a bit like watching Hell's Kitchen live and your getting the food. The volume is superb not loud so you can speak with your table without raising your voice and not quiet so you feel like you're eating at a pretentious swank establishment where grabbing the wrong fork may lead to snickers and pointing. So the atmosphere of this cool and upbeat place immediately grabs me and sets me down a path to what would become possibly the best dinning experience I've had living in Downtown Pittsburgh. Our server David was prompt, polite, professional and in a true sign of a great server eased us into our dinning experience. He gave us time to peruse the menus was unobtrusive and there when we had a question.  On to the good stuff... THE FOOD!!! So I'm not sure why or how this place ended up with a three star!!!  We ordered the Flash Fried Calamari & Shrimp as an appetizer. As our food came to the table our server kindly introduced us to the plate from the main ingredients along with the great sauces provided. MAN it was GOOD!!! The chef and his crew made sure that the calamari and shrimp were the stars of this appetizer which lead to a tender, moist, and lightly breaded mound of scrumptiousness. What a way to kick off a dinner! What made the meal even better was watching and listening to the Executive Sous-Chef de Cuisine Corey Hughes. He directed the kitchen like a WWII field general maintaining the smooth troop movements and precise battle field execution. He deftly controlled the pass ensuring that only the best was leaving his kitchen to tickle the guests palates. I thank you sir for your deft touch it made this moment in culinary time suspend, twist, and turn on my taste buds like mmmmm yumminess! Then the entree's reach the table with the elegance of Cinderella descending to the dance floor to meet prince charming. Once landed in front of our eyes the entree's stood there gorgeously plated screaming for forks, knives and the gnashing of our terrible teeth!  We ordered the \"signature\" Cracklin Pork Shank, Gourmet Burger, and Buffalo Mac N' Cheese.   HOLY CRUD, OMG, ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!! The burger my wife ordered looked amazing and my wife couldn't put it down. According to her this 8oz. burger was juicy with a crown of ham and egg which left her sorry it was gone. My daughter let me steal a bite of her Buffalo Mac N' Cheese again the food was stuck on awesome. The bite I had was cheesy real cheesy and instead of just tasting cheese there was a plethora of other subtleties then the real surprise twist some heat oh yeah some good heat that made this cheesy, ooey, gooeyness just right! On to the dish I took a chance on and I am so, so, so glad I did. It was listed on the menu in their \"Signature\" section. Well let me tell you something SIGNATURE INDEED!!!! I thought I needed a knife to attack this huge portion of meat. To my surprise again the meat fell off the bone quite literally fell off the bone. It was moist, perfect, melt in your mouth goodness."}
{"text":"I come here every time I have tickets to a nice event nearby, usually at the Heinz theatre. It is always a good choice and I've always left feeling very satisfied. Their drinks menu is extensive and last time I went, I tried the Jamaican Me Ginger cocktail, which I highly recommend! My table and I also ordered the Chickpea Cakes, which exceeded my expectations. I got the Hudson Valley Duck Breast entree. The duck was very good and the meat was so tender. The gnocchi, however, tasted a bit bland, and I ended up leaving the majority of it on the plate. Nonetheless, it was still a good meal!  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great wine, amazing location...this was an over the top event. Locally grown food was featured throughout the evening.   The space was a bit crowded and loud, however it was fun talking the the local farmers and wine merchants. I was particularly impressed by Penn's Corner, their food is great and they were very friendly.   Heather from Southern Wines was very knowledgeable and offered a great Tempranillo and a wonderful Chardonnay.  Lots of great food, interesting conversation and fantastic wine all made for a fun evening."}
{"text":"We enjoyed one of the last warm nights of the year on the rooftop terrace here. They don't take reservations for the terrace, so we were lucky to get a table immediately. We had a few appetizers, of which the pizza and cheese & charcuterie plate stood out for me. The mussels were OK, didn't try the chicken wings but they looked good too. For main I had the New York strip with brussels sprouts and mash. The meat was cooked as I asked for and really good. The brussels sprouts were slightly too crunchy and lacked seasoning. Biggest struggle was finding a good red wine. The glas of Californian cabernet I ordered was way too cold and not my taste at all. The pinot noir from Chile was better but a bit light on colour and taste for that grape variety. The service was good and attentive."}
{"text":"We were exploring the city and decided to stop in...we opted for the roof top seating and loved it.  Food, service and drinks were all GREAT!!!  The roof top seating was fun!!!  It was a great time!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love when we stumble on a great place!  We went for Sunday Brunch. The menu had everyone covered. sweet, savory, spicy and traditional. The food was great. The Smoked Bloody Mary was even better! Too bad they only make that on Sundays. If you are stuck in a Hotel downtown, don't settle for a powdered eggs and  dry white toast. Get out and try it! Happy hour was great too."}
{"text":"SixPenn Kitchen is by far one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. I have been a fan of this place since it opened and it only gets better. My friend and I go to SixPenn every year for our birthday dinner, and any chance I get to get in a meal here before a theater show, I do.   Now, my favorite picks on their menu had always been their calamari appetizer, and their pork shank entree. Both TO DIE for. The pork shank dish is a staple and it's one of the items that never change off of the menu. Eleven months ago, I decided to switch over to a plant based diet. I don't eat the calamari or pork shank anymore (although I still recommend them for their fabulousness!), now my go-to staple dish is their falafel. It's AMAZING! They have a great wine and specialty drink list to choose from, and the desserts never disappoint. The best part of the end of the meal are their homemade peppermint patties that come with your check.  I was at SixPenn Kitchen last night for a networking event with my young professional group. They accommodated us with the upstairs bar area, and blocked it off for our 50+ person event. The cheese tray and dessert trays were a perfect addition for our guests as well.  Whether you're stopping in for a nice dinner before a show, hosting a private party, or even a networking event, SixPenn fits every situation. If you've never been, add it to your bucket list of places to go in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Sadly, Six Penn is still stumbling after their great beginning under Keith Fuller. No innovations in the menu for a long time, poor quality control in the kitchen, and indifference have brought down a promising restaurant. Does anyone at Eat And Park corporation read Yelp?"}
{"text":"Chic decor, extremely friendly service, very accommodating and fresh food.  Why only three stars?  The food didn't make me say \"Mm-mm.\"  Tried several items since we were a large group and all were good but almost basic diner flavors.  Not a bad thing...just not a \"you must go\" type of place.  Nevertheless they were very accommodating and even hooked me up with a side dish of the buffalo mac-n-cheese since a really wanted to try it."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I had heard about this place and we were anxious to give it a try.  It's a bit of a walk from work (the Federal Building), so we decided what better weather than a beautiful October day in the 'Burgh to take a little stroll over here?    The food here is pretty decent, but I'd have to say it was a little pricey.  In all fairness though, they do have interesting selections here--much better than your standard \"burgers-to-go\" places.  Most sandwiches run around $10.00 each.  Entrees run somewhat more.  They do have a roasted pizza with mozzerella, basil and roasted tomatoes that sounded tempting.  I tried the \"Turkey Bobby\" which is turkey breast, bread stuffing, cranberry sauce & mayo on ciabatta.    But this place gets very busy around lunchtime and it seems that they get very overwhelmed here.  It's better to go between 1pm and 2pm for a late lunch like we did.    They  serve dinner here and brunch too.  It's probably better to go then.  They do have one brunch item that sounds interesting:  the breakfast sausage corndog.  It comes with 2 eggs, tater tots, and Hollandaise sauce."}
{"text":"My wife and I happened to go into Six Penn in a walk from parking to the theater because it was cold and windy.  Are we glad we did. Even though we just had wine and an appetizer of homemade pretzels, it all was delicious. We were directed upstairs to a table near the bar.  Our two waiters, Dan and Nikko, made us feel right at home and like we were old customers.  Their service was impeccable. Another surprise was that the manager, David Felaenato (spelling) came up to our table and made us welcome also.  Hey , nothing special about us, but he wanted to know where we lived, etc. Unbelievable short time. You can bet though, we will be back. BTW.....he told us we had parked in the parking garage across the street, the parking bill would have been $2. Go have a great time!"}
{"text":"Six Penn Kitchen is closing. To me this is a great loss for the Pittsburgh Cultural District.   Good Food, Fast 'enough', convenient for all cultural events in the district, from Heinz Hall to the Benedum Center. Easy to establish reservations for pre, or post show. Great rooftop.  We don't eat here every trip to the district to see a show, ballet, symphony or what ever. But we do eat here often enough to value their contribution to the district.  We are going to badly miss Six Penn Kitchen. To me this is nothing short of a big loss for the cultural community.   Will anybody be so kind as to suggest an in-kind replacement that could be viewed as similar in cuisine??  Thanks Six Penn Kitchen, You are going to be missed!"}
{"text":"I ate here while on business in Pittsburgh. I had wandered for hours all over Pittsburgh with the intention of casually stumbling upon a place for lunch. I had a little more trouble then I anticipated. It came to the point where I was desperate and about to jump off of one of the many bridges leaving downtown that I had crossed that day. Finally, to save me from the icy freezing february waters of the Allegheny River I stumbled across Six Penn.   The first thing I noticed: it's warm. At that point it was all I really cared about. I was seated immediately at a table for two and I sat facing the street so I could look out. My waiter was very friendly and came over immediately with water. I asked what he would suggest on the menu, but unfortunately suggested almost all meat plates (I'm not a big meat eater). That's when I saw under appetizers just what I wanted that day: A grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup (9).  I also ordered a side of their homemade potato chips that I had seen someone else with (3).   Food: Deeeelish! The tomato soup was wonderful! Thick and creamy and hot and delicious. The grilled cheese sandwich: cheesy and buttery and an artery clogger, but just what I needed at the time. And the homemade potato chips were to die for. I also ordered desert, I got the brownie sundae (6.50). The desert was decent, but I was expecting a little more for the price, still very good though.  I recommend Six Penn Kitchen and if I ever go back I will try it for dinner as my waiter mentioned there was a separate dinner menu."}
{"text":"I will try and find the best things about our meal.. the service was good..the teenager said the burger was good..oh yeah, and the bread was good. The main courses were just not good at all. I had the Primavera pasta. I added about 2 Tbs of grated cheese and it still had no flavor. My man had the brisket gnocchi. That was not what we expected at all. It is about 5 (maybe baked) gnocchi's on top of a plate of brisket that was dry and other than the sauce pretty much flavorless. We had those three items, drank only water and the bill  with 20% tip was over $70. Definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"The food is good. I've dined here many times over the past several years. Unfortunately, it does seem as though the service is going progressively downhill. I had dinner there last week with a party of four in advance of a show that we were attending. I actually selected Six Penn because they typically cater to theater-goers and thought that we would be able to enjoy our dinner and get to the show on time. Unfortunately, we had to wait for a very long time once we were seated to be visited by the waiter. We ordered our food the first time he came to the table, along with our drinks. We waited about 50 minutes for the food to come out, at which point, I ordered another drink. The second drink did not arrive until the check - which turned out to be the wrong check. As I quickly gulped down my prosecco and waited for the correct check, time was ticking away. By the time we finally settled the bill, we were late to the show. On top of that, the people in my party that ordered the special did not receive the meal as it was described, although they said it was good. There was a lot of confusion and I don't blame it on our waiter because it seems as though the entire restaurant was running in a state of chaos (even though it was only about 60% full when we arrived). It wasn't a horrible experience, but it was disappointing and probably not worth going back now that there are so many options in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Nice spot. Can have restaurant seating, at the small bar or hit up the rooftop when weather permits. Rooftop is a cozy space. Drinks are fair. About the same price as the rest of the bars in the area. Enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"So, on a recent trip to Pittsburgh, we attempted to dine at Meat and Potatoes but they were completely booked.  We wanted something else in the area and ended up here.  We were a little scared at first because the reviews of this place are not super great.  That being said, we ended up having a really nice brunch!  We were seated in their balcony which was nice and quiet.  Even without a reservation, we were seated right away.  I ordered a blackberry bellini and it was delicious.  Our table also tried the beignets and they were yummy, too.  I ordered the traditional breakfast meal and it was really yummy and worked well with my low fodmap diet.  Everyone really liked their food.  The portions were healthy and appropriately priced.  Our server was super nice and helpful. He was a little slow in bringing us our checks at the end which soured the experience some but overall we had an enjoyable meal here and we were glad we stumbled in!"}
{"text":"Never going back brunch was ok had steak and eggs service wasn't so great I'm a server  too in the downtown area and would never treat anybody the way I got treated here never ask how anything was if I need anything else barely seen the guy truthful it was a bit busy but nothing crazy and I usually will tip really really well but I felt like the guy wasn't worth 18 percent they suggested sorry won't be back !!"}
{"text":"We had an early dinner here on Saturday with friends and family.  The service and food were just very below average unfortunately. We are used to attending very good eateries throughout our travels and based on the element and menu -- was very disappointed. I am not a complainer but a moajority of our food came out cold and there was nothing extraordinary about the meals. The server should not be handling large groups of patrons because she was very dissheveled and confused."}
{"text":"Stopped in without a reservation on a Saturday night. Received service right away and was seated at the seating overlooking the kitchen. These turn out to be my favorite seats at restaurants. Where you get to watch all the action as it happens. The food was on point as always. Service was fast... In and out because we had tickets to the hockey game. Less than 40 minutes and we were on our way. As always recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I went to Six Penn Kitchen a few months ago when the weather was still mild.   First of all, I love the location! I'm a big fan of Downtown Pittsburgh venues especially ones like this that have rooftop seating.   The food was great. I had duck which I never ate before this. I would not say that duck became my favorite kind of meat after this but it was prepared very well and the presentation was beautiful.   The staff was very attentive and kind. I had no problem getting sat along with my 7:30pm reservation on a Friday night I made via Open Table.  Parking is the only thing I really disliked but that is an overall problem in any major city.  I posted more about Six Penn Kitchen on my blog at http://midnightguru.com/place.php?id=73"}
{"text":"This is my usual pre-theater spot. They have a great wine list, elevated comfort foods, and fantastic service. My friend and I received prompt service and made it to the Benedum center to see a show, with time to spare. My friend had the pork shank with roasted apples, applesauce, and mashed potatoes. She had ordered it during a previous visit and it was so good that she had to order it again! Due to my food allergies, I ordered the NY strip steak with mashed potatoes and plain green beans. They take food allergies into consideration and actually asked if any diners had any dietary restrictions when we made the reservation. However, they lost a star for me because I believe there was SOME cross-contamination with a utensil or pan while preparing my meal. I could smell garlic (I wasn't sure if it was my plate or my friend's) and had some stomach upset after the meal (I am obviously allergic to garlic). I likely shouldn't have eaten it, so that's partially my fault, but we were in a rush and I knew it wasn't something extremely serious. Thank goodness it was only one of my mild allergies and not a more severe one, but I will let the staff know to be more careful in the future."}
{"text":"The bar is in a beautiful building and the waiters were friendly and helpful but the food was just not very good for the price. Its very generic run of the mill food something you may expect at a decent restaurant but really nothing exciting on the menu nor anything I ate that was particularly well cooked. Overall an average experience but for the price there are much better places in the area"}
{"text":"I live in the city and ordered an eggs Benedict to go. Stupid me for not checking the food because this is what I got. I called back to tell them about it and they offered me their house fries that were supposed to come with the meal. Shame on the chef for even plating that and calling it worth 18 dollars."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a coworker on Friday, the weekend of Memorial Day weekend. I had the Pennsylvania portobello sandwich with barley salad that was pretty good. My coworker had the grilled cheese sandwich and she also liked her lunch. Our biggest complaint was the wait time. We couldn't understand it because the restaurant really wasn't that busy. It seem like our server totally forgot about us. That's why I'm giving this review three stars."}
{"text":"This is a classy place, with a great roof deck and drink menu, as well as a creative entree menu overall.  And the whole time I'm there, I can't help but think:  \"I can't believe that this is owned by Eat 'N Park.   I've been there for lunch and dinner, as well as just drinks.  All experiences have been positive.  One of my favorite things about Six Penn (besides the roof deck) is that you can book reservations online.  This makes it very easy/convenient for business lunches.   For lunch, I'd recommend the Cuban Quesadilla, which is light enough not to make you tired when you get back to work, but still filling and very tasty.   I've also had the Wood Oven Roasted Pizza, which is excellent and very filling. I swear I didn't think while eating those things that \"I can't believe this is owned by Eat 'N Park\".  Honest.   For dinner, it's almost as though the atmosphere turns to an older crowd, with a lot of the theater-goers going there before of after the show.   For dinner, I'd recommend the Jamison Farm Lamb Shank, which looks like something you'd find at the LeMont (appearance only - not going to argue quality as I am no chef).   For drinks, this place is top 10 in terms of creativity.  I had lunch there with someone who works for the Eat 'N Park Hospitality Group, who told me that they hired a Mixologist to create new drinks for them.  Where is the line to apply for being a mixologist.  Can you imagine the mixologist's surprise when he confirmed that it was Eat 'N Park calling?   This is not a dig on Eat 'N Park...I'm just saying....  And last but not least, there's the roof deck.  It's a little small, but it's awesome.  There are little patio-like areas for people to sit, and a bar in the back. Decent views of part of the skyline.  Why don't we have more roof-top decks in this town?  Great summer destination."}
{"text":"My first trip to six Penn kitchen. General observation was that some of the details need to be reworked or renewed. Staff was a bit surly. Bartender was not helpful and seemed bothered that we sat at the bar to wait for the others in our reservation. Our waiter shared that same attitude when we were seated. The food was mostly very good. The Ceasar salad was really good. Lamb Bolognese was served very warm and was good. The scallops were also said to be very good. The loser was my gorgonzola gnocchi. It was an incredibly small portion, barely filling the bottom of the large bowl in which it was served. I'm guessing it was over cooked as there were no identifiable gnocci. I identified some meat squares,and a few small cubes of zucchini. Mostly it was mush in a pool of oil. It did have potential but was more like a leftover stew after all of the things you wanted are already eaten. It would have been a good dip for bread if we had been offered some. Mostly decent food, servers with bad attitude or no interest in their customer, maintenance details that could be refreshed, all provide a dining experience that could be significantly better with Management of the details."}
{"text":"We met another couple at Six Penn for dinner and, overall, it was a decent experience.  The food was good and it was gluten free friendly for my wife.  We ordered two appetizers....calamari and the mussels.  Both very good.  I had the signature pork shank and it was very very good.  The only thing that prevented me from giving it more than 3 stars was the service....it was not good at all.  We had to wait for everything including almost 15 minutes for coffee after dinner.  It made us just forget about dessert because we didn't want to kill another 45 minutes waiting."}
{"text":"I would really really love to like this place.  It is next to where I work, and seems to have the right \"cost/ambience\" ratio for a lot of work related meals.  The ambience is actually fine, the service is fine as well, though it seems like most of the servers are in training at any given moment.  The problem is that the food is really really inconsistent.  I am not particularly picky and I think that I can fairly discern when a dish is not my cup of tea (i.e., uses ingredients that I do not like, e.g., eggplant) vs. just plain awful recipes.  I once ordered crab cakes here.  the dish came with two crab cakes. They were so awful, that I could not eat more than 1/4 of one cake--even though I was hungry and would have like to have eaten them.  They have a couple of nice things like their super thin potato fries, but it is just not a great place.  Again--I wish it were, there is great copper cladding on the outside that is oxidizing nicely, they serve decent sandwiches for lunch so it will probably survive as a business lunch place but I don't think it is up to snuff as a place to look forward to for a meal.  One thing I like about the place is that they have some pots/buckets on top where they grow some of their own produce.  I doubt it is enough for all of their needs, but I like the effort.  What is sad is that despite some really great concepts and ideas, they just do not execute their food in a way that I can recommend."}
{"text":"I struggled with the  star rating on this one and really think it's a three and a half.   Here's the rundown...  Atmosphere.   The place was nice, but the table arrangement seemed a little odd.   There were a few tables that I would not have been happy with.     Drinks.  My cocktails (standard Captain and coke) were good..served with a lime that actually had some juice.     Bread.  The pepper bread was really good.  The other selection was a little dry.  The honey butter was good, but much improved by a little sprinkling of salt.    Soup.   The SOD was a poblano corn chowder, which was delicious.   Perfect temp and consistency, with just a hint of spice.     Entree.   My experience here was kind of mixed.  I ordered the special...redfish and crab over roasted tomatoes, purple beans, and broth.   The broth was amazing!  Rich and flavorful...I wanted to lick the bowl.   The crab and tomatoes were also awesome.   The redfish was not so great.  It was really tough and dry...I needed to use a knife to cut it.   The purple beans were described as \"like green beans, but with a purple vein\"...which is really not a great description.   Honestly, the beans are more like edamame.  Tender  beans inside a pretty tough pod.   I didn't love them.    Service. So-so.   My cocktails was empty for quite some time and overall, she just seemed a step behind.   Not \"bad\" by any means, but not exceptional either."}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner after going to a PSO concert across the street. Had reservation and was seated at the first table by the door, the one next to the stairs to second floor. Upon sitting down, we found the table was wobbly. Had some guy come over and stick a piece of folded up paper underneath. Didn't quite fix it but at least it was spilling water anymore.  Noisy environment. OK I understand it was Friday night but still it was noisier than I'd have liked. Prices correctly reflect it's downtown location. However, food was just OK. Ordered crab cakes for some $28 and definitely not the best I've had. Good thing was that it was mostly all crab meat and very little filler but I wasn't impressed by the quality of the meat. Service seemed lacking as well."}
{"text":"Impressive Food and Drink list! And Nice, polish urban spot to visit as a first time Pitts traveler!  I came here in a posse for a early work dinner outing as it was suggested by my boss.  When you enter, you're immediately greeted with long stretch hard wood floors with high ceiling and caramel gold lighting along with the friendly staff. We quickly got seated to our table of 4, then later 5.  I was very impressed with their extensive drink menu as it had a lot of choices! And their farm to table concept is always a winner for me!  APPS: We started with the charcuterie dish. Had a nice blend of meats and cheese. There were 3 types, blue, Brie-like, and harvarti-like, which I preferred.  Soup: I had their seafood soup, it had a nice balance between smoke and savory as it came in a thin texture.   Main: swordfish special: it was over a squash purée paired with a savory multi-bean blend scattered with pickled cauliflower topped with the grilled swordfish. Food presentation was on point; however, it was served cold as it may have came out too early, but thanks to our greet attentive server, she quickly took my dish, apologized and re-heated it and brought it back and I definitely enjoyed.   Other parties had some great looking dishes, which are posted on here.  Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"Oh Six Penn... I wish I wasn't so torn on this review, but sometimes that happens in the Yelp world. First, let me say that the atmosphere is probably my favorite thing about this place. There are 3 levels total. The first level dining/bar area which allows a view of the kitchen, the second level that also has a bar, but is more of an event space and last the roof top which is my favorite space. The roof top is pretty tiny, but they have high top tables, cabanas and a tiny bar area which makes this a cozy spot for brunch or happy hour. Since there are 3 levels they do have an elevator for those that cannot climb steps. This is important because I have been to restaurants that are not handicap accessible.   Lets get down to the nitty gritty and talk about the food. Keep in mind the brunch menu does change, so if you see something you want do not wait because it might not be there. My friends and I had brunch here this past weekend. The roof top is first come first serve, no need for reservations. I ordered a peach bellini ($9) and the pork shoulder hash ($14) which included eggs, toast, asparagus, portobello mushrooms and fingerling potatoes. I was slightly disappointed in my dish. Only because the pork was EXTREMELY fatty and I hate fat. My friend ordered the same thing and hers had no fat on it. Hers also seemed to be cooked more thoroughly than mine. Needless to say I left a skillet filled with pork for our waitress to take back. The other ingredients were extremely tasty on their own without the pork so I scarfed them down instead. I also would like to comment on the fact that their drinks are pretty pricey. A bellini is pretty basic and comes in a tiny champagne glass; charging $9 seems a bit much. If you want to get your money's worth and enjoy boozy drinks, head over to The Urban Tap for their mimosa flights."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Six Penn I'm always surprised the food isn't BETTER than what I had just had.  It's time to face the truth:  this is a lovely and semi swanky restaurant, but the food is not great.  The food is average restaurant food served with a beautiful presentation.  It's over priced but I feel the nice atmosphere kind of evens the pricing out.  Don't even think about coming here during the lunch hour without a reservation.  I'd also recommend letting your server know if you only have an hour for lunch.  It took so long for my chicken breast to come out that I had to get in a to go box and leave.  I do not recommend ordering the grilled chicken breast with pierogies.  Pierogies are ALWAYS good but there were only two of them.  The chicken breast was dry.  Total let down."}
{"text":"Dined at SIx Penn on light up night.  Service was great and the food was very good.  Was disappointed to see veal on the menu. Veal is cruel and should not be on any menu.  Baby cows are confined to extremely confined cages and become anemic to only be slaughtered after a horrific short life.  Definitely, no one at our table ordered veal!"}
{"text":"Very sad to see Six Penn go.. I have been to lunch and happy hour numerous times, I was never over impressed until this past weekend. We had a gift certificate to use, so decided to go for dinner. Everything about the experience was awesome. Sarah the  hostess helped find two extra seats for our friends that were a last minute addition. Our server, Kristen was above and beyond fantastic with her service. We hope to follow her wherever she ends up. Our entree choice was the pork shank, and it was so good, we will definitely be back before they close next month. If your're thinking about giving them a chance before they are gone, I recommend it! Still haven't heard a good reason as to why they are really closing..."}
{"text":"This is a solid lunch spot, but sometimes it's best to have a reservation. Luckily, they use OpenTable, so you can earn some points.   Their specials are usually pretty good, but my favorite here is the Caesar salad with shrimp. It comes with a few anchovies - you can always have them leave these out, but then we may not be friends anymore.   I've also enjoyed the pizzas here.   I'm only rating Six Penn at 3 stars because it's a tad overpriced and because needing a reservation at lunch is kind of annoying. However, if can you plan ahead, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"SixPenn Pittsburgh,PA Appetizers: calamari & rock shrimp r no joke no brainer. Artisanal cheeses along with mouth watering pickled veggies but the dark cherries soaked in sweet vermouth & cinnamon, luscious sensuous, orgasmic. Need I say more? Stay tuned...I'm opinionated! Follow me if U dare."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed by the brunch my friends and I had here. We came in without a reservation with no trouble and were seated in a cushy booth by the window. The space has a modern, trendy look to it but remains cozy and welcoming. I really liked it.  Though it was a bit after 1pm, I still felt compelled to do the brunch cocktail thing so I went with a mimosa http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P4lfCI0WSaVoA2VFdsZRiQ?select=drPh-SgVhCtKaI_C-Rr15g . It was surprisingly not very cold but I enjoyed it anyway.  Our meal was kick-started with a basket of brunch breads - apple bread and raspberry-chocolate scones http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P4lfCI0WSaVoA2VFdsZRiQ?select=j80Rf8c5B-Ke1UTRmZgA4w . They were awesome.   Our server was very pleasant and made some excellent recommendations upon our request. Since one of my friends was realllly hungry, she recommended the breakfast quesadilla because it is very filling. As for her favorite dish, she recommended the Tempura-Fried Bacon BLT.  Tempura-Fried Bacon BLT: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P4lfCI0WSaVoA2VFdsZRiQ?select=DWIVhUSb1UtwM66BNSwBHA Breakfast Quesadilla: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P4lfCI0WSaVoA2VFdsZRiQ?select=DWIVhUSb1UtwM66BNSwBHA Boston Cream Beignets: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P4lfCI0WSaVoA2VFdsZRiQ?select=X4SmYg6HKxEQJvSQnm8Ivg Burger: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P4lfCI0WSaVoA2VFdsZRiQ?select=JHteAM0pMDynO_AE8WBuPA  One of my friends also had a side of the mac and cheese (not pictured).   I ordered the burger and found it to be quite good. It was a little bit overcooked as I had asked for it medium and it was more like well-done but I'm not one to make a big fuss. The potatoes that accompanied the burger were well cooked and the sriracha drizzle added just enough kick.  My friend was totally owned by the breakfast quesadilla. He loved every bite but wasn't able to finish. We all loved the Boston cream beignets. Though my other friend enjoyed her BLT, she found the tempura breading on the bacon to be too overwhelming. After sampling a piece of the bacon, I totally understood. It was way too bread-y.   I would totally come to Six Penn for another meal - like lunch or dinner. I'm a big fan of restaurants who use produce from local and sustainable farmers and was pleasantly surprised to see they buy their lamb from Jamison Farm! Jamison Farm happens to be one of the farmers that comes to the Bethesda (Maryland) Farmer's Market and sell world-class certified humane lamb. Huge huge points for that.   When you visit Six Penn Kitchen, you can expect attentive, unfussy service with delicious food at quite reasonable prices. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This was without question the worst brunch we have ever had.  It was off to a bad start when it took over 30 minutes to get a $6 biscuit that was burnt.  It ended up taking our table of seven over an hour for us to get our food.  Neighboring tables (including a table of 6) received their food well before we did despite being seated after we had already ordered.  Once the food arrived, I wish that it hadn't.  A very simple plate with effectively just eggs and potatoes was dreadful.  The eggs were overcooked and the food had obviously been sitting out for quite a while, because the food was cold (not just \"not hot\").  Unfortunately since the food came so late, we didn't have time to even bother with the sending-it-back drill, and candidly the food was so bad, we didn't have any interest in trying again.  The rest of my table didn't have much more luck either.  I'd strongly recommend going somewhere else if you're visiting town."}
{"text":"I have been there before, and had a much better experience this time but I still cannot give it more than three stars.  I just am not that impressed overall.  The service was great, she was both knowledgeable and attentive and helped guide as as far as what she thinks the best items are.  This being our first time there for brunch, it was helpful.  She was right about the Beignets!  YUMMO!  Amazing.  So light and fluffy and the cream was amazing.  My husband seemed to like the deviled eggs (with Ham in honor of the Easter holiday I presume).  He got the Angel food cake french toast with Strawberry cheesecake filling (looked good but too sweet for me) and I got the basic Keystone breakfast.  All good.   The tempura fried bacon was interesting... good though.    Not going to be a spot that we will frequent, but I think it is good.  I just think there are a lot of other options worth exploring in town."}
{"text":"Okay I read the reviews and went to to have a bit for dinner. The prices where out of control in my opinion. I had a bowl of soup that tasted okay.... had a 9 dollar glass of sub par wine and left."}
{"text":"Six Penn Kitchen is just ok for me.  For whatever reason, I'm almost indifferent when it comes to dining out here.  I don't crave it but I do end up here on occassion for lunch because I work downtown.  The menu has a lot of comfort foods on it but for some reason, not a lot of the choices on their menu even interest me.  My go to favorite is the Buffalo Chicken Macaroni and Cheese.  It's the perfect mix of spice and creamy cheese and chicken and not over the top spicy.  It's the only item that I've really enjoyed on the menu.  Everything else is good but nothing really blew my mind.  The lobster mac and cheese was actually a let down.    The service is good: not great, not terrible and the atmosphere is nice.  They have a great open deck area upstairs but unfortunately it's very small and there is limited seating so it doesn't live up to it's full potential."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a try.  I'm eternally grateful for that decision.  My friend and I got right in without a reservation and our server immediately greeted us with water and a smile.  Bread and drinks followed promptly after.      At the recommendation of previous reviewers, I ordered the Buffalo Mac n Cheese.  Oh.my.goodness.   These guys know what they're doing.   I'm not a big fan of the buffalo taste but blended with the cheese and chicken, it was fantastic!   *warning-this dish is not for the calorie counters*.   The cheese was creamy and had a great tang, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and the chicken was nice and tender.  The atmosphere is nice and open yet it was a little loud.  I had to shout at my friend a couple of times.  However, I would still come back for that Mac n Cheese."}
{"text":"I loved this place.   I've been here twice and first got the lamb bolognese and later got the crab and lobster risotto- both dishes were amazing. So flavorful and well prepared, I would say one of the best places I've been to in Pittsburgh.  My boyfriend got the seared duck and he too loved his dish (he got it cooked rare instead of the usual medium). Great flavors and a wonderful atmosphere- this is a great place for a nice date.  I also got the calamari which was great, but I would say to steer away from the salads- nothing too special (or good for that matter). I've had two different types of salad and I would say that you are better off sticking with other appetizers (or the soup)  Using local produce to support local farmers, I appreciate Six Penn Kitchen even MORE- what a great place!  I would definitely recommend this place.  The Almost Arnie is also the best cocktail ever- I usually don't drink (i hate the taste of alcohol, and am a huge lightweight) but this drink is unresistable!!!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We shared a number of small plates and each was delicious but the polenta with mushrooms and the smoky fingerling potatoes were the best. Try the strawberry basil mojito!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is the rooftop seating! It is first come first served and the space is not very big but it's so nice to eat/drink outside and not feel like you are part of the traffic.   The food is good but not anything I crave. The taco appetizers were delicious. The entree buffalo mac and cheese is good but the side of Mac was a little bland.   I also like the drink selection here. A nice variety of beers and great mix drinks."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place several times and wondered about it- exterior was interesting enough to catch my eye. Place actually had the fee of an older steakhouse. Service was decent. All of the food I tasted was excellent- fried octopus, a water melon salad, and samples from two different cuts of steak. Steak was actually amazing. Beer selection was reasonable but not extravagant...better than average bar of course. Lighting was a little dark..seems like a good place to take your family (parents I mean, didn't really seem geared towards families with children). Business casual dress at least."}
{"text":"The service was a real downer. We had a party of about ten and our waiter was having a little trouble handling everything. We waited about 45 minutes for our cocktails to come out. Several times throughout the night, we would look over at the service area and our food had been sitting there for 10-15 minutes before It was brought to us. Had high hopes for this place because It came highly recommended. Food was decent. 2 stars instead of 1 because my gimlet was pretty solid."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice before heading over to the Benedum for a show.  Both experiences were fantastic with great service, tasty food and happy taste buds.  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because I do feel it is pricey compared to other high end restaurants in the area.  On our first visit, we arrived without reservations.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but they treated us with respect and, thankfully, had several tables available.  The server asked at the beginning of our meal if we had theater tickets because they wanted to ensure that we dined with enough time to still get to the theater.   We started the meal with a bottle of Moscato that was very tasty.  My fiance tried the french onion soup and I had the beet salad.  Both were exceptional.  Entrees were the buffalo mac and cheese and one of the nightly specials.  Again, both were flavorful and had portions that were actually filling.    Even though the entire meal was appealing, the highlight for me was the \"carnival\" dessert.  You can't go wrong with a treat that features cotton candy, whoopie pies, cracker jacks and other special treats.  It made me smile just looking at it and the grin only continued to grow as I ate the various treats.  The only down side was the crazy sugar rush.  The second time we tried Six Penn was during Restaurant Week.   Same great service and same great food.  The shrimp bisque was tasty (although I found it to be a little salty).  The fillet that came with the \"surf and turf\" was so tender it literally melted in my mouth.  MMMMM.  They even made one of my least favorite vegetables, Brussels sprouts, tasty!  The crab cake was delicious, too.  Although some may not like it because it is actually made out of a lot of crab compared to the crab cakes at most other places that are mostly breading.  They once again nailed the dessert.  It was a peanut butter cheesecake that was mind blowing.  Creamy, tasty, sweet.  MMMM.  I almost ordered a piece to go so I could have some the next day.  I enjoy Six Penn, but with the high price tag, it will have to remain someplace that I visit for only an occasional treat."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch before the steelers game with a few friends. I had an omelette and my friend had scrambled eggs with toast potatoes sausage and bacon and we tried the donut. The donut was not cooked , literally not cooked at all. We asked for butter and other condiments  and he never returned with them. He was basically nonexistent. Also, everything was extremely salty! Don't eat the potatoes, they made me sick. This was my second experience here and I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've only gone to the rooftop bar happy hour at Six Penn and if you can score one of the two tents up there with comfy couch seating, then you're golden. They have decent cocktails and a slew of unhealthy but yummy appetizers. The service was a bit uneven, but it was a gorgeous late afternoon well spent. Be aware that traffic and parking might be issues in downtown Pittsburgh, especially if there's a game going on. I parked at the $8 garage across the street and I'm glad I did because afterwards, I got to see the game end fireworks from the parking garage which turns out to be a perfect vantage point, especially from the roof of the garage."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner!  Came to town to visit and stopped by Point State Park before wandering around town looking for a fun place to dine.  It started pouring as we were considering eating there so we kind of had no choice but to get out of the rain. Staff is very friendly.  I don't know what these other people are talkin about the staff being rude.  Ordered the soup of the day (roasted red pepper and corn bisque with bacon and scallions) and it was amazing!  My drink was a cherry cayenne sour and had a very uniquely spicy flavor. Crackling pork shank for dinner was huge and accompanied by bacon sauerkraut mashed and a delicious apple purée.  Individual apple pie for dessert.  Yum!  They use local meats and produce which makes a huge difference.  Entire meal with drinks, apps and dessert came to $70 for two people.  Six Penn is a must try!"}
{"text":"The KimChee bowl...please take off menu.  As a half Korean I was sorely disappointed...and the shrimp \"etouffe\" was no where close. I dropped $80 here and expected much more."}
{"text":"Great presentation. Great service. Atmosphere very sophisticated.  The food was bland. Everything was WAY overpriced.  Other reviews stated that the restaurant was casual. It is far from casual. You go best dressed or you stick out like a sore thumb...trust me."}
{"text":"We kept on coming back here because it is so very convenient as a post-concert hangout. My dining experience there, sadly, has declined further.   The menu still attempts to lure you in with intriguing descriptions of ingredients and preparations that demand a more competent chef than whom they have. More unsatisfying, though is their recent tendency to cut corners and short change you. To wit:  1. The bread \"basket\" is now a thin slice of bread the size of a 3\"x5\" index card for each diner. Sure, you can ask for more, but they will only dole out another measly \"basket\"... whenever they get around to it.  2. I ordered a salad that was described as \"baby oak leaves with gorgonzola, bosc pear, and walnuts.\" The first time it arrived, there was no cheese or nuts, just a lot of leaves and one slice of pear. The second time around, I got a slightly smaller mound of leaves with the missing cheese and nuts, but the one actual slice of pear has now been reduced to two end pieces -- pear skins the size of quarters.   3. Because the menu had slim vegetarian pickings, my companion asked for the vegetable and pasta sides from their short rib dish. At the end of the meal, we were unpleasantly surprised to find that she has been charged for the full price of the meat dish. The kitchen's response \"we gave her more pasta to make up the difference.\"  Because our table ordered both the meat version and the meatless version, we could see that the meatless version didn't have *that* much more pasta. Per ounce, that might have been the most expensive bit of pasta in all of greater Pittsburgh.  In summary, Six Penn is not the worst place to grab a bite if you are already in the cultural district, but you have to be willing to overpay for a so-so experience."}
{"text":"I had never been to Six Penn before I came for a Yelp Elite event. From the very beginning, the staff set the mood of the evening. We were greeted with champagne as we took our seats. There were wine glasses that corresponded with every one of the 7-courses. The manager came out for every course and explained the dish and the wine pairing, as well as why the dish was chosen.  The first course was chicken consomme. The broth was light, as it should be. The vegetables were not too soft or too firm. The second-course was tartare. I was nervous about eating tartare but it was delicious. The plate was presented beautifully. The third-course was foie gras, chicken I believe. It was my first time having it and another item I was nervous about, but it was delicious. It tasted like meat, but just soft. It had a nice char to it that gave it another layer of flavor. The fourth course was a braised shoulder and chop of lamb. It was paired with a fantastic lentil dish. For dessert, we had a unique dessert that had pistachios, a berry sauce, and a globe made up of something that was delicious but I don't actually remember what it was made of.  The decor is somewhat upscale, so I wouldn't come here in jeans and a T-shirt. I would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on National Martini Day. Ordered \"Meg's Martini\" referenced in an e-mail newsletter from 6 Penn. Don't ever do that. Weak, flavorless, uninspiring. Does a great disservice to the holiday.  FOOD! Now we're talking artistic presentations. Excellent bread. Yummy, creative appetizers. Different. Delicious. My wife's suggestion for our next visit: a couple of appetizers and a shared bottle of wine. The selections were that good.   Lamb shank and trout. Both were first rate. No little, prissy plates with two bites of food. Real Pittsburgh size meals. Trout was big, flavorful and displayed on the platter unlike any trout I have ever seen. Usually a flat, dried out piece of fish lays on the plate in a visually boring way. Not at 6 Penn. Order the trout. You will be pleasantly surprised. Better be hungry!  Lamb shank must be a signature dish. At the end of her dinner, my wife did actually leave the bone on the plate. Everything else was gone! 6 Penn has an excellent kitchen: empty plates prove that.  Service was very good. Good range of prices on a somewhat obscure wine list. Restaurant is noisy... echos a lot.  For downtown restaurant visitors, we feel that our experience at 6 Penn was much better than our visit to Elements. Better service. Better food.   We're going back for the appetizers and wine!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch here! My bf and I  started with a tasty Bloody Mary and mimosa. We thought so much sounded great, so we decided to order one smoked salmon crepe and a poached egg which was topped with the spicy Bloody Mary mix and was served with popcorn grits. I've never had anything like these grits, they really taste like popcorn, something I'm not fond of, but the flavor worked in this dish. And the creamy seafood crepe was delicious as well, we couldn't decide which was better. I'd definitely come back if I lived in pittsburgh, it made for a great Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I enjoy outside dining wherever it's available.  It's even more fabulous when you have the opportunity to sit atop of a high rise building in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh.  Seating here is first- come, first- serve, and you seat yourself.  A fun place to go before attending any of the shows in the cultural district.  Plenty of good drink and food options.  However, I must mention that my last visit became a bit puzzling when the server kept announcing it was going to rain.  This phrase was repeated at least 5 times during our visit. My friend and I ordered our drinks and asked to see a food menu.  His first response was :\" It's going to rain\".    The menus were delivered, and he re-affirmed that it was going to rain.  Mind you, the rooftop was filled with other patrons.  I finally replied that if it rains we will go inside.  He replied that our tab would not transfer to the inside.  He left and came back for our order and then announced that the latest radar shows a rain storm moving in.  I finally said we will use an umbrella if we need to!  Our order was placed, an updated weather report was given, and before we knew it, our food was delivered  within a timely fashion.  We were very pleased with the presentation and taste of our food, along with the fact that we no longer had to worry or hear about the latest forecast. (By the way, the rain never appeared during our meal, but did so much later in the evening.)  Six Penn will still be on my list as the place to go for outside dining anytime I am attending a show, however, I might make sure there isn't a cloud or two in the sky before choosing to do so."}
{"text":"It seems that this place may have been better in the past based on friends' experiences.  I went as part of a work party.  There was a set menu that seemed promising.  The caesar salad was fantastic although I was not given the option to hold the whole anchovies, which is standard operating protocol at any American restaurant that serves it with anchovies.  But moving along, the salmon was lackluster and the portion miniscule.  The saving grace was the delicious and refreshing gin drink, which uses wigle whiskey's ginever, which is the only reason for 2 stars.  The cranberry bread pudding for desert was a small portion (and I appreciate small portions usually) and overcooked. Lastly, parking is partially comped, which for an expensive restaurant in a city with already cheap parking should be free especially considering it was self-park and not valet. I can't see any reason to return."}
{"text":"I must admit I was disappointed! I made reservations to celebrate our anniversary.  I made them aware was a special night when I called.  When we arrived we were seated promptly.  The food was decent, the atmosphere loud and dark as expected-- we enjoyed being by the kitchen. The server was nice but didn't seem interested in making the night special for us. I felt like his opinion was \"it is all good\" rather than \"this particular meal is amazing!\" He didn't acknowledge our anniversary-- or ask if we wanted dessert at the end of our meal.    We asked if we could have a drink at the rooftop and he informed us we couldn't have service up there... We went up and it was empty.  It was a little bit of a downer! The meals (prime rib and lamb bolognese pasta) were good but we agreed nothing made us want to go back other than location and roof top (closed) bar!  I would love to tell you about our amazing drinks and dessert, but I can't. There are soooo many amazing Pittsburgh restaurants... I would say head down Sixth Avenue and find another one!"}
{"text":"None of us were really hungry when we ended up here.  We were trying to kill time and pretty much just had drinks and appetizers (buffalo chicken macaroni, short ribs), but what we had was pretty good.  We were seated immediately, our waitress was friendly and attentive, and the decor was nice.  Some of the customers were dressed, others wearing Steelers jerseys.  A nice, unpretentious spot that I'd go to again."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on New Years Eve.  We were passing through Pittsburgh for the night and didn't want a fancy dinner or to spend a ton on a \"special\" menu.  Six Penn served their regular menu and had some specials. But they didn't seem to jack up prices for NYE. We started with the house made pretzels and they were excellent.  I had the short ribs for my entree and they were very good.  They have a good wine selection. Overall an enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The menu is a twist on regular food, I can't get enough of the buffalo mac and cheese, and the pork shank.  Nice, modern atmosphere, convenient to the downtown cultural district, and reasonably priced. The only thing I wish they had was good bread.  The bread there is baked there, but it's not good."}
{"text":"After traveling most of the day, via plane, for work, you want to find a good place to have your first meal in the city. Although some downtown digs in cities across the country can come across too pretentious or too hole in the wall (not if there isn't awesome food at both extremes), Six Penn Kitchen is a great balance to that - did I mention a roof to bar with late night happy hour?  The locally grown food was great. My coworkers had a variety of things that were all great. We all started off with a mixed salad with a Dijon herb vinaigrette that was light and fresh. My thick cut pork chop over molasses beans and sautéed string beans were very tasty. The bbq chicken was a huge portion and the burger was a solid choice. The aroma of the cedar planks and wood chips grilling permeated throughout the restaurant, leaving you to ask, \"What's on the grill?\"  Even better was the after dinner drinks on the roof top. Although small, the roof top bar had a mix of bench and cushioned seating. The happy hour specials on well drinks, domestics, and wine went through the night - 9-11pm.   Best Highlight: Locally grown products in all their food.  Low point: The rooftop bar isn't as big as one would hope, but this isn't the Standard in LA."}
{"text":"Pork shank is incredible, mashed potatoes with sauerkraut and bacon below. Service was mediocre, that's why they fell short of 5 stars...cool restaurant."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars Atmosphere: 3 stars Service: 1 star  We came here on a Tuesday night after seeing the PSO across the road. Already full on hors d'oeuvres, we decided to finish the night with some dessert.  I wish we hadn't gone. The waitress kept on ignoring our table. We finally got to order after sitting there for fifteen minutes. When we told her we wanted the dessert menu, she gave us a look. Finally, she split the bill wrong and didn't bother to check up on us.  As for the desserts, they were truly lackluster. Presentation is a 3.5, but the taste is more like a 2. Everything tasted unidimensional: sweet, or creamy, or revolting. Nothing stood out to me, and you'd imagine something would at an average price of $7 per dessert. For reference, we had the cheesecake, the special (a poor rendition of smores), and the apple thing (texture was way off, and lukewarm).  Don't go."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch and for drinks.  I've enjoyed the experience overall.  I will say that I only get 1-2 drinks here for happy hour and then usually head somewhere else a little bit more affordable and jumping.    As for lunch, I absolutely love and highly recommend the \"Lo mein noodle salad, crispy vegetable spring roll, bean sprouts; peanut hoisin sauce\" - the noodles are cold so don't be surprised.  If you like Asian inspired food, then you'll probably enjoy this dish.  Every time that I go for lunch, this is my go to dish.  I've had some of the other stuff, but the fact that I can't remember what they were should be telling enough.    It's not a bad place to check out, but it's not top on my list for food or drinks overall."}
{"text":"This was my last meal in Pittsburgh...and it happens to be the 2nd best meal I had in 7 days.  I ordered the pork loin.... But that was only 1part of pork three way.  There was a mini pork pot pie and fried pork belly.  It was pure pork heaven.  The only portion that was just OK was the pork pie.     We also ordered the pretzel bites...come on, I come all the way to Pittsburgh and don't do pretzel... The  cheesy dipping sauce was the way to go.    The only bad thing was the downstairs men's room.  There was only a toilet.  The room smells clean, but the trash can needed emptying and paper towels picked up from the floor.  This is the reason I only have 4 stars... I wish I could do 4.5"}
{"text":"Six Penn is a fun place. A very good place to drink and a pretty good place to eat.  First off, the place is very cool and the menu has some great options. I loved the appetizers and also liked the the cocktails. My pork dish was pretty darn salty and the side dishes were also a little heavy on the sodium.  Overall, good place to eat downtown. Would love to have the chef read this...."}
{"text":"This review is purely for the Jamison Farm Lamb Bolognese with Pappardelle, Feta, and Roasted Tomato's.  Even as I write this I am slightly embarrassed. I was in Pittsburgh for all of 6 days and I went here not once, but twice. It was so good! I got the Jamison Farm Lamb Bolognese BOTH times. Lamb was so tender and had great flavor. I am not sure why there was \"potato chips\" on top of the dish but they were wonderful too. If I had found this place earlier I hate to say I may have returned again for fear I would never get to eat this wonderful meal again. This was my first trip to Pittsburgh and i didn't know when I would be returning.   I sat a the bar both times so I cannot speak for the service at the tables. Bartender was friendly but more interested in some sports event on TV. Which was fine I guess.Nice Wine list to select from. Large windows to look out to the people walking by.   Would definitely recommend checking this place out in your in town."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Our group of 3 decided to tryout their rooftop dining on a nice sunny summer day. We ordered: tilapia special, short rub meat loaf, fish and chips, mojito, whiskey mule  Everything was amazing and the service from Mark was right up there too. He was attentive and friendly. he filled us in on the happy hour and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I was on a business trip and didn't have much to do while I was in Pittsburgh. I absolutely love mac and cheese so I heard this place had one of the best and I thought I would try it out. It was freezing when I walked from my hotel to the restaurant so I wasn't exactly happy when I arrived. But the service was absolutely terrible. I sat in the bar since I was by myself. I asked for beer and was rudely given an answer like I knew nothing about what to drink. I knew exactly what I wanted to eat so I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Mac and Cheese right away. It didn't take long to get it and it was actually really good but spicy and it took me a couple times to ask my server for water and I asked for more bread (to cool my taste buds) and never got it. They were so eager to get me out of there they brought the check right away. The food was great. Beer was good but service and atmosphere was terrible. I ventured out in the cold and just wanted to sit and relax but I ended up being rushed out. I wouldn't go back, maybe only for take-out."}
{"text":"I have been to six penn multiple times and normally its good food and ok service. However this past Friday service was absolutely terrible they messed up multiple orders and the food wasnt even good. I tried the summer bbq and everything was overcooked. The ribs had next to no meat. I will have to say if you are going to give this place a try go for the cracklin pork shank. Now for the service, it is some of the worst we have ever experienced. They messed up orders and we couldn't even get the waiter's attention to tell him that he gave us the wrong thing. Instead of removing the item from our bill he only reduced the item by 50%. All and all the food isn't terrible, however for the price I expect better quality and service. I have had similar, if not better tasting food at other new up and coming spots in Pittsburgh. Unless they make some major changes to service levels we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Sunday for Brunch with my girlfriend and two of her friends that were in from Baltimore.  The restaurant was busy whenever we got there and we were asked if we minded sitting on the rooftop under a shaded area which we did not.  Upon getting to the rooftop we were escorted to a little cabana type shelter which provided ample shade to our group.  It was originally comfortable but with the temperatures climbing into the 90's on this day, it was hot by the end of our meal.  The set up of the cabana was also more conducive to having cocktails than eating a full brunch as it was sans table or anything high enough to comfortably eat off of while sitting down.  Our group decided to start off our brunch by ordering the boston cream beignets.  They came out failrly quickly and were plated nicely with lots of chocolate and cream.  I was not too big a fan of the taste though.  It's not that they were bad but they were not nearly as good as the ones that I have had in New Orleans.  For my entree I decided upon the frittata with lemon aoili and pickle salad while also ordering a side of tempura bacon for our table to share.  The first bite of my frittata was awesome as it had some pickle, artichoke and aioli which gave a nice tartness to it.  I would have to say that the base frittata by itself was not that impressive but the lemon aioli really gave it a boost that I enjoyed.  The bacon came out looking as expecting with a layer of tempura covering it.  Since I am a bacon lover I thought that I would thoroughly enjoy it but this dish was a big whiff for me.  Don't get me wrong, bacon is always greasy, but this took it to a new level of greasiness and sadly the tempura batter did little to improve on the flavor.  I should also note that our waitress was pleasant and gave us excellent customer service.  One of my dining companions was pregnant and ordered the heuvos rancheros without knowing that there would be sunny side up eggs on it.  After she realized her mistake, she asked the waitress if she could have the eggs cooked more.  Sadly, whenever the plate was brought up to us again, the eggs were still runny.  Immediately upon noticing this, the waitress apologized and told us that she would take that meal off of our check.   The bottom line for me is that I might head back here in the future.  It wouldn't be my top choice to go for brunch in the city as some of the food was good and others parts not so good, but my frittata showed me that their is a potential for their other dishes to be good as well."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am picky! I will leave a place if I dont like the vibe, this was in fact the 4th place I walked into this evening. I dont mind spending money on a great meal, but I want a place that is worth it. This place went above and beyond my expectations!!  The atmosphere: perfect. I like a large, lofty, open area that is upscale but casual at the same time, no stuffiness, modern. It was great. We had a great big booth, nice wood table, next to big window. Beautiful bar. Good lighting, high ceilings.   The bread basket was some of the best bread I'd ever had, the cocktails were nice, nice mix on the menu. I had the rib eye and bf had the short ribs...both cooked to perfection. Homemade mac and cheese and mashed potatoes as sides...you get the theme, comfort food. Simple food done perfect. Great menu, classic dishes done the right way.   Dessert options were large, fun options, cotton candy, apple pie, sorbet..we had the waffle with maple ice cream, fantastic!  Great service, professional, but not stuffy..very personable.   Now I am going to compare every place I go to this place, because it had everything I want.....relaxing, clean, modern atmosphere, great food and drinks, and amazing service. Very very pleased."}
{"text":"So disappointing!! I've eaten at Six Penn many times for dinner. Thought we'd try it for breakfast. We sat on the rooftop and were forgotten about! Had to go find someone to refill our coffee. Was very disappointed in what I had ordered. When the waiter finally showed up to clear plates and noticed my plate still very much full, he only asked if I wanted a box not if there was a problem with my meal. Actually asked an other server for an order of toast because my breakfast was not what I expected --was surprised our server wasn't immediately sent to our table. When we left the restaurant the hostess was leaning over hostess stand chatting with a server and never broke to say goodbye. Not what I'd expect for a $40 breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Place is conveniently located with a nice ambiance. The crowd is generally older, but it keeps the restaurant at a nice volume. The food was decently priced. I've been their twice with a friend. Our two trips there allowed us to try all the little meat groups, the fish, chicken, beef, and pork. All the dishes were cooked to perfection. Nothing amazing but definitely delicious."}
{"text":"Decided to stop at Six Penn kitchen before they closed. The food was good and service was upbeat. It's a shame we're going to lose this restaurant in downtown"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here this past week. Just down the street from the Pittsburgh Renaissance Hotel where I was staying.  Got a table for one. Looked over the menu and decided on the wood fired meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy, and asparagus. Plus water.  They serve your water in these cool little old fashioned style milk bottles (see attached pix). They pour some water for you into your glass and then leave you with extra water in the bottle - I loved this touch!  The place was really hopping when I arrived - very busy! Took about 15 minutes for my food to come up.  When the dish arrived (see attached pix), it was a very nice presentation of a basic meat and potatoes meal. I tasted the meatloaf first - it was absolutely delish and amazing! It had a wonderful richness and savory aspect to it - and yet was not heavy - in fact it had a lightness to it. In stark contrast to the really *heavy* dense meatloaf I had at the Landmark Diner in Atlanta earlier in the week.  The gravy and mashed potatoes were also very good. The Asparagus tasted like it was lightly steamed.  Service was good and I really like this restaurant. There is a second level upstairs which I did not see - and apparently a roof deck area that is some times open in the evenings for the enjoyment of beverages."}
{"text":"Was treated very rudely at the bar & pretty much ignored when it was not even busy. I've worked in the restaurant industry before & know how it works. They were too busy talking to each other then taking care of customers. Also asked my friend's tab to be separated & it never happened. Was so frustrated with the whole situation my boyfriend paid the over $100 tab in full. He did not want to tip because of the treatment we received, but from being in the industry I made him leave 10%. They missed out on some very good patrons & tippers!"}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes until our server came over.  My pork chop was raw.  My colleagues steak was good but everything else on the plate was disgusting.  The crepe clearly just came out of a refrigerator and was not fresh.    Our server was really nice and explained the mix up at the beginning.  She took the pork off the bill...  She felt bad and did a good job for us.   I won't be back most likely."}
{"text":"It had been a few years since I went to Six Penn, but we decided to give their brunch a shot on Easter Sunday. The overall feeling that we had walking away was that we weren't let down, but we also weren't going to be itching to go back.  The service was excellent. In fact, I think our server's attitude, personality, and helpfulness was the best part of the experience, by far.  Our group of four ordered quite a few things off of their brunch menu in order to taste as much as we could. The apps we ordered were decent. The beignets were really good. The boston cream \"filling\" that they put on the bottom of the plate and rested the beignets on was somewhat plain, but when paired with the beignets, became a nice, complementing texture.   The deviled eggs had ham in them, and while the saltiness reminded me of deviled eggs with olives in the mix or garnish, I thought the ham was too overwhelming. The saltiness was a little too much after the first couple of bites. I think the ham component was an Easter Sunday-only thing, so it might not always be an issue.  I ordered the angel food french toast, and while I LOVE sweet stuff for breakfast, I was left underwhelmed by my meal. It looked great on arrival, but in the end, the flavors just came together as one unfulfilling flavor that left me saying to myself that \"it just wasn't worth the calories.\" I liked the airiness of the angel food cake that they used for french toast, but I would've preferred more flavor as opposed to the textural experiment of the light cake, seedy fruits, whipped cream and the warm creamy cheesecake filling they used.  We also ordered the tempura bacon and home fries on the side. The home fries were excellent. They were cooked perfectly, not greasy, and the small bits of bacon included were a nice flavor addition. The tempura bacon was such an awesome idea, but, in the end, their fluffy tempura batter took over and the bacon flavor was too subtle.  Overall, Six Penn left the same impression that it always had when I went in the past. It's a slightly overpriced restaurant with a unique menu consisting of truly interesting ideas that never quite hit the spot. Will I go back? Sure, but with so many other restaurants in the city, I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"My bf and I stopped here for a quick drink  (or two) and a snack prior to seeing Boeing Boeing this past weekend at the cabaret. After attempting to have cocktails at Butcher and the Rye, which was already fully packed by 6pm this past Saturday, we decided to give Six Penn Kitchen a try and, boy, am I glad we did! Although we only ordered the charcuterie and cheese plate, which was tasty, the drinks here are really what caught me by surprise! We sat at the bar, which was near empty when we arrived but was completely occupied by the time we left for our show, and had friendly service, in general. The male bartender-I wish I had caught his name- was much friendlier than the female bartender, and coincidentally, each round of drinks we had was made by a different bartender and our second round, made by the male bartender, was much tastier (and stronger!), than the first round. Anywho....I chose to indulge in the Tennessee Treat (Jack Daniels, pear liqueur, Blackberry shrub and rhubarb bitters) and my bf chose the Six Penn Sangria with pinot noir. Both drinks were excellent! So excellent I had to stop at two or I would have indulged in a third :) The charcuterie and cheese plate came with smoked mozzerella, brie, and havrati (I think), along with pork liver mousse, mortadella, and pancetta. There were also olives and crostini on the plate. I will return and sample actual meals but I'm glad I have another place to add to my repertoire of downtown drink/snack destinations before seeing any of the shows in the cultural district!"}
{"text":"Wow. My boyfriend and I stopped in around 3:00 just to get a quick bite to eat...and we had a very pleasant experience. First, the wait staff was very polite...initially greeting us...however we decided to just take a seat at the bar. Both bartenders were very nice and helped us with making our food selection. We decided on the SPK burger and the Pork Shank. Not only was my well done burger still juicy and cooked wonderfully, but the pork shank is BY FAR the best pork we've ever tasted. Perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were fantastic. To top it off, having Johnnie Walker Blue made the experience even better.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a great meal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has mediocre reviews.I was pleasantly surprised and satisfield with my dining experience. The service was on-point! My colleague and I ordered an appetizer, split a salad and our entrees. Each course was timed perfectly! We didn't have to wait and we weren't rushed either. We started with the homemade pretzels with mustard and beer cheese dip. The beer cheese dip was delicious!! I wish I could have brought some home with me! The caesar salad was also wonderful! My gnocchi was a little mushy for my liking but the flavor was good. Overall, I would give this place a solid B!"}
{"text":"I've been to Six Penn Kitchen many times for different things and I have to say I've never had a bad experience whether it's dinner, a Yelp event, brunch, or happy hour. I can't write a review about every little thing I've ever had here but I can tell you everything has been amazing. The only dish I wasn't super impressed with was the Caesar salad because I think it was lacking dressing. Other then that everything has been phenomenal. I think one of my favorites by far was my recent brunch experience. I love their little rooftop and they have some really good drink options. Some of which I haven't seen many other places. I would highly recommend it the eggs Benedict.   I think Six Penn Kitchen is great for so many things. A nice relaxing brunch with friends, a celebratory dinner, a little happy hour, dinner before a show, etc. I don't believe they have happy hour specials so it's definitely not the place to go if you want cheap drinks after work."}
{"text":"For a $150 meal for two, it was not worth it in any way.  The scallops (2) appetizer with a semi-creme corn and pancetta was well-prepared with subtle tastes.  The Caprese was tasty with a whipped mustard-creme over it.  They split that for us at no additional charge.  The rest of the meal was not good.  The crab cakes...pasty, pureed, tasteless.  For a $28 entree there wasn't one chunky bit of crab anywhere.  It didn't even taste of crab.  The bulgar wheat as an accompaniment had more flavor. I didn't even eat half of one crab cake.  There were two.  Obviously the chef is not having the bussers make him aware of plates that are left so full of food.  The Pork Chop was huge but over-brined.  I get that they want to cook a pork chop medium rare.  The one we got was translucent through a large part of it.  We got the mac n' cheese as a side which was comped because the waiter forgot it and brought it later, but there was not even a hint of cheese!!!!  It was just a creme sauce, with some bread crumbs on top.  The pasta was cooked well.  The service was ok.    It is very, very loud.  The open kitchen concept doesn't add anything to the experience as you can't see them cook anything, you just hear things banging around and the calling of the tickets and chatter in the kitchen.  They have some great ingredients they are working with, so I don't understand the lack of flavors.  The dress is stated as smart casual, but most people were very casual.  Interesting to see David DeCastro in with his family for a meal...wonder what they thought of it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for Valentine's Day 2013.  Surprisingly, the restaurant didn't look too busy.  Our waitress was a bit flighty and too busy chatting/flirting with her co-workers to actually be attentive to our table (I probably would have ordered another glass of wine).  However the food was SUPERB!!  It's a shame that their staff isn't as good as their chefs.    Our appetizer was the FLASH FRIED CALAMARI AND ROCK SHRIMP.  I'm always unsure about ordering seafood when living away from the Coast, but this was fresh and lightly crispy.  I knew the meal would be delicious from the first bite.  I NEVER order beef as an entree, but when I read \"Prime Rib with Orange Glazed Green Beans and Mashed Potatoes, served with Au Jus and Horseradish Sauce\" I had to try it!  Perfectly cooked to Medium Rare, this steak was smoke infused and mouth-wateringly good.  I'm beginning to salivate just thinking about it.  We left completely stuffed and satisfied.  Though it took a while for our waitress to clear the table and bring our check, it was a lovely night.  I will definitely return for the food... hopefully the staff steps it up a bit to match the food being served."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 2. Promptly received confirmation. So far, so good. Arrived just prior to time. Well received by front, though their information indicated there would be 4 of us. No problem, within minutes we were seated upstairs. Server arrived shortly. He was busy but was appropriately attentive, good personality, and suggestions upon request.   One awkward situation. We were seated at a table for two, opposite each other. However, table is long, putting some distance between your date and yourself. Difficult to carry on a private conversation without leaning in very far, both of you, so as to be heard but not by the entire crowd.  Food: Warm bread, cheese and herb selections, always welcome.  Drinks innovative (sangria, jacked apple.....wow!), starters good ((creamed kale was tremendous (I'd eat this with dirt, it was so good!), loved the beet salad)), entrees very tasty. Crab Cannelloni was a very generous serving and hot, oh, and quite delicious! The Confit Cracklin' Pork Shank was also quite enough to eat, delicious, however, only lukewarm. Forged ahead anyway, just a slip-up not expected, and a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Six Penn is a frequent lunch stop for my Pittsburgh coworkers and I, and I've had many creative dishes there. Lots of good soup, salad, and sandwich options for lunch, in addition to some larger entrees. My last dish was shrimp and grits, which was delicious but came out a bit lukewarm. The buffalo mac & cheese is a winner every time, and the calamari po' boy looked amazing and got rave reviews. A solid four stars."}
{"text":"Over the years I have frequented SixPenn during lunch.  Some experiences have been above a 3, some have been low, so it can be hit or miss.  It's an ok go to, but nothing phenomenal or extra special.  I'll run down a few food options:   Buffalo Mac: Everyone seems to rave about the Buffalo Mac n cheese.  It's really just standard Mac with some buffalo sauce mixed in, you could make it at home. But I get where people are coming from if you are having a craving.    Veggie Burger: solid but has a spice.  Comes with a lightly dresses salad so is a healthy option if you hold the bun.  Pizzas: I've tried the pizza specials and they've had some good combos.  Would recommend these if the selection sounds good that day!  Pulled Pork Sandwich: sounds better than it comes.  Pork is tender, but severely over sauced with not the best flavor.  Example of trying to hard and could benefit from a more traditional bbq sauce.  Definitely needed more meet.  Fries on the side were good!  Service: This is where it gets weird.  I've had some outstanding experiences and some horrible ones.  Be prepared and pray for the good wait staff!"}
{"text":"We came here for drinks before a play and the location is def great. Six Penn is HUGE and luckily we were seated right away, but from what I've heard, it gets pretty packed during the evening hours (especially on weekends) and if we come back, we'll keep that in mind. They had some vegetarian options - which I thought was great, but also nothing to write home about. Tater tots? Um, no thanks. I can buy those from the grocery store and microwave them myself for an equally soggy, yet greasy, appetizer. The mac and cheese was good but my Hoegaarden was better (naturally). Nothing to rave about except how conveniently close it was to the theatre."}
{"text":"This place was great! We were seated quickly and the waitstaff were attentive even though the place was pretty full. I got the PEI mussels as my appetizer. It could have easily been shared between two people, it was a huge pile of mussels, and they were cooked spot on. There was bacon and onions and butter along for the ride. It was the best mussels I've had short of eating on coastal vacations I've taken. My main course was duck confit with bucatini. I honestly can't tell you everything that was in this dish, but it was delicious. A wonderful balance between the duck, cherries, bleu cheese, almond slivers, and some greenery, not sure but i think it was endive. I would recommend this place to anyone headed down to the cultural district, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We brunched at Six Penn on Sunday, February 13th.  At 1030 am, we were the second table to arrive and immediately the host informed us that he had, \"a table saved just for you.\"  He took us up the stairs, away from the open, charming portion of the restaurant and seated us in the dingy upstairs (old fraying carpet, smelled of water leakage).  The only other couple in the restaurant was seated downstairs.  Strange.  A nice but very odd young man was our waiter.  It was challenging to query him on the various menu items.  And the menu!  The misuse of quotation marks and apostrophes was deeply perplexing.  In order to calm my nerves, I ordered a bloody mary, extra spicy.  We ordered the coffee frites to share, my companion ordered the keystone breakfast and I, the huevos rancheros.  The bloody mary was vodka and bloody mary mix with extra tabasco.  Uninspiring.  The coffee frites were also disappointing - clearly the fryer was not yet hot, so the potatoes were limp and grease soaked (although the ground coffee and six penn spices were nice).  The keystone breakfast was not particularly impressive, but fine except that my companion (who has never seen a potato he doesn't like) found the red-skinned potato home fries to be \"not that good.\" My own portion of the potatoes was served cold, so I didn't have more than a bite and found them to be mushy and tasteless.  But the real piece de resistance of this meal was the \"huevos rancheros.\"  The over-easy eggs were very very well done, the \"ranchero sauce\" was store bought salsa and the black beans were so undercooked that I couldn't spear one with my fork.  I informed the server of the problem and he was incapable of offering a solution - I suggested that he bring the dish back, with the eggs cooked appropriately and minus the little black stones.  As we were waiting for this issue to be resolved my companion finished his meal and our coffee mugs, water glasses and bloody mary glass sat irrefutably empty.  The manager returned with...the wrong plate (eggs smothered in cheese) quickly understood that all was not well...and after several more minutes appeared with a plate of huevos rancheros, minus the beans (the chef did send along his thanks for informing him of the dish's infirmities.  The server also offered that in order to address the problem, they were going to \"soak\" the beans - is that some My Cousin Vinny, physics defying method for expeditiously solving the problem of undercooked beans??).  They kindly removed the huevos rancheros from the bill.  Total - $27 plus tip.  I wouldn't recommend the place for any meal, certainly not brunch."}
{"text":"Only been to Six Penn Kitchen for large group (20+ people) dinners with colleagues and future colleagues.  Food (7.75/10) = Have tried the following dishes:  Appetizers: 1) Flash Fried Calamari Appetizer ($10) = Nice and crispy, with proper proportion of batter to calamari.  Served with a sweet sauce if desired.  Overall, a great appetizer for sharing.   2) Local Cheese and Charcuterie Plate ($15) = An assortment of cheeses and meats.  The selections have been different on my visits, and a card naming the cheese/meats are included when served.  The housemade jam is a nice sweet addition to the salty and savory meats and cheeses.  However, the meats have just been meh. 3) Scallops ($14) = \"Two seared sea scallops over butternut squash puree, fried leeks, house-made cornbread, topped with a sherry reduction.\"  The scallops are cooked nicely by the folks at Six Penn.  This is my favorite appetizer from the restaurant in terms of flavor, but it's also one of the dishes I feel is way overpriced.  $14 for 2 scallops?  Seriously?  Entrees: 1) Cracklin' Pork Shank ($22) = with \"sauerkraut, bacon mashed potatoes, serrano apple puree.\"  Huge piece of meat! Skin is certainly crispy and flavorful.  Meat is almost fork tender...almost.  However, flavor of the meat itself was just meh.  Not the best pork shank I've had.  This dish isn't bad, but certainly not great.   2) Braised Short Ribs ($23) = \"Braised beef short ribs tossed with julienned vegetables and a whole grain horseradish cream sauce over spinach ravioli and finished with chopped watercress and shaved Parmesan.\"  One of the better entrees on the menu. Savory dish, with great flavors from each component.  3) Lamb Bolognese ($23) =  Pappardelle, roasted tomatoes, feta cheese.  Of the entrees I've tried, I think this is the best Six Penn has to offer.  A rich, savory dish, with generous amounts of lamb meat.    Sides: Mac N' Cheese ($6) = utilized penne pasta.  The mac n' cheese tastes good.  But nothing special.  Pretty much the same as the other mac and cheese served at other Pgh restaurants.  Desserts:  1) Chocolate Truffle Cake ($7) = Chocolate cake with chocolate chips, ganache & fudge, ganache icing served with vanilla bean milk.  A nice rich chocolate cake.  The milk is a nice complement to the chocolate richness. 2) Apple Pie ($6.50) = Granny Smith & Fuji apples with housemade ice cream.  The vanilla ice cream was nice.  The flavor of the apples was just ok though. 3) Cranberry bread pudding = seasonal bread pudding.  Similarly to the apple pie, this dish was meh for me. 4) Lemon and mimosa sorbet = Sorbet is a great refreshing option to conclude a rich/heavy multi-course meal at Six Penn.  The mimosa sorbet flavor was weird though.  ] 5) Banana foster cheesecake ($7) = seasonal.  Rich cheesecake with a good banana flavor profile.   6) SIX PENN \"CIRCUS\" ($8) = An assortment of \"Cracker Jacks\", whoopie pies, cinnamon doughnuts, and cotton candy. A very festive dessert, and a great one to share with the party.  Service (9.0/10) = It seems many of the relatively poor reviews already written of Six Penn is due to poor service.  I can only speak from my experiences, and they have been great.  Perhaps it is because of arrangements made ahead of time for our 20+ group dinners, and the folks at Six Penn had time to prepare?  Maybe.  Regardless, the waiters/waitresses were very professional, attentive with drinks, and food was brought out promptly.    Ambiance (8.0/10) = A three floor restaurant situated across the street from Heinz Hall of performing arts.  Bottom floor with the open kitchen and bar.  Second floor with another bar, and more tables.  And an outdoor rooftop.  Casual, maybe classy, dimly lit areas are features as well.  You can try to find street parking, or park in the garage across the street.  I'm not sure how much the restaurant compensates customers for the garage parking.    Overall opinion = I think Six Penn kitchen is great for large groups, based on my experiences.  Service has always been great for me.  The food overall ranges from just ok to good.  Nothing spectacular. Also, like other restaurants in Pittsburgh, I feel the food is slightly overpriced for the quality.  The quantity is fine.  If you're looking to hold large group dinners or functions, I'd recommend Six Penn Kitchen."}
{"text":"This review will be rather short compared to my others as I have not eaten at Six Penn. In fact, I've only visited once. Once was enough.  My one and only visit was on a Sunday after a super delicious brunch at Meat & Potatoes (dear Meat & Potatoes: I love you. You put almost all other restaurants to shame). I was looking for a different spot for drinks and decided I wanted to check out Six Penn, despite my boyfriend's aversion to the place. I insisted on rooftop seating because damn it, I love rooftop seating. It was hot, but being from Florida I'm used to it. Plus, we got to sit under a neat cabana and there was a great breeze, which kept us fairly comfortable.   Here's where it all went downhill: our server comes by we ordered our drinks. I went with a mojito. I effing love mojitos, one of my favorite summer drinks. I enjoyed them quite a bit in Florida, which makes sense. I was excited to have one here. On a rooftop! I haven't enjoyed this scene in months! I'm all pumped to get my drink ... here comes the server ... I'm taking a sip ... Aah, wtf is this?? They did not just make my mojito with lime sours ... another sip ... yeah, they did.  -_-  P.S. They got two stars for the cool rooftop seating. And because maybe I'll come back and try the food, avoid the mojito."}
{"text":"Lovely place.  Get the pretzel appetizer, it is freshly made there, it's the best pretzel I've ever had anywhere."}
{"text":"I came here with a group from my university for dinner. We were seated in a private room on the second floor and were served family-style, so my experience will likely be a bit different from most of the other patrons.  For appetizer we were serve d a simple house salad (i.e. lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers). For the main course we were served rotisserie chicken with grilled potatoes, asparagus, and penne pasta in a creamy white sauce with broccoli. (It was likely Alfredo sauce, but I am not completely sure). The main course was very good. No food remained on anyone's plate so that likely signals that the other students were satisfied too. For desert we were served small pastries which I did not try, but the other students did not have a hard time finishing them up either.  The service for our party was very quite attentive (especially for a party of college students).  As I walked through the restaurant, I had the opportunity to see what some of the other patrons ordered, and all the dishes looked appealing. I would definitely return on my own."}
{"text":"Wow, the confit cracklin' pork shank was amazing. A tender, slow cooked pork shank that seems like it has been finished in the fryer. The outside is crispy, the inside juicy and rich. Served over some of the tastiest mashed potatoes I've had, the potatoes were spiked with bacon, dijon and sauerkraut. A serrano-apple sauce was served on the side as well as some fresh sautéed apples. A well thought out dish with complimenting flavors and textures.   My girlfriend had the duck breast which was seared perfectly, medium-rare as requested. It was juicy and flavorful, served with sweet potatoes ricotta gnocchi, and roasted fall root vegetables with a dijon sauce that was not overpowering. The gnocchi were chewy, light and browned slightly. We could have eaten a plate of them alone!  Looking forward to more meals here when I am back in the area again."}
{"text":"We went to the Six Penn Kitchen on Sunday for a birthday brunch. Making a reservation was wise - this place is busy! The staff is exceedingly friendly and welcoming as well.  Food arrived quickly - greatly appreciated since we had a full day of activities.   What we ate: I ordered a Bloody Mary - nothing quite compares to a well made bloody mary and I have sampled a whole range. Unfortunately, here, the mix they make up is so heavily spiced that it is undrinkable. I like some heat with my bloody mary but I also like to actually taste more than Tabasco - the complexity of the flavors was completely lost. On a scale of 1-10 for heat this easily landed at an 8. I would not be surprised if the person making the mix had twice seasoned it but wonder why they did not bother to taste it to make sure it was mixed correctly.   Typically the drink should be made medium hot - this burned my throat and destroyed my pallet for the meal. I asked for the bar to remake the drink but was told that it was a premade mix and was offered some plain tomato juice to temper it. Didn't really improve the drink. Super disappointed and I left essentially a full $10 drink on the table. Note to self: never order a Bloody Mary here again.   For the meal my husband and daughter wisely ordered the waffles. They were crisp and tasted great. The buttermilk gelato was a nice, fresh contrast with a really light flavor. They really nailed that dish. Next time I will be ordering that.   He also ordered a side of bacon - that was an error. It came out late, really greasy and looked as thought it had been on the flattop too long - really overcooked, broken into several pieces. I would have expected a better quality, thick sliced bacon than the thin, over done version we were served. He actually didn't finish it and for him - that says it all. I have never seen him pass up bacon.   I ordered the shrimp and grits. Yikes, what a mistake. They clearly don't understand how to cook grits... they need to be creamy and smooth. Cooked slowly. Here the grits were very thick and clumpy. The consistency of mashed potatoes. Further, not sure if the person seasoning the shrimp also made the bloody mary mix, but again, too much heat. In defense of the kitchen it was noted as creole seasoning and part of the issue really may have been the terrible drink I was served. the grits, however, were unforgivable.   In the end it was a mixed bag. The service was outstanding. The manager popped by to check on us. The server, Tim, was efficient and friendly. Everyone made you feel welcomed and even with how busy the place was you never felt rushed or that the staff was in the weeds.   The drink really ruined the entire meal for me and the grits were terrible. That said, I would likely head back and get the waffles - or maybe the French toast..."}
{"text":"Came here today (Easter Sunday) for brunch with my family, and the food was delicious! Service was great as well. We didn't have a reservation, but got there when they opened at 10:30am. We were seated immediately. We were out by 11:45am! I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which I would go back next Sunday for. The breakfast potatoes/hash browns are some of the best I've ever had. The bread basket of cherry scones, banana bread, and blueberry & raspberry muffins was delicious as well! My mom even got some cherry scones to go :). The peach Bellini is amazing as well. We had absolutely no complaints. Can't wait to come back for another brunch!"}
{"text":"I made reservations here for 6 before went to a play at the Benedum, but ran into traffic on the way down so sadly was late for my reservation.  I called on the way to let them know and they were very nice and said that would be fine and our table would still be there when we arrive.   When got there it was very busy so it was pretty loud but not loud enough that you couldn't hear the people you were with at your table.  Our waiter, Mark, was very friendly and even gave me great advice for parking the next time came down for a play!   I ordered the buffalo pasta dish and my mother got the salmon special.  Mine was quite yummy.  The blue cheese on top really gave the dish an extra kick.  I tried my mothers salmon it was good but not the best I've ever had, but she enjoyed it enough.   The drinks we got were not my favorite, I got the strawberry basil mojito and there was just to many chunks of strawberries in it, very sweet.  Overall our experience here was pleasant."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal!  I was just here for the first time for dinner last night, and I am already wishing myself to be back!  I ordered the duck, medium rare, and I was the best piece of game I have ever eaten!  Not to mention, the sides were delicious as well.  The chef even catered to my request to substitute asparagus for the beans.  I also had the pleasure of sampling my friends dishes as well.  The pork shank was huge and rather scrumptious.  My other friend also got the Sea Stew, and I promise the price is well worth the plate.  The risotto that the sea creatures sit upon soaks up all the sea broth, and by the end of the bowl, you find yourself enjoying the delicious risotto.  Like I said, I cannot wait to come back here.  The food was amazing and the atmosphere was something that I have not seen in many restaurants in the Pittsburgh area.  Next time, I want to eat on the roof!"}
{"text":"This last visit to Pittsburgh  was the 5th time I've been here, and booked a private area for a group of 16 colleagues. The staff were friendly, responsive, flexible and accommodating during the menu-planning arrangements.  We had the room to ourselves on a cool rainy Tuesday, and were really able to enjoy the time and interactions.   We had the most positive feedback on the Cracklin' Pork Shank, but the Strip Steak also had some fans. Everyone enjoyed the appetizers - flatbread pizza with tomatoes, wings with an Asian twist, and calamari and shrimp.   The evening closed with a sugar overload with the \"Six Penn Circus\" for the table.  We highly recommend you try this place if you're in town!!"}
{"text":"Recommend by my sister this place can be a hit or miss. The first time we went It was a definite miss. Didn't enjoy my dessert which was a apple turnover. It was dry and lacked sweetness. The last time we went however was much better.  My husband ordered a caesar salad and I ordered the calamari. His salad was pretty good and they added extra anchovies which were for me. My calamari was lightly battered and still crispy. the sweet thai chili sauce that came with it was very good.  For dessert which shared their carnival treat which came with cracker jack popcorn, cotton candy, and donuts. it was a pretty big dessert, definitely enough for two.  I would recommend this place for their drinks. My virgin Mojito or Nojito as they called it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"We went to the Sunday Brunch and the atmosphere and service were great. The Mimosas are way over priced at $9 each. We had the grits, the Monte Cristo sandwich and The sweet yam quiche. Overall the food was great, but be prepared for gourmet style food with different flavor twists. Nothing simple or normal food wise here. We enjoyed our experience, but can also understand some of the other people's revues."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here while visiting my sister-in-law. It had a \"chill\" vibe to it and a nice, diverse crowd. Our server was friendly and prompt. He recommended we get the buffalo mac and cheese, as it is a popular menu item. I got the gourmet burger (med-well) and fries to add some variety to our order; both of which tasted great. My husband got the buffalo mac and cheese and almost licked the plate clean. Their food was great, they had a friendly staff, nice vibe, and seemed pretty popular considering how busy it was! I would visit again next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"BRAVO! BRAVA! ENCORE! ENCORE!  We visited around 11:30 today for brunch, and what a brunch it was! Everything we ordered was delicious and well-prepared. Our servers were attentive, kind, and genuinely personable. Great atmosphere. The only thing that could use a touch of improvement is the plating/presentation of food; I personally don't care about that much, though I know some people might.  My boyfriend and I got beignets to start... They tasted amazing. A small doughnut of sorts, they were not greasy at all, so soft on the inside and the raspberry sauce, chocolate shavings and vanilla cream they were served on complimented them well. We got a mimosa and a peach bellini to drink; both were sweet, crisp, brunch-time refreshment. They gave us a few small scones and a pumpkin bread to try--all were great.  My meal was definitely the star of this whole meal. I ordered the chicken-fried steak. It came served on warm doughy biscuits, and topped with a mountain of perfectly cooked scrambled eggs and sausage gravy. It was fantastic! My boyfriend got eggs benedict, which were also great and had delicious collard greens on them. Certainly glad I went there on an empty stomach! In my opinion the food was well worth the price.   Not quite sure why this place only has 3 stars to its name! Maybe we just got lucky, but next time I come to Pittsburgh, I'll be sure to make a return visit!"}
{"text":"Took a woman on a lunch date here and everything was fantastic. Our Server Nik was attentive but not overbearing and was sure to point out what was available and what was not. Food was delicious and the portions were perfect. Definitely recommend to anybody stopping by for a quick scrumptious lunch."}
{"text":"Dropped in last night for a celebratory dinner with my fiancé. We ordered the weatherbury farm polenta and Gorgonzola gnocchi paired with a martini and a glass of red wine. First of all, for a whopping $55 for morsels of food the server was entitled, rude, and made it clear he seemed irritated that he had to take care of us. He didn't come back to check on us and the food was delivered cold. I will never go back after that experience."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar (business trip). Food was good. Service was slow and \"distant\" - not personal.  The Ahi Tina was tasty, the spinach salad delicious.  Had to interrupt the bartender to get served. With 2 others at the bar. Not impressed for their price point."}
{"text":"Good service from the second we walked in until the very end (when the Chef came out and spoke with us for a little bit).  Unique specials and very well informed staff.  Will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is average. Nice craft beer selection.  I just love the rooftop! Everyone should dine on the roof at least once in their lifetime. Come early and rush to the top. It's first come, first serve, and honestly the only reason I return here. Perfect to grab a drink and enjoy the city before an event.  Customer service is lacking, right down to the website. I requested information on booking a rooftop party and haven't heard back at all (three weeks later). Moving on to option B and no longer considering Six Penn Kitchen, at all. Bummer."}
{"text":"my bourbon orange julep was pretty tasty.  Cornbread was a little overcooked and tasted a bit weird.  Rock shrimp and calamari app was good.  The lo mein salad was tasty but spicy, didnt care so much for the accompanying spring roll.  My fish was ok, the accompanying basmati rice with some kind of vanilla sauce was good.  The side dishes of parmesan asparagus and the mac n cheese were ok as well.  Nothing stood out as spectacular.  They undercooked my co0workers' steaks, but fixed that promptly."}
{"text":"First off, let me say this.  I knew that this restaurant was owned by the same hospitality group that owns Eat-N-Park, but who knew that it would be such a departure?  I come here mostly for lunch with my co-workers.  To be completely honest, I love this restaurant but I wouldn't make a special trip \"dahntahn\" for dinner because of the limited menu.  (My family and friends are generally picky eaters) However, what they prepare, they prepare well and I enjoy the food as well as the decor.  Love, love, love their French Onion soup and Sweet Tea Smoked Wings!  I have had just those two items as a meal. (Melted cheese, bread and fat.  Not the most nutritious, but you only live once!)  I'm a wing and French Onion soup freak!  You can't go wrong with the flat iron steak (Griglia) or the Crab & Zucchini cake.  If you're in the mood for a sammich, that Cracklin Shank Cuban or SPK Cheesesteak will make you hurt somebody trying to get to either one!  Like I said, not a lot of choices like the traditional Eat-N-Park menu, but the food quality and ambience of the restaurant far exceeds the parent restaurant's usual fare."}
{"text":"Solid staff. Very attentive. Overall good experience. I work for a local hotel and I'm very confidentiality in sending them my regulars who wish to venture out into the city. keep it up..."}
{"text":"We hit Six Penn before a show for dinner, and afterwards for dessert.  The food was quite good both times.    We let our dinner server know that we had a show to attend, and she timed the courses perfectly.   She was very familiar with the menu, and very attentive.  Overall, we were very impressed by this place, and plan on going back sometime."}
{"text":"I've tried having dinner and brunch, not at all impressed. Overpriced, flavorless food, and long waits for no reason. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, defiantly not getting me a third time."}
{"text":"Six Penn is a great before theatre venue.  Call ahead for reservations.  But table top at the bar is fine as it is also full menu.  A HUGE list of wines available.  Food decent.  Casual dress.  WiFi available.  Bartender/hostess was excellent.  They do \"local food\" when possible.  Simple hamburger was well seasoned.  Convenient to Heinz, Byram, and Benedum.  Parking galore."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is 5 star, price could be better. That's the reason for the 4 star rating.  Happy hour drink prices are good, but the roof menu is overpriced. We ordered $6 Parmesean fritters. We thought we were getting cheese sticks, but actually got crackers. A little dissappointed but not enough to keep me from coming back"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and fall in love with each time for a different reason. The secret ingredients in their dishes is love as I haven't tried something I didn't like. With that said it's a no brainer that the service is outstanding. My fav is the never ending wine list though. They also have a Tuna dish that could be my entire entree and a zucchini bread that I could eat by the loaf. It's so sad to hear this place is closing as it was one of my favs. Between the staff, the food, and atmosphere I wasn't sure what I liked best. I would definitely recommend checking it out before they close their doors in February because their food isn't just food it's an experience."}
{"text":"Nor bad food, actually pretty good. But not cheap for what it is, which is upper crust bar or casual dinner type."}
{"text":"The location is perfect if you're going to the theater or Heinz Hall.  We went right before an orchestra concert and it's very convenient.  There are two floors. The downstairs looks interesting. Unfortunately, we were wisked upstairs which has all the atmosphere of a train station -- and the noise level too. Service was so-so. Yes, it was busy, but come on, the restaurant has been open for ages and clearly gets a lot of pre-theater and pre-concert traffic. You have to figure out how to handle the rush. Other restaurants downtown do much, MUCH better.  Food. I had the trout dish, which claimed to have \"almond dusted\" but I couldn't really see or taste any. There as also a fried egg, which was tasty but frankly didn't fit with the trout. It was fine, but nothing special.  My date had the beet and goat cheese salad which was good. Tasty, colorful and a  nice dish.  The dessert.. well, we ordered the apple pie with caramel ice cream. It was extremely slow, and when it came out, the apples were completely cold. The waitress was apologetic and took it off the bill. (We decided to take it home and it was tasty the next day.)  Atmosphere.. the tables were very close and you felt like you were having dinner with the neighboring tables. I was closer to the other tables than my date.  Would I go back? No, sorry. Even taking the location into account, there are better restaurants downtown for pre-theater or pre-concert meals."}
{"text":"Ate here during restaurant week, at first the service was awful. Didn't get our drinks or order food for the first 20 minutes but we found out that they were swamped with customers trying to rush out to get to the theater next door. Once the restaurant calmed down, the service was great and the food came out quickly. I got the salmon which was amazing. It was well worth the wait but I would recommend to not go before 7 at all because they will be packed and very busy"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Waitress was top notch.  Able to answer questions.   Folded our napkins when someone went to see some friends or the bathroom.   Another helped with the great wine list.  Hard to get service like this.  The place was full, so surprised how excellent the service was.   The caesar salad was one of the best I have had with fresh parmesan, anchovies fresh romaine.  The crab cakes were cooked perfectly and very tasty with a pistachio and apricot crumb."}
{"text":"Was in the district for a show. Admittedly we were sensitive about service time as we had a curtain time. We picked the wrong night to have a time sensitivity issue. Place was fairly dead (Thursday night) and our service was slow. (when a check pay is a 5 minute plus turn...it's a negative whether I got somewhere to be or not) No real points off there as one in our party has a diet with very narrow specifications. The food was inviting in print with a sharp, concise and curated menu. They know their wheelhouse, which is a plus. We ordered pretzel bites for something fun with no mention that bread was already en route. So we unwittingly doubled down on the carbs out of the gate. lol. Bites were a weird sweet dough ball that the accompanying sauces and mustard (which was decent) just rolled off of. Bread was nothing special. I got the beef bourguignon. Meat was well tender but the sauce was way way too heavy. I get that it's wine reduction and meant to be comfort but it was dense with a cough syrup level flavor intensity! And slathered so steep on everything that it became too obnoxious and I literally could not finish it the carrots and potatoes. My wife got the Bison burger. The bun wasn't worth the EXTRA carbs. She felt it was goodish, but nothing too much beyond something from Red Robin. Someone near us had a mountain of pink cotton candy sat in front of them. I thought it was a joke. Turns out no it's literally on the menu. For a fairly buttoned down feeling place it just seemed odd and stuck out as the only real fun to be had in the place. Couldn't imagine a kitchen making room for a cotton candy machine for a few orders a night. But each to their own. Given the surrounding options we wouldn't return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner before a show at the Benedum. Our server was very attentive and made sure we made it to our show on time. Cowboy burger was very good and the mac n cheese was tasty. The fish tacos were good, but not the best. Very nice atmosphere and perfect location in the cultural district. The homemade after dinner mints are awesome!"}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese is really good. Not sure why this place is getting average ratings. Everything we ordered was good."}
{"text":"I was torn between two and three stars. The food was decent, but not great. Some other dishes I saw looked pretty good as well. The service was mediocre at best.  We had the calamari and rock shrimp appatizer. It wasok. They put too much sauce all over everything for me. Then I had a petite filet...and they weren't kidding about petite!! Once again they drowned it sauce and was just ok.   If I was back in Pitt I would try this place again, but I would go in already thinking it was going to be just ok."}
{"text":"We waited for tables to be bussed so we could be seated. Once seated, we waited for our waitress to appear. Once she took our drink/brunch orders, we waited to actually get our drinks and food. Bottom line: Lots of waiting...  I'll say that the pre-meal muffin/scone/pastry basket was pretty tasty; and, my non-traditional eggs benedict was different/yummy (Carolina BBQ pulled pork, poached egg, English Muffin, scallion salad; creole hollandaise). I also liked the option to build your own kid's plate. On a down note, I noticed dirty floors, dirty walls, and a pretty messy bathroom. The value of the meal, however, was great at $47 for two adults and a child  Because our visited coincided with the marathon, and because we only had brunch options, I hope to go back and potentially try dinner, as well as outdoor seating."}
{"text":"When we were there the service was very good!  Friendly waitress, I did love the Mac n'Cheese.  I definitely want to go back,  I'd love to see the Roof Top deck, Rachel mentioned!  I also had the Ceasar Salad, very good!"}
{"text":"We went in for an early dinner on a cold and gloomy Saturday. We had reservations and were seated right away, the restaurant wasn't very busy. We were led to a long narrow table right next to a huge group. We rebelled and asked for a booth. The host staff pondered a bit and said well, we can give you a booth, but we will be needing it by 6:45. Yeah, right. We will hurry thru dinner to give your table back. Ha ha. Sure, I said. We took the booth.   Service was very attentive and warm and friendly. We both had salads. For dinner, B.J. selected the Lobster Mac N Cheese. We were both expecting very little evidence of lobster, but there was actually a good quantity. The pasta and the cheese sauce was very delicious. I love this dish! I opted for the Surf & Turf. They have since changed the menu, but my steak was a perfectly grilled filet mignon with a super yummy crab cake.   For dessert, we had the winter trio. It was a small portion of ginger cake and a huge creme brulee. Loved, loved, loved dessert. I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  I was so excited because this is one of my favorite places to eat.  We arrived and were seated in the private room with 4 other parties.  It was so loud we could not be enjoy our meal.  When we asked to be moved to the dinning room they did not respond.  The night got worse and our food finally came out after 1 1/2.  After all is said and done they comped our 200 meal!  Crazy made it right!"}
{"text":"Monday is the FREE CORKAGE Night... so hit that up.  Great atmosphere, service and food overall... had the fish of the day and the flank steak, where both my girlfriend and I were NOT disappointed.  We were then presented with the menu for dessert and both were conflicted, as it was not that we could not find something we liked but was full that night. We both agreed ALL of the items from the in-house made sorbet and ice  cream to the chocolate cake, looked and sounded good but just could not muster up the courage to stuff our faces even more than they pleasantly were that night.  Suggest to go on a Monday night and go early... ENJOY!"}
{"text":"A salad.  It consisted of two leaves of Romaine lettuce, with a few beans, a few chunks of ham fat, and other assorted small things scattered about.  In a pool of about a teaspoon of pesto.  Very pretty dish.  Not much to eat though.  And pretty tasteless.  The main was so unimpressive I can't even remember what it was a week later.  But I do remember it was expensive.  I could have had a good steak for that price."}
{"text":"We originally wanted meat and potatoes and couldn't get in so we came here. We got sat in front of the cooks cooking and honestly it was a great show and we didn't even mind the wait. This was some of the best food we have ever had and can't wait to come back. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent place downtown.   Aside from the great location, service was very friendly.     My friends and I had reservations on a Saturday night and had a nice time.  We started with salads and my Caesar was fine.   For entrees, we had a variety of things...short ribs, gnocchi and spaghetti.  I had the wild boar spaghetti and it was fine, a little greasy or oily but it tasted all right.  My friend who had the gnocchi was not a fan and in addition to the small portion size they just didn't look that great.  The short ribs were good.  For dessert we had a lemon tart which was nice and the \"circus\" dessert which was cotton candy, cracker jack, mini donuts and whoopee pies.  It was pretty good.  I thought everything here was fine but nothing was necessarily outstanding.  I think if you eat here, you'll have a good experience so I am giving this a solid three star rating."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, nice patio seating, menu looks awesome... food didn't live up to the hype. They need to rethink their gnocci, a guy needs more than 7 at a $22 price point... and why would you deep fry them?!? Completely underwhelmed. I'd give them a second shot next time I'm in town, maybe I just caught the kitchen on an off night. :/"}
{"text":"I was in a hurry to see a show at the Byham, so I only ordered an entree and a cocktail. The service was great. My risotto was delicious -- and quick. I had the PB&J \"dessert cocktail\" and it was DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"One of my places in the Cultural District to stop for a drink or meal with friends. A kid at heart, the cotton candy is to die for! Even if you are having a glass of wine, get a side of cotton candy!"}
{"text":"For the last 4 years or so we have stopped in at Six Penn Kitchen during our twice annual visits to Pittsburgh. They have a happy hour, have a great rooftop deck and are situated close to PNC Park. There are three levels and a bar on each level. For beer drinkers you better figure out what you want because the tap selections are different on every level. Depending on who serves you, you may have a server who will get you what you want wherever you are seated...or if you had one of our recent servers up on the top level - forget it.  If you want it get it yourself but then they give you the attitude because they lost out on the tip!  We stopped in on our way to a Pirates game in early September and because of the heat, chose the empty first floor bar, staffed by a dark haired bartender who was slow to wait on us and reluctant to tell us about the drink specials.  Didn't offer a menu, obviously not delighted to be there that afternoon! Beer options are Ok, if you prefer wine the actual options are not so great.  Plus your whole experience may be influenced by your server's attitude. In my case I was so disgusted that I just had a glass of water since my companion had ordered a beer already.  If you want a great rooftop bar, this is a place to go. If you want a friendly staff you can go just about anywhere else to find great menus, nice wine and beer selections!"}
{"text":"HOLD UP, WAIT A MINUTE....I promise I won't start rapping, but seriously peeps, I haven't reviewed this place?!  I feel like I'm doing myself and you all a disservice!  It makes me very sad that this is only a 3 star place at the moment because I really truly love it!  Maybe it's the connection with my favorite Smiley Guy (Mr. Eat n' Park himself) or maybe it's the FABUlous brunch on Sundays, but I love it!  Of course, you can't come to this place without ordering the Buffalo Chicken (or Lobster) Mac n' Cheese (unless you're there for brunch....ok...do it for brunch too!).  It's a plate of oohey gooey goodness touched by God himself I think!  I've had a couple other items worth mentioning, like the noodle salad and lamb chops.  But the Mac n' Cheese....blows it all away.  Let's move on to my fav topic...BRUNCH!!  Probably at the top of my brunch list in the city.  Sometimes I purposely have to make myself stay away.  Why you ask?  Because I always want to head right in and order the Cheesecake Stuffed French Toast!  It's always topped with a seasonal fruit or sauce (like apples or gingerbread).  I've also had the Eggs Beni, which are fab in their own right, with fresh asparagus to top it off!    They have a really fantastic rooftop deck that I just visited for the first time.  My first thought is to think....how many people can fit up here...because it would be a great place for a party or event.  But it was a bit tinier than I thought it would be.  Great place to be downtown on a warm summer night though!    But the best part of this place...they always have, out of this world, freshly baked bread!  I've had a different bread for dinner and different scones and breads for brunch and they have NEVER disappointed.  This is thee best touch by far!  If they ever forget to bring it to you, REMIND THEM!!  Believe me, I have, no shame in that game!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Six Penn Kitchen randomly for lunch one day. The pizza was AMAZING, the asparagus was perfectly cooked and prepared. The service was awesome and it was definitely somewhere I would like to go again and have recommended to people. I wasn't sure what to expect, and though we did not get huge entrees- our food was perfect for lunch. I was very impressed."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Six Penn for dinner and enjoyed it very much.  I wanted to get dinner reservations for after a show at Heinz Hall today, but they were booked when I tried a week ago.  So, I decided to have lunch/brunch here instead.  Know that even with reservations you may end up sitting I the second level, where you have \"full service,\" but it means the bartender will run about for you and everyone else in the area.  12:45 on a Sunday is post brunch and you have a small amount of menu options.  My lemon creme waffles were cold and one was slightly burnt.  You will still be hungry afterwards.  You self seat and need to wait to have the table cleaned as well.  I am amending this the day after my review because I got an email that I was a no show for my reservation.  I did in fact tell the desk I had a reservation and my name.  Food disappointing, service disappointing."}
{"text":"Six Penn is a great place for dinner or lunch in Pittsburgh.  It is fairly casual but has very good food and very good service.  It has a good range of food choices and a good bar.  It is great for a business lunch, an office party for a small group of 25 or fewer, or for dinner with someone special.  It is also conveniently located in the downtown area near the Gateway T stop.  It doesn't have outdoor seating but the windows on the Penn Avenue side can be opened so for the booths on that side it seems like outdoor dining without sitting on the sidewalk. I recommend Six Penn and have always enjoyed my meals there."}
{"text":"I have been here several times before, but last night was the first time I was on the rooftop deck.  The deck is probably the best thing about this place it's only too bad I discovered it at the end of summer.  The food overall is a little above average.  I'd consider it like an Atrias with a little more flair in the menu and definitely nice that it's not a national chain.  This placed is owned by the fine folks at Eat n Park.  I sampled a few drinks in the downstairs bar having had a sip of a very good dry martini and enjoying a full serving of an average kettle one rocks dirty.  The wine selection was relatively week and even though the prices were good for the wine I would have paid more for a better selection.  The sangria was a little too sweet and I'd say from an alcohol standpointonly a minor step up from kool aid.  We tried the pizza which was really good.  It had great buffalo mozzarella, some fresh basil, and a very thin crispy crust.  The upstairs deck had a decent amount of seating with a few cabanas which provided for some privacy.  Unfortunately, they only had a limited bar with a couple of wine and spirits options and NO MARTINIS??  The staff was very pleasant and I didn't wait for a drink all night and the food was delivered promptly, which is saying a lot because there was 10 of us.  The onion rings were pretty good, they were the straw type onion rings, not the big thick kind that I like and were served with a spicy ketchup.  The lobster mac was delicious with plenty big pieces of lobster not tiny indistinguishable chunks.  This was a very heavy dish and came in a big first course portion.  The wings had great seasoning, some type of caribbean style I'd guess.  However, they were very small with little meat on them.  We also tried a scallop appetizer that was cooked perfectly and big and plump, however the seasoning overpowered the delicate flaver of the sea scallops.  Overall this is a perfectly acceptable not quite fine, but reasonabbly priced finer dining establishment conveniently located with a great deck.  I'll be back.  This place probably deserves 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"The beet salad is very good. The vegetarian pasta was a complete miss. My crab cakes were very small, had little crab, and little taste. Adding salt and pepper helped. The cheese cake was too chilled.  From now on, l.m sticking with the appetizers, which are wonderful. Just to add to my dismay, the  male host drenched a winter coat in olive oil. Never will forget this anniversary...."}
{"text":"It's okay. The macaroni cheese was done well and the service was above average. I thought the cesar salad could have been better."}
{"text":"I really want to give Six Penn 4 stars, but I really cannot bring myself to do so because it really is attempting to be an upscale restaurant with moderately good food, but nothing that I've ever had here makes me think, \"Oh my god, I can't wait to come back and try that again!\", plus the service has gone downhill since they first opened.  I can't say that I've had a bad meal here but I've just never had a great meal here.  On my most recent visit I brought a friend here for brunch before we went to see Boeing, Boeing at the CLO Cabaret.  I made reservations online through Open Table and was a little worried when I received a voicemail from Six Penn on Thursday asking me to call them back about my reservations (I originally wanted to take my friend to Meat & Potatoes for brunch because neither of us have been there before but they were booked) soooo I called back and spoke to the hostess who said that she was simply calling me to have me call THEM back to confirm my reservation for Sunday brunch.  REALLY?!?  I mean, ok, I guess maybe sometimes people bail on their reservations but that was just odd.    So, then comes Sunday and we show up promptly at noon only to have to wait for someone to show up to the front desk to check us in.  Not a big deal, but then the hostess seemed perplexed when I told her that I had made a reservation for 2...anyhow, so way upstairs we go and are seated in a nice side room near the windows.  So far it's not so bad but then comes our server...I don't remember her name, but she must have been having an awful day because she was NOT friendly...not at all.  In fact she seemed really annoyed that we dared to order coffee *GASP* after NOON!!!  She seem really put out that she had to make coffee, then I asked her ahead of time to please bring out more \"Sugar in the Raw\" because there were only 2 packets in the container at our table and you would have thought that I was speaking a foreign language because it took me asking her 3 times worded 3 different ways before she got the gist of what I wanted and she again seemed put out.  My friend told me that I stated my request clearly and politely all 3 times, so who knows. We ordered the beignets to start and they were warm and sweet and were probably my favorite part of the meal, even though I prefer savory to sweet things.  I ordered the shrimp and grits and my friend ordered the chicken fried steak.  Both were tasty, but I tried a bit of her chicken fried steak and we both agreed that it tasted dry - thank goodness it had gravy on it to help moisten it a bit.  The shrimp and grits were a little bland but salty - I'm not sure how that happens, but that's how it hit my palate.  It took forever to get a refill on my coffee even though our server refilled the coffee of the table next to us (which arrived after we did and see, they wanted coffee after noon as well) and when she finally did refill my coffee we were ready for our check which again took an inordinately long time to get.  Maybe she was having a bad morning, I really don't know but the service on this day makes me less inclined to make a trip back here again especially when there are a lot of other choices downtown and in the nearby Strip District for brunch."}
{"text":"I've been to Six Penn many times. My latest visit was when I last went to the opera with MOB (mother of boy) and we dined at Six Penn before the show.   We were seated promptly, but then a waiter didn't appear for at least fifteen minutes. The restaurant (Around 6:30) was packed and incredibly noisy. I couldn't hear a word MOB said during the entire meal. The upstairs dining area is much better regarding noise.   After we were served our aperitifs, we waited another fifteen minutes for the waiter to take our food orders. Thank goodness I made an early dinner reservation! MOB had the pizza and I had the lamb bolognese. Both were tasty, although the bolognese could have used a bit more flavor. Servings are very generous.   Go to Six Penn on a nice weekday evening or a weekend afternoon. That way you can hear the people you are dining with! The rooftop area is a fun place to have a few drinks as well. I just wish the food menu had a bit more to offer."}
{"text":"My fiancé dined here a few days back. When we entered we were expecting to be told we needed reservations or kitchen is closing down, etc. BUT the hostess was really nice & said right this way immediately.  Great first impression for my picky fiancé. We were seated & our server came over quickly & got us waters & my fiancé ordered his usual ice tea but sweetened ice tea. The server did let him know that they didn't have any sweetened tea but instead brought & made sure Michael had LOTS of sugar so he could self sweeten his tea to his own liking.  We ordered the calamari & shrimp - WOW - just so good that I could just eat it all day - everyday - perfection. I also ordered some french onion soup - I'm VERY picky on my french onion soup... it was very good BUT I really love it when it's oozing provolone cheese & all melted... sadly this wasn't quite the case but still excellent.. I just really love the cheese part... this was the biggest bummer. The server was excellent with his service, he didn't rush us nor was he overbearing & pestering. He was a perfect balance of helpful & attentive.  Our food came!! YAY!!! Michael ordered the lamb burger & when he took that first bite I could've swore he was going to pass out of HOW GOOD it was. He basically squealed with glee over it.... did I mention that Michael doesn't typically squeal with glee over anything.... let alone a burger???!!! I got the crab cake - it was fabulous.  We did end up leaving earlier than anticipated because I was feeling a little under the weather - I was in the sun all day so I think I got a little too much of  good thing. All in all, we really enjoyed our time here & will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"The ambiance was very nice. The owner was kind, but I think should be dressed a little more appropriate.. I think he was the owner. The server seemed a little snooty. I'm the type that likes to dine, but I never care about what I wear. I just so happen to get off work that day from painting.... but more then able to pay for my dinner. The food was not good. Very bland. The pizza taste like air freshener, and I had some kind of duck, an it was raw.... the appetizers were a nice portion, but could use a little more sauce.  I doubt I come back... maybe for a beer, but not for the food."}
{"text":"This place is odd... sometimes the meal is great -like beautiful presentation and excellent product. So you start thinking, 'man, I really like this place.' Then you go another time and you think, 'wow, that really stunk. Nevermind.' One such occasion was brunch two weekends ago. The special that day was chicken and waffles, and who am I to refuse such a treat? Well, maybe I should have... I got two drumsticks (who does that????? just two drumsticks, really? Not a breast or even a thigh?) and a very mediocre waffle. While the waffle boasted jalapeño and cheddar, it tasted like any continental breakfast make-it-yourself deal. My little brother made more impressive homemade waffles at 10 years old. And if the two drumsticks weren't bad enough, the chicken was not even mediocre - just lousy. I was feeling totally jipped until I looked at the orders around me... The smoked salmon benedict was definitely made with canned salmon. Whhhhhhaaaaaat!? Who does that?? This place is supposed to be \"fancy.\" I mean, if that were served ironically at a trailer park themed restaurant in Vegas, and it also happened to taste amazing (think: Top Chef canned meat challenge), then sure! But this was... let's just say I'm not sure how they could serve it and not be embarrassed. Finally, the breakfast burger, while sounding awesome on the menu, was completely boring to the palate. Also, they said it was served on a pretzel bun (which, yay!) and it definitely came on boring old brioche - without an explanation (like we wouldn't notice the blatant not pretzel bread). However, I must note that the service was just as kind as it always has been.  Overall - It was just bad. I would definitely not go here for brunch ever again. I'm not sure who is running this kitchen, but my advice is COHESION. If one meal is awesome but the next is awful, you will not retain your clientele. Get it together, kitchen folks. You have a great location, lovely front of house staff, a nice drink menu, and lots of potential, BUT you are squandering it!"}
{"text":"Again, yay for ambience. It actually looks really rather nice, and one I might try to dress up better for if I ever went back... except there were quite a few people in shorts in this heat.  The service was so-so. They only come back for set service times: (1) seat you, (2) get your drink order, (3) drop your drink order, (4) get your food order, (5) drop your food order, (6) give your check, (7) take your payment, (8) give back your stuff for signing. Some of these are combined. They don't come for anything else, and won't look at you if it's not one of the eight times mentioned. If you don't have many needs, this would be fine. If you do, it seems you may be SOL. (I feel sorry for the people sitting on the table next to ours.) It would really help if servers could have just a bit of peripheral version when serving other tables (especially when their tables are grouped pretty close to each other - there's a reason for that, you know). It would also help if they didn't just stare at the kitchen when waiting for food and looked out. Perhaps I'm criticizing too much.  The food sounded a little experimental.. at least, when we were there. The hubby had coffee-grilled steak and eggs ($14). The grounds were rubbed on slightly before grilling.. I thought it tasted alright, although the hubby wasn't too thrilled with it. It's definitely not something I'd look for again, though. I had the non-vegetarian omelette of the day ($12).. which tasted like it was cooked on the same surface as a lot of other dishes prepared that day, without washing it out even a bit. It was smaller, and, just from the looks - I've gotten a better-looking omelette from Denny's. It tasted pretty ok, although I don't usually think of short beans when it comes to breakfast omelettes.   Overall... Would I come back here for breakfast/brunch? Maybe to try their pancakes. That's probably about it."}
{"text":"I've been to Six Penn a couple of times for lunch and dinner now.  It's a nice spot, but not the top of the list.  If you are looking for some \"home\" cooking it's a good choice.  The food isn't anything to brag about and it isn't too inexpensive, but I wouldn't count it out.  The rooftop bar is nice, private and more of an outdoor lounge.  It is actually comfortable to sit rather than most outdoor places in the city they just use metal patio chairs."}
{"text":"Two of the four meals were excellent, two were definitely sub par. Service was barely above adequate. Cocktails were ordered and two were excellent and two not made as ordered. We ordered Johnny Walker Black with a twist, and no twist was provided. One dish was trout over potatoes and vegetables with a cooked egg on top. The waiter assured us the egg breaking over the fish really \"made\" dish. However, when I received the dish the egg yoke was solid. When he pointed this out to the waiter he said, \"Oh, sorry\", and that was it. We also had their most expensive steak which was supposed to be served with a sauce, but the sauce was not on the steak. We pointed this out to the waiter and he said \"I noticed that when I picked it up\" but went ahead and served it anyway. This was a meal to congratulate my guest on some accomplishments, but the service and errors on the meals kind of put a damper on the festivities. At this point, I would be hard pressed to return to Six Penn."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for what we thought was a nice high class date night. While the layout and décor of the restaurant was great and led to high hopes, the food left us wanting. We ordered the buffalo chicken tacos for an appetizer, the chicken was dry and it was just so spicey you couldn't taste anything else. I ordered the mixed seafood pasta (can't remember the exact name), while the pasta was homemade, it was not my favorite. The sauce had a weird taste to it which left me a little queasy. My boyfriend ordered a burger (some sort of barbeque thing) which he liked, but it was just okay for the price. The one thing we had that we LOVED was the creamed corn with cojita cheese (a must try if you go!). Besides the corn however, the food was way overpriced for what you got. You could spend just as much of not less at a much better restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice spot in the heart of the Cultural District.  By avoiding the theater rush on a weeknight, we had a lovely meal with very attentive service.  The pace of the meal was perfect, and the chilled soup and strawberry mojitos hit the spot on a warm summer night.  There were many other dishes on the menu that looked amazing, though, so I'll definitely have to visit again."}
{"text":"I have been to this places many times and enjoyed it, but today the service was not so good. I hate to write reviews about the place being bad, but this needs to be said.  When we got in, the hostess sat us behind a table with a big crowd. There were plenty of other tables where we could have sat. The booths were all taken so we stuck with our table. The waiter took forever to come plus the hostess gave us the wrong menu when the waiter came to take our order. After he gave us the right menu, the party next to us hovered over us when our appetizer came out. I asked politely for them to please move and they did respectfully. Bread with vinegar was served to us and shortly after our food was brought out. I had a Caesar salad, my husband had the downtown burger entree. Both meals were good, and we got mint chocolate when our check came out.   Overall, I liked the food but the atmosphere is so much better during the work week around lunch time. I'll have to come back then to really enjoy it."}
