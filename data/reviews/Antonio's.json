{"text":"So I just finished my Antonio's pizza and was not impressed. Sadly I was disappointed by the quality of the pizza and how much this place is loved in Cleveland. I'm a new york pizza kind of girl so I was expecting really good Italian pizza based on what I heard on yelp. This pizza was average like pizza hut average. The sauce was super sweet and the onions I ordered were cut randomly and huge. Overall ny experiment of Antonio's pizza was \"I'm never ordering this pizza again\". And to all you NYC pizza loving foodies out there don't bother with this sweet bread like so called \"pizza\"."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian that has been around for years.   The decore could use a bit of updating & the entire establishment can use a good cleaning.   The hostesses and servers are always friendly and knowledgeable about the food served.   Living on the west side of Cleveland most of my life this is a favored spot for pizza and salad.   

When friends come to town who now live in other parts of the country, this place is a must for them.   We've never had a  experience, highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place props for consistency:  Service was good, as usual; pepperoni rolls were overcooked, as usual; the pizza takes forever to come out, as usual; the cheese pizza is excellent (I mean VERY good) as usual; the selection of other pizza toppings (outside of the sausage) aren't very good and the beer selection (especially the draft beers) are even worse.  (Oh and don't order the deep dish, it's a dreadful joke).

It's aggevating because this place is really close to being really great, but it seems content to coast by on it's past reputation."}
{"text":"Cleveland has incredible food, I believe because of it's unique distance from New York and Chicago.  I live in SoCal now, and the pizza is worthless.  Antonio's and their perfect sauce and incredible dough and crust will forever be in my dreams.  If you like their pizza, we will be friends.  This pizza and Angelo's are the best pizza shops I've ever been to, and I'm relatively well travelled.  Try the sausage pizza and antipasto salad.  If i still lived here, i'd be 300lbs."}
{"text":"The wait staff are always unfriendly.  No smiles, no personality, pompous, make you feel as if its a privilege to be there.  Had to prompt my waitress for everything including my drink refills.  The hostesses barely greet and seat you and forget about them saying goodbye.  The experience isnt worth the big bucks they charge."}
{"text":"I love Antonios take out, but going into the restaurant to eat is less than impressive. Service is scattered and so, so at best. Took my daughter in law there for her birthday on Sunday afternoon,the place was empty. Appetizers came out fairly quickly, were good. Pizza came out within 20-25 mins afterward. 30 minutes after the pizzas came out, were still waiting for our dinner orders. Really?  So you bring out half of the tables food, then send the rest of the food 30 minutes later? Finally, we get our dinner orders and guess what, they are luke warm ! Yeah, that was worth the wait!  I dunno about you, but I like my spaghetti and meatballs hot. We had a $100 check and we were there 2 hours trying to get our food. With all the other restaurants opening in the area, I would think they would want to keep their customer base.  This isn't the first time the service was bad, but I can assure you it will be the last. There are too many other places I can spend my money."}
{"text":"There is no doubt that their food is good, but one has to wonder what takes the kitchen so long to send their food out.  Then, we stood up to leave, and the bus boy was clearing the table before we even stepped away.  We had to go around him to leave.  Was not the best experiemce.  Especially for the price."}
{"text":"Not what I remembered from 20 years ago. Placed is worn and torn. Wait staff is amateur hour. No specials?  Come on. Every Italian place has nightly specials. Found spaghetti pasta in my ravioli. My dinner partner was a pesky fly that would not go away. It's January for goodness sake. They must live there. 
Too bad it's gone downhill."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time based on some of the reviews. I love pizza and I don't mind driving a distance for a great pizza. I live about a half hour away, passing about 50 pizza joints along the way to try this. First impression is that it is dated! My wife and I felt we were back in the 70's! They even had 70's music when we were there. Restaurant Impossible would have had a field day with the old decor and dated furnishings. The service was passable, server never introduced herself. Came to us immediately and asked what we wanted to drink. Not a friendly way to start our dinner. We got sat at a table with the ceiling fan that was blowing very hard and made for an uncomfortable experience, luckily we were able to move. The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, salad was okay, nothing to brag about. We ordered a large pepperoni and onions pizza. Pizza tasted very good, sauce was good, dough was a little tasteless though. Overall, based on this experience, I don't think this is a place I would go out of my way to eat. If I would live in the area, I would get the pizza as a carryout only. Decor and service is not enticing and because of it, I am not compelled to return anytime soon. I am happy that the place has a loyal following but they need to get with the times."}
{"text":"From out of town in just for the day buying a car it was my birthday and was looking for something Italian but not chain, just happen to drive by and stop for my birthday lunch, fresh clean and hearty tastes great service and the price can't be beat. I suggest to anyone not from the area to stop by and try well worth it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant--they have the best pizza anywhere!  Anytime i'm back in Cleveland, I go to Antonio's at ParmaTown Mall.  I always order the pizza-their italian sausage is the best!  I also recommend their salad.  It has loads of mozzarella and crisp pepperoni on top, not to mention their house italian dressing!  I grew up eating this stuff and I haven't found better yet!"}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice for lunch.....  Fantastic Idea...  Plus its the biggest piece of pizza you could imagine.  Well worth the $2-$2.50 price.  If you go please try the Sausage it is fantastic.  I also am excited cause they are building one in Macedonia right on 82 and 8.  I must also say their chicken is also delicious.  I remember when I was a kid going to Parmatown Mall Food Court for me it was Antonio's..  What can I say I am a pizza junkie....."}
{"text":"Pizza pizza pizza.... Was expecting a lot more out of it with all the reviews and Drew Carey newspaper article. It wasn't that it was actually bad pizza, but if I weren't reviewing this restaurant, and anyone asked my about good pizza in the Cleveland area, I don't even think I would think of this place, yet alone say it out loud. I had sausage and onion, and there was very little of either topping on there, and what there was was just OK. The pizza was not that big for the price, which is OK if its a great pie, but it was just a doughy mess. This is the second time I have ever been to Antonio's, and I will probably give the pizza one more chance like a bad ex that you know your just going to be disappointed in the long run, but it could be good, so why not give it one last try. 

I went with 3 others, and tried the Antonio's trio, which had the lasagna which was great, and shells and fettuccine Alfredo. Of the three things I tried, I would order the lasagna again for sure, but don't really care too much for the alfredo sauce, as it seemed a bit like wallpaper paste in consistency. The server was very polite, and attentive, which is all I really can ask for in a server. My secong biggest problem with the place, after the pizza is very trivial: the glasses. I watched my 10 year old niece go thru 6 glasses, sounds like a lot til you see the glasses. They must be 6 ounces or so before you put any ice in them. Not only was it a pain in the ass for us, and I imagine all guests, but must really suck for the servers, expecially when you get someone who is over ten and very thirsty. Tjhe veal Marsala was said to be very good, but could have been a bit bigger portion size, though the entrees do come with a salad."}
{"text":"A Parma and Greater Cleveland institution.  Let me get right down to it, so you don't waste precious time trying to decide what to order.  Order a large sausage and pepperoni pie, a large Antonio's salad with the house dressing, and an order of the pepperoni nuggets-your welcome."}
{"text":"Rude service. Good food but we got our food thrown at us. Dirty Plates piled everywhere."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out. Got 2 pizzas and the salad with house dressing. Everything was good. One note: they locations have different ingredients so make sure when you order to clarify what goes on the salads/pizzas."}
{"text":"I hoped for a good meal..don't remember the name of the pasta dish I ordered...it had shrimp, clams, sea food...the pasta was pasty..the sauce was watery and wasjkust plain bad...
If I wasn't visiting my mother at a nearby hospital...I would have spoken to manager....

I don't enjoy trashing a place..but this had to be worst meal I have been in a long time!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza from here tonight.  It tasted great, however it was radically UNDERCOOKED.  The dough was still stretchy and raw.  We called and let them know about it.  They didn't even offer to give us another pizza.  Boo hiss on them."}
{"text":"i can't believe I've not written a review of Antonio's until now. 
I'm going to keep it short. 
I've never had the pizza - at least as far as i know
Aside from my sister's home made meatballs, theirs are my favorite. I've tried meatballs at every Italian restaurant i've been to and I maintain that Antonio's are the best. Danielle even got me 2 dozen or so for my birthday last year.
it's been a while since she and i went to Antonio's but I look forward to going again soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza! Good price and taste really good a little greasy but good for when your craving a good old fashioned pizza the wings are pretty good to and a good price! Love the mild sauce definitely will be going again! My first time there in over 20 yrs idk why I waited so long. Had to try it it is a staple in parma definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Our group of nine was seated quickly on a Saturday night.  Our waitress was nice and our bread and appetizers came out quickly.  

The Chicago deep dish pizza was really good and had a lot on it!  It was almost like a lasagna the way it was layered with cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and onions.  Each slice was really heavy, and so delicious.   

A lot of my friends ordered pasta dishes and were very happy with their meals as well!

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty pizza but I sure wouldn't do what Drew Carey did.  It definitely doesn't warrant that sort of treatment.  I actually preferred Romito's in Independence over this place.  Still if you're in the area I wouldn't pass this place up."}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner here a few years ago and I really enjoy coming here for dinner.  For our rehearsal dinner they were really great.  We could have 3 items on the menu for guests to choose from and it included salad, bread, and a non alcoholic beverage for a flat price.  We could even bring in our own dessert.  I think their eggplant parmesean is the best I've ever had.  Service has always been great too.  Definitely consider booking them for a private party!"}
{"text":"While I do not miss Cleveland's weather, or sucky economy, I can truly say that I miss Antonio's. And it's not because of the pizza (although it's very good). If there is one thing that I am in love with it is....wait for it....their salad, and most importantly, their 'signature' dressing. If I could drink it directly out of the bottle, I would. Except that it costs $5.00 each, and living in North Carolina, I don't have as easy access to it as I would like. I'm pretty sure that my husband, being from Toledo, thinks I'm crazy about how much I love their dressing, but willingly lets me buy ten bottles each time we visit. 

Honestly though, Antonio's pretty much define's West Cleveland to me, period. So GO NOW!"}
{"text":"I would give this a 41/2 if possible.  The pizza and antipasta is really good, can't speak to anything else on the menu.  The crust is amazing, a little chewy and dense.  One of my favorite pizzas in the Cleveland area.  Service was ok and there were employees smoking outside the front door, but not the end of the world."}
{"text":"It used to be fantastic, but the last couple of visits the food was average at best. I got a small deluxe pizza last time not much cheese or sauce. It was also lukewarm. Then the second visit recently, I got stuffed manicotti with chicken and spinach (mine looked nothing like the previous picture posted on here, that is how it used to look) again lukewarm, minimal sauce and not a lot of cheese. Another thing inside the restroom stalls they were very dusty, they need a good cleaning.
I hope they get there act back together because this place is a Parma family tradition for many people, and I want them to continue for many, many years."}
{"text":"In business it is all about how managers and owners handle dissatisfied customers. Everyone knows how much the service industry level has decreased. My boyfriend and I are very happy to recognize Alicia and her family who owns/runs such a customer friendly restaurant. We had an issue one time there and we were more than happy with the resolution. If you haven't tried it here I suggest you Do! Excellent management/ownership and great food!"}
{"text":"I really don't know what it is about Ohio pizza but nobody can seem to get it right. Le sigh...the pizza was a giant mound of dough followed by a blob of cheese that was pulley, the sauce tasted like ragu which I wouldn't be surprised if it was. Their cheesy garlic bread was actually really good( I was happy about this) their salad options were minimal. It was a nice atmosphere tho, it's a nice family place, has tons of potential to be something better but they need a revamp of the menu, recipes and definitely wait staff. If you're close by and hungry for doughy pizza this is your spot, otherwise you'd be just as fine with little Caesars"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had another fantastic Pizza from Antonio's at this location.  We occasionally have pizza from various locations, both in Cleveland and around the country and this this pizza is the best.

A travel suggestion for Cleveland Yelp readers:

What we do if we are coming home from a trip and our plane arrives in the evening, is we call Antonio's from the airport after we have our bags and put our order in.  It takes about 15 min to drive there, so when we arrive the pizza is just about to come out of the oven for us!    Try it!"}
{"text":"It's old people food. Plain and simply said. It's bland, overcooked, and boring. I wouldn't go back.

Edit: after tasting Parma Hospital's food, I'd recommend being admitted there and eating before going to Antonio's. It's sad when hospital food is more flavorful than this place."}
{"text":"Hiding in the little strip sharing a parking lot with what used to be ParmaTown mall is a pizza shop pretty famous among the people of Parma.  Walking in, I definitely wouldn't be impressed with the decor, which is kind of brown and drab, but the overwhelming smell of pizza wafting through the air blocks out the other senses and makes your mouth water. 

I decided to go for the basics and what makes this place famous (like I have probably every single time I've been here) and got the Antonio's salad and pizza.  The salad is huge (definitely enough for sharing) and is piled high with cheese and fried pepperoni (extra saltiness and crunch-yum!).  The pizza is delicious... The perfect thickness of crust paired with a thick layer of gooey cheese.  The one complaint I could make is that there is a little too much sauce for my taste, but that's easily fixable with a little squeezing!

The waitress we had was a little strange... Very friendly but almost hovered around us just watching.  I'd gladly deal with her again just because the food is MUCH better when you eat in here than when you order to go."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I've lived here all my life, and Antonio's is my favorite! It's very consistent, even the newer takeout locations. The main Parma restaurant is nice for eating in. It's not cheap, but it's worth it for the quality!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza! Great salads and awesome Italian dressing. I always buy a bottle to take home. Prices are a little higher than the big pizza chains but worth every bite."}
{"text":"Good food and service.....only negative I'd say would be ditch the iceberg lettuce for something better otherwise everything was great."}
{"text":"We just had our baby shower in the back bar area today. My wife and I were very excited as we are expecting our first baby. Antonio's exceeded our expectations! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the food was fantastic as always, and the old school vibe fit our style perfectly. We had about 40 in attendance and the set up in the back area was quite conducive to this type and size of event. We usually get pick-up from the Broadview Hts. location but will most definitely take a ride to eat here in the future. What a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Every bit as good every time. The staff is very experienced and takes great care of you. The quantity of good for the buck it's good but the quality is even better. Although I rarely make it past the pizza party of the menu, the pasta is just as good

The secret to the food are the sauces. You can cover up almost any part of pizza if one thing is so - so, but a great sauce is the greatest part. The pizza has real cheeses on it and is cooked in wheel style oven in really old pans. Yes, that matters. Come here and find out why. The Mariana sauce is best stuff they got (for $5 you can take home a quart and act like you can cook! ).The sampler, lasagne, abd asleep street just safe choices, they are best choices beside pizza."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! We were seated right a way, our waitress was named Carla, she was super friendly,

We ordered chili (9/10 love the kick), calamari (9/10 love the sweet marinara sauce) and the meat lovers pizza (8/10 amazing)

We will definitely be back :-)"}
{"text":"I've been here and taken out dinner from here many times and I love it the service Is good in the testers the but takeout isn't. Although the takeout food service isn't very good we still love it and we will always order here when we are thinking pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Yup, I finally made it to the Italian joint that's famous from Drew Carey's humongous pizza order shipped to LA. 

Except, you know what? I didn't order the pizza. I know, right? 

I actually had the lunch portion of angel hair pasta and a side salad. Adventurous, I know, but that's what I like. It was good too!

Hey, I love me some 'zza and maybe I would have been a little more impressed if I had ordered what makes them famous. But it's not like I didn't like my food, I've just had better. On a positive note, this would be a great place to take the kids. They have the perfect spacing between tables and well, they're just kid-proof all around. 

Our server was quite interesting too. Imagine a high school wrestler trying to make some money after school, but more interested in the younger girls sitting behind us. Trust me dude, they might give you their number but they'll most likely ignore your calls and I'll tip better anyways. 

I think I'd like to try this place again when I'm going to order some pizza. I've heard way too much about it not to give it a shot. I'll most likely get it to go though, so I don't have to worry about the waiter disappearing on us. 

Something to think about: Their signature house dressing is actually pretty sweet for a vinaigrette, so keep that in mind. I much prefer tangy over sweet on my salad."}
{"text":"The service was great.  The food was really good.  My bf also loved his food.  We had a great experience here and would defenitely come here again.  

We didn't have pizza last night, but heard it was good and got it to-go last week.  It was great!  A tad on the expensive side.  But good!"}
{"text":"OK let me start by saying that I'm from Chicago so I've had some great pizza.  This pizza is just alright.  I've read reviews that this place was the best pizza in Cleveland.  The dough seemed under cooked/soggy . The sausage did taste good but everything else was just bland.  For the price I expect way better. A large was small.  Costumer service didn't seem that great.  Called at 8:30 on Sunday night asking if we could dine in and they said only delivery or carry out.  So we place an order for carry out.  When we arrive a gentleman asked if we wanted to dine in.  That sucked because we had to drive 20 minutes back to the hotel"}
{"text":"This landmark restaurant has recently been remodeled and looks great. The pizza is the best as are the salads and their house made salad dressings. Our server has been at Antonios for 25 years and she was terrific. We love their carry out locations but occasionally a visit to their restaurant is a special treat."}
{"text":"The pizza is sooooo delicious and the service was okay. What I don't understand is why there are so many fruit flies. It's pretty disgusting. The place looks pretty clean. I grew up going to Antonio's and this has been a problem for a while. They really need to take care of this. The good is already good."}
{"text":"great food, but on our last trip there we ordered salads, beers and a large mushroom, sausage,pepperoni pizza...pizza arrived to our table and I noticed a curly dark hair on the cheese...it took a minute to debate just not eating that piece, but then I brought it to our servers attention...she said they would bake another one and it would be ready in 25 minutes, but during the servers discussion with the kitchen manager I saw him shake his head like we were causing him problems....we promptly just declined the new pizza, paid our tab for salads and beers, left a tip, and left...this place is a Parma staple and their pizza rates a 9/10 but after that fiasco I will never return...I still give this place 4 stars,because the pizza is great,accidents do happen, and I have dined their at least 50 times since 1991 with no previous complaints...."}
{"text":"Great pizza at this location. I am not sure why but this location the food taste better then others. Place is dated inside and needs updating but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. One of the very few good things left standing in Parma.

I've been here too many times to count, but I can't remember having a bad meal in 25+ years. My wife and I had our rehearsal dinner here, I've ordered off of their catering menu for a few parties, and I've had their pizza ever since I could remember. Some of my favorites are the Pepperoni Nuggets which are awesome, their Rigatoni with meat sauce, the Chicken Marsala, the Palermo Pizza, their straight Cheese Pizza is one of the best, and I can't forget  my favorite salad dressing--the House dressing (Yes, the salad dressing.)

If you have a taste for Italian food, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a Parma legend, being around for a long time.  I would say there is a lot good, and a lot not so much.  First the good:  Their pizza is special.  Nice variety.  Fresh toppings, generously applied.  Their deep dish is filling, but not the best (hard to find good deep dish in Cleveland, though).  Their salads are OK, but their salad dressing is special.  They sell it by the bottle, and it is worth buying.  Then there is the rest.  There are multiple locations in Parma, but this is the only one with a dining room and a menu including more than pizza.  Their menu features your basic pastas with either marinara or alfredo sauce.  Both are extremely heavy.  Pastas a nicely made and portions are generous.  There are no light Italian entrees, unless you count the salads.  Service was a bit slow, and less than attentive.  So in summary, you can't go wrong ordering carry out pizza, but you can find a better dining room experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing we had a deep dish and normal pizza it was wonderful, the staff was great ... And the house dressing is great!!!!!"}
{"text":"So I grew up on this stuff....Antonio's Pizza.  I loved this stuff before Drew Carey gave it his seal of approval.  
 It all started in a little Italian family restaurant in \"Snowville\" in Parma for me.  They moved across the street and expanded quite a bit.  This was the place my family went as a kid, it was the place we Holy Namers always went after our high school games.  It is where I go now for CONSISTENTLY Great Memories and great pizza.
 First off, I must clarify my review is based pretty 90% on their pizza...sure they have other stuff, but is it great?  Some yes (try for one Muffalatta) others no (say salad, always been white iceberg less than appealing, however their grated mozzarella and pepper is a good cover up)
 I can describe their pizza and what makes it so good....For me it's always a deluxe....GREAT freshly baked pizza dough and perfectly crunchy to bite yet soft to chew crust...A well done sauce, and great toppings.  I always to opt for Extra cheese.  No pizza place anywhere ever gives you enough cheese on any pizza.  Fresh pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions finish quite well.  Soft chewy warm.  Dough you can taste and that tastes good.  This is fantastic.  From time to time I will get one of the other types of pizzas but the deluxe is by far my favorite.  Fresh ingredients (except for mushrooms) make this excellent.
 Another of their lesser known treats is their Chicago Deep Dish.  Not many places can pull it off like Antonio's; even the Chicagoans have forgotten what a pizza PIE is.  
 Overall to sum it up, this has been my lifetime favorite.  In fact it's the pizza I compare all pizzas too.  Thank you to the LoSchiavo family for your great product!"}

{"text":"I've been wanting to try Antonio's for awhile now and when a relative suggested we meetup for 'Pizza and salad' I was semi-enthused.  Salads don't really get my motor running if you know what I mean. 

Right when we walked in I noticed something.  When was the last time you went to a restaurant and smelled the food?  I can't remember.  The smell of Italian cuisine and pizza was amazing.

We ordered a antipasta salad that was supposed to feed four.   It was huge.   I never in a million years thought these words would ever come from my mouth,  but they did: \"That was a delicious salad\".  I'm not saying it turned me vegetarian or would make me consider salads as real food...  but it was very good!    We had on it their Antonio's Italian dressing and it had a unique sweetness to it.   The salads eggs,  ham,  and olives were yummy.  

The pizza was good, the service was friendly. I'm looking forward to going back and trying something else SOON."}
{"text":"After 15 years in Parma I finally stopped in tonight.
Haven't had *normal* pizza in a long time. 
The Flavor of sauce and cheese is good but too doughy for me. If you like pan this is good za but ill pass on this. If this was a thin pizza I'd give it 5 Stars  but 4 isn't bad, right? lol"}
{"text":"Ok.  I always thought pizza was about the same everywhere.  I was wrong. This place is fantastic.  I tried the Palermo and the Chicago Deep Dish.   Wow. Both were absolutely great.  Bring a big appetite because the portions are enough to feed a small army.  The waitress was wonderful so ask for Barb when you are in.   Really, don't skip the place!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Parma this past weekend and took my wife out for her birthday as she likes Italian food. Well, I got the gift this food was on point and all of the sauces I had kick butt.  Service was friendly, fast and attentive.  This place beats any chain restaurant in quality, quantity and service. A++++++++++++"}
{"text":"Every time we come here we have a great experience. Everybody talks about the pizza but I order the Antipasti salad and cheese cake on take out all the time. Tonight we did pasta! Chicken and Spinach Manicotti was bubbling when it hit the table and The scallop & Shrimp Parmesan was delicious. Nick did a great job with the service! He was fast, friendly and attentive. Didn't have room for dessert this time so we'll be back."}
{"text":"The best pizza in greater Cleveland! I understand when my good friends that once lived in the Metropolis of Parma come here right off the airplane and directly to Antonio's. 

Their homemade salad dressings are absolutely the best. You can buy a bottle to go at the restaurant. I really love their Italian dressing. It is sweet and tangy and just divine. Order the Antonio's Special Salad with fried pepperoni and cheese on iceberg lettuce. 


We had their BBQ chicken wings as an appetizer and I would rank them a 9 plus. They were perfectly cooked. 

Their pizza is honest as the day is long. It is how pizza should be made with care, love and the finest ingredients.

Carry on Antonio's and the LoSchavio family. You do food the right way!"}
{"text":"Food is great. People not so much. Took my son in for lunch one afternoon. Was using a gift card purchased at a satellite location. They gave me the hardest time..wouldn't honor it. I was left feeling embarrassed and confused as to why I was getting such a hard time and what did I do wring? The card did say \"Antonio's\". I caught the waitress and hostess laughing. I called their corporate office to let them know how about my experience and how they made me feel. They've gotten so big they don't seem to care about the \"little guy\". Haven't been back since..."}
{"text":"There's a reason Drew Carey get this pizza sent to him. It's the best, the salad dressing is great too!"}
{"text":"Always good but slightly higher priced for pizza and spaghetti. Great deep dish pie and son loves the wings. They need to send out coupons. The ones that come are never good at the Parmatown restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our whole family's favorite pizza and this location does make a very good pizza to go. When any of out Adult children come in from out-of-town they always want to pick up a pizza here on the way home from the airport. The only knock I may have is that sometimes it is not quite up to the norm taste-wize, but still very good."}
{"text":"Food was just ok and the service was awful. Our waitress came right out and told us don't expect your food anytime soon we're very busy. Who says that to a customer? We didn't even say anything. She also never smiled. We had to ask another waitress for drink refills. Won't be back."}
{"text":"my 5 stars are for the pizza alone (full disclosure .. I have never tried anything else other than the dinner salad & some desserts) .. their sausage is worth the wait for a seat when busy & wait for the pizza to be done .. my favorite combo is the sausage + pepperoni + onion .. the decor can use some updating but I can overlook that for what I call the best pizza in Cleveland .. no doubt about it .. this is also the go to place when we have pizza lunches at work .. well worth the added price vs going to the many chains around the workplace"}
{"text":"When I'm looking for pizza that tastes a little more homemade than Pizza Hut (my chain-restaurant pizza of choice), I get Antonio's.  Their pizza has never disappointed me, and the people that work at the Broadview Heights location are friendly.  I only had a time-issue with them on the day of the Super Bowl - I showed up on time and had to wait about 25 minutes, but I guess I'm willing to forgive that.  All other pick ups were ready on time.  I'm crazy about cheese and they use a LOT of it on their pizzas, so it's pretty much a match made in heaven.

Note: this isn't a dine-in place.  They have one table inside, and I think it's merely decorative.  I think the one in Parma is the only dine-in."}
{"text":"Tried pizza and salad again.  Missed the mark with our order. I want to like it but i didnt....salad was soggy and pizza order wrong.i understand you premake items but the antipasta salad was wilted and old .for $22 it blows that they don't care. Im not coming back.   Its outdated. ..you cant order online at this location. ..its 2016!!!"}
{"text":"There is no such thing as bad pizza, but when contrasted to other options in the area, I would pass this stuff aside."}
{"text":"Best pizza you will ever have!  The sauce is perfection, the dough is fresh, not too thin and not too thick.  There is always a perfect amount of cheese and toppings.  I have lived in NYC, LA, and everything in between and this is the best pizza, hands down.  
There house salad dressing is so delicious.  A little sweetness and a little tang.  Lots of herbs.  They sell it in the bottle so I always get one for home.  
If you don't want pizza, I highly recommend the meatball sub with melted cheese on top and a little extra sauce on the side.  (Just because the sauce that good, you might want extra.)"}
{"text":"This place has been around for what seems like forever and they still get it right.  When you first walk in, you notice the recent remodeling at the entrance and the new addition they added on the side.  The new addition includes more tables and chairs.  Most of the other tables seem to be the originals with the cheap plastic top.  This kind of adds to the charm of the place.  We always order their house salad with house dressing and large pizza with banana peppers.  In my opinion, their pizza is top three in the city.  The crust, cheese and sauce all mix together really well and deliver a wonderful finished product.  My family and I have frequented antonio's many times and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"The food is typically pretty good. The restaurant is always packed. Take-out needs improvement in understanding what items are on the menu and how to ring things in correctly and Antonio's restaurant has a fly issue they really need to solve.... but other than that, you can't go wrong with dinner here."}
{"text":"Literally the best pizza in Cleveland. My family frequents this place for large party get-togethers and the food and service is always top notch. 

Do not skip the antipasto salad. My boyfriend and I love it but fight over which dressing is best. He's a fan of their house Italian,which I'll happily admit is delicious, but oh my that poppy seed dressing is life changing. I have an uncle who visits from Texas twice a year, and every time he brings a case of poppy seed dressing back home cause it's unlike any other.

Now for the real show: the pizza. Their dough is so fresh and soft yet crispy, I literally don't know how they do it. The sauce is perfect, the cheese always melted just right, and so many toppings everyone will be happy. I highly suggest a white pizza with garlic sauce topped with spinach and banana peppers. Ahhmazing.

The staff is very polite and know the menu well. They have always been very accommodating when our group of 20 calls for reservations. It's casual dining in a slightly fancy setting, reasonably priced. Perfect."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pepperoni and medium veggie. Total came to $32.50. Seemed pretty steep to me for pizza. (living in Akron, I'm used to luigi's pizza) food delivered a few minutes late. The pep was not worth the money, but the veggie was pretty good. Expensive for pizza."}
{"text":"Most people who grew up or live in the Parma area swear that Antonio's is the best pizza in Cleveland. I don't know about that. It does have a loyal following and people go nuts over it. I do like it. I guess it is some of the best pizza around. If there were a Cleveland style, Antonio's or Danny Boys is probably what I would say sets the bar. The bar inside is pretty cool to drink at. My only gripe with Antonio's is that every one makes a huge deal about it."}
{"text":"7:30 Monday night. Called in our order to Antonio's located in the Shoppes at Parma. We ordered a Deep dish pizza for 16.50, and Antonio's combo for 14.75.

I want to start the review by saying that the Deep dish pizza was PRE MADE and we could not add or subtract from it, Although it was good, this completely killed it for me and there is no way I would consider coming here again, as I do not play the pre-made pizza hut game, it has no place in the \"authentic italian food\" scene if you ask me.

Now on to the Antonio's combo - Again The wife called in the order at 7:30, and got there very early at around 7:40 (ten minutes later). She immediately noticed that there was a to-go order sitting there the entire time she was waiting. Turns out 20 minutes later as they brought the pizza out it was in fact our COLD Antonio's combo. So apparently this is a big microwave pizza place, and to top it all off, the timing was so bad that ended with half of our order @ room temperature.....unbelievable! And all this for 32 bucks??"}
{"text":"We had my wedding reception here last night and it was amazing...
  The food was outstanding..
The whole staff was so nice..
It's a family owned restaurant and they made us feel like family
    I would recommend this place for a party or just to stop in for lunch or dinner..
You can't go wrong with Antonio's and I am so glad we picked them for the special day"}
{"text":"The pizza here is phenomenal.  They use old style pizza ovens that the branch locations of Antonio's don't have.  If you've tried any of the branch locations and have been underwhelmed, you need to try the 'main' spot at Parmatown.

With that said -- the decor is stale.  The prices are fair, not great.

If you want great pizza, great salad (try their house dressing, probably the best Italian i've ever had), etc this is the place.  If you're trying to impress a date or guests from out of town, you may want to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is by far our most fave place to get pizza. We've been here dozens of times over the years. Their special salad with cheese and pepperoni with their own dressing is a great start before the pizza comes out. The only times we've had to wait a little longer to be served was when the place was completely busy. Again the waitstaff are usually attentive and offer drink refills to tide one over.  Love their crust dipped in ranch dressing - so good!"}
