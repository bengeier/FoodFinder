{"text":"Absolutely loved this venue! I went last night to listen to some Latin Jazz and we had a great time! It was a little tricky finding the place, but once we found and walked down to the basement, we loved the atmosphere! Hidden gem to say the least... Awesome vibes!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite bar in the downtown area. Its as if you've been transported to your Uncle's favorite basement. Accompanied by the furniture, wall paper and bar games he refuses to donate to Goodwill. And it wouldnt be the same without em. 

What keeps me coming back is the eclectic mix of music that can be played on any given night. Everything from New Wave, Cumbia, Classic Rock, Indie/Alternative, Banda.. You name it, they'll play it. 

Sometimes its a sardine can and it can become a little bit claustrophobic but who cares, suck it up and be thankful Downtown Phoenix has given us a reason to steer clear of Mill Ave and Old Town Scottsdale. 

Bonus Points but important to note: My respect goes out to the bartenders of Valley Bar. Its always a crazy busy shitshow no matter which night I go and it always seems like they maintain their professionalism and get me a drink in a matter of seconds. 

If you're in the mood to bar hop, bounce on over to the Crescent Ballroom. Its run by the same people who opened up Valley Bar. ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Feels like a bar in Chicago, New York or Boston not new shiny Phoenix. I think that's the fun part about valley bar. The entrance is in a stinky alley and the bar is below a building. But once inside, it is packed with people every weekend. They've got a great cocktail menu named after different Phoenix \"celebs\" like the McCain and some old school arcade games. But what gets this place the 5 stars is their stage. A revolving list of live acts play at the valley bar that compare to the acts that come to crescent ballroom."}
{"text":"awesome venue....Im a new yorker and have been to my share of clubs and Valley bar is quite a find!!! In the back alley off central  - down a flight of steps into a softly lit, welcoming venue with great acoustics.   I went to see live jazz with 12 guests and we were all blown away.  Waitress was accommodating and made us feel well taken care of.  Will go to this bar again and again.   A memorable night! BRAVO to Valley Bar!!!"}
{"text":"Cool location. Drinks are good and reasonably priced. They seem to have a nice variety of beers on tap along with bottles and cans. The arcade area is fun, though it's easy to blow through a few dollars in as many minutes. Live music is another draw for this place. Haven't eaten here but friends say the food is great."}
{"text":"I will start this out by saying, as of today no response from the venue. This place used to be my absolute favorite spot in Phoenix to hang out with a good amount of fun dance nights and bands, however on Friday we had an absolutely AWFUL experience. See below.

We had reserved tables for Friday night. We got in nice and early, made sure we were good to go and started drinking right away. We were not particularly rowdy or crazy. People had come up all night attempting to sit at our tables, noticed the signs, said something (sorry or whatever, no biggie either way) and leave our tables, no harm no foul. 

Well, another couple came up, and were lingering near the table looking at the reserved signs and appearing to be frustrated or upset. To be fair it was dark, and to be fair it was loud, but I asked if there was a problem. They didn't say anything to me, and continued to hover, so I again I asked (perhaps I was being unpleasant at this point?) if there was a problem. The woman immediately jumped to say \"if we wanted to keep our tables we would calm down\". Now at this point I didn't know they were owners or anyone, but regardless that made me more upset so I again said \"So we have a problem?\" She continued to say calm down, and they both walked off. No explanation no nothing. 

I was confused and upset at that point but whatever, sometimes people are people. I offhandedly ranted to our waitress (who by the way was FANTASTIC, kind and knowledgeable, I believe her name was Danielle) and she informed me it was the owner. She apologized, told everyone to just hang and enjoy their drinks and that, I thought, was that.
I got up to go to the restroom and when I returned, my party informed me that the owner had returned and was looking for me. Another person in my party said he even spent a little time explaining that he was certain it was a misunderstanding. 

I thought maybe if he came around again, we could discuss what likely WAS just misunderstanding, we could smooth it out and laugh it off, but instead he and another waitress not involved at all came over and he started with \"Why you gotta be like that?!\" which immediately put me on the defensive. I tried to explain what I had interpreted as him and the other person being rude about the seating arrangement we had called ahead for far in advance and secured. He said that I was the one who was immediately \"aggressive\" and that I was \"puffing my chest out\". When I asked if that was any way to speak to a customer, the waitress not involved stated \"the customer is not always right\" and when I said that's true when people are being shitty, she said \"we don't want shitty people in here\". The owner then waved it off and stormed away. 

We settled up our tab, and left. I tried to speak with him one last time, to try and apologize if I was being aggressive and hopefully just call it whatever, but he had left. After all that, he took off.

In conclusion, if you like Valley Bar, beware, the owner apparently does not care for reservations on Fridays, and doesn't handle conflict resolution well. I would gladly continue my patronage if we can both agree that the initial exchange was more than likely just both sides misreading the other, and if he will apologize for he and his staff accusing an otherwise normal, respectful group of paying customers \"shitty people\". If not, I will encourage my friends and anyone else I know to avoid the place, because that is no way to treat someone, especially when it was so silly."}
{"text":"Hands down my new favorite spot! Their Soul night is so awesome and you can always find a table to chill at with friends. Love everything from the hidden room to the shuffle board to the great crafted drinks. This is my new night out top pick."}
{"text":"Let's set the scene.. 3 months ago, my friend went, had a great night, and her debit card was mixed up with someone else's. No big deal, it's a busy spot and mistakes happen. She had no problem getting it sorted out with her bank, and tried to contact the bar to make them aware of the mistake but never heard back. We went back this weekend for the first time, we're having a great time and she mentioned it to the waitress in a totally just making conversation kind of way. 5 minutes later we were kicked out by security. I'm not saying something fishy is going on, but why would we get kicked out for #1 something that happened months ago and #2 just making them aware of the mistake.. shame on you Valley Bar"}
{"text":"Super cool venue - went for a concert with my daughter. Can't comment on the drink service or quality, but the Music Hall is really a neat place to listen to music."}
{"text":"Speakeasy bar with a comfortable chill feel. YUP, this is the place to go. I absolutely loved this place. The service is great and they work quick. I'm a big lover for secret hidden gems and this is literally hidden. It is down an alley and in a basement. It has local beers on tap and great cocktails with an awesome vibe. Also they have live bands which is so cool!"}
{"text":"Cool place. Friendly. Go here for a great night out, awesome music on the dance floor. Food quite expenisive."}
{"text":"We went here for a bachelorette party as our first stop. The bouncer wouldn't let us in and was quite rude about it. One of the girls in our party accidentally tripped in her high heels. Apparently mistakes like this in 6inch heels are grounds for not allowing someone in. Don't waste your time or money here... Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm a bit embarrassed to say that I've worked in downtown Phoenix for nearly 15 years had never been here before.  Alley entrance, down some stairs, low lights, comfortable speakeasy vibe, perfection.  I'll have to stop in at least once a week from now on . . . and you should too!"}
{"text":"Was good until I got yelled at for going to the bathroom with my sister. They banged on the door and made me exit until she was finished.  Weird."}
{"text":"Do enjoy the Big Labowski touches...however, they don't usually open until 4pm, food service doesn't start until 5 or later & you can get cheaper drinks down the street"}
{"text":"Funn.  Always fun.  Always have a good band or dj and quick to get a drink.  Ive only paid a cover once here and been atleast twenty times.  Went this past weekend and danced all night.  Went to leave and my Boyfriend realized he lost his glasses.  when we tried to go back in to get them they were so organized they said clear ray bans?  and then brought them up within two minutes.  Where else would care or be so organized?  Best bar in phoenix!"}
{"text":"This must be the worst bar that I have ever been in great place if you looking for hookers though service is terrible as the food"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! This place is for everyone. Kudos to the owners and whoever decided to put this place here. Its such a cool location and the vibe is awesome. The back room is great and the live music with latin bands is my favorite. I think its friday night. The back room is super cool with old school video games. I wish the skeeball beer machine worked better. Cool place to get a drink and hang out with friends. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Valley Bar reminds me of the hip bars you can find hidden in Chicago. I went on a Tuesday night and it was sexy poppin, and yes I just used the word sexy poppin with no g to describe this place. 
It's officially in my top 3 fav bars. Oh and on Mondays they have free games!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to go in downtown Phoenix. I absolutely love the decor, specifically of the Rose Room (especially the references to Winnie Ruth Judd haha) and the seating arrangement is nice because it has some degree of intimacy and the music is always fantastic. They always have different special events and musicians performing throughout the week which are a blast to attend (especially Ladies 80s!) I've never had a bad experience with any of the staff either; they're all a bunch of very cool people who do their job well. They also have a little game room with ski ball, pinball, pool, darts, and board games! As of a few months ago they changed up their food menu and started serving flatbreads, which I must say, are the most delicious god damn thing on this side of the Mississippi. Especially the chorizo flatbread (you can make it veggie chorizo for no charge!) 

But perhaps the best thing about this place is......you don't have to deal with assholes you would deal with at a sports bar."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. Craft cocktails are amazing. Skeeball, pinball and pool gives you something to do while you are getting silly drunk. Oh yeah, old school dartboards too."}
{"text":"Our pedi-cab/tuctuc recommended as we were leaving Lucky Strike and wanted a fun bar to go to.  One side had a live bar with  Latin music.   Other side had cozy booths where you could grab childhood board games and play.  Jessica was our bartender and she was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Is it the vintage games? the inexpensive tall-boys? the eclectic selection of djs and bands that slink through town? It's all of the above and more in this downtown speakeasy. Top notch staff and guaranteed good times... What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Fantastic 'hideaway' in downtown Phoenix. Staff was friendly and the atmosphere relaxed. I loved the happy menu and prices. Charcuterie and craft beer were excellent and I highly recommend the Italian sandwich. I will be back."}
{"text":"Very cool bar! But this review actually reflects the food menu. Do yourself a favor and order the Valley Cristo sandwich and the cinnamon roll. BEYOND DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"So this is just TOO FUN. My husband had been craving Short Leash Hot Dogs for a while and wanted to know where to find them. A quick search brought up Valley Bar - the union of SLHD and a bigshot from The Crescent Ballroom - our favorite venue. My husband, a remodeler and plumber by trade, and all things music aficionado the other 16 hours a day, was beyond delighted.

He took off work early and told me to doll up. We ate a late lunch at the Crescent Ballroom (Salmon Salad gives me life) and tried to find Valley Bar on Waze. Now, because I am extremely observant, as he sat in the car and tried to type onto a small screen with big man hands, I noticed someone walking down the street with a \"Valley Bar\" shirt on. I asked my husband to inquire for directions. He grunted. Men don't DO that, woman. So I put down my window and called the guy over. Apparently, women DO that. 

We still had trouble. It's just something NEW to wrap your head around, that's all. We found the alley and descended into Valley Bar.

Did I say it was fun? Because that is an understatement. Its patron saint is a murderess. Above the bar is a murder mobile. It's macabre and a bit disconcerting, but that's what booze is for. 

Did I say it was cold? That would also be an understatement. We sat at a few tables to find the least drafty one. I held my hands over the little candle flame and whimpered. 

We ordered doughnuts and something alcoholic. Our waiter was pleasant, funny, and extremely mellow. We gently reminded him of our orders and had to follow him to get the check. But he loved talking about the bar, and really, the entire experience is what matters. I liked him. The world has enough smart asses, amirite?

I kicked my husband's butt at skiball. Twice. He tilted the Addams Family pinball machine and I acted like I didn't know him. 

The doughnuts arrived. They were different. I noticed right away that they had a more bagel like texture and density. It was pleasant. I think that in the future we will try to have our entire meal here instead of just dessert.

The place was slowly filling and we knew it was time to go. Looking forward to visiting frequently and even bringing our teens to the concerts. Gotta raise them right!"}
{"text":"Discovered this gem during the Downtown Music Stroll. 5-star ambiance, great drink list. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Been here twice, Cool atmosphere.  it was nifty.  Recommended to check it out."}
{"text":"Cool bar . The bald door man with the beard is a jack ass though. He was incredibly rude to my friends and I for no reason . Almost threatening. Hope it made him feel better to pick on a group of WOMEN ."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great staff, great vibes. There's a bar, a game room, a little cozy library vibe, and a dance floor. Something for whatever you like. A good clientele mix, wasn't stacked full of trashy 21 year old college students. Will be going back regularly."}
{"text":"I attempted to go Valley Bar after the St.Vincent show. After a couple of the doors guys passed around my drivers license and meticulously examined it, they decided I can't enter. I asked why and it was pretty obvious they made up an excuse and said I was swerving in line, despite the fact that I had 1 tall beer earlier at The Van Buren and and I carry a pocket breathalyzer. I used to frequent this bar quite often, but I guess I'm not hipster enough to go inside anymore."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place.   Hidden in an alley, it might be easy to miss but that's part of the charm.  I was going to see a show at the music hall but my friends and I got there early and decided to grab a few drinks and something to eat. The brussel sprouts, bacon and egg flatbread is life changing.  I stuck with my trusted vodka soda but my friemd ordered the McCain and that was delicious.  The Music Hall is s fun place to watch smaller bands."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is just amazing and the music and venues are great! Best happy hour can't beat it love the atmosphere and design the place has going on!"}
{"text":"Best of the best. If you are in Phoenix you need to stop by. The food is delicious. The service is awesome. The place is super cool. The location is super origina. The music is super cool. The ambiance is unique. Please stop by. We love coming here!!"}
{"text":"Hip. The separate restaurant/bar and music venue is a great setup. In the actual basement, there is always a cool underground basement band vibe to music acts. Food is pretty good with some uniqueness. Drinks are pretty typical. But with, what must be, the best bar chandelier/light/shadow box thingy in town, and a great atmosphere, The Valley Bar is capable of providing a fun full night-out all under one basement roof."}
{"text":"Valley bar gives you the feeling you are in a New York Venue but the Arizona themed drink menu reminds you otherwise. This new basement venue has that freshly cut wood smell and excellent decor. With two rooms, the lounge and the performance area.  

We tried the lounge first and found a comfy booth to relax and sip our drinks till performance time. I ordered a Kate & Rueben, the drink was refreshing, a decent size and not overly priced.  I loved the variety of latin music playing which ranged from Salsa to Spanish Rock and Cumbia to Mambo. The lounge has a gaming area with darts, pin ball machines and a  game that resembled table bowling.

After finished our drinks we went to the performance area, note to all no glass in that area. I liked the how raw and intimate the room was. We went on opening night to see LA Orkesta formerly know as Sergio Mendoza and the Orkesta. It was a great way to kick off the opening of this venue  and I know I will be returning! I can't wait to see how this place evovles!"}
{"text":"Live music. Check. Games. Check. Solid drinks. Check. All in all Valley Bar is worth the sketchy ally and sometimes cover. DJ's alternate so music isn't always my taste. 4/5 times the crowd is cool. If you go on an off night it just gets weird. Worth a roll of a dice and play cards against humanity."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place.  Good beer list and cocktails and a terrific vibe/setting.  There was a DJ in the main room playing a nice mix of music at the perfect background volume.  Very cool spot."}
{"text":"First, I'll start off by saying I am no fan off Arizona, so we know that I am definitely not favorably biased. This is this best bar I've been too in quite some time. The music is incredible, the decor is outstanding, the drinks are inventive, and the food is weirdly (can you say turkey and cheese on a hot doughnut) awesome. I've been coming to Phoenix for year now and this is by far the best place, and now the only place, to go for a drink and a bite. While I am old for the demographic, they made me feel welcome, and the general vibe of the place is so different than this downtown area.  If you are in Downtown/Central City, and you like bars go here."}
{"text":"The boy and I popped in here after a late night dinner on a Saturday. This place is tucked away down a borderline creepy alley in downtown Phoenix, however, once you step in side, fun is awaiting. Very lowkey spot, but all the people are not pretentious and no one is trying too hard. The music was PHENOMENAL with the afrobeats night, and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Major yes- Emily *our drink angel* approached us in line at the bar and offered to grab us drinks.  We were nicely buzzed from bitter & twisted and thought we had a 20 minute wait judging from the crowd. Luckily we were wrong.

I love divey bars that encourage fun group activity!  The best part is that actually has class with a sophisticated yet reasonably priced cocktail menu.

We grabbed a booth near the Skeeball and actually got friendly interaction and more cocktail servers asking if we needed anything.

This place is literally by a dumpster but don't let that fool you! Descend into your alcohol induced fairy land.

My friend and I loved the bar shadow art installation and historical painting of the first female AZ governor."}
{"text":"Fantastic new bar in Phoenix. Go on Monday nights to play games for free. Fridays and Saturdays get busy very fast, arrive early and kick your friends' butts at Jenga and pinball!"}
{"text":"What phoenix needs.  The bartenders, too, are quite gregarious and certainly 'spirited' with their libation creations."}
{"text":"So last night was my wife's birthday, and thought it would be a great idea to take her and some of her girlfriends to your bar. We frequently visit valley bar for music and have never had a bad experience, but.....last night your door guy told my wife's friend that she was too fat and old to come into your bar!! He also stated to her that she had small breasts!! Wtf!!! He wouldn't tell us his name to handle this problem with management he told our group to fuck off and many other obscene hateful words directed to the ladies in our group!! We asked to speak with management your door guy refused and threatened my wife and 3 friends with force not cool at all!!!! This was the start of our night! Thanks to your ego maniac door guy who threatens girls!!! And say's sexually inappropriate comments to them!"}
{"text":"Bouncer was very rude.  It's a bad place when a bar becomes too cool for its patrons. I do not recommend this place unless you are the kind of person that generally wakes up angry everyday and is still pissed about a conflict from high school."}
{"text":"Met some friends for drinks and some games. The bar is very cold. I wish I had a sweatshirt, lucky for me I was able to find a nice leather chair that was located under the AC unit and next to a fan..needless to stay I stayed comfortable.

The bar is nice, the aesthetic is vintage. I live what they did with the bar, very nice touch.

I was longing for more video games, the one pinball game was lacking but doesn't really matter.

Did I mention they were playing LCD Soundsytem when we came in? Gotta love that!

Great bar/music venue, make sure you check it out when downtown!!"}
{"text":"Quick service.  Awesome, eclectic decor.  Feel good environment. Music room, game room, and sweet ass sitting room. Happiness. Love it."}
{"text":"By far most impressive bar I've seen in Phoenix in a while! Definitely a great place for live music and fun! I will definitely go back and recommend to others. If your looking for a great place to socialize in a laid back environment then look no more!! This is the place to be seen!! Fantastic speak easy to hang out!!! Games, lounge, music, and great people!!"}
{"text":"We normally head here for cocktails with the girls. It's a small basement bar that gets really busy. But they do offer really good drinks and it's a fun place to meet new people and check out a small live show."}
{"text":"The vibe down here is just giving me the creeps but soo free spirited, hipster, comfortable, happy and a mix of other good emotions. On a Tuesday night, its perfect to sit with friends or a date and grab a few drinks and sure why not,bar foods too. Personally me, this place is a basement one of a kind in downtown Phoenix. All I can say is, I love it!"}
{"text":"You have to walk through a dark alleyway that smells like piss, and if they are busy, you are waiting in that alley with those smells. Way too pricey, and service is awful."}
{"text":"Cool place to go to at 7 pm on a Saturday night.  Location and vibe adds something missing from DT Phoenix.  4/5 due to the bartender thinking he's hot shit.  I'm ok with paying $8 for a good cocktail in a very small glass, but please don't fill it half way because you messed up on pouring it in the shaker.  Having quarters at a place that has video games, pool, and darts would be nice too.  Bar and quarter machine was out.  The front door staff does their job, but they're actually cool and respectful about it.  Refreshing..."}
{"text":"Love this place and how cool it makes you feel going through an alley to get in :) going down the steps your unsure of what it will look like and become pleasantly surprised with all the fun decor! Love the bar area and the animated merry round thing that displays all sorts of fun things. If you walk past the bar and to the right, you will discover all sorts of fun games to play, including my personal favorite shuffle board. 

They have plenty of seating but it does get busy as the night continues so you may have to stand, which you can preoccupy yourself with pool, shuffle board, etc. The only con was I haven't had a good specialty cocktail from here, which is disappointing, so I end up sticking to a simple drink. Aside from that service is always great & it's a fun place for you to end up at!"}
{"text":"Yay!

My friend and I were visiting AZ for a weekend and we met up with some locals who suggested Valley Bar for some libations.

This is a cute little place. It's a bit difficult to find (you have to go to the back of the building and then walk down a flight of stairs) but that's part of its charm.

I love the display above the bar with the animated shadows and the ambiance is comfortable but also kind of hipster-y chic.

I had their classic margarita, which was made with fresh lime juice. It was well-made; there was no gut-punching boozy bite and instead it was nice and smooth with a good balance of sweet and citrus.

The food menu looked pretty good; maybe next time."}
{"text":"Pretty Awesome place. 1 It's hard to find.  2 The bouncers have zero personality 3 The sound is atrocious and 4 They charged my card twice! The only positive thing I can say is that the artichoke dip was pretty good."}
{"text":"Valley Bar is a hidden gem! This place is so fun with several different areas to hang out in. Drinks are bomb and service is great! Must try!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Valley Bar.  I loved the ambiance and the many different rooms and décor. Like many other reviews, the walk down the dark alley was a little daunting; especially when you are a female.
     I was very excited to see the event posting because of my passion and love for 80's New Wave music. I invited others to go to this event because we saw the great music layout.
When we first arrived, we heard some great music playing and saw the old music videos playing. 
     After about the 4th song, the music and energy excitement went down hill. 
DJ Tristan started playing \"radio versions\" of the old music. The most frustrating part is when I started watching him DJ...he spent most of his time picking out cd's out of his CD book. No B-sides, No WaxTrax, Dubmixes... or pretty much ANY remixes were played. A DJ myself for many years, I was getting frustrated that he didn't bridge or fade his music well. His BPM's were all over the map. 
     Any person can pull CD's out of a book.
     The most frightening part is they put on some ridiculous British scary movie in the background so your view for the evening was a bald ugly \"Uncle Fester\" like character on the screen.
     Valley Bar... love the building (except all the spilled water/drinks on the floor...might want to clean that up before someone falls and has an accident.
     Was going to bring more people July 29th but not after that \"NO ENERGY\" DJ music."}
{"text":"Stopped here from Chicago since I had 3 hour layover, nice chill atmosphere. Friendly bartenders. It was kind of hidden around the back a building a little hard to find but over all great place to relax for a drink."}
{"text":"Love this bar, Ryan knows every drink concoction possible, and the manager Dave really knows how to treat patrons of Valley Bar!  I can't wait to get all of my friends down to this bar..."}
{"text":"Really cool place! It's a speakeasy and it was actually kind of fun trying to find this place.

They have an assortment of games in the back like shuffleboard, billiards, and other arcade games. Lots of seating and really nice candle lit tables/booths. Would recommend for a wonderful time!

Their drinks are pretty good as well! Place can get crowded, but service was still great! Also, drinks are not a bad price and actually cheaper than what I'm used to."}
{"text":"The vibe here is great. I love that they host local & national acts. Just a fun atmosphere/décor.

The drinks are a play on local politicians which is fun. I do miss Short Leash hot dogs being above but the apps we've tried since their departure have been really yummy. 

The restrooms are always clean & there's always a place to be unlike other bars around town. So that's a bonus. The crowd is good mix of everybody which makes it fun too. I always have a good time here."}
{"text":"Seriously .. what's not to like about this place!

It's in an alley .. Yes .. The alley isn't that dark or dirty ... it's a quick walk from the street to the door so no worries!!

Awesome .. I mean awesome tunes .. anything from Fela Kuti, Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings, James Brown, Hall & Oates .. just really good tunes!

The drinks are handcrafted .. fancy - like!  My favorite times to go are Sunday evenings .. Happy hour all day .. $5 Slow and Low Old Fashioned

Really cool places to enjoy a drink with friends or throw a couple back with your boo ;)"}
{"text":"I talked up place to my friends who were first timers to be met with disappointment. Some of these reviews are a little over the top maybe people that don't go out very many places? However my biggest issue is in regards to the management of this venue. They obviously feel that treating people in adequately is acceptable. Bars open and close everyday. You would think for owners who have been in this business for a while could get it together knowing what's going to happen. The obvious issue is there is no time management in regards to switching out bands having a line in the alley is ridiculous especially in this heat. I really liked it when I went the first time as there was no line no need for a line and the venue was free all of the sudden two weeks later there's a line and a charge. If I wanted to do that I go out to Scottsdale which is what I don't do. I won't go on the weekends- maybe during the week. .the only reason I did wait is  because I'd taken my friends to see the Latin cafe. The band is worth $3 cover... however standing around in this heat,  forget it... nothing is worth that. Then when you're standing out in line the smoking area is right where the line is at . My understanding is that smokers have to be at least 20 feet away from the door ~that needs to be addressed. I should not be forced into second hand smoke for smokers convenience. The door man told me I had to move further away. REALLY? ? They need to work out the kinks in regards to having a better system in place it's not like it's a big surprise that they have bands playing. what drew me was the fact there was no line & no cover. THAT'S what made it cool. So unfortunately probably won't be back. The band was really good though."}
{"text":"Favorite bar in Downtown! A bartender down the street recommended this bar for my group and we were so glad she did! Darts, shuffle board and great bourbon selection... We had a blast here and would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting"}
{"text":"Ultimate weird kid bar in the best way! If you're into funk pop dance parties and disco night, this is your place. They have less loud sit-down areas as well as a \"hidden room\" for those looking to talk to their party. Valley Bar also has a ton of events and actually updates the calendar on their website, including whether there's a cover or not."}
{"text":"The staff was courteous and that's why it is getting 2 stars. Went for a show. Stuck outside for 15 min checking ids. Then have to get id verified again to get into bar causing me to miss half of the opening act (the reason I bought tickets). Not only was the venue overcrowded but you couldn't get to the bar. Couldn't even see the stage and the doors kept opening and closing which distracted me from being able to hear when I couldn't see. The bartenders had time to sit on the bar and watch the show since they couldn't serve anyone. Left without seeing the rest of the show. Thank goodness Seamus McCaffrey's was across the street. Don't know if I'll return."}
{"text":"Cool bar! Fun mix of people, lots of games (board, ski ball, pool, pin ball, darts etc) to keep everyone entertained. Drinks were great, nice beer selection with a rotation of draft beers, and creative cocktails. If you like spicy you gotta try the 99 to Fife cocktail- yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is wild.  Getting inside can be challenging, as the only entrance is in the back, in a dingy alleyway.  You'll know you've finally found the right door when you see the tiny neon sign over it and (probably) the bouncer out front.  Then up the industrial-looking stairs, a left turn and suddenly you're in this super-cool bar.

The AZ-themed cocktails are all well-crafted and interesting; some classics, some original.  The food menu, by Short Leash Hot Dogs, is as good as expected.  And the interior of the place has no end of things to look at."}
{"text":"What a fun bar in the heart of downtown Phoenix! For starters, this place is very difficult to find. It's literally down an alley behind an inconspicuous door that looks like it might as well be a freight entrance to a corporate building. And the bar itself is in the basement of the building, making it even more challenging to find. Fortunately, my wife and I had some expert guides when we visited this place, as my cousins had been here many times before and knew exactly where to park and where to go.

When you do end up finding your way downstairs to the bar, you'll be impressed by the comfortable ambiance and the unexpectedly large size of this place (there are several rooms, including a retro arcade, which I highly recommend checking out!). The bar is dimly lit and includes an assortment of high-top tables, bar seating and sofa chairs and couches with coffee tables. That being said, the night we visited was quite busy, so a table is not always guaranteed.

The occasion for this particular visit was Seinfeld trivia night. Unfortunately, both my wife and I know hardly anything about Seinfeld, but my cousins and their friends (who are big fans of the sitcom), gave the other teams a run for their money (side note: if you are a Seinfeld fan, this trivia night is incredibly specific and ridiculously difficult according to my cousins who are very knowledgeable about this show, so if you're looking for a fun challenge, I'd recommend giving this a shot... just don't be disappointed by the serious competition).

As my cousins were answering trivia questions, my wife and I were enjoying some fine food and drink. In particular, we ordered a Castro Margarita, Dos Cabezas red blend, Arizona salad and Caprese flatbread. My wife thought the Castro Margarita was \"ok\" and the Arizona salad was \"too spicy\" (it does have a bit of a kick from the Chipotle dressing, but if you like spice, you'll really enjoy this salad... the ingredients were really fresh). Meanwhile, I thought the Dos Cabezas red blend was a good glass of wine (not great though) and the Caprese flatbread was DELICIOUS (this is coming from a New Yorker). Don't be fooled, though, the menu at this place is EXTENSIVE. There are a LOT of options for drinks and quite a few options for food (all of which I am told is quite tasty).

Service here is also terrific! Despite the very crowded Seinfeld trivia night, our waitress stopped by our table often to check in and was both friendly and efficient. She also asked on a few occasions if we needed new drinks but never was pushy. What I also found useful was the fact that there were barrels of water at the bar (self-serve style) so we didn't need to wait for our waitress to come back for water refills (important in the desert).

Overall, we really enjoyed Valley Bar. The food was delicious, the drink options plentiful, the ambiance fun and spacious, and the service terrific. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time I'd was hands down THE BEST BAR in Arizona. Second time a kill joy. 

Second time, the DJ blew so much I had to write a review. Complete kill joy. Couldn't gage the crowd and play anything substantial. No one was dancing. Get rid of the 1 star car Dj and someone that can make the crowd move. We were TRYING to dance but the lack of good music was so hard. We even jumped on stage to get everyone going then told to GTFO. Dam, well this place blew. To the security, if no one in the crowd is dancing your DJ blows a fat one. I ask to Dj my backseat car skills would blown this Dj out if the water. 

In short, come on Valley..... sub par sub par

With love,

Fire the half staff shit Dj and this bar would be awesome. She didn't even have RIPE the band you are hosting next week.... ? 

Get with it"}
{"text":"What a surprise. We had friends in town and wanted to show them something cool in Phoenix. We decided to go here. One thing to note, you have to walk through an alley to get to the door but it is for sure worth it. We get inside, get some drinks, pretty reasonably priced I might add. We sit down, chatting and then I thought of exploring the whole venue which we all thought was just a small room. I turn the corner and there are more tables, ski ball, pool table and couches. So there was a whole other portion to take part in and as I walked further I could hear live music, there was a whole other room that was a concert venue playing soul music. It was an AWESOME night with chill people. 

CHECK OUT THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Did not get to go inside. We were visiting from California and saw that people thought well of this bar. It took ever to find (which was tight). We ended up in a dark black ally where there was a door entrance in...... okay why the hell am I taking the time to write all this... 

They did not let us in because my friend had a Film Camera. However they said we can take as many pictures as we want but we can't bring the FILM camera in because it of \"Policy\". HOW DOES HIS MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL?????? Hate it. Come on guys we had like 10 people deep and u won't let us in because we had a film camera but we are able to take as many pictures on or iPhone which actually produces better pictures and accessible to instantly post on the internet. Get it together this bar was weak."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of those East-coast, speakeasy basement bars. Although it has a bit of a dungeon vibe since it was humid (for Arizona), dark, and hot. Patron ages ranged from young 20's to mid-40's. You have your choice of a dance floor with its own separate bar, a section for games (pool, skee ball, darts, shuffle board), and a separate bar/table area. You can take drinks from the dance floor bar over to the other bar area, but only if it's in a plastic cup. There is a spot at the very back that's set up like a living room with a couch, floor lamp, and coffee table. I was with a group of six, so it was the perfect area to sit and play board games. I do wish it wasn't so dark and loud in the 'game' area because it was pretty difficult to see the game pieces, or hear anyone more than 1 foot away. They do have some great vegan snack options, including cashew mozzarella cheese to swap on the flat bread items (hurray!). The waiter was really consistent and constantly came back to make sure we had plenty of food and drinks, so we never had to wade through the crowd and wait at the bar to order. I'd recommend this for a casual night out, but make sure you wear light clothing so you're not sweating profusely!"}
{"text":"Bouncers get power hungry and will randomly turn people away at the door for no good reason. Scroll through the comments and you'll see dozens of examples.

What happened to me: 
Two friends and I show up in the alleyway of an entrance where there's zero line. One friend goes straight to the bouncer who checks his ID, other friend walks around the railing that's set up for when a line forms. I just wait behind the friend talking to the bouncer b/c there's no line - what's the point of walking around the railing?

About eight people show up at once from the other direction. Now the bouncers tell me to go around the railing. I say okay - kind of ridiculous that they just let eight people cut me, but whatever. I wait, guy checks my ID and says to hand it to the other bouncer. That bouncer accuses me of being \"too intoxicated\" (I day drank earlier but hadn't drank in about 5 hours at this point). First bouncer says they were blocking me because I \"failed to follow basic instruction\" because of the railing thing. I did follow their instructions. Maybe they'd said it earlier and was talking to someone and didn't hear. Idk. Still an absurd reason.

We went to two other bars and were accepted no problem and served politely by workers who know what customer service is. None of these bouncers/servers thought I was too drunk.

Again, look through reviews and you'll find dozens more of the same. Sounds like bouncers just get bored and want to pick on people. Sad way to run a business.

Not sure I'll ever go back. We'll see. If you do decide to go, have a backup plan in place in case the bouncers deem you unacceptable. And don't be surprised if you get treated like sh**.

Oh, and a friend said he knew someone who got in while on acid once. So great job there, bouncers. Good consistency."}
{"text":"New favorite small live show venue for sure.  We caught the Dry River Yacht Club here a week or so back and really had an awesome time.  After hearing nothing but muddy and poorly mixed sound at my last three shows elsewhere I almost wanted to kiss the sound man mid way through the show for the job he was doing.  If you haven't caught them DRYC has some pretty dynamic instruments, wild vocals from a range and volume perspective and a tone of horn, wind, and percussion.  Not an easy deal to mix but this was the clearest and most incredible mixed sound I've heard in ages.  Nice work sound dude!

As for the place itself it is pretty interesting.  I won't go into the specifics but check out the photos and you will see what I mean.  Cool, weird, dark, chill, with a speakeasy type vibe.  The crowd was cool and I was delighted to find a great bar and well represented beer list.  Did I mention they have Fresh Squeezed IPA on tap? Holy Mother that made me happy.  Moscow mules were good and drink prices didn't gouge you.  

Service was great and although it was pretty busy I never waited for a drink.

Just be sure if you are going here you know where you are going.  It is in a back alley way that though feels sketchy it just fine.   

Get your asses out to places like this and support the local music scene. $12 shows are an amazing value over the $125 mega shows that suck and if we don't support our local scene we will remain one of the worst musical big cities in the US. Get out and support em!"}
{"text":"Our server Sophie was awesome! Came here for Valentine's day and had a great time- food and drink was wonderful as well as service."}
{"text":"Probably the best hidden gem down town! Such a fun atmosphere to come with a group of friends. You always walk out with more friends than you came with. Jenga and chex mix is just an added bonus!"}
{"text":"Super cool place. Drinks and food were good and reasonably priced. No complaints. Good time."}
{"text":"Valley Bar has been on our list of places to try for a few years now, so we were very excited to finally make it in. It has a very real speakeasy vibe to it. You enter from an alleyway behind the actual address of the bar, and it's in the basement of the building. It's dark, dimly lit, and actually pretty sparse in terms of the decor. It's definitely a no fuss type of atmosphere where good drinks are the emphasis, and boy were they.

I happen to not be a big fan of mezcal, but my husband ordered a spicy mezcal cocktail and I loved it so much I ended up changing my order! It was incredibly balanced - nothing was overpowering anything else. Exactly as a cocktail should be.

To top it off, our server was amazing. We put in some food, and after about 20 minutes our server came over to apologize for the wait - one of the chefs hadn't shown up for his shift so all of the servers were actually pitching in to help the other chef get the orders out. He ended up comping us all of our food (something he absolutely did not have to do) and was incredibly nice and attentive our entire stay. We will definitely be back again for some live music!"}
{"text":"I love valley bar but last night I went after seeing a show at the van buren. We were told that we would get 15% off at crescent and valley bar before and after the show. The bartender had no idea about the discount with tickets, was kind of rude, and basically said she couldn't do anything because she didn't know anything about it. If you're offering a deal make sure the bartenders know what's going on."}
{"text":"Sophie, our waitress was delightful and incredibly helpful and polite.  She made excellent recommendations for my gf and I on Valentine's day. I definitely recommend going to valley bar (especially when Sophie is working)!"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that we found this bar in an alley which was super sketch, this place is the place to be. Love coming here on weekends. Bartenders and security are super laid back and chill, all around fun place to make a stop at for drinks on Friday or Saturday night. Be sure to check out who they have playing at their venue right in the same location, although some shows you have to pay to get in to!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, I've heard good things about this bar but from my experience I would not recommend this establishment. I was denied access because I resembled some other people that had stumbled past their bar earlier in the night that seemed intoxicated. Even upon speaking to the manger they refused to let us in because \"people that had similar outfits to ours had been flagged not to be let in\". I understand that businesses, especially bars need to take precautions but in this situation I felt like it was unnecessary, distasteful and pretty rude."}
{"text":"Decent venue. It was fun until we got kicked out right before the artist we wanted to see just cuz some pissed off bouncer on garbage duty. Apparently we didn't move out the way of his garbage can quick enough."}
{"text":"I love Valley Bar. I've been here two or three times, now. It's down a sketchy, unmarked alley, but once you find it it's so worth it. It's got that old-fashioned speakeasy feel. Super fun drinks, good snacks, and fun music. Check the schedule before you go, because sometimes you need tickets to get into the attached club."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp. It a really cool spot. You have to go down an alley to find it and it's in the basement of a building but don't let that deter you. It's really cool and off the beaten path. The service was great and our group had a great time. Drinks were inexpensive and good in my opinion."}
{"text":"New to Phoenix and this Speakeasy-like bar was MY JAM. The place was packed on the Saturday night I went but I would definitely go back!

We took the light rail to downtown Phoenix. There are three different rooms to the Valley Bar. Chill room, dancey room , and arcade room. Special drinks to this specific bar. I had some espresso flavored beer, super good if you like coffee stout."}
{"text":"Wow, did we love this place! Drinks were reasonably priced, very good and our sausage,  and tomatillo flatbread was amazing.  The bartenders were also very nice.

I am a Los Angeles woman and thought this place was so cool! I am so glad we didn't want to pay stupid prices for drinks at the Hyatt (where we were staying) and ventured out. Walking through dark alleys at night, in a strange town was a little scary for us but also an adventure.  We saw the Valley Bar on our Waze and followed the directions.  We had no idea we were in store for such a great place.  I want to come back to Phoenix so we can go back again."}
{"text":"Five stars for the originality of this place. Its decor is playful and kitschy. Mobiles hanging with light behind it for shadow play. The place has multiple areas like a house. There's a bar, then restaurant, bathroom, game room, and stage for live music. 

There's tons of board games but unfortunately some pieces are missing. I'd imagine that would be the case since people are drinking when they play them. There is a shuffleboard table and some dart boards, you just have to ask for the pieces at the bar. 

I accidentally came across this place one Saturday night adventuring downtown with a date. The game room was too crowded to enjoy and that night there was a DJ instead of live music. 

I would suggest coming here for dinner and games on a week night or maybe for a show to be able to best enjoy it. They have a schedule online, Hang the DJ does New Wave nights every six weeks. Also, the Sausage and Tomatillos flatbread is delicious and $10."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out. This bar is for all ages. One side was a dance bar and other side was sit down bar with games. The people were a different mix. This is a casual bar for sure. Had a good time"}
{"text":"You can't really say you don't charge a cover and then once people get downstairs you demand a $3 donation. I have no problem paying a cover, or even donating to charity but don't be shady about it and at least give someone a receipt. Non-taxable donation=aka cover charge."}
{"text":"We were in town for a night and came to this place for a few drinks and really enjoyed it.  The vibe was fun and the service was good.  They had live music for an extra charge so we just headed for the bar.  It didn't take more than a few minutes for a server to approach us and take our drink orders, our server was attentive and such a sweetheart.  We split the chorizo and poblano flatbread which was super tasty, would recommend it!  They had some interesting drinks to choose from and a decent selection.  I'm a cider fan and they had one of my favorite ciders so I was happy.  Before we left we headed to the restroom where we saw all the games they had, which we would have seen them sooner so we could play!  I would definitely stop by here again if I were in town!"}
{"text":"This is really fun place to hit on the weekends! There is little to no cover and the cover is usually going to a charity of some sort. Drinks and good and there are two big rooms- one more chill and a more dancy room. Definitely a place to consider if you're going out in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Classy basement spot. Standing and room to move, the stage is small. The atmosphere is super cool. 

There was games like pool and skeeball in the back area. 
There's big leather couches and sitting room for busy nights too. 

They also have board games and the general vibe is cool and dark."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident - thankfully the \"smoking man\" out front told us the place was in the alleyway. You might have to hold your nose as you make your way through the very \"ripe\" smell from homeless and/or drunk dumpster urine deposits and your eyes will need to adjust so you can safely descend into this dark cool sanctuary but it is totally worth it. 

The bartenders are attentive and make great drinks. Good beer options. Great music. And a really really unusual visual display over the bar. It's an art installation that's a rotating shadow show of sorts and quite intriguing. 

There's a real nice mix of customers and some cool artwork on the walls. Not sure what the cover charge is for shows - we just had one quick drink at the bar - but the musician we heard warming up at the piano in the hall sounded incredible."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It was nice visiting from out of town and coming to a place that had a diverse mix of people and played great music on one side and was chill on the other."}
{"text":"Oh the Valley Bar I want to love you so much but my last experience soured me so bad that I am not sure if I will be back. I now have been twice to go to the Blunt Club night because for me it is like a family reunion.  I have been going to Blunt since it started 13 years ago.  I am also one of those people that show up around 9 because I have 2 businesses to run and I can't get all crazy and party all night so I always cab it there and cab it home because I live close and want to be home by midnight. So with that being said let me tell you of my experience.  I get there, order a vodka tonic and a glass of water.  It has become the norm for me to get a glass of water with any alcoholic beverage to stave off a hangover and keep myself hydrated if I am going to be dancing, which I was doing quite a bit of.  An hour or so later I order my second drink, which the bartender says it was on him.  We had been having great conversations and I thought it was sweet so I of course tipped him well.  I ran into so many friends it was amazing and I was overjoyed.  I bought a Stella for one of my friends and another  glass of water for me since I wasn't done with my second drink.  Ran into another friend so I got us Fireball shots.  So at this point over 3 hours I has 2 vodka tonics and 1 shot plus tons of water. As I was standing at the bar for the last time 2 very drunk girls, who I didn't know, were being super obnoxious, grabbing my ass and all sorts of inappropriate behavior.  As I tried to be nice and get them to stop I tried to talk them out of getting more drinks and just getting water, which they did. Now here is where I have a huge issue, I ordered another drink for myself and was DENIED!!  When I asked why the answer was I had orders 5 drinks already so far.  This isn't a lie, I did, but out of those 5, over the span of 3 hours I had 2 vodka tonics, 1 shot and 3 glasses of water.  The other 2 that I paid for were for friends.   When I explained this to the only bartender that had been serving me all night and the bouncer who I hadn't even seen before they were so dismissive it was not only infuriating but embarrassing, I even told them I wasn't driving if that was there concern and the best I got was a nope sorry and some stupid hand wave.  I went to my group of friends to say goodbye and let them know what happened.  They were all so pissed and even offered to undercover get me another drink.  But you know what, it didn't matter,  getting the drink wasn't important.  Being treated like a piece of shit was. So I left, went across the street to another bar who not only gladly served me but kept their kitchen open a little longer so I could get some food to take home. I don't know if I will ever come back.  If I do it will be for the Blunt Club night only.  And I know sure as shit I won't be my charming self and give my business to only one bartender.  I will make sure I am all stealthy and go to the two different bars if I decide to consume more that 3 measly drinks over 3 hours.  So Valley Bar I know you are the new cool kid on the block right now but I have lived here for 27 years and know a lot of people.  I will be sure to let them know how much you sucked for me last night."}
{"text":"Guys with man buns sporting beards, the ladies wearing plaids and overalls. The DJ is playing mashup genre from the 40's, 50's, 60's coexist with current top 40 music. And wait there's more, a music room for bands to play indie reggae with electronic beat.  Where am I? This is not a bar in Scottsdale. It's located in downtown Phoenix.
 
X marks the spot. Curiosity sparked my interest to find this place. Follow the crowd of people going into a alley. It's scary at first but the part of the unknown and yet to come. It's a good indicator you are close to the bar. 

The bar/lounge have the ambience of combination of artsy, hipster and indie crowd. No fancy decorations but fun old school games. I like the most about this bar is the music venue and anvangarde of authenticity."}
{"text":"Valley bar is the next evolution in a downtown bar/music venue/multi-use space (well, to Phoenix). It is located on Monroe in downtown Phoenix across the street from Seamus Mccafrey's. Situated in in alley there is usually a reasonably formed line to get in, do not be discouraged though, the function of the line is not to weed out the losers but rather to keep the occupancy in check as the place is situated in a basement (a very large basement). Be cool and you will be fine.

There is so much going on here it can be easy to miss stuff, there is a large area where bands or DJ's play called the dance hall, there is also a satellite bar in this room, the main bar area has seating for food, further towards the west end there are 2 pool tables, ski-ball, shuffleboard, board games, and 2 small restrooms. 

Smokers, you have to go up the stairs and exit the building to smoke but you do not have to get back in line, you are herded into a little smokers pen, it is a little odd. 

The Rose reading room is behind a gray door in the main bar area (southwest corner of the room) and is a nice respite from the madness in the bar. Sometimes people book the room and sometimes the door is locked, I've been told that this is under the discretion of the security staff. On New Year's Eve a magician performed in this little room, since then I have been very cynical about \"magic\" and I blame this guy for butchering his grand finale trick.

There are shows, chess nights, literary functions and plenty of other events night-to-night."}
{"text":"My number one gripe, WHY are there stools at the bar during peak hours?! Look at any high capacity drinks only bar, at 7/8pm they take all the chairs away so the bar becomes available to stand and order drinks NOT a place to sit. Allowing patrons to sit and muck up the bar creates an absolutely insane line because bar tenders won't serve you. Beyond ridiculous to wait over 30 minutes for a $3 beer because people are seated in front of the bar. 
I have come to valley bar since opening night since I live right up the street. Such a fun and near concept, and since night 1 we could tell that owners/management listen and make adjustment to better the facility. But it's just gotten out of control as of late. It seems to be beyond capacity where you can't walk around let alone find any place to stand because you'll be in the way of every game being played."}
{"text":"It's the best bar in Phoenix I've been to. And I am from Phoenix. Good prices on beer and it's actually underground. Games and a section for musicians. Awesome venue."}
{"text":"Cool place.  It was Monday. We wanted to see a live band. Monday is free game night.  We started off playing a few mean game of ski ball. My wife had a mixed drink it was excellent.  They didn't have a ton of beers on tap. They did have 3 of my favorites so that was a huge plus. Inside had lots of cool vintage decor. Lots of cool Arizona history references. Band was Bronze Radio Return.  They were excellent. It was a great night for a Monday."}
{"text":"The entrance to the bar is in an alley. We stood in line for about 10 mins. WORTH THE WAIT! Once you get inside they have 3 different areas to drink, listen to music, or play games. Last night they had a live Dj. We all were very impressed with the place. Although the bartenders didn't know some of the popular alcohol drinks that are usually made so I will only give 4 stars."}
{"text":"I haven't been out and about in Phoenix in almost 5 years and Valley Bar completely caught me off guard! I never would have expected such a cool spot to exist here. I'm a sucker for speakeasies and hidden bars, and Valley Bar hit every mark I was looking for.

The ambiance was quiet, intimate, but super chill. Everyone was there to have a good time, meet friends, and enjoy the secret basement. No one got super drunk or messy, and it was a really nice night. The drinks were affordable and tasty (according to my friends since I don't drink) but the doughnuts REALLY won me over. I ordered the orange-something and the maple bacon. The maple bacon was literally inhaled by my friend and I, and the orange one a close second.

I also got the fried pickles and my friend got the classic dog. Unique, affordable, foodie eats in a secret location? It doesn't get better than this!

I'll be back before I leave to check out the music section.

I love you, Valley Bar!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have a few drinks.  The story behind the place is interesting, if you go read the story then watch the screen above the bar."}
{"text":"Valley bar oh valley bar. Very very fond memories of what this establishment was. A chill hangout spot for concert goers and foodies. That is until as a of recent (the last four or five months) this location has drifted from its lax roots to entertain and cater to a different crowd. Unnecessary covers of 3-5 dollars,ridiculously long lines whether or not you're there too see the show or get an over iced old fashioned. Bouncers pronouncing 10 is the cut fee.(this isn't LA or Vegas it's downtown ****ing Phoenix) with the separation of short leash kitchen an over hype valley is no longer the rad place in downtown."}
{"text":"Big fan of the atmosphere, staff, and hummus plate! Nice happy hour prices too. Cool decor, pool tables, dart board, in a nice setting. 0 complaints from my time spent here."}
{"text":"I guess valley bar isn't down for a dyke out downtown with her girlfriend. We showed up at about 10pm and prior to that we were at Hanny's down the way. We were both definitely a little a sauced but I don't know what unfortunate event happened at valley bar that they felt they couldn't let in the local gay folk. While my girlfriend was let it without regard I was directed to the side and eventually told \"hey I can't let you in\". Mind you me and my gf have been in numerous times before, even a little sauced  and our favorite drink to get is the Rose Mofford. After visiting Hanny's for a martini we were gunna go to VB for a rose mofford before heading off to Melinda's alley. Turns out even tho we had both the same amount to drink, my hot ass girlfriend was let in with no ease while for some reason my ID was questionable even though I will be 29 years old this year and it is a valid AZ state ID. So after she walked down the steps and realized I was not following her she walked back up and they let her know hey I wasn't being let in. I didn't question it, what am I supposed to do about bouncers that won't let me in to a bar I've been frequenting since it's conception? I don't understand what happened at valley bar to be so hostile towards its gay community but honestly if you're gay don't go here. There are better places to spend your money and better places that are less hostile towards the gay community, like Cornish pasty DT, cobra arcade or Milinda's alley which let me in this night with easy. When did valley bar become so anti-gay????"}
{"text":"Want to have some fun downtown? Want to try something different? Here's what I will tell you. Walk down this dark alley. Find the bouncer standing next to a door leading down in to a basement. Walk down in to the basement. See lights and hear music bumping in front of you. Turn left - see creepy shadows moving above bar. Turn right - see little game room in the back. Yup... I'm hooked and you will be too. 

My 3rd time here the other weekend and I have to admit that I'm a fan. I like to get here a little early to beat the long line to get in (and sometimes cover,) But even then, this place is jammin. That would be my biggest Thumbs down about this place. But I can't hate too much. Good for them. You can't blame people for flocking here. The drinks are cheap and yummy, snacky food is decent, there are plenty of games to play at your table, and a game room in the back. The showroom where you can jam out to fun bands or DJ's. This place has everything."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great drinks, great live music. Big enough that you could find a cozy corner to have a good conversation, too."}
{"text":"I love this speakeasy-eque type bar. The decor is creepy, underground and awesome. I love the arcade games, live music portion and all the bartenders and servers are mega-friendly, knowledgeable and timely in their service. They have a killer $8 old fashion cocktail at happy hour and although a lot of the patrons are hipster/ business people right off work, there's a really enjoyable harmony of different types of people there, which I truly enjoy.It's pretty cool too that you walk down an un-assuming alley, to then arrive at this entrance where if you are lucky, are given the okay to go to the basement .. well not if your lucky.. but it feels that way. If you go before 9 pm, most likely you'll be able to get in.. after that- there will be a little bit of a wait. Protip while you are there- there is no cell phone signal so be ready to tune out the rest of the world :)"}
{"text":"Ah the alley part got me.

Worth the wait to get in, once you're in its all about having a great time. A place to enjoy bands and play in the game room."}
{"text":"What a neat adventure stopping by here. I had heard about this nar that has good live music.

So off I wandered to find this place. I put my GPS and swear that when it said \"you have arrived at your destination\" there was no way that I had arrived. I tried again. And then some sweet stranger asks me what I am looking for. I tell him Valley Bar. Mr.Stranger tells me to go down the alley way turn and go down another alley way. Ummmm are you serious!? Can I trust Mr.Stranger who is telling me to walk down two alley ways...all alone!?

Since it was around 5pm and not too dark. I felt my sens od adventure kick in and wandered down the alley..turn walk down another alley.

No signs of a bar. No neon beer signs beckoning at me. Then I see several people walking up some stairs and out of an open door. There it is a small painted sign. Valley Bar..and a guy wearing a securty shirt..BINGO I found the bar.

I tell myself..Alice go down the rabbit hole and see whats inside.

Down the stairs I go..and I was NOT disappointed.

They had a live music venue. The doors were closed but I could hear the band warming up. I turned left and there is the lounge/bar area. Bar tables, a few couches and the countet bar.

I spy a chair at the counter and belly up. Ordered myself a signature drink. No food was being served as their kitchen is going through an overhaul or something.

Cool lights iluminate the ceiling of the counter bar area. After I down my drinks. I see people walking out of a back area. Curiosity gets the best of me. And I decided to see where the hallway goes.

And I was pleasanrly surprised. It led me by booths of people playing Jenga. To the game room. Billiards, Skee Ball and board games! I knew that I loved this place..and it was worth walking down the alley and down the stairs to find this treasure of a place."}
{"text":"I have been to the valley bar countless times. On multiple of these occasions I have had a fabulous time. Tonight I was at the free concert that Keith urban put on at Margaret Hance park, it was an excellent concert but as usual my fiends wanted to go out afterwords and most of them were at valley bar so we decided to meet up there. As soon as I arrived I realized I didn't have my credit card (chase Freedom) as any concerned citizen would do, I called chase right away to dispute those charges I didn't make and make sure my side of it was clear. As soon as I was off the phone with them I got my wristband into valley bar and got in with no problem. The moment I got downstairs I was immediately told i was too drunk to be inside and they have been watching me. I explained to multiple of their managers what my situation was and that my credit card was stolen and not one of them understood. I was literally dragged out of their bar by 4 bouncers and  told I couldn't look for my friends and boyfriend. I have never ever been treated so terribly by a bar or any establishment at that. I am absolutely appalled by their staff and 20 year old management that didn't take their time to understand that my card was stolen from me at the Concert and has multiple charges on their that weren't even mine. I was trying to be a responsible adult calling about my credit card at a wee hour of the night and this is the treatment I received instead. I will never be going into the valley bar again and they will only be getting terrible reviews from me here on out. 
Thanks for being the worst bar in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fun games, music, and a plethora of drinks. What more could you want on a Friday or Saturday night?! I visited with some coworkers on a Thursday night and this place was definitely hoppin'!!! Tried the fried pickles (a little greasy for my taste, sweet, yet crispy and crunchy), Bear Dog (sounds gross, but it's surprisingly good!), Grilled Cheese Pretzel (my favorite of the night, crispy and ooey-gooey good), and the Loaded Fries (piled high and served with skinny fries). Overall, the food was great and the vibe is so good you'll want to stick around. Subtracted a star because the music was a just a tad too loud. I had to scream to talk to my coworkers. Easier to carry a conversation in the back game room. Games include: skee ball ($1), billiards (just one), pinball, shuffleboard, darts, etc. This place seems to attract the early 20-somethings and a good handful of those in their early 30's. Hidden in an alley near Tom Yum Thai restaurant. If you're facing the Thai restaurant, go down the alley on you right. Cheers!"}
{"text":"New favorite place in Downtown Phoenix tucked away in an alley. My only complaint is that for concerts, they do a bizarre job of partitioning under-21 and 21+ concertgoers with anyone under 21 shoved over to one corner. Sound and acoustics were great during Kris Orlowski's and Ivan & Alyosha's sets.

Other plusses: nice employees AND clean public restroom!!!

There's a parking garage nearby ($7) but I use my ASU parking pass to park in the lot next to Crescent Ballroom, a short walk from Valley Bar."}
{"text":"Just got kicked out because my friend is African American. I went to the bathroom, it smelled of marijuana in the facility. I walk out after I finish my business, a man that works there obviously smells the marijuana and is investigating. Doesn't say a word to me. My friend, who is in fact of African decent and a darker skin color, walks in. He immediately follows him, promptly accuses him of the illegal activity, then proceeds to tell us to leave. I accuse him of racial profiling, he then proclaims \"I am not racist, my niece is half black\" and continues to pester us to leave. A women, very angry, threatens to call the cops on me. Then we leave. I feel this situation needs to be heard, as my friend, an avid church goer and good Samaritan, was wrongly accused and racially profiled. Something needs to be done."}
{"text":"Love this new addition to the downtown neighborhood!  The vibe is so cool and I love the decor.  They have an extensive drink menu and know I will be spending many evenings here listening to great music, enjoying great company and having a few cocktails."}
{"text":"Pretty chill spot. Super unique, and the bartenders are on point. Usually when a bar is this busy, it takes a while to get noticed and get a drink. We were served as soon as we walked up, and the chick bartending was friendly despite how packed this place was.

  There was like one table open, I think it was like a Wednesday or something, around 10 or 11pm. Way crazier than I expected, but I don't frequent downtown often. 

  I almost docked a star for all the board games missing pieces (all unplayable, maybe get Guess Who or something lol), but my inner voice just told me to not be a dick. The only reason we even touched the games was out of drunken stupor, and because all the other games were occupied. 

  We eventually made cool with the people playing shuffleboard next to us, and they gave us dibs for next game. You give collateral for shuffleboard pieces from the bar, so they definitely aren't missing any of those lol.

  I'd go here again someday. They even have Dale's Pale Ale on tap. Score."}
{"text":"I need to go back again to take in the amazing and eclectic decor. 

I need to go back again to try all of their amazing cocktails. 

I need to go back again to see a live show. 

I need to go back again to meet one of the cute gals that hang out there. 

I need to go back again..."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend and her cousin after a dbacks game because I had heard from so many people how cool this place is. The idea of a Arizona themed speakeasy type joint that has pool tables, darts, video games and ski ball all sound awesome to me. The problem lies with the employees and the fact that the patrons are slightly on the douche nozzle side. While walking in through the alley way there was some little goth/indie/emo (whatever you call it) girl hanging upside down from some sort of water pipe or something taking pictures. Then we walked into the place and asked to have next on a pool table and the children said \"you have to play us for the table\". Lol. While sitting around for the next 20 minutes completely ignored by the waitstaff we watched them miss ball after ball. I suck at pool and would have beat them but there's no point to playing pool in a place where we can't even get a drink. Literally everyone on the staff ignored us and nobody ever spoke to us while inside. Had high hopes for this place but after this experience I will never return."}
{"text":"A cool, hipster place. Enter through an alley and descend a flight of stairs to enter, doors to the bar and music area are separate. The bar is homey and cozy with low lighting and plenty of seating. As of now, the super cool patrons span a wide range of ages, but mostly seem like 20-somethings. The drink menu is full of creative cocktails even more creatively named after local politicians. \"The Rose\" Mofford is outstanding. Great assortment of bar games, shuffleboard and the like. Staff and security were polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Such a cool little spot. Our cocktail waitress was great and helped us pick out what cocktails to try. She kept taking care of us as the night got more and more busy. Overall our experience was great; the ambiance, the drinks, the service, etc. So happy to have found a great bar in a different city away from home."}
{"text":"The bartender just now refused to serve my husband and called security because he caught her trying to pour him cheap tequila instead of Don Julio. She called security and refused to serve him. Unbelievable. The music was amazing, but if you will go there, watch out for this scammer behind the bar. Very unhappy and rude lady."}
{"text":"I received TERRIBLE SERVICE WITH TERRIBLE STAFF. I would NEVER return to Valley Bar. They accused the group of people that we were with of discriminating against their staff, after a staff member asked one of us to describe a security guard. They then kicked us out of their entry section and did not allow us to re-enter because of this misunderstanding? It was extremely rude and like I said, I will not be back."}
{"text":"I am really bummed to be writing this because I've always heard really good things about Valley Bar. Finally got the chance to go and celebrate a friends birthday on 12/29/17. The birthday girl was denied access for whatever reason and I was not quite at the door yet so just turned around when the word traveled back through our large group. We split up about an hour later and a few of us decided to go back, got in just fine and thought it seemed like a cool place. We went back to the bouncer working the door that night and tried to talk to him about letting our friend in, find out why she was denied and talk through it like adults. After laughing in our faces the bouncer said she was not welcome and told me specifically that I was \"too old to be there anyways\". Jaw on the floor. I'm 34 - which looks about the age of most other yelper photos provided, I worked in the industry in Chicago and would NEVER treat a potential customer this way - who had hundreds of dollars to spend in celebration - let alone the questionable legal ramifications for being discriminatory.

Sadly, I won't be spreading good news about Valley bar or bringing any visitors here to enjoy \"the scene\" in Phoenix. And let's be real, there are a boatload of tourists I'm sure valley bar depends on to make money.

It's like my parents (who most definitely would be \"too old\" to bring here) always said: I'm not mad, I'm just really disappointed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. It took a minute to find because it's in an alley and it's a little dark- but that's part of the charm, it's very eclectic. Once inside there's a sitting area and a bar, and around the corner there's a sort of game area. We went on free game night which was a blast. The waiter was very attentive and nice but not over the top. I would check it out again on another trip."}
{"text":"First off I hate crowded places.  I have never liked them since I was almost crushed in a soccer riot...no joke.   It took a while to find the place.  My uber driver went around in circles a few times and I was no help because I'm new to the area.  
I went in and was shocked at how crowded and big the place was.   I started looking for a place to order but got side tracked with the fact there are multiple rooms within the place.  I got to the arcade room I think it was called and some one came to take my order.  They started talking about specials and the specials were drinks I didn't know.  I didn't want to sound like a loser so I ordered a crown and coke.  My girlfriend said she saw a review that said there was a library room.  We finished our drinks and set out for it.  A couple drinks later we couldn't find it and decided it was time to move on.  I liked the place it's just a Lil to hipster for me."}
{"text":"Chill vibes, digging the whole \"speak-easy\" vibe. Saw Smino perform on stage, that was cool"}
{"text":"I knew this was my spot when I first walked down the steps into the dark filled room that smelt of incense. I took the left into the bar to see a remarkable round bar with an badass piece of art hanging above it, that I would later learn has an interesting story to go with it. 

The cool dark mysterious vibe has been something i've been looking for in a bar. A place I can go alone and tuck away in a corner with my thoughts, observe people with a delicious drink, and if I so choose play some darts or pool later on. 

If I am feeling social however, I can walk in to the concert hall where I can meet some new friends and dance until my legs are shaky. 

Look for the rose room, a little hidden gem that is the best room in any bar i've ever been to. You'll make new friends in there for sure. 

Go check this place out."}
{"text":"My first impression of the place when my local friend tooked me here was: \"Damn i'm going to get raped or killed by a gang or something\" since the alley is kind of dark. Then we arrived to a random door that serves as entrance to the basement which inspired me a little more confidence (A guy was checking ID's), as you're going downstairs the echoe of the music starts to grow, the first thing you see when you get there is a big gate that leads to a venue (with a stage and a personal bar) where sometimes they have concerts, we didn't know who was playing so we went to the bar area that is located in a contiguous room, as soon as i entered i totally loved the place, lot's of tables with candles on 'em with the bar as background and the dark illumination with the contrast in decorations (fancy furniture next to a neglected wall) gives to the place a totally unique touch, drinks are good with decent prices (i love beer they have good selection), in the back of the place there's an arcade that has slot machines, pool tables, and lots of board games, definitely a most if you're in Phoenix, you'll totally love it."}
{"text":"Tricky to find, but oh so worth it! From the uniquely crafted cocktails to the delicious food, this place kicks mucho ass! There's even a reading room with books and chairs to read books in. Haha! If you like board games, darts, arcade stuff, it's all there too. 
If you're looking for top 40 dance music or basically ANYTHING played on the radio, don't bother coming to Valley Bar. 

Spent Christmas Day here and I must say I've never experienced any show quite like it. 
Firstly, the projector was playing The Simpsons (and other films) behind the djs on stage which created fun and interesting ambience. People were groovin' in front of the stage and it felt like I was at someone's living room dance party, except with much better sound quality! I found a delicious Rioja for $18 a bottle which really can't be beat for going out and the bartenders all have great personalities--so much that the one who served me the wine asked if I wanted a straw for my single serving of wine (bottle). 

If I lived downtown I'd be here every single day to some degree. I guess it's a good thing there's a bit more distance between us.  Cheers Valley Bar! Don't go changin' now!"}
{"text":"They've got interesting drinks and board games, plus- it's underground. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Very trendy spot!  Walking through the alley into the basement is too cool.  Secret rooms, games, and  friendly bartenders.  Only reason I give it four stars is because it does take awhile to get a drink here.  Otherwise it's probably one of the best places to go out during the week and even into the weekend.  They make a mean Old Fashioned!"}
{"text":"We popped into the Valley Bar, while exploring phx celebrating our friends 1 year anniversary from her divorce...

This place was probably the coolest spot we encountered while in downtown phoenix - I mean it's in a basement ... literally underground!  It felt like the kinda spot you may find in a big city like NY or LA.

It was a very chill vibe - there was no cover charge and its a bit hard to find if you don't know where you are going because the entrance is in the back of the building, they had a little game room area (was bummed that the pin ball machine wasn't working though), an area with a DJ spinning tunes and people bustin' moves on the dance floor, then there was a big bar lounges area were we found a table to sit at - we just relaxed and people watched for the most part.  

The music was cool.  The scene was cool ... Alright crowd.  The drinks seemed reasonably priced and seemed to be of quality ingredients - tasted good.

It was so unique and SOOO super cool that I rated it a solid four stars - I've never seen anything quite like this place in a looooong time.  It was fun to just lounge and hang out here ... If I find myself downtown again I would return, but at the same time I won't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"This is a great place, with great drinks and great food.  It is in an ally and a little difficult to find, but just give them a call and they will guide you right in from the street!  They were having some live music the evening that we went to the Chris Cornell show, but we had another show to go to.  I'm working on getting back there this weekend if possible. :)"}
{"text":"The first time I went to this place I was skeptical due to the walk down a dark alley and into the basement. After being there the rest of the night. I loved everything about this place. The positive energy, music and the setting. Not to mention the awesome people that work there. This is now my go-to place!"}
{"text":"Cool place that definitely brings in great music acts. It does freak me out that it is in a basement though. As far as I know there is only one way in and one way out in case of an emergency situation."}
{"text":"You want 'cool' in downtown Phoenix, this is the place to be. Valley Bar has been a local staple since bursting into the scene in 2015, and it's definitely a gem of a bar. Pulling double duty as a popular nightlife spot and music venue adds to the mileage this place can get you. Sometimes you just get bored of places, but I'll never not be down for a trip to Valley Bar.

The first thing that pops out is the entrance to this place. It's in the back alley of the building on the south west corner of Monroe and Central. All there is to draw you in a neon light that reads \"Valley Bar.\" Granted, it's not the most evocative name but it has a lot of low key touches that celebrate the history of Phoenix. Once you descend the stairs, you have a little vestibule that puts the music hall in front of you, and the Rose Room to the left. The latter of the two is one of the coolest bar environments in the county. It has this slightly sinister mobile above the bar casting shadows of things that pay tribute to the arcane history of the city. And the bar is usually well attended, since one usually doesn't have to wait too long to get a drink. They have a limited food menu that features an assortment of appetizers and flatbreads. Definitely worth taking a crack at the hummus plate. And the signature drinks are all named after local politicians. My favorite is the McCain, which is this spicy mezcal drink. It's a little on the pricier side, but they max out at around $10 which is a bit but not too bad compared to other spots. If you have a simpler palette, I recommend Huss's Coffee Kolsch. 

Valley Bar also does a good job of having events. One thing I want to specifically highlight is the monthly Get Lit event in their reading room. It's a small room in the back of the main bar that has a small library, and it's a good size to host a decent crowd of people. Get Lit is a lot of fun because it's an interesting discussion on some of the issues that face writers. It's not strictly for aspiring writers as it may imply, so feel free to check it. It's the first Thursday of every month at 7pm, so get there early and order some Old Fashioned's at happy hour prices.

The music hall is also an enjoyable venue to catch a show in. Most weekends they have a DJ spinning some kind of themed night, which tends to be something like new wave or afrobeat. Often times they have more traditional shows, usually of smaller acts. I've caught a few memorable shows here, specifically a nice dark wave show and the Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra. Prices are reasonable too, and they donate covers they charge for DJ nights to local charities.

So, if you want cool, this is the place to be. Good drinks, good music, and good atmosphere all make this a place to put on your list if you're visiting from out of town or somehow have managed to avoid this place over the last three years."}
{"text":"Hits all the marks for what I look for in a speakeasy-style bar. Back alley basement entrance, sophisticated cocktails, and dimly-lit ambiance. Bartender made me a mezcal/ancho chile cocktail and a cocktail with St. George gin that had a hint of absinthe -- both were well-balanced drinks. I'll be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"All the awesome previous reviews are spot on about this place! Underground atmosphere, with attentive and friendly staff, and nice air conditioning, plus candlelight all throughout, and great music every night!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Stopped in on a Tuesday night after dinner with my husband and was beyond impressed!! Angela the bartender is amazing! Her margaritas are to die for!!!! Chirs is amazing also. Great conversation, great atmosphere... definately a great little find!!!"}
{"text":"They wait till u smoke a cigarette and then they don't let you back in because they say your too drunk...I don't even smoke but they always kick out my friends and they are not even drunk at all...I proceeded to complain to my friends about them kicking my friend out who didn't deserve it and they kicked me out just for badmouthing their over zealous staff... I'm tired of this place serving alcohol and then kicking you out as soon as you show any signs of enjoying a buzz..."}
{"text":"I visited this place on a Monday night because it was the one day out of the week I was free visiting dt Phoenix AZ. 

I came to this place because of the Yelp reviews and again, because it was a Monday night, my expectations weren't really high. 

I ordered the rose moddoff (I think) and it was verrrrry good. Def. recommend. What sucked was that they stop serving food at midnight even though they close at 2am. Because I was visiting from CA and love books, I wanted to check out the secret library. The bartender, who was really nice, told me it was open and to just pull on the door a bit because it's jammed. I tried several times and it felt locked. I told the bartender that it was locked and he told me to ask the security guard to open it. No biggie, sure! With a douche smile he says no one can go in there past midnight... THEN WHY ARE YOU OPEN UNTIL 2? I had already gotten weird vibes from him when I walked in and this just definitely confirmed it. It's not like the place was busy. Wouldn't have killed him to open the door and let me see it for 10 minutes. 

I was excited that there were board games to play with, but several had missing pieces. 

I would come back because I really liked their drinks on a busier day to get a full sense of the scene and check out their live music."}
{"text":"Cool stop but had the worse service there ever. Security and servers had no costumer Service... Very disappointing..."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, craft cocktails, old school arcade games, board games, pool tables. $3 cover when I went on a Friday night"}
{"text":"Valley bar is overrated and their staff is unprofessional. I've been here a few times and have never had a good experience  I especially didn't like the way Jay, their doorman, spoke to my girlfriend this weekend. She is not from the United States and he said some discriminatory and rude comments to her as we walked up to the bar. After hearing his comments we decided to leave"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite bar in Phoenix.  It has a great speakeasy vibe to it, the drinks aren't outrageously priced, they have fantastic live music and they have a game area.  The atmosphere is great and the people there are fantastic.  You need to go check it out.  I guarantee you'll have a great time without spending a fortune!"}
{"text":"Shit was dope. Underground. Live music. Back alley. Darts & pool. Some dude smashed a picture of a confederate general- shit got real. I give 4/5 cuz no one seemed to have info about the tickets they were selling for the \"live show\" - girl selling tickets didn't know what the fuck it was for I was curious but was given no answer? Was it a strip tease? Fuck, who knows... they didn't... but dope bar!!!"}
{"text":"The night started celebrating friends having their first born, which lead to the basement of Valley Bar, which quickly turned into my worst night out in Phoenix.  While watching the dance floor, I was slammed by a walk in cooler door, which by the way should have a window if opening onto a public space, like a dance floor.  I am quite sure this is a code violation.  Who has a walk-in cooler door swing into a dance floor with no window?  Rhetorical question of coarse.  I forgave this since I was new to the bar.  However, I was not expecting then to be assaulted by the person exiting the walk-in cooler.  The guy came out of the cooler and pushed me from the back very hard and screaming move.  We stepped forward accommodating his his request and assault.  Not knowing how far to move, I apologized to him stating \" sorry I have never been to this bar before this area was not marked to not as a not to stand-in area.  The entire time the staff member was overly aggressive trying to start  a fight.  Yelling \"Come on Say Something\" and \"Do you want to take this outside.\"   It was like being in Roadhouse before Patrick cleaned up the hellhole.  What made it even worse was he then proceeded to taut a fight as we went back to our table of friends that we came with us that night.  This guy literally walked behind us yelling, asking for us to fight him.  We did not even acknowledge him as we went to the table.  The entire time yelling \"What did you say\" and \"Com'on  lets take it outside.\"  When we got to the table he aggressive charged and started yelling again.  It was surreal.  First being treated that way and second he was was a little 5'3\" A-hole. But being raised properly, I erred on a more consecutive path, not to hit the trash talking employee. And he then throws my partner out after he gets in his face and starts screaming again.  Wow.......I have 4 witness to attest to the fact of this staff member was trying to start a fight.  We were not even engaging this person, just trying to have a good time.  So my only explanation for this incident is the fact we were a gay couple in this bar.  My partner was removed from the bar, and all five remaining left the bar.   After a horrible round with the inept manager, we left.  What a horrible joke of a place.  We should have filed assault charges against him."}
{"text":"So I kinda love Valley Bar.

It's this funky, underground bar that's a weird mishmash of differing ideas about what it wants to be and it somehow works. 

You have the bar/restaurant area that would be a tiny bar in its own right.

The service is actually pretty good, I've only ordered food once or twice but it hasn't disappointed. 

Then you have the small game area adorned with pool and random arcade games. Perfect place to lounge or take a date if the conversation stalls. 

And then the stage area. If you enjoy getting your hearing tested, but having a front-row seat for whatever small music act they've booked, you've found the right place. They even have another convenient bar located right there.

Overall, a great place to spend the night for a number of different interests."}
{"text":"I was no question racially profiled at  this bar. There were several people before us that entered the bar no problem.
As soon as my life partner and I entered the security line we were singled out right away. I am so disappointed as we've heard such good things. I guess valley bar discriminates against minority's. I will never return here."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent drinks and excellent service. Very cool Speak Easy in downtown Phoenix. You enter down a dirty alley to a non-descript door. You then go a flight of stairs into a 30's feel speak easy. This place is definitely worth a visit if you are in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Loved loved this bar!! It gives you a different vibe than your average bar in Phoenix. They have really artsy decorations and the energy there was awesome! The drinks are very reasonably priced and they also had food, but I'll try that next time. 
The staff was beyond awesome! Usually you go to a bar and have to fight to get a drink, but not here they were very attentive and even after we found an area to sit at. There was a waitress that came up to us right away and grabbed us more drinks and gave us suggestions depending on our tastes. I will for sure be coming back here and highly recommend anyone that is from Phoenix or comes down to visit to make a stop here."}
{"text":"Def. a fun experience for downtown. Great bands."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm a Phoenix native and maybe a bit of an enthusiast. I love the mobiles above the bar, all things AZ. Such a fantastic idea. The secret room made me feel like I was stepping back in time. Our waiter, Angel was amazing. My favorite cocktail was the Rose Mofford. Light and floral. Very feminine. I went here to see a show, the venue is a bit narrow, but it was a nice intimate experience. I really appreciate the speakeasy vibe and the fact that it's in the basement. Must check this place out, if you can find it ;)"}
{"text":"always so fun, especially friday nights! the bartenders always provide solid, quick servi e"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a client friend to listen to a performance by my drummer dude pal Joe Costello of the The Joe Costello Syndicate.   If you want to listen to some great jazz sounds, do a Google for him, and he's always on the calendar either for a public or private event.   He is very personable -- making an effort to stop by and say \"HI!\" -- and is very talented.  He puts together some great groups.

Joe had advertised that he was performing there May 10, and the group was spotlighting the music of Chet Baker and Gerry Mulligan.  Okay.   I don't know whether I should admit this or not, but I had never heard of them.  I told my client friend about it, and he jumped at the opportunity of listening to the group.   In fact, he told me hehas a ton of Chet and Gerry's CDs.   Okay.   I guess I better get with it. ...

We went.   In order to get into the Valley Bar, one has to walk up an alley.   UGHHHH!   Smelled. ... VB is set up in two parts:   the room where the group was performing as well as the other side where a bunch of the younger crowd (20 somethings) were hanging.   I was not impressed with the red wine I got.   I don't know if there is more than one red wine, but the one I received was almost undrinkable.   The acoustics were good as well as the venue.   There was plenty of seating whether tables set up in front of the stage and could be reserved, or hightops in the back or folding chairs in between.

I would definitely go again, making sure I hold my nose when I walk in the alley. ..."}
{"text":"Part of me is kicking myself for spreading the word about this awesome place. I don't want too many people to find out about it and overrun it. That said, it's places like Valley Bar that make me proud to live in Phoenix. So much has changed since I moved here over 8 years ago and downtown is FINALLY starting to feel like a real downtown. Valley Bar adds legitimacy to my last statement because reminds you of something you'd find in L.A. or maybe New York. And did I mention that it is a performance space AND a basement bar? I LOVE basement bars and I'm SO happy we have one downtown.

Though this is run by the same folks who run Crescent Ballroom, the vibe is TOTALLY different and it is exactly my kind of vibe. You walk down an unassuming alley off Monroe, next to US BANK (I assured my female co-workers that I was not taking them to be raped and murdered) and through the door beneath the equally unassuming red neon \"Valley Bar\" sign. Down the stairs you go. If you're taking in a show, you go straight. If you're needing bevies, hang a left to the bar.

The bar is VERY cool with dim lighting and good music playing. They also have a game room with shuffle board, see ball, poll and darts. I'm pretty impressed with their hand-crafted cocktails, all named after Arizona politicians. Though I don't like cinnamon, I found \"The Ducey\" to be balance and not too sweet. They also have a good selection of beer and wine. 

Though they've only been open a few weeks, the place NEVER feels jam packed, even on a Friday when they have a decent crowd. I sincerely hope that that does not change, because that is part of what makes this place awesome. The servers are all really friendly and enthusiastic. Some of them already know me and my drink(s) of choice, which is a really nice touch.

I reluctantly (for my own selfish reasons) HIGHLY recommend that everyone check this place out. This is one of those places that is going to help put downtown Phoenix on the map!"}
{"text":"the ambience here is a little weird like a repurposed basement storage which is fine. the food is ok, however I really don't appreciate how rude my bartender was! I will never return because of that bartender. Go across the street to Melinda's alley you will have a better time"}
{"text":"Went bar hopping while in Phoenix. Used Yelp to find some tasty drinks. We spent time at an Irish pub but was told about The Valley. OK, first of all, if you have been drinking, don't even try to find this place.  It's actually down an alleyway.  No signs to speak of other then a  burley guy standing near a dark door.  Unsettling to say the least. We walked past the mouth of the alley 3x before we asked some guy walking by. He laughed and told us to follow him. He turned into an alley and I began looking 360 waiting to be jumped and robbed.  We ended at the door and burley guy.   We entered and went downstairs. We were instantly blown away. What an amazing, cool bar.  Booths to sit at, tables and bar. The decor was pretty cool.  A hodgepodge of deco art. Whoever put this place together tustve been a cool cat.

We sat and order some old fashions. Awesome. Killey? The bartender was cool and we ordered a brussel sprout, egg pizza and an Italian sandwich. Both were awesome.  We spent most of the night there and everyone was super chill. Whenever I return to Phoenix, this will definitely be on my short list to go."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving three stars is because my bartender was really nice and they seemed to offer a lot of games/ entertainment. 

However, the bar was completely over packed and gave off a serious uber-hipster vibe which one would typically find in NYC or LA. Not my kind of crowd.

I guess for Phoenix the concept may be considered unique/cool (?) but I didn't find it very special.. I had a much better time with a friendlier crowd at the Irish pub down the street."}
{"text":"I gues its ok , no dress code, vintage decor. This place is hidden underground. if u want to hide from ur peeps this is the place . Wear  whatever dont dress up or they will look at u crazy lol."}
{"text":"I really, really, really wanted to hate this place. I tried, too! But just shut up, okay? I know that arcade bars and jenga are a little overplayed right now, but people who genuinely complain just hate fun or suck at pinball or something.

Valley Bar is great. They've got a great diversity of drinks, so you can play on the cheap or class it up with a boozeable named after your favorite Arizona politician. (The McCain is made with Mezcal and a must-try for Scotch people.) My only complaint would be that the distribution of drinks doesn't always match the needs of the customer, which is my way of saying I have had to navigate a very choked floorplan with something only slightly sturdier than crystal stemware holding $9 worth of delicious.

NONE OF THIS MATTERS! Valley Bar could be a guy dolling PBR tallboys out of an igloo in the bed of his pickup truck in a much shittier alley, and I would still show up if the house band was there. Over and out."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite bar in the Phoenix area since my first visit to it. Its a place that takes effort to find but immediately pays off. It is a great place to take a date or anyone visiting from out of town. Every time I go there I either reconnect with someone or make new friends. The vibe there is great for meeting new people or entertaining your group."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Phoenix bar scene! Cool atmosphere with a very eclectic vibe.

Drinks are very good! I had the Stanton...delish!!!

Bartenders are very friendly as well :)"}
{"text":"Went to Valley Bar last weekend to catch a friend of a friend's band play.  The venue was hard to find - you have to walk down an alley to find the door in the back.  The bands were playing in the basement - not the most acoustically friendly of spaces.  The cover band as well as the band we came to see were pretty good - I wouldn't be likely to buy their music to play at home, but I was entertained for the night.  The selection of beer (including local) was pretty good.  The sound quality wasn't the best - it was a bit echoey in the room as well as LOUD!"}
{"text":"In the alley down some dark lit stairs is one of the coolest spots in the valley to get a drink. 

The drinks, a little bit of a play on Arizona's Political history are pretty classy.

I went with the \"The Rose\" Mofford which has Tito's vodka, Tempus Fugit Violette, Lemon Juice, Rose water & Simple syrup. This is a classy cocktail, makes you feel like a classy dame for drinking it. 

Valley Bar has rooms within rooms, if you make it in to the reading room, check out some of the books, they are a wide variety and interesting finds. They have live music too.

The only downside, the ladies restroom, only one sink was working, and the 1st stall is in clear site of those who are outside of the restroom when the door opens. And the last step when coming down the stairs is a killer!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Not bad at all.  Was hoping one day that Monroe's would come back.  This'll do... but not the same.  Not trying to be, which is good... but it's just not intimate.  I miss that kind of feeling.  Been here twice and I'd go back again.  Nice to have another choice here downtown."}
{"text":"While it was very crowded it was a fun place to hang for my birthday.  I felt a little short-changed on my drink.  Wasn't as strong and the glass not completely full."}
{"text":"Valley Bar. I love the flicker of light, the drinks to match and the music- with exception to the 80's jams which weren't even hot in the 80's (it only happened once, maybe I missed the memo.) I really enjoy the drinks, the silhouette vibe and incense smell. I went there to spend time with people I love and that was accomplished. I did ask for WiFi, I saw the ValleyBar signal but was told it's not public: heart sunk. If you want loyalty from your customers, share the love. The delivery in that message was also unaccommodating. We give, you should give too."}
{"text":"Fun trendy intimate lounge/bar with games and good drinks. 

Initially, this place could be difficult to locate.  To get to the entrance, one has to walk around to the alley behind a deli.  There is a sign, but it's not incredibly prominent. 

Walk down the stairs and enter coolness! There's a very small venue for musical acts in one section, and a bar/gameroom in the other section. The music venue also has a bar but wasn't serving snacks when  I was there. 

The venue is perfect size for smaller acts, like Trails and Ways, MRCH, etc.  The only complaint about the venue for music acts; it was ice cold! I was freezing the entire time the band was playing. There are some stools/chairs and tables in the music section but not enough for everyone. 

The game room/bar section is funky and cool with some games.  I was told that Monday nights would include free games, but this was not true.  There are board games, cards, Jenga, etc. for tables to grab.  There were little bags of snacks at each booth/table, including pretzels, popcorn, etc. 

The drinks are interesting and priced similarly to other bars of this nature.  

The service was OK but nothing special."}
{"text":"Insanely awesome decor and aesthetic. Awesome and friendly staff. Not to mention their security is top notch. I had a great time here with friends, playing board games, pool, and enjoying modestly priced cocktails. Good music too. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm writing a five star review, not that I think these guys care what anyone thinks. 
First you have to hold your breath and watch your step as you skip over the puddles of piss as you travel down a dumpster infested alley. Of all the bars I've been to downtown, this is the coolest. The bartenders are flying, the drinks are fast and well priced, the crowds of people are some of the best Phoenix has to offer. I couldn't take my eyes off of the shadow box designed bar."}
{"text":"I like how this bar has a speakeasy vibe with the back-ally entrance and craft cocktail menu. The Arizona history theme is very amusing as well. Happy hour prices were very reasonable and the service was great. I didn't try the food, but it seems like a solid place to grab a drink."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  It's okay during the week.  I made the mistake of going here on a Saturday....I will not make that mistake again.  The place turns into an absolute shi*show.  It's like a cross between a cheap nightclub in Palm Springs mixed with broke college kids.  Drinks spilled all over the floor, filthy, bathrooms out of Mexico with toilets overflowing.  Mixed with the non attractive crowd filled way over what it / should be legal as far as a basement capacity this place is not safe to go to. It's seriously a death trap.  we had such a poor experience I will never go back again on any night."}
{"text":"I'm admittedly a little mehhhh when it comes to Phoenix in general, but this bar is great. Feels kinda underground (I guess it is) and has a great drink/food menu, Skee ball (I think this is all you need to know), and chill vibe. Niice."}
{"text":"Great alley bar in downtown Phoenix with a great environment, and chill atmosphere to enjoy a craft cocktail or beer. Across the street fronSeamus McCaffrey's in the alley. I highly recommend you check it out. It is one of the few places open late during the week. First drink I tried was the Honey Badger."}
{"text":"The alley leading to the bar is only the beginning of what makes this place special.  Great basement bar!  Drink list is extensive.  Crowd is mixed and of all ages.  It's a good social setting."}
{"text":"Cheap cover fee! It was my first time going there and had so much hype around this place that I expected the cover to be $10-$15 but it was ONLY $3 and the best part was that it all went to support the local LGBTQ charity One in Ten. I'm not going to lie, I was a bit disappointed because I heard that Friday nights was Latin night and my friend and I went ready to dance only to be greeted by a variety of hipster music. I know hipster music is no way to describe music but I don't even know how to describe genre they were playing. 

It was not bad, it created a cool vibe which is why my friend and I decided to stay for a drink. Service was great, our server was super friendly and warned my friend and I about the flavors or the drinks we ordered. My friend and I decided to order them anyways and we loved them. I had a chili infused cocktail that I believed was called 99 to Fife and I loved it! The quality of the drink was felt because everything was fresh. I could taste the tequila, the chili simple syrup, and the fresh limes in every sip.

This is definitely a place to come to with a group of friends, the have pool tables, games, a beautiful bar area, food options and definitely something everyone can enjoy. I will definitely be returning because now I know what to expect."}
{"text":"I went to an around the world wine tasting in this hidden gem of a bar.  The bar was a little hard to find but had the feel of a speak easy as soon as I was able to locate it.  The bar is located down a long stair case but as soon as you step into the bar the ambiance feels like you've stepped into a 1920's cocktail room.  The wine. was hidden in paper bags and the guests had the fun of guessing which wine was what. The hostess who ran the wine tasting was very informative and felt more like you were kicking back with your best fired than a hired employee running a wine tasting.  I highly recommend the wine tasting at this location."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, with nods to historic AZ countrymen and women. The entrance is in the alley!"}
{"text":"VALLEY BAR IS MY FAVORITE OF ALL TIME.

Honestly. I would come to this bar every single night, despite the fact that I live 30 minutes away. 

This bar has such a cute, hip, almost speakeasy kind of ambiance. There are games and billiards. The seating areas are cute and give it such an old-timey kind of feel. 

The house drinks are good, pricey, but worth it. The bartenders are down to make any drink you throw at them. The food menu is short, but sweet. 

I know this is weird to comment on (but it matters to me): the rest rooms are always clean and it's not like other bars where you catch drunk-out-of-their-mind chicks puking all over. 

Valley Bar is classy. Easily one of the best bars located downtown.
The most annoying thing about valley bar is also one of the most awesome parts about it, and that's the fact that it is literally hidden in an alley between sky scrapers in DTPHX. 

Yes. Speakeasy bars for the win."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. I almost kissed my friend who brought me here! It's by far the best bar/venue I've ever been to in Arizona. Situated in a Basement, you'd never know this place existed. It literally feels like you're in another world upon entering. You can almost feel the good times to come. Literally. 

The drink prices are probably the best in the area. The bartenders and servers are so amazing and friendly, it's like coming home!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went out for a birthday celebration and we stumbled on this bar.  The atmosphere was really cool, the music playing was refreshing and the beer selection was very good. We drank, laughed and played darts. All in all, it was a good night. We were very excited that we found this place. We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Of my 6 months in Arizona, I think I've made the 30-40 min drive to Valley Bar at least 5x, and I can assure you there will be many more times in the next 3.5+ years. 

Valley Bar is without a doubt one of my fav places for a drink (and a show and appetizers and games) in Phoenix. This hidden speakeasy type bar has such a cool vibe and is so eclectic that each time is a whole new experience. 

Whether you've come from First Friday at the museum, the symphony, dinner, a show (currently I'm at a Latin jazz tribute to Jobim and Tito Puente), or just because you're in the area - Valley Bar is a place you can count on for a great cocktail/beer/glass of wine, delicious appetizers, and a very laid back night!

If you enjoy a good adventure, you really can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Don't wear color or smile at the doorman, you might not get in. The bouncer has a power complex. A group of professional, attractive women just got rejected at the door for zero reason. (Read: not remotely drunk/ not wearing black/ too happy)"}
{"text":"A little challenging to find but very cool once you do find it. Love the atmosphere, attentive servers. Corey was awesome."}
{"text":"Valley bar is a cool little basement bar/venue.
We came here Friday night for a show to see The Spill Canvas. The only issue i would say is the staff here needs to chill and not be such dicks with the attitude. Like the guy kept looking at my ID and me dude it's me. Idk if they have issues with under age kids but Chill out please. 
As for the venue is small. Best part the AC works wonders no smelling sweaty people bumping into u.
I like that they had bar stools all over the venue to sit which was great for me being that I'm 32 weeks pregnant and standing for a long time kinda sucks.( no judgement that I'm still going to concerts being pregnant) haha
Omg my husband and I would so come back to this venue tho if any other bands we like ever play here."}
{"text":"This place is a bit difficult to find but it's absolutely worth asking around. I felt like I stepped into a Speakeasy. Attentive bartenders, nice clientele. Good cocktail menu. On St. Patrick's Day it was busy, but not too busy. Of course I'm not one to stay up too late so I probably was out of there long before the real crowds got there."}
{"text":"We were told about this place by a bartender at a nearby place and would have walked past it if we hadn't asked a \"loitering stranger\" in the alley if he knew where The Valley Bar was... He simply opened the nondescript door for us. 

It has a fun, mysterious, illicit vibe. I had an old fashion and it was good. Bartender was friendly and checked on us enough to make sure we didn't run dry. 

Met a couple fellow patrons at the bar and had fun conversations.

A fun place for something out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Valley bar is my go-to place downtown. The first time I went, I couldn't find it, but we asked the nice security guard at the front desk of the fancy glass building right next to it, and he was able to point it out for us. It's located down a flight of stairs, although I did hear the bouncer tell this guy who had crutches that there was an elevator down somewhere.

This place just has great vibes all around. Above the bar, there's like a slowly rotating fan that has little statues/trinkets hanging off of it that are then blown up into shadow form onto this canvas-like thing... it's hard to describe and I didn't take a picture, but it's mesmerizing. The service is nice, the drinks are reasonably priced, and the food pretends to be fancy, but the fries were the best thing off the menu. 

I've come here the most for Seinfeld Trivia. For the longest time, they weren't updating their Facebook event, but they always have it on their website, or if you call them, they'll let you know when to show up. The place always gets packed on Seinfeld nights, but the crowd is super fun, and there are awesome prizes if you win (Junior mints, anyone?)

Parking can be a bit tough; you will likely have to find street parking and walk a few blocks, or use a rideshare app like Lyft or Uber."}
{"text":"Went there to see Moonchild with my son. The entrance is in an alley off of Monroe & Central. The bar is in the basement of the building. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The concert room is a little cramped and for standing only, but the acoustics are excellent."}
{"text":"Valley Bar is by far my favorite place to go in Downtown Phoenix at night. It gets busy on the weekends, so I usually end up there during the week. The prices are fair and the atmosphere is great, it's not a typical rowdy bar; it's different. The vibe inside is pretty laid back and it is a good place to check out local acts. I will choose Valley Bar over anywhere else nearby. If you are in town, this is a place you must check out."}
{"text":"Finally made it here after hearing about the place for some time. I was pretty let down by my experience, but would not be opposed to going again because of the cool concept.

My drink that I ordered was good, but the service was seriously lacking. We also ordered the tiramisu which was interesting - wouldn't say that it was my favorite."}
{"text":"I love this place great food selection great beer and cocktails are phenomenal good ambience good music love the Decour, the games, The waitresses are very knowledgeable and patient.

Do you want to find a place in Phoenix 20 wind and have a good time check this place I guarantee you gonna like it."}
{"text":"The perfect underground bar. Friendly and efficient staff, awesome menu (drink and food) and the venue is beast. Where else can you play darts, skeeball and pool at the same spot?"}
{"text":"The whole time I was there I felt like: this is the kind of place you go if you're trying to hide from people or where you would take a side boo. I would have never found it on my own. Went there cuz a buddy had a gig and a group of us went to show support. We'd walked around the block when we found other friends who knew where it was. The entrance is at the ball of a fairly dark alley,  with neon lights over the door.  It is in the basement of the building and was just super dark. If not for the group I was with and the buddy we went to support, I would have left within 5 mins of being there. It just gave me an uneasy feel and I was happy when I made it through that alley safely on our way out."}
{"text":"So there are a million and a half reasons to love this place. But legit, Stephanie just put a wristband on me so straight. No hair is getting caught on this!!!"}
{"text":"With a group of people, and one decided we should go check out valley bar, as it is an experience. We all drove there and stood in line. 

The only experience I got was the fact that it was kind of in an alleyway and the excitement that it is this hidden secret. 

We stood in line for about 20 minutes, finally half of our group goes in and some waits until the security guy finally lets us in. 

Bar looked neat, it was packed, and whatever and was playing last night was very good. 

Behind the bar, there were seats and a games area where people can actually sit and play board games and order food, In addition to other games such as darts across from the seating area. 

Finally the drinks, my order is not complicated, so I got my usual vodka soda, they did have ciroc vodka which is my go to vodka, and it was well made, but nothing special. One  turn off for me was the fact drinks were served in plastic solo cups.  Not sure if I would go back to it soon, but if my friends wanted to check it out again, I'd join them."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour to meet up with some friends. It's 110 out here in Phoenix so everyone has hydro flasks for water. As I came to the bouncer at 5:30 I was turned away because of my water bottle. I had to take another lyft home to drop off the water bottle. The \"security\" obviously gave me a complete lie. 20 minutes later 5 underaged looking ASU students came in all with water bottles and backpacks. This place is so inconsistent with its security team I'm not sure they have brain cells to rub together. 

The place is dirty and the dumpiest. Literally you walk through a sketchy homeless back alley way with 4-6 stinky garbage crates to get to the bar. It's like an underground gambling house where security slides open the mail slot to make sure you are of age. Makes me feel like I should pack heat because I don't feel safe. 

Security here is a joke so make sure you don't look at them in the eye wrong. The guy with the beard should be fired immediately for his rudeness."}
{"text":"Let's play a game. It is called, \"that sounds awful ... But it's awesome!\"  

1 - let's go to this downtown Phoenix bar I know. It is down an alley, behind some dumpsters, through an unmarked door attended by a seated bouncer (yeah, the guy just sits by the door down an alley and behind some dumpsters), and down into the half finished basement of some 40's era building.
 
\"That sounds awful ... But it's awesome!\"

(Truthfully, the basement only looks half finished. The bar is dark and has the low ceiling you'd expect of a 40 's era building basement but the bathroom is clean, modern, and well lit, exposing the charade). 

2 - I know! Let's have drinks named after Arizona illuminati together with a spicy dog on flat bread dressed with barbecue sauce, crumbled bacon, Gouda cheese, cracker jacks, and peanut butter.

\"That sounds awful ... But it's awesome!\"

(Truthfully, the mixed drinks are awesome. I recommend the Stanton though the (Rose) Mofford was also very good. That dog? That was the truth already. It is a Short Leash creation served up by Short Leash Kitchen up above ground. Don't think about it, just order it. It is so much better than you'd expect and pairs well with a bitter Stanton (OK, a negroni made with rye)). 

3 - I know, I know, let's hang here longer and check out the live music in the small live music room that is mostly just standing room but books awesome acts. 

\"That sounds awful ... But it's awesome!\"

(Truthfully... Yeah. That was pretty much it above. But really you are way too cool to watch an awesome act (David Ramirez) sitting down, right? Damn the crowds, there is too much awesome here not to enjoy. No, really, stifle the \"hey kids, get off my lawn\" deep inside and hipster up. This is an awesome live music venue). 

Take it from this old man, The Valley Bar is both super cool and awesome."}
{"text":"This my go-to weekend bar in Phoenix. If I am downtown, I will no doubt end up here. Big space, underground, music venue, games, and Arizona politician-inspired cocktails.  I have always had good service, too.

I also recommend following them on instagram to find out what's going on on any given night."}
{"text":"We tried finding this place. Don't know if the address is not accurate but it kept taking us to Subway. Really wanted to try it out cause they had live music . Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I went to Valley Bar last night for the first time to meet a few friends. I really dig the ambiance, you walk under a small flickering neon sign down a long flight of stairs to a dimly lit basement broken into multiple areas.

However, I only give this place three stars because of my encounter with the bartender. I was sober and it was a crowded Saturday night. After 15-20 minutes a space cleared at the bar and I made eye contact with the bartender. However, instead of serving me she turned her attention to two ladies who had just approached maybe 2 minutes earlier.

Honest mistake? Probably, but when I politely asked to be served first she snapped at me and motioned to the security guard nearby. That was a huge overreaction and left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"OMG I AM OBSESSED WITH ROSE MOFFORD COCKTAIL!  By far this bar has been so good to me and the specialty drinks are so good and so different. The vibe is more on the hipster side of life but the drinks are right up my alley! I have been here on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays and I have never been disappointed. If you are in DTPHX check out valley bar !"}
{"text":"Talk about a secret hiding place!  This bar is in an alley! Now if that doesn't intrigue you, then this isn't for you. We paid a $3 cover since there was a band/music playing and when we got inside and it was PACKED. Since it was our first time here we just walked around and explored. This place has so many nooks and crannies that we didn't even know where to begin! It reminded me of a speakeasy for hipsters. 

We were quite surprised when a random dude asked us if we wanted anything to drink. Apparently they have random servers walking around. So we ordered and gave our money to this guy and within 2-3 minutes he comes back with change and our drinks. I got a drink that was recommended by the server, something that starts with \"Rose\" (it was too loud to hear clearly). It had a rosemary herb inside and smelled enticing. We saw people going in a random door so we stepped in to find a LIBRARY. Yes, a library. In a bar. This room was like a secret room of solitude but with like 30 people inside. It was the coolest! I would definitely come back to try to find more secret rooms. 

If you don't like crowded, loud noise, or hipsters, don't come here. But for an interesting new experience, you will definitely be overwhelmed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were ALMOST not cool enough to hang out at the Valley Bar. Luckily, it was a Tuesday and they weren't super busy, so they probably just appreciated the business and ignored the fact that neither of us were wearing Warby Parker glasses or hand-carved rosewood plugs in our ears, and my husband's pants weren't cutting off circulation to vital areas. 

So the night before, we asked for a recommendation for a cool spot from our bartender/server at Squid Ink, and she told us about this little place in an alleyway that ended up being right across from the Hotel San Carlos, where we were staying in downtown Phoenix. It's like, behind the Subway's dumpsters. 

We were one of maybe four people in the Rose Room lounge when we got there around 5:00, but things started to pick up later in the evening. It's super dark in there, with funky garage sale paintings on the walls and this really interesting permanent art display; it's a bunch of random silhouettes cut from tin (I think) strung onto rotating mobiles. Their shadows are projected onto canvas by some tiny spotlights. There's trains and coyotes and a leg and it turns out that they're all there to tell a story about some lady who bumped off her friends at the turn of the century. As someone who generally finds modern art to be annoying and pretentious, this was actually really cool.

My husband and I ordered food and drinks off of the happy hour menu, a real treat for us because in Indiana, happy hour is illegal. We had the bacon wrapped dates and the spinach bread (or something), along with some strong but tasty cocktails mixed up by Jenny, who was a fantastic bartender and really fun to talk to. 

We walked out of there around 9:00 happy that our server from Squid Ink had pointed us in such a fun, laid-back direction. We will DEFINITELY be back when we're in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"They told us we couldn't get in bc we were intoxicated... I respect bouncers and bartenders but this was out of line. He denied everyone that was in line since 1:05am. I had a glass of wine and he asked what we did tonight and I told him we went to a wedding so we are celebrating... it was st Patrick's Day so I get it. But I wasn't drunk not even close. Too happy? Ok I just witnessed two people getting married!?!?! Yes I'm happy. 

Whatever we went to another bar without making a scene. Bartender was amazing. He was surprised this guy didn't let us in. Won't recommend or come here ever."}
{"text":"Unbelievably cool. 
Part music venue, part bar and just an amazing place to hang."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for the first time in December.

Cool atmosphere but we all got food poisoning from the sausage flatbread pizza....that wasn't fun.

Be careful..stick to the drinks!"}
{"text":"Just the kind of place I was looking for!! A hidden oasis. Great staff great atmosphere! What we need in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"The place was half empty and it took forever to get service and when we finally did they never came back. The atmosphere was fun but service was horrible."}
{"text":"First they ditched the neon sign. It's a bit hard to find now. But once you to find it the first thing you experience is the smell of delicious garlic bread coming from up the stairs. My mouth was watering before I head down. The drinks were amazing, the waitress was super nice. The flatbreads were tasty and smelt unbelievable. I could see myself spending a lot of time here."}
{"text":"Been to the Valley Bar many times to watch shows, throw darts, and play pool.
Turned away tonight because we had our own darts.
Disappointed. Not going back -"}
{"text":"This is the bar that is going to set the bar for all other bars in Phoenix! Valley Bar is exactly what downtown needed. It is without a doubt the coolest, most versatile space in the area, consisting of an intimate music venue on one side, and a surprisingly large bar area complete with a game room on the other side. Skee ball, darts, pool, shuffleboard, and old school arcade games occupy the game room, while the rest of the bar area is lined with tables booths and comfy couches. The unique cocktail list is cleverly made up of drinks named after Arizona politicians (although I was surprised to find that Goldwater and Arpaio were left off the list). The fully stocked bar also offers draft and canned beer, and draft wine. The location is a bit tricky to find, but there is no doubt that this place won't be kept secret for long!"}
{"text":"Read some reviews, saw some pics, seemed p lit tbh. I'm from LA, sliding thru 4 a few days for work. Had some trouble finding the spot, but that made it more intriguing. We were mobbin pretty deep, diverse squad tho --different ages, different races. N e way, get to the door & the bartender looks at my homie and is like \"u can't bring in that camera.\" I thought he was messing w us at first, but then he gets all serious n shit, & is like: \"nah u really can't bring that in.\" He said we were allowed to take as many pics on our phones, but not on his camera. Being as this was a hipster looking joint, I figured he would know the difference between an old film camera & some high tech ting. My boy's camera was a damn near antique, couldn't take any pictures, but the iPhone was allowed? The 12 megapixel iPhone ?? Come on dog. He was trippin. We had a big friendly group n we all had to take that L cuz we weren't about to leave our mans outside with his old Nikon. Fuck this joint. Zero stars."}
{"text":"There was a super gr8 live band \"The Darts\". I'm a fan now.

An expansive basement club that was actually temp cool and had chill patrons. The bathroom of course is 4 stalls, as most clubs are, but the line was moving.

The following DJ played the safe alternative 80's music with his pal jumping around on the stage. 

About 10 beer taps and an array of alcohols. Bartenders okay.

Liked how it was tucked away in a back alley. Gotta walk down stairs. Beware if you like high heels. Fun time."}
{"text":"Meh - six bucks for a stale can of beer. The red wine was undrinkable. If you're a hipster, maybe that's cool, but life is too short for bad drinks."}
{"text":"I came to Valley Bar for the first time on a first date with someone, and I'm not gonna lie... for a brief moment, I wondered if he was taking me down a dark alley to off me. I have never been so glad to see a bouncer in my life. LOL From what I hear, the fact that it's \"hidden\" is part of the allure, but... yeah... no... not for me. Anyway, I'm including an image of the area from Google Maps to help guide others in. Even after going there a couple times, I still get turned around and it breaks my brain. 

My main tips are: 
1) Know where the heck you're going and know where the heck you're going to park in advance.
2) Bring your ID. They card. Every. Single. Time. Even if you're 50. You won't get in without ID. 
3) Don't arrive drunk or bring contraband. I came after dinner once and had leftovers in my purse. It was a no-go. I threw them out and was let in. No big deal. I've seen lots of people denied entry and have heard stories about friends who have not been let in because they'd already been drinking.

This is a really cool bar overall. It's one I would want to bring my out-of-state/ out-of-town friends to for the pure novelty of it. I love the décor and the themed drinks. It is pretty cool that it's underground, and, yeah... now that I'm \"in the know,\" and did not die on my first visit there, I do kind of like that it's hidden.

I've gone a few times just for the bar. Their cocktails are pretty awesome. I'm not personally a fan of their food. I ordered garlic fries on my last visit and they were ice cold when I got them, but you don't go to this kind of place for the food anyway. I haven't attended a game night or trivia night, but I want to. I prefer weeknights because it's not so crowded and you can get a seat. Don't count on sitting on the weekend. 

I've also attended a few concerts here. The music areas are very tiny and you get to be close to the performers. After my most recent one, we went to Cornish Pasty after and had a bite to eat... the band actually came in to eat as well. We let them be, but I still got a little star struck. 

I would also like to give a word of caution to women traveling alone. I met up with a friend for a concert here and we travelled separately. I parked in one of the nearby garages and then walked to Valley Bar. However, right after I left, I was approached by a man who then attempted to follow me to my car. It was one of the most frightening events of my life- I could not shake him and he wouldn't go away. I ended up sitting with a lot attendant at a different garage until the guy left. From now on, I'll probably take a Lyft to my car or won't walk alone, even if it's just a block or two. This is not a safe area to be in alone at night. That's not Valley Bar's fault by any means, but I'm spreading the word so you other ladies out there stay safe!

This isn't a place I work into my normal routine, but it's nice when a good band is playing or I need a little novelty. I'm not sure why others have had issues with \"age discrimination\" and such. I've met up with people in their 40s and 50s there and they had no issue getting in. I'm also in my 30s and would describe myself as a BBW. They've never once made any kind of remark about my age, appearance, or weight. I've had to spend five minutes digging for my ID and been flustered at the door because I forgot to have it ready. I've never had an issue getting in and never had an issue with the staff. It certainly has a hipster vibe and attracts a younger crowd. I tend to be more drawn to the artsy dives versus this, but it's a good place from my personal experiences- you just have to know what you're getting into first."}
{"text":"Great underground bar and music venue. The door is through an alley and down one set of stairs. Very laid back."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Took the wife to see David Ramirez and had a blast. We arrived around 7p on a Saturday evening and the place was very low key and not super busy. It was easy to get to the bar and order drinks. There are 3 rooms: the bar, the game room, and the dance/music room. The bar is cozy, with booths, tables and a corner couch setup as a faux living room. Choose your spot and a server will check on you to make sure there are no empty glasses. You can also elect to wander up to the (large) bar to grab a cocktail. There are several microbrews on tap as well as a large bottle/can selection. My wife ordered a Sandra Day Old Fashioned (cocktails are names after historic AZ figures) and she loved it. There's a shadow box art installation hanging over the bar that tells the story of an infamous AZ killer from many decades ago- the story is on the drink menu if you're curious.

The game room also has a few booths as well as several options to pass time. I saw billiards, board games, pinball, and darts. It was cool to see folks bringing classic board games back to their booths for playing- a great concept. We didn't spend much time here as this was a bit more crowded. 

David went on around 8:30p so we headed to the music room, sectioned off by doors. You'll show your tickets, receive a wristband and then you're allowed in. The place is mostly standing room only with a very few hightop table chair sets in the far back. There's a second bar in this room so you don't have to move between rooms for a refill. Drinks are affordable- around $5-$6 for a beer and $8 cocktails. The acoustics in the room were great, very well balanced. David performed a killer set, we got to hang out with him after the show and he signed our vinyl. After the show (10p) the bar was packed, house music was loud and people were having a great time. Be prepared to shout a bit through your conversations, but that doesn't really matter if you've had enough to drink. 

The Valley Bar has quickly become a staple hang in downtown PHX. It's a cool basement bar under same ownership as Crescent Ballroom and Van Buren. You can tell the owners take pride in hosting awesome musical acts and giving their patrons a unique experience with great drinks and tasty food. We parked about 1.5 blocks away off Adams and it was $15 (public garage). Look for the Cornish Pasty restaurant and the alleyway entrance to Valley Bar is literally next to there. There's a fenced area for the smokers.

Private lockable bathroom as soon as you enter, with more back in the bar room area. Bouncers were very nice to us, no issues there at all."}
{"text":"Phoenix is so fucking lit these days.

Alley entrances to dimly lit basement bars. I mean, how cool are we?

Things I like: the couches, the cool servers, all sorts of fun board and card games, shuffleboard, pool tables, the music venue with bar inside, the people watching.

Things I don't like: walking out after a super hipster band finished their set. I feel so self-conscious. Turn those judgemental eyes behind those oversized fake glasses towards the direction you are vaping and let me live my life!!!

Start your bar crawling here early before the place gets too packed and there's a line to get in."}
{"text":"This bar is great. I've been several times with friends and had planned on returning in the future. Me and several friends arrived and were denied entry at 1030 pm on Thursday the 8th of March. The bouncer denied us entry without explanation so we left disappointed in the rude behavior of the bouncer and the lack of customer service.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very quaint whole in the wall place. Cool bar to the left and venue to straight ahead. I've been in a few times and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I would like to give this a really bad review so as to not encourage any more people to patronize. I want it to be my own hidden little gem. But that wouldn't be fair. The Valley bar is just cool in every way. From it's fairly hidden alley entrance, its super creative shadow dancing mobile bar installation, and its dark basement feel. 

It's a must--if you can find it!"}
{"text":"Had fun on a Monday!  Happy hour was great...$8 charcuterie and free gaming.  Norm kicked ass at skeeball but I won darts!  Next..."}
{"text":"My first impression while waiting a full hour in line was that no bar in in Phoenix could be worth that wait.  I was not proven wrong.  We had to meet some friends who were already inside so we gave it a try. Despite the somewhat unique offerings on the inside, I would not return unless there was no wait.

I'm not sure what they were shooting for in their atmosphere.  They tried going for the speakeasy feel with an alleyway entrance, but on the inside, they couldn't decide what to settle on.  There was a dimly lit bar area with scattered high tops. There was an area with a few booths and board/game offerings including Connect-4 and Jenga.  Also nearby was an area where you could play skee-ball lanes, pool, shuffle board, or one of 2 arcade games. There was yet another area with live music/salsa (Friday night).

The bartenders that night were attentive, and I never waited long for a drink.  I tried the Big Nowakowski, which is basically a Mudslide with a splash of Ancho Reyes Chile Liqueur.

As for patrons, it was a younger crowd, mostly dressed down with many donning the ubiquitous t-shirt and shorts that unfortunately plagues Arizona's night scene.

The deal breaker for this bar with multiple personalities was the hour-long wait, and the seemingly disorganized manner in which they allowed people to enter.  There were two lines, the long one for the bar, and the faster line seemingly for the salsa night.  However, once entering and walking down the stairs, it was unclear whether anyone would have known which line you came from(so why wait in the longer one?).  Also, while in line, one bouncer with his 8\" goatee made me feel a bit uncomfortable with his overly patriotic sentiments directed at me.  Was I not standing in line patriotically enough? I don't know, but I'll try harder if there is a next time, sorry.

If you'd like to have the combination speakeasy/dive/mini dave-n-busters/live music+salsa experience, then this is your place."}
{"text":"I've been to Valley Bar a handful of times and I can say that it is definitely a hit or miss. If you want to try this place out, I recommend looking them up on Facebook / etc. prior to making plans because the bar has a different theme almost every night so, it can be a little awkward walking into the place without any insight on the theme of night/music. 
 It is a Speakeasy therefore, it is underground which, is personally my favorite part. The physical appearance of the bar is nice especially if you know the historical background of \"speakeasies\". I gave it a four because I do like going to this bar because of its appearance.. however, I would love if they played better music (no matter what the theme/genre of music there is that night). They have such a great facility that by simply playing a little better music, would help tremendously. I would love to see this bar expand its different groups of customers.. And I feel, better music would be key regardless of the theme."}
{"text":"I love this place, the set up is great and the drinks are delicious. I stop in probably about once a week because it's the close to me and is just a lot of fun. Recently I've noticed that the music has gotten extremely loud in the bar and it's kind of off putting. I loved this place when it first opened but now it's like a screaming match every time I come in. Still a great spot!"}
{"text":"Went to see a concert but it's so much more ! It's down an alley on the left side - you'll see dumpsters, a bike rack and a glowing red neon sign . If you think it'll be difficult to find I put up pics from several angles . You have to go down a flight of stairs - then it's like being in a hideaway speakeasy spot . To the left is the bar/food area . I didn't stay on that side too long but what a chill , cool vibe . High tops and booths were available. Cool drink menu -exactly what you'd expect for a place like this . Above the bar had this giant shade that was lit with shadows circling around- I'm wasn't tripping out , I swear . I'd definitely come back just to chill on that side . Couches and other areas to hang too . 

The concert area - good size ,low ceilings. Lowly lit . Bar area for drinks with high tops in the back . Felt like it could've jammed in about 300 people . The stage was a decent size . No bad views . The sound was great . You can get up close to the performance, no barricade. 

I highly suggest checking this place out . Bar staff and security were all cool . Left about 11:45 on a Wednesday and the bar side was busy and there was a good amount of people wanting in . Don't wait , just go ."}
{"text":"This bar definitely has the speakeasy vibe to it. As with a lot of speakeasy's, finding the place is half the battle. The Valley Bar is located in an alley in Downtown Phoenix. Follow the smell of urine to get there LOL. 

Once inside, it's a pretty cool spot. The bar is divided into two sections. One is a bar with very cool art on display. There are ample seats and games such as shuffleboard, pool, and darts available. As with speakeasy's, the place is dim with an underground feel. 

We got beers and a few shots. All the drinks were well made and affordable for a bar. The people were chill too, but there were lots of sugar daddies with their sugar babies there that night lol. Not sure if this is a common occurrance here. 

We actually came here for a small Indie concert for a band called The Cave Singers. Tickers were $12/each so it was very cheap. The concert is located next to the bar but you have to go through a door to get there. The concert venue itself is basically a stage with an empty area to stand. It is not the biggest place it can feel cramped with a lot of people. The concert venue does present a more intimate feel so you can get up close to your favorite bands. 

I would recommend the Valley Bar if you want a nice low-key night in Downtown or checking out a smaller Indie band."}
{"text":"What a great place to spend your Friday night!  This basement bars entrance is located in an alley off Monroe maybe Central?  Inside you will find yourself in either the lounge area, the hidden room,  the game room or performance area. Great crowd, clean restrooms,  cool art, live music, good drinks, good times!  Looking forward to my next visit to Valley Bar!"}
{"text":"I paid for New Year's Eve party, and they kicked me out because they said I was too intoxicated. I was not too intoxicated. In fact, I went to other bars after and the bar tenders were all good to me and kept serving because I was fine. When I politely asked to speak to management they told me they were going to call the cops. They also kicked out another person just because they said I was their friend and I was not too drunk. Naturally, I respect the fact that they practice solidarity with what the bouncer says, but they may want to consider different bouncers. This is a shame, I enjoyed that place, but I and my friends (about 20 or so) have agreed to never go there again, unless they apologize and refund my ticket. It only takes a few bad experience to ruin a reputation, I sincerely hope that management realizes that this was all a mistake and reach out."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday, and it was interesting & different (I mean that in a good way though). The entrance is literally in a back alley & you walk down a flight of stairs to get to the main part of the bar (well...it feels like two bars). 

Honestly, I didn't really \"experience\" much while I was here, but I did really like the atmosphere. Like I said, it feels like two different bars. There's kind of the \"main\" restaurant/bar area. I came after dinner so I didn't try the food. There's a really cool round bar area in this room with this interesting canvas decor that really gave it a unique vibe. Our party was in the small back room, which they went to after dinner. By the time we got there the room was packed so me and one of my friends went to the other bar area, which is basically just a large concrete area where there's live music. We caught the tail end of one band and the start of another. I don't remember either band's name, but they were both enjoyable. 

I just had a couple beers, but it does look like Valley Bar has some fun cocktails I'd like to try next time I come back."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this spot. The ambiance is amazing and it always smells so good here! It smells like a vanilla musk. The atmosphere in here is very artsy and laid back. I have been here twice and plan on coming back and bringing every friend I know!"}
{"text":"Something about this place I really enjoy. My coworker has told me several times she is not a fan, but I have been three times and enjoyed it each time. I went once during the Viva PHX music festival and that was a bit too crowded; however, going on other nights it was great. It is a little hard to find, and it's downstairs kind of secluded, but I think that is the charm. I love the fact they have Hamm's beer. I know that is unusual to get excited about, but it used to be my dad's favorite and since he died I usually try to find it on father's day or on our birthday (we had the same birthday). He used to drink Hamm's and listen to music in the basement. Now I can go here, drink Hamm's and listen to music in the basement."}
{"text":"After walking around the block downtown a few times trying to figure out how to get in (and having to go against my instincts to avoid the dark alleyway), my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised to find such a cool bar. The drinks were great (and Phoenix/Arizona themed which is neat) and I was bummed that we didn't have room for food since it all looked great. The bar is super interesting and has lots of awesome things to look at or do (hello, skeeball). I'm pretty sure at least one thing in the bar is haunted but it made for a lot of fun. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Valley Bar is reminiscent of a speakeasy and the entrance is stashed in an alley way (across the street from Seamus McCaffrey's, follow the red light).

Upon entry there is a flight of stairs descending into a dark dank basement. Once you go through the doors at the end of the stairs, you instantly feel like you have traveled to a different decade. 

The bar is decorated with spinning metal mobiles,  writh their shadows being protected onto canvas that is draped above the bar. A focal wall is covered with kitschy vintage paintings, everything is so visually appealing.

There are free table top games (jenga!) and an entire game room next to the venue entrance.

I've been here a few times, and weekdays seem to be the best if you don't like crowds (Monday for specials). If you show up after 10pm on a Friday or Saturday, expect to wait in aline."}
{"text":"Cool place. Would be better if they would make their drinks better for the price. I got a Manhattan and it was awful. It just tasted like whiskey on the rocks which I should have order instead because it probably would have been cheaper. Another thing  it takes like 20 mins to get asked for a drink. Last night we were waiting forever and the bartenders are so rude. He didn't even say hi. All my life I worked in restaurants is it so hard to have good customer service or is it ok just to be dicks now. It's cool now I guess."}
{"text":"Really cool and unique concert venue and bar. Love that it's a small and intimate venue. Really good sound quality and friendly staff. 

Love the eclectic decor and the different themed rooms. 


Slightly difficult to find because it's in a basement and you'll have to walk through an alley to enter."}
{"text":"This is a fun spot.  I live downtown and I kept hearing people talk about the 'bar in the alley' so I was bored and walked over there a couple weeks ago.  I\"m glad I did.  It's not as confusing as some say.  The easiest way to find it is walk across the street from Seamus and you'll see a door guy sitting outside on a chair.  Not sure how people complicated the simplicity of finding it so much!  Anyways, you'll get your ID checked at the door and down you go.  Follow the steps down and hang a left.  It's a neat old feeling in here.  It almost feels like an old speak easy.  It's very dimly lit with the tables and bar illuminated by candles.  It has a real unique vibe.  Nice open seating area with little two-person booths that surround some high top tables leading up to the bar.  On the right hand side of the bar there are some more booths where you can play games or just keep heading back to the game room.  They have shuffleboard, pool tables and a few other games.  I personally wouldn't go here just for the games because it might disappoint you tad but it's a nice perk for when the booze kicks in.  The one thing that separates this bar from many others similar bars in the area is the friendliness of the staff, from the door guys to the bartenders.  Everyone is friendly and you don't find much attitude down there.  It's also a perk that the couple times I've been here lately they have oldies playing.  Definitely fits the vibe."}
{"text":"Hipster bar for a lower 30s crowd, cool speak easy environment with middle tier music. If you smoke Blue Spirits and still own a Polaroid camera you'll make friends here"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time going to this dump. They discriminate based on age, gender and beauty.  In an age where acceptance and tolerance is paramount, No one with any self respect should frequent this bar."}
{"text":"Best place out there. Whenever in downtown Phoenix, I will definitely be here. Cheap drinks, clean bathrooms, and tons of games. Enough said."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself at this bar.  It's  located in the basement of this building and since I'm from the Midwest I felt right at home.  We had to enter from the alley which wasn't too bad minus the smell from the nearby dumpsters.  The drinks were good and not your typical selections either.  It's mostly candlelit and casual so it's perfect for a little date, hanging with the girls or a big group."}
{"text":"Very Problematic
I'm gay, I'm not ashamed to say it, but I felt ashamed of it inside the Valley Bar. We got sidewards glances from the staff nonstop, I was referred to as \"boy\" (b/c I'm black, godforbid) & I was double charged, probably as a passive-aggressive FU. If you're looking for a place of tolerance & inclusion, DON'T COME TO THE VALLEY BAR! As a gay black man I have never felt more unwelcome, & I advise you to avoid this place too if you're looking for a place to chill."}
{"text":"Finding this place is half the journey. 

Don't get discouraged, take Monroe 20 paces west thru Vapors Alley ;). Dodge the sketchy Dumpster and BOOM!! Welcome to the sweetness that is Valley Bar.  

Go down the stairs into this sweet speakeasy feeing bar. They have a music room where they have live bands (enter with ticket purchase) or head on over to the bar/lounge where you can still here the band just can go into the music hall. 

Once in the lounge you'll have plenty to keep you entertained; from their rolling beers on tap to their delicious cocktails. They have a few arcade games, skeet-balls, and pool tables to keep the night going.

Kick back, relax, be merry, and repeat!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars. I like the atmosphere-- classy but relaxed. They have tons of board games, 2 pool tables and 2 dart boards. They also have a concert venue with its own bar. There can be a line to get in, so come early and stay awhile. Great cocktails too."}
{"text":"I was only here for a concert so did not experience the bar area. Folding chairs for concert area, small and dim, but an intimate setting. Loved the concert. 
Not easy to find. You have to go around the back alley of a building marked with only the address to find the entrance, downstairs and in a basement. Not kidding!"}
{"text":"Used to love this bar and come all the time, but now I'm starting to make my regular bar elsewhere. One of the specific bartenders always makes it a point to make me and friends feel unwelcome. My friend and I always get vodka crans, almost every weekend at Valley Bar. We got the one specific bartender who we already always feel gives us looks when we're in there. She made our drinks and we tasted NO alcohol. I nicely told her we come there all the time and the drinks don't taste as strong and she was very rude in replying and said she was going to have to charge us $10 for two more shots. My friend went up for a second drink to a different bartender and there was a significant difference in the taste of alcohol. Not to mention I ALWAYS have problems with my ID because I'm from out of state. I had to give three forms of ID along with have a separate bouncer come up and check my ID before I could get in.... a bit ridiculous considering I'm a regular. And unwelcoming!"}
{"text":"Take an underground space with a seedy alley entrance built in the 1940s and turn it in to a kick ass bar. Valley bar mixes so many cool ideas together there is sure to be something for everyone. Start in the Rose Room, which is free and sip on some seriously good craft cocktails. You can also enjoy delicious bites (love the charcuterie boards and the pretzels) until late at night. You can also go to the game room and challenge your friends to shuffle board, ski ball, pinball ect. 

Lastly it is a killer music venue that holds about 250 people and brings in acts from all over the place.  Indie bands to hip hop DJs, the Valley Bar is the spot. You can find hipster kids and Congressmen. Check this spot out now. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Cool joint, good cocktails, darts, skeeball, and board games.  I only went into the bar and play area, apparently there is a music venue as well.  Made for a great post ballgame date hang, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"While I'm not one to frequent this on crazy busy Friday nights cud the crowds just arnt my thing (though I know many love this place for their crowd) this bar is one of the best in Phoenix . the bar its self has a good mix of cheap drinks or top end cocktails. It almost always has some kinda cool show going on. And lots to do in the back room from skee ball to board games and pool. The bartenders are always friendly . and while ive had some off putting interactions with the security there, I'm not gonna hold that against them cus i know they dont control what comes out of their employees mouths all the time lol"}
{"text":"They no how to make a drink!!!! and I think it's cool in an alley bar in the basement.  I'm from the Midwest don't see to many basements in Phoenix ...I'll be back"}
{"text":"Such a cool place, if you like the underground, grungy, artsy type of places.  You feel like you are in someone's awesome basement!  Fun venue for drinks, playing some pool or some bar games.  They have a music venue as well.  It's been a steady part of our bar hopping nights."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to go after work. The ambience is really chill. There's a separate area for playing bar games and another for dancing. Great happy hour specials! I only give it 4 stars because the alley that you have no choice but to walk through to get to the entrance downright makes you gag from the piss smell. I had to hold my breath. But once you get inside, it's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Valley Bar, you remind me of home. As a native New Yorker, this watering hole has the elegant feel of a Williamsburg speakeasy without the unbelievably expensive pricing. Descending down a flight of stairs after turning in an alleyway, Valley Bar's appeal will become a big hit with industry regulars and hipsters looking for a date. 

I arrived on a Saturday night with my friends and immediately hit up the bar. We tried majority of the cocktails on the list, and there was not one that I was disappointed with. Every drink was intricate, delicious, and did I mention strong? There was even a room for live music, which we ended up hearing and fell in love with the band. Take a date here and you'll impress the shit out of them.

Can't wait to see this place flourish. Thanks, Valley Bar!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you are coming in for a mixed drink or a beer. So what's left off the menu? A cider. I'm mostly a cider drinker (occasionally a margarita gets thrown in there or a glass of red wine--not in the same night, though). Tonight, I was looking for a cider, but I'm not sure why I ended up with a stout (is that a beer?). Possibly the nice waiter said something about the only cider they served was in a pitcher-sized bottle. WHAT? Obviously, I didn't hear him correctly over the noise. Maybe I should have just ordered a pitcher-sized margarita.

The waiter, however, did bring me a small taste of the stout so that I would know what I was getting by ordering something out of my normal genre, and since it tasted OK, I gave a thumbs up for a 16 ouncer. Thankfully, Mark H. offered to finish it for me or rather I poured the rest of my drink into his almost empty glass while he was off in the \"reading room.\" That's a reminder to everyone to always know where your drink is at all times.

This is a pretty typical bar, and if I come here again, I'll make sure that it isn't a \"cider\" night but a margarita night."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero star if it was possible... my boyfriend is from Germany and he has a valid German visa issued by the United States and there was no way the bouncer would allow him to get in. I personally think it was totally unnecessary, considering it was our fist time in Arizona and just wanted to enjoy our one night here. 

PULL A STICK OFF YOUR ASS PPL! THANK U.

**update: we went to another bar 0.2 miles away and they let my boyfriend in with absolutely no problem...obviously it's no \"ARIZONA STATE LAW\". Whoever the owner is PLS FIRE YOUR BOUNCERS ASAP."}
{"text":"The bar has a very small neon sign with bouncers at the front entrance checking IDs. If you want to smoke they will give you a wristband so that you can get back in without any issues. There are a couple pool tables, darts, skee ball, a broken pinball machine, seating at tables, a dance floor, restrooms, and the \"secret room\"--all rather dimly lit, but ones eyes will adjust. 

Beers average $6 for a plastic cup with a decent selection on tap and in bottle. They do offer free self-serve water with small plastic cups for when you get dehydrated. The menu is a bit pricey if you get food, but overall the ambiance is decent, tho I'm pretty sure the fire marshall would have an aneurysm if he saw how packed it was. 

The bar actually goes under the road and at times you can hear/feel the rumble of vehicles passing overhead. Pretty solid downtown spot if your looking to blow some money and chill with the people. 

Go check it out!"}
{"text":"I HATE to tell you what I really think because I dread the day that I am waiting outside to come in. This is a BAD ass joint and it comes with great service and fabulous cocktails! If your favorite speak easy married your favorite venue and had a baby, it would be Valley Bar. Come, don't come...ha!"}
{"text":"This review is gonna be really long, so the short version is this: There's rad music, groovy games, a kitchen, and a baller cocktail menu. If you're browsing the mobile app and you're nearby, you need to drop in. Like, now. 

Still with me? OK, here are the details...

There is no place in Phoenix I will defend as much as Valley Bar. Seriously, it's my litmus test for whether or not I'm going to like your reviews--give this gem less than five stars, and I'll take everything you write with a grain of salt. 

It's just that good.

It's an eclectic establishment with the quintessential Phoenix vibe--artsy and unassuming, attracting clientele from gruff hipsters looking for indie shows, to the all dolled-up in five inch heels treating this like a club, to businessmen and politicians coming in wearing full suits.

I met Congressman Ruben Gallego while drinking a Kate + Ruben. He didn't seem amused when I said \"Hey there's a drink named after you amirite?\" 

On another evening, I shook hands with mayor Greg Stanton while drinking a Stanton. Groovy, right?

 I keep ordering my favorite cocktail--The McCain--but the old 'Maverick' is yet to show up! Bummer, but at least I can revel in the sweet, smoky, spicy goodness of mezcal, citrus, and a mouthwatering bite from an ancho chili liquor. At $8 a pop, these craft cocktails really are a steal, and the Rose Room, the lounge they're served in, is so comfortable and dimly lit you'll feel you've stumbled into a much more expensive environment.

If you're hungry, take advantage of the kitchen run by Short Leash hot dogs, and have a seat in one of the booths. Like every other table here, it's illuminated by real candles, lending an intimate feel. We haven't invented a love potion quite yet, but let me tell you right now that having a chat and playing one of their many board games over a glass of wine will certainly suffice. Just down the hall will be a cool game room with pool tables, ski-ball, and a couple of awesome arcade games. 

It's important to remember that above all, this is a music venue! Emphasis on medium-sized indie shows, but they have stellar DJ sets. My favorite is Blunt Club, the hip hop night that brings the best Thursday night fun I've had in the valley. Some of the local bands are especially great, and tons of fun. 

This is up there with my favorite spots in Phoenix, but of course there will be some growing pains. This place is just so gosh darn popular, it's near impossible to get in during prime time. I have waited 20 minutes for this, something I won't do for any other establishment. It can get terribly busy on Saturday--I've heard of hour-long lines close to midnight! Be prepared for standing room only! Also, keep in mind some shows/sets that used to be free now carry a charge, and this will be the rare time I hope entry gets more expensive so as to thin down the line a bit. 

I can easily spend several hours here without getting bored. It's fun, affordable, hip...I just do not have enough good words.

{"text":"Love the atmosphere here! Been to the Valley Bar a few times now and have enjoyed myself each time. The entrance is located off an alley along Central Ave in the heart of downtown Phoenix, so it's a little hard to find but manageable (follow the pin on the map). Most nights, there's no cover but there are some exceptions (e.g. $3 cover for donation for LGBTQ+ orgs in Phoenix). Also, it is an underground bar with stairs going down & up, so just a heads up.

There are multiple areas once you get downstairs. There's two bars, an area for live music/DJ & dancing, a couple of areas with bar tables for lounging, and an area with games (pool tables, board games, etc). The vibe here is more hipster-like, and I like how you can be dancing in one room, then take a break and play games on the other side. The happy hour here is pretty decent, and I've had nothing but good experiences with the bartenders. Servers also round the tables to take orders, which is always nice.

There's not really designated parking, so I'd suggest finding street parking (most meters around here stop enforcing after 10pm), find other paid parking in the area, or use uber/lyft."}
{"text":"I want there on a Friday night and I had a blast. There was live band of side and then games on the other side. I want to say it was a Colombian band. I went with 2 of my friends and we salsa dance for a couple of hours. On the other side, they were games you could play and seemed like a chilled lounge spot."}
{"text":"Yo this spot is lit as hell. Phoenix needed this. I'm so proud of you guys. Thank you for bringing the funk."}
{"text":"Was a little sketched out trying to find the alley entrance. My immediate reaction(s): \"Is this where Bruce Wayne lost his parents? Can three twenty-somethings muscle their way out of a mugging? Is this bar hip enough to offer artisanal pizza rolls as fare?\"

After being briefly stopped by the doorman, all thanks to the curse of my boyish good looks, and one accidental tumble down a set of stairs later, I took my first step in and immediately found myself digging the feel of this place. The actual bar feels like a sleek and hip anachronism nestled in the bosom of a venue that almost boasts a kind of kitschy, divey Goodwill chic. Ended up going fairly light on my tab since I had gone in on a few drinks over dinner. Grabbed a Stella (tried and true) and was curious to try the McCain. I found out that night that I am NOT a fan of Mezcal. Even still, I fully appreciated Valley for crafting a drink that left the same unpalatable taste in my mouth that Arizona politics are typically prone to do.

Pool and darts available towards the back, as well as an assortment of games. We went for Uno. Loved the mix of music playing. Felt like the weirder side of my Spotify, and I was entirely into that. I'd definitely be interested to come back for a night of live music sometime soon. I've been nothing but glad to see all these great new places springing up in Phoenix; excited to pop in the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Only been here on Sundays. One of the first bars I went to when I moved to Phoenix. The bartenders are always nice and attentive; the place doesn't open till 6PM on Sunday's but it's all day happy hour featuring $5 old fashioned. I'll take my friends here when they come visit."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in downtown Phoenix by a long shot. Great happy hour specials, delicious food, friendly service and a nice ambiance. Good beer selection, strong cocktails, and the house wine (like $4-5 a glass for happy hour) is great!

I'm not a big fan of salads, but the ones they serve here are delicious!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, underground bar (literally), good food and lots of drink choices. The bar gets packed on weekends."}
{"text":"My favorite venue for live music in Phoenix.  It's a small room, but the sound is good.  Especially nice for solo acoustic type acts, but great for full bands as well.  The bartenders are fab, and the drink menu is interesting.  They have a locally distilled gin that makes a lovely, light-flavored gin & tonic--give it a try."}
{"text":"Drinks were great, food was great and the dead Sara concert rocked.    Best place for small show in all of AZ."}
{"text":"OMG This place is way cool, comfortable and relaxing with kind a funky atmosphere. A fair beer selection, wines, spirits and great food. Well the food menu is simple with an awesome variety of rustic flat bread (pizza) selections and really cool salads (Kale, Arugula, quinoa, Chorizo, Sweet Potato ect...)

Beer is cold and all of the staff are friendly, great service. Hands down, this is my bar when I return  to Phoenix.

Oh, the location is a little weird in the back dark ally and is in the basement of an old building. It all ads to the experience. You will definitely like!"}
{"text":"There wasn't any event but paid a $3 cover fee to check it out. It was crowded and loud, no music in the background. After waiting 15 minutes at the bar, trying to get one of the bartender's attention, I left. I don't see the appeal. BTW, the lobby was cluster f* with people everywhere. For a first timer, how are suppose to know where to pay the cover fee. My money was better spent across the alley."}
{"text":"4 out of 5 service the handful of times I've been. Tonight ordered the Artichoke and Spinach Naan. Naan should be soft and it wasn't at all, instead crispy,  the dip was mediocre at best. I want to support my local places, but I unfortunately can't recommend the food at this time. Hope to see an improvement soon."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out however the capacity and line you have to wait in is ridiculous. People that have tickets to \"a show\" are allowed in and access to the bar. If you want to come and hang out without tickets to a show, expect a long wait. Drinks are average. Ambiance is cool."}
{"text":"Hello, last Saturday my best friend and I wanted to celebrate my birthday early. We got a room at the Westin, decided we would go to Valley Bar for dinner and drinks. This was our favorite spot downtown. I will admit that at the Westin we did pre-game and enjoyed our time getting ready. We didn't drink all day and night but we did have a few drinks in us. We walked to Valley Bar from our room and as we didn't expect it there was no line to get in. We showed security our i.d's and my friend and I headed downstairs to the bar first. It wasn't too busy and a booth opened up so my friend went to grab us a table, I stayed at the bar to order drinks and food. I was up at the bar for about 10 mins waiting for drinks and to pay, once I paid cash I told them where my table was I carried our drinks over to my friend and I and then about 5 minutes later a man came to our table with our food ready to go. He stated that he needed us to leave and that he had our food boxed up for us. My friend asked why that was. They stated that I was too intoxicate to be in the building. My friend asked since we had our drinks if we could finish them, the lady with him who was the manager that night stated that we could to the stairs of the building. Since we had just got them, my friend asked for a refund instead and they said okay. She left to get our refund and the man stayed at our table. While she was away my friend ask if I was too impaired and we needed to leave, why did the bartender serve her then? He stated that all 3 bartenders told him that my friend ordered the drinks, which was untrue. At this time another boy who worked there was waiting with them, when my friend proceeded to tell them that was not true and what we could do the young man told her to look at my eyes, they are so big that I am clearly on something. She told him he had no right to make any accusation so the sort and asked for his name. He told her that he did not have to give her his name she said whatever. At this point the manager had returned, gave me my cash and we proceeded to leave. My friend told them they could go but they stated all 3 needed to follow us out. I hurried, my friend didn't. Mind you at this point, volume level isn't higher people are not looking so we are just walking out. My friend did tell them as we were on the stairs though that she felt that she did not handle the best way since she was ahead of the manager she stopped on the stairway to tell Kat this. Kat told her that we were drunk and did not know what we were talking about and then she placed her hand around my friends arm. Calmly, which is rare for my best friend, asked that she removed her arm told her that she was not security and had no right to touch her. Kat tighten her grip my friend asked for her name she said it proudly while mentioning that she was the manager. My friend said okay walked to the top of the stairs with Kats arm around her still. Once we were out the security at the front and the bus boy who would not give us his name shouted out no to return that I was on something and she needed to be a good friend and get me home. 

We do not do drugs and like anyone do not appreciate being accused of being on them. We were out for my birthday and we did our best to not cause any scene while leaving. We feel as though the staff made a bigger deal and did not handle the situation in the best manner at all. We should have been asked to leave by the bartender and not served drinks if I am too impaired. If I got the drinks and paid for them and you are asking me to leave, why not have my refund ready with a simple, hey sorry you got this drinks this is the situation would you mind leaving or how about if you think someone is too impaired to be in the building and your management, you don't place your hand on them and allow security to do their job.
 We just felt at though the situation could have been handle a lot better. Due to this we will never recommend Valley Bar due to the lack of customer service. If it would have been handled better, we would be happy to come back but even the bus boy shouting at us to never come back at the end was enough to just say good bye. This happened on Saturday and I thought I would be over it but I honestly can not get over how rude those 3 were to us. Also, I feel as though we were treated this way because they did believe we were too impaired. They did not except us to request a refund for our drinks, that why they didn't have it. They did not except us to ask why I was served if I was to impaired so they came up with the lame excuse of the \"3\" bartenders claim my friend ordered the drink which is completely untrue and I believe that because we asked all these the bus boy accused me of being on drugs and the sad part is that we do remember. I know exactly how we were treated and I'm sorry, it was extremely rude on some many levels. Not one of those 3 thought they were in the wrong. We understand company policies we did our best to co"}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem. Apparently everyone knows about it though. Place was packed on a Friday night. I love how different rooms have something going on. One room had a live band playing. Another was full of games (shuffle board, skew ball, pool tables, board games, etc), even stumbled in one in the corner with a closed door that lead to a room that was setup as a living room, very quiet and chill. They have a full menu of great food options and drinks. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of some of the dives/hangouts/pubs I used to frequent in my formative adult years.
The waiters are cool and friendly, which makes a huge difference especially when the bar is new and unusual and has a story to tell. Angel, our waiter, was really helpful and attentive.
There are about four distinct areas in this establishment and each one exudes a different vibe.
The bar: pretty standard but many tables and booths for getting friendly with your latest amour.
The game room: cool games and fun space.
The reading room: interesting space. Lots of opportunity for a variety of activities behind closed doors. Whips and chains? Check the schedule on the clipboard for a list of events.
The live music bar: you pay a cover charge for some awesome music.
Every time you come here expect a different experience."}
{"text":"BAR VALLEY BAR - AGEIST 
\"Too intoxicated\" is getting to be a very familiar/annoying term being thrown around by Valley Bar security and management lately. But now being \"TOO OLD\" is also an issue at Valley Bar?? As a regular of Valley Bar (Most likely never going back after this incident), I have noticed the increased anger and short-temperaments of security, management and staff.

If you laugh too loud, accidentally trip, or stumble, you are thrown out for being \"too intoxicated\". If you are waiting in line and are laughing and making loud noises with your buddies, Security will immediately call you out and refuse entrance because you're \"too intoxicated\". 

But now... being \"TOO OLD\" is also a problem for Valley Bar management and security?? 

A group of friends and I, ages 30-45, were out having a wonderful evening in downtown Phx and decided to join Valley Bar's 80's night (Oh the irony!). As we were walking up laughing and having a good time, we stood by the door to have our ID's checked. The bouncer, within 2 SECONDS of looking at us, told us we were \"too intoxicated\" to come inside. After politely trying to reason with the bouncer that we were not \"too intoxicated\", the discussion turned heated, when of course we were rudely asked to leave, but not before being told that we were \"TOO OLD to be here anyway.\" (This comment made by a heavier-set, bearded guy with stretched earlobes). I immediately asked to speak with a manager after this horrible Ageist comment was made, but the bouncer refused to call his manager. 

So I approached a different bouncer, and after a bit of back-and-forth was I able to convince him to have the manager step outside to talk to me. Which seemed to be a fruitless conversation anyway when Adam, the manager came out simply shaking his head, and without asking ANY questions asked us to leave because we were rude to his guy first!  

Adam did not care to ask me or the bouncer any questions as to what ACTUALLY happened, nor questioned his bouncer's ageist comment. It took him all but 3 seconds to determine that we were rude and never questioned his bouncer's judgement over being \"too intoxicated\" aka \"too old\"!! 

Adam did nothing to assess the situation and make a proper decision. Instead Adam thought it appropriate to allow Age discrimination on his bouncer's behalf and asked us to leave! 

Is this Valley Bar's new point of view: AGE DISCRIMINATION. Valley Bar hires these individuals who have a problem with Age, and are apparently at liberty to weed out the older generation or anyone else they feel is \"too intoxicated\" or \"too old\". Also, I wasn't aware Valley Bar staff were well-trained human breathalyzers!! 

It's a real shame too Valley Bar, especially because Central Phoenix prides itself in being open and accepting of anyone's sex, creativity, sexual-preference, and AGE! 

Note: I have left two messages to the managers at Valley bar to call me about this situation. I have been ignored twice."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere that has its own unique vibe. Staff was open, knowledgeable, and could multitask which I respect greatly when things get busy. Menu deserves praise. It has the essentials, decent price and good quality. The drink menu is somewhat the same. Looked to have any mix drink, but beer menu is a little short, missing some of the better known local brews. And lastly, I didn't plan a head! There looked to be an interesting show on that night and there were no tickets left! Make sure to plan ahead and purchase your tickets online."}
{"text":"Love the vibe! I live in Tempe but am not a college student and drive out of my way to hang here with friends. It's a chill spot where you won't be judged if you come straight from work in a tie or in jeans/ t-shirt. Relaxed environment, board games, darts, ski ball, couches, signature cocktails and DOUGHNUTS! What isn't there to like??"}
{"text":"This place is strange with a capital s! I guess the night we went there were a few different things going on that we could not figure out exactly what the band was playing. I like him this to be more of a college hangout spot where a bit older than that we had a drink or two and then left. The bar was interesting the decor also interesting I could definitely see that this would be a fine place if I were in my very early 20s but it was not really a place for a couple out for date night."}
{"text":"So I originally reviewed this place 5 stars and I have since deleted that review and I won't ever be back. Sorry, Charlie! Let me begin by saying that I had a rough time with this place a few weeks back and I assumed that my experience was a result of a new bouncer that was trying desperately to display his newfound grip of authority. I brushed that night off and figured that I just picked a bad night. Whatever.

A few weeks go by and my friend hits me up about showing her around downtown Phoenix for her 21st birthday. Valley Bar was our second stop after having one drink at a neighboring bar. We all get drinks and I begin showing them around the place. As we are walking around, one of the chicks stumbled on a cone. She didn't fall, nor did she spill her drink. She simply stumbled. None of us thought anything of it and we end up sitting at a table. A few minutes go by and someone comes up and grabs her by the arm and tells her that she has to leave. The group laughed thinking that they were joking around with the group of the birthday girl, so they continue hanging out. Maybe a minute goes by until a group of macho men eager for action come storming in absolutely terrifying these chicks. The group of chicks all saying, \"Relax! Relax! We will see ourselves out!\". One of the bouncers even apologized to us once we were outside saying that he realizes that none of us are intoxicated. So yea, we got kicked out because a clumsy chick tripped on a cone. I should mention that this was the first time at Valley Bar for all six of the people that I was showing around. Needless to say, none of these people will be back. 

Moral of the Story: Don't stumble as you walk through the Valley of the shadow of angry bouncers."}
{"text":"This place is tiny but cool! When it comes to seeing a concert here its intimate & the crowd I encountered was fun! Loved seeing Albert Hammond Jr.  Here and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I wish this place existed when I was living in Phoenix and working downtown. We would have never found it but for our hip Uber driver who suggested it to us. 

To get in, you walk down the alley across from Seamus McCaffrey's. There will be a door guy on your left just a bit in (no cover!) As you descend down a long staircase, let the hip vibes wash over you. When you're downstairs-head left. Literally no idea what's on the right. There was some weird elevator and other odd happenings. Maybe this is an advanced level for bar goers. 

The bar is gorgeous and looks straight out of the 1920s. Excellent mixologists whipping up delicious cocktails off of their signature menu. I had the mezcal drink and it we perfection. Ok, I had two. :) 

My only issue is the confined space and lackluster ventilation. We were here on a Monday, so it wasn't too busy, but I could see it getting pretty murky down there with a bigger crowd. 

Nice to see some life coming to DT Phoenix. It's actually starting to feel like a downtown with places like this! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Meh. Trying wayyy too hard to be cool and copy LA. For some reason they think they have a right to charge more than every other place in phx for a drink and serve you in a plastic cup if you're hanging out in the room that has the band (by the way, this is the only room that has decent ventilation). 

I look forward to the next place that offers games & drinks in downtown and doesnt make you walk thru a dirty alleyway just because they want to be oh so edgy."}
{"text":"I came here on blunt night and i had a blast i met alot of ppl add took loads of pictures only thing is some of the bartenders suck at making a easy margarita"}
{"text":"Always down to go downtown to valley bar! Just discovered their secret library, go find it your self, it's an adventure!

Drinks are awesome and the music is always great. I  enjoy their theme parties the most! Indie dance part and their soul music night are my fav!  Try the Janet Neoplatini. You will thank me later."}
{"text":"Another placeholder so my pictures link. I'll update with details later, but the 5 star rating holds true."}
{"text":"I love this bar so much.  It reminded me of being back home in the bay area.  The drinks and service are amazing and well-priced.  I can't say much about the live music portion, as I haven't been in that room very long, but the lounge area is a great atmosphere and has some awesome, good vibes goin' on."}
{"text":"I was at valley bar and had no problem with the bouncer ... but I seen him get aggressive with some females calling them drunk they seem fine to me !! But once I seen this I finish my drink and will not be back !"}
{"text":"The Valley Bar has got to be one of my favorite spots downtown. It's new to Phoenix and it's doing an incredible job thus far. It's kinda hard to find on a map because it's tucked back in an alley and you have to head downstairs to get in...yeah it's awesome. 

Once you get downstairs there's only fun to ensue! You have some variety to choose from...you can go in the showroom which usually has a local band playing a set. I went there on a night for a more popular band and it was so much fun being right up close! They have a bar within the showroom and no matter where you are it's 21+ so that's always nice.

There's another room that I'll label as the game room. In there you will find skiball, shuffleboard, pool tables, darts, TMNT video arcade and I believe Double Dragon on video arcade. I was so consumed in TMNT last time that I forgot there were other games there. (I think they might have gotten rid of this game since the last time I was there but fingers crossed it's still there!!) Mostly because it was parked right next to the change machine that I kept feeding $1's and $5's to. 

Then you have some booth seating between the games and the other large bar which I will label the main bar. If you're lucky to snag a booth on a busy night, you can order some food which I have yet to try! The main bar wraps around a nice area so it's not too hard to get up there and order a drink. The bartenders have been amazing every time. They have some specialty craft cocktails that have interesting, fun flavors that are worth a try. Otherwise, they have some great local beers on tap too like my absolute favorite, the Papago Brewing Orange Blossom. When a bar has that, I'm instantly sold. 

I can't wait to head here to see more concerts and play more games with friends whilst enjoying delicious beverages."}
{"text":"Been coming to Valley Bar a lot since moving back to the Downtown Phoenix area.  

This is a great place to take friends and family if you're looking for a fun night out.  The theme is Basement Speakeasy, but they also have a full kitchen.  Delicious cocktail creations, great music always playing and a back room filled with awesome bar games: such as pool, shuffle board, darts, pinball and even (2) Skee Ball Machines.  Really love the ambiance, dimly lit, hipster decor and they also offer live music.  

I was there last night (Monday) and it was $1 off beers and free games all night.  

Bottom Line:
This is one of the better bars to grab a drink and enjoy someone's company in the downtown area."}
{"text":"What a joke of a place! There was one person in line, and rather than snaking through the fences, I went through the entrance and stood in line behind one of my friends. The door man was apparently feeling grouchy and immediately said, \"that girl is not going in!\" Our group of seven is went elsewhere. Great customer service. NOT!"}
{"text":"Ok. #1 bar to go to in Phoenix, especially if you hate the bro-scene and love music, dancing and art. Heartily recommend this place to cool people to keep the scene friendly and cool! Great for dancing, bar games, hidden gems etc... the dj-ing here is Fantastic! Sometimes a 70's vibe. Love ending a night here with a few friends. Oh and I recently found out they had food here, I got a sandwich of some kind and it was pretty good actually but I usually get food across at like Cornish Pasty cause it is perfect to pair with drinking lol. Highly recommend this place (unless you are a shitty person, don't come here)!"}
{"text":"FACK VALLEY BAR!!! I was coming to celebrate after a Dbacks home opener victory, my fiancé spent $30 on a bike rider to take me to the front door just for the prick front doorman to not let us in cause my limp, or disability. We've been coming there for years and will be the last. Your establishment shouldn't get so confident in itself to were they can reject handicapped!! #kickrocks #neveragain"}
{"text":"What an awesome addition to downtown Phoenix! I went on a Monday when they not only have 1$ off draft beers, but also have free games! This includes skee ball, darts, pool, shuffleboard, and board games. We got the lucha libre ale (which was not wonderful, but did cost 2$ a pint (1!)) and had fun playing games all evening. The bar is adorable, with metal trains, cacti, and other AZ type things going around in circles overhead and being projected onto a sheet of sorts (that description was terrible, but it's really neat and you'll just have to go look at it for yourself). The cocktails look tasty, so I'll have to check them out sometime soon. 


PS the entrance is in the alley behind the building.... took us awhile to figure that one out."}
{"text":"Came to valley bar for my friend's birthday and it was our first time going out in down town Phoenix. We live in the Tempe/Scottsdale area so we thought we'd try out Phoenix for a night. They didn't let one of my friends in because he was \"too intoxicated\" but really he just has an extremely energetic personality and didn't even have that much to drink. They didn't let my second friend in because he didn't know the name of the bar we had just came from - again, this was our FIRST TIME HERE. So granted we didn't remember the name of the first bar we went to. It was very clear to me that the bouncers didn't think my friends fit the \"image\" for valley bar. First thing I noticed when I walked in was how many hipsters there were. Sorry my friends didn't look cool enough for your bar. I won't be returning here and I don't recommend you come here if you're not hipster enough."}
{"text":"Great venue! Love the secret room & skee ball!! A little expensive and there is a weird smell but whatevs!!"}
{"text":"80's New Wave Friday's are gone. About every 6 weeks it returns to Saturday nights. The DJ does not take requests, even if you throw $$$ at him. The crowd consists of a mid to late 20 somethings. The crowd was better and more mature when it was on Friday nights."}
{"text":"Such a cool concept! Valley Bar is like a modern day speakeasy!

The dim lit atmosphere adds to the whole vibe of the place. Plenty of seating areas, lots of standing room for shows, super cold AC and plenty of free games to play! So much fun!! With it being in an alley way though, I highly recommend getting an Uber or biking down there!

 Also, the kitchen food is from Short Leash and they just happen to have some pretty sweet vegan options! The vegan chili fries are to die for! 

They have some good beers on tap there too! Decently priced. Beers are the same prices as the beer at Crescent Ballroom, so that's nice."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a low rating just to keep it from being over-crowded and too popular, but I must give an honest review instead. 

I attended a concert here in the music hall and decided to come early for dinner/drinks. Speaking of which, the food is incredible. I love Short Leash, but I also like the Valley Bar only creations that they serve as well. If you are feeling like a snack or starter, then GET THE FIGS & GOAT CHEESE. I don't often use ALLCAPS, but this is worth it. Delicious in every way and served with fresh bread (you can ask/pay for extra bread if needed too). 

As for drinks, they have a great selection of wines and local beers, but I think their cocktails are the most interesting I've found around town. I love the names and great ingredient combos. My favorite is the Tom Horne-y which is kind of like a honey version of a Moscow Mule. This drink is served in a 16oz pint glass which makes it definitely worth the price too. I rarely order the same drink twice during a visit, but this one was just too good. 

I like the atmosphere and the music venue. It's much smaller than Crescent, and therefore more enjoyable. I like that they have a bar inside the venue, but I'm an even bigger fan of the fact that you can order on your restaurant/main bar tab and just ask for the drink to be put in plastic to take with you around the game tables or into the music venue. 

This place is one of the few true gems that I've discovered downtown. I guess I'll just have to hope that people can't find the unmarked door in the alleyway and end up over at the new Cornish Pasty location instead, because this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Big disappointment with the security and customer service at Valley Bar. On December 22nd I was their with some friends. Apparently a security guard who apparently is a manager \"Adam White\" thought I was laughing at him and mocking him.. had forcefully pulled me around and wanted to basically fight me, and tried to kick me out. Emailed customer service right away... this long detailed issue I had. All I got back on 12/29 was \"we are looking into this\".... Did not even get a sorry or anything. Will not go back to this bar unless I can get an update or an apology. His actions were uncalled for and I find it unprofessional in the way you handled my complaint."}
{"text":"This is my go to bar for taking friends who are visiting or otherwise have never been. The drinks are great and fairly priced, the bar has plenty of seating and things to do (games, random library room, music venue if you have tickets). I also love that you can find a quiet place to talk within the bar. Be warned it's located down a sketchy alley, there will be a bouncer outside the entrance. That being said, the inside has a great atmosphere and it's close enough to other fun bars as well!"}
{"text":"I visited Valley Bar for the first time recently on a night out in downtown Phoenix. The brief walk down what appeared to be a dark and scary alley ended pleasantly when the doorman greeted us in friendly and welcoming manner. He welcomed us to Valley Bar and asked us how our night was going. Then let us down the dark staircase...

The bar was great. Prices were reasonable, drinks were solid, service was prompt/friendly and the ambiance was low key/hipster. They had a small menu of mostly salads and flatbreads. I can vouch for the brussels bacon and egg flatbread. There was also a free show going on and the group was pretty talented. Good experience overall.

As we left, Guy the bouncer was friendly and told us about Valley's sister bar. We gave that a try as well and ended up having a great night. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Favorite spot in downtown Phoenix. No question. Love that it's always cool, that there are really fun games (battleship in the 'secret room' is my favorite happy hour activity), and that the bartenders know how to make truly quality drinks (Negroni, Manhattan, Old Fashioned, Sidecar). Pool tables are well-maintained, the dart boards are well placed such that there is no foot traffic near the board (it happens more than you think), and the skeeball... well come on. it's Skeeball. This is a great place for a few friends, a date, or just meeting people due to the long bar, nooks, booths, tables, and open flow."}
{"text":"My friend and I discovered this randomly during a night out in downtown Phoenix. It was a little bit hard to find and is located down an alley. But once you enter you will love it. 

There are a lot of little rooms and different things going on within the bar.  It looks like they have space to host shows and live bands. This bar is a unique place in the middle of downtown and definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"RAD.  Speakeasy concept, dimly lit and alluring, lots of different spaces to try out.  There are two main bar areas, one with a stage and one with lots of seats for the eating, and a gaming area with throwback arcade games and pinball.  You've got lots of options here!  I didn't get a chance to eat here, but I will if I come back. 

It feels a little sketch to find this place, which is located in an alley- but if you can find it, it's a very solid choice for an evening.  

4 stars."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for sure! The only thing I don't like is the amount of people they let in. It gets PACKED. And since you are in a basement, you may feel a bit confined. Other than that... Best place in downtown!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and would have given it 5 stars, but last night went in to buy tickets in person to a show. I had called 1/2 hour before the show to ask if it's going on and how much the ticket prices were. Online the tickets were $15, so when the guy who answered said \"$5 tickets which begin selling at 6pm\", I immediately drove the 15-20 minutes there to pick them up. I got there and was told $15. The $5 tickets were for the 6pm event, not for the 10pm one. I was quite specific on the phone about which show I was calling about. The least the person who screwed up could have done was offer the tickets to me for $5 (or even compromise at $10), but just said \"sorry\". I left and didn't bother attending the show. 45 minute waste of my time and gas. Nice bar though, but this experience will leave a permanent bad taste as I wanted to go to the show and could have bought tickets for the same price online and not wasted time and money driving there after being given the wrong info."}
{"text":"Holy crap! I can't wait to come back here! I came at midnight on a Friday and there was a line out the door. I came close to leaving when I saw the line, but man am I happy I stuck around. Such a neat bar! There are a couple different rooms, one has endless pinball, ski ball, and some other arcade games. Another room has this creepy yet cool atmosphere due to the back shadow lighting of hanging objects above the bar. I didn't stick around long because I was quite tired, but I promised myself I'd be back!"}
{"text":"I was walking around forever trying to find this place! Once I finally found it (its in the back of 130 Central, so go around the corner into the trash filled alley), I ended up having a great time.

Here are a few quick thoughts, as most other reviews seemed to cover the overall gist.....

1) The flat breads are $9 bucks and incredibly small. Not a great value.

2) The beer list is okay - they do have some craft (like Fresh Squeezed from Deschutes), but mainly the tap list is focused on beers like PBR.

3) The cocktails are a good value at $9. They dont skimp on the alcohol and use fresh ingredients.

4) If you play skeeball and score 650 points, you get a free beer. I scored 650 points twice, so the night went downhill quickly!

5) The vibe is mysterious, in a good way.

6) Friendly service.

I dont know if I would be back in Phoenix again (it was 110+ degrees), but if I do, ill come right back to Valley!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots. 

I come here all the time with buddy's to just hang out and it is also a cool concert venue. 

I read a review that knocked this place because of their difficulty of finding it...Thats really lame man. 

If you can't find this place, maybe you aren't cool enough to get in...just kidding!

Great food, drinks, and vibes.

{"text":"Went there on a Sunday night, live Jazz playing in one section of the bar. We had some spicy  flat bread that was pretty good, the drinks and the ambience made for a great evening. The stairs that lead down to underground was very cool, felt like I was in Chicago heading down to a smoke filled blues bar this was a fun filled evening, I recommend Valley Bar highly the ambience and the staff made for a fantastic  evening."}
{"text":"Pretty cool dive bar. They've got pool tables, shuffle board, darts, and live bands. Don't let the fact that you have to walk down a dark alley to get there or go down a flight of stairs to get down to there basement level scare you off. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Discovered this sweet spot last year when I was in town for work. My coworkers and I came back this past weekend and oh my, this place did not disappoint. We discovered their hidden room! Hidden badass room! We spent an hour and a half in the hidden room with our tall boys and Cards Against Humanity. This spot deserves a 5 star. Good drinks, fun games, and good vibrations. This, by far, is my favorite spot in Phoenix. Sweet sweet times!"}
{"text":"Typically when I go underground, I feel really claustrophobic. I think that goes for anyone. Like what if the ground falls in? You're done mate. But Valley Bar is able to do something extremely rare - it's able to not only inhibit that reaction, but also make me forget that the rest of the world is above me. 

Valley Bar really isn't my scene, but I gotta put on my 2014 Sochi Olympics hat of impartiality. When I went there, the dance floor was open, and the video of a concert from either the late 90's or early 2000's was on. I am not against recorded concerts, but it was one of those musical renditions where one guy on the dance floor wears a fedora and thinks he was last years champ on Dancing With the Stars - but without a partner.

But I mean...it was good. It all fit together somehow. Kinda how a Rubix Cube, even when it isn't figured out, still has it's own unique beauty. The drinks are reasonably priced and the crowd is on the younger side. So if that's your scene, then it's all laid out in front of you on a silver platter.

The place also has a few pool tables and other games for entertainment, but they are typically being used. So if an opening appears, jump in quicker than you're remote can change the channel. 

Like I said, it isn't really my cup of tea, but whenever I go I am with some friends and I consistently have a good time. If you go you will have a good time and will most likely be able to find something good in it. If you don't like it when you go, remember this: just because you don't like Apple Pie, that doesn't mean it's inherently bad, it just means your tastes are different and that's alright. And if someone does like Apple Pie, that's alright too."}
{"text":"This place should be in a Portlandia sketch (in a good way). You have to go down a sketchy alley into an unmarked door down into a basement, which is hilarious and apropos to the whole vibe. You feel transported to a grandma's basement circa 1970 - complete with weird thrift store wall decor and photos of anonymous children. 

Drinks were surprisingly cheap for downtown hipster bars ($5-6 for beers and well drinks). The house cocktails have great names (e.g. Janet Napolitini) and are creative with ingredients for some old stand by cocktails, kicking up up flavor a notch. These run around $8. 

Food is supplied by Shortleash Hot Dogs, which is a plus. I had fried pickles, which were delicious, though I wish they were dill, not sweet. 

The bar was out of control packed by 10 PM and you have to throw elbows to claim your space in line. I appreciate that there is a full bar with domestic, foreign, local and micro brew options. You want nasty old bud light? They got it. You want some over hoppy IPA from a microbew that you'll pretend to like to impress your friends? They got it."}
