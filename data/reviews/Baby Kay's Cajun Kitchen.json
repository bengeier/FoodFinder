{"text":"This is the best Cajun food in Phoenix. Best Etufee ever. Best wings called Lu Lu Wings.  Great Happy Hour.  Have been eating there for years. Yum"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic and plentiful food served here...Saturday date night a real hit had red beans and rice with sausage and date had jambalaya with chicken and sausage...appetizer bbq shrimp and hush puppies all great. 
Music great set mood will be back again on date night. A real winner!"}
{"text":"Yeah buddy! Just had Lulu wings and chicken and sausage gumbo with garlic bread for lunch. SO GOOD. THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"The food was great. I had shrimp PO-boy. My hubby had the red beans and rice. There was an old man singing that was annoying. Who Dat!  Go Saints."}
{"text":"Whoa. Lulu's Sweet And Spicy Tabasco Glazed Wings are the best wings I have ever eaten. They are crispy, delicious and best of all, hot! Small beer selection on tap, but it just so happens that the beers they do have (Four Peak's Kiltlifter and San Tan's Devil's Ale to name a few) are my favorites! Soon I'll try more things on the menu, but the wings are a great reason to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Good service, good people but, my jumbylia was seasoned with green peppers. I have never had jumbylia seasoned with green peppers. Red peppers are king in cajun food. Don't get me wrong, it was \"ok\"  but, not like that made by my grandma or my family (from Louisiana).
I will give them another try. There are not enough cajun food places in AZ."}
{"text":"One of the first pregnancy cravings I have had was Cajun food.  I found this place online and had to give it a try.  Great food,  great staff.  I was so impressed by thier food we will be going back.  I had the crawfish etouffee and it was truly amazing!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back for more! We decided to try a few things: bbq shrimp on happy hour, which has a spicy Worcestershire sauce, seafood gumbo, alligator and clam basket, and the vegetable ettoufee. The ettoufee was creamy without being too rich. Perfectly spiced and veggies were not overcooked.
The seafood gumbo was light on spices, which let the natural sweetness of the seafood come thru. We also had hushpuppies which came with a creamy horseradish sauce. Again, not too spicy which allows the flavors to come together.
I really loved everything. The dirty rice was salted just enough. We didn't want to give up the plate with the bbq sauce, we were dipping our bread in it. So good! I was very impressed with the alligator. I haven't had any this good for 15+ years. Cooked perfectly, using tender pieces of meat and a delicate batter.  Lastly, the olive cole slaw. They really put extra love into the dishes. You can tell when you taste the food. 
Waitress provided excellent service and I would recommend this place 100%. I know I'll be back. Try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Oh, Baby Kay's. It's been a long time since I've dined here. The etoufee has always been a personal favorite (crawfish, especially but the shrimp is also great) and that wonderful, slightly spicy thick blonde roux is where it's at! The service was very good.  My quibble is that the food is rather expensive ($19 for the crawfish etoufee?!?) Overall, good food with good service but unnecessarily pricey."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of southern food my husband always was, but now I absolutely love it! This place is worth the drive from all over Arizona we drive from Goodyear to Mesa. Fried Catfish and fries is so delicious! Husband loves the Combination plate of gumbo, etouffee and jambalaya. If your in town and want a memorable experience you have to come here worth every penny. Wish they had more locations throughout the valley maybe one day."}
{"text":"Impressed with the staff and the food.  Not fancy, but clean and neat.  Friendly staff and great service.  I had seafood basket with catfish, oysters and shrimp.  Cooked just right with reasonable price.  My wife loved the jambalaya so much, she almost ordered one to go.  All good, no complaints, but we just left before the monsoon blew over the tree in the parking lot.  Might be our lucky spot."}
{"text":"I simply will never compare Cajun/Creole-inspired restaurants outside of Southern Louisiana to the real deal. It's just one of those things you don't do. That being said, I am a HUGE fan of Baby Kay's. It's probably my first or second choice restaurant in the Valley of the Sun...of any variety of cuisine!

This casual joint first endeared itself to me by stocking a wonderous libation I feared was lost forever: Dixie Blackened Voodoo. I can't think of a better pairing of beer with food than a Voodoo and some ass-kickin' gumbo. Or any of your favorite SOLA entrees, for that matter. They have an ample selection of brews, as well.

With talk of delicious beers aside, the food here can hold its own in the Flavor Arena. I usually always get the crab cakes to start despite their $12 tag...they're undeniably worth it. You can't go wrong with the gumbo (try the duck & andouille combo, BOH!) or the other Cajun mainstays, etouffee, jambalaya, etc. Even the garlic bread that accompanies many of their hors d'oevres and entrees has a memorable quality to its flavor. 

Despite absolutely loving this place, I had to only give it 4 stars because I believe the menu to be limited. I wasn't crazy about the po'boys either...but then again I rarely am (blasphemy?). Also, there's no entree I've had there that's blown me away, yet it's all extremely flavorful and brings back some pleasant memories. Lastly, I'll add that of all the times I've eaten here, I've yet to try any of their desserts! Wonder why that is? heeh

Occasionally, they'll have a guitarist or musician of some sort jammin' away inside. The patio is great to sit and enjoy your meal, during the colder months, clearly. There are an interesting mix of people in that area and I've become involved in some really thoughtful conversations in the moments after I've stuffed my face full of goodness.

I've recently moved to the Loma Linda neighborhood in Phoenix, which is conveniently a few blocks away, so I'm sure y'all will see me at Baby Kay's with a Voodoo in my hand and a grin on my face!"}
{"text":"First time here and we enjoyed it. Our waitress was very friendly and helped us newbies thru the menu. We both had the combination basket, one with catfish and shrimp, and the other with catfish, shrimp, and oysters. My favorite was the shrimp and melt-in-your mouth oysters.  We both added a dinner salad; the ranch dressing was delicious. The gentleman playing guitar was wonderful and set the mood beautifully. Will definitely add this to our dinner out rotation."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, crab cakes, fried catfish the best I have had.  Sampler platter was amazing and good portion.  Very friendly staff.  Definitely in our rotation of places to eat."}
{"text":"They have the best cat fish I have ever had (in phoenix area)! 
The Crawfish etoffe was not as amazing but wasn't bad either. 
My friend ordered the special of the day, \"Smothered Pork Chop,\" and couldn't be happier with his dinner! The portion was really good, and the fruit salad slightly warmed/sauteed with Bourbon gave fruit salad a new sensation. 
I can't wait to visit this place again soon!"}
{"text":"We had been big fans when it was at the Biltmore.  We were so disappointed this time. It was not busy when we came in.  The food was okay not like we have had in the past. I ordered a salad with the apricot habanero dressing. It was not a dressing but a jam. You could not pour it. My husband used it as a spread for his bread.  My daughter had crab cakes, which were greasy and no flavor.  
The serve was also just okay.  The server who brought our dinner asked if we received every thing as she walked away. My daughter had not received her whole meal. We had to flag her down. She said she would check on it and walked over to another table and never did check. Finally another person brought her meal. 
My husband and I go to  New Orleans annually and this was not a Orleans experience in food or serve."}
{"text":"I love this place! The crawfish etouffee is to die for, but really everything is great. My only complaint is that I don't live closer!"}
{"text":"Brought a friend from Louisiana here.  She says that the crawfish etouffee here is the best she's had outside of Louisiana!"}
{"text":"This place is aweaome!  You have to have some of their Crawfish ettouffe. It is one of the best tasting meals I've ever had. The place isn't cheap but is well worth it."}
{"text":"This is the best Cajun Food in Arizona.  While I would agree with other reviewers that the whole menu is top notch, I will add that the Crawfish Etouffee is shockingly authentic.  Even in New Orleans you will be hard pressed to find better Etouffee and Baby Kay's would impress any Yat.  I will be interested to see what the new location looks like when all the work is complete, but even the current setup still has a real New Orleans vibe.

Recommendation: Visit at happy hour.  I have eaten at Baby Kay's for years and always eat off the dinner or po'boy menu, but happy hour is quite good.  The wings/etoufee/gumbo/sliders are perfect to go with your drinks and the portions are quite generous.  This is a great way to get a taste of NOLA."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with superb service and something a little unique in the Valley - translating a difficult, spicey, gamey style of cuisine into food that everyone will appreciate. You really can't go wrong on the menu - the gumbos are wonderful and the jambalaya spicey and delicious. Try the pasta with the cajun cream sauce, and of course their pulled pork is a classic favorite among their customers. 

Full bar; I suggest a tropically inspired drink like a painkiller. Nice wine menu that is very affordable, but also qute good, with lots of smart choices a little off the beaten path. They feature daily specials that are fancied by their regulars and folks come fraom all over across the Valley to get there - Chandler, Surprise, even out of town. Charles Barkley gave them a wonderful review at the half-time of a superbowl. 

Simply the best."}
{"text":"Looking for Cajun? Look no further. My favorites are the etufee and gumbo. I stopped in on a Friday night and had the pork chop special, it had to be the biggest and most tender chop I've had! For those of you looking for a classic dirty rice they took me back to a LA coonass swap party. The live guitar sole was a great addition for back ground music."}
{"text":"Tonight we visited Baby Kay's in Mesa, and took friends from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, (a true Cajun test). We shared a couple of real Cajun appetizers and four entrees and our Cajun friends said it was as good as you would get down on the bayou. An incredible experience that I would highly recommend. Great food, atmosphere and service by very friendly people. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Total meh fest. I went with a group of 10 or so and it took an hour for our food to come. Being someone that doesn't care for spicy food, the sandwich I got was quite boring. Some people that like Cajun enjoy this place though."}
{"text":"I won't go on and on about Baby Kays, but instead, direct you to consider other reviews.  Remember that everyone's tastes are different and many will compare to food they ate elsewhere, especially NOLA.  The truth is, even in Louisiana, you'll find an étouffée that is outstanding, and half a block away...an étouffée that doesn't compare.  With that said, Baby Kay's is the best Cajun food in Phoenix.  Period.  Many thanks to Kay (Mrs. R.) for sharing her recipes and delighting my taste buds."}
{"text":"Been a Baby Kays fan since the first one on Shoeman Lane in Snottsdale.  Any review less than 4 stars is either a competitor or needs to put down the pipe.

Green olive slaw is simply fantastic.  Love the Cajun Combination and recommend it for newbies.  Their Friday night Smothered Southern Pork Chops have a huge fan base.  But I'll always be a sucker for the crawfish étouffée.....sprinkled with a little extra cayenne.

Thanks to Kay for bringing her authentic recipes from Louisiana, and to the girls that are carrying on the legacy of great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for Cajun. BBQ shrimp is my favorite. Try the smothered pork chop you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Good God almighty!! Look I've had a lot of catfish in my time, but this is hands dooowwwwnnnn the best I've ever had. Then, then there's the bread pudding.....I mean this is a religious experience. Man if you're looking for REAL CAJUN down home cooking you need to get to this place now. Hey QUIT reading this and go man go."}
{"text":"Stopped here tonight for the first time, and was blown away by the catfish dinner with crawfish sauce. Do yourself a favor and try this, you will love it!"}
{"text":"The sampler platter was good.  The gumbo needs some work.  Enjoyed the ambience and the laid back scenery.  Good place to chill with your significant other."}
{"text":"Finally tried Baby Kay's and I'm in love! The chicken and andouille sausage gumbo was great! Comparable to gumbo that I've had in actual New Orleans! Hush puppies were yummy too, especially dipped in the remoulade sauce! The garlic bread gives your tastebuds a nice break from the spice of the gumbo and the Cajun vinaigrette salad dressing is to die! Can't wait to go back and try more things!"}
{"text":"This place has atmosphere, good food, and a great vibe. My only dislike was the drink, it tasted like water and a margarita with Grand Marnier should be really good. Everyone was super friendly though,  and the food was beyond my expectations!  This was my first visit, and I will definitely be back over and over again!  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Baby Kay's is the best Cajun food in Phoenix bar none I always order the appetizers and they are incredible plus happy hour starts at 2 o'clock in the afternoon"}
{"text":"There are not a lot of choices for Cajun food here in AZ, but it has been on my brain lately since it was just Mardi Gras, so I rounded up a group of friends to try it out on a Friday night.

The inside is pretty casual, which is nice, I don't always feel like dressing up on a Friday after work.  We arrived at 7 pm and there was no wait for a table, but the restaurant was pretty much full, which is always a good sign.

I had the Crawfish Etoufee and it was delicious!  It had lots of big chunks of crawfish and a nice punch of heat.  I ordered just the individual cup size and it was plenty of food, especially since they serve it with a basket of garlic bread.  

We also tried the hushpuppies, which I don't have much experience with, I guess they were good?  The spinach artichoke dip was mediocre, and it came out with a pile of store bought tortilla chips, but the menu stated that it came with garlic bread.  We asked our server and he told us that they had been serving it with chips lately, but that he would bring us some bread.  The bread was better with the dip, but the dip was still nothing special and I wouldn't order it again.

The service was fine, but the reason I had to knock this place down a star is because of the bathroom situation.  You literally have to walk into the kitchen to get to the bathroom!  You look to your right and you have the service counter where the food is waiting and then you look to your left and you are in the bathroom....it is so weird!  I was glad that I didn't have to use the bathroom until I was done eating!  

Bathroom situation aside, I will probably be back when the Cajun craving strikes again....hopefully I will forget about the bathrooms by then!"}
{"text":"This is the best Cajun food in the area. Catfish with craw fish sauce is not to be missed. Loved this place since they moved to the Baseline and Dobson location in Mesa.

Plenty of other choices on the menu to satisfy. 

Friendly staff and owners.

Reservations help on weekends. 

One note, can be loud on weekends with live entertainment."}
{"text":"Best Cajun food in the valley period!    The cajun combo is my meal of choice here - fantastic chicken and sausuge gumbo, crawfish etouffee, along with jambalaya how can you go wrong?  The seafood enchilada's are out of this world (usually served on Tuesday's).    One of my absolute favorite restaurants.   Great management and fantastic food!"}
{"text":"We had the most wonderful birthday dinner at Baby Kay's, 2051 S. Dobson in Mesa, AZ, tonight for my birthday. I'm adding photos of Norma's lagniappe salad (\"lagniappe\" is a New Orleans word for a little extra, in this case Cajun sausage as well as bacon and a multitude of other goodies in the salad. I had Cajun fried catfish with a crawfish etouffe sauce, plus garlic toast and a choice of potato salad, olive cole slaw, or a side salad. I got a free dessert, sweet potato pie, lighter than more traditionally seasoned pumpkin pie, and Norma had key lime pie. A musician playing a fiddle and then a guitar to taped music was a delightful accompaniment, his New Orleans style songs adding so much to the background."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Service was great. My server was very attentive and very personable. The seafood gumbo was excellent. But . . . The catfish platter was the big disappointment. It was more like soggy ( or gummy) fish sticks. Not much fish inside a soggy breading. It was almost like the oil wasn't hot enough to crisp up the coating. And the French fries were obviously not fresh potatoes and appeared to have been under a warmer for awhile."}
{"text":"It had been ages since I had been to Baby Kay's...it's kinda just off the beaten path that I forget about it.....what a mistake. After wandering back a month ago my better half and I have made it our Monday spot along with a few other trips in between. Mondays are beer battered shrimp with dirty rice a a wonderful crawfish sauce that rocks my world (shrimp are big and sweet and you get 8 which trust me makes for ALOT of food). My hubby loves the chicken and sausage gumbo...so much so that we get an extra for lunch the next day. All of the food has a wonderful spicy kick that is seriously addictive and the patio is great for this time of year. Of course we sit at the bar where Jimmy takes great care of us. Noelle whom some of you may remember from her Ticoz days works the luch crowd. So if you haven't checked it out its worth the trip and a Happy Hour cocktail with Jimmy."}
{"text":"Always great food!  Definitely a place to come when you need something beyond the ordinary fare you'll find at a local bar.  The hush puppies are great and the catfish out of this world.  I echo another reviewers comments and wish they would add beignets - that would be the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"I ordered the crawfish etoufee and seafood gumbo and it came with garlic bread.  The seafood gumbo was extremely spicy, it was to the point where my nose almost started running. The etoufee and garlic bread was on point tho."}
{"text":"Drove by and saw the sign on the building and couldn't be happier to have this Authentic Cajun restaurant in my neighborhood after hearing it had closed in Phoenix.  We stopped for Lunch and had the Baby Kay's combo which was totally awesome nice and spicy.  Plus the Catfish dinner with Crawfish sauce which was melt in your mouth delicious.  If your an diehard Cajun cooking lover than this place is for you.  Super friendly staff told us about there plan to take over the next door store as well and a patio.   Nice to have another awesome food place in the area and nice to be the first on here to highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Catfish Po'boy and crawfish etoufee lunch combo were outstanding!  We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"When I stopped in I had the oyster PoBoy and a side of Gumbo. They were solid offerings. Despite the lack of other Cajun options in the Phoenix area, I'm pretty picky with my Cajun food because my family is from Louisiana. I spent a lot of time in south Louisiana, and Baby Kay's holds up pretty well."}
{"text":"My BBQ shrimp was swimmimg in worsteshire sauce and was almost too salty to eat.  The quality of the food/recipes was not what I expected for cajun seafood.  I wanted to like this place as I live in DR, but I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with my boyfriend. We are both cajun food fans. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip with crab. I ordered jambalaya, and he ordered the combination plate. They were all edible but not very pleasing to the palate. The  staff was nice, but the main entries took almost an hour to come out. It was pretty disappointing. I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"I'M UPSET! Baby Kay's: WHERE do you get off serving gumbo that damn good?? How dare you. And the green olive cole slaw? You're just showing off. And then you have the nerve to play classic New Orleans music while I stuff my face, coming up for air strictly for survival purposes.

And the bread pudding with the whiskey sauce?? My granny made bread pudding that I thought was the best in the world. Now I'm mad as hell at her. And she can't even defend herself, because she's dead.

My whole world is shaken right now. In the best way possible. Kudos, Baby Kay. I love you."}
{"text":"Great first visit!  Great customer service, live music, and food!  We were given samples for our first visit.  The gumbo is awesome!  Lulus wings were great!  We will definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Best food ever!   The fried chicken on Thursday nights is amazing.  The jambalaya incredible.  The pork chop falls right off the bone.  The andouille sausage is amazing.  Atmosphere is AWESOME.  Live jazz blues music on Fridays and Saturdays. The staff always friendly and glad to see you."}
{"text":"OK, now i'm sure for those who've never lived in the south, maybe you like Baby Kays. I had a friend from college in town and we were both craving crawfish like the good little southern girls we've become (we lived in New Orleans for four years). 

We got to the restaurant and it reminded me of Acme Oyster House. I thought it a good sign. We were seating outside and saw the boilers! We almost screamed we were so excited. We ordered two Abitas (mmmmmm!) but they were tapped out (dirty bitches!) so we had bloody marys instead. The bloody marys needed major tweakage; we added tabasco, pepper, and more pepper! Already, kind of a disappointment. 

All around us, people were ordering the crawfish and we couldn't wait for it. We got the \"5 pound\" special which came with two pieces of corn, no potatoes, sausage (which my friend was craving!), or garlic (WTF?). The crawfish were decent size but the taste was awful! I think they only spiced it with tabasco sauce! our lips were burning and not in that delicious crab boil way. I mean, i know what crawfish tastes like and this was an amateur attempt. They didn't even use the proper spices or anything. 

For $29.50, that's ridiculous. And for those of us that know what crawfish are supposed to cost, i'm embarrassed to have even paid over $10.

If you go, don't get the crawfish...it's a rip off. Two stars for the service."}
{"text":"Loved the wings here and the etouffe was wonderful. Service was good and the orders arrived in good time. First time here and now it will become one of my favorites. Crab cakes were also good and the hush puppies too. Red beans and rice were also enjoyed by all who ordered them. Blues music played by a guitar soloist Thursday Friday and Saturday nights"}
{"text":"This place is just awesome. Come in for Louisiana beers I haven't seen anyplace else in town (namely Dixie), their combination platters never disappoint. Save room for their bread pudding!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, ambience was nice and the servers were quick to serve.  They even had a guy playing guitar and violin, but at a quiet level (so you can converse).  I liked that they have a bunch of the dishes as small happy hour offerings.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love Cajun/Creole food - good, bad or indifferent.  I first became acquainted with it when I was in the service in eastern Texas in Galveston.  Coming from Washington State, it was a  brand new experience for me - the flavors were wild and exotic.  And since we had nothing like it in Washington, I taught myself to cook it - gumbo, jambalaya, barbecued shrimp, etouffee,  red beans and rice - I loved it all.  I bought every cookbook available, and this was prior to Paul Prudhomme, Emeril, and Justin Wilson.  My children grew up eating Cajun, and even now they ask me to cook it for them when they come home.

So I had a craving for Cajun food, and headed off to Baby Kay's.  I finally found it tucked away in a mall on Camelback.  The inside is inviting, and there is a patio adjacent to it.  When I came in there was an old man playing blues at the front entrance, so I knew it was the right spot.  

I sat at the bar and sampled their shrimp etoufee, chicken and sausage gumbo, and jambalaya.   Of course, I had to sample the Turbo Dog beer.  Sad to say, the beer was the best part of the whole meal.

I was disappointed in the flavors of the food.  It seemed that they had toned the taste down, so as  to appease the general public. Cajun and Creole  food is simple, yet can be made quite complex with the spices added - and I don't mean just Tabasco Sauce.

I have to give them credit - the food was obviously prepared correctly - the gumbo was made with a roux, the jambalaya was not swimming in  tomato sauce.  I loved the etouffee - if I had just had that and the Turbo Dog beer, I would have been satisfied.

So I will go back - but only if I have a craving for Cajun/Creole food - and only if I can't find any place better."}
{"text":"Serviceable, but not memorable cajun food.  The service was OK.  Atmosphere is OK if a little cheesy.  I doubt if the people on here who are saying the food is fantastic have ever been to Louisiana.  They do a crayfish boil on Wednesdays that I was excited about but then found out that it's $35, which is pretty ridiculous (It's not all you can eat).  If I'm going to spend that kind of money on an entree it's going to be at someplace nice.  I could go down to the local Chinese buffet and eat crayfish till I burst for about $7.  If you live in the area and are craving Cajun by all means you should eat here, it's not bad.  But I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"We have been going to Baby Kay's for over 25 years in its different locations.  So, when we saw that they had opened up at Dobson and Baseline in Mesa, we got very excited.  
Well, guess what.  We were not disappointed.  Service was wonderful.  Owners there to greet and say thanks for coming.  Same people from 20th street and Camelback.
AND the food was wonderful, still.  The GUMBO is to die for.  I am a fairly rough critic of food at restaurants and this is strictly first class.  
Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a early dinner. The service was good. Unlike other places, if a server was walking by and saw that you needed something, they took care of you even if it wasn't their table. Top notch.

The food was mediocre. I've spent a lot of time in New Orleans and am very familiar with Creole cooking. I spent a week there in 2011 and had the opportunity to spend some time cooking with several of the local chefs. Baby Kay's red beans and rice is made with a common dark red kidney bean. While this bean has its uses, it is not the correct bean for red beans and rice. The correct bean is less common, smaller, lighter in color and makes a much creamier dish. It would be like tying to make RB&R with a pinto bean, It's just not the correct flavor or texture. The bean used in Creole country is Camellia brand. While even the Camellia brand calls itself a \"red kidney bean\" it is the correct bean and very different from a dark kidney bean. I know that's a lot about beans, but this is an important distinction. Baby Kay's RB&R were too thick and not the right texture. Also, the rice was overcooked and mushy. It seemed like they were trying to hide it under the beans. 

The seafood gumbo was just meh. It didn't have the richness you expect in a gumbo. It seems like they don't start their gumbo with a roux leading to a creole sauce. It was just a thin soup. Not the correct texture or flavor. Other than three shrimp which were properly cooked, but had no flavor, there were crayfish. Regarding the shrimp you really have to salt them heavily. These shrimp lacked seasoning. The crayfish were previously frozen and had a mushy texture. All in all not great. If a Cajun place can't get RB&R and gumbo right, there is no reason to try any of their other dishes.

One last thing, if you want to taste proper RB&R, as strange as it sounds, head to Popeye's chicken. They are hands down the best RB&R in the city and win \"best of\" awards every year in New Orleans."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday! The food was really really good! Loved the ambiance of the restaurant it had the New Orleans vibe! I had the Lulus wings and the po boy and gumbo soooo yummy!!!!! We ordered the bread pudding it was okay I think the whiskey sauce was too strong for me personally. Other than that highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have specials everyday of the week my favorites are Monday Beer Battered Fried Shrimp special is spectacular. The dirty rice and craw fish sauce that accompany it are very tasty. I've also tried the Thursday Fried Chicken special and it's also very good. Overall, the quality of the food is excellent and the spices and flavors are delightful."}
{"text":"I'm really hoping it was just an off night, but somehow, I doubt it. The service was horrible. We asked for sweetener with our iced tea, and the server forgot to bring it. We didn't get the sweetener until we asked her again when she delivered our appetizer sampler. The appetizer was nothing special: french fries, fried shrimp, fried catfish, fried oysters, jalapeno poppers, and hushpuppies. Everything was just ok, except for the inedibly slimy, weird-tasting oysters. Those were gross. Their \"remoulade\" sauce just tasted like straight-up horseradish and mayo. Not good. 

On to the entrees... We waited about 45 minutes for our entrees after we were served our appetizer. My partner ordered the Baby Kay's combo of red beans and rice and chicken and andouille sausage gumbo. Her beans and rice were ok, but the gumbo was pretty bland and lukewarm. When the server delivered the food, she said she'd be right back with the garlic bread that was supposed to come with the combo, but she never came back. I ordered the half catfish po'boy and cup of seafood gumbo. My gumbo was cold and really bland. I really thought they'd at least get the gumbo right. The po'boy wasn't anything special. It was really dry and flavorless. 

If our server had checked on us, we'd have complained about the cold gumbo, but she didn't even return with the garlic bread she promised. We even had to ask the busser for our check. 

Overall, bad service and bland food. Cajun food is supposed to have tons of flavor, but we didn't find that in anything we ordered. We definitely won't be back. It was not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Bad Ass Cajun.  
Came in on a Friday and sat at the bar to get some Cajun fare.  I got the seafood gumbo and the half shrimp Po Boy.  Both were delish! Shrimp in both dishes was plump, juicy and that special crunchy fresh you dream of at night.  Sitting down at the bar, I talked to the tender and the guests.  Everybody was friendly and the tender even was calling me by name when I left.  I explained how much I liked the gumbo and she let me try the sausage and chicken gumbo on the house and it too was also a tasty classic gumbo delight.
All in all this was a down home friendly, classically Cajun experience that is now one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Cool atmosphere. Great service. I'm really glad it was recommended to us. My new favorite in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I started with hush puppies ($2.00 1/2 basket) and came with a creamy horseradish sauce and a smoky and slightly sweet BBQ dipping sauce. Both were tasty.

Next was a bowl of seafood Gumbo ($15.75) that came with a side of green olive slaw and garlic bread. The gumbo was yummo. It was a bit spicy, however, I added some Louisiana Gold hot sauce to my taste.

Water and a bottle of  Turbodog beer to wash it sown.

.Delizioso!"}
{"text":"Food was good and the people were friendly.  Good prices on food and the server was very helpful since this was the first time there.  Appetizer sampler platter was fine but nothing special and the gumbo was very good."}
{"text":"i'm a former new orleanian, so i came in to this place a skeptic.

the red beans and rice were outstanding. i wouldn't give it a 100%, but a solid 90. I'd be happier if there were cornbread and if they had crystal hot sauce. also, better rice to bean to sausage ratio (currently needs more rice and sausage, slightly less bean).

i also had the boudin balls. they were good in and of themselves, but they were served with garlic bread (i don't think i was ever served garlic bread in a cajun restaurant during my years in nola) and some weird marmalade. i still have no idea what that marmalade was or why it was there, but again, the boudin itself was great.

the hush puppies were also really good. 

the portions were giant, and i'd definitely go back time and time again."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week and I was uber excited to see a Cajun restaurant participating:) It wasn't a busy night yet we waited I felt a few long minutes for basic initial service (if lady says ill give u a min she means minutes as in plural as in more than a few lol)....the crawfish etouffee was delish as well as the Cajun shrimp cocktail, key lime pie, and bread pudding.  Not impressed with the dry jambalaya, crab cakes and sea food gumbo:(  If I'm in the area I might try again but not a place I would go out the way for.  My anticipation was more exciting than actual experience....it happens :)"}
{"text":"I have only been to 3 other Cajun restaurants. I had the Cajun Combo and loved it. The crawfish ettouffe was very good, as were the other dishes. The garlic bread that comes with it is the best. It is toasted just right and if you go with friends order a side. This food is hot and I left the place sweating. I look forward to coming back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"What a great little place. The food and atmosphere were awesome (really enjoyed the music, made me feel like we were in New Orleans, or watching one of my favorite shows...miss you Treme). Our waiter was great and the serving portions were just right (the chicken and sausage gumbo was soooo tasty, and really digged the homemade chips). The only reason I did not give 5-stars is that I felt it was just a wee-bit pricy for lunch (but you will have to forgive me, as I am a bit of a bargain hunter).  We enjoyed our visit when they were located in Phoenix, and were very pleased to see that they relocated closer to home (our home of course). I am looking forward to their future expansion, which should allow for more seating as well as a more attractive bar area. (also thank you so much for cleansing my mind and body of our earlier horrible Coco's experience)."}
{"text":"Yummy etoufee and gumbo! I'm in love with how delicious and reasonable the food is. Awesome live entertainment & specials. The service and atmosphere are very friendly and inviting. My kids even love it here...we'll be back...again and again."}
{"text":"this place is tucked away in the town and country shopping center...the food is authentic, the crawfish etoufee is to die for, and it goes great with an order of their homemade chips...haven't tried much on the menu besides that except for the shrimp remoulade, which was underwhelming. cocktails are on the sugary side, but they have a decent wine selection...price is reasonable, service sometimes a little slower than you might like but always friendly..."}
{"text":"We didn't even know this place existed (in Mesa) until a few weeks ago but we tried some take-out today and were happy we did.  My wife, the sea food eater, LOVED the crab cakes and we both shared and enjoyed the red beans & rice, jambalaya, pulled pork sliders and original chicken wings.  The wings were some of the best we've ever had anywhere!  Also tried the cup of gumbo, dirty rice and potato salad, all of which were very good.  A really nice extra was the garlic bread that came with our food - absolutely fantastic!  Since there are really no other authentic cajun places around, we'll be going back to Baby Kay's...often!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Cajun food in Arizona had there crawfish gumbo and lulus wings 
We will for sure be back 

We ended it with pecan pie and yummy in my tummy"}
{"text":"I must say I love this place. My family is originally from Mississippi and Alabama The first time i went was with my dad. but I have been there many times thereafter.  I love the location even thoe its a bit far from me. I feel it is well worth the drive. I stop by  by whenever i can my favorites are the BBQ  shrimp it has a sweet spicy sauce for the shrimp which is off set perfectly by the rice. I also love the oyster and shrimp po' boys they even let me do half and half one half of the po' boy oyster and the other half shrimp. I can never seem to make it to there desserts because i always get full first. But i have never been disappointed leaving Baby Kays.  There is always a good vibe there they have live music on the weekend . I think it can be a family spot or even a wonderful date spot either way just walking in gives me good vibes and makes me happy. I love the food, people,vibes, and even the shopping plaza its located it. I consider it to be a hidden gem of the desert."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this restaurant is fabulous, we absolutely loved the guitar player,  and his singing! The food was less impressive but interesting nonetheless. It's pretty good for what you can find in Arizona. I would definitely check out this restaurant, it's really fun and locally owned and operated"}
{"text":"This restaurant does a good job of representing Cajun food from Louisiana.    The portions were bigger than we had seen in the various photos on Yelp.   There were seven of us and we had a variety of dishes.   With the most noteworthy one being the chicken and Andouille sausage.   Three of us had a cup of this gumbo and it was delicious.

The crawfish etouffee was delicious and plentiful.   In fact, it was so filling that I didn't have enough room to finish the seafood gumbo.   The garlic bread is a nice addition to the meal and toned down some of the spiciness.    All of us agreed that the food was unique and good and that we would all return for another experience to sample to more of the menu items."}
{"text":"Starters we ordered the Lulu Wings with our drinks. Great choice! So delicious with their honey hot sauce. It is unusual for both my boyfriend and I to enjoy the same spice level, but these wings did it! He all but licked the plate. 
I had the Georgia Peach cocktail. Very sweet but very delicious. Had two, and could not drive home. They do not skimp on the pour. 
For dinner I ordered the Crawfish Étouffée with green olive coleslaw. I not a big green olive fan, but I heard it was one of their best sides. So for me to say it was good, even though I didn't finish it, is saying something. I also ordered it because the boy LOVES green olives. He devoured  what I didn't eat. 
The Étouffée was my first and it was so good; spicy but I couldn't stop eating. Definitely had leftovers wit their portions. 

The boy ordered the po'boy combo: Shredded pork po'boy with the duck & andouille gumbo. I had a bit of both, so delicious. He loved Rémoulade. I believe it is horseradish.

I wouldn't call this place a hole in the wall, but it is not fine dinning. If you are only into that sort of putting, this place is not for you. But if you like great food and a fun atmosphere, this is a great place to try.
 I did give them a 4 because it took a while for anybody to get to us to order and even though we ordered our starter and our mains separately, they came out on top of one another. It made things super crowded at our table and it meant our mains were cooling off. The wait staff did pack up my leftovers for me. So outside of those two minor blips, their staff was super attentive."}
{"text":"Love it!  Fridays entree is pork chops- so amazing!  craw fish etoueffee- wow!"}
{"text":"I was shocked .. Heard great things about this place... Went there to celebrate Fat Tuesday expecting great food and I was really disappointed... Do not get the crab cakes... Fishy and full of filler.. Shrimp are not much better... Gumbo is u flavorful...Service was sooo slow, they were busy but over an hour for food? And no apology, my daughters grilled cheese was cold and no longer melted."}

BACKGROUND
---------------------
I'd been in New Orleans for 5 days back in October, eating some of the most tasty food ever. Spicy and full of flavor, I just couldn't get enough of what the French Quarter, Marigny, and the Garden District had to offer. And the beignets. Oh, those fickin' beignets.  I'm salivating right now just thinking about them.

And so, when the opportunity arose not too long ago to dine at Baby Kay's in the awesome and happening Town & Country shopping center, I jumped right on it, hanging out with a fellow Yelper on the patio with the other office-type folk.

FOOD
---------
Over hushpuppies, gumbo, and etoufee, I sat there pondering about what I was eating. It had been quite a while since I'd last eaten here, but everything seemed oddly familiar in that nothing really stood out for me. I then said to my friend, \"Huh. Baby Kay's grub is ok. Not great Cajun, not bad Cajun.  Just not a whole lot for the price, though. If I wrote a Yelp review on it, I'd give it 3 stars.\"

And so today I decided to finally do just that.

Except when I logged into Yelp I found out I had already reviewed this place.

And had already given it three stars.

So go figure. At least they're consistent.

3 stars (again)."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food, We've ate at the one that use to be on Camelback and it was better. Our waiter/bartender spilled a glass of Ice tea all over me and I was not offered or given any discount for my meal. It was very uncomfortable eat with wet clothes on. Very unhappy and will not recommend this place. :("}
{"text":"Holy creoley in your mouth  Their duck and andouille sausage is a delicious starter to get your palate all wet and excited. Then kick off the fireworks with the catfish dish covered in crawfish etouffee  All while being serenaded by the sexiest of blues musicians. If you can't tell, I'm in love."}
{"text":"UPDATE!! - Baby Kays is closing at their current location effective 8/31/13. Their A-HOLE landlord of 20 years did not even give them a chance to renew their lease. Instead the landlord just signed with a different restaurant and gave my beloved 60 days notice to vacate!

Anyway, the new location will open at the old Richardson's location on 16th Street and Bethany sometime in November. You can follow their facebook page for updates or stop in and they will take down your email address and email you updates.

Enjoy. You betta go get some etouffee while you can!!!

Had it yet again today. As good as ever. YUM."}
{"text":"I've been back to Baby Kay's several times since my initial review and I have decided to upgrade my rating to 5 Star! I love everything I have ever been served there, and the catfish with crawfish sauce is to die for! I should've given them five stars to begin with!"}
{"text":"Great Cajun place! Everything was really good overall. Good amount of spice. Boudin balls were tasty. Jambalaya was good but rice was just a little too soft. Gumbo and etouffee were both very good. Cute interior and they have a bar too which I wasn't expecting. We will be back."}
{"text":"It's the real thing. I've been to N'awlins many, many times. This is what the food tastes like. Try the Cornish game hen- you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great place. Wonderful food and service. Tastes as good as the Gumbo Shop in the Big Easy. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My husband's family is from Louisiana. And he said this place reminds him of home...and that says a lot. We will definitely coming back, because I want to try everything on the menu. THIS IS A MUST COME....BAAAAABEEE KAYS KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DOING..."}
{"text":"Everything I had was delicious, the staff was all very friendly and atmosphere was really pleasant. The specials board was covered in delicious sounding meals, some for dinner, some lunch, some both. I tried the combo so I could get the biggest sampling possible on my first visit and couldn't have been happier. The jambalaya, chicken and sausage gumbo, coleslaw and bread were all really good and the crawfish étouffée was phenomenal. I sat inside but they have a patio with umbrellas that looked pretty appealing. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Good. Authentic. Kinda pricey, but only \"kinda\"
Good.... not many healthy options - but one prolly doesn't expect healthy with Canun"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my 6 year old on Friday, April 6.  I ordered the shrimp poboy and seafood gumbo.  Both were mediocre. Service was friendly but took a long time to get the food out and even longer to get the bill.  I had a local dines coupon so I thought I would try this place out.  My son ordered from the kids menu- chicken nugget with fries. The nugget were the dinosaur ones you buy at the store in the freezer bags and heat it up.  In my opinion, the quality of the kids menu/food should try to equal that of the adult.  If the kids menu is created to have one and serves frozen food then I could have fed my son at home.  Everything was mediocre.  I also ordered a togo 1/2 poboy and 1/2 gumbo combo for my husband.  He didn't think the food was that good either.  Even with the coupon,I spent out of pocket $25 on 2 adult lunch.  Pricey for mediocre food and service. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm here for happy hour prices can not be beat the shrimp cocktail is out of this world the cocktail sauce will make you sit up and take notice! Service was very lack luster the waitress was more interested in talking with men at the bar then seeing if I needed more ice tea..."}
{"text":"Love the Live Music!
Love the Atmosphere! 
Love how the soft drinks are served (in a carafe).
Love the ambiance!
Really liked the Crab Cake appetizer ... Really liked .. not loved.  I'm from Maryland so I'm a little biased 
LOVED the catfish dinner with crawfish sauce .. Man that was damn good!
Loved the side salad and ranch that accompanied my entrée.
LOVED the garlic bread that also accompanied my meal.

The portions are HUGE!  More than enough for dinner and leftovers.  I've been in Arizona for 4 years.  I love Cajun food.  I have no idea why it took me so long to try it.  One thing's for certain, it won't take me so long to go back.  

Exceptional service!  I noticed there were LOTS of regulars dining there.  Some of the guest knew the servers by name and vice versa.  That was nice to see. I don't know if they have live music every night but they do for sure on Saturdays.  I must return soon!"}
{"text":"Lately, I've been on the hunt for a good shrimp po boy. I'm not sure if this compulsion was spurred by homesickness for New Orleans, the food challenge show featuring 2 famous NOLA po boy joints, or both but I've it seems the last few weekends I've found myself dreaming of that crusty bread \"dressed\" with lettuce, tomato, and mayo, and golden deep fried gulf shrimp. I happened to notice Baby K's one day and decided to try it out. To be honest, I wasn't even really that hungry but I wanted the po boy and I didn't know when or if I'd have the opportunity to go back to Town and Country mall any time in the near future. The inside was empty but they have a French
Quarter-esque patio complete with wrought iron fence. The bf and I both ordered the half pb with a cup of gumbo. I'm a bit of a gumbo snob bc I feel I can make it better than any restaurant can but theirs was really good! They had 3 different kinds which was nice and it was seasoned perfectly. There wasn't a bite that didn't have meat in and the broth was just right. The shrimp on the pb was succulent and almost tasted as if it was battered in beignet mix as the fried was light and airy. I didn't indulge in any libations but they do have Abita and a few other New Orleans beer classics. If I find myself in the area again I'd probably go back but this time I'm ordering a whole po boy!"}
{"text":"Baby Kays and Pappadeaux's are the only real Cajun restaurants in the valley. All else I've tried including Cajun Seafood Corner, Voodoo Daddy's, and Ches Moneaux are posers only. They only WISH they served the quality Cajun cuisine that these restaurants serve day in and day out. My favorite item on the menu for Baby Kay's is the crawfish ettouffee. I've also had the red beans and rice. It is VERY GOOD. Couple the food with live entertainment on the weekend and you've got a recipe for a Cajun good time! Laissez Les Bon Temps Roullette!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places. First, Everything on the menu is to die for. I get my usual, chicken gumbo with a side of brocolli, we have recently been getting our son the catfish sticks, I am not a catfish person, but wow! I help him eat them, if he lets me. ;) I could go on and on about the other fantastic favorites, 
We get treated so special there which is really nice. It feels like home. And our sons favorite thing is Dino, the music man. He isn't always there, but you can catch him at lunch or in the evenings starting around 6. That's a nice deal considering most place don't start music till 8, that's our kids bedtime.
I highly recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"We received the friendliest, most attentive service here tonight. The server took time to answer questions about the menu and offered suggestions. This was one of those rare occasions where you're waited on and the server genuinely seems happy helping you. The Fetuccuni Alfredo with shrimp had some spice, but not too much for someone like myself who can't take a lot of it. I strongly dislike coleslaw but their olive version is great. It was pleasantly surprising and really is an interesting twist. The restaurant itself is clean, well maintained, and the decor is fitting."}
{"text":"My first time eating here was an awesome experience. Funny how dive restaurants are missed by many. This dive is a must visit! I had several item's. The boudin balls were reasons for me to visit in the first place but had samples of the chicken/sausage gumbo and jambalaya and had to get a full serving because it was delicious. Also,  giving samples adds a touch of service excellence. The red beans and rice was a hit. Really did not like the potato salad due to the dill but this may be a staple for some. I will be back to experience the live entertainment. Thanks"}
{"text":"So my wife has been bugging me to get takeout from this place for quite some time. I finally caved, and man am I glad I did. We each got the Baby Kay's Combination that came with Crawfish Etoufee, Chicken Jambalaya and Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. They each came with a side dish. I chose the green olive cole slaw, my wife opted for the side salad (booooo). We also threw on a basket of hush puppies.  The Etoufee was great, nice spice and a great velvety texture. The \"jambalaya\" wasn't what I had expected, it was more like dirty rice with sausage (no chicken or shrimp).  The Gumbo was pretty good, but I didn't eat much because I was so full. The hush puppies were okay, nothing to write home about.  We just purchased the 2010 Entertainment book, so we had buy one get one free. Total tab was around $22, money well spent. Am I hooked? no. Would I go back, yup if I was in the mood."}
{"text":"Baby Kay's has transformed the space previously occupied by Cajun Seafood Corner. Gone is the kitsch of 1980s New Orleans, to be pleasantly replaced with a more subtle and austere atmosphere reminscent of an underground jazz joint. The bar still features prominently at the front, but has a classy vibe. The restaurant has doubled it's space, adding enough tables to handle the Friday night crowd very well while leaving a good corner open for some live Jazz guitar. We started with a basket of hushpuppies served with ketchup and remoulade for dipping. We ordered a Cajun Combo, and Baby Kay's Combo. The olive slaw I received was cool, creamy, and crisp, topped with a blackening seasoning that I though overpowered it a bit. The gumbo was sniffle-inducing and wonderful, with a very earthy flavor and a good amount of meat in it. The crawfish etoufee was the highlight of my experience. Where I had expected minced meats, I found whole crawfish pieces (sans shell) that tasted sweet and fresh. The dish was full and flavorful, sweet but with a pleasant spice to it. I must admit that at this point, I had to surrender. I simply did not have enough room left for the jambalaya, which I am enjoying as I type this. Sticky and soft, I think it does not stand up against other's I've had. Overall, this restaurant offered great service even while busy, the atmosphere took me straight to Bourbon Street and left me wanting to return to tackle the rest of the menu, Po' Boys and some great dessert options. 5 out of 5 Fat Guy Points."}
{"text":"This is a great place for spicy Cajun for?  The PoBoys are delicious and so is the jambalaya. Our server, Val, did a great job of keeping up with our requests and sodas. The menu is quite diverse, with that Loosianna focus. The decor shows typical Cajun and Mardigras themes. Prices were reasonable, averaging $10-$12 pretty much. There is a full bar, if that suits your fancy. They do have a Happy Hour menu, too. Fun place, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"LuLu's wings are the best wings ever! perfect crispness and the sauce is to die for. The hurricane shrimp is also really good sauce.  Definitely comfort food one of a kind experience and something different from the boring chain places to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place.. There jambalaya is always the best.. I highly recommend it.. I wish they were still in Phoenix."}
{"text":"A friend and myself stopped in for lunch.  The place was pretty busy, a good sign.  We sat at \"the bar\".  It is not much of a bar but when most of the tables are full it will do.  I had the oyster Po' Boy with a side of hush puppies.  The sandwich itself was ok but the homemade potato chips tasted stale.  The hushpuppies were good but nothing special.  The ones at the Angry Crab are much better.  My friend had the Cajun Combo with the seafood gumbo.  He said it was good but nothing real special.  He did like the potato salad.  I think that the prices are a little high.  Another thing is that I have never eaten in a Cajun restaurant that did not have boiled crawfish on the menu.....that is until I ate here.  I don't know about you but when I hear Cajun, crawfish is the first thing that comes to my mind.  Not with these owners though. Anyway, not bad, just not good enough to want to go back."}
{"text":"Always glad when I am on the east side so I can have dinner at Baby Kay's. Amazing as usual... 
great atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"My husband and I are Creole but born and raised in Cali. We are here visiting and I have come every night of our stay!! This place is truly authentic! The people are wonderful, sweet, down to earth, (especially James and Kathy who are locals and genuinely awesome), and they've made our stay in Arizona just a little more special!! We love this place. The Etoufee is BOMB!! Everything is flavorful!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. A little on the bland side if you ask me. Service was okay also. Way too pricey for what you're getting."}
{"text":"Who would think in the desert we'd find the best, authentic Cajun/Creole restaurant?! Folks, this place is the REAL deal. The owners are straight from Louisiana; read their story. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the BBQ pulled pork sliders; they were perfect with a kick, but not too spicy. For dinner we shared a combination of dishes: the jambalaya, fried shrimp, seafood gumbo, sausage/chicken gumbo, and green olive coleslaw. The gumbo was pretty spicy but everything was insanely delicious...oh my, the flavors!! We ended with the bread pudding and best-I've-ever-had key lime pie. We didn't leave a crumb :)

The atmosphere is nice with live jazz/blues music. I swear I closed my eyes for a second and thought I was in NOLA! 5 star service. All around great place. Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"This is my husbands favorite place to eat!  We live in Central Phoenix and drive 40 minutes for this restaurant at least twice per month! Love it! It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time here.  We came all the way from north Phoenix to try this restaurant.  The atmosphere was good and the jazz music was enjoyable. The food was OKAY.  My son's etouffee was a little cold.  On the other hand, the service was great.   Can't say we would make another special trip to eat here again, though."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch, had the 1/2 catfish Po'boy with the chicken and sausage gumbo, with chips. Did I ordered the wrong thing? 
Nothing really wrong here, the po'boy came out dry, just fried catfish and a bun, on the side they put the remoulade sauce, lettuce and tomato, so you basically have to make your own sandwich.... The remoulade sauce, which was the \"make or break\" piece to this dish, was really inedible, quite terrible... I've had some good, and some bad remoulade, this was the worst... it's definitely not supposed to taste like 90% horseradish!
The gumbo was decent, however nothing special.. 
I really love good Cajun food, was really excited to try this place, sadly I will not be back."}
{"text":"Yup.  Good.  Uh huh.

Expensive? Yes.  Better option in Phoenix? Nope."}
{"text":"Best Cajun food in AZ hands down.  They serve all the usuals, etouffee, gumbo, jambalaya, etc. This is genuine stuff here. The jambalaya is the true rice dish. No tomato or noodles. Gumbo is the best! Cajun shrimp are great and worth getting more garlic bread to sop up the sauce with. Hushpuppies are a good alternative to fries the green olive coleslaw. The Boudin balls are worth trying if you've never had them."}
{"text":"First time and we weren't disappointed, We started with crab cake and shrimp remoulade appetizer. Then for the main course, we had a seafood combo of fried items and the catfish dinner with the crawfish sauce & green olive coleslaw. All items were excellent. Service was very good, attentive and very friendly. The draft beer selection could use improvement and we were told that adding serveral items was already a work in progress. We would recommend this offering to anybody who likes authentic food \"big easy\" style."}
{"text":"What can I say, I am a sucker for spicy Cajun food and Baby Kay's fits the bill.  It is great to have this in our hood.   Not five star dining, but the food is good and the Key Lime Pie is the bomb."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Ordered the  grilled chicken salad with bacon. One of the best salads I have had in a long time. Staff was friendly and pretty quick. I was in and out in under 45 minutes which was nice. Will return for more Cajun food like crawfish when it is in season."}
{"text":"Baby Kay's was a random find of ours, but the food was so good, we went back there only 4 days after our initial visit and have returned a few times since!

We've tried a few different menu items including the crab cakes, gumbo, shrimp po boy, jambalaya, stuffed chicken, seafood enchiladas, and shrimp etouffee. I have not had Cajun food elsewhere but if it tastes anything like the dishes served here then totally sign me up! I'm sure it's expected but everything is a bit on the spicy-side with a lot of different seasonings.

Our favorites so far have been the gumbo & shrimp etouffee because of the flavors. I only tried a bite but the crawfish etouffee was amazing as well! I would say that the only disappointment so far has been the shrimp po boy. I didn't find it to be as tasty as I expected it to be especially compared to the other items.

They offer special menu items (changes daily) as well as live music on some of the nights. The service we have received has been good every time! Overall, definitely a place to check out and one we won't hesitate to return to."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to meet up with friends.  I have been coming to Baby Kay's for several years now.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating.  The inside of the restaurant has an area for families or those with larger groups, a bar area in the back and an outside sitting area.  

I don't like seafood, but their menu has a large enough variety of non-seafood items for me to choose from.  I have tried just about every non-seafood item they have to offer too.  My favorite entrees are the Pork Chop special with dirty rice and fettuccine with cream sauce and chicken.  And I must always get the Spinach and Artichoke appetizer as well.  

As mentioned before, this is a New Orleans Cajun style restaurant, so be prepared for a little bit of spiciness."}
{"text":"Went later (8:30) on Friday night, but still busy and had to wait 30 minutes for a table; after that VERY slow service and had to ask to order. After the initial order, waiter was very nice and accommodating. Food -etoufee and fried catfish were both outstanding. Lots extra to take home. Key lime pie just an ok. Really enjoyed the live music (only till 9)."}
{"text":"I travel to New Orleans once a year and of course the first thing I always miss is the food, I searched long and high for some good Cajun and Creole food in the valley and stumbled across this gem...I absolutely love Baby Kay's Restaurant, every time I have visited their establishment I've received nothing but friendly service and well cooked food... The only type of person I would not recommend this restaurant to is anyone who doesn't like spicy food."}
{"text":"Seafood gumbo - not very fresh, smelled of seafood, very murky
Oyster poboy - mediocre, dried French bread, few strands of shredded lettuce, pickles and tomatoes on the side

Service - we were the only ones there at about 4 p.m. The waitress appeared to be uninterested and vanished for awhile 

Hmm. I heard a little bit of buzz about this place. I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try cajun food so looked up this place. It was good. Even though we had to ask to be re-sat after we sat for 15 minutes with no one coming tot he table... But we were the only ones on the patio so it's cool. The night we went there was a guy playing the blues... very nice. My son loved it.

Ordered the Cajun Combination to get a little taste of everything. Liked it all, but loved the Crawfish Etouffee!"}
{"text":"I guess you can't really expect a truly authentic cajun experience in Arizona, but the cajun food was not truly excellent, but not terrible either.  I had the jambalaya, chicken & sausage gumbo, and potato salad.  The jambalaya was pretty bland and the chicken/sausage was a bit above average.  Forgo the jambalaya and try something else when you go.  I was expecting a bit more, but it was pretty crowded for lunch so this must be one of the better Cajun spots in this part of Phoenix at least."}
{"text":"A little warm inside, but best cajun food coupled with great service.  The fried chicken, pork chops and étouffée are must-haves.  sometimes they have live music and serve Abita."}
{"text":"My wife and I are long time patrons of Baby Kay's.

We were happy to see that they had reopened at last and had to visit.

We had Po'boy sandwiches (pork, half shrimp and half catfish), a crab cake and some gumbo.

The chicken and andouille sausage gumbo was as wonderful as ever.

The crab cakes was delightfully spicy.

The sandwiches wonderful with the same crunchy chips.

We also took home some Bread Pudding which was splendid as usual.  

All in all a fantastic visit."}
{"text":"My first 3-star review. It was bound to happen sooner or later, I suppose. I just wish it wasn't for a mom & pop local joint like Baby Kay's. Let me break it down:

PROs:
Live music (not sure if this is everyday)
Friendly servers
Fresh garlic bread
Olive coleslaw

CONs:
Price - there was a good amount of crawfish in my etouffee, but it's $19.25 a plate
Portion - the BBQ Shrimp appetizer had 5 shrimps. FIVE shrimps for $9.25? They weren't very big either. The cajun combo consists of 3 cups - 1 of the gumbo, 1 of the jambalaya, and 1 of the crawfish etouffee
Food - too rich/creamy and not very spicy at all (then again, my heat scale tends to know no bounds)
Slow service - this is more of a staffing issue, I believe. Maybe the rush was because of the Deal Chicken coupon?

I shall return for happy hour next time. I would be happy to be proven wrong. My first visit wasn't quite as life-changing as I would've liked it to be, based on other Yelp reviews. Bummer."}
{"text":"Straight up, I was not satisfied! I usually go to American Legion for catfish, but I wanted to try something close to my area and I was disappointed. The only thin I enjoyed about this place was the southern music. The one star is for the music. The pictures that's being advertised on Yelp is false. But to each his own!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal! Cajun food authentic. Blues music in the background. Setting is your typical Arizona strip mall, but once inside it's \"hello bayou goodbye desert. Had the combination plate, etouffe, jambalaya, seafood gumbo. Garlic bread. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Just an update for carry out dinners....my husband has been working out of town so I've been ordering for take home lately (I'm uncomfortable eating out alone..just me) every item has been just as delicious and packed perfectly. They always ask about cutlery, which I appreciate because I don't use it and hate throwing it out. They sell mason jars of their Blue Cheese dressing now!!!(there was smiley and dancing lady emojis inserted here, they don't show, just know they were there!! Hahahaha)"}
{"text":"My husband is from New Orleans and we go out of our way to eat at Baby Kay's (we live in Gilbert!).  It's as authentic as a restaurant in NOLA and one of the best restaurants in Phoenix overall- for good tasting food at a reasonable price.  I get the Baby Kay's combo with Chicken and Sausage Gumbo, Red Beans and Rice, and Green Olive Coleslaw (OMG So freaking good!).  We order extra links of Andouille sausage to add to our beans and rice.  The bread is excellent and soaks up the little spoonful of gumbo broth at the bottom of the bowl so nicely.  My hubby orders a Turbo Dog and raves about the overall flavor combo of the Turbo Dog and the gumbo, etc.  The poor reviews surprise me because I have never had anything but a great experience, service and food quality-wise.  I love on certain nights they have the live Jazz music (singer or sax player).  I highly recommend Baby Kay's to my clients in from out of town, family and friends visiting and especially locals. Locals =you will be glad you took my recommendation."}
{"text":"Baby Kay's is still the best Cajun food in the Valley. My husband is from NOLA so we have credibility! :) 
I worry about them staying in business because their Mesa location is terrible. They are worth driving for. Truly! I love Baby Kay's combo with chicken and sausage gumbo, red beans and rice, and green olive coleslaw. So freaking good! Love the crawfish etouffee enchiladas for lunch on Tuesdays. The patio is dog friendly. And they often have live music which takes you out of Phoenix and straight to Bourbon Street."}
{"text":"My dad and I have been coming here for a while. Hands down one of the best places to eat. I recently moved out of state and I find myself craving their food all the time. My favorite dish is the BBQ shrimp. So flavorful, and delicious. Their salads are amazing too! My boyfriend loves their shrimp etouffee almost as much as I love him! HA!  The service is always awesome! We have never had a bad experience here. You can tell the owners take great pride in their food and their restaurant. Plus you can't beat Dino playing the guitar. Such smooooooooth music. Cannot wait to get back to AZ!"}
{"text":"Came here with some coworkers for lunch a while back.  Dropped 20 bucks on the combo/sampler lunch deal.  The food was decent but the portions were very small.  I wasnt blown away with food and did not think it warranted anything close to 20 bucks.  The service was also pretty weak.  I remember thinking when I left that I wasnt full, it was just okay, and I probably wouldnt come back.  Not worth it in my opinion and definitely over hyped."}
{"text":"Can't say I've ever had real cajun but what they brought out was pretty darn tasty! Parking is somewhat limited since it's located on the end of a strip mall and fills up fast. Inside is decorated; nothing fancy, just comfortable. The waiter who seated us was quite humorous and amiable (especially since I told him I was expecting 5 more people and only 1 showed up.) Since I couldn't make up my mind, I ended up with the cajun combo that was delicious. And as a treat for me and my one friend who showed up, we split a huge ice cream (don't remember what it's called). All in all, really nice place and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"baby kay's was my home away from home for a year.  initially, i went there for one reason only, they had turbodog on draft.  by the end of the year, i'd had so many great times there that i can do nothing but give them five stars.  i could go there on the verge of tears (it was a rough year) and leave a few hours later laughing.

i always sat at the bar.  my favorite bartender was cory.  she's a sweetheart.  if you see her, tell her i said hello.  my favorite waitress was serena.  her boyfriend would often come in and he and i would drink and talk.  he was all right.  i met many regulars there and they were all very friendly from the first time i went to my last.  

the owners are twin sisters, heidi and heather.  heather was always so very nice to me.  sometimes, she'd buy me a beer.  that's always cool.  cory would do that, too.  actually, almost every time i went i'd get a beer on the house.   anyway, heather would sometimes sit with me and ask me to try new things.  sometimes it was food and sometimes a new bottle of wine.  

now i don't fit the profile of their average customer.  i have a shaved head, ride a motorcycle and am covered in tattoos from my neck to my writs.  everybody else was pretty white-collar in profession and dress.  still, for some reason, i was accepted and treated very well.  god bless baby kay's.

i see some folks are cajun food snobs but i have to say their crawfish etouffee is really incredible and i can't tell you how many catfish or oyster poboys i ate.  their prices are probably not bad considering the neighborhood, which can be pricey.  as others have noted, it's probably the best cajun food you're going to find in phoenix.

i recommend you go to baby kay's, sit at the bar, order a pint of turbodog and a bowl of etouffee and say hello to people.  you'll have a wonderful time."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and never felt rushed but could sit and enjoy the meal. 

The service was phenomenal! Food was great and a live musician was a nice touch. We'll come back when the Crawfish are in season."}
{"text":"Such a fantastic Cajun restaurant. Great food and friendly waiters in a fun atmosphere. If you haven't gone yet I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"So I was jonesin for something comforting today. I'm not from the south and know nothing about the Louisiana food other than Paul prudhomme. 

Drinks - I got a dreamsicle..amazing! 

Service - bartender is super friendly and has great knowledge of the menu and drinks. 

Food - amazing I had the rice, beans and sausage. Sooooo good. I also got the green olive coleslaw. I heart this place. 
If this is what southern food taste like..I need to move. Just kidding - I'll just visit baby Ks often."}
{"text":"Awesome! My wife and I just came to the area from NJ and after a long flight, we were hungry and wanted something different.  Well this place didn't disappoint.  I had seafood gumbo and the misses had the appetizer combo with dirty rice.  Hmmm, hmmm good.  Gumbo had a good amount of heat to not over power your taste buds.  My wife's combo had a good kick as well. Portions are nice size and the service was very friendly.  Excellent Cajun twist in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Just ok, nothing to brag about.. A little pricy for what you get.. Salads are a rip-off if you ask me. Seems a little on the generic, canned, frozen side of things.. Not too bad, but not to good either, there are better places to spend my money.."}
{"text":"Tried this place after a recommendation from a friend. The chicken gumbo was really good, white rice was prefect and fluffy while the red beans were fantastic. Can't wait to go back and try something new."}
{"text":"Best food in Phoenix by far, nothing comes close. I have eaten here for over 20 years and never had anything bad. Kilt Lifter on tap seals the deal."}
{"text":"The best food in Phoenix. Any time I am the Valley I make sure to stop in. Really miss the place. Looking for something a little different? Give them a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Authentic Cajun food &  new fave, remind me of when I was in New Orleans! We had the Lulul wings, Cajun combination and the seafood basket! Everything was delicious and would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Awesome Cajun cuisine!  I got the Cajun Combo, it had étouffée, jambalaya and gumbo. Came with really tasty garlic toast.  Everything was delicious with great flavor.  The night I was there they had a gentleman playing Cajun music on his guitar adding to the atmosphere.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really don't know why this place gets any positive reviews.
I've been to New Orleans a couple times but am by no means a Cajun/Creole conniseur (SP??).  Their food is downright bland and nowhere near the level of NOLA and we're talking a cuisine that thrives on spicy/flavorful food!!  I went with five friends and nobody was all that impressed.  Cute location with patio seating and decent staff though.
All this talk about Ragin' Cajun' closing and now this crap is the best in Phoenix...my Lord I'll start a Cajun place and make a mint!!
With my Russian heritage and all it will be a home run!!
Or maybe I'll just stick to my day job :("}
{"text":"Nice environment.  Big shaded patio.  Friendly (but slow) service.

It gets four stars only in the context of a cajun restaurant in the valley.

Baby Kay's is the best cajun restaurant I have experienced in Arizona.  I really enjoyed the etouffee.  The portion was outrageous in size.  Not easy to finish in one sitting (and I finish everything).  They have an olive coleslaw as a side item that I thoroughly enjoyed.  My lunch mates had a side of mac and cheese which looked good but appeared to be a bit overcooked... the pasta was very mushy.  Overall, the food was quite good and for cajun in phoenix it was great."}
{"text":"Went to baby Kay's for the first time told waiter we wanted separate checks waiter said ok.  (30ish dark hair with tattoos.said he could do that but then when check came we had to try and figure out our own bills because he put it all together ,  we were not happy.  Then looking at Bill they had charged one of our people full price for crab cakes when they were ordered as happy hour appetizer.  Let's see13.00  verses 5.00 for happy hour.  Waiter said it was miscommunication between said person and him (waiter). No just him.  Now for food... Crab cakes had no flavor,  hush puppies were awesome.  Sauce for them awesome.  . Red beans and rice with andouille sausage was very very good very spicy good flavor salad was good . The fried chicken was good dirty rice was good the wings are awesome would I go back ? Not sure very pricey and have had better."}
{"text":"Finally got in here to try out some of their delicious Cajun food. They had previously been in a couple other locations and I had always seemed to miss visiting them both.

This place cooks some really tasty food and the insides are well decorated with plenty of Louisiana style decorations as well as several cool looking mardi gras paintings and other fun items on the walls.

We came here on a business lunch and had the chance to get here right when they opened. Service was very friendly and the food came out rather quickly. They even have an area for a guitarist that plays during special occasions. NICE!

We started with some of their Lulu's Sweet and Spicy Tabasco Wings and a cup of Chicken and Andouille Gumbo. The wings were large and fried just right and the sauce had some nice tangy flavors. The gumbo was also very good and had just the right amount of heat.

The guys ordered the fried Catfish and Shrimp entree and the Jambalaya with Andouille Sausage. Yours truly went with the Catfish covered in Crawfish Etouffee Sauce and a side of their Olive Coleslaw. Everything was spectacular and tasted just like what you get while visiting the New Orleans area.

The menu here is not very large and missing some of the popular blacked fish dishes that you usually see down south. Would like to see a few more types of seafood and possibly some spicy bacon wrapped cheese stuffed shrimp or some alligator options.

Definitely will be coming back again to try out some of their other specialties like their yummy Po'Boys and their different types of Etouffees and Gumbos. Cajun food is hard to find in the AZ desert and they do a great job. AHYEE!

4.25 STARS"}
{"text":"Awesome Jambalaya and Seafood Gumbo.  Don't go to a chain for imitation, this is the real thing.  I was offered samples and took them up on.

Ended up having 1/2 shrimp poboy and Seafood Gumbo with cole slaw.  Coworker with me had Combo platter with potato salad.

Beers from Louisiana available.

I travel to Scottsdale/Phx quite often and will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Baby Kay's for many years.  My wife and I moved to North Scottsdale a few years ago and would only make it down to Baby Kay's maybe once or twice a year.  About two weeks ago we were craving that crawfish sauce so we headed down...I'm so glad we did!  Food was amazing as usual!  On a Saturday night it was just the right crowd....it really reminds me of New Orleans.  I just found out it is under new ownership... Twin sisters and they were both working that night and they were great.  I really feel Baby Kay's is the best cajun in the state of Arizona!   I'm heading down now for the Monday special \"Beer Battered Shrimp with Crawfish sauce and dirty rice\"  Where else would I find this???"}
{"text":"Second time this week in here. They were great for dinner the other night. Party of 6 and all the food was great.  Service was on point. 

Today lunch with my dad who is in love with the fried oysters!  Ordered the Cajon burger, everything here has been great.

Four stars since the bathroom isnt as clean as it could be. The floor is kinda sticky and gross. Maybe i am being picky, but thats that. 

Great food, great service, so-so bathroom situation."}
{"text":"Great food, reminded me of my years in New Orleans. If you want authentic Cajun spiciness you need to ask for it, they tone down the spice for the Phoenix crowd. Very friendly, and very fresh!"}
{"text":"One of my wife's friends who loves New Orleans told us about Baby Kay's. We celebrated New Year's Eve 2015 going into 2016 AD there for dinner. Wowsers!!! Give this place a try! I'd only ever had gumbo at other places; Baby Kay's has a terrific menu! They have a full bar and music on the weekends too.

The food was phenomenal, the service was stellar and the prices were fair. The restaurant was clean and had a fun ambiance. We shall return AND will recommend this fine establishment to our family and friends!

A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Never really been a cajun fan but I have to say, this place totally changed my opinion on it!"}
{"text":"Food okay.  Not great.  Waiting area to be seated not okay.  We were told to wait on a bench positioned at the hallway next to the restrooms.  Not exactly good for the appetite.  We waited there 15 minutes before being seated.  

We watched other patrons come in and be seated.  I finally approached the hostess and she said she forgot we were there. Really?  The manager walked by numerous times, but did not ask us if we wanted a drink while we were waiting.  Why have the waiting area in a place undesirable and out of the hostess view?

The waiter was not familiar with the menu.  We ordered and were not given what he described was the item after finally getting our food.  He did not bring the entire order.  Forgot the fries.  I asked for ketchup for the now cold fries.  Not got it. We wanted a refill on our drink order that took too long the first time.  We finally had another server bring us 2 more beers.

Really sad experience.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"We went here for girls night and to celebrate my friend's birthday. I had the shrimp gumbo combo with the catfish po' boy. It was really good, my friend had the jambalaya and gumbo combo. The jambalaya was peppery bit still good. We ordered a chocolate cake to share berween 4 of us and it was decadent. It was also plenty big for all of us. 
The second time I came here was within a month of the first time, because my husband loves alligator and its not easy to find. It was amazing! The breading was perfectly seasoned. Try the bourbon chocolate sundae!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious :) My boyfriend and I went for my birthday and enjoyed every bite!
We ordered the Cajun combination entree and a seafood po'boy (half catfish, half shrimp).

If I had to choose a favorite, I'd choose the Crawfish étouffée - but I'd have it all again. 

We will definitely be going back. Staff was friendly and place had a nice ambience."}
{"text":"We loved going to this place when it was still at town and country. Didn't realize it was so close to our home! Food is great! Had one of the combos and it was worth while! Talk about trifecta -- gumbo, jambalaya, and étouffée!"}
{"text":"I haven't popped into a Baby Kay's since the good old days, when we restaurant staff would go hang out and drink with Remy after our dinner shifts near his original location in Scottsdale.  I remember the food being pretty awesome back then, but life and distance just got in the way of me ever going back............until last week!

This time, after checking my Yelpy app for some new local joynts to try, I found this location and decided it was time to see how things have been on the bayou front.

My Scottish buddy and I head over and are quickly attended by the oh so very lovely Heather, and are offered some yummy vittles for dinner.  The vibe is cool, the music perfect and the food...............delicious, with a slow heat build up in every bite.

Looking forward to my next visit, and hopefully, we get to see Heather AND her twin sister, for double the pleasure, like Wrigley gum, only much better eye candy."}
{"text":"We love this place, the food is incredible but for me what's more important is that the staff treat you like family. When you walk in you feel welcomed and at home right away. The wait staff are super friendly and are always quick to offer any help or advice on the menu items.  The food is awesome especially the crayfish ettoufee!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Baby Kay's since it was at its old location by the Biltmore. Everyone is always so friendly and inviting. I've never had bad service. And of course the food is amazing. My favorite is crawfish etouffe with the dirty rice. And of course the green olive coleslaw is the best! I recommend the 3 combo with the etouffe, jambalaya, and gumbo. You get a little bit of everything in one meal. It's absolutely perfect!! All in all, great location, great food, and a great experience every time I go there."}
{"text":"Baby Kay's is the Real Deal!!! Great food, Great staff,Best crawfish etouffee around !! Their shirmp cocktail and the cocktail sauce will really make your eyes water but it's OHHH so good !!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the service was great! The wings were a little disappointing after all the great reviews - we had the original and they somehow managed to lack flavor but were very tender. The duck and sausage gumbo was very flavorful and had a nice spice to it. My boyfriend had the catfish dinner with the crawfish sauce on the side. He loved the sauce! The portions are huge here but worth it."}
{"text":"We would have gone 3.5 stars, the food was good, the service was really good. 
The food was a bit too spicy for me, but my husband thought it was pretty good. I asked if you can order it mild and was told not at this time. 
The atmosphere was good and there was live music!"}
{"text":"After dining in once I knew I was hooked but I just recently found out they do take-out as well! The jumbalaya is easily the best thing on the menu (green olive cole slaw is a close second...good thing they include it for my side) and the prices are right. Score!  Great service, good vibes, and the food always comes out hot and consistently delicious! I recommend Baby Kay's to everyone willing to try some real New Orleans/Creole cooking!"}
{"text":"Service  is very good. Garlic bread  was very good . We liked their  hush puppies.  Tried their  gumbo. Best dish that they serve.  Also tried their  etouffe it was good . Also tried the  pecan pie. It was average  . . Loved their staff"}
{"text":"AMAZING, authentic food! Service was excellent as well! 
It was our first time there and we were blown away by how great the food was...we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best Cajun restaurant  I. Phoenix  proper. We had the lulu wings which has a nice tangy sauce . Chicken was cooked to perfection nice and crunch and moist in the middle . I just live their gumbo.  Lots of meat and lots of spices and heat. The crawfish ettouffe is also a signature  dish. Lots of meat and lots of flavors.  Service is always attentive  and the jazz music is great background"}
{"text":"Base on the reviews this place has received my wife and I thought we would give it a try. Wow they have the best gumbo I have eaten in years. Loved the place, the food and atmosphere were fantastic. We went for lunch and tried the combo appetizer plate to start. She had a catfish poor boy and I had the seafood gumbo. 
Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off day or something for this place..  Stopped in for lunch today, it's a Saturday.  Place is in a strip mall.  Decorations are something you would see in party city around Mardi Gras time, (pretty cheesy).  Service was nice and friendly.  Now lets get down to the food part of this.  
I'm very hesitate to say but I must, it wasn't good.. Yes I've read the other reviews but I've been and lived in New Orleans and I have to say I don't think this should be called Cajun.  The flavors are so bland I couldn't taste any spice at all on anything.  Food seemed really dry like it might have been sitting awhile.
My husband and I ordered the Boudin Balls for an app.  Now those were decent.  I ordered a Shrimp Po'boy, and my husband ordered the Jambalaya.  My shrimp Po'boy had old bread and was cut in half with 4 medium size shrimps on each half., sorry not enough shrimp for a sandwich that cost nearly 11 bucks at lunch.  The Remoulade sauce only had one flavor... Horseraddish, it was super strong and was awful.  So eh on the Po'boy, it came with a side of burnt homemade potato chips, ate like one and decided to pass on the plate of them.
I felt really bad though looking at my husbands plate.  It was a stacked high rice dish with these shriveled up sausages thrown on the side of the dish.  I had a taste of his, first the rice... really dry.. Then I took a little bit of this beef jerky sausage, it was so dry and had no taste at all.  I told him he must dump hot sauce all over that dish because there is nothing going on there.  
So yeah.. not sure if it's what we ordered or what, but Flavors of Louisiana is way better if your craving Cajun food in the valley.
P.S.  My husband ordered Tea, it's wasn't Louisiana Tea, nor sweet as they make it in the south... would have been nice to have been given the option for sweet tea!"}
{"text":"Alright.. A-hem... er, F*** I hate giving poor reviews! This place isn't HORRIBLE, but it most CERTAINLY isn't as good as what they charge for it.

I went here for lunch today because I was feeling adventurous. I felt the need for something new, and it was a toss up between Cypress Grill and this place. Unfortunately, I picked THIS place... We sat down and ordered my 4 year old the corn dog on the kids menu for $3.50. I ordered the 1/2 shrimp po'boy and chicken/sausage gumbo $10.50, and my wife ordered a chicken po'boy and gumbo of the same $9.50.

Out comes my son's corn dog.  It was nice that they brought that out quick, because kids get anxious when waiting for their food. As do some adults, I suppose... nonetheless, it was one of those frozen-type corn dogs that you can buy by the box... As soon as I saw this, my feeling for adventure was snuffed.  The food DID come out fast. I'll give them that, but it was a bit shy of good.

1/2 Shrimp Po'boy: Keep in mind, they charge $10.50 for a full sized sandwich.  My sandwich had maybe 5 shrimp on it, some lettuce and two small pieces of tomato on the side.  The horseradish sauce was, indeed, good but there lacked anything GOOD to put it on. So I just dunked my two dry pieces of bread and 5 shrimp in the sauce. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the taste.  The taste was good. but the price I paid doesn't constitute what I received.

Chicken and Sausage Gumbo: I must admit, my wife ruined this one for me.  She mentioned how it reminded her of the canned soup of the same, and, I sh*t you not, it DID taste like canned soup! the chicken was SUPER mushy, and the sausage tasted like they bought a kelbasa, sliced it up, and added it to the soup just before serving. It was not good at all.

I can't comment on my wife's po'boy, but it didn't look much better than mine. Two pieces of bread with some chicken. Meh...

That's right, I said it! Meh, Meh, Meh!!! And with that, I will be making a Meh list to put this in... Actually, I think I already have one."}
{"text":"So glad this restaurant is near my house.    The étouffée is delicious.   The live music is right out of New Orleans.    I'd go here once a week if I could."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I like the vibe in this place as well. My favorite was the Etouffee. The gumbo was yummy as well. We also ordered the sampler platter that they had and it was to die for! The staff was very friendly as well. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night. Nikki was our server.  She was wonderful & extremely attentive . Ordered the catfish dinner and chicken & sausage gumbo.  Food was great but gumbo was very spicy. Had good flavor but he spice level was very intense. Even the dirty rice was spicy."}
{"text":"Service left a lot to be desired. The bartender was my waitress although I wasn't seated at the bar. So yeah.  I ordered the crawfsh ettoufe. Really good. Spicy!  The rice cuts the heat though. I give the dish 5 stars (the entrée price is $19) . The potato salad that it came with wasn't good at all. Very dry (couldn't taste any mayo) but was heavy on relish. It just was bad. The garlic bread tasted frozen. So yeah. It's ok. The 3 stars instead of 4 are for slow service (asked for more rice and waitress/bartender forgot) and the price is steep for what it is."}
{"text":"This place is so good that I ate here for the first time recently and came back a 2nd time 4 days later.  When you come get the LuLu Wings for an appetizer.  They are breaded, fried and drenched in a honey Tabasco type sauce that is literally finger licking good.  I'll order garlic bread just to mop up the leftover sauce with.

The first time we came here was on a Saturday night and I ordered their daily special which was the Smothered Pork Chop dinner.  It comes with a side of warm bourbon fruit cocktail and my 2 sides I chose was the dirty rice and the potato salad.  I swear the pick chop was a double cut thick chop smothered in a brown gravy.  The pork was so tender you did not need a knife to cut it.  The dirty rice had a nice kick to it and the potato salad was a nice compliment to the meal.

4 days later we came back for Happy Hour.  I had the wings again and had a shrimp n oyster poboy with house made potato chips.  A very meaty sandwich and the chips were tasty.  I can't wait to try their jambalaya next."}
{"text":"Another Groupon Now Deal...I'm starting to see a trend with these...mediocre food.  I had the red beans and rice which came out warm...not hot.  My husband ordered the spicy fried chicken which was VERY crispy and the brown meat was tender and juice.  The breast, however, was dry and flavorless and needed to be brined before frying just to give it something.  I won't return.  I was barely worth the \"deal\" but I'm glad I tried it."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to update my review until after I got myself back over here to try their Thursday night fried chicken.  I'm convinced there is nothing bad on this menu.  There isn't even anything just ok or mediocre.  It's all great.

My husband and I sat at the bar last night after a long day of work.  It seriously should have been Friday yesterday.  Sure felt like it.  The sign out front said, \"a hurricane will take away your pain\".  OK.  Two hurricanes.  And an order of LuLu wings please.  

Ah.  The world goes away.  The man and woman taking turns working behind the bar are so friendly and funny that it's hard to stay in a bad mood.  And there was a father/son pair sitting at my left elbow and they were fun to talk to as well.  This was their first visit to Baby Kay's and they enjoyed what they ate, but they were eyeballing our wings, so I gave them one.  They said, \"We know what to order next time!  Those wings are delicious!\"  Yes they are.  

We also ordered the fried chicken dinner which is perfect to share because it's a half chicken, 2 sides, and some garlic bread.  We got ours with the green olive cole slaw and dirty rice.  We also tried Abita's Andygator which is a helles doppelbock.  What?!?!  Somebody pinch me!  Am I drinking beer in Germany with Cajun music in the background?  Loved the dinner and the beer.  Great all around.  

Since my last review, we were also in on a Saturday night for the smothered pork chop special.  That pork chop is nothing short of amazing.  It's so tender it just falls apart, and is covered with a rich brown gravy.  Mmmm...mmmm...that's some good eatin', Clark.  I want to go back and get that for sure.  So, yeah.  Still great food and great service.  Baby Kay's has become one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"I've been to Baby Kay's twice in the last five years. It is good. It's not great. Today I got an oyster po-boy with fries. The oysters were great. I got a to go order and I appreciated that the sandwich wasn't full assembled so it wouldn't get soggy. That said, even after I put it together it lacked that drip-down-your-arm goodness I expect from a po-boy. The bread wasn't crusty--it was very soft. The remoulade was very heavy on the horseradish.  I like lettuce, tomato, and pickles on a po-boy. My sandwich only came with two little tomato slices. I did find the pickles hiding under my fries after I was done with my sandwich. They were really tasty--wish I had found them sooner. The fries were crispy and had Cajun seasoning. The oysters were good enough, I'll come back but I'd probably get the platter and not the po-boy."}
{"text":"The ONLY place in Phoenix that satisfies this Cajun girl's taste for Louisiana! I was born and raised in South Louisiana, so I def know what gumbo and boudin should taste like! This place is so on point. 
The atmosphere reminds me of one of the many neighborhood restaurants in Lafayette, LA. 
You MUST TRY the boudin balls that are served with an apricot pepper jelly. 

I drive all the way from downtown just to eat at Baby Ks!"}
{"text":"Nice Cajun food. We started with the combo appetizer that would possibly be enough for two normal eaters. I had the crawfish etoufee and my wife had the seafood gumbo. Both were fantastic. The wine list was short, but the cab was good. We are planning to come back with our daughter. Try it if you like Cajun."}
{"text":"I am not a regular customer but I've eaten here numerous times over the past 10-years and have never been disappointed.  I've always received pleasant service. Bring your heartburn medication :) the food is awesome.  If your a penny-pincher, this place might not be for you."}
{"text":"I was excited to find this place here in Arizona. It's a small comfortable family restaurant in Mesa and embodies the soulful, cultural, and harmonious seasons of Louisiana. The food was good and I can't wait to try other options the restaurant offers. I ordered the Craw Fish Etouffe w/white rice, fried catfish and green olive Cole slaw. I wasn't fond of the Cole slaw definitely not within my taste buds but everything else was delicious. We also had hush puppies!! Loved them. 

My friend ordered the jambalaya and seafood gumbo which I was told was great but gumbo was VERY spicy. 

I ordered take out so I didn't experience any memorable customer service."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of New Orleans, Baby Kay's really made me feel like I was in N'awlins.  The jambalaya, hush puppies, crawfish etouffee ... and yes folks, even the hurricanes! ... were out of this world.  Happy hour every day from 2 pm to 6 pm, and they have food AND drink specials.  Highly recommend trying to get there during happy hour since it's easy to get that bill up to a $100 for 2 :)"}
{"text":"GREAT food. 

Skip the po boy (they're just decent) and get the combo :)  yum yum yum

I felt like we were in NOLA again for a few minutes :)"}
{"text":"I like, no, LOVE this place. The food is amazing. Hush puppies are the best I have ever had. The shrimp etouffee is consistent and amazing. This place stands out because they are 'consistently' amazing.  Did I mention this place is amazing! Huge fan for over a year. They have never served me a bad meal. Thank you for awesome food."}
{"text":"The major problem with this restaurant, and I've been there twice, is that the service is slow and poor, and that really puts me off.  A few nights ago I ate there with two other people and the restaurant was only about half full.  We were all very hungry, so I asked if we could have our garlic bread straight away.  Of course, says the waitress.  15 minutes later - no bread.  I asked again and it finally came out.  How hard can it be to toast bread and smear it with garlic butter????  Poor performance, especially since it was not busy.  The drinks were equally slow to come out.  I don't understand what is so complicated about pulling a draft beer!!!  The food is generally pretty good, especially the crawfish sauce you can get with your catfish - really great.  The jambalaya leaves a bit to be desired, however.  Too dry and starchy.  The red beans are good, though, as is the catfish, albeit a bit heavy on the batter.  Oh, I grew up in Cajun country, so I know how it should be prepared."}
{"text":"I came here last week with Michael for dinner.  I must admit that this place has been around forever and this was my first time.  Michael had been here before but it had been quite some time for him.  We both decided on the gumbo... I had the chicken and andoulle sausage with a salad for my side and Michael had the seafood gumbo with the green olive slaw.  My salad was pretty good...very basic, but the salad dressing was pretty damn good I also tasted the green olive slaw, it was pretty good also.  The best part was the gumbo... we both really enjoyed that.  We each also had a cocktail and the total was $39.00 ... that was great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Went with the coworkers. Showed up with 7. No wait for lunch, immediately got seated. The food was great! Great value! Bathrooms were SUPER clean! Good so good I forgot to take a picture until I dug in... had crab cakes and seafood basket. Loved the crab cakes and spicy mayo!!!"}
{"text":"I am so thankful to have found this place ! I am orginally from Southwest Louisiana myself. I grew up in Lafayette and went to college there. I still have family there. But I have to say that the crawfish etouffee and boudin balls I had here were excellent ! If I could I would eat here everyday ;) I am beyond thrilled to have found a piece of home so far from my home."}
{"text":"Very tasty Cajun food but they really needed a lunch menu. Portions were large and way too much food for a summer lunch."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my sandwich & would definitely go back.  There was a live musician on the Wednesday night I was there.  While the music was great, it was a bit noisier than I was expecting, which made it occasionally hard to hear my group.  However, it was still a fun night with some high quality Cajun food."}
{"text":"Fun little spot! Customer service is friendly! The food was amazing! Seafood Gumbo, Fried Catfish we're very good! Strong drinks (Hurricane) very tasty! It did take a little long time for the food to come to the table, but I don't imagine that's the norm."}
{"text":"This place was WAY overpriced for mediocre food.  The only thing I really liked was the seafood ettouffee.  The sweet and spicy wings were not bad but tasted better heated up later.  The barbeque shrimp wasn't what I expected at all but was pretty good, maybe its better in the entree version over rice.  They were out of oysters for the po boy so I couldn't get it although I wanted to..  The gumbo and jambalaya wasn't anything to write home about.  :)"}
{"text":"I'd hate to waste a star on this place!

I lived right outside of The French Quarter in New Orleans for 8 months. I remember the best of Cajun food and this place was far from what I remember. I'm not big on seafood but everyone at our table ordered a seafood dish and all were not happy with their entree.

What did I order? I ordered a simple Chicken Po'boy sandwich. How can a Cajun restaurant get this wrong? This place did. The chicken was placed on bread that was hard. I expected the chicken to be smothered in BBQ sauce. Wrong! The sauce was on the side. The lettuce on the side of dish that was to be used in the sandwich was a bit on the brown side. The fries were cold. Yuck!

Waitress was great. She was the best part of this dining experience. Never again."}
{"text":"Crawfish étouffée is fabulous!  Bluesey singer on Fridays topped off our evening."}
{"text":"I've been to Baby Kay's three times. The first time was probably about eight years ago, and I honestly can't remember what I ate or any details so it can essentially be ignored. The most recent visits were about a month apart and the last was today. The food is okay, but extremely overpriced and underflavored. The red beans and \"rice\" dish, w/andouille for an extra $1, is essentially a plate of beans with about two tablespoons' worth of white rice, plus about an ounce of their green olive coleslaw. Ok, it -was- reasonably spicy but should have been no more than about six bucks because what it really equated to was an appetizer as far as I'm concerned, and the amount of beans grossly outweighed the amount of rice. Their special today was 8 fried shrimp with dirty rice crawfish etouffee and one side. I got the coleslaw again. The amount of food, for $14, was pitiful - a half serving, essentially. And this time the flavor was just totally lacking. The full crawfish etouffee dish price is $19 which is murderously expensive and as I discovered today it just doesn't have much flavour. The dirty rice had what appeared to be minced beef in it and was light on the pepper. Even the garlic bread wasn't any better than I could have made myself with a cheap baguette from Fry's, butter and some chopped fresh garlic. I know everyone's been fapping on about authentic flavour here, but if that's what this is then I much prefer Pappadeaux. Save your money - there's no value to be had in this restaurant.

Edit 20130902: Tonight my wife made a simple meal of a packet of store-bought Tony Chachere jambalaya with some chopped up polska kielbasa sausage in it. It was delicious. Taste buds still working - check."}
{"text":"Well worth the drive. The best crawfish étouffée I had so far. The crawfish were so plump and juicy. And the garlic bread.... So delicious."}
{"text":"We love this place. The service is always fantastic and the food is just incredible.This restaurant hands down has the best crawfish etouffee. We also enjoy the Lulu wings. We have not ventured to try any other dishes, but the table next to us got the catfish and it looked oh so yummy."}
{"text":"Stopped here while I was in the area for something different. It was during lunch and had a break in my day. Service was prompt and good. Had the jambalaya with cole slaw and rice.  The spiciness is up there with a good Mexican dish. Rice was not the best but not the worst either, it looked like instant and had been sitting for a bit. Cole slaw...... No, I've had better at Church's Chicken. BUT, I didn't go hungry."}
{"text":"Was driving to get pizza for lunch and spotted Baby Kay's so I decided to try it. The friendly waitress, Andrea, recommended the lunch special, Shrimp and Crab stuffed poblano, battered and deep fried on a bed of Cajun Rice. THE DISH WAS AWESOME. I will recommend this awesome little jewel to all my friends!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! The entire family went their for my brothers birthday and we all agreed that this place is awesome. Great food, authentic, good customer service, and live entertainment.. we will deff be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Food is off da fuckin chain. Straight . The seafood gumbo is puff. The seafood etoufee is crack. And the jambalaya is straight too. Damien is on point as a server. Speedy, polite and made great suggestions. 

I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"This might just not be my thing because it came highly recommended from two friends.  Also, perhaps I just ordered poorly.

Tried the crab cakes.  Just okay and didn't taste very fresh.

Had the red beans and rice with sausage.  It was to spicy for me to enjoy and just was otherwise boring to me."}
{"text":"If you were going to reheat my 20$ etouffee, at least it should be hot, not lukewarm... 

My fiancé and I came in the knowing the price would be moderate-high. However, we were not expected to pay 40$ meals on old, reheated food and burned garlic breads... seriously my breads were burnt on one side and soggy on the other side lol. And the food was so disappointed my fiancé jokingly said the burnt breads was the best part of the meal haha. 

In addition to it, the coleslaw was a bit weird and the potato salad wasn't even as good as safeway's 

I added a star for the nice server we had. However, it would be a 2 stars. 

It s our second time and would be our last."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out finally and was well worth the trip.  Traveled from Ahwatukee, which nothing is really that far but for food sometimes its not worth it.  Either way, after reading other yelpers reviews and seeing the pics for HH everyday from 2-5 figured a Saturday afternoon trip over after some shopping sounded like a plan.  As most places, a strip mall restaurant doesn't look like much on the outside.  Dark windows because of sun and a small patio but too hot to sit outside still.  First impressions was good.  Nothing spectacular for decor. Tables are well placed apart from each other, a few booths, a great use of chalkboard for specials, and a decent bar but not over stated.  Wait to be seated, which wasn't crowded so about 2 minutes before a waiter came to seat us.  Menu is simple which was where I got hopeful they actually specialize in what they cook instead of some of these places who have too many selections that all taste the same.  We ordered 1 item from the starters and that was the fritters. They were pretty darn good.  Didn't taste the oil, good corn bread mixture, could have incorporated actual corn to make them better but they served with a horseradish deep that was fantastic.  From the HH menu, we selected: Hurricane shrimp, Crab Cake, Duck and Andouile gumbo, Seafood gumbo, Crawfish etouffee, BBQ pork sliders and LuLu's wings. I've posted pics as well but here's my take - Shrimp were fantastic, 6 shrimp swimming in their honey hot sauce with a scoop of white rice in the middle.  My BF could have licked the plate.  Sauce provided heat but not where you can't taste anything else.  Crab Cake they slipped on the sage and it tasted like thanksgiving stuffing.  Not much crab so I'd pass on that one when I go back.  Gumbos were amazing!  This is where they have concentrated their efforts and KUDO's to them!  Seafood gumbo was a tad better than the duck/sausage from a fat content.  They were both prepared perfectly.  The Crawfish Etouffee was rich and flavorful and bursting with crawfish.  A must try as well.  LuLu's wings were deep fried and then sauced with the Hurricane sauce but not so great IMO.  They turned out a bit too sweet for my tastes.  But based on the consistency of the batter on the wing I bet their fried chicken is good.  The wings were a nice size but again, too sweet for me. And last but not least the pork sliders.  Great amount of pork on each slider, sauced with very well could have been the Hurricane sauce - was sweet, tangy not spicy BBQ flavor. Could taste a hint of smoked flavoring but definitely not smoked. Not a BBQ joint however so will let those slide.

My Rating - Gumbos: outstanding, Etouffee: outstanding, Hurricane Shrimp: Very Good; Fritters: Pretty good,  CrabCake:  Not so Good; Wings: Okay; BBQ Pork Sliders: Pass

Definately will be going back to try some other items on their menu!  Hope this helped someone!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this restaurant for a couple years now and was finally able to make it over there last week. After I was seated, I waited quite a while(this was at 3pm) for the waitress to get my food order. I was a little preturbed by this but once she left the kitchen and got to my table, so was actually quite pleasant. I explained to her that this was my first time and asked for a recommendation. She enthuisiastically recommended the fried shrimp po'boy and chicken/sausage gumbo which I ended up ordering. The shrimp in the sandwhich was pretty well cooked, and not overdone so the shrimp were quite juicy still. Unfortunately, there just wasnt enough shrimp to fill in the bread that came with it. The gumbo was delicious and a definite highlight of the meal. 

I would recommend this restaurant, though it may not be the best value for what you get."}
{"text":"Great food, great bar, great server Kori. Keep it up Baby Kay's. The gumbo is delicious, the red beans and rice rock, the wings are to die for, and the fried chicken is second to none! Do yourself a favor and go get ya some!"}
{"text":"I remember going to this place when it was still near Biltmore in Phoenix and I can't believe it moved to Mesa, and honestly....neither can my waist line! This is like ten minutes from me at ASU.

The etouffe and coleslaw are amazzzinnngggg. I day dream about the crawfish etouffe almost weekly. It has a great spice to it and is so authentic to the food in NOLA (go figure). They have specials everynight, but somehow I always manage to show up on Thursdays, and each time I go my boyfriend gets the fried chicken and I get the etouffe with garlic bread and we share. 

They also have abita and other New Orleans brews here, so you really can't go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"The food here is sooo good, I'm always too busy digging in to take a picture. 
The crawfish etouffee is the BEST and their po'boys are so fresh.
Genuine New Orleans flavors in the desert!"}
{"text":"I love a good jambalaya, and this place really came through. The rice, chicken, and sausage were all delicious. Perfect amount of spiciness, and an amazing flavor.

The dinner came with a small salad, and some good garlic bread. I'll definitely be back to try some gumbo and one of their desserts, maybe the bread pudding which is supposed to be amazing."}
{"text":"We love the food at Baby Kays!! Tonight though we had something happen which left a bad taste in our mouths!  When my party of 6 arrived we told our waiter that we would be needing 4 seperate checks and we were led to believe that this was not a problem.When our check came he told us that it would take him too long to figure it out seperately and that we should do it ourselves on the back of the bill and write out our seperate amounts so he could give us all our seperate total! I thought thats what I was paying him to do???  NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I HAD TO FIGURE OUT AND SEPERATE MY OWN BILL AND WRITE IT DOWN FOR THE WAITER! If seperate checks was a problem we should have been told so at the beginning of our evening and we could have adjusted accordingly!  If we all were at 4 different tables we would have recieved seperate checks, so what was the problem! This was very annoying to me and it is unfortuanate because food was great as always and the service was great up to that point! If seperate checks are a problem then please tell your guests up front so this never happens again!! It's too bad a fun night out with friends left us in a bad mood at the end of out evening!! Will I still eat at Baby Kays?  Yes! I just hope they take this consructive criticism to heart and change things accordingly!"}
{"text":"I went here last a year and a half ago and enjoyed the food.  Definitely would go back if in the near vicinity & in the mood for Cajun food."}
{"text":"Being that I am a New Orleans native, this is by far the most authentic Cajun food i have found in the valley. The wait staff is always friendly and even remember me most of the time. They serve a lot of New Orleans drinks including Abita beer. The seafood gumbo is awesome! For lunch you can get a half poboy and a cup of soup which is the perfect lunch portion. I tell anyone that asks me about finding good Cajun food to go to Baby Kay's. Can't wait until their new location opens."}
{"text":"I had the fettuccine with cream sauce (added chicken) it was really good. The sauce had a little spice to it and the serving size was generous. I think this will end up as my go-to dish when I come here. The hush puppies were light and crisp served with a tarter sause and a ketchup.  I did not try the ketchup because after I had the tarter sauce, I just wanted to eat as much of that as I could. I think they mixed some horseradish in it. So good. 

The restaurant had a cool, laid-back atmosphere. The music was great and so was the artwork (most of which was for sale). Service was OK but the place was not busy when we were there so I would expect it to be fine.

I'll be back. I just wish it wasn't all the way in Mesa."}
{"text":"Soooo close to home. I wanted to love it more. 

Good food. Great service. There was a shrimp appetizer in a horseradish sauce. Delicious. 


The waitress brought out extra dipping sauces and the fried cod was perfectly crisp."}
{"text":"Seafood etouffee, gumbo, jambalaya and the Baby Kay's Seafood Appetizer plate ...  YUM!!!  We got a great bottle of wine on special for $18.  The waiter, Nick, was fantastic and I wish I lived closer so I could come more often.  

They are moving to a new location and will be closed after Aug 31 until Nov sometime."}
{"text":"Great time in Mesa.  Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  Crawfish etouffee was fantastic.  Generous portions. Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Rib sticking red beans and rice, cold beers and a live blues guitar player. What more could you ask for. I had eaten at the Phoenix location years ago and have been a fan of the Mesa location since it opened. Don't let the outside fool you, once you walk through the door, the interior decor, smell of the foods, and sounds of the blues playing take you to another world. I have never gotten the chance to go to Louisiana so I cannot speak for authenticity of the food but it's good. From the red beans and rice to the mango habanero salad dressing, it's good. 

The Louisiana beers and bar drinks don't disappoint, and pair well with the food. 

The parking can sometimes be an issue, but most of the time, you can get in when you need to."}
{"text":"We are from Houston Tx and we know good food.  The drinks were good, the LuLu Wings are succulent. I love the olive cole slaw and Gumbo as well.   Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"Like others say, get the chicken wings! Sauce was great, but it is your personal preference to have it on the side or all over the wings. We appreciate awesome chicken and they deliver! So it was on the side for us. The sauce was great and we took some home. Also the Gumbo, I've never had gumbo before and it was a mouth full of flavors exploding in my mouth with the perfect amount of heat that makes you want more and more! Run, don't walk, get there as soon as you can! Man-oh-Man, save room for the chocolate sundae."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Baby Kay's for years, I use to frequent them when they were by the Biltmore.
Still good cajun food, the whole Bayou atmosphere. 
I think it's a bit pricey, thats the only thing that keeps me from coming here more often.  Over all the years the food is still great!!!"}
{"text":"I started out with their LuLu Wings (Amazing) Then went for the Cajun Combo and that was the perfect trio for Cajun food."}
{"text":"I've read reviews and thought I'd give it a try. For a place as well spoken of i found the service very lacking in customer service period. 9 people in there they were un-attentive to service at tables the bar received great service. Will not be returning.....
 
Food was very overwhelming as far as spice goes, 

i realize Cajun food is spicy and I've had good Cajun food but what we were informed of the spice levels poorly."}
{"text":"What a find. In from out of town and yelp did not disappoint here
Great food and music"}
{"text":"I tried the gumbo, crawfish, catfish, and dirty rice and everything was perfectly seasoned and fresh. The waiter was amazing and the atmosphere relaxed. I enjoyed the live blues player and service was pretty quick."}
{"text":"I had seen this place for a while I stopped in it's a small personal place good is very good the service was amazing I would recommend to anyone Ricky was my server she was great. Good portions if you leave hungry it's your fault give it a try"}
{"text":"Amazing! Recommended by a friend and so glad! Crawfish étouffée was amazzzzing, Bloody Mary perfect spicy, gumbo yummy, garlic bread yummy, and great happy hour 
Can't go wrong 
New regular spot"}
{"text":"Heavenly hush puppies, chicken gumbo, jambalaya and crawfish etouffee. Very friendly service as well. My go to place for Cajun/Creole food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are both from Louisiana so we were excited to try Baby Kay's. We both had the Bloody Mary which were spicy and full of veggies which we loved. He got the shrimp po-boy and I got the veggie étouffée. Both were quite good. On our second visit he got the sampler which he was less impressed with. Next time we'll stick with the poboy! No vegan options unless you are in the mood for a salad."}
{"text":"Etoufee is to die for! 

I've only ordered takeout. So I can't speak on the dine in experience. Everyone I've picked up food from was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The Friday/Saturday pork chop special is unlike anything I've ever had before... just make sure to get there early since it seems to always sell out early."}
{"text":"Word of mouth has lead me to many great dining establishments all over the valley. Tonight, I got to share one of those discoveries with my oldest son. A former co-worker introduced me to Baby Kay's Cajun Kitchen a little over a year ago. Since then, I've been back a few times to enjoy the authentic Creole cuisine.

Like me, my son has an adventurous interest in food, so I knew he would enjoy something different for dinner. We started with the Baby Kay's Sampler. This was a huge portion of deep fried goodness! It includes fries, fried oysters, fried shrimp, hush puppies, jalapeño poppers and fried catfish. Awesome variety! And considering it's a fried appetizer, you can still taste the quality of the product.

My son made a great selection for his entree. He loved (and devoured) his Pulled Pork Po' Boy. I told him it would be stuffed. And he wasn't disappointed. I've enjoyed a Po' Boy on occasion here.

I chose the daily special (Seafood Enchiladas) which our server Andrea described perfectly. She did a really amazing job too and even my son realized that her service was spot on. My enchiladas (more like mini burritos) were stuffed with shrimp and crawfish etouffee, served over dirty rice and smothered in a tequila cheese sauce. Oh my goodness! I cannot even begin to describe the flavor. And the portion was huge!

Besides great service, great atmosphere, great food and great company, what made me happy was hearing my son say he was going to have to tell his friends about Baby Kay's. Word of mouth. Pass it on!"}
{"text":"I've been to Baby Kay's a couple of times and have sampled the catfish, gumbo and red beans and rice. The catfish basket and gumbo were so so while the red beans and rice took the gold. I think Baby Kay's needs some work on their lunch menu. I personally think that $50 for lunch for three people that didn't order any alcohol is a pretty steep price to pay for medicore food. I'm not too excited to make a third trip to Baby Kay's."}
{"text":"I love this place. I live in San Diego and the first thing I do when I get off the plane in Phoenix is go here. They have the best catfish po boys I've ever had."}
{"text":"OMG the shrimp etouffee. No really. OMG. SO delicious it's ridiculous. 

Went here the night of Fat Tuesday... so cliche I know. Got there about 5:30p. Place was packed of course. Hostess let us know the wait for a table would be about an hour and half but we could drink/eat at the bar in the meantime. Sold. 

Started out with a hurricane (it was Fat Tuesday after all) and it was pretty good. $5? Even better. 

Had an app at the bar, the crab cakes. Moist and delicious but super spicy. And I love spicy. But this was almost too much. Still, I would get it again. Yummy. 

After getting a table (yes, about an hour and half later), we ordered another app (hey, we'd been drinking for an hour and half!), the Lulu Wings. These were OK. The flavor was awesome, kind of a honey-Tabasco. But I thought they were a bit tough and dry, and I didn't like the fact that there wasn't a dipping sauce for them. Won't order them again. 

For dinner, we ordered a smorgasbord of food so we could try lots of things. I had the shrimp etouffee. See first line of this review. OMG... I was too full to try anything else at this point but the hubby liked everything he had (gumbo, red beans/rice, crawfish etouffee). 

p.s. the garlic bread that's served with everything is also delicious. 

Final verdict, unbelievable food and I can't wait to go back.  Especially so I can try the bread pudding."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Yum. Great device.  My favorite is crawfish ettoufee. My daughter loves the catfish with crawfish sauce. Tons of flavor."}
{"text":"This place is great. The green olive coleslaw is one of a kind. Get the combination plate for a good sample of everything. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was top notch, the wait staff was helpful. Love the atmosphere and location, great place to arrive early and walk around or just relax on the outdoor area before your meal. There is a cigar shop a few doors down great place to grab a cigar before or after your meal but thats a whole other review. The food is authentic you'd feel like you were on the gulf coast or perhaps even in New Orleans. I had ordered the Crawfish Etoufee creamy and served on rice in case you're not familiar with the entree.  Very well done and had the right amount of spice and flavoring wasn't too spicy  or hot (heat). You definitely cannot go wrong with this place if you're taking out of town guest there or business clients."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for Saturday at 7pm knowing it would be busy. Our server was Martin S and he did a very good job considering he had two other large parties as well as our party of 8. While we were waiting for our meals our drinks were empty. At that time the owner checked on us and got us our refills. This was also when she informed us that Martin went to go help out the backed up kitchen. A few minutes later Martin came out and apologized for the wait. He then offered a round on the house! Although the food took a little longer to come out we were very pleased with our experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Service was awesome and food was very good. Friendly staff and plenty to choose from on the menu."}
{"text":"What a great experience! Excellent service with food to match. I've had Cajun other places but they really do knock it out of the park here. The portions are very good size too. What they call a cup of soup is literally what all other places call a bowl. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been exposed to too much Cajun dining but I was thoroughly impressed with my meal. I had the gumbo and the jambalaya, both chicken and sausage, and both tasted great. I like my food spicy and rarely do I have a meal I don't think about adding hot sauce and this was one, and not because of the heat but because of the flavor and heat!"}
{"text":"If you like spicy food then this is the place for you. I had the fettuccine in a spicy cream sauce with andouille sausage ($13.50). It comes with garlic toast and a side (I got the green olive slaw). The food was excellent and a huge portion (I took home more than I ate). The service was great. The decor was New Orleans camp (lots of skeleton stuff). 

My friend had the fried catfish and shrimp basket with fries ($12.95). The fish was fine, but the fries were just ordinary freezer bag fries. She said her food was OK.

The restaurant is clean and parking is close to the door. They have live music on Tuesday evening and the weekend evenings. There is a mix of tables and chairs and some booths. There is also a small patio area. I recommend this local business."}
{"text":"Some of the best Cajun food I've had in a long time. Beautiful gumbo, Po Boy sandwiches are phenomenal. Service was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. I'll definitely come back for a little more southern goodness. :)"}
{"text":"Had trouble finding the place, even with directions. Had to walk almost through the kitchen to get to the restroom. The food was mediocre. The waitress seemed to be in a rush & did not give me proper attention. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Because we are so far removed from the French Quarter my stomach rarely directs me to Cajun. Let's be honest there are few options in this town.  So this becomes the default spot to scratch the gumbo itch.  
Above average food, better service, higher than expected prices."}
{"text":"Pros: 
- I really enjoyed the live music

Cons:
- The service was not outstanding (our server had a bit of a bad attitude)
- Food was meh at best, I had the jambalaya which was dry, and spicy. I appreciate the heat but have had so much better. Hubby had the chicken gumbo, he thought the flavor was good but nothing special. 
- chocolate cake was a refrigerated Costco slice sold, resold for $7 a slice when the entire cake is only $16 (been a member for 10 years it's my fav choco cake so I know it when I have it).

I appreciate having a Cajun spot in the area, but I am very underwhelmed. For two our bill was over $55.
Won't return here but if anyone could recommend a truly great spot I'd be happy to check it out (:"}
{"text":"Service was great food was horrible! Taste like it was precooked and rewarmed when I ordered the wings! Presentation was nice but the taste was awful"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great service, enjoyable live entertainment on a Wednesday night!!!! Great place for Cajun fare!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome crawfish conffitte. Would highly recommend the combination player with the jambalaya and chicken/sausage gumbo and crawfish conffitte. Catfish is amazing as well. Live blues music by an older gentleman. Don't go thinking he'll blow your mind, not by a long shot. It's more about the ambiance which really makes you feel like you're in Louisiana."}
{"text":"came here for the second time last night and it was great!! i was pretty bummed the performer left as we walked in but it's all good (fri night at 8:30 pm) cuz the first time we were there, we got to enjoy the blues performer! i was sick all day and the only things that sounded good were a bloody mary and pasta (super weird lol) but our server ricki said their bloody marys were pretty spicy but really good! after i squeezed the lime in there, it was perfect! glad i went with her recommendation! i had the veggie fettuccine which was BOMB. but again, i was sick so only ate a few bites.. rickis team member asked if she could box it up for me so i said yes and thanked her. i didn't think she heard me when i said, \"it's really good, i just don't feel well\"-- which was no big deal! but i took it out of the fridge to have for brunch today and there was a little note that said, \"feel better :)\" on my box. it's the little things like that that make restaurants to the top of my list! ricki, thank you to you and your team member and to our server we had the first time (it was back in may but i can't remember his name)! amazing customer service from beginning to end! we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix on Spring break vacation, we found Baby Kay's by using the entertainment coupon book we bought to use while out there. They were in the front for fine dining, and had a great coupon deal, along with a sample menu. Everything on the sample menu sounded delish, and we very much like the spice of Cajun cooking. It was a little hard to find, although we were not at all familiar with the area. We had the wings as an app. and used the Louisiana gold hot sauce, something new to us that we are having trouble finding in Ohio since we fell in love with it there. The gumbo was outstanding, and even the alfredo pasta had a spice sprinkled on top for a Cajun style kick... it was unexpected, and awesome! Huge portions - that we both had plenty to take with us for a whole other left over meal. ... the prices were great, especially with the coupon (or actually the entertainment card that they punch for fine dining restaurants). Excellent staff- close to closing for the night, and welcomed us in, and didn't rush us at all - made sure we were happy with everything we ordered, very friendly! Definitely would recommend it for any one who likes a little Cajun kick, and something different from chain restaurants..."}
{"text":"Baby K's is a good little Cajun joint off of Dobson Rd in Mesa. Nice ambience, live music, smiling servers and very good food makes the place definitely one of the best representatives of southern food in the east valley.

I tried the fried chicken special on Thursday night and it was excellent. Huge portions, moist breast meat, crispy chicken skin, lots of spices including perfect helpings of cayenne on the chicken made the dinner great. The dirty rice is a perfect side. I also tried the gumbo and jambalaya from a friend's plate and they were very tasty as well.

Definitely a place to check out if you like southern comfort food."}
{"text":"I've never had Cajun food in Louisiana so I can't make a comparison even if I wanted to, which I don't.  It seems a lot of people like to complain about ethnic food being Americanized or regional styles not living up to expectations.  We live in Phoenix people-Phoenix, AZ, USA, not Phoenix, Japan or Phoenix, New York.  I have eaten Mexican food in Kentucky of all places.  Was it the style of food I am used to being a native Arizonan?  No, but I can appreciate that it wasn't bad, just someone else's interpretation.

So, the end result is I like Baby Kay's.  I've eaten here several times and never had a dish I didn't like, nor bad service.  I like that their hushpuppies actually have flavor beyond that of a wad of cornmeal.  I like the gumbo and jambalaya.  I tried the crawfish ettouffe and it was great.  I like that the potato salad is not swimming in some overly sweetened mayo concoction.

So while it may or may not compare to your version of authentic Cajun cooking, it is still a great place for a meal."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim and it did not disappoint! They had live music that complimented the Louisiana vibe. Our server, Chris, recommended lots of good stuff to us and we went with the lulus wings, hush puppies and the Tuesday special of seafood enchiladas. They have quite a few abita beers since abita is based out of Louisiana. Will be back to try the Cajun combo!"}
{"text":"Catfish and red beans and rice. I have had a lot of fried catfish and this is great because it's lightly dusted in cornmeal so you can taste the fish. Red beans and rice, i'm no expert, but I thought it was great. Friendly quick service and a really nice clean new looking place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years...the best.  One of my favs is the lulu wings."}
{"text":"It was our first time there and the customer service was excellent! Our server Kayla was on top of everything and super polite. Our food came out quickly, hot and delicious. Some of the best Cajun I've has ever had! The live music was a plus. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Now I am not a Cajun food expert but on a recommendation yesterday I stopped in to give it a shot. I ordered the shrimp and catfish por boy and the seafood gumbo (asked them to throw a little sausage in for kicks).  I tried the gumbo and the flavors were so rich and the seafood was cooked perfectly.  Sent the por boy with husband today for his lunch after slowly reheating it. I will let you know what he thinks later.  I will be back and strange as it sounds but it just might be today!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, if you saw my last review of this place, I said we have tried almost everything on the menu except the burger.  Well, can't say that any longer.  Last Saturday my wife and I ate there to celebrate my birthday, what a great time.  Martin was the waiter and we were able to visit with one of the owners, Heather.  Well, we thought it might have been one of the owners, it might have been two of the owners, as Heather informed us that her twin sister also was a owner, but they had never pulled the twins game!  :-)  

Anyway back to the burger, I have stayed away from it as blue cheese is not one of my favorite cheeses, but Martin recommended it so I trusted his recommendation.  So glad I did, it was outstanding, one of the best burgers I have had!!!!  Heather said it was her recipe so kudos for her for that. 

I can say once again, love this place and it is one of our go to places in the Mesa, Dobson Ranch area."}
{"text":"This is my neck of the woods...I was waiting to get my haircut and had a bit of sinus congestion that needed some clearing up so I figured so good spicy Cajun food should do the trick.

I got the chicken and sausage gumbo with the side of Cole slaw and an ice cold beer. The food was great just as I expected, the place was not to busy for a Saturday afternoon, I was by myself so I moseyed on up to the bar to make my order.

The bartender slash waitress seemed a bit pre occupied and in general I was not super happy with my service but to say the least I am a fan."}
{"text":"What? I never reviewed Baby Kay's? unbelievable!
Well, there is not much I can say because every time we go there we end up ordering the same thing! haha...

And that is the Cajun combination: Chicken Gumbo, Crawfish Etouffee, Chicken, and Sausage Jambalaya, cup of each. It comes with a side, I always get the cole slaw (which I love, it has green olives) and hubby always gets the potato salad, which he also loves.

I just checked their site and it says they are hoping to reopen on 2/2014 on the new location. Counting the days!"}
{"text":"Try the Lu Lu wings! Etouffee is loaded with Seafood. Girls are great, friendly and quick on the serve."}
{"text":"Good hushpuppies. Good gumbo. Great service provided by two very cute twin sisters who I think are the Cajun owners. A tad pricey for a working day lunch crowd. I don't get a very authentic feel from the food but that's not to say it doesn't hit the spot. The decor is not much to speak of. I mainly come here because I get cravings for gumbo."}
{"text":"On a date here Saturday night.  We ate the crawfish etouffee and shrimp basket while listening to live jazz music.

The crawfish was definitely frozen.  It did not take fresh at all.  Compared to the crawfish etouffee I normally get in South Houston close to Galveston Bay, this would be barely edible.  However I understand we are in Valley so it is what it is.

The shrimp basket was good and the homemade chips were great.  I'd give that 4-stars.  Service was good here.

Drinks were horribly made.  I returned the hurricane and painkiller.  I felt bad after returning the first 2 drinks and kept the third (renee margarita), even though it was just as bad as the first drink.  Don't try drinks here.

If I rated this restaurant to Houston's top crawfish places, it would rate a 1-star.  If rated to New Orleans best places, it would rate a zero.

Update: I don't like wasting food as I ate a couple bites Saturday night so I brought it home. Upon heating it on the stove for lunch at noon the next day, I felt bad for the rest of the day after eating it.  Won't be coming back.  Maybe some things should be thrown away."}
{"text":"OMG! This Cajun Kitchen ROCKED! I have spent plenty of time in New Orleans, LA and the thing I miss most is the food!
This Cajun food is simply the best in AZ!
Everything was authentic and oh sooo good!
Not to mention, live music the Saturday night we were there.
The service was top notch! Efficient, laid back, and she never missed a beat! Typical of NOLA service!
The Etouffee & the bread pudding was the best!
You could taste the bourbon sauce in the bread pudding, which melts in your mouth! It did have coconut in it which was a bit different for me.
ALL in ALL I wish this place had a brunch.
I definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I called in and placed an order for pick up. We order Hush Puppies, 2 order of the Lulu wings and the crawfish etouffee. 

Walked in to the bar because that's where they told me to pick up at. I sat down for a good 5-10 mins before I was even helped. This was a Friday night and an hour before closing. It wasn't that busy at all. There was three people behind the bar but none seem to notice me ?. Service issue?

Anyways I was really looking forward to trying the chicken wings. I saw pictures and it looked great. Supposedly the chicken were suppose to be sweet and spicy. It tasted like they over did it with the honey  because it wasn't spicy at all. The chicken tasted old like it's been in the freezer for months. It wasn't juicy at all and super dry. 

The crawfish etouffee was the only thing I could eat. It was my first so I couldn't compare it to other places but it had a nice kick to it and the crawfish was nice and meaty I had some pretty huge chunks of meat in there.

That's all I got I had high hopes for this place but that chicken wing ruined it."}
{"text":"had a little free time and saw this was new to the area, not the valley but the area. lucked out and started with Lulus sweet and spicy Tabasco wings...unbelievable. and the main course was a Cajun Alfredo. delicious. my other diners were in love with their meals as well. it's slightly pricy but you pay for the great cuisine for sure. as a self proclaimed sucker for Cajun, this hit the spot. We will be back. definite."}
{"text":"Baby Kay's has alright food and alright prices. Nothing from my two experiences that would blow the mind for greatness. 

I believe they have new owners now and we had experienced big ownership. 

The old owners the food was really good but the service was absolutely terrible! I mean terrible. The owners were not friendly and made you feel awkward going there, but I liked he food so occasionally still went.

With the new ownership it has changed to really great service! Unfortunately the food really wasn't spectacular so I never went back.

They just need to make good sized portions and have more flavor... It just wasn't quite enough to get us back."}
{"text":"Having just been to New Orleans a few months ago, I think I'm kind of ruined on Cajun food anywhere else. This place is located in a strip mall, and the building left quite a bit to be desired. There was a lot of cool art on the walls inside made by local artists that was for sale at reasonable prices. If I would've had an easy way to get a painting home, I would have bought one! 

The food was just ok. I had the crawfish etoufee which had a decent spice level to it, but it was extremely thick and had a weird texture to it that I had trouble getting past. One of the people with me ordered shrimp etoufee and it was extremely soupy and has barely any shrimp. It was a pale yellow color and looked like chicken noodle soup, which was odd compared to what I've experienced in the past. Since the rue base is usually the same for these two items, it was strange to see the color and consistency so drastically different. My friend commented that the shrimp etoufee was not very spicy after he tried my dish. Also, I will note that I was supposed to get a side dish with my entree, but it never arrived. The entree portion was huge, so I didn't miss it. However, it would have been nice since it was on the menu and I ordered it.

Overall, this isn't a bad stop and I have no idea what other Cajun places exist in this area so it's an ok option if it's your chance for some Cajun food. It definitely doesn't live up to actual New Orleans food, though, but I'm not sure if anything could!"}
{"text":"We just happened upon Baby Kay's just days after it opened.  We have been there many times since then and it just keeps getting better and better.  The ambience is awesome and the older gentleman that provides the live music is delightful.  You can not find a better place to eat with a warm, friendly atmosphere and to top it off - Baby Kay's has the best catfish in AZ!."}
{"text":"4 stars because it didn't quite beat my absolute favorite Cajun restaurant, but that doesn't mean it wasn't awesome! 

I was impressed with the duck and sausage gumbo during my first visit to the place - the meat was high quality and it had a more unique flavor to the gumbo that I hadn't had before, but definitely liked! 

My wife had the jambalaya a la carte - her personal favorite - and ordered a side of crawfish sauce to pour on top of the jambalaya. She was raving over it! Her recommendation is, if you like crawfish, THAT is the way to do it!! If not, the jambalaya by itself is absolutely delicious! 

We will certainly go back. They have awesome sounding specials including tender pork chops, and seafood enchiladas. We are also excited about the live music. Happy hour deals are great as well! This place may become a new favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"My co-worker took me here and I'll forever love her for it. 

Best. Gumbo. EVER.

And the garlic bread. And the shrimp cocktail. And the crawfish. 

I think I know what I'll be eating for lunch tomorrow. You should too!"}
{"text":"This review is based on one visit at 2pm in the afternoon, so maybe not the best time of day for top notch food. Was in the area and had been wanting to try this place based on other reviews. Ordered a cup of seafood gumbo that was priced at $6.50 for happy hour and a oyster Po'Boy sandwich which was about $13. Received a small cup of gumbo with several tiny pieces of shrimp. The flavor and heat level were good but way overpriced and disappointing overall. My wife's chicken and sausage gumbo at least had lots of meat. Po'Boy was equally disappointing and overpriced. Came out not assembled so you had to do that yourself. Bun was cheap light weight bun probably store bought. The sandwich included about 6 or 7 tiny oysters, one tomato sliced in half, couple pickles and some shredded lettuce. The sandwich itself was only about 7 inches. I could hardly taste the oysters for the thick cheap bread. If you want a good Po'Boy try \"Flavors of Louisiana\". Their Po'Boy is outstanding."}
{"text":"I work right around the corner from this place and it seems to be out go-to watering hole to get hammered and eat spicy food.  Not that we're picky on the getting hammered part, but the food here is damn good.  I'm not really a cajun food person to begin with, but there a few awesome things about Baby Kay's that you can't get just anywhere.  

1) Seafood Burrito on Tuesday nights - holy mother of goodness...I'm not sure how much of the ocean is actually thrown in that tortilla, but it's fantastic.  There's a ton of cheese, cream sauce and I'm sure a ton of other uber-healthy ingredients.  Amazing.  If you've never been here before, you should hit up Tuesday nights. 

2) Friday/Saturday Pork Chop - again, not really a pork chop person.  I wouldn't go to a restaurant and scan the menu for a pork chop...but this one is INSANE.  You don't need a knife...it's so moist (I hate that word, but I'll reserve the right to use it when talking about Baby Kay's pork chop) and juicy I really want to curl up and die a happy person after consuming half a pig.  Yum is all I can say to that visual.

Yes, they're kind of pricy, but it's not outrageous.  I've had the gumbo and the sampler platter too, all of which are delicious.  The bar is great, I notice they serve a lot of beers on tap, but they also have a full bar that I've taken advantage of multiple times.

Also - during the week they have a guy (who may or may not be  homeless, it adds to the luster) who plays jazz music inside the restaurant and it's great.  It's like Enya when you're in a massage, it really makes you feel as though you might be in Louisiana for the night.  Thankfully, you're not, b/c that place sucks.

Try it out and go on a Tuesday or Friday/Saturday night!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Great gumbo and delicious home made potato chips.  Lots of flavor and a perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"This is the best Cajun resturant in Arizona. I've lived in Louisiana before and this is as close as it gets for AZ. I had the crawfish ettouffe and its was awesome and the most authentic I've had since living in Louisiana. My wife had the sampler and she loved it. The atmosphere is great. The live music added to the experience. It was kinda loud though. The waitress was kind of wierd. I would recommend this to anyone looking for some good  cajun food. It is on the pricey side but its worth it."}
{"text":"Some authentic Cajun flavors. I have family in NOLA and visit whenever I can. This measures up for giving me a flavor of the city 2000 mi away."}
{"text":"Amazing cajun southern Louisiana dishes. Crawfish etouffe comes with alot of crawfish and a bit spicy but delicious. Half soup gumbo and catfish sandwhich for a great price. Crunchy fish packed with just enough spicy. Came for lunch to try out and plan to go back. The menu said they had 2 locations, tried Mesa and next on list is Scottsdale. The dirty rice is to die for and they have live entertainment on Fridays and Saturdays. I approve of this joint!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant after finding it by mistake.  What a quaint little place...more quiet actually in the  bar area...at least on a Tuesday.  Food was good, prices not so bad.  We had an appetizer sampler, the reason it's CAJUN...hot and spicy most of it.  I LOVED the crabcake so much i ordered the \"Seafood burger\".  It was FABULOUS.  My husband had the beef Po'Boy, not bad he says.  The Live music was a nice touch, not too loud, and better than the same ol same ol you get at other restaurants.  My only complaint...not complaint really just strange..was going into the kitchen to use the restroom."}
{"text":"nothin' to boast about. they need to season the crawfish with spices and not hot sauce. that goes without saying. which leads me to say i don't really dig what they're puttin' out with the crawfish boil.  being a southerner out of place sucks one in when one sees a crawfish boil is being put on...  boy, was i the one put on."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the center of the East Valley and worth the trek from the West Valley, Baby Kay's does Cajun Cooking like it is done in restaurants and back yards from Houma to Bossier City!  This is true low country cooking, right here in The Valley of the Sun! 

If you are a Cajun you will know and appreciate all of the traditional cooking here.  I need not tell you what it tastes like, you grew up on this stuff.  If you are new to Cajun Fare, this is the BEST representation of Cajun food you will find anywhere west of the Sabine River.  Do not miss an opportunity to eat and drink here.  They have all of the standard beers and some Louisiana Specialties! 

Service is Great!
Food is OUTSTANDING!
Atmosphere is classic French Quarter!

Bring a friend, bring a date, bring your family but most of all BRING YO SELF and have a hot bowl of Cajun Cookin!"}
{"text":"Baby Kay's old location back in the Town and Country area never disappointed.  I was afraid after the move, they wouldn't be worth the huge drive to get out there.  THEY ABSOLUTELY ARE!

Same great atmosphere.  Great service and the food is as good as it ever was.  I gotta get my Cajun on about once every other month.  We will definitely be back.

Great food to try:
Etouffe
Gumbo
Po-Boys
Boiled Craw-fish (in season)"}
{"text":"I like Baby Kay's for a number of reasons

1.Its locally owned
2.Good patio
3.Friendly Staff
4.Exceptional happy hour deals.
5.Great Food!

I've had just about everything on the menu at one point or another and there isn't too much that will disappoint. The Gumbos and Jambalaya are delicious. The po boys are... Well, they're po boys. By their very nature they are just plain 'ol bread and seafood. Avoid the Shrimp Remoulade unless you REALLY, REALLY looooove horseradish and mayo.  The green olive slaw is fantastic and so are the hush puppies. Try the Lulu's wings if you like a spicy/sweet wing. The food overall is fantastic, comforting, well seasoned and filling.

The staff is knowledgeable about the menu and willing to answer any questions you may have. They are always friendly and accommodating. Quick they are not. But the food is outstanding and everyone is always so nice, I don't care that my dining experience is usually a little slow.

My boyfriend and I come here maybe once a month. Its in a great location and reasonably priced. Love this place."}
{"text":"Best restaurant as far as service and the food is great! Service has always been exceptional and environment is super laid back and welcoming. Love it. And... the food is really good."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cajun Combination and it was AWESOME. If your close by you have to check this place out, if your not close by you need to make the time to go here!"}
{"text":"Had the half catfish sandwich and chicken & sausage gumbo and it was fantastic!!!! Excited to have another great local place to visit for lunch and dinner in Phoenix. :-)"}
{"text":"Now this is some good grub! Mom, my bf, and I came for lunch. After our meal my mom complimented me on choosing the restaurant and said we would have to come back. Mom and I both highly recommend the fried catfish. It is the best we ever had tasted. It melts in your mouth. Also, the fried oysters are a MUST. And of course, do not leave until you try the green olive cole slaw. I love my southern cookin'! Can't wait to return and have another bite of catfish!!"}
{"text":"Had my wife & a friend in for her birthday last night.....Susan enjoyed her Seafood Enchilada so much, she is having again  it for breakfast today.....Thanx to Baby Kay's for making my wife's  day extra special !"}
{"text":"While everything we had was delicious, its kind of expensive for what you get. 

Etouffe, gumbo, jamabalaya, YUM.

We got a fried sausage appetizer that was... interesting. Not bad, just...different. I'm always down for new and different. Prob wouldn't order again though.

I think my only disappointment is in the limited menu. Various Catfish, etouffe, gumbo, jamabalaya, po' boy, and salads. That's about it. 

The previous Cajun business that was in this location was, IMO, superior. Bigger menu variety with better prices. I'm sad that its gone. It was damn good, but again, so is this. 

Overall, yum!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place!!! How have we not visited before?? Sweet tea, duck & andouille gumbo, lulus wings, catfish basket and shrimp fettuccine were all exceptional and delicious! Service was perfect. This is now our go to spot for date night. Love everything about it. Thank you!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has its hits and misses for me.  In generally the staff was friendly and pretty quick. The beer selection here is simply not good; they carried only one ipa from Abita,  and it was marginal at best.  

We shared an order of hush puppies and the cajun combination plate with seafood etouffe, chicken and sausage gumbo and jambalaya. The hush puppies were super delicious! The combo plate however left us both wanting. We both loved the etouffe, thought the jambalaya was just okay and didn't like the gumbo at all. I tried a few times but there is some sort of spice that was sweet and overpowered the dish. 

We did enjoy the live music and the very relaxed atmosphere. I won't be running back here, but might try the etouffe again sometime."}
{"text":"The service here is awesome! I can honestly say that I'm not much of a Cajun person, but met some friends here (I've only had Cajun literally 3 times in my life).... and I was skeptical. However, once we walked in, the decor is fun, there was live music playing, and the service was absolutely stellar. I really enjoyed being there and the servers  were very helpful when assisting me making a food choice!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere, excellent service. I love Cajun food and this was top notch, the seafood gumbo was delicious!!!! First time here and we will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!! My wife and I live in the neighborhood and have been driving right past this place for years and never stopped, but... a friend of ours went on and on about how good it was so we checked it out. The food was great the staff is amazing. We've been back several times and have always had a great experience. Authentic Cajun food and very reasonable prices. Live entertainment really made the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place we went and picked up an order to go we live about 20 minutes from the restaurant and when we got home to sit down and eat our food we'd found a hair in it.  we called the place and told them about the situation and they were willing to give us a free pasta but After experiencing that it was just not worth going back.  the customer service was great I'm pretty sure they don't put hair in everybody's food, stuff happens but the proper precautions should be taken to prevent that."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good. 
First of all, the live music is great. It's a little loud if you are looking to have a large group. The food though, that makes up for anything you could ever find wrong. Seriously, it's that good. 

I tried the chicken and sausage gumbo, the jambalaya, and the crawfish étouffée. All three were amazing. The étouffée was to die for. I could have eaten that for hours. It came with garlic bread and salad. The garlic bread is killer too. Seasoned perfectly. The salad was great. Tried it with a mango habanero dressing.

Service was outstanding. For a group of 20 people, they served us beautifully as if we were a small crowd. Overall an absolutely fantastic place. 

We went with a large group as part of our Friday night foodies group. There was not one person who didn't rant about how good everything was. We have been to a variety of over 20 different Restaurants and this was by far everyone's favorite. Some even said we should stop going to other places and go here instead EVERY WEEK.

Don't just think about going here. Get the keys, jump in your car and go! It's just that good."}
{"text":"I love Baby Kay's like pirates love stealing. It's good enough to wipe clean the memory of taking a horrible girlfriend there for our first date. The craw fish ettouffe is something I have to stop to contemplate each bite of because I struggle to comprehend why it's so delicious. The gumbo and jambalaya are also stellar. I like to merge all three in the Cajun Combination. 

They make a raspberry vinaigrette there that deserves it's own paragraph and is mandatory on your dinner salad. 

Another fantastic creation here is the apricot habenero glaze that one would think would over-power a chicken salad, not the case. Now I know most of you see the h-word and imagine terrible pain, this dish is not prohibitively hot, it manages to catch the flavor of the much maligned pepper and only a fraction of its fire. 

 If you happen upon Baby Kay's  on a day when the special is seafood enchiladas, get them and call me for a refund if you anything less than amazed. 

 Staff is pretty low key and nice here. Not a good call if you're in a hurry, but worth being late over. I usually sit at the bar if minutes are precious and outside if my time is my own. For what you get the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Very impressed and stoked to have found great cajun food out in the east valley!  Their lulu wings were the best I've ever had and the fried catfish with crawfish etouffee was also amazing. My wife got the gumbo which was great as well. We'll definitely be coming back!  By the way, the service was also perfect!  Everyone made us feel welcome and it had a great family feel to it."}
{"text":"Their food was all the same. Hot cayenne pepper. No depth of flavor or skills. Deep fried hot food.  If that sounds like you, you will love this place.  Even their cole slaw was pepper laden. My son who loves it all hot voted never to return. Just no flavor to go with the pepper. So sad. I love southern food."}
{"text":"I love this place. The chicken, andouille sausage Jambalaya is great. So is the crab or crawfish etouffee. Between March and June they have crawfish boils. get a couple of pounds as an appetizer and go to town on them. Dont forget to suck those heads!"}
{"text":"Tried this for first time. We had the catfish dinner. Food was excellent. Service was a bit slow considering that the dinner rush was over. Prices a little high I would have given a five except for service and prices."}
{"text":"So I was here Tuesday night, the first time in a year and prior to that it had been over 7 years. This place used to be packed! Even a year ago it had a decent crowd. When we arrived.. one table was sat with a child running and screaming through the dining area. Because of that we chose the bar. 2 guys at the bar that's it. Needless to say our service was good, how can it not be right? Started with BBQ shrimp.which was realy good but not BBQ, it was more of a spicy lemon, which was fine because the server explained that. Had I expected BBQ I would have been disappointed. Garlic Bread Great..Hush puppies a little over done but still good. Followed it up with the Bourbon Chocolate Sauce sundae..um yumm. So al in all food no complaints whatsoever. Atmosphere.. there was none. We might as well have been in a one horse town. While we were there the guys left and 2 business like women took their place at the bar. What was sad was the people watching. One of the women was just short of bragging how she used to go there all the time and how she knows all the employees...went out of her way to get the bartenders name and introduce herself like she was somebody. It was sad. She was name dropping herself! Food great.. atmosphere 'nil it was depressing..Its my opinion that unless they change up their location to something with more foot traffic (Mill Avenue would be perfect for this place... other spots such as Desert Ridge, Fashion Square, Westgate even..)they're going to waste away. Town & Country Plaza just isn't what it used to be and it's sad because their food deserves the attention, it really does."}
{"text":"Had the 1/2 po'boy and cup of gumbo. Delish! Slight bitterness in the gumbo, but mixed in a little of that mayo/horseraddish it made it great. Nice place for lunch, sat outside in the perfect March weather."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Very clean restaurant. I had the catfish and it was perfectly cooked. If you like Cajun food you will love this.  Awesome restaurant, highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was our second time coming here and as usual it was delicious. My wife ordered a painkiller and I had a hurricane, both of our drinks were strong and well done. I had the catfish sandwich with a bowl of chicken & sausage gumbo. I loved everything about it including the hush puppies I almost forgot to mention. My wife had a bowl gumbo and of course loves it as well. This is a place that makes me love living in the east valley."}
{"text":"Really satisfying meal with delicious flavors and dishes. 

We ordered the seafood gumbo, sausage gumbo, etouffe, jambalaya, and everything was 5-star worthy. Our server was also really attentive and gave us some great recommendations with the New Orleans beers. 

I wish they were at a better location, because they deserve to be busier with such great food. 

Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here after a long hot day of logistical business. We had the chicken and sausage gumbo and their cajun burger. Both were very good. Spicy! I liked it but my nose ran a lot. It has a habit of doing that.... the carmelized onions and bleu cheese with the sausage in the beef patty all rolled up into one nice bite. The drinks were great, too! The gumbo seemed pretty authentic and was very tasty. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Spicy, tasty Cajun food with friendly, Southern atmosphere. 

I came here with family for a birthday and arrived late to a tray of fried everything. I'm not a huge fan of fried food, so I immediately became concerned. That said, I ate some of everything, and it was all pretty tasty.

But the entrees are where it's at here. I had the Cajun Combination, which included jambalaya, crawfish etoufee, and gumbo. The jambalaya was decent. I tried the duck and andouille sausage gumbo, and the duck was really tender and tasty. The etoufee was the highlight of the trio. The crawfish was plentiful, and the sauce was tasty. Oh, and the vinaigrette option for the salad was excellent! There's a nice, spicy kick to most of the dishes. Just right for me (granted, I'm a bit of a pepper belly). I also tried a couple bites of the catfish dish with crawfish, and it was fantastic! The catfish was juicy and tender inside and crispy outside. Perfect! 

There was some nice live music for part of the meal. The service was decent and friendly. 

Great option for Cajun!"}
{"text":"Crawfish etouffee with garlic toast, a side of red beans and rice, a large carafe of iced tea, with key lime pie for dessert. That's what I had for lunch on Friday. I had forgotten how spicy Cajun food is and was only able to finish half of my meal, but the crawfish etouffee was G.U.D. good!

Serena will take care of you!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the catfish dinner the cornbread batter was light and not heavy on salt. They have a guitar/violin player who plays along with recorded music ala karaoke. He plays a good mix of instrumental music. Service was good and prompt. The only negative I had was the standard sauce that came with catfish was a horseradish very potent. Lucky there was a bottle of pepper sauce on table saved the evening.  There are additional sauces available but they cost extra. Green olive coleslaw was good. We will be back"}
{"text":"This place is killer! The staff is awesome! The menu unreal! Bar is well stocked, and the waits are reasonable. Live music takes you straight back to New Orleans. The smothered pork chop special is something I recommend every time we take friends and when they order something else they always steal mine. It's a special Friday and Saturday I believe."}
{"text":"We had the Cajun combo and catfish/shrimp po'boy sandwich. It was to die for, I haven't ate here in over 11 years and it's EXACTLY how I remember it!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food need more servers so they can visit table to see if anything is needed. Music was nice place was clean and food was fresh"}
{"text":"I love this place. Love the staff. Live music, happy hour from 2-6 M-F, 2 -5 on Saturday. Love the menu. Crawfish étouffée is delicious. I've also tried alligator here. It was awesoooommme!  Come for a drink stay for the atmosphere. Become a regular because your always welcome"}
{"text":"Went there last night for my wife's birthday (Friday).   Took our 1 girls (ages 6 and 5). 

They had a blues guitarist that was pretty good and girls enjoyed it. Food was great.   Prices reasonable.  Would definitely return.  

Service so so.  Had a 6:00 pm reservation, arrived at 5:55 pm and was seated at 6:15 pm."}
{"text":"Ok...I'm not from New Orleans or (N'awlins) but I have had authentic creole.  Right out of the gate the sweet tea needs work...seriously if this is supposed to be southern you'll need to improve it quite a bit (let this southern boy know if you need some help).  The hush puppies came out and I was immediately nervous because they smelled like they were burned, however they were very crisp and perfect consistency on the inside with great flavor along with horseradish sauce.  I ordered the cajun combination and everything was great. I'm not going to say that the gumbo is incredible in fact it was a touch bland but it was still passable.  The jambalaya was flavorful and was much better than I expected.  Now, the pièce de résistance...the étouffée was phenomenal!!! I have been searching for a place that does this right and I have found it!  I would not usually give a high rating because of the few inadequacies but the étouffée blasted this place out of the park for me.  The service was prompt and friendly and major kudos (maybe small to some but it is that little extra) they packed my leftovers for me.  Also, this is the only Cajun joint that I know of that serves it up this good in AZ (seriously I think you 'Trina refuges need to get to work opening up some more worth while joints)!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Food, Wonderful Staff, Great Music Many Nights. A Fantastic Place serving up the best fried catfish and crawfish etoufee you will ever eat in a super friendly setting. Don't miss trying the duck/andouille sausage gumbo. It is phenomenal."}
{"text":"The only reason I may never give this place five stars is that I can't eat anything else but the Pork Chop on the weekends. With all the gravy AND fruit cocktail (hard core ol skool) it is always the perfect bite. I have had the cole slaw, potato salad and red beans & rice and I do recommend those. The cole slaw is very green olive so be warned."}
{"text":"Live down the street and love great Cajun food. They serve authentic plates. We have had the gumbo and étouffée. Both are incredible! Prices are reasonable and worth the quality. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Haven t had Cajun and was craving, used to go to the one in SCottsdale all the time, but that cute place closed, so we went to the one in Town and Country mall, that place is not at all attractive to look at, but everytime we go we have great servers, great martinis, and the food is as close as we can get to cajun in Phx, we re always surprised at how slow it is when we go, considering the food is that good, its definately a fun eating experience,"}
{"text":"This place had a good vibe and pretty interesting entertainment with a musician freestyling to popular songs. My girlfriend and I had a good experience overall with quality and service. We ordered the cajun combination and the cornish game hen. The house salad was not too appetizing but when is a house salad really going to impress anyone anyway. The cornish game hen and the crawfish etoufee were really good. The only downside is that the chicken gumbo wasn't that great and most of the dishes were on the salty side. That's the only downsides. If I ever were to come again I would totally get the crawfish etoufee."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our experience here. Their are so much options from their menu. Their Catfish Po boy was so delightful. The ambiance was so great and really alive. I love the music and well lighted. Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, great service. Only not 5 stars cuz it needs something to pump up the atmosphere a bit."}
{"text":"my review is already biased from the start.  i've tried cajun cuisine about 3 times now and i'm not a huge fan.  i don't mind eating food with seasoning and some pepper.  but i don't like eating fire sauce in any of my food.  lol.

well, i ordered the lunch special which was some type of chowder with jambalaya on the side.  the jambalaya was way too hot for my taste buds.  i was on fire.   and the chowder was just okay.

the service was good but the food experience was just okay.  i really can't give the food a bad review because cajun is just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Fantastic Cajun cooking.   Never been disappointed in catfish which is rare to get anywhere else.  Good appetizers with frog legs a rarity!  Great service and good selections of the standards in creole and jambalaya.  A unique atmosphere with some cool live music also.  Been there a half dozen times in the last year.  Great eats!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, full bar and food was delicious. I had the 1/2 Catfish po boy and cup of shrimp étouffée - AMAZING! My husband had the Chicken Gumbo and he loved it. We also started out with the Boudin Balls for our appetizer. They were so spicy but so good! We couldn't stop ourselves from eating them(came with 3 balls). We loved the musician that was playing the flute, violin and guitar the whole time we were there. Overall, we will be bringing friends and family here in the future! Love it!"}
{"text":"Wanted something different for lunch, so I looked up Cajun food and discovered this place. We had a nice comfy booth, and I was very pleased to see they had real sweet tea (I was raised in South Carolina and sometimes miss having it at every restaurant). I had the combo with gumbo, jambalaya and the crawfish etoufee. They were all delicious. I don't care for tomatoes, and I thoroughly enjoyed these because none of them were tomato base. I even had a few leftovers to take home. My boyfriend had their Cajun Burger, which he said was very good, the only complaint being that the menu said it had your choice of cheese as well as some blue cheese crumbles, but the waiter didn't ask and it was served with no cheese. So if you go and order that you might want to ask for the \"cheeseburger\"? Otherwise all was well, and I was totally digging the blues music."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the fried catfish and tried the crawfish etouffe.   The food was amazing it was the best catfish I had since moving from Texas!!!!"}
{"text":"The service that I received from Kayla is 5 star however everything else was not worth much. If you come by yourself they seat you way in the back behind everyone else where you can't even see the live music (oh the music was good). I kept wishing someone from the big group directly in front of me would go to the bathroom so that I could see. Then the extremely extremely disappointing food. The Gumbo taste okay however it had an odd taste and a bunch of overcooked crawfish that was the best thing that I had and it was not all that great. The barbecue shrimp should be called Worcestershire sauce and overcooked shrimp. All I taste was Worcestshire sauce they should take that trash off of the menu. My garlic bread was burnt, the wings were just ok. The sweet tea was the best thing that I had."}
{"text":"As Cajun Food goes there is none better in the Valley. The food is great traditional New Orleans flavors. Now saying that if you eat at the tourist traps on bourbon street and like their food you will be blown away with Baby Kays. 
Get the Cajun Combo and you wont be disappointed a healthy sample of Gumbo, Etouffee, and Jambalaya. The Rene wings are great if you are looking for something different as wings go. The Smothered Pork Chops are amazing and BBQ Shrimp are great. Lots to choose from and the only Cajun Restaurant in Phoenix that serves real Cajun Food.

Will always be my Go To Cajun place"}
{"text":"This is really one of my favorite places to get some good cajun food!  Their fried catfish is nice and crispy, their blackened catfish is juicy and spicy and their red beans and rice are quite tasty.  

Let's talk about their gumbo....hmmm....hmmm... good!  They offer three different types: chicken and sausage, seafood and duck and sausage.  I really love the seafood gumbo, but don't sleep on the duck and sausage.  It has a different flavor, but it's wonderful.  

If you're in Phoenix, you have to try this place.  You'll feel like you're in the Big Easy!!"}
{"text":"Average Cajun food, nothing special.  I came here late on a Tuesday night.  Few people there.  It's a dive of a place in a strip mall.  A bluesman was playing nice quiet blues on an electric guitar...very nice.  Kinda scruffy place with all the basic Cajun staples.  Nothing fancy.  Decent brews.  I think the bar tender was waiting tables.  I probably won't be back, but I had heard it was great and wanted to try it.  I think I like more upscale digs and fancier/pricier fare."}
{"text":"Hands down best Cajun food in the Valley. Very authentic, having traveled to New Orleans many times. One thing you have to remember, this is not the gritty Cajun food you may be used to, it is of the more refined higher-quality variety. The food here was created by a native chef from New Orleans and resembles more the high-end style of cooking rather than ordinary street food. If you are not familiar with the higher quality Cajun food, you may be disappointed that it is not what you are used to. For those who can appreciate haute cuisine, this is a must. I highly recommend their Crawfish Étouffée, without peer or equal anywhere in town! A good Étouffée is the true measure of a Cajun restaurant. Also the seafood Gumbo is truly magnificent, light with clarity rather than heavy and thick, it has many layers of flavor. One of the best Gumbos I have ever had. Their signature Cole Slaw is light and refreshing rather than heavy, it includes green olives which give it a unique and distinctive Cajun flare! Overall, great service, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place but a lik pricy, so make sure you bring your wallet and your patients because the service is not as prompt as you may like."}
{"text":"This is our families favorite restaurant.  Our kids beg to go here all the time.  We love so many of the items on the menu it is hard to narrow down a favorite.  We usually end up with some of their seafood gumbo.  It is by far the best we have had in the Arizona.  It is very rich and buttery in flavor and the quality of the seafood is very good.  The crawfish etouffee is also to die for."}
{"text":"Delicious po boys and awesome service. glad we moved to this neighborhood. we'll be back"}
{"text":"I must first say that I am from cajun country (born and raised in Vermilion Parish, cher). So, I rarely try any \"cajun\" restaurants outside of south Louisiana. Places like Mimi's are as authentic to me as Taco Bell is to our south of the border friends. 
But, this place is close to hubby's office and I saw something I NEVER see on menus...BOUDIN. This got me excited. If they have boudin, they've got to be legit, right?
The best thing was their crawfish etouffee. Hands down. They do use cream of mushroom soup in it. Depending on the recipe your momma uses, this may be \"cheating.\" But, it was good. 
The shrimp poboy was good. I can't give a place 4 or 5 stars based on a poboy since that's pretty hard to screw up. And, you can get poboys at places like Bubba Gump and Lucille's. 
The gumbo was okay. But, I am biased and rarely like any gumbo as much as my own (even at restaurants back home). 
The boudin was terrible. Seriously, terrible. Even if you've never had real boudin, you won't like this. Maybe it was bad? It had the same flavor as some dressup lipstick I had as a kid. I had to spit it out in my napkin. 

I do like that they fly in crawfish. And, I like the decor. It's simple...just like many of the hole in the wall places I've enjoyed in Louisiana. 
I'd go back for a poboy or etouffee if I was in the area. But, wouldn't make a special trip for it."}
{"text":"Baby Kay's is right in my neighborhood but I just hadn't taken the time to try it - HUGE mistake on my part.  Food was outstanding.  I had the pork chop (strongly recommended by our server) and it was fantastic.  Can't wait to go back to this place.  
PS: I started with a cup of gumbo and I'll get a bowl next time! :-)"}
{"text":"Best pork chops I've ever had in my life.
Portions are impressive and the service is very good.
We were there when there was live entertainment, jazz.
Great little place. Wait staff wants to be there.

Fun
Try the pork chops!!"}
{"text":"Best cajun in the valley!! Always busy, but for good reason. Also have great drinks for awesome prices!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I am soooo glad that I just moved moved down the road. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"The food tastes very good! This was our first time ever eating Cajun food and it did not disappoint. The waiter was very good and took his time explaining the different dishes. The Cajun combo is the way to go, it included a little bit of everything, gumbo, jambalaya, and my favorite: etoufee. Most dishes were available with either seafood or chicken and andouille sausage. We were there on a Saturday late afternoon and there was a gentleman playing live music, he was awesome and it added to the great atmosphere of the restaurant. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"At first the service was slow they were slammed... I can understand- However once we ordered they were on point. We got the sea food sampler with fried oysters! BOMB! Followed it up with the gumbo and jambalaya combo... both dishes were the perfect balance of flavor and spice."}
{"text":"Great for lunch. The choices are reasonably priced and great bang for your buck. Much better than other similar seafood establishments in the area. Friendly staff and excellent service. All the food is authentic and fresh. Live entertainment at night makes a great night experience. 

Bottom line is the food is fresh and good. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area so we don't know much about anything or where is good to eat. My boyfriend and I were driving around and stumbled across this gem. 
We had Damien as a server who was awesome, attentive and sweet. He was swamped with a lot of tables but we noticed he catered to each one evenly. We had a cup of chicken and sausage gumbo, and crab cakes for an app which were both SO good. And we had the fried seafood baskets too. My boyfriend got the fried oysters which neither of us enjoyed but that's okay. The love music was on point. And everything overall was a good experience. We definitely  be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The last time we were here, I got the Poboy Sandwich and didn't like it, but this time, I got Fettucine with Vegetables, and I ate every bit of it! My family got Crawfish Étouffée, Baby Kays Sampler, and the Catfish Dinner. All dishes got thumbs up! Thanks for a great Fathers Day dinner!

Ask for Martin! Great service, and he brought carafes with tea to our table so we could keep our glasses filled - a real pet peeve of mine. Btw, I didn't see this on other tables. Martin's the bomb! Lol!"}
{"text":"There was this little sandwich shop just around the corner from my office that had the most amazing chicken and sausage gumbo, plus a number of fine sandwiches.  But sadly they shut it down about a month ago and I've been at a loss for a good lunch place ever since.   Besides having some great lunch food, the owners and staff were fantastic and are missed.   HOWEVER, the owners also have another place that is doing great, and its Baby Kay's Cajun Kitchen.   So I drove the 10 minute drive and can't imagine why I waited until now to visit them.   The food was incredible, the menu has many more choices, and a dessert of bread pudding about put me into a food coma!    The gumbo is perfect every time, and the Shrimp Po'Boy was excellent with the horseradish sauce.   And it was sure nice to see both Heidi and Heather again!   
I'll continue to miss their sandwich shop, but I will definitely be making the short drive over to Baby Kay's again.    
Get there a little early, they had a line forming around noon, so lots of other people like the place too!"}
{"text":"I love hush puppies and this place has the best hush puppies I've had in a long time! I also had a delicious spinach salad with chicken. 

The staff is nice and the theme is rad. it could make for a super romantic date night, and definitely my new fave night time spot but the lights were on so bright when we went in for dinner. 

The windows are shaded really dark to keep out the Arizona sun's heat which is great, but misleading. We walked in expecting it to be dim mood lighting and jazz music but instead it was really bright and open. Not very private and romantic, which was what i was hoping it would be. Really took from the ambience. Im hoping they set up some mood lighting to go with the jazz theme. :) and maybe a couple booths. 

But that's just how I'd like it, maybe they're going for a dif mood. :)

Either way, get those delicious hush puppies!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Scrumptious sea food, lovely music, awesome drinks. Crawfish etouffee is a must try..."}
{"text":"For lunch I had the crawfish etouffee and it amazing! The spicy was not too much but just enough. Took a little time to get it but hey for the food I got I completely understand. I'll be back soon for happy hour and some beers."}
{"text":"Authentic Cajun food. Live Music. Family / locally owned. Don't be fooled by the strip mall location, this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Bland, uninspired, boring and dark. Great happy hour spot. Don't miss Spicy Mary. 

--light provided by a cluster of 4 low-watt street-lamp-style globes and candles goes  for a sidewalk cafe, but it was just too dark.
--chicken gumbo uninteresting
--red beans and rice, no flavor
--jumbalaya a mound of bland rice with flecks of meat
--sausage very authentic with ground spicy bits of hooves and snouts, except I can still feel those bits, ew!
--crawdads are the only palatable dish, though it's not far from a Chinese all-you-can-eat buffet. 
--Spicy Mary made with Absolut Peppar and marinated asparagus. Don't miss it. 
--live low slow blues guitar and jazz styles missing the energy I wanted
--food also missing a kind of mischief I expect from this cuisine; I have to douse everything with Tabasco.

Baby kay's is a Phoenix stalward, having survived for at least 15 years, but probably longer. Am Missing something? Is Southern cooking just not interesting? I think not. I'll hav to pull out my old VCR tapes of that heavy French accent narrating Best Chefs of the World."}
{"text":"nothing to rave about this place.
service was poor and the food was bad.
I know, I shouldn't expect much on cajun food in phoenix. but I'm always up for an adventure."}
{"text":"I seriously don't see how this place has received such high ratings...Food was not at all what I was expecting. Husband got the po' boys half w/ gumbo which of course I picked at..not impressed. I had the clam and alligator basket which was overly fried to the max I was munching on basically crisps of what I hoped were the clams. I was expecting maybe Cajun fries? I mean being a Cajun restaurant would seem fitting right? Nope! Regular fat burger fries. We primarily came because we seen the very high reviews everyone gave the establishment for their food. The atmosphere was nice though and the music was good. Staff service was ehhh our server looked bored and he did the bare minimum as our server. I'd probably not come back..."}
{"text":"This place was sooooo delicious! I had the shrimp etoufee and catfish platter. My mom had a cup of gumbo and the catfish platter. The catfish were HUGE and fried to perfection. The shrimp etoufee was delicious and had nice, big whole shrimps. The gumbo was great! It had big pieces of spicy sausage and chicken. I'm definitely going back here"}
{"text":"If you like live music and cajun food, Baby Kay's is for you.  Bae ordered the cajun burger and said it is one of the best burgers he's had.  I tried it as well and it was tasty (they mix Andouille sausage with their ground beef).  I order the jambalaya and it was very good.  I like dipping the meat in the crawfish sauce.  Speaking of, Bae ordered a side of crawfish with the sauce.  He wanted to try the etouffee since we had an amazing one in Huntsville, we were hoping to find a good local dish.  The waiter suggested the side which is essentially the etouffee minus the rice.  It was good, more seafoody than the Huntsville version.  Neither of us are big on seafood but it was still good.  Overall, Baby Kay's had a cute (but wide open and well-lit) atmosphere with great music and good food.  Would recommend to anyone looking for some genuine cajun food here in the southwest."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in New Orleans and I have to say, the food here is the most authentic I've had anywhere outside of Louisiana. It was my first time here and I chose to try the Red Beans and Rice with sausage. It was like being home with every bite. I definitely recommend going here if you're from the South and are craving a bit of home sweet home. I can't wait to try all of the other items on their menu! I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant!!  The food is amazing, the service is wonderful....A++!
Try the Crawfish Étouffée and their green olive cole slaw!  Yummy!
Only wish you were still open in the uptown Phoenix area so I could go there for lunch!"}
{"text":"Baby Kay's Cajun Kitchen
2051 S Dobson Rd
Mesa, AZ 85202

I had not eaten at Baby Kay's since it was located at Town and Country Shopping Center a long time ago. It was time for a new review.

Companion and I arrived at lunch time and were seated immediately. Our waitress took our orders for drinks and provided the requisite menu's for us to peruse. Most of the food on the menu appeared to be authentic Nola, at least if the taste held up to the descriptions. 

Companion wasn't up on Cajun food, and asked if she could sample one or two things she was considering. Because heat from spice was not something companion enjoyed, she wanted to make sure she would be able to eat what she ordered. Our waitress promptly brought out 3 small cups with etouffee, jambalaya, and swamp water (gumbo for you northerners). Companion tasted all 3 and decided on the etouffee. I couldn't resist tasting them also. The jambalaya had some nice heat but no tomato in it, and the gumbo was true to tradition.

We each started with a cup of etouffee. We were brought plates with some excellent garlic bread on it along with a small bowl of the etouffee. Adding a bit of hot sauce to it and I was in New Orleans! A wonderful broth loaded with crawfish tails with a nice ball of white rice in the center. Companion ate her bowl without hot sauce and fell in love with it. This was the start of a wonderful lunch.

I got the combination basket which had fried shrimp and fried oysters in it along with the most unusual cole slaw I have ever eaten. There is no doubt in my mind that the chef who prepared this basket really knew what he was doing, as the shrimp and oysters were cooked to perfection. Companion had never eaten fried oysters before, and after one taste pronounced them delicious and decided to help me eat mine! The word thief comes to mind. The breading was perfect, and the oysters were a nice size and perfectly creamy. The shrimp, which most places overcook until they resemble something made from butyl rubber, were beautifully prepared, and were delicately tender. As for the cole slaw, what made it so unique is that it is prepared using green olives as one of the seasonings. It was highly unusual, and I still haven't made up my mind whether I like it or not. I'll probably have to go back a few more times to sample it some more.

We finished off lunch with their bread pudding in a puddle of whisky sauce. The bread pudding was dense, covered in pecans, and had coconut in it. I was so full that I could only eat a small amount of it, and companion asked for a box to take it in.

There was only one downer for the lunch, and that was a Sazerac that was ordered from the bar. Unfortunately, it just didn't make the grade and had to be sent back. My understanding is that they used to have a bartender that made a terrific one, and when she left they stopped making the drink. I'm hoping in the future they get a bartender that can make a proper Sazerac cocktail.

The place was clean, airy, with excellent service. Those who wish to can eat outside. Each table had a selection of hot sauces, mostly from Tabasco. I would suggest that they have some Louisiana Hot Sauce available also, as it has a totally different flavor than Tabasco. 

For those who might be inclined to say that this is an expensive place to eat, may I remind them that this is the desert and sea food has to be brought in and is also costly. It all adds up in the end.

4 Stars"}
{"text":"I used to make special trips to Town & Country Square-Biltmore to eat at Baby Kay's.  I was crushed when they disappeared.

OH MY ELATION!!  When I passed by on Dobson.  I Love their Gumbo!  I've had lots of their other dishes which are great as well.  I Love Their Gumbo!  Friendly Service.  And did I tell you, I Love Their Gumbo!"}
{"text":"We love Baby Kay's! My husband and I have been fans for over 25 years. Their Chicken Gumbo is to die for!
We were there last Saturday night, bit of a drive for us & we were so excited to be there but we were so disappointed in the ambiance. They had KSLX blasting, really?! I love rock n roll but there were commercials more than music on that station. And it's surprising they don't have Pandora or something. We asked them to turn it down especially so we could hear the live entertainment, but they didn't. The first waitress that seated us made a passive aggressive comment to us when we asked for a certain table rather than her first choice. The bright light was our new waiter started his shift with us as one of his tables. I forgot his name but he's new there. Great service and nice personality. We will go back, of course!"}

{"text":"The étouffée was really good as was the gumbo. Their wings weren't bad either. Only the Jambalaya was off. Too much black pepper. Not much in the way of ambience and its tucked away in a larger shopping center next to Trader Joes. I would come back again and have more étouffée...it is my favorite Cajun dish..."}

Each time I return home, I yearn for the food back in NOLA. Enter Baby Kay's- The best you're gonna get in AZ. Not everything is perfect, but the service is on point (Kyle was attentive and friendly) and the food and atmosphere brings me to the place I want to be. Very worth it!"}
{"text":"Oh baby! This place is great. We ordered our fried turkey from here and it was delicious. We were slightly nervous that the turkey might be drying but it was very moist/flavorful. My thanksgiving dinner was a hit. Definitely recommend this. 

I've also dined here as well. I've had their étouffée and the shrimp po boy. Yummy!! Uh to die for! 

I'll be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food! The shrimp etouffee was delicious, the green olive coleslaw was tasty, the garlic bread was fresh and hot, the catfish was quite possibly the best I ever had and the homemade bread pudding with whiskey sauce and pecans... just stunning. We asked for extra lemon and bread and they were there in less than a minute. 

This restaurant is a delight and one of my new favorites. I've been to New Orleans a number of times and this cajun restaurant met my expectations.

Only complaint is $2.40 for a soda."}
{"text":"Came in and got the shrimp etouffee & jambalaya combo. The etouffee has such a great flavor! I've been craving it ever since. It is Creamy and has a mild kick to it. If you aren't a veggie person you'll probably leave a lot behind (I did). But I think I'll still order it next time and get the bigger one so I can have my fill! The jambalaya was good. It was a drier version and kind of reminded me of some kind of creole fried rice. I enjoyed both but definitely recommend the etouffee!"}
{"text":"Laissez les bon temps rouler at Baby Kay's! I love cajun/Louisiana style cuisine and was excited to try out this restaurant based on the good reviews and close proximity to my house. The last time I had eaten Cajun food at a restaurant was actually in New Orleans. :) We ordered some hush puppies, boudin balls, I had the Cajun combination and shared some bread pudding.

The hush puppies and boudin balls were perfectly crispy on the outside, with tender filling. I loved the boudin balls. They tasted exactly like those I had in New Orleans. The Cajun combination was a great way to taste all the typical Louisiana style dishes. The crawfish etouffee was my favorite of the three bowls. The jambalaya was interesting in that it wasn't tomato based, so for me it tasted more like a Cajun spiced fried rice. Quite honestly I've had so many different versions of this dish (With a few that I've tried in Louisiana) it's still hard for me to say what a typical jambalaya is supposed to taste like. It tasted decent, but the rice was very slightly undercooked and thus very slightly crunchy tasting. I had the chicken and sausage gumbo which was flavorful and filled with meat and veggies. I tried my friend's seafood gumbo which was by far superior due to the smoky, intense flavor from the dark roux. I also loved the complimentary garlic bread which was buttery, garlicky, toasty heaven.

The bread pudding was a sizable chunk and came with a bowl of whiskey sauce (We asked for it on the side). It was thick, dense, and filled with a ton of ingredients such as nuts and shredded coconut. The sauce was very light and tasted more like very lightly sweet, watery whiskey.

Service was good and our drinks were filled as needed. Our waitress had the foresight to ask if we wanted separate checks or one single bill since we were a party of 6 which I appreciated. 

We went here on a Friday night and they had a musician singing and playing music, which might be a draw for some, but not so much if you are looking for more of a quiet environment where you can chat with friends. Good performance nonetheless by the musician.

I'll definitely come here if I'm craving Cajun style food for that lovely etouffee and seafood gumbo."}
{"text":"Tried Jambalaya,  Ettuffe,  Gunbo, and red beans n rice.   Truly a taste of New Orleans here.  Loved everything."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a hidden gem! This is the real deal Cajun. We had the Cajun Combo and the catfish dinner and both were amazing. It's all spicy, but just the right amount to enhance the flavors. Our server was great and brought us a tasting of the jambalaya, gumbo and étouffée to make sure we loved it. Overall great experience and they just gained two regulars!"}
{"text":"The best Cajun food in Arizona. My favorite is the crawfish étouffée. No other place make it better than Baby Kay's."}
{"text":"Went to Baby Kay's on a Friday evening. There was a 30 minute wait.

We ordered some hushpuppies for an appetizer. My wife ordered a 1/2 Oyster po-boy and gumbo and I orders the shrimp basket.

The hushpuppies came out with a horseradish sauce and ketchup. The hushpuppies were ok, kind of like Long John Silver's hushpuiies. The horseradish sause was excellent though.

The service this night was not very good. We waited almost 1 1/2 hours to get our entrees. The server steered clear of us most of the night, which made us angrier. If she would have communicated and offered a salad or something to tide us over, we would have understood.

We finally get our food and it is average at best. My wife's po-boy and gumbo were cold. My shrimp basket had 8 measly shrimp on it. We were really hoping for better, especially after the wait.

After our experience, we don't know how this place gets such good reviews.. food and service not good."}
{"text":"Best Cajun food this side of New Orleans!  Rivals even Bourbon Street. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Been coming over 8 years! Never disappointing! Love the staff! Love the Serena Combo!!!!!!
Always a comfort to come here and you have to have the Bourbon Sundae!!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Great food and friendly atmosphere. If you like southern cooking this place will hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great staff.
I just had a chicken salad but my husband had the Jambalaya, he said it was the best he had ever had.Had the bread pouding for dessert..fantastic! We wil certainly return."}
{"text":"Fair at best. I keep wishing for a great Creol/Cajun place here in town, but, sadly, have yet to find one that is good. 

The food lacked flavor and just was sort of eh. They need a recipe total overhaul/revamp and they'd be fine."}
{"text":"lulu wings were delicious. i had the catfish dinner with shrimp etouffee. delicious !!! loved the live music . wonderful place to enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"We've made this place a regular monthly stop in for dinner. Service is great, excellent cajun food. We have given up going to Pappadeaux. We prefer sitting at the bar on Friday nights and always get great service. Love their seafood gumbo and ettoufe. The cajun vinagrette dressing they serve is a special favorite of mine. I wish I could buy a bottle! Only disappointment is they are not open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Had an itch for Jambalaya and based on reviews this was the place for it. 
Service and environment were ok, nothing special but also not bad. 
We ended up ordering seafood Gumbo (crab, crawfish, shrimp) & crawfish étouffée. 
Both were very very fishy. I had a hard time eating the Gumbo and only had a taste of the étouffée. I basically had to gag it down. Luckily it was served with garlic bread that was really good, and it helped the gumbo go down. 
I will not be  returning nor will I recommend this place."}
{"text":"The jambalaya and seafood gumbo were excellent, and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience! Great food and service! Had the gumbo and catfish with the  ettoufee!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, good service, perfect amount of heat. Seafood Gumbo and the shrimp and catfish po boy was to die for. I also liked that I was curious about several items on the menu and the server even offered to give me a sample. One of which was the etoufee that alone will make me come back next time to try that."}
{"text":"Omg, I am in Cajun heaven. So how did I end up her...well, I've passed by this place several time. It used to be called Cajun Kitchen. One day I stopped in after I was craving some good Cajun food and the place was shut down. Well my craving came back and noticed this Cajun place was back in the same spot but under a different name. Shout out to Kate M.!! I read her review and I was salivating of all the nice things she had to say about this place and the photos she posted so I had to give it a try. 

When we first walked in I noticed the music they were placing and it definitely gave it a Louisiana feel. The place isn't very big but comfortably spaced so you don't feel like you will smack the person behind you if you turn around too quick. We were immediately greeted by hostess who seated us in a nice location so that we could get a good view of the rest of the place since this was my first time here. We ordered cup of chicken gumbo as I was so eager to satisfy my Cajun craving.  Didn't take too long and the food came with a side of their succulent garlic bread. Gumbo was super good and I wish I would have ordered the bowl but I didn't want to get too full because there were so many other things I wanted to try. I ended up ordering the shrimp etouffee which was good but it had an overwhelming amount of onions. I can definitely say I will be back to try other things on the menu but gumbo is a must. 

Great fast service and great place for Cajun food."}
{"text":"New (second or temporary location) for this Cajun restaurant. Came to Mesa to try it out, we ordered the catfish dinner with crawfish sauce and a half poboy & cup of seafood gumbo. (All seafood due to Ash Wednesday, wish I made it here last night )  The crawfish étouffée atop the catfish was amazing, perfect texture and flavor, I then took a bite, crispy and spicy on the outside, moist and delicious on the inside.  I don't think i have had better (except blackened, blackened is better heh) .  The gumbo was great as well, the right amount of spice, i was so missing the andouille sausage, but lent."}
{"text":"We showed up on a Friday evening just before it got really busy. Our server was extremely friendly and even brought us a sample of the Cajun Combination which I ordered. It was delicious! I highly recommend this place for great Cajun food and a lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yo this place was LIT ya'll. I literally felt like I was on Bourbon Street in NOLA. The food here tastes very similar to what is found in NOLA and they kept the entire menu creole/Cajun. They didn't try to put a southwest spin on the flavor. I got the fried catfish and got the wings are appetizers. The service isn't bad either but its almost like a tv series. It starts off slow but then it takes off. The best part was the live music played by someone who know how to play an electric guitar and blues music."}
{"text":"I don't know why it took me so long to come here. They have been here for decades. My experience was really awesome. The food was delicious. 
There was this older gentleman on the stage singing great tunes. Nice touch.
It was my first time here and the server caught on to that and told me she would bring me samples of (3things) which i thought was awesome. From that i was able to decide what to order.
I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is where you want to be for authentic Cajun food and great atmosphere all while feeling like you're getting your money's worth when the check comes. 

Growing up in Louisiana, I was spoiled with great cooking. I always leave disappointed from places like Pappadeaux's. Way too much money for too little spice and too many tables crammed together.

Baby Kay's feels like home. The ambience and food are spot on. More than worth the price."}
{"text":"We loved this place! We assumed it was going to be busy on a Saturday evening so we called in a reservation. However, although they had a steady business, it was not crowded at all...which is a darn shame! 

 I ordered the cajun combination which has gumbo, jambalaya, and crawfish etouffee. It was amazing!!! Fresh, tasty, with just the right amount of cajun kick.  Our server was great (thank you Leslie) and service was very fast! 

There was a gentleman in the corner playing blues guitar which added to the relaxed atmosphere. We have nothing bad to say about Baby Kay's. We recommend it to everyone and we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool!  I had no idea this hidden gem was tucked away in a strip mall!  My friends and I opted for outdoor patio seating since it was such a nice evening out.  I recommend taking that route whenever possible.

The food was great!  My friends and I opted for the sampler appetizer and a combo platter and the shrimp special for dinner.  DO NOT leave without having some sweet potato pie!  Everything tasted great!  I'd love to see some different wines on their menu - maybe a good Australian Sauv Blanc or some good white blends to pair with the spiciness of the food but the Melbec that we had was just fine.

And I was impressed that one of the OWNERS was in the trenches working with the staff!  I forgot to mention my check-in deal when the check arrived but that's totally my fault.  I told the owner in the beginning of the meal and said I'd show her again when the check came.   Don't do that.

I will definitely return - most likely with my Dad, he would like a place with such authentic Cajun food!"}
{"text":"While Baby Kays's seems like a misplacement in the valley, the food takes me back to my favorite New Orleans memories.  The plates are large and so are the flavors but you will not walk out disappointed. I loved the confluence of local Mexican art in creole culture and I have yet to buy some art to put on my walls at home.  Overall a solid 5. I would definitely go back in the future."}
{"text":"As a native of New Orleans, LA, born and raised in Uptown, this place right here is THE real deal. I ordered food here today for my fiancé and I, and the food was spectacular. 

We ordered the Cajun combo, two catfish poboys dressed, and bread pudding. 
First, the Cajun combo: we substituted the gumbo for red beans and rice, and had the crawfish étouffée and jambalaya. ALL VERY GOOD! I felt like I was eating good home cooked food.

Next the catfish poboys: these were great, really enjoyed mine. The cheese was different than what I'm used to having on a poboy, but it was still good none the less.

Last, the bread pudding: loved it. Bread pudding is my favorite dessert- hands down. The whiskey sauce for the bread pudding came on the side; however, I opted to forgo putting it on the dessert because I don't like whiskey (and it had a strong whiskey taste), and the bread pudding was amazing without it! 

Overall, the service was good, the lady at the bar was very friendly, the atmosphere felt like I was somewhere relaxing on magazine street- I felt like I was back in my hometown. 
I can definitely say any feelings of being homesick, disappeared once I walked inside Baby Kay's, so I'll definitely be ordering from here/ dining here again, and I'll be recommending it to other people."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with the wife for lunch. The food here is fantastic! I had the sampler, and all three items were outstanding, especially the Seafood Etoufee! Heaven in a bowl! My wife had the \"Seafood Burger\" which is basically a crabcake sandwich. It was delicious and the crabcake was really a good size! no skimping on the portions here. We both left feeling quite full, and thought the price was very reasonable for the quality and portion sizes. Also try the Abita Turbo Dog beer. Dark and nutty. Holds up well to the spiciness of the food.
The only thing I felt was lacking was the music. They had regular light rock playing at a nice sound level, but I think the should have had some Zydeco and Jazz playing to add a little New Orleans flair.
Overall a great place for lunch. Can't wait to try it for dinner!"}
{"text":"We dined here as part of a large party and had buffet style price fixed option.  Food was terrible and not anything resembling Cajun.  I would not return if they were giviing it away for free."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere, friendly staff. I had the Shrimp Po' Boy, and it was terrific. The prices were good for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I literally felt like I was in New Orleans! The alligator/clam basket was the best! I'm glad I found this hidden gem in Mesa, AZ. Will definitely be coming back for sure. Thank y'all!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has amazing food wonderful specials and I'm here on Election night and they actually give a discount because I voted"}
{"text":"First but not last time at Baby Kay's enjoying great Cajun food. Had the wings followed by catfish covered in crawfish Étouffée, garlic bread, and jambalaya all while listening to a live soul-blues musician. Ambiance was way more quaint and personal than I expected from a strip mall location. Kyle our server made excellent recommendations and remained attentive without being overbearing. Can't wait for the craw-fish to come in or Thursday chicken fry."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years...through all the owners.  Always great food and the service is consistently good.  One of my top 5 places to eat in Phoenix.  Twin sisters own the place now and they know how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"\"Baby, how it eat?\" GOOD. DELICIOUS. I'm Nola blood and it is very hard to find a meal that taste like a New Orleans native cooked it! Eating anywhere is Arizona, or anywhere outside of New Orleans for that matter, I don't expect much. I usually expect for something to be called one thing but be another (like in flagstaff I got a \"crab cake poboy\" but it came on a brioche bun! What the heck!!). Here at Baby Kay's, I got crawfish étouffée and a shrimp poboy. Baby, it taste just like home! I was in shock and wished I didn't order half orders. Best creole food in AZ hands down.  two thumbs up from me!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice with live music. The decorations were reminisince of a party city Mardi Gras but some of it works. Didn't order any drinks, but the bar had a nice atmosphere. 
Tonight we ordered the Cajun combination and the Cornish game hen. We got the duck and saugage gumbo which was too salty and had a definite kick. The jambalaya was different without the tomato base, but the chicken and sausage added great flavor to the rice. The crawfish etoufee was on point! There was plenty of crawfish and the flavor was remincince of a clam chowder. The Cornish game hen was fried nicely with crispy skin, but overly salty at some points if you got too much skin."}
{"text":"This place is too delicious!!!!

I've been here twice, and I get the three combo plate that comes with the ettouffe, jumbalaya, sausage gumbo or seafood gumbo and potato salad. I love the ettouffe, it's the reason I come here, and the jumbalaya. Everything was just really fantastic, the food and the service!"}
{"text":"I'm always thrilled with the experience of checking out different Cajun restaurants. It always makes for a good time, because it's a great excuse to assemble a group and multiple drinks with dinner are de rigeur. My experience at Baby Kay's was just such an occasion, as I joined friends for Cajun food and crawfish (served on Wednesdays at Baby K's).

The overall experience was wonderful. Abita beers on tap, good variety of choices on the menu. Having lived in Louisiana for seven years (although in the notoriously non-Cajun predominantly Scotch-Irish region known as Shreveport), I got to ply my expertise and educate my friends on what they were stuffing down their collective gullet.

The crawfish here were disappointing. I don't know if it was because they were boiled forever or not kept alive before boiling, but the tail meat on many of them were mushy. And the shells were hard to shuck since they were so flimsy. Something was amiss. The novelty value was there, but they were actually pretty unpalatable. I did get a thrill out of discovering deep-fried boudin (pronounced \"boo-dan\") balls, which were tasty, even though the portion was somewhat meager. I shared this pork-and-liver-and-rice specialty with my friends who promptly uttered yummy sounds.

A good time was had by all. Service was friendly and attentive, but in my opinion, the food was a bit overpriced. I give them props for providing a decent Cajun dining experience, but the menu could use a little tweaking and they need to bring up their crawfish game. I'll be back for the ambience and appetizers sometime, just to relive a little Louisiana experience, and maybe suck down a few Turbo Dogs (that's my Abita beer of choice)."}
{"text":"Delicious and large portions.   I had the dirty rice and crawfish etouffee.  My husband had the catfish and my daughter had the jambalaya.  None of us could finish our dinners but they were all excellent."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewer's about Baby Kay's.  It's good, but it's not outstanding.  I think it's a fun place to come when you're tired of the standard Italian or Mexican, and I've always had great service here- so no complaints there.

I've tried the hush puppies, spinach and artichoke dip, and the Louisiana crab cakes for appetizers- all pretty good.  And for the main dish, I've had the vegetarian etouffee, catfish and the catfish po-boy.  The entre's are pretty big because they come with garlic bread, a baked potato and salad if my memory has held up.

If you've never tried this place, I recommend going and seeing what you think.  The food is tasty enough and it's a fun spot.  They have live jazz music on the weekends too! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to grab some tasty jambalaya, étouffée, and gumbo.  Service was great and the food came out quick.  Expect to pay around 20 bucks for a meal, but well worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service even on a busy Saturday night. We had the Shrimp Etoufee & Red Beans & Rice. Try the green olive Cole slaw - it will make you crave more. Can't wait to go back to try something else!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise!  Enjoyed the food. Great service and cool ambience  little one man sax  playing. Great date night!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch. Dinner is great also, I just live to far away.

Been coming here since 1994!

I lunch here once a week usually.

I have to drive in from Maricopa now!"}
{"text":"Seafood etoufee was good.  Guitar player was fantastic.  Waitress was very nice and helpful.  Service was good.

The Jambalaya and gumbo were ok.  Fried oysters were ok.  The potato salad was ok.  The atmosphere was ok.

All in all, an ok Cajun dining experience.  I'd use more adjectives but they didn't really spring to mind or tongue.  It didn't knock my socks off but it did scratch the itch."}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to NOLA you will find in this city.

Everything they serve is good, the catfish, the etoufee, gumbo, jambalaya, you name it.

The lunch specials are fantastic, try the seafood enchiladas on Tuesday.

I can't believe I'm going to post this here because I don't like competition when it comes ot getting my order (they run out), but they have a crawfish boil on Wednesday night, it is AWESOME.

I have friends who are from LA and they swear by this place.  I am new but a dedicated fan.

If you don't like this place, you probably don't like this kind of food or you are just a weirdo.  Anyone who gave it less than 4 stars must be from the 70s because they are on ludes."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm no expert in Cajun cuisine but this place is great. We got the sampler seafood app and shared the combo plate that came with jambalaya, gumbo and seafood étouffée and homemade coleslaw on the side.  All was great but the étouffée was delish! Creamy with excellent hints of spices and chunks of shrimp, catfish, etc. 

We will definitely come back again and try out the rest of the menu. 

Staff is friendly and service was fast."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I gave baby Kay's a chance. I am from Louisiana and I am usually highly critical of Cajun/creole cooking. I was pleasantly surprised. The hush puppies were delish, not greasy at all. The etouffee was very well seasoned and the lulu  LuLu wings are a winner for sure. I am going to be heading back on one of the live music nights so I can get the full experience."}
{"text":"We stumbled in here by accident, but as Bob Ross says, \"there are no mistakes, only happy little accidents\". I haven't had much experience other then the occasionally taste testing of a friend's jambalaya, but I throughly enjoyed this place. 

I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo (lol not very Cajun-y) but it had a little \"Cajun kick\" to it. It was a huge bowl for only $10~ and I definitely had enough for leftovers. It was a tad spicy  and it was delicious!

Friends got the gumbo and jambalaya combos and they loved there food as well. 
Bonus: they have our complimentary garlic bread!"}
{"text":"If you want good Cajun food come to Baby Kays. I have been here multiple times, and enjoyed every meal from them. 
Lulus wings
Hush Puppies
Crab cakes
Boudin Balls
Gumbo (chicken & seafood)
Catfish PoBoy
Crawfish Etouffee
We highly recommend Baby Kays"}
{"text":"Service and food were exceptional. Brought my foodie friends from Virginia and they were in heaven. Always love coming here for great food and friendly efficient service b"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Cajun food. If you're looking for an authentic place this is where you need to go. Even have live music."}
{"text":"Their catfish dinner with crawfish sauce is bomb! But we always come in large parties and that is always a problem for them to handle with the food and bills when we need them split."}
{"text":"By far my favorite  restaurant  in the east valley. Great Cajun cuisine every time! Seafood gumbo is my go to dish of choice. The pork chop Fiday night special is amazing, thick tender and smothered  in brown gravy. The boudin balls with the spicy jelly are a great combo of spice and sweet. Happy hr.  from 4-6 has great affordable snacks . Service is excellent and the weekend blues guitar provides a bit of NO flavor."}
{"text":"Did you know there is live music at Baby Kays? A guy in the corner playing blues guitar. I only just noticed him on my last visit. I've been there a few times in the last few years. I thought it was a CD playing.  I had taken the music for granted without really paying attention to the sounds of fingers scratching across strings, feet tapping on the floor--the other accents that separate real from Memorex..

Maybe that's fitting. I think Baby Kay's has been taken for granted for years now. I remember when it rolled into the valley on a faddish wave of Cajun corn and blackened everything. The endurance of this one place tells you that something about it was more right than the other business that were claimed by time, recessions and the fickleness of the public.

Whatever others might say, I think this place has about the best shrimp etouffe and dirty rice you're going to find in the valley. The central location and laid-back vibe are bonuses."}
{"text":"This place has been around a long time, and I've been there quite a few times. It's hard to find decent Cajun food in Phoenix, but Kay's usually does pretty well.

Our last visit wasn't the greatest. The duck & andouille gumbo was nice, if not quite piping hot. I forgave that, as it's one of the few places around you cna find duck of any kind, or andouille for that matter. The shrimp etouffe came out stone cold, and the waitress quickly returned it to the kitchen where they nuked it to almost hot. Microwaved etouffee just isn't right. 

An order of dirty rice with a side of 2 links of andouille proved almost pointless, as we specifically made clear this was an entree, and expected the 2 links to be cut up and added to the rice. What we got was a small bowl of dirty rice with two tiny breakfast-sized links laid atop it.  

The crab cakes weren't bad, being mostly crab with little bread crumbs, but they really didn't scream authentic cajun cakes to me. Plus, they too were a bit on the cold side - even though everything came out quickly. 

On the plus side, they have Abita beers on tap. Turbo Dog is always welcomed - especially if it's on tap. 

Another plus is you can stop in on a weekend night (we went on a Saturday) even at 9p and they are open. The place was empty barring a few people at the bar. That should be your clue. 

My previous experiences here were all around lunchtime, with no problems as far as food temp, so I suspect that late night diners are getting food that has been sitting around in a steamer all day long. 

Regardless, I am only giving this 2 stars. Your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"Having recently relocated from the North Valley to Fountain Hills, we had to find some new places to eat! We were introduced to Baby Kay's by good friends a few months ago and we just can't get enough!!

Our journey began with the Boudin Balls - amazing sausage croquette style appetizers with HEATED apricot jam. WOW! The jam itself is something I had to get the recipe for! The cup of Seafood Gumbo was large enough for me to split with my hubby - and the flavors were amazing! Crawfish Etouffee was a great base for the fried shrimp dinner! 
Hubby ordered the Fried Chicken (Special on Thursdays) and the seasoning was hot and flavorful - crispy as always! I tried a friend's catfish & was pleasantly surprised - since I'm not a fish eater - it was pretty good! 
Dessert - well that HUGE Chocolate Bourbon Sundae was shared by all 4 of us!

Before I finish I MUST mention the drinks! Try one of the house specials - they hit a home run with them every time! Bring s designated driver - because they pack a PUNCH! 
A special p.s. to our waiter most nights - Martine' (pronounced Marteeen) BEST SERVICE EVER!! Consistent quality, service and so far not one bad experience. Need I say the place is spotless, funky, jazzy in a New Orleans way - OK I just did! BonAppetite!! Our FAVORITE PLACE ! Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This past weekend while the family was at Spring Training,our son talked us out of going to our spot going to our they we frequent in Arizona. And the family were glad he did. The food and environment was great. Our server suggested the wings as a appetizer and it was a tasty suggestion. Every one enjoyed their dish. And we can wait to go back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here with the family tonight. WOW! Everything was amazing! We started with the sampler, it had catfish shrimp fried oysters qnd jalapeño poppers, yum. The star of the night was the crawfish etouffee...AMAZEBALLS! Some of the best I have ever had, and yes that includes New Orleans. Also tried the fried catfish with crawfish sauce and again, Amazing!  Sorry for sounding all excited but it has been so long since I've had great cajun food. Only down side was service was a little slow, but it was a Friday so that is understandable. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I have been there twice and enjoyed the food both times. First time there I had the Shrimp Boil. VERY Cajun (spicy) but very good. Second visit I had the Crawfish Boil which was excellent. The other person in my party had the Crawfish Etoufee which he said was very good. The service is a little slow but all the wait staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Outstanding seafood gumbo and green olive coleslaw. Have had the seafood enchiladas as well.. excellent cajun choice."}
{"text":"I used to go to the old location where they had a rockin etouffee. 
Unfortunately, I either walked into the wrong place or they are not making the same quality stuff anymore. 
The \"étouffée\" I ordered was very much like a watered-down version of the filling in a Stouffers chicken pot pie - no pepper or spice of any kind and certainly no roux.  Then there were like 6-7 really puny shrimp buried in this mysterious liquid and the whole thing had this nasty old restaurant smell. It seemed really old. 
I felt really ripped off by the $16.95 price & kept wondering if I had stumbled into an episode of Kitchen Nighmares! 
I hope the rest of their food is better, but I would never go near that pseudo-etoufee again."}
{"text":"So glad a Cajun restaurant opened up in the old location with a much improved quality and menu. Tops for fast Cajun meals."}
{"text":"For a quick lunch I order the half catfish po-boy with a side of potato salad and seafood gumbo. The food was OK, the sandwich was the only thing I finished. The potato salad didn't have much flavor and just tasted bland. 

I thought it was expensive for a lunch meal. I paid $16 total and ordered water because I do not drink soda. I haven't been back because I am a fan of good prices almost everything on the menu was over $11 even for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Unreal Cajun food. Best in town so far, by far.


Service was kinda shitty. Especially considering we went at 2pm and there were like 6 people working.


The food however is off the chains."}
{"text":"Being a Cajun - decided to try out this place and I am so glad I did!  The food is so very spicy and yummy.  If you are a fellow Cajun (or someone who likes good and spicy dishes) I  STRONGLY recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"The dirty rice and boudin at Baby Kay's are really quite wonderful - a local treasure in Phoenix. Baby Kay's and Papadeaux's take the prize for Cajun restaurants so far in Phoenix, with good food at reasonable prices. The lunch is a little pricier here - and so I recommend Baby Kay's for dinner because it's the same price. But hey if Greekfest across the street is full for lunch, pop over to Baby Kay's. The food is consisistently good - gumbo, jambalaya and oyster po-boy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Made my second visit to Baby Kay's. I was just as pleased as the first time.  Tried the lulu wings and they were amazing,  bursting with flavor.  I also got a combo this time trying 3 of the Cajun staples,  jambalaya, etoufee, and gumbo.  I really liked all three and glad they were distinct in their own way.  I like the potato salad more than the coleslaw, I was expecting a more zingy flavor with the green olives.. my boyfriend likes the seafood basket with oysters and catfish. He ordered it again with the dirty rice which was flavorful as well.  

Definitely suggest getting the pain killer, be careful it can be a sneaky one. 

Service was great both times.  The waitress we had last night was vey helpful and patience that goes a long way in my book.  

I guess po' boys will be next and of course an order of lulu wings ( I think I'm hooked)"}
{"text":"Great food. We had the Boudin balls, and crab cakes appetizers great and spicy. The fried Cornish game hens were magnificent."}
{"text":"We looked for Gumbo and found this place. Gumbo is awesome! I went there twice in two weeks!! I had Chicken Gumbo (light taste), Sliders and Jambalaya. My boyfriend had Duck & Andouille Sausage Gumbo (thick taste) and 1/2 Po'Boys. Let's soak garlic bread in Gumbo and enjoy them!"}
{"text":"So I am heading to NOLA for a vacation next week and no better way to prep for the mouth orgasm I'm about to have then head to Baby Kay's.  For the Phoenix Valley this has to be the best Cajun food around.  

I ordered the Cajun combination which is a cup of each: Seafood Gumbo, Crawfish Etouffee, and sausage jambalaya.  Also on the side you get garlic bread and potato salad.  

The Seafood Gumbo was the only one I didn't enjoy it was just ok nothing like I thought it was going to be.  I should have taken the downgraded chicken gumbo.  

The Crawfish Etouffee was awesome it was the best of the three.  It was full of flavor and just yummy.  I think next time I will order just that alone.  

The Jambalaya was good but after the Etouffee it unfortunately was judged unfairly :).  It did have huge chunks of great sausage and tasted good.  

They tried to sell me on dessert but I was so stuffed I didn't even finish my side of potato salad.  3 cups of food actually is a lot more than it sounds like.  

I will be back for sure as this place is a true gem and they have Abita beer which always scores points in my book."}
{"text":"Best Cajun food in town, plus a full bar and live entertainment on the weekends. Great service too. A bunch of us do lunch every Wednesday and that works out just right, because the Wednesday lunch special is a killer \"Bayou Baked Potato\" and that, just now, made my mouth water only saying it."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to New Orleans and have therefore been spoiled by actual cajun food, this place is a guaranteed disappointment. My $12 shrimp po'boy had maybe 10 shrimp on it, something that is supposed to be a staple of cajun cuisine. The couple of small pickles, half of a tomato slice and soggy lettuce given as dressings for the sandwich were an embarrassment. I'm not sure what flavor the chips were, because there was no flavor. I think I could have had better at Long John Silver's, and I hate Long John Silver's."}
{"text":"We were able to enjoy  patio seating on a nice spring night here at Baby Kay's.  Tucked into a nice strip mall area near several other restaurants, boutique shops and Trader Joe's it can also make for a fun outing.   The food here was authentic and flavorful.  The food was spicy but not so much as to loose touch with the flavor of it all.  I could have made a meal out of the seafood gumbo alone but got the 2 item that came with red beans and rice ( I barely touched it I was so full).  My friend got a three item combo and while the portions looked meagar, they filled him up and he was quite pleased.  We didn't quite know what to expect with the green olive coleslaw when we saw it as an option but if you are a green olive fan you will enjoy the mix of tart briney sliced green pimento stuffed olives with the slaw.  I would have liked to try the oyster po' boy, I will have to go back just for that and the slaw."}
{"text":"Super yummy !!  Started with étouffée.  Now I try the wings and the barbecue pork sliders."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try out this restaurant because the reviews seem to be very strong but needless to say I was a bit disappointed.  

The service was OK ( our waitress could have been a little bit more personable) . She did her job but definitely was not as welcoming or outgoing as I was expecting 

The  food was not as good as I was hoping for after reading the reviews  ( the garlic bread served with our appetizer and meal was definitely old and stale  ( I swear it must have been frozen and microwaved ) . I did like the crawfish étouffée but felt like the gumbo was very watery and the jambalaya I ordered was mainly white rice .... All in all - I felt my experience and  the food was not as outstanding as i had hoped."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love Cajun food, especially Etouffee. We have been going to another Cajun restaurant for our etouffee fix for years and since we moved to Mesa we decided to give this a try.
First of all, they have a great happy hour specials. We ordered the crawfish etouffe and the fried shrimp appetizer from the menu. WOW WOW!! We truly did enjoy each of the entrees. There is a reason why this restaurant still attracts great clientele.
We will definitely be coming back for more of our Cajun fix.
Thank you Baby Kay's!"}
{"text":"After driving by numerous times we finally stopped in. I got the Cajun combo with etoufee, gumbo, and jambalaya. While all were good, next time I will get the etoufee! It was rich and creamy with just enough spice!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Louisiana for two years, overall I wasn't impressed with the food, atmosphere, etc. overall.  Maybe it's in a good location, but it wasn't visible from the road (or not as far as I could see).  The restaurant was randomly decorated with \"cajun\" propaganda, posters, and articles.  One article on the wall was about New York City and didn't fit in at all.  

My friend and I ordered the house wine and it was decent, but I guess you get what you pay for.  Also, we ordered the spinach-artichoke dip for an appetizer with garlic bread; I can't complain about that dish.  For dinner, I got the Baby Kay's special with red beans and rice and seafood gumbo.  I enjoyed the gumbo because it had crawfish in it and the red beans and rice was okay, too.  I was going to order the crawfish etoufee, but it was $18.25, when the other entree was $11.25, and I had spent a lot on my vacation.  A green olive coleslaw was included with the entree, but it contained a lot of mayo, and I didn't eat any more than one bite.  That was kind of my fault, though, for ordering coleslaw. 

i thought the decor was really dated and the waitress/bussers asked me like five times if I was done with my gumbo, which I was not.  

Good cajun food is hard to find beyond the bayou."}
{"text":"Incredible food, great service, great prices! The side salad was fresh, cold and     a great value.  I had the shrimp etufe and it was amazing. Spices were perfect, portion size was good (having the 2nd half for lunch and it's even better). Drink menu was good- had an Irish Mule- and my husband had a Hurricane. Only disappointing thing was the bread pudding and mostly because it wasn't what I was expecting. Dense and flavorful but somewhat dry. Will get the bourbon sundae next time. Great experience- I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my folks and g/f. Having already read previous yelpers i already knew what to try and what i wanted.

The seafood gumbo was very good as was the chicken and sausage gumbo. I enjoyed a cold Turbodog along with my meal that paired fairly well with the spices from the sausage. My dad was a little disappointed that they were out of oysters for his po'boy but he claimed he was happy with the catfish po'boy in the end. Enoyed the live blues music while dining and having a good time.

All in all expect rather slow service but better than most cajun food in phoenix. Would eat here again in the future."}
{"text":"Authentic Cajun Food!  Who needs fancy when you can get real Gumbo, Jambalaya, Pooh Boys, Etouffee, Andouillee, etc."}
{"text":"I guess if I had never enjoyed GOOD cajun food *cough* Baseline/Price *cough* previously, or never enjoyed it at all, this place would get 3.5 stars, maybe 4, but that world does not exist for me in this current plane of reality.  Really, this is 2.5 stars, but there is no way to give a 1/2 star.

Gumbo was meh.  Decent taste but the rue was not fantastic and frankly kind of oily.  Red Beans and Rice were boooooring and the only thing that saved it was the sausage.  Potato salad was also meh and didn't leave any great impression.  

Price was on par with other cajun spots.  If you think this is excellent cajun food, well, \"shame on you\".  :D"}
{"text":"If you want to experience NOLA (New Orleans Louisiana) then this is your place to go! Nice size portions and yummy alcoholic beverages! The staff are friendly."}
{"text":"The only time I ever had \"cajun\" food before I went to Baby Kay's last week was when I was at Disneyland...and I was not impressed with Disneyland's version of \"cajun\" (Sorry, Walt! Love the rest of the place). I went with three friends from work last week, and it was just fabulous all-around. I'm not a big fan of a lot of spice, but Baby Kay's does a good job not completely overwhelming their food with so much spice you can't taste anything but. I had the catfish with court bouillon sauce. The fish was definitely fresh, breaded with something heavenly and light, and you get a filet and a half...of the biggest catfish I've ever seen. There's spice in the breading, but it's SO good...the sauce is nice, too! When you go, you really need a Hurricane...oh, my! And if you like ice cream, go for the bourbon chocolate sundae dessert. I didn't even need the ice cream...the sauce was so good I could have eaten it by itself! Definitely a must-go-to place!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty authentic. The gumbo was delicious. The service was really slow as I think it was only 1 server working . He was very polite. Food was good. I would go back."}
{"text":"We went to this place based on reviews. I am highly upset the food and customer service. It took at least 15 minutes to get drinks.  When they brought out my fiance  wings he thought they were the breaded ones (it's our first time there) we were told \"well why didn't you order the other ones\" I found that so rude and disrespectful.  Horrible customer services.  We askes for the other wings were told they would be brought out.... never where. Our sides were cold and catfish was salty!! Let's not mention they never brought out my fiance poptato salad until I mentioned it when i was paying. I will for sure never go back there, defienty not after the customer service."}
{"text":"We tried the Cajun combo with seafood gumbo, and the Thursday fried chicken special.  This was a TON of food, and everything was delicious.  I don't know much about Cajun food specifically, but I was pleased with my takeout experience.  The woman who took my phone order was also very helpful in finding me good menu options."}
{"text":"Went to Baby Kay's in Mesa on 01/08/2015 with my wife.  The following is what was ordered:

We ordered the following:

1) A Cup of Seafood Gumbo
2) One Cajun Combination (seafood gumbo, jambalaya, and crawfish etoufee)

Most of it was okay, except for the following:

The gumbo was too salty.  My wife even said it was too salty.  Also, the seafood and crawfish did not taste fresh enough.  

Otherwise it was okay.  My wife's comment was, \"She has had better Cajun food in Chicago, and elsewhere.\" 

The food was okay though."}
{"text":"Super delicious crawfish etoufee, jumbalaya and gumbo."}
{"text":"Oyster po'boy, bitches!  Thick, juicy hunks of oyster, lightly battered and fried, then put on a toasted hoagie roll.  Served with homemade potato chips, a pile of sweet pickle slices and a side of the remoulade sauce.  The sauce is what makes it!  It's a horseradish sauce and yummy!  I poured a bit of it over my sandwich.  It's obviously the specialty of the house, because our server asked each of us if we wanted it on the side.
Oysters were big, juicy and firm, not too much so, though.  Nothing like oysters that aren't edible.  I've had them elsewhere and it's really disgusting.
I just burped and it tasted like the po'boy.  All the boys at work are jealous."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend Baby Kay's. I've tried to like it but I am always disappointed by the food, despite others' aplomb. I'm from New Orleans and have dined at the Crescent City's fine Cajun and Creole restaurants, so I know what good Cajun and Creole food is. Unfortunately, Baby Kay's falls short of what good, classic Cajun and Creole food should be.

I feel sad writing this review because I do not want people to be turned away from Cajun and Creole food, but I feel very sad that, for many people, Baby Kay's will be their only taste of the bayou."}
{"text":"I alwaus get the Baby K sampler all and still go home with food. I love the oysters most of all and the food is seasoned well."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite local spots. I got take-out here once a year or so ago, but wanting to use our Entertainment book coupons, we came twice recently. We dined in the last two times and really enjoyed our meals. The service is attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is very chill and low-key. Last night (Thursday), there was a blues performer alternating between his violin and guitar. 

I have been to New Orleans many times and having lived in the Florida panhandle, I love, love LOVE, anything with crawfish. Boy, do they do it right with their crawfish etouffee! Fair warning that their food can be spicy but that is typical with that food genre. I have had their seafood gumbo (chunky, spicy goodness), jambalaya, fried catfish, fried shrimp....everything is very good. I particularly love their hushpuppies with the spicy remoulade sauce. You can tell it has a lot of horseradish in it, which I love. 

They also have great mixed drinks (my favorite is the Creamsicle) and they have a good selection of Louisiana beers. I honestly think this restaurant is a great representation of Cajun style food and feel lucky to have it my hood!"}
{"text":"I just have to give Baby Kay's more words.  This food is just awesome.  The Étouffée is to die for, you'll be hard pressed to find its equal in New Orleans, and I've tried!  They deliver consistant high quality food, I'm always super impressed with their Lulu wings.  They're breaded, fried and tossed in a fantastic sweet spicy sauce.  The wings themselves are also of high quality, I've never found any place in the valley that serves wings with so much meat on them, they aren't sacrificing quality to provide a reasonable price happy hour here.

I also recommend happy hour for the sampling of so many good things, split a cup of chicken gumbo or a cup of Étouffée and some of the sliders.  Everything is palate pleasing.  Don't forget dessert, get the chocolate bourbon sunday.  And make sure you're splitting it at least 4 ways, its massive and super sweet!

We are also ice tea people, some places get it right and some don't, its the good stuff here.  Doesn't have to be flashy to compliment a good meal!  The staff is also great, they really seem to care and somehow even import a little of that New Orleans charm (if ya know what I mean)."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for some good gumbo around the valley and found baby Kay's on yelp. It was quite a drive for us coming from the west valley, but totally worth it! We had the chicken and sausage gumbo and pork po boy with sweet potato fries. The gumbo was well seasoned and had a great kick to it; both the chicken and sausage were tender. Po boy was delicious and so were the fries. Dessert looked absolutely delicious and massive, but we were way too full after dinner to try some! Will definitely have to save room next time. Portions were decently sized, especially if you're splitting two dishes it's more than enough to leave you feeling full and satisfied. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this little place. Super Friendly staff in a great location. I was even drawn in by the clientele; I encountered several regulars as I waited for my order. All raved about the food and recommended several dishes. Well this was my cheat day and what better food to cheat with...fried. I tried the catfish and shrimp. It was just ok. There wasn't much fish to the fish, more batter. The shrimp was only slightly better. Could have been seasoned a bit better so on my next visit, I'll be trying something different."}
{"text":"This is the go to place. When the group can't decide where to go for lunch this is the one place we can all agree on. Fun friendly service and really good food. Don't miss this if you are near the Biltmore. Make sure you try the green olive slaw!"}
{"text":"The crawfish etoufee is unparallel to any I've ever had. I will keep going back as long as they keep serving this dish. The wings are dynamite as well."}
{"text":"Baby Kay's was an experience as much as a wonderful meal. There was live music playing (blues), their decor makes you feel like you're in New Orleans, and there was incredible service. Our waitress was very attentive, kind, and helpful. It was nice because all of the waiting staff helped each other out, so drinks weren't empty for long, and we got our plates bussed as soon as we were done. The food was absolutely delicious: I got the Cajun Combo, but the stand-out there was the Crawfish Etouffe. It had a nice little kick to it. Paired with a New Orleans beer and the complimentary garlic bread, this meal was the epitome of satisfying. Highly recommend this place--I will certainly return soon."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many many years. The food is always excellent and fresh very authentic cajun. They have 1 of the best crawfish Étouffée that I have ever had including in the new orleans. Friendly's helpful stuff is there to make your meal perfect. Great jumbalaya dirty rice and there garlic bread."}
{"text":"Have not been here in about a year+ because of the move n remove but I must say they are doing the same great quality food service and atmosphere out in Mesa. You have to come out and check this place out for authentic Cajun cuisine. Sooo many awesome dishes to choose from + an incredible happy hour everyday from 3 to 6 and Saturday 2 to 6. One of my favorites for sure is the crawfish etouffee and dirty rice. YUM.
Heidi n Heather are FANTASTIC. 
Come by n check it out for sure."}
{"text":"Not too many places I can get food that taste like home. This place measures up big time.  !!!!"}
{"text":"I could have sworn I already wrote a review for Baby Kay's, but I can't find it, and it's not in the filtered reviews, so I have no idea what happened to it.  So here goes again!  I went there for lunch today and had the half shrimp po boy and cup of seafood gumbo.  I was really impressed with the flavors of the seafood gumbo, which had crawfish and shrimp.  Of course it's not as good as homemade gumbo, but it was still pretty good.  And it's pretty hard to mess up a shrimp po boy, but it was served with this really tasty dressing/spread that I used to spread on the inside of the top bun.  All in all, a good lunch meal! 

I would love to go for their crawfish boils on Wednesday nights, but having lived in Dallas for several years, it would be hard for me to rationalize paying $36 for 4lbs of crawfish, ONE piece of corn and ONE potato.  That's just highway robbery.  Anyone who has lived in places where the boiled crawfish options are abundant, knows that $9 per pound is just too expensive."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, and there's a lot of people from Louisiana who relocate and open up good eats. Therefore, I've had a good amount of delicious Cajun food. I was craving some here in Phoenix, so I thought I'd give Baby Kay's a try.

It's located in a shopping strip with a good amount of parking. The restaurant is big, simple in decor, and there are a couple of servers. I feel like they need at least one more person helping out in the dining room because service was very slow, although when she did stop by our table, she was very good.

We started with the hush puppies, which were a good portion size for the price, but the spices seemed to be lacking. I know hush puppies are usually a simple batter deep fried to perfection, but these were nothing to write home about.

Shrimp etouffee was pretty good. I like that the shrimp were fresh, not frozen, and that there were lots of them. Accompanying rice did not seem fresh, though. Chicken po-boy with BBQ sauce was very boring and not worth the price, but unfortunately that's to be expected of non-seafood dishes in seafood restaurants.

I think the spices were kind of lacking all around, and the service was slow. Prices were kind of high, but at least the seafood is fresh. It wasn't worth the drive for me. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time last weekend with a party of 18 girlfriends and we had a truly fab dinner at Baby Kay's.

Firstly, the staff was wonderful and accommodating- a terrific bunch of people who provided great service to us.

Secondly, the music was great! There was an older gentleman playing some nice grooves on his guitar and we thoroughly enjoyed him!

As for the food? It was really good. I'm not well versed in Cajun food and this was really my first time eating it. I was impressed!

I had a hankering for fish that unfortunately had to go unsatisfied because the only fish they have on the menu here is catfish. Ugh. I am just not a fan of catfish at all! So instead, I ordered the shrimp po'boy sandwich with fries and a side of shrimp etoufee. I didn't eat the \"sandwich\" portion of the po'boy because they served it plain on a dry hoagie bun with only lettuce and tomato on the side. I'm trying to be \"selective\" with my carbs and it just wasn't appetizing enough for me to cheat. Instead, I ate the fried shrimp off the bun and found it to be delicious! Well-seasoned and cooked perfectly! The French fries were also very tasty. I hadn't ever eaten etoufee before, but I was pleasantly surprised! It was uniquely flavorful and scrumptious! I would have preferred more finely chopped onions (there were big onion hunks in this stuff), but other than that I really enjoyed it.

If Baby Kay's was closer to my neck of the woods, I'd be more likely to be a repeat customer because there were a lot of things on their menu I'd have loved to try. I'm not in the East Valley much but if I'm ever in the vicinity, Baby Kay's would be high on my list to go again!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for a birthday dinner. The food and service were both excellent. A Hurricane for a cocktail, the Cajun Sampler, and Bread Pudding with whisky sauce for dessert.

The Hurricane is tasty but not New Orleans potency (a good thing). The food is not cooked super spicy hot but there is a choice of pepper sauces available. Dessert portions were very generous!"}
{"text":"I love cajun food. This place is the best I've found in the valley so far! Still not french quarter caliber but hey, we aren't there. 
The flavors were great. The seafood gumbo and the crawfish etouffee was just the thing to give me my fix for that cajun craving! Way less work and mess than a boil like the kind at the Angry Crab. I felt like I got way more crawfish meat in the etouffee. 
My husband got the fried combo basket with catfish, shrimp and clams. Light breading, very good. They know how to cook their shrimp here.
I feel like they could skip the paper doilies though. 
I love that they have vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"I had the gumbo and jambalaya combo and it came with a salad.  The house dressing is very good and there is subtle heat in the gumbo and jambalaya that sneaks up on you.

The fiance had the pulled pork po boy.  That was porky gold!!  Awsome flavor and tender as the day is long.  

Good blues playing in the background make this a cozy place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I was really impressed by the food here! Not only was it delicious, but the portions were very generous. Great salad, crawfish etoufee, jambalaya, dirty rice, alligator, sweet potato fries, and shrimp po' boy. Basically, it was all amazing! Everyone in our party was happy. Also, great service: one of our friend's plates was late to the table, so the server brought her a complimentary salad to munch on while she waited. 

We will definitely be back! Hopefully we will catch some of the life music next time."}
{"text":"Delicious! the pork chop is to die for! definatly a hole in the wall, definatly worth it!"}
{"text":"Can't give it 5 stars even with the exceptional food. The Chicken & Sausage gumbo is fantastic but at $1 1.50 a bowl it's quite expensive for what you get. Sorry I can't return"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! My husbands family is from Louisiana, so when his uncle told me about this place I jumped at the chance to go. The wait time for a table wasn't bad at all for a Friday night. The food was amazing! We ordered the combo appetizer  but the waiter forgot to put it in. We reminded him and he put it in for us and we got it free. That was fine with us. My sister doesn't like seafood so she had the chicken Alfredo and she said it was very tasty."}
{"text":"We just happened upon this wonderful little place. I believe it's in a newer location and we couldn't be happier. Every plate of food we had was traditional and tasty. The vegetarian etoufee was the biggest surprise with its creamy vegetable sauce over perfectly cooked rice. The jambalaya and gumbo choices were fabulous, especially the duck option. Food is a teeny bit spicy here so be prepared to grab a chilled Abita beer with dinner. Can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"AWESOME Cajun.  
Came in on a Saturday with my husband and sat at the bar to get some Cajun fare.  We got the seafood gumbo and the crab cakes. Both were delish! Shrimp in the soup was plump and juicy.  Sitting at the bar, we talked to the tender and the guests.  Everybody was friendly and the tender even was calling us by name when we left.  She made us great hurricanes too!  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Been feasting at Town & Country Baby Kay's for 10 years - this location offers the same amazing quality Cajun food at great prices.  Quality of Food   The Étouffée = 10 Catfish Sandwich = 10 Chicken and Sausage gumbo = 10   this is the best Cajun food in the valley hands down eat here one time and you're done you're a regular for life - the food is that good"}
{"text":"Serves really really tasty Cajun food.  I usually pop in here for lunch, but the flavors from the food the the ambiance reminds you of New Orleans.

The cajun, honey and bbq wings here are super good!  One thing that they make really good is the Catfish sandwich, crispy on the outside with a side of coleslaw.  

I'm not an expert on this, but I am not a fan of their jambalaya, the rice is a bit bland and too fluffy.  The base sauce that goes with it is not the greatest.  Most of the time, the staffs are courteous and attentive.

Overall, it's a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Great place! Excellent service. When I told the server it was our first time he immediately offered us samples of their most popular dishes - now that's good service! 

The reviews about the etouffee are true. It is slammin and I ate about half of my husband's plate! I got their BBQ shrimp and it was good but the sauce was unique and definitely not your typically BBQ sauce so just go into it knowing that. Great portions.  Side salad was excellent. Wasn't a huge fan of the green olive coleslaw but I had to try it because I've never heard of those flavors put together. Garlic was amazing! 

My biggest reason for giving them 4 instead of 5 stars is kinda petty- they don't have beignets!! And that is so very Cajun and New Orleans. Our server said he had multiple requests for them in the past week so hopefully they start making them soon! If they do, I'll change my review to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend took me here for one of our first dates and we come here for special occasions every year. Lovely staff and amazing gumbo"}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. I think that there's something suspicious about this place.  It's remaining open with the quality of food doesn't add up.  Something else must be sold there.  The food restaurant is a cover"}
{"text":"Baby Kay's is amazing! The service was great. Very friendly and prompt. The crab cakes were delicious and had a great sauce to dip them in. I also really loved the jambalaya and chicken and sausage gumbo. They definitely cook with spice, so if you have trouble with that I probably wouldn't recommend this place. Great flavors with everything we had. If you're interested in dessert, the bread pudding was fabulous, just like everything else."}
{"text":"It is food adventure time or my friends and I again. This time, we were on our quest to try this newly opened Cajun food. When we first walked in, we saw a local musician playing music in the general dining area (what a great way to start our dining experience). The restaurant was extremely busy during business hour and that also means the food is good to me. We started our meal with two different appetizers. I forgot the name of the other one, but one of them was Boudin Balls. I love the apricot-pepper Jelly sauce and the crab cakes was absolutely delicious. As for dinner, I ordered a cajun combination that comes with crawfish etouffee, chicken and sausage jambalaya and substitute seafood gumbo over chicken with a side of green olive salad. All 3 of them were absolutely delicious, especially the crawfish etouffee. I didn't care for the green olive salad but my company seems to like it. 

To complete the cajun dining experience, we ordered a bread pudding dessert and split it between all 6 of us. It was very tasty. If i wasn't so full, I would have probably ordered one just for myself. The reason i didn't give it a 5 star is because our server kept interrupting our conversation every time she came by. I even tried speaking very loudly to my friend the last time she came over and she managed to talk over me anyway. Argh! Can't you wait a little or say \"excuse me\" at least...?

Overall, I do enjoy my dining experience here and will definitely come back here again."}

{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for so long and I'm so sorry it took me so long to do so!! The food is SO good! We got the Cajun combo which has the crawfish etoufee, chicken and shrimp gumbo and jambalaya...all of which were so rich in flavor and slightly spicy. YUM. We also got the fried sausage app and loved it. And do not skip the key lime pie for dessert...best key lime pie ever!!! Also they have a good selection of beers from Louisiana which is cool! We will be back SOON!!"}
{"text":"After having such a phenomenal 2011 Thanksgiving from Baby Kay's, we were anticipating another wonderful experience this year.  We were greatly disappointed.  Our order included 2 turkeys, gravy, cole slaw, dressing, cranberries and dirty rice.  The difference between this year and last year was so great that we couldn't believe this was the same restaurant. Let me explain. 

The turkeys were good. They tasted the same. The dressing was okay but not as filled with nuts and flavor as last year. We had to add a lot of butter, chicken stock and nuts to make it tasty or even close to last year's savory decadence.  The cranberries lived up to last year's order. They were delicious. The cole slaw was a mason jar ($20) of mayo filled with 1/4 cabbage and 10 green olives minced. It should have been more like a salad and less like a mayo spread.  The dirty rice - last year was sticky long rain rice with many pieces of delicious nuggets of crumbly meat. This year it was white rice, similar to Uncle Ben's, loose and with barely any meat. Last but not least, the gravy. It was so burnt that we called the restaurant and returned it. Imagine eating burnt popcorn with flour, butter and Lawry's gravy seasoning and you'll understand. The second batch was only 40% burnt rather than 75% like the first order.   
 
From the minute thanksgiving ended last year, our family was talking about the amazing meal. This continued to be the topic of conversation over the course of the year.  We were so excited to enjoy the flavorful, mouthwatering food again.   This year, with every bite, we became more and more disappointed.  We tried to understand why it was so different. The only explanation we could come up with is that the chef must have changed.  This meal was not worth $400.  If it was like last year, we could have been charged $800 and we would have been happy to pay for it.  Baby Kay's - I'm writing this email so that you will hopefully read this and go back to your former way of cooking.  Your food was so amazing that I want to give you the chance to go back to your old way of cooking. Please read this Baby Kay's.  I'm rooting for you!"}
{"text":"AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!!!
I have to say, walking into this place I was blind. Once we were seated we got our drinks served in less than a few minutes. 
Then the waiter was kind enough to explain what some of the options were. Since I had never really had cajun. Once we put our order in of the Fried Shrimp with Dirty Rice & The Seafood Gumbo, it was given to us in maybe 5-10 mins. There was hardly any wait! The food & service was amazing!!! They have a gentleman who was playing blues music live which made for a Great atmosphere! 
We will definitely be back!! This is a restaurant YOU HAVE TO VISIT!!!"}
