{"text":"Had lunch here twice and tried different burgers which were very good.  Got the brownbag special with comes with a can soda and pasta salad (excellent)."}
{"text":"Blueberry ricotta pancakes were so yummy and very filling. Parking sucks but this place is worth coming to despite that. Industrial but cozy and very friendly service. Came on a Friday just before lunch and there was no wait. In from out of town. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a tasty and satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"I've always had great food and service at Cafe Raymond. My favorite is the tomato mozzarella salad in a wrap... delicious!!"}
{"text":"This food is spot on!!! Super fresh. I had the bacon egg and cheddar on a croissant. Everything's was perfectly cooked, the croissant was so fresh. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Best black bean veggie burger I've ever had. Service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for anyone. All the food was delicious. The French toast was moist through out and the Reuben was excellent. Last but not least you cannot go wrong the breakfast sandwiches and roasted potatoes that come with them. A fun little cafe in the Strip!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of Cafe Raymond since conception. You have to be doing something right if you grew out of a smaller space into a larger one! The food that Ray prepares in his Cafe is 4 star quality. I would put his food on my table before some of the larger restaurants in the area. It does not matter what you order, you will never be disappointed. The food is amazing and the people are even better.  One of the best things about this place has nothing to do with the menu. It that this family is from Pittsburgh. They worked their ass off to make their dreams come true. They have kids that are growing up in their cafe and learning more than a college education could provide. This is the American Dream, in our own YINZER backyard!    I make special trips to Cafe Raymond with my own family. The warmth and community that you feel the minute that you step inside is priceless. I can't even tell you enough about the food--you will have to try that for yourself.  When in doubt, ALWAYS SUPPORT an Entrepreneur--especially one from Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The egg and cheese breakfast sandwich changed me. A spiritual experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast. La Prima coffee is excellent. Blueberry ricitta pancakes are great. Everything we had was delicious."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Quick and easy.  Had the eggs and corned beef hash special - which was great.  Would come back to try more.  Coffee was not good - especially with so many good coffee options in the Strip."}
{"text":"Blueberry pancakes are the best pancakes I ever ate\"....You have to try them. Raymond's cafe makes really good food."}
{"text":"Cafe Raymond set the bar pretty high for our first trip to Pittsburgh! Definitely appears to be a place the locals hangout. We loved our sandwiches ~ the muffaletta and baked Italian!"}
{"text":"Cafe Raymond's has great French toast!!! The eggs & bacon were awesome as well! You get plenty of food & the staff is really friendly! I went during the week & there was no wait! It was my first visit but I will definitely be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place. And the food is  absolutely delicious! My favorites ... the classic burger, the ham and gruyere croissant, the smoked salmon platter. Hey! The list goes on and on. And don't forget the soup and quiche. I always top off my meal with one of Ray's homemade pastries. Take your pick. Trust me on this one. They're sinfully good. Breakfast? I do an omelet and then treat myself to either ricotta pancakes or french toast---drizzled with some kind of strawberry sauce. It's my morning desert. This place alone is worth a trip to the Strip. Oh! Mercy! Forgot to mention the BLT on a croissant. Just might be my favorite. Shucks. Least I forget. The grilled cheese sandwich!!!!!"}
{"text":"We planned to go to another very popular breakfast spot and there was quite a wait so we choose Raymonds as a 2nd choice. Got right in, and their breakfast was AWESOME! Service was great. All the food is cooked by Raymond-homemade sauces, breads, local meats. Can't say enough. We will be back! Do not discount it for lesser reviews than some other places on Yelp. It will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Cafe Raymond was a great breakfast spot in a pinch. We were looking for a place around market Square early on a Saturday morning. But we couldn't find anything we liked as much in the business District was closed. So we drove about a mile out of Center City to caf√© Raymond to have breakfast.  The pastries were phenomenal. My mother got a very light lemon pastry. We all had regular breakfast as well. The potatoes were definitely the best part, they were seasoned to perfection.   The line at the register went quickly, as you were before you sit down."}
{"text":"After a late night with the girls. We walked through the strip like zombies searching for something good to eat. The Yankees are in town so the strip was packed with tourists. Every breakfast place had lines around the corners so we flipped a coin and ended up here. We waited about 20-25 min for a seat. The restaurant is pretty small but they do offer a little bit of outside seating. The menu is pretty simple breakfast, sandwiches, burgers and salads. They didn't have a turkey burger so I went with the ciabatta and lox sandwich which came with a side of seasoned potatoes. The seating is very intimate by the way . All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked delicious especially the French toast.  It took about 15 min for our food to arrive. My potatoes were very well seasoned! My sandwich was ok. It had all of the essential items tomato, capers, red onion and cream cheese. I enjoyed my sandwich and for as busy as it was the customer service was great."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. Showed up on Easter Sunday for breakfast. Coffee, feta spinach quiche /w deliciously seasoned potato wedges, hame and brie sandwich on italian bread. Oh, and one more thing, ricotta blueberry pancakes... The quiche crust has a sweetness, so if you're into savory / sweet combos. The quality of eggs and spinach used is up there. The ricotta pancakes were so good, I think its in the batter, who knows ? I've got a breakfast spot in Pittsburgh :=)"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to review Cafe Raymond for fear it will get more popular, but I think it's time. Part of the charm is that you usually can get right in and grab a table either inside or outside immediately. And if you sit outside you can even bring your pup! I've enjoyed this cafe for years but especially recently it's become a staple location when I'm going out to breakfast or lunch.   All of the items I've tried have been great. They don't have just standard cafe fare like you might expect, they somehow elevate everything to the next level. Breakfast sandwiches are huge and my family has compared the croissants to ones they had in France. The smoked salmon platter is fresh and a hearty serving of lox. For lunch I usually get the nicoise salad - so many toppings! - and my boyfriend loves the muffaletta sandwich. But everything else we've had is good as well!  My strong advice - skip the greasy diners in the area and get a good meal from Cafe Raymond instead. Just don't go so often that it starts getting lines like the diners do (-:"}
{"text":"Second time being here. Ordered everyone's favorite blueberry pancake and 2 fried eggs over BBQ brisket for our first visit. This time, I wanted to try something different so I ordered a salmon platter and again the BBQ brisket (it is SOOOO GOOD!) the salmon platter would not recommend."}
{"text":"Real food, real good.   We ordered a couple breakfast dishes (thank you for serving breakfast all day): 1) The smoked salmon platter which came with FOUR slices of smoked salmon, bread (it normally comes with ciabatta but I got wheat toast), cream cheese, cucumber, tomato, capers, and red onion.   2) The Guys's breakfast: two eggs scrambled with cheese, potatoes, a wonderfully fluffy blueberry ricotta pancake, and a meat (which we subbed out for another egg, but really we got something like four total).  What made this meal fantastic was that we were kind of able to share the dishes and combine the smoked salmon with eggs (one of my fave combos). The eggs were good although not incredibly flavorful, same with the toast. Quality salmon, and perfect spice on the potatoes. The blueberry pancakes were fluffy and delicious topped off with 100% pure, local maple syrup. Our meal was a a bit pricey but we got a ton of food and really enjoyed ourselves. A really great option for (all-day) breakfast in the strip."}
{"text":"Always a line but moves very quickly. The place is clean and super cute. So many choices on the board but when the daily specials are gone your out of luck. So get there early if you can! Pancakes are off the charts!! Eggs and brisket hash was a great choice too. I ordered an omelette and it was perfect. Lots of food. But get pancakes to share then order something else so you can have a taste of everything!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and I had a great experience. While scrolling through the reviews, I noticed one of the reviewers took away a star or 2 due to customer service. In his review he said the person working the front counter should explain to people how their process works (you order at the counter and they deliver your food to your table). Well they did explain the process to me when I walked in, so they must read the Yelp reviews and take action to improve the customer experience--so to me that's good. Also it is a cafe not a fine dining experience--so with my expectations of it being a cafe set in place, I personally thought their customer service was great.   The food is fantastic which is the most important part of a dining experience for me. Prices are very reasonable and the food is high quality. I had the Ciabatta and Lox sandwich which came with a side of potatoes. I was seated quickly and got my food quickly. I will return in the future"}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm a fan. This was my first time to Cafe Raymond and it was a very enjoyable experience. We went to Sunday Brunch after church and arrived at about 12:30 p.m. to almost a full house. It's a long fairly galley style space with the ordering line and kitchen on the left side of the room and a long line of 2-person tables along the right side.   The entire place smelled of delicious bacon when we entered and inspired my husband to order the BLT. I ordered a cup of hot tea and was given a cup of boiled water and shown to the tea station where they had several types of upscale tea bags in various flavors. I chose a traditional Earl Grey and it was a very good cup of tea - they also had lemon, milk and sugar for those wanting to doctor their tea up.   I had read about the fantastic Blueberry Ricotta pancakes and decided I would try those; my husband got the BLT with roasted potatoes on the side and a delicious fresh crunchy dill pickle spear. The pancakes weren't the end-all and be-all of pancakes, but they were quite good. I will definitely be moving on to trying some of their sandwiches next time.   During our time there I had the chance to speak with a couple of the lovely girls who work there and they were both very friendly and helpful. One of the best perks about this place is that they have nice restrooms in the basement with elevator (or stairs) access. This is important for me as I have mobility challenges and stairs are super taxing on me. It's great to find a restroom in the Strip District and especially one for folks who can't do stairs.  I will definitely return to Cafe Raymond as we had a great Brunch meal and an all-round enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing the good ratings on yelp and it did not disappoint! You walk in and order what you want and pay before seated. You get a table number and get to choose where you want to sit and the food will be taken to your table number.   I ordered the French toast on challah bread with a strawberry jam-type drizzled on top with blueberries and whipped cream. It came with FOUR pieces!! So it was very filling. We also ordered the blueberry ricotta pancakes. I expected the ricotta to be pretty overwhelming but to my surprise it wasn't too much! I liked the combination with the blueberries and the pancakes were very fluffy:)   Service was really nice and the restaurant wasn't too busy or crowded. Would definitely recommend this place and maybe even come here again to try their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Very nice staff and ordered the Rueben sandwich and it was amazing. Can't wait to come back for breakfast ."}
{"text":"I pick a different place for brunch each weekend. I really enjoyed Cafe Raymond. You order at the counter, pay and get assigned a table. Food is good. Portions are ample. I will return!"}
{"text":"Ok, let me start by saying that I'm giving 3 stars instead of 5 for a few reasons unrelated to the food itself.   1. The counter staff and their lack of communication with the guests. This restaurant is unique because you order at the counter and then everything else is self serve. This concept is not new to me, but it was my first time at this establishment, and it would have been nice for the girl taking our order to simply say \"Have you eaten here before?\", and if we said \"No\", she could have simply taken a moment to explain how everything works.  2. The place was clean overall but there were quite a few gnats flying around the day I went.  3. This place is a BYOB and they charge you a $5 corking fee (which is fine), but they don't actually uncork your bottle for you. If you are going to charge me $5, at least uncork my Prosecco and offer wine glasses (which are available behind the counter), without me having to ask.   That being said, the food at Cafe Raymond was delicious. We ordered a few separate dishes and everyone was more than satisfied with their meal. We had the Two Eggs Breakfast, BLT Croissant, Corn Beef Hash with Two Eggs and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Our meal was served quickly and it was delicious.   As a person who was raised in the serving industry, I know that the staff can make or break a restaurant. And although I would consider going back to Cafe Raymond if I were specifically in the The Strip area, I would definitely rather spend my money somewhere like Square Cafe (Regent District), where both the food AND the service were outstanding."}
{"text":"I haven't even gotten my food and I already love this place.  The strip is super busy and we lucked by this place at 10:30AM on a Sunday.  All eight of us very hungry.  Thanks to a very nice gentleman already sitting at a table who offered to move, they were able to seat us together.  Most would find the menu delightful, unless you are an 11 year old who just wants cereal.  Nevermind that... that is my personal little crisis (she got toast - wheat as no white was available - and milk; she'll be fine).   The food is gorgeous.  The blueberry ricotta pancakes were no less than divine.  Staff super friendly and attentive.  Many places in the district were way busier than this and I have no idea why.  This place is a must.  So glad I made this local place a part of my out of town experience.    Oh and that 11 year old.  Yeah, she loved my pancakes, too."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast, just awesome! Their Owner/Chef is internationally trained and the dishes are unique. Sadly, I'm off red meat because his brisket hash topped with two fried eggs looked amazing. I asked for a green pepper, onion and cheddar cheese. I got green, red and yellow pepper, onion and cheddar cheese. Service was awesome, was asked by 3 different servers if we enjoyed our meals. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"We live in Rochester, NY & came to Pittsburgh for the weekend and stumbled across this place. Absolutely amazing.. I've been thinking about it everyday since. Can't wait to go back! Amazing quality, great service and phenomenal breakfast foods."}
{"text":"May or may have not been the best brunch I've ever had in Pittsburgh.  You pay at the cashier then seat yourself with a table number thing.  LEMON & RICOTTA PANCAKES ($9): So fluffy like what I'd imagine a cloud to taste like. Melted in your mouth like cotton candy. I highly recommend this if you're coming for breakfast or brunch.  FRENCH TOAST ($9): This jam is to die for. It's not too sweet, reminds me of a smoothie bowl. The french toast is also a bit crispy, but not too chewy. OMELETTE ($10): Got bacon, mushrooms, and swiss cheese (It says you can put up to 3 fresh ingredients). So so so cheesy, almost too cheesy for me. Crazy cheese pulls, perfect for pics. This gave the extra edge of savoriness to our shared meal. These three picks were perfect to share together, as they all had their own strengths of sweetness, tanginess, and savoriness.  Got busy around lunchtime on a weekday really fast, good thing we came at 11. I was so impressed by the breakfast foods that I would love to come back for lunch for their gourmet sandwiches."}
{"text":"Very chill vibe--excellent spot for breakfast/ lunch on the strip. Food was great and the people working there are all incredibly nice. Love the wooden plates."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Cafe Raymond to see what all the buzz was about, and we were NOT disappointed! We went around 10:30 on a Sunday and it wasn't overly crowded. There were a few people in line ahead of us, but we didn't wait to order our food for no more than 5 minutes. The staff was super friendly from the second we walked in the door to the time we left. Once we sat down, our food was in front of us before we knew it. I got the ham & Gruyere croissant with an added egg, and my husband got the NY smoked salmon platter. Everything was so fresh!! We also split a raspberry and cheese danish, and it was delicious!   One thing we couldn't help but notice was how CLEAN everything was. Everything was wiped down, the kitchen is open so we could see it all and it looked like everything was brand new. Maybe it was, but it looks like they run a tight ship, and we were very pleased about that.   We will definitely be back soon. I have to try those pancakes I've been hearing so much about!"}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try new places in the strip district and this one did not disappoint! On a busy Sunday, we were through the line and seated quickly and our food wasn't far behind. Everyone in my group got something different and it was rave reviews all around. For simple sandwiches and breakfast I thought it was a little pricy, but truly the experience was great and there are so many menu options I'd like to try that I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Tired of ordering the same old catering for a business meeting luncheon so I gave Cafe Raymond a try and I am so happy I did. Everyone was very impressed with the Mediterranean Salad that consisted Spring mix, feta cheese, roasted red tomatoes, olives, capers, kalamata olives, cucumbers, red onions and Raymond's house lemon vinaigrette. They did not skimp, so if you are not a fan of any item, ask them to go light especially the onions since red onions are quite strong.  Nice assortment of signature sandwiches. Chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin and red velvet cookies were very fresh and quite the hit. Order was delivered on time and accurately."}
{"text":"I walked past Cafe Raymond on my stroll to DeLuca's and and decided to backtrack here to avoid a wait...  First off, you smell the yumminess from this place as you walk by. Through the window, I noticed folks happily dining on breakfast foods and chatting a way. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted and given some suggestions for breakfast. You order at the counter and then seat yourself. The space is really inviting with warm wood decor everywhere, tables...counters, etc.  The menu seems to have some tasty offerings but my main focus was on breakfast this visit. The menu is simple with options for your normal platter of eggs, meat, potatoes and toast or some sammies. They had a brisket hash that sounded yummy but a little too heavy for me that early.  I opted for 2 eggs over med, bacon, potatoes, toast. I had a chance to sample some of another meal at the table too which is always a plus Lol.  The bacon was thick and very smokey and flavorful...I just wish it could've been cooked a tad bit more. The fat on the bacon needed some thrashing of the teeth to separate, for lack of a better description. Eggs were cooked well. The potatoes had a boat load of pepper on them which caught me off guard.  Every piece didn't have that much pepper but it seemed like it was a steak type of seasoning on them. They were ok...didn't really enjoy them. Now, that ricotta blueberry pancake I had a bite of made me regret my choice! This thing was fluffy, light and full of blueberry goodness.  The maple syrup was delish as well. I could eat those forever but my thighs would object. I saw a trend with the waitresses carrying multiple plates of those yummy cakes to other tables too. The drink options were limited and we settled on OJ, not fresh squeezed but it served the purpose. Maybe I'm being a bit cheap but our breakfast came to $33.12. That seems a bit pricey for what we ordered and $7 for OJ, I dunno. I will definitely go back for my own pancakes and look over the lunch offerings next time. I won't say I'm passionately in love with this spot but it's worth a test drive for sure."}
{"text":"This place was a nice find on the strip. We ducked in not expecting much, but ended up having a delicious breakfast for a reasonable price. I had the special, which consisted of fried eggs atop a bbq beef hash. The bbq was flavorful, with a spicy kick at the end that had me finishing my plate in record time. The coffee was also pretty good, and the free refills were a nice added bonus. I'm looking forward to visiting the next time I'm in Pittsburgh, and seeing what else their menu has to offer!"}
{"text":"I've been frequenting the Strip District for breakfast for many years now, but found myself looking for a change of pace (in addition to--and more importantly--some pancakes), and Yelp led me to Cafe Raymond. For some reason the Strip makes me feel like a tourist in my own city (in a good way!), and Cafe Raymond reinforced that as soon as I walked in. Very warm, bright, and inviting, I hopped into a line that moved quickly to place my order. The blueberry ricotta pancakes had been the reason that Cafe Raymond caught my eye on Yelp in the first place, so I put in my order and sat down to enjoy my coffee (which may have been from La Prima--it was delicious!) to ride out the short wait to my pancakes.  Now these pancakes... did not disappoint. I had been jonesing pancakes for days before this visit, and they were perfectly dense yet still fluffy and not too heavy, having a generous amount of blueberries dotted throughout. It came with whipped cream (which I was initially not super excited about, but after taking a bite, the effect of blueberries and cream came through) as well as local maple syrup on the side. It was a generous portion and I left full.  I would love to come back to sample the lunch menu--other folks around me looked like they had some delicious sandwiches and salads. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Would have been a 5-Star review if they would have had an explanation at the door about the seating process."}
{"text":"Definitely the best breakfast I've had in Pittsburgh so far. Highly recommend. Great menu and fast service!"}
{"text":"Cafe Raymond in the Strip is my favorite place to go for breakfast or lunch. I have never been disappointed in the food or the service. The signature ricotta blueberry pancakes are superb. I also love the vegetarian muffaletta sandwich. It's the best I've ever had. I've taken friends from New York City, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco to eat at Cafe Raymond's and they were all impressed with the food, the personnel and the atmosphere. I recommend Cafe Raymond as the best place to eat in the Strip!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I may go 5-Stars, but I've only been there once. I'll be back, so I may reassess.   What I like: - FOOD was great. More below.  - Service was friendly. Warm even.  - Setting is cool. Very clean and fresh inside what must be an old building.   THE FOOD: Mine was great. I got a Raymond Burger, which is a pretty standard, large cheeseburger, with shredded lettuce, tomato, and \"special sauce.\"    It was served with a hand full of wavy chips and a huge dill pickle (that was excellent, I might add).  It was served very hot (my preference), on a pretty basic bun, but the bun was warm and very soft, obviously fresh. While there is no \"secret ingredient\" to this fairly standard burger, the execution was top notch. The beef was cooked medium well (trace of pink), and was very juicy. Excellent.   My side salad was surprisingly large and also very fresh and crisp. Comprised mostly of field greens, it did have some nice olives, cucumber slices, and other food stuff I can't remember.  It came with a house vinaigrette that worked well.   I see lots of all-day breakfast items on the menu, as well as lots of other sandwiches and burgers, so I need to go back and try more.   I definitely can recommend this place quite highly. Give it a try and fling us your take on it!  Yelp on!"}
{"text":"I was so pleased to grab lunch here after viewing their menu options. There really is something for everyone. I had a veggie wrap and it came in a spinach wrap with a pesto sauce. I cannot express to you how fresh this tasted (after further review, we discovered they make their bread fresh daily)!    The line moved quickly and we were able to grab a table in front of the kitchen. I enjoyed how the inside was set-up and every employee was smiling and friendly. One thing I personally did not like was that my wrap came with Ruffles potato chips. It's a slight pet peeve of mine when delis do this. It's as though you're presenting this amazing meal that's fresh and delicious and you can't do any better than chips. From a bag. It's a desperate cry for help, in my opinion. But I digress....also for my side I was given a delicious pickle. My wrap came with a side salad as well (which came out so fast!), which included a beautiful, homemade lemon vinaigrette on the side. The coffee I added is organic, which was an added bonus for me, and water cups are free with the option of lemon. Breakfast options are available too. I can't wait to come back here- it really hit the spot."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I passed this gem up, simply because when I'm in the Strip, I feel obligated to go for food from another culture entirely (I do curry or sushi here a lot). So when I was looking for a place to please a group of four friends, I didn't think of Cafe Raymond. However, we were all hungry enough that we stumbled in to the closest place: I am SO glad it was this place. Once we got in, it was obvious we'd be waiting a bit to order (the line for lunch on a Sunday is no joke!) so we took our time scoping out the menu. I have to say, I was impressed by their wide range of tantalizing options! I ended up landing on the Veggie Muffaletta, served on focaccia bread. First impression: This sandwich is massive! Definitely 2 meals, unless you go starving hungry. And it tasted Amazing. Like a folded homemade focaccia made by a loving Italian grandma. Friends got The Club, a Spinach, Mushroom and Feta Omelette, and the special of the day: Italian Style Eggs Benedict, which I tried. It was really wonderful... I liked my Veggie Muffaletta just a TAD bit more. Next for me to try: Coffeehouse Burger! I'm not usually a burger gal, but it just sounds STELLAR. I'd say this place is a must-try. With everything made from scratch and deliciously fresh ingredients, you're bound to love Raymond!"}
{"text":"Great for brunch! We came around 11AM on a Tuesday and it was not too busy. You order at the front and then are seated at a table. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Little Guy's Breakfast Plate and it was amazing! Our table was also a little lopsided and although I didn't notice, our server was very attentive and fixed the problem. The blueberry ricotta pancakes were to die for and the rest of our food was good as well. We will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Surprised that I never wrote a review for this place so I came again this morning to try it once more. As such, this joint has moved from their old location a little down the block but still on the same street. As soon as I entered, I could notice what an improvement the new place is easily over the old place ... wow. I chose to order the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes along with two eggs sunny-side up and a sausage. For those of you who don't know, you order at the counter and they'll give you a number plaque and bring your order right to you when it's ready. Bit into the pancakes and it brought back memories of when I had it the first time ... really, just as good as they've ever been. Freshly made, the maple syrup was a wonderful addition, and I could really appreciate the thought of using real fruit (blueberries). Quite yummy indeed. Eggs were also well done. I will ding them on the sausage though as I thought it was a little too hard for my liking ... probably overcooked so if anything, I would suggest taking the sausage out just a little earlier to preserve what would otherwise be a much softer but more delicious sausage. Overall, great place to come for breakfast, brunch, and lunch ... if you haven't been here yet, you should definitely give this place a try for sure!"}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since I've had a breakfast that good, in fact it caused a complete emotional breakdown followed by crocodile tears of joy and hugging the entire wait staff! I had the eggs over BBQ Brisket Hash and it was so inventive and flavorful, I could t inhale it fast enough!  I've been sitting here for four hours not knowing what to do with my life meow....I guess it's time for lunch!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast on Labor Day. Egg/cheese on a croissant with potatoes. Excellent dish. 2nd floor seating offered a nice view of Penn."}
{"text":"I love the new location! They were very busy (understandably) on Black Friday at 10am but after a short wait in the counter line we were seated upstairs and received our food after just a few minutes. We were all hungry so we ordered a piece of fig baklava from the counter to share before our meals arrived. The flavor was amazing! The piece was big enough for four of us to all enjoy.  Food:  - The Turkey Club: Fantastic! The bacon was cooked perfectly and the turkey was fresh. I was a big fan!  - The Burger: My sister reported that it had the best pickles ever - and was cooked to perfection.  Helpful hints: upstairs seating is more spacious, there are water pitchers on both the first and second floors, the baklava makes a great appetizer!  I'll see you soon, Raymond... I'll see you soon."}
{"text":"If you catch this place early enough, you can get in quickly, no prob.  Wait too long and you will keep waiting in line.  We have only been for breakfast and the food has been good and very filling.  Seems like all plates served with potatoes, no complaints on those.  I like that you pay upfront and then hang out while your food is being made.  I also like the open kitchen design so you can see what is going on."}
{"text":"Very good food! Highly recommended. Probably the best breakfast in town! Had the special Italian Style Eggs Benedict. The rest of the table had omelets and croissant sandwich. No complaints."}
{"text":"All around great.  The place is busy. I was expecting a wait but wow was the service quick. You get in line to order and then are given a number to take to your table. The service is fantastic.  We had a lunch sandwich, a breakfast sandwich, and pancakes. Each item was crazy good. The croissant bacon egg sandwich was perfection. The sandwiches came with fried potatoes.  The drinks were good.  Fantastic non-alcoholic brunch option for the Strip District."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place very much. Service was top notch. Staff was super professional and very friendly. We got the lunch special. $12.75 for any whole sandwich, choice of side, drink and a homemade cookie.   I chose the pastrami. It was warm and toasted and tasted very good. Lean cuts of warm pastrami sliced thin on premium bread with melted cheese and a generous amounts of whole grain mustard, lettuce and tomato, all fresh. My friend got a turkey sandwich. It looked like the sandwich belonged on the cover of a food blog. The care taken to make both sandwiches was great. Red velvet cookie was perfect and pasta salad was amazing. Will return very soon."}
{"text":"Listen to reviews, this place is great! I really liked the easy going atmosphere - you walk in, place order & pay. They bring you your food. Breakfast was very good, did not have a huge selection but what they did have was very good. Would like to vegan option, at least one. Also, had Heinz ketchup with high fructose corn syrup which was bummer. We told ray about Organic Heinz and he said he would start using it! We will see next time we swing by!"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. I had blueberry pancakes my friend had a burger...it was all great. While waiting in line to order they gave us a table number and found us a table upstairs on the balcony. My new favorite place in the Strip."}
{"text":"Came into Cafe Raymond for a late Saturday Brunch and was initially a little confused. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you, similar to a Panera. The drinks (other than coffee) is self serve. Plus they're BYO ($5 corking fee) and have glasses for champagne & wine.   I had the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes, cooked light, and the Croissant BLT. The pancakes were incredible, not too heavy, perfect texture and it as accompanied with warm maple syrup. BLT was also delicious, not too heavy - but very filling.   My sister had the 2 eggs with toast and hash browns. She throughly enjoyed it and the hash browns were very tasty. My niece had the BBQ brisket hash. Although I'm pretty sure it was a special as I can't seem to find it on the online menu.  Overall, this was a great experience. I'm excited to continue dining here."}
{"text":"This would have been a five star for the food, but I have to deduct a star or so for a crazy awkward process.   We stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday around 9.  It's fast-casual style...ish.  It looks like a fast casual setup, but then you discover that they have a sort-of-server who does some things, but not others.    To start, you go in and order at the counter.  The menu/pastries/specials are in a couple different places and it's a little overwhelming to choose quickly if there is someone behind you.  At some point; you are supposed to be given a number, presumably before you hit the cashier.  That didn't happen, so the cashier assigned a number, took our order, and then advised that someone would seat us with that number.   We were asked if we wanted inside or on the balcony, so at least that narrowed down the hunt when we went to find the table with our number on it.  When we found it, we saw that it was in a sunny corner.  I get it...it's outside and we asked for that...but if I'd been given the opportunity for input, I'd have picked one in the shade.     Anyhow, a server brought our food and checked in several times to see if we needed anything.  I found this weird for several reasons.  First, while she asked if we needed things, she wasn't actually going to bring about half of them.  We asked for water and were told that it was self-serve inside.  Ok - no problem - up we go.  Coffee was much more of a conundrum.  She came around and kept refilling, which then required us to keep getting up again and again to go inside for cream and sugar.  Why bring the coffee at all if you aren't going to bring the rest of it?  Just leave it all inside and we will get it at our leisure. Second, you pay inside when you order as if you are on your own from there.  Were we supposed to tip that limited service server?  She did bring the food and pick up the dishes.  No idea, but since we didn't have cash, we were a little stuck there.     All in all, the food was plentiful and delicious.  Not cheap for breakfast, but you get a lot for it and the flavors were good.   The process though was a little weird for me."}
{"text":"I hit up Cafe Raymond for Brunch on Saturday morning. Since I hasn't been before, I wasn't sure what to expect, but it has great reviews so I was excited to try it.   I hadn't realized that you order your food and then get seated at a table. Luckily, I had looked up what I wanted to order, so I didn't have to hold up the line. The line was pretty long around 11:30am. But there were tables available and they had the patio open upstairs.   I ordered an omelette- you can pick up to 3 add-ins for your omelette. The omelettes come with a side of potatoes. I added bacon, cheddar cheese, and mushrooms. The omelette was delicious! It was full of toppings and was a great size for the price. The potatoes were a little spicy, but with a little Heinz ketchup- they were great.   I also split an order of lemon ricotta pancakes - they were wonderful. I definitely can understand why everyone likes them. They weren't the best pancakes I've ever had, but they were very good. I would definitely order them again or try the French toast next time.   Overall, I loved my experience at Cafe Raymond and will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I love cafes and Cafe Raymond is such a nice addition to the strip! The interior is really warm and inviting with rustic vibes. You order your meal at the register up front and then take a seat indoors or outdoors. I came in between breakfast and lunch so I decided to order the veggie muffaletta sandwich to go. You could taste the freshness of the veggies and let me tell you it was delish! The sandwich came with grilled portobello, eggplant, zucchini, squash, roasted red pepper, olive salad, pesto and provolone on focaccia for $7.75. This sandwich was a lot bigger than I expected for the price. I am really excited to try their breakfast during my next visit. They also have a case filled with fresh pastries from scratch that look so yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the Strip District.  Not only do they have some delicious food, the service and atmosphere are great as well.  The place is setup in an older style lunch spot way.  You order as you walk in from a chalkboard and seat yourself.  Everything from the plates to the seating go with their overall theme.  The kitchen is open to the restaurant which is a cool look.    The workers could not have been more friendly.  They gave us their picks for the best meal and side dish options.  They also got us our food very fast.  For my meal I had the blues burger.  It had bacon, blue cheese crumbles, and blue cheese sauce.  The flavors all came together it tasted delicious.  The peppercorn crusting was a little much and It was over cooked for the medium rare I ordered, but was still great.  Finally, the brioche bun was one of the best burger buns I have ever had and held all of the ingredients together perfectly.  I will definitely be back to try some more of their burgers and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Such a great environment! Staff was pleasant and very efficient. Decor is cute and homey. Low prices and high quality food. Definitely recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Quiche was outstanding! Loved the acoustic music and Sunday afteroon brunch vibe.  Friendly service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"While everyone else stands in line at DeLuca's, Pamela's, Primanti's, I am perfectly happy to step right into Cafe Raymond and have a delicious breakfast or lunch. The first time I stopped in here for a quick lunch and was intrigued by the veggie muffuletta. It came with portabella mushrooms as the \"meat\". Although it wasn't quite as good as the original, it was certainly tasty and a bit healthier. Since then I have been here several times for breakfast and lunch. Everything I have tried has been excellent and the service is always good. There is very clean restroom facilities in the basement for customers (a good find in the strip). As a matter of fact, the whole restaurant is clean and bright with a definite New Orleans vibe. There is always water with fresh lemon available as self-serve. The bread is homemade on site and so is the breakfast sausage. I really love this place!"}
{"text":"Eating here right now and I had to write a review. We waiting in line for DeLuca's but it was super long so we looked next door and saw their special of 2 Eggs of Beef Brisket Hash. Done deal, we went inside.  We had a big group but the cashier/staff were SUPER nice. Like incredibly nice and pleasant.   Food was INCREDIBLE. Brisket hash was amazing. Blueberry Ricotta pancakes were incredible as well.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Screw DeLuca's, just stop next door and skip the wait."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here!! I had a the blueberry ricotta pancakes, and my girl friend had an omelette! Both were reasonable prices, big portions, and took a reasonable time to make! The set up was great where you ordered upfront, and someone brought the food to your table when it was ready. Even though the restaurant was busy our food did not take long as I said before. They had a great selection of breakfast and lunch selection! I would definitely come back, and highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided on cafe Raymond after we saw the huge lines for DeLuca's and Pamela's. You order in line like you would at a Panera bread and take your seat once you place your order. I was hungry and so I went for the muffaletta. My wife wanted to be healthy so she decided on the veggie wrap with a side salad and lemon vinaigrette. About 5 minutes after we placed our orders our food came out.  My muffaletta was perfect, they prepared the sandwich on homemade focaccia bread. This was the perfect match for this great sandwich. Inside the bread were two different kinds of olive salads and an assortment of Italian meats and cheese. The best part of the sandwich though was the bread. I am from Philly and bread is huge and almost as important as the contents inside the sandwhich. Cafe Raymond takes pride in their food and you can tell in every bit.  4/5 in my opinion. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food AND Service was outstanding!  Had a business lunch here and while it's not the traditional restaurant (you order/pay first then they deliver your order), I'll certainly return.  Bravo Management and the greeter and cashier were very welcoming and cordial...great job!!!  I asked for a sandwich recommendation and the Italian Roast Beef is the employee favorite and now it's mine as well!"}
{"text":"What a perfect find on the Strip for breakfast!  The ambiance is a blend of rustic old and new, very current with trends in restaurant spaces.  Wait staff friendly and prompt.  The feature food this morning was the ricotta pancakes!  Omelette a very close second.  Obviously higher end ingredients with flavor!  Satisfying to the palate and healthful!  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Brisket Hash is one of the best things to get anywhere for brunch in Pittsburgh.  Great options and great food."}
{"text":"First, I hadn't realize Cafe Raymond had moved a few blocks. That through me for a loop! Anyway, I had been to the old location no less than 100x for lunch over the years - would recommend lox salad and any soup. But this review is for their brunch, which I hadn't realize Cafe Raymond had. A quick search on Yelp for breakfast places and I just had to go.   I met a friend here and she was a few minutes ahead of me. She was able to grab a table and hot tea, no issues. Once I arrived, we placed our order at the counter then reclaimed our table. We were there a few minutes after 10am on a Sunday, which was perfect timing. As we sat waiting for our food, a huge line formed. It seems like people eat and leave pretty quickly though, so I can't imagine waiting for a table would take long. The ordering process is streamlined and they use a number system to locate you when your food is ready.   We both ended up ordering the same thing, which was surprising with so many good choices on the menu -- sausage, egg and cheese croissant. I was pleasantly surprised when it showed up with a side of potatoes. For ~$9, you can't beat it. The croissant was comprised of fluffy goodness and the egg arrived piping hot. There's a self-serve water station, which I always appreciate.  All of the staff I encountered were pleasant and it was a very successful start to my Sunday. Thanks, Cafe Raymond!"}
{"text":"Cafe Raymond has never ceased to amaze me. The cafe is so cute and clean. The service is wonderful. I had the Reuben and I am very picky about this sandwich. It was wonderful and the corned beef was thick but not fatty. My son, who is usually picky about his PB & J, was also impressed. Usually he does not like panini style pb&j but loved this one! The bathrooms are very clean which is hard to find in the strip. We will definitely be coming back time and time again!"}
{"text":"We found this place while waiting in line for another restaurant. We were HUNGRY and didn't feel like waiting haha. Cafe Raymond did not disappoint! I had French toast, it was topped with strawberries and blueberries. So good!"}
{"text":"Repeat visitor to the Strip District, but the first trip for my wife.  She wanted to eat at Pamela's Diner, despite my feedback that it was routine diner food, especially if you try to avoid gluten and therefore don't want to partake of their signature crepe-style pancake.  Anyway, we learned the wait for Pamela's on a Sunday morning was an expected 45 minutes ... not wanting to lose that much time, we walked around the corner to Cafe Raymond, and I was SO happy we did.  Pro's: 1) less than a 5 minute wait; 2) cold brew coffee was delicious; 3) execution of my omelet was top-notch; without the considerable grease of a diner.  Con's: onions were advertised as \"sauteed\", but they were basically raw.  I like the former; dislike the latter, but wasn't that hard to pick them off.  Next time I'll skip them."}
{"text":"Had a nice breakfast with the boyfriend! The food was delicious and cooked in a healthy manner. Everything seemed really clean and not overly cooked with oils.  Reason why I took off a star was because the food took over 30 mins to get to us and one of the meals was pretty cold.   @theabchick approved healthy restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I really appreciate this place. I like places that have different, unique things and this place has that. The chairs were cute, the decor was vintage and the place was industrial/rustic. The kitchen was open so you could see the cooks. There was the newly adopted, grouped seating but we had our own table. We were taken care of right away and our table was claimed, and we were to order at the front first. They have a lot of chalkboard signs which I'm a big fan of. The menu was pretty cool and they had just enough options. The best part is that they serve breakfast all day. I really liked that they had cream and sugar at a separate part so that you can add that to your tea or coffee. The waitress who was taken care of the tables was pretty nice and she started conversation. She made sure we wer taken care of. This place wasn't crowded and wasn't hard to be seated, especially on Saint Patrick's Day morning On the strip in which I had reservations that we wouldn't be sat. It was easy to do. What can I say..I like my tea like I like him; hot, blonde and sweet. :)"}
{"text":"** Solid brunch place in the strip district with a wide selection of breakfast foods (all day) as well as sandwiches. Blueberry ricotta pancakes are for sure a highlight to check out.  This place has been super hyped up to me after hearing my girlfriend and her friends rave about how good the ricotta pancakes were, how they were \"so soft that they melt in your mouth,\" and how this place is the \"best breakfast place in Pittsburgh.\" Eventually I had to check it out to see if they were just blowing up smoke or this place was legit. After coming here with her to try out their ricotta pancakes, I have to say they were't exaggerating.   I ordered the guy's breakfast, which came with a good variety of bacon, eggs, potatoes and the blueberry ricotta pancakes. I love having a variety of different foods to eat in one breakfast plate, with a combination of sweet and savory so to me this place got off to a good start. Everything about the savory foods was just as you'd expect to be, nicely seasoned, warm and tasty.   The pancakes were definitely what set Cafe Raymond apart... and no lie my teeth sunk right through the warm pancake immediately upon contact. There were real berries found in the pancake as well, and the pancake tasted fresh, unlike other places where they taste like they have been sitting out for awhile. What I also liked was the fact that the pancake wasn't overly sweet, allowing you to adjust the sweetness to your liking with however much syrup you desire.   This is a place I'd definitely come back to if I have the chance!"}
{"text":"This place was so good! I really wanted the jumbo lump crab eggs Benedict but sadly the last one was sold right before I ordered. I had a delicious omelette instead and my hubby and I split the ricotta blueberry pancakes. They were so fluffy and so good. I'm not a big pancake eater but I'd have them again. Order at the counter and pay for food, it's delivered to your table and you can leave when finished without having to wait for the check. I'll definitely go back. Sandwiches looked awesome and the two guys cooking were so good. Fully seated and they were turning it out as fast as orders came in. Great spot for brunch."}
{"text":"Cheese.  The Steve Urkel food of champions.   I love cheese...so why not put cheese in your pancakes?  Raymond's pancakes are to die for. Thick, uber moist, not too dense, and they contain ricotta cheese. That's the secret ingredient!   We both had the blueberry pancakes, big fat juicy purple blueberries nestled in those luscious ricotta pancakes.  Too die for.   You get one little cup of syrup, it's a buck for n extra syrup. A little ridiculous.   The orange juice was really wonderful. We both agreed that we were not expecting to be wowed by orange juice, but it was super tasty.   The bacon was thick, perfectly cooked and meaty.   I'm so glad we ducked in to his place. Nice decor, good seating in and out. We ate at a little table on the sidewalk. Nice, busy vibe happening on the strip.   Inside they had a great display of pastries. Wish I would've had some room but I was stuffed.   Everyone loves Raymond's."}
{"text":"Had the veggie wrap and the roasted zucchini, eggplant and mushrooms were incredible. A must visit if you're walking down the strip"}
{"text":"Had great reviews on Yelp so decided to check it while in town for a Steelers game. Line was out the door but it moved fast. Service was friendly and quick. Orange juice was overpriced in my opinion. I was kicking myself after realizing there was lemon water for free. But I digress. The fat boy burger looked phenomenal. Juices and sauces flowed. My sausage egg and cheese was huge and delicious. Someone else got the crab eggs Benedict special which he enjoyed. Everyone cleared their plates. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I'm going back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim for lunch and wow am I happy we did! So good!!  When you walk in you order off a board and then they serve your food for you. They have a wide range of sandwiches and salads as well as coffee and bakery treats! They also serve breakfast all day. I hear the pancakes are delicious. Everything here seems to be made fresh including their baked goods, chips and bread.  I decided to get the club sandwich which was turkey breast, hickory smoked bacon, muenster, spring mix, tomato, avocado spread & chipotle aioli on whole wheat. I had no bacon on mine but she put it on the side for my husband! The sandwich was spicy and had such a good taste. I also had the side salad with a lemon vinaigrette. It was a nice leafy salad and the dressing had a good flavor that complimented the salad and red onions on it well. The chips that come with your sandwich are also homemade. They are a crisp ruffle chip. Plus I could not leave without trying an oatmeal raisin cookie! SO moist and fresh!!  The service was super friendly and everything was quick. Definitely a nice spot in the strict to grab lunch and a tasty Sammy!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast or lunch in the Strip District. Located on Penn Ave. Food ordered and paid for at the counter and brought out to you when it is ready. Prices maybe a few dollars more than I would have expected for this type of set up but it was very good so I don't really mind that. My husband and I ate for $29.00. Not huge inside so I could imagine it would get very busy on the weekends here. Business appeared clean. Restrooms for customers in the basement.   My husband had the blue cheese burger which he said was really good. Came with side of chips. The blueberry ricotta pancakes were fabulous and I highly recommend them to anyone who likes pancakes! The omelette was also excellently made with the perfect ratio of ingredients to eggs.   Looking forward to coming back and trying one of their speciality sandwiches or salads!"}
{"text":"I pop into Cafe Raymond if I'm hungry and strapped for time or if I'm too lazy to wait for a table at one of the more divey Strip District diners. You can get in and out of here fairly quickly. You order and pay at the counter and then take a number to your table. Food usually arrives within 10 minutes.   I really love the new location. It's much roomier than the last space. Much more seating too!    Now you may think that $10 for a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich is pretty outrageous. That is, until you experience said breakfast sandwich. There's practically an entire omelet and a half pound of sausage on that sandwich. The lemon ricotta pancakes are also well worth the dough. Yum!   My usual go-to is the ham and Gruyere on a croissant. It's consistently delicious and the croissants are some of the best in town. The side potatoes are less consistent. Sometimes they are perfect, sometimes burnt, and sometimes overly salted. Potatoes are pretty much my favorite food group and a burnt potato is better than no potato so I'm not too bothered by the inconsistency.   I'm always pleased with my experience here. It's a great Strip District restaurant option!"}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here last week. The blueberry ricotta pancakes that draw so many to this cafe are delicious--sweet, crispy at the edges, fluffy pancakes brimming with large and juicy blueberries. I don't usually get pancakes out because I make great pancakes, but I was pleased my daughter found the reviews of these and convinced me to share them with her. We also shared some eggs with cheddar cheese, served with a toasted ciabatta roll. It's supposed to be a sandwich on a croissant but they were very nice about changing it the way we requested (it wasn't a busy weekend morning). For tea drinkers they carry Harney & Sons teas, which is a nice touch. It's in bags rather than loose leaf, but I know there aren't a LOT of tea drinkers around here, so I am accustomed to it--it was just nice to have a decent tea with my brunch. I'd return for the pancakes--they're definitely better than most you'd get in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for breakfast and it's amazing.  The seating is packed but they help you find a table and the food is consistently great.  The croissant sandwiches are excellent, but seriously get a pastry!"}
{"text":"Great find for a late brunch! We arrived around 1pm on a Sunday, but there was plenty of room to sit. Folks weren't hanging around; which made it easy to grab a table. We ordered the Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes and two egg breakfast. First off, they must be serving dinosaur eggs, because it was huge! They had to have added cream or something too, because there was a distinct creamy flavor to them. Very hearty and delicious! It was served with a side of toast, herb dusted potatoes and thick smoky bacon...yummo! The pancakes were like a dream :) Fluffy, sweet and oh so scrumptious! It was like blueberry birthday cake for breakfast. My only complaint was the tight quarter's, but it's old city row house style...not their fault. Service was excellent though, so i will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here a few weeks back and I have to say it was delicious!  I had a roast beef sandwich and even took the other half to work the next day and it was just as tasty!  My husband insists it was the best burger he ever had. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning we got a late start but came up this way on a recommendation from love. This spot is located in a very fun area in the strip district where there's old warehouses, fun shops and open air markets. So as a fan of all three- I was in heaven. We came up this way and at first struggled with parking and a decent traffic flow, but managed to snag a spot and do some walking. Upon walking in we were greeted and explained how things work- order up front and scoop a table. Decor is very barn style and colorful with different chairs, looks of wood etc.   They serve breakfast all day, which is a huge plus for me personally. I could eat breakfast all year. However, from looking at the menu they all have salads and sandwiches and plenty to choose from. Not to mention homemade scones, cookies, and pastries up front as well. Man man man.  We ordered some breakfast and coffee and tea respectively- and took our seat and hung out. Planning your day over coffee while waiting for breakfast is low key my favorite activity on a Saturday so this hit the spot.   Food was INCREDIBLE. I went with the omelette with bacon cheese and spinach. It was quite possibly the largest, thiccest, fluffiest omelette I have had. Also- was served with home fries which I didn't see on menu. Another added plus. Home fries had a nice flavor and kick to them, and condiments are available on the table.   Coffee was good as well- though I would've liked to have more options on dressing it besides just room temp half and half.   Great spot. I love it and you and I will be back."}
{"text":"Very solid location for lunch or late breakfast. I order from here on the go on a semi regular basis. Good salads, good sandwiches, and above all - quality food. Placed right in the heart of the strip district this place makes the best BLT I've had around the city."}
{"text":"\"All star brunch/lunch place with amazing food and great vibe\"  You order and pay by the counter, then seat yourself at any open table. We didn't have to wait in line but once it was around noon, the whole place was packed with people and there was a line up to the door.   Looked like they had sandwiches and other menus but we wanted to try their breakfast menus. Food portions are pretty decent so you won't be leaving this place hungry.  Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes ($9): I am not a pancake person. But this might be the BEST PANCAKES I've ever had in my life. Ricotta cheese makes the texture so soft and creamy! Seriously you will regret not getting this.  French Toast ($9): Four pieces of toasts with strawberry glaze sauce on top. The sauce almost tastes like strawberry pur√©e or smoothie. It doesn't taste artificially sweet and really adds that natural sour-sweet to the dish.  Omelette ($10): Omelette with three ingredients from their list. We picked bacon, swiss cheese, and mushroom. Comes with a side of roasted potatoes. If you are a savory breakfast person, this would be a good dish to go with."}
{"text":"This is a review for the \"private events\" floor of Cafe Raymond!   My friend graduated from law school and hosted a graduation party on the second floor. This room appeared to be specifically designed for private events. The space was large enough to fit 50-75 people, yet cozy enough to create a warm, intimate feel.   The highlight of the space was the attached balcony seating that overlooks the Strip District. It was the perfect place to admire the hustle and bustle of the busy streets below.   The food was delicious - a wide variety of sandwiches, fruits, pasta salads, bacon covered shrimp etc.  It was the perfect location for a celebration. I would highly recommend booking this location for future events"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences ever, the food is so basic, nothing is especial about this place, it's kind of overpriced (we paid $40 for two). They weren't clear about pricing either. The menu says $9.99 with the choice of meat but you find out later from the bill that they charge you extra for the meat!!! I ordered two eggs breakfast with chicken, but chicken was simply boiled and tasteless , I could not even touch it. The coffee was even worse than the ones you get from creepy gas stations, the egg did not have salt on it, there was only 6 pieces of home fries, I will never try this restaurant anymore. The only reason I gave two stars was for their friendly staff."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot with great food and service! Went twice on our trip. The smoked salmon with homemade ciabatta was crazy good and my husbands egg sandwich was great too. Side of potatoes were super crispy-def on point. Would recommend."}
{"text":"You order at the counter when you enter, then sit and wait for your food. Service was good though I don't like having to tip when ordering before I've even tasted the food or experienced the service. I ordered more than I should have. Eggs over beef brisket hash was excellent. The menu says fried eggs but you can get them scrambled instead. Also ordered the French toast which was a large portion of thick toast drenched in strawberry compote with blueberries. The flavor of the strawberries overpowered everything else. I considered ordering the blueberry ricotta pancakes but I can't eat dairy so I skipped it but it's labeled vegan which I don't understand. Good meal overall. Paid twice what I would have next door at Delucas but it was worth it."}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday. The service was quick for a Monday. They had plenty of people working. I ordered the Ni√ßoise salad. The lemon dressing was refreshing. The salad was huge. I was only able to eat half. They have great prices for lunch and quick service. This is the second time I've been here and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Ended up going to Cafe Raymond with my fianc√© after we saw the lines for DeLuca's and Pamela's were both out the door.  It was a pleasant surprise! There was no wait and we walked right in, placed our order and grabbed a seat. We enjoyed some biscotti and coffee while we were waiting on our orders. I ordered the special of the day, which was the Southern Style Eggs Benedict, and she ordered an omelet. Our food arrived quickly and we both enjoyed it! The service was excellent as well. If you are down in the Strip, stop in and grab a good breakfast at Cafe Raymond, especially if you don't feel like waiting in a long line!"}
{"text":"The better choice over many places in the Strip. Excellent food and a very proficient system to order, pay for and be seated, even when there are long lines waiting to get in. Even does BYOB for a $5 charge."}
{"text":"Walked in and could smell the beard and cookies baking...Oh so Nice!   If you are looking for an enjoyable meal with food made from scratch with fresh products, this is the place.  The menu has breakfast (I think served until 11am), salads, burgers and sandwiches.  I ordered the Prosciutto sandwich that had fresh mozzarella, pesto, olive tapenade, roasted peppers on home baked ciabatta.  Delicious!  The meat and cheese were so good and the olive tapenade and roasted peppers added a wonderful flavor.  The sandwich came with a pickle wedge and some potato chips.  For some reason, this potato chip hound was not a fan of the potato chips.  Not sure of the brand or if in house but think they were bought not make in house.   Someone in our group ordered a salad, that has huge and looked to be very fresh ingredients.    Service was very friendly.  You order at the counter by the door and they give you a number for the food to be delivered.  After delivery, we were asked a couple of times how everything was and the staff seemed to make sure everyone at all the tables and take out orders were happy and received great service.  Cafe Raymond has been on my list to visit for years and will make sure I have a return visit in the near future."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for a Saturday brunch in the strip district. You walk in and wait in line to order so you have plenty of time to peruse the menu on paper and whiteboard. I ordered the Rueben and coffee... my friend ordeeed pa   the Rueben minus the meat. Both were delish. I would rate mine as perhaps the best I've ever had. I can say without reservation that I will be here again"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great value. We came for breakfast and I had an omelette with bacon, mushrooms and gruyere. It was wonderful and I could only finish half it was so large. My bf had blueberry ricotta pancakes and they were amazing as well. Definitely recommend  Cafe Raymond for breakfast!"}
{"text":"My son invited me here to have lunch with him since he works nearby. Located in the 20th block of Penn Ave Cafe Raymond is a small restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch. You basically order at the counter, choose a seat and you are given a number for your order that you take to the table.  Most items on the menu are ala carte with the exception of their special combinations. I decided to order the cooked vegetables on foccata bread, My son ordered the Cafe Raymond burger special that comes with a choice of side and dessert. He ordered a side salad and a red velvet cookie. All sandwiches come with potato chips. Bottled water and other beverages are located in the refrigerator behind you that you can help yourself and pay for it.  We had our food in record time. My vegetable sandwich was so rich and filling I was amazed I could even finish it. It was so good! My son's burger came topped with an egg as well as your usual toppings. He told me he loved every bite of it. He also ordered for dessert a red velvet cookie which is his favorite. He loved that too!  Outside seating is available if you want to sit out on a hot day. Bike parking is nearby and you probably would do well to park on Smallman St and walk over. Please note that reception is bad in the place and there is no free  Wi Fi.  I was thrilled to have my first experience here and am looking forward to trying out their other offerings. Believe me you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"If you're in strip district, come here! Amazing breakfast. Better than waiting forever to go to Pamela's. Sit on the balcony, and enjoy the views. Everything was good! Try the blueberry ricotta pancakes!!! Delicious"}
{"text":"This is review is based off their old location.   My wife and I were trying to meet up with some friends at Pamela's for brunch on a Sunday. The wait time was too long, so we got on Yelp to see what was near by. We choose Cafe Raymond. This was a great place to get brunch. Very cute place with a nice theme. I ordered the Ciabatta & Lox - NY acme salmon, cream cheese, capers, red onion, cucumber, tomato. It was a really good sandwich. Plenty of salmon to accompany the rest of the meal. It also came with a side of breakfast potatoes. I was not expecting much from these but they were great. They were not mushy, which was what i expected. Overall a great find if you are in the Strip District."}
{"text":"This is a must while in the Strip! Food is crazy good! If they have the Curry Chicken Wrap on the menu, that is the one to get!"}
{"text":"WOW!  I am not even joking, the blueberry ricotta pancakes were the best pancakes of my life. Not gonna lie, the ricotta kind of scared me at first because I didn't want cheesy pancakes. But it made the texture of the pancakes SO FLUFFY! It was almost creamy actually. You can't really taste the cheese because it is so blueberry-y but not overly sweet. A must get.  And I got an omelet. It was also SO FLUFFY! It was super thick- almost like an egg cake/souffle type dish. I had it filled with bacon, swiss cheese, and mushrooms and was pleasantly surprised because it wasn't too salty. Just perfect.   Definitely come here if you're ever in Pittsburgh! Make sure to get here kind of early too because it gets very busy!"}
{"text":"I will keep this short since are so many other good reviews about this place. The portions are large service is solid and the menu is tasty. Oh and one more thing, the pancakes are delicious"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast one weekday when they were just opening and we had the place to ourselves. Everyone who works there is super friendly! You order at the counter and then seat yourself, but they bring the food out to you. I had the lox platter and it was very good - the smoked salmon was fresh and they gave plenty of toppings. Well worth the price! Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  The breakfast pastries are amazing! I recommend the blueberry ricotta pancakes.  Service was great, very friendly."}
{"text":"The blueberry ricotta pancakes will change your life. Best ever. We also ordered a BLT that my friend said was great, an omelet, and French toast. All were fantastic. The only thing I didn't love was having to get our own beverages. I had my hands full and would prefer to have someone do that and offer refills. Great place and nice staff"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were checking out the Strip,  when we peeped into Cafe Raymond and instantly knew we had to eat there. The atmosphere was so welcoming and the people were very friendly. We were recommended the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes and the French Toast so that's exactly what we did!  We were able to seat ourselves. It being somewhat crowded, we decided to sit outside, which is fine by me because who doesn't enjoy people watching? Haha anyway, we were served in about 15 minutes and I myself was taking back by how pretty the dishes looked. People walking by seemed to agree because our dishes were getting many stares and comments on how good they looked. Luckily for us, we were able to try let and OH MY GOD. I enjoyed my French Toast very much so but these Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes will change your mind about any other pancake you've ever had. Hands down my favorite Pancakes I've ever tried!"}
{"text":"Cafe Raymond is my \"go to\" breakfast spot. I know I can depend on them for great food and good service.  The omelettes are excellent, so are their pan fried potatoes.   I like ordering at the cashier station, and then finding a table, the food seems to arrive faster that way.   This is a great spot to breakfast with friends."}
{"text":"Great little place. Fun service and good food. It's in the Strip District which is a really fun area. The salmon plate was very good according to my boss. My eggs and sausage was good. The red potatoes were a nice touch.  Treat yourself to this fun place."}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast stop today. Had the omelet with spinach ,red peppers and cheddar cheese, very good sized and very tasty. The potatoes were really good, cooked perfectly and not dried out at all. Toast was extra but it was just simple toast. Challah french toast wad the winner here with 4 large halves of toast with fruit and whipped cream. It was made perfectly,  not mushy at all and neither was it too crispy, it was just right! Good coffee and lots of bottled drinks to pick from as well. I can't wait to try it out for lunch sometime soon."}
{"text":"I love a good lunch spot and this is a great one. Simple and starlight forward, we ordered and paid at the counter since all the tables were full and by the time we sat down our meal was delivered. We got drinks out of the cooler at the front of the restaurant and an extra bag of New Orleans chips as a side since they are a rarity to find in pgh. I've  had their catering on multiple occasions in the past but had never visited be cafe. This weekend we found ourselves in the strip looking for a good sandwich and I'm so glad we chose cafe Raymond. I had the turkey club which came with roasted potatoes, and it was great. The quantify and quality of my meal definitely met my expectations. The salads and baked goods also looked delicious as many people were eating both of them around me. I'm looking forward to the next time I stop in for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Wow - best kept little secret in the Strip District!!!!  Great food, great service, great prices!!!!!  Had lunch there today with 2 friends - we were all delighted with the experience!!!  Definitely will eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food.  My girlfriend said the quiche was great (5/5) and the potatoes were horrible (0/5).  I ordered two scrambled eggs (5/5), sausage (2/5), wheat toast and their potatoes (0/5).  First I must say kudos to the sous-chef since I believe she made the eggs.  They were cooked *perfectly* without any scorching.  The sausage was in a flattened patty that was overcooked and hard to cut with a fork.  It was pretty nasty and I will not order it again.  The potatoes were even worse; flavorless and dried out.  I believe they make them by the pan and keep them in an oven, sometimes mixing the old pan with the new.  I say this because some were cooked correctly and others were shriveled, black and all moisture was burnt out of them.  Chef Raymond or Management needs to investigate the potato situation because they were a 0/5 in my rating system as well.  Our total bill with drinks was around $25.  $25 for two breakfasts should be astounding food in my opinion.  It was not."}
{"text":"Since the move, Cafe Raymond is a go to destination for the best eats in the Strip.  They have the best the strip has to offer then cranked up the volume which the prices reflect that at an acceptable level.  What keeps me returning to a restaurant is that one good item, a diverse menu that takes me to a different place with each visit or a good deal, aka cheap.  Cafe Raymond has the diverse menu I plan to travel through on each visit.  They also have a great special every day that is not on the menu which is always a great detour.  I also love the counter ordering, makes lunch visits so much more efficient and you are not worrying about paying the bill while you enjoy your meal.  I also feel that this is one of those places that if there is something you usually do not like, you will like it here, basically there is not a bad thing on the menu."}
