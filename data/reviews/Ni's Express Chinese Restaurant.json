{"text":"This is one of the best American-Chinese take-out restaurants I've ever been too. Every time I take out from this place, the staff is super nice, the food is prepared extremely quickly, and tastes fantastic. I never leave reviews for places but figured I would because somehow this place is coming up as a 2-star restaurant on Yelp and that is simply mind boggling. This take-out place is leaps and bounds better than the other Chinese take-out places in the area and I look forward to enjoying my meal every time I'm in the mood for some good Chinese food. The prices are great, and did I mention the staff is super nice? Great place that I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Second time there. Second time screwed up our order. No rice with the meal? Come on. Food was good but two mess ups is enough for me."}
{"text":"My order was wrong so now I given them 1 star for all there great work. Everything was spilled in the bag."}
{"text":"Typical American take out Chinese, they are cheap and fast always my go-to since they are close . The young girl now answers the phone and takes payment at the counter, she is super sweet and always courteous. If you want some Chinese take out I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Our order was wrong, so after waiting for about 10 minutes our order came out. Wrong again. The \"beef\" in our beef and mixed vegetables was most certainly never part of a cow, and the General Tso's chicken was dice sized bits of mostly breading and tasted vaguely of bleach. The fried rice was of the boxed variety, the wonton soup tasted like aluminum can, it took multiple attempts to get correct change, and they forgot our eggrolls. Don't waste your time. There are half a dozen decent chinese takeout places within 5 minutes of here. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Always get my Chinese takeout from here. Major plus is they deliver and are efficent. Good vegetarian options and the price is right, too. Their lo mein is excellent. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"The food has really gone downhill.  We ordered the general tso chicken and it was 95% breading.  The sauce on Szechuan beef tasted of ketchup.  Egg rolls are so-so. While this is close to us, we will be making the trek to Mandarin House from now on."}
{"text":"Your typical Chinese Takeout.  Solid and good.  I always get takeout so I cannot comment on their delivery.  But they are always quick to make the good (usually 10-15 minutes tops) where its hot and ready to be picked up after calling it in.  Also, for lunch, you cannot beat the portions they give you off their Lunch Specials menu for less than $5.  Best deal in town.  One thing to note, IMO, even though for the most part this is your standard Chinese takeout, they do have the best Hot & Sour soup in all of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for delivery on a random Thursday night. I was hoping for something decent based on the other reviews but this was inedible. Rice was hard and under cooked. The egg rolls were a greasy mess cooked in old oil no doubt. The sweet and sour chicken was tough and doughy. (Not easy to do!) The chicken in my fried rice was undercooked and pink. This was a disaster. McDonalds would be more expensive and better quality than this. (Our bill for everything was $13.)"}
{"text":"Great Chinese Food! Highly recommend. My favorite in the Parma area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for take out last night.  Food was good, especially the moo shu pork, although the sweet & sour pork did not have any vegetables in it.  We ordered the fried wontons, but they were nasty, fried to a crisp and inedible, we threw those away.  Vegetable lo mein and egg rolls were pretty good too.    Service was terrible, however.  The owner's teenage daughter took my order, in between screaming fights with her parents back in the kitchen.  I waited for my order, and they fought constantly while I was there.    The daughter also had a really bad attitude while taking my order.  While I was waiting for my order,  she spent her time crying and stabbing cardboard boxes with a ruler.    I would order again, but the family dysfunction was really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Helpful and smiling staff. Excellent taste. Lots of food. Outstanding value. Nice job.  The Hunan beef had a wonderful flavor."}
{"text":"This is our usual Asian food place,  but honestly the food quality varies.  Recently we've had really good food here, but tonight it was just okay.  The egg rolls were mostly wrapping,  very little filling.  Usually the egg rolls are the best part of the meal.  Let's hope it's not always going to be this way. The veggie lo mein is always delicious, highly recommend it.  I do love that they deliver!"}
{"text":"Honestly the food is fantastic. But I will never order food from nor refer this establishment ever. One reason: the man who answers the phone to take orders when you call in has the snarkiest, most A-Hole response/attitude approach of talking to people, calling him rude would be an understatement. Get that guy out of there and maybe I'll do business, but not until then."}
{"text":"Thank YOU Ni's Express delivery man for delivering the hot food to my mother-in-law, Oma. She loved the food. She wasn't feeling well and your food satisfied her and boosted her appetite. I lived many states away but you were able to deliver what I asked and allowed me to pay over the phone. You were so awesome. And thank you for calling to confirm the ordered were being delivered. I was very happy with the result. For the amount of food you gave and the amount of money we spent it was priceless bc it was for good purpose. You made it in perfect time for her dinner too. The food nourished her body and gave her strength to fight the illness she's fighting to rid. Thank you."}
{"text":"Delivered the wrong food and on top of that it tasted like crap! Neither of us ate anymore than 10% of it."}
{"text":"Delivery fail!!  Never had an issue with carry out. It's on my way home from work so I can call in 15 before clock out and its hot and ready when I get there. Delivery was a fail. They use your phone number and if you've just gotten that number they will deliver to the wrong place.  Thats what happened when I ordered delivery. I got a call saying no one was answering the door. I said I would buzz them in. ( I was living in an apartment using a landline phone) buzzed the door. Waited. Again a call. Would I come to the door please. Ok so went down no ones there.  I called the restaurant too see what was wrong.  They were a house a few streets away. Seems my number was once used there.  Finally they got the right address and all was well. If you're ordering delivery please make sure they have the correct address!! The food is good. The wings are whole and can have hair or feathers whatever it is on it still.  The hunan chicken was what I ate back when I ate meat."}
{"text":"We order from here twice or so a month. My wife always get the Worshoo(can't be right) chicken and crab Rangoon. Both are amazing. Tons of gravy on the chicken and they give you a huge container of sweet sauce for the Rangoon. I get something different every time and haven't been upset yet. I like the Szechwan sauce is spicy. I love it. They always say 45 minutes and it's never been more than 25 on delivery times and they're friendly and fast. Now that I think about it we get the same delivery guy all the time and he's also very pleasant. Highly recommend for delivery Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese we've found in our area.  It's not the best we've had, but is consistently fairly good.  The Lo Mein is hands down our favorite menu item.  It is always good.  Other entrees have been hit or miss.  The appetizers are usually just OK.   For quick and easy in the south east Parma area it's good enough.  But bonus points for delivery service!"}
{"text":"Good food. Nothing fancy typical American version of Chinese food. Sally is the awesome little teen gal always friendly and smiles. I tend to be super thirsty after eating here but it's one of the best places in the Parma area!"}
{"text":"I have never stepped foot in this restaurant but ordered a meal here after the person working at the front desk at Hampton Inn recommended this restaurant.   They are prompt with the delivery and they sometimes will make something special to give to the person at the front desk for free! The food has always arrived at a good temperature. Also, the food is pretty good too!   I will definitely order from here again when staying in the area."}
{"text":"Average Chinese takeout place.  Nothing special, but worth a try if you've never been before.  In my opinion no one beats China Express!"}
