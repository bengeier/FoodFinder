{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere here. It's laid back and for the grown and sexy. The Jazz entertainer had a lovely voice and was very personable. The food was excellent. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Very nice, adult atmosphere. Upstairs they played all our favorites Old School RnB (rick james, gap band, ect) downstairs they were having an AfroPop event with vendors, and there is also a patio.  Drinks were nice and the price was good."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for an event. The bartenders were EXTREMELY RUDE. Instead of her acknowledging the customers, she decided to put up every bottle of alcohol without a word. Furthermore, she began to start an altercation with another party guest. I understand you may not enjoy your job but you dont have to be disrespwvrful to those who are patronizing the business. I really like to support local businesses but receiving terrible service makes it really hard. The actual event could have been really nice if it weren't for the unorganization and rudeness of the staff.  Unfortunately,  after that experience I don't think I will be visiting this establishment on purpose again.  It seems like it could have really good potential if the service (attitudes) were better."}
{"text":"This little SpeakEasy is a hidden gem right at Uptown. My husband and I were invited out to hear a friend of mine ,who just relocated to QC from my hometown Chicago, artist perform with a Live Band.   We Love Live music and Live performances so it was right up our alley. The building shares a parking lot with Charter/TWC so it could be confusing as the signs say Charter parking and there is honestly not another parking lot. Once we parked and entered we were assured that the parking was legit in the evenings for the venue.   Upon entering it reminds you of a NYC speakeasy or one of our Hole In the walls in Chicago both are places you have the most fun ever. We had a VIP table with our name and the place was already jammed packed and our Friend artist was on stage. We came right on time and stayed for more as the other acts were amazing. It was a TRUE grown up event and evening and venue.  Not to mention we tried Breadpudding in a lounge and it was surprisingly tasty"}
{"text":"Friday night in Charlotte. The blackened tilapia with fries was well seasoned, the fries were soft in side and perfectly crisp on the outside. The hostess at the door was wonderful and explained the $10 cover charge. The music and acoustics was clear. The performer, Ashanti, was great her band was super duper awesome.  The only thing that was off was the waitress. She didn't appear to want to be here. Maybe she was having a bad day but it felt as if she wanted to be anywhere in the world but not at this jazz bar. I will definitely return when I am in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Had a very bad experience! Drinks were wayyyyy overpriced and wings and food were not good at all will not be returning"}
{"text":"Great evening at Morehead today.  The Makoosa Cookout has the most amazing DJs!!! Can't wait for next year!!!"}
{"text":"They STEAL! I went there for an event on 1/15/17 and used my card to buy a drink and left a cash tip. When I checked my account 3 days later they had took an additional $3! I will never go there again paying cash or otherwise! Spoke with the owner who said he would look into and get back with me. He never did so I went back up there and spoke with Jay who said he was the manager. He had the receipt I signed that showed I clearly marked a zero in the tip space and refused to give me a copy. He is clearly the one who stole my money or covering up for who did. They already charge a $10 cover how greedy can you be!? You can't even support black business because they always try to get over! Smh!"}
{"text":"Nice spot for listening to some really, really good Jazz Bands in Charlotte.  Food was good as well!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am welcomed back. It's nice to have a welcome feeling when I enter. I've been here several times and recommend the wings with Red Hot hot sauce. They also have several events there so it's a community friendly place as well. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Went here for an event that I found on Yelp. It was for the Black Panther and it was so dope. I'm really glad that we got there early because parking was starting to get crazy.   There is something cool about the vibes in Charlotte. It's really sleek and cool. That's what this location reminded me of. It also reminded me of an old school building. Regular business on the first floor, then when you go \"downstairs\" it's a whole party. The life music was so much and I would like to thank JayNelly for the hospitality at this location. She was surely great answering any type of questions that we had."}
{"text":"Went to this venue for an adult game night event and it was definitely easy to get to. The bar staff was very courteous, but the decor and layout was a little weird. I wasn't sure if it was a themed bar/pub or just dated. I'll definitely return for adult game night ."}
{"text":"Experienced Morehead Tavern recently on a whim.  Nice authentic pub decorum. Reminds me of pubs and eateries from Jersey.  Upstairs seemed therapeutic.  But downstairs was another story.  Went for Jazz night, but no jazz??  It was a jam band playing old school hits.  Small dance floor. Service was awful.  Disrespectful management/staff.  Never returning and will advise others against going."}
{"text":"Music was awesome get there @8 if you want a good seat on Friday. We got there at 9 but had to end up seating at a vacant bar inside the room. Only thing we were told we will not get waited on since we were not sitting at a table. But I'm like you placed us here!!!! So got up and went to the other bar to order a drink and some food, the female bartender was rude and told me you have to order the food from a server, which she made me boiling pissed with her tone. Luckily the gentleman begin the bar I believe was a manager or supervisor waited on us and brought our food out."}
{"text":"This place is kind of weird. I appreciate that it's old and has some character, as so much of Charlotte does not, but it's just not doing it right.  I came here recently for a comedy show. It was approximately 130 degrees inside the basement where the show was to be held. It was a cold night outside. I can't imagine what a July show would have felt like.  The entertainers seemed totally thrown off (understandably) by how low the ceiling is in here. I felt like it was really distracting to them throughout the night.  Another distraction stems from the fact that the tables in the reserved seating area are packed so tightly together that the wait staff can barely meander through. I spent half of the night watching them struggle to squeeze in front of and behind the tables.   Biggest drawback? NO LOCAL BEER. Are you kidding me? I legitimately thought our waiter was joking when he started listing off Bud Light and Coors. This is Charlotte, land of a million delicious craft beers. Morehead Tavern seriously can't get on the bandwagon and offer even one? Hugely disappointing.   I'll come back if I have to."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting Morehead Tavern.  The first time I attended was to a networking event a few months ago. On this visit I attended Laff it up Thursday with friends. Our server Charles was very nice and courteous. He had excellent customer service skills. He kept the drinks coming, we didn't have to remind him to keep us stocked. I did not eat on this occasion. The first time I came I had the lemon pepper wings. I had to send them back,  they did not taste like lemon pepper they tasted plain. The server did a good job of taking then back and bringing more. That batch tasted better. I love the hush puppies that comes with the wings. The concerns I have with this place is the ladies and parking. The restroom is soooo small. The lock does not work in one of the restrooms.  It would be helpful to the customers to do some repairs and upgrade. They do not have a lot of parking. I had to pay & park at college and morehead, and walk. I recommend this place if you just want to grab a bite to eat and chill, and don't mind paying for parking."}
{"text":"Bill Hanna friends Jazz Jam is spectacular !!  Just never know who will pop in to sing or play on Tuesday nights 8-11pm. The regulars like Ziad sax man and Andre lead guitar man are some of the best in the state. This is a must if you enjoy Jazz...."}
{"text":"These wings were AMAZING! Large and juicy! Plenty flavors to choose from but I got chipotle honey mustard.... I cannot express to you how delicious these were! I attended a charity event and it was almost enough room for everyone.. decent size dance floor . Our waitress was so cool... they should definitely tip her !"}
{"text":"Good local spot in southend without the typical South end crowd. Good beer and drink prices, surprisingly large venue based on what it looks like from the outside. Some typical bar food options, but good. My go to for a beer and quick food in the neighborhood."}
