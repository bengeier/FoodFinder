{"text":"Great authentic sri Lankan food. Five stars for the food alone!  This place has been there for as long as I remember (myself 10 years in Canada).  I have been going for his rottis ever since.  The rotti is his specialty come with tuna and dry fish sambol. Very cheap and delicious.  They have a full bar and a pool table inside. The owner is the chef and he knows how to rock those spices.  Kothu rotti is crunchy and delicious. Devilled shrimp/prawns goes well with his rotti too.  The place was renovated couple years ago to a more modern atmosphere (the large bulky old HDTV is replaced by flat LCDs)  His seafood party mix which I tried couple times recently. Has chunks of chicken with shrimp etc....which I would also recommend. But try his rotti first.  Plenty of room to dine in. Usually a lot of boys and men hangout there at night.  Many people I talk to haven't heard of this place.  Its at Bromley n eglington I. Scarborough. Please give it a shot! All you spicy lovers....you will not regret!"}
{"text":"One of the few places in Toronto if not the only place that offers true deviled Sri Lankan dishes. If you go you must try the mixed seafood and deviled beef.  Make sure you carefully choose the spice level as it is not for the faint of hurt. If I was home in Sri Lanka this is the type of place I would go with my friends too."}
