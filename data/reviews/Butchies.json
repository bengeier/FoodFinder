{"text":"Great local joint! Menu is simple and food is awesome. The smoked pork shoulder was tender and smokey, paired nicely with the cucumber salad. Had a bite of hubbie's burger, really liked it too, juicy and flavourful! Oh, the Brussel sprouts tasted super yummy too, don't miss it! Gonna make it a regular spot~"}
{"text":"This place serves  darn good food! 
We came here for Saturday dinner;the line up was long but the lady taking the orders was fast. We got the family dinner for 4 people. For $38 it gave us 2 kinds of meat, 3 sides and 4 drinks. We had the southern fried wings & the pulled pork shoulder. For the sides, we tried the mac n cheese, fries & cauliflower casserole. Everything was amazing. The wings were seasoned and fried well. The pulled pork, succulent!
The place was clean and spacious.  The staff were friendly. Our new favourite place! We'll be back for ice cream and pie."}
{"text":"This is our first visit here. It's new and popular and with the amount of people waiting for their orders while sitting at tables, seating is extremely limited (we ate outside where there is overflow picnic tables - hope the rain holds off). And when it's busy you will have to be patient. Due to the design it's awkward to order as well as wait for your order. Another small thing - and it's a review so I will mention it - outdoor garbage was overflowing - but really that's a small thing and understandable. Because we ate outside we had to have everything in to-go containers adding to waste and garbage. Also parking can be a Gong Show. Our meals all came without napkins... small things.
The good: staff is friendly, they brought our order ($$) outside to where we were sitting. The food....the food is fresh and excellent, it's obvious why there are so many people here. So yes - the food is a must stop place to eat. The pies look homemade and the ice cream is just fantastic. Great people restaurant with a great story.
We are local - walking distance so we will definitely return. I would recommend this to friends. We wish this local business a success and look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. The first time I ordered the smoked pork shoulder and two sides: fries and Mac and cheese. I got the pork shoulder on a bun with extra BBQ sauce on the side. I got to say, the pork shoulder was juicy and extremely delicious, cooked to perfection. The mac and cheese side was tasty. Not quite macaroni pasta but that didn't matter. Loved the fries too, thick and fried just right. I also loved how they give you thick sliced pickles and pickled onions as well.

The second time I went I ordered the half BBQ chicken and two sides: hush puppies and cod fritters. The chicken was juicy, delicious and not dry at all. Loved the skin..seasoned so well. The hush puppies are to die for. Three big yummy portions that compliment the meat so well. The cod fritters were excellent as well. I think I'll continue to come here and try some other delicious items.

So many delicious sides that compliment the meats. It seems as if some of the meats are rotated out, which I think is great but if you are looking forward to something you had last time it might not be there that day. Maybe you can request it, if its not written on the chalk board menu. Also, Kawarthas Dairy ice-cream here as well. Lots of benches outside for those beautiful sunny days. Excellent spot, I highly recommend to anyone who loves BBQ and comfort food in general."}
{"text":"This place is going to be adding a lot of fat to my waistline in the future! Hubby and I went here after hearing good things from friends. I ordered smoked wings with a side of hushpuppies and cucumber salad and a root beer float which was on special for only $3. My husband ordered country fried steak with hushpuppies and mac and cheese. 

The wings were so tasty! Smoky and buttery. The hushpuppies were crispy and salty on the outside and soft inside. The cucumber salad was really good. If you like cucumbers, you need to try it! 

My husband's country fried steak was better than any other I've tried. The mac and cheese was delicious too. 

I'll definitely be back to try some pie and some of the other meat options. It all looked amazing! They also carry Kawartha Dairies ice cream, so bonus points for that!"}
{"text":"After waiting 20 minutes from placing my order, Burger was over cooked, my wifes chicken wings were rubbery.  Not impressed at all. Bring back shake rabble and I'll be back, otherwise it is a total miss."}
{"text":"Butchie's was a disappointment.  We came for a Sunday family dinner.  The menu looked promising and the atmosphere was bright and modern.  The staff was welcoming and extremely helpful, especially when helping my kids figure out what to order.  The only problem was the food.  The chicken fingers, country style wings and country fried steak were crusted in a coating that was too salty and way overcooked.  The pulled pork was bland, even with the bbq sauce that tasted suspiciously like watered down HP sauce.  The macaroni and cheese was tasty and creamy, but the breadcrumb topping had burnt in places, and the acrid flavour was a bit of a shock every few bites.  Not to mention the caramelized Brussels sprouts that were raw on the inside and burnt on the outside.  I would really like to see a local business like this succeed, but not with this quality of food."}
{"text":"Butchies really deserves the high praise it seems to be getting on here.  We decided to give it a shot and were really happy with the quality and portion of food we received.  We've eaten there multiple times and and both always enjoyed their food and portion included.  Prices are a little high but as I've said you do get a lot of food."}
{"text":"Finally..... A freshly made Burger in Durham.  I visited Sunday at 8pm and the time I waited was approximately 15 minutes. I ordered the burger with fries for my wife, and I ordered the Mack and Cheese. We both shared the sides. The Mack and Cheese and fries were very good. The bun Fresh and lightly toasted. I don't think the burger is more than 4-5oz. I would like to have more of a patty. I feel that the bun should not exceed the patty. That being said.... price is fair, burger and sides reflect that price. I would definitely return to try their other sides... and would have room for their pies. Elwood would be proud. No more visits to Pete. Good job Chef."}
{"text":"Butchie's is amazing. Great fries, amazing pulled pork and sausage, and their house salad is one of the best lunches in Durham right now."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Damn UNTASTY food. The burger was blah, country fried steak was tasteless and nothing at all special about the chicken. Cucumber salad side was served in a tiny gravy cup. Food served on steel trays with paper liner...nothing like cutting into your food and eating some paper with it! Prices are way too high for the quality of food. Even the ice cream portion was disappointing. For $4...it was the size of a baby cone. My family's first and last visit."}
{"text":"My partner and I love it here - we drive in from Toronto just to get our Butchies fix! Smoked Pork Shoulder is delicious & their sides are super yummy. I'm glad they've increased the size of their mac and cheese - it's really delicious. Portions are generous and I love that they have a sustainable fish option.  Can't wait to go back. Also - PIES! So good."}
{"text":"My wife and I were eager to visit Chef Andrea Nicholson's restaurant ever since we saw the sign. It's about time that Durham has a Top Chef and we certainly weren't disappointed! Everything was absolutely delicious. We each tried a Meat + 3 combo. I had smoked pork shoulder with 3 sides ... hand-cut fries, hush puppies and Baba's cucumber salad. I loved the pork shoulder ... it was perfectly smoked, tender and not smothered in BBQ sauce like most other places. My wife had the smoked half chicken with caramelized brussel sprouts, braised red cabbage and fries. Her meal was equally tasty ... I even liked her brussel sprouts. We were also pleased to hear that the pies are nut free, but didn't have enough room left so will have to try that on our next visit. 

I strongly encourage people to try out this restaurant and look forward to some of the interesting things that Andrea has planned for the restaurant."}
{"text":"One is the lowest I can give , it should rate 0

Went in for their meat plus 1 ,  which is a burger and fries - up charged to a poutine for a extra 3$ and threw a slice of cheese in the burger for a extra buck ...
Figured if the food is good , price is accordingly 

Received food in a metal tray ... not ideal but okay for a burger , but do good for a steak or such 

Burger was raw , approached the owner who replied they have a habit of cooking their meat 
Medium rare ... ?? 
Poor excuse for a under cooked item 

Will not go back at all"}
{"text":"I was in the Whitby area and wanted to try this place. Having some higher expectations of this place, I wasn't disappointed.

I decided to have the meat and two sides option for $14. I had the slow cooked pork shoulder with Brussels Sprouts and the hush puppies.

The pork was really good, tender and lightly seasoned. The Brussels Sprouts were roasted and seasoned with salt and the hushpuppies reminded me of a sweet cornbread that was deep fried. It also comes with a mustard mayo dip.

All the food combinations matched together perfectly and I really enjoyed my meal. I thought the food combinations would be too greasy, but it wasn't at all. 

The portions were good and the staff were very helpful and sweet. Next time I want to come back and try the shakes and other sides."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, everything was clean and organized.

It took me a long time to finally decide what to order. I tried the country fried steak, mac and cheese and Brussel sprouts and everything was delicious! The mac and cheese is probably the best I've ever had. (I'm not a fan of mac and cheese).

The only thing I would change is the paper underneath the steak. It's inevitable to cut while cutting the steak and the steak ends up on the tray.

Pie was okay and Kawartha ice cream is always good"}
{"text":"Been here many times with my family and we enjoy the burgers, ribs and pretty much everything on the menu. And the owner Andrea is awesome very friendly and always speaks with the customers."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place! They did a great job revamping the spot to make it clean and modern, while keeping the diner feel. 

Butchies is the southern comfort food we have been missing in Durham Region. Most places are all about the barbecue, but the chef has done a great job offering items that other BBQ joints and other restaurants don't, thus making it a smart unique selling point. With items like country fried steak and hush puppies, it takes me back to trips to the U.S. 

Specialty bottled root beers are pricey ($4.75) so you might want to stick with fountain pop ($2.25).

The smoked pork shoulder was tender, but it needed more smoke flavour and heavier seasoning. The BBQ sauce on the table helped!

The sides were good. Really enjoyed the mac & cheese, green beans, and hush puppies. I was pretty disappointed with the devilled eggs though. Nothing like the ones in the website photos. I can make them better and more flavourful. 

Overall, I am happy with the experience. Maybe next time I'll try the pie! Also, the service is good so make sure to tip!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I've been to in a long time...the menu is awesome I want to try everything on it...I had the chicken fried steak and it was perfect...the hush puppies omg good ...clean great service 5+++++++"}
{"text":"Amazing food and cashier was super friendly and informative. Hush puppies and brussell sprouts were delicious. Simple food made right. Pork belly bites were yummy."}
{"text":"Love this diner! The food is amazing and the staff is really friendly. People looking to save a buck because it's a diner should go elsewhere--this is high-quality soul food."}
{"text":"Great home style food. Good portions and friendly staff. Wish there were more seats though."}
{"text":"Drove past this place many times since the old diner closed and was wondering what it was about. Went in tonight to give it a try. Loved the menu was small and easy to read- the list of sides was impressive and the staff was welcoming. I ordered the 1/2 chicken with the mac n cheese and fries and my love had the pork shoulder with the cauliflower and we each had a drink... you can tell a lot of hard work goes into the food but found the sides to be very small and the drinks expensive at $2.25 for fountain pop. The fries were amazing- and the bbq sauce on the table mmmm...I almost would have rathered drank that than my pop! I hope the business does well, will return again as we are both very interested in trying their salads."}
{"text":"Enjoyed delivery from Skip the Dishes.  Everything was very tasty! The half chicken was delicious.  The hot Nashville chicken sandwich was spicy but great. The sides were so good ... the Brussels sprouts, chip-truck style fries, Mac&cheese. 

Reminded me of southern cooking. So tasty!"}
{"text":"Overall it was a good experience.  The service was friendly, the restaurant was clean with plenty of space and you don't feel crammed in at all like some restaurants these days.  It's especially good because the old restaurant in this spot had tiny booths.   Butchie's has nice spacious tables.  

As for the food it was good.  I ordered the \"Meat + 1\" which for me was a burger and fries.   The fries are GREAT honestly the 2nd best fries I've had in all of Durham Region.   The burger was good.   They use some sort of spice in the meat which gives it a bold flavor which I wasn't a huge fan of.   I'm more of a just the meat alone kind of guy but it was fine.   The only thing was it seemed a tad overdone.  I know you can't get medium rare burger in Canada but it seemed more well done that most.   Fresh ingredients though.  Bacon and cheese were really good.    If I had one concern is that the drink is quite small.  A fountain soda is $2.25 and it's the size of a can of pop but with ice in it.   Since the food is freshly made it take awhile so you are almost done your drink by the time the food gets there.  

I'll definitely go back to Butchie's  in the near future I'll just have one of the other items on the menu with those tasty fries."}
{"text":"Overall a disappointing experience, here are the details...


Let's start with what was good...
- Great concept, marketing and feel for the restaurant
- Simple streamlined menu and the branding of 'Meat + 3'
- Interesting sides
- The Chicken Fried Steak was pretty good
- Mac n Cheese and Hush Puppies also good


Now... the not so good...
- Poor service, people were unfriendly both at the cash and bringing the food to the table

- The environment is very loud and has a lot of echo.  While the renovations of the new restaurant are well done, it's very open, cold feeling, no warmth.

- They don't provide a list of burger toppings that you can review.  Instead they just say what's available making it very difficult to remember.  As a result you feel rushed while trying to order.

- Burger was average at best, and some toppings I ordered were missing.

- Fries were VERY dark and undercooked

- Devilled eggs were very salty

- All food is served on a piece of parchment paper, on top of a stainless steel tray.  For the most part this is fine, looks pretty good.  But putting a steak on a piece of paper just didn't work, especially when you're trying to cut into it.  The paper tears and now your concerned with either eating the paper, or worried that the tray may not be clean and your food is now touching it.


Saying all that, I do think the place has potential.  But from the experience I had, the place is currently not managed or staffed well.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I only recently heard about Butchies and I knew we had to visit. I love Top Chef (the show) and always rooted for Andrea - I was excited to check out her restaurant. 

The place is clean and comfortable and the staff is so nice. All of them!  We felt very welcomed. Andrea and her staff make a point to come out to the tables at least once or twice to see how things are.  It was really nice and did not feel intrusive at all. 

The food:  I had the buttermilk fried chicken fingers, my H had the ribs and buttermilk fried wings and my son had the burger. For sides I ordered the green beans and Mac and cheese. Everything was damn tasty, as promised. The fries were hand cut and reminded me of a chip truck. Perhaps I came in with lower expectations bc I don't think bbq restaurants are all that exciting. It's clear that Butchies puts a ton of thought and love into the food. I also enjoyed the house ketchup that you find at the table. Nice touch. 

I'm looking forward to coming back again. This place is way better than any other bbq I've tried in the GTA. All around - a great experience.  5 stars because it's rare when all the things - service, atmosphere and food, are to notch."}
{"text":"My new favourite! I had the  hot Nashville chicken sandwich (spicy!) and cucumber salad, my wife had the cheeseburger and hand cut fries. We washed everything down with milkshakes (don't be a hater!). Everything was really, really, really good, I like it a lot (had to steal a line from dumb and dumber!)."}
{"text":"I had not heard of this restaurant but pulled into the parking lot to make a phone call. Then looked at the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try. 
Service was fast and friendly and helpful in deciding on dishes to order.
The chicken on a bun was spectacular. It might have a little too much hot sauce for some, but I loved it. The fries are hand-cut, and cooked perfectly. And I took the mac & cheese side home to my wife who loved it.
I can't wait to go back and try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Came to visit Canada and a friend of mine works at Butchies told me they have great food. I had fried steak, hush puppies and chicken wings on my first night. And came back for lunch the next day and ordered soup and pulled pork sandwich. I would definitely go back here when I visit again. I wish we had this in California."}
{"text":"The place was clean and staff were friendly and very attentive. Food was good.  Ordered pork shoulder. The one on top was juicy and hot while the bottom part of the pork was cold and dry.  Im guessing they mixed the new batch with the old one.  The fries was soggy for me but the cucumber salad were okay. Though the fried steak was crunchy,  there was more batter than the meat. Over all, if your just hungry and need of a big serving of food,  this is the right place for you."}
{"text":"Very, very good!  Everything was delicious, we ordered the Chicken Wings and the Smoked Pork Shoulder, and they were flavourful and satisfying!  The sides were great as well!
My only regret is that I didn't have any room for the pies, shakes and ice cream!!  Will be back for sure.

Love that it's off the beaten track, feels like a well kept secret.  However I secretly wish there was one closer to me!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first visit to Butchies today. Chef Andrea was nice as can be. I had the pulled chicken sammy, mac and cheese, hush puppies and maple baked beans. Chicken was a little tough and the coleslaw needed a little more acid but the mayo on the side was delish. Mac and cheese could use a little more sharpness but enjoyable. Beans were aces, and hush puppies were nice and moist. I sampled from my dining companions so got to try a bunch of menu items. Chicken fried steak was yummy. Hot Nashville chicken sammy was crunchy and doused in Frank's Red Hot, which is all right by me, but the friend who ordered it didn't like that the slaw was right on the sandwich - made the slaw hot, which defeats the purpose of the cooling slaw. Yams were sweet and sticky, and she enjoyed the mashed. Chicken wings were enormous and looked crispy. Didn't try. Burger looked dry. Ditto. Watermelon salad was lovely. Devilled eggs were disappointingly bland. Food took quite a while to come and it wasn't that busy but it had just opened for the day. Spotlessly clean and liked the minimalist decor/groovy eggplant color palette. Sorely needed in Whitby. Hope she does well. Will be back."}
{"text":"The food was Top Notch. We stopped in for lunch, two of us had Burgers and Fries and one of us had the smoked pork with fries and green beans really delicious definitely will  come back. Lots of parking, it's located right beside a car dealership. They have really good looking ice cream too but we were full after our meal."}
{"text":"I went for the first time yesterday and spent 40 dollars knowing the owner was a late cut just before the finale of top chef Canada. I purchased a full rack of ribs and three sides with a chicken wings special. The sides were the best part of the meal. The Brussels sprouts were excellent as well as the devilled eggs. Seasoned excellently. The mac and cheese was tasty but a little dry. The wings were big, juicy, and tender, however had no flavour. The full rack of ribs were smothered in sauce and were the driest ribs I ever tasted. The meat was extremely over cooked and meat you could bite into like cardboard. I asked for hot sauce for the wings and got franks red with I don't know if anything was added. I have a difficult time understanding how a top chef at their own BBQ place would not have a homemade sauce to compliment their food. I was so disappointed especially when Andrea Nicholson was present at the time. I could never serve ribs that butchered and cost 20 dollars"}
{"text":"This was my third visit this week to a restaurant owned by a chef I've watched and admired on The Food Network. It wasn't planned that way and my journey wasn't driven by their celebrity status but merely by my geographic proximity at the time, and their menus.

Butchie's, owned and operated by Chef Andrea Nicholson, appears to be a simple enough place with seating for around 60 diners and what looks like southern influences on the menu - Country Fried Steak, Hot Nashville Chicken Sandwich, Smoked Pork Shoulder, Hush Puppies, and lots more. It's in Whitby, by the way.

Their Meat+Three concept simply means, choose your protein and then up to three sides ($12, $14, $16). I chose the St. Louis Side Ribs (extra cost) with Hush Puppies and Curry Sweet Potato Soup (the soup of the day).

The soup was delicious, with perfectly balanced flavours, just the right amount of sweetness and curry. The hush puppies, a fried cornmeal dumpling, had a nice texture and the remoulade dip that came with it was outstanding (in my opinion). The ribs were tender but I expected a little more smoke. The seasoning was a little understated but the BBQ sauce that was on the table made it just right.

Chef Andrea was there, doing a little bit of everything - taking orders, cashing, and even serving tables. I love to see business owners interacting with guests! It's such a personal touch. Oh, she said they'll be bottling and selling the remoulade. That's just another reason to come back! I should have taken a selfie with her. One more reason..."}
{"text":"Great casual feel with a fun diner vibe. The menu allows you to select the meat item of your meal with a great selections of sides to choose from. We had a strawberry milk shake, burger, cauliflower cheddar casserole,fries (that was his order). I had the country fried steak with mac and cheese and hush puppies. I have never had country fried steak or hush puppies before and they were great. 

It's fun spot and when the weather is warmer I will come back for some of their Kawartha's ice cream. 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and options for everyone. I've been twice and have been impressed with the chicken wings and sides. Not a fan of the BBQ chicken - it was lathered in sauce but meat was not seasoned. Fall of the bone tender as well but it still didn't hit the mark for me. I'll still be back to try all the options."}
{"text":"The pork shoulder is very good and the fries are soft and fresh. Very filling, wish I had room for pie!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, helpful and friendly staff. Clean, welcoming place.  My only suggestion is that they add a \"sampler\" plate of all the meats, it's super hard to decide between them... had bad food envy whenever a plate went by our table!!!
Will definitely be back to have the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious,  clean and something different to an area that suffers from mediocre food and chains."}
{"text":"Great homestyle local BBQ. We were a group of 4 and got the family pack which comes with 2 meats, 3 sides and 4 drinks. For our meats we got a full rack of ribs and deep fried chicken wings with sides of fries, mac and cheese and hush puppies. Everything came out tasting amazing. Ribs were falling off the bone and the chicken wings were big and crispy. I've heard lots of people say great things about the mac and cheese but for us we didn't really feel it was anything special. However, the French fries and hush puppies were great sides that we would definitely get again."}
{"text":"Favorite burger in the Durham area since Licks stopped grilling their burgers. If you're going to splurge, you can get a side and burger for $12. Amazing cooked all the way through and perfect char on the outside. The fries are twice fried and have really plush potato inside. For an extra $2 you can get another side, which are all delicious. The charred brussel sprouts are exceptional - though seasonal - as is the mac n cheese. Green beans, watermelon salad and cucumber salad are great too, though the cucumber one has a fair bit of dressing. Would also recommend the grilled salmon on days they have it - really good. Everything here is seasoned perfectly. Downsides would be the wait for food, on busy days it can take up to 25 minutes, though they are cooking from fresh ingredients. For two people it can get up to $40, so choose wisely and plan ahead for which weekday you'll eat at Butchie's for the rest of the year."}
{"text":"After driving by this place on numerous occasions ( when it was a diner), finally decided to stop in. I'm glad I did! 

The place itself is clean and open. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. 

The food itself was quite good. We shared the roasted chicken as the portions were big enough. This also came with two sides, we got the ( devil eggs, cabbage). All of it was amazing. 

Look out for the daily specials the buttermilk fried chicken wings are amazing!

It would have been nice if the sides were a bit bigger, as it is on the pricey side.

Other than that, would go again for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place a four because what we would have liked to try (pork shoulder) was sold out.  Came here after following their FB page for months, love love love it here!!!
Need to come back to try the PORK next time...and of course the cake cone was a nice bonus, to celebrate their ONE year anniversary!
Love the service type : order then sit to be served, they have gender-friendly test rooms, there was a nice aroma of yummy food through our patronage, even got to meet one of the owners!
Keep up the great work.  We will be back again sooner than you think!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Awesome good, the milk shakes are a bit over priced, but great. Had their chicken - wow! Husband had their burger - solid, loved it as well. Great fries. Will definitely be back...and with family and friends."}
{"text":"Bad service - just bad.  Went there on a Wednesday night at about 8 pm to get a chocolate milkshake. 

Atleast 5 separate people are waiting to place their or food orders or pay for their ice cream order.  The one lady on til is rude and she's also having to bag take out food so we had to wait about 10 and then asked the lady if we could pay and she had a snotty attitude.  Sure, I was probably being jerky middle aged stressed out Dad, but you've got the chef kinda standing 5 feet away looking around And not busy, the ice cream lady is just standing there.

What a shame."}
{"text":"Butchies is Chef Andrea Nicholson's restaurant. If you don't know who she is, it is perfectly fine as not everyone likes watching all those Top Chef's Canada, Chopped Canada or whatever on Food Network Canada.

I love the concept of Butchies Meat+1+2+3. Sounded simple? But it is a little confusing if you are like me, who are a little indecisive. 

Main: Country Fried Steak sounds interesting? Smoked Pork Shoulder? Hot Nashville Chicken Sandwich (I do like HOT!)? 

Sides: Should I eat healthy? Watermelon Salad sounds refreshing? or Baba's Cucumber Salad? But why am I eating healthy? Should I do 1? 2 or 3?

Trust me the struggle is REAL... 

I got a little lazy and told the girl at the cash what would she suggest for a first-timer? I ended up with Meat+2 ($14)

Butchie's Burger + Mac 'n' Cheese + Green Beans

Wait for the food was a little long as everything is cook when ordered. I watched my green beans being boiled and blanched (a little overcooked and mushy). 

The ingredients were fresh. Burger was A-OK. But personally I found I was interested more in the different sides. 

If you are in Whitby and area, drop by for a visit. I did see Chef Andrea Nicholson walked in and check on the staff after the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Butchies, mainly because of the home style country cooking. Not to mention, the chef is pretty popular around this neck of the woods and pretty much all over. The menu is simple but tasty and unpretentious.

The country fried steak with mac n' cheese and hush puppies is my favourite. The country fried steak is fried to perfection and drizzled on top with deliciously beefy gravy. The mac n' cheese is creamy and addictive. The hush puppies are crunchy and fluffy on the inside.

This place is just plain awesome. To boot, they have these nifty high chairs for babies. I put my little girl in it and she wasn't a big fan.  But the glory of it was that it was family friendly and my little girl's tantrum did not result in the staff or patrons giving any stink eyes."}
{"text":"I had the half smoked chicken and I really enjoyed it.  Kids had burgers and they were okay.  The mac and cheese was amazing.  That should be a stand alone main meal.

Only complaint is the lack of seating.  

Food is really good"}
{"text":"Tried Butchies for the first time today. We ordered the family meal, it was amazing. Very generous portions, and everything we ordered was delicious! Everything was made fresh, with high quality ingredients. There's so much more I could say, but I'm left speechless and satisfied. The owner took our order and told us all about the concept and story of Butchies. She went above and beyond to give us an incredible experience. Everything was very clean and welcoming! 
We finished off with Kawartha ice cream, and sat out on the large outdoor patio. I was all around a fantastic experience. Highly recommend."}
