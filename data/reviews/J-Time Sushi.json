{"text":"I have only been to J-Time once, and I freely admit that the food was delicious.  While I haven't decided if I will be a repeat customer or not, I know more than one J-Time fan who will be.  

Very recently I went to J-Time for my first ever visit.  For the longest time, J-Time was just one of those nameless, faceless sushi places I walked past without ever considering going in.  In fact, the typography on the main sign is stylized to the point of ambiguity, and for a while I wasn't sure if the place was named \"J-Time\", \"I-Time\" or \"Item C\".  It wasn't confirmed for a while, luckily I managed not to embarrass myself by inviting someone to meet me at \"Item C\" in the Annex...

Finally, a few weeks ago, a friend suggested we meet another friend there for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  We got the impression that the place was very understaffed and experienced the associated longer waits for ordering and refills.  I sympathized that there were not enough servers on duty but also felt that a few of our queries about menu items weren't handled very well either.  Again, my friend is a fan of the place and I am sure that with a full staff complement this issue would be avoided.  Also, when we remembered at the last minute we had an additional takeout item to order, the staff brought it out wrapped and ready to go in very short order indeed.

Again, though, the food was quite delicious, everything well prepared and hot items came out hot, etc.  I might even recommend that you order takeout and skip the dining room experience altogether - the decor isn't anything to write home about as it is."}
{"text":"This was the first sushi place I'd ever been to.  Even when I was in Tokyo I didn't go for sushi (I went for pizza hut - and that was pretty good, 4 stars).  Its always an experience trying something new but I do get nervous as a veggie for 22+ years, knowing that in a lot of places they don't really get the not eating something that had parents thing. 

True to form I was first told that the miso soup had no fishy stuff in it... then just as I was about to have a sip I was saved by another attentive server.  Phew.  So eyes wide open I continued the journey - and found a piece of somethings flesh in my sake.

However - I am marking up.  The reason is that every single time I have returned I have noticed that they are continually trying to improve the look of the place.  The service has always been good - you never have to wait long for a top up of tea.  The food is quickly out - its fresh - its hot.. and for me (even though I always give my soup away) for the $7.50 I spend on the veggie bento box I have never left feeling hungry or unsatisfied.  I will admit that I have had better since... but I've paid a lot more for it.

Give it a go... I'm glad that I did (though I still crave pizza hut more... oh the shame)."}
{"text":"Decent neighborhood sushi spot.  The exterior sign looks terrible and is actually why it took me this long to go in, with half a dozen competitors in the vicinity.  However, a friend pushed me in and I was delighted to find two rolls akin to my liking, #57 and #59--awesome no rice options, mostly salmon, cucumber and crab, one with a healthy dose of wasabi.  The wasabi caught me off guard when it hit my tonsil to comic effect.  The sashimi was decent quality too.  The interior is ok, definitely beats the cafeteria feel of some of the nearby sushi options that have bright fluorescent lights."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical of this place when I walked up to this place on a Friday evening and it was nearly empty. I was even more surprised to see such good reviews here.

I ordered a bento box and my food was alright. However, my teriyaki was barely warm and the tempura seemed like it had been sitting around for a while. My dining companion was quite disappointed with the soup he ordered, frequently lamenting his suggestion of trying this place.

All in all, the experience was passable. But in a neighbourhood like The Annex with so many options for sushi, do yourself a favour and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Felt the urge for some Sushi tonight so while I wandered the Annex, I stumbled on J-Time Sushi and it looked the most take-out friendly, so in I went.

Inside was fine, nothing super snazzy or anything but it was fine.

I told them I was just ordering take out, but they still sat me at the front counter, handed me a menu, and poured me a cup of tea while I decided what I wanted. Nice.

I got the Makimono Set (A) combo to go... pretty standard choice, tuna roll, salmon roll, california roll.  They said it would be ready in 5-10 minutes so I left the place to wander BMV across the street for a few mins.

When I came back 10 mins later it was all wrapped up in a bag for me (no 5 cent bag charge here!) and it came with a salad and miso soup.

Overall it was really good, very fresh, nothing mind-blowing but exactly what I hoped/expected it to be.

I will be going back for sure to sample some of their other offerings now that I know that the basics are done right there."}
{"text":"Went to Toronto in March. We were in the Annex and wanted some sushi for lunch.  We stopped in and they had a special that included 2 Items + miso soup+ Salad for 6.99. Additional rolls/items were 3 bucks more.  The sushi was very tasty, the salmon and tuna tasted \"Fresh\" to me.  This is not Nobu, but for 10 bucks what the hell do you expect.  I have had worse sushi in Toronto.  The service was efficient and attentive.  My water glass stayed full. I definitely recommended this place if you want inexpensive sushi."}
{"text":"J-Time was the first place I ever went for sushi in Toronto and it still remains one of the better places I have been to. It's on the north side of Bloor, which seems to be the side of the street with the lesser-known sushi establishments.

Firstly, someone mentioned that the decor is nothing to write home about. This is a false statement because everyone I know who has been to J-Time loves the decor. It is simply geometric shapes cut out of neon construction paper but it looks great! Sushi places aren't particularly known for being kitsch but this was a nice attempt at it.

Secondly, J-Time named its maki rolls after Toronto. This scores HUGE points with me. Why not chow down on the CN Tower, SkyDome, and hockey rolls for the night?

As I don't eat anything but salmon and tuna, my options aren't endless but J-Time accommodates my diet. What I do recommend is their vegetarian pizza. Sushi pizza is a rice patty covered in tempura flakes, then fried, topped with a choice of fresh fish, and is mind-blowingly delicious as it combines cool and hot sensations in your mouth. The veggie one is the way to go because they top it with huge slices of avocado and it is no secret that avocado is a pricey ingredient. (And it's better than New Gen's veggie version, if I say so myself.)

If you going during certain hours, you do get the typical soup and salad dance, which is always nice.

Take out is also a good option but you can be in and out of the restaurant fairly quickly."}
