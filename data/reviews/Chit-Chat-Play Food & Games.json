{"text":"Scarborough's take on Snakes and Lattes. Great atmosphere, pay by the hour to be here. Teas are not bad at all either. Tons of board/card games. Bubble tea was not bad either!"}
{"text":"We have been there twice so far. The first time we went, we had a good experience.  We went with a party of 3 people. There was one staff in particular that would often come over and explain new games and had good customer service skills. We ordered bubble teas which came fast and also got a gelato which was really good. We got there around 7 pm and it was fairly quiet. So I feel that the staff were able to spend the time with us. Further into the evening, it got really busy, so it was harder to ask for suggestions. Some staff weren't able to teach us the games properly as they didn't seem to know how to play. Overall first time experience was good. The second time we went, we went with a party of 6 around 7 pm. Once again, it wasn't as busy at first so the staff suggested a few games. I feel that it would help if the staff could explain the games a bit better. We ended up reading up how to play it ourselves or just YouTubed it. As the evening progressed, it got busy. At that point when we asked if a new game could be suggested, they said they were too busy and wouldn't be able to help. We ordered a few bubble teas and waffles and they were good. My experience the second time around was not as great as the first time."}
{"text":"This is a great place to spend time with friends and relax. I've been to CCP several times and the owner and staff are always so helpful and willing to teach the different games available. Absolutely amazing service. The drinks were delicious and great to enjoy with games. I've also bought several games from them, very convenient after discovering a new game."}
{"text":"Had an AMAZING experience here.  As you soon as you walk in you are greeted with friendly staff who are eager to recommend and teach you how to play fun board games.   The food here is also delicious -- they have bubble tea and different kinds of dessert pancakes and waffles.  Too bad I don't live in Toronto because I would definitely come here more often!"}
{"text":"10% off Yelp Checkin. They don't handle cash, so all payment must be done via debit, and credit.  Ample amount of games to choose from. Great thing is most are in great condition. I'm glad people are still great in respecting properties.  Staff are super friendly, and always around for help. They are super chill, and always comes to check on how we were doing. Lots of hot water refill for our tea."}
{"text":"Fun place to go to play some board games. They have all the basic games (monopoly, Jenga, cards against humanity) with other variety. The workers know how to play all the games so you can count on them if you don't know. They were all super nice and friendly. There's a fee to play games for either one hour or the whole night.   The food here isn't the best. I got a bubble tea and the tapioca tasted like rocks. My friend got a white hot chocolate that tasted like water. The desserts were basic with ice cream and waffles."}
{"text":"Great bubble tea, came here to study with a friend and we both ordered drinks that came fairly fast and it was super good, I ordered a hazelnut boba but they didn't have it so I just ordered honey boba but they heard honeydew and gave me honeydew, but I'm not complaining it still tasted good, and she ordered a mocha latte, we drank, and played games for 3 hours, it was super good, we were looking for anything else to order but they only have a small selection of items on the menu. The only thing bad about it is that they only accept debit, we are highschool children with no jobs, how are we supposed to come to a cute cafe with the small amount of cash we have to be expected to bring a debit card, hope theyll start accepting cash soon, then I'll come back."}
{"text":"Cute concept they need to explore and expand their menu, we orderd Latte and Americano  not that spectacular. Waffle is cold Lots of options for games  You pay to play  $4 each person for 1 hour"}
{"text":"Good gelato, unique drink selections, huge boardgame selection and boardgames for sale too! The space is really nice to play in too. Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in east Scarborough! I've visited this location a few times the last few months and I've had a really great time for the most part. They have really fun decor and lots of space. Tons of board games, literally hundreds of games to choose from. They even have a good amount of 2 player games, however I suggest going with a group of 4 to enjoy the wide selection.  The menu is pretty basic, definitely not a spot to go for dinner... desserts and coffee, yes. The cakes are mostly La Rocca. Waffles and crepes seem to be made fresh to order and the variety they have are pretty tasty!  Coffees, bubble tea and other drinks are made by the staff as well. I haven't ever been too impressed with the bubble tea. Definitely not comparable to something you'd get from a traditional tea shop (Midland/Finch, Pacific Mall...) one time the bubbles were over cooked and mushy, next time our bubble teas were watery and flavourless even after requesting them to remake it.  The only thing I will openly express a total disappointment about was THE WASHROOM. The last time I visited the washroom was filthy. Dusty in all corners, dirty toilet, crusty sink and counter top, really dirty light switch... just disgusting. The night I last visited there were 2 employees, and it was not a busy night. However, instead of cleaning the horrible bathroom, they sat at a table on their laptops chatting about their personal lives. Really need to step it up with the cleanliness of the bathroom. Especially since there is only one bathroom for everyone, it better be in good condition. Needs to be cleaned AT LEAST twice a day. Grab some gloves, a bottle of Lysol spray, a roll of paper towel and take 5 minutes to take care of it. Come on guys.  Despite this, I'd still return and recommend others to visit as well. But please. Clean. The. Bathroom."}
{"text":"I have visited Chit Chat Play on multiple occasions.   The location in Markham was a hidden gem. It was small, but very quaint and open early at 3:00PM on weekdays and 2:00PM on weekends. At this location, they served hot and cold beverages, soda, gelato and waffles.   Only 1 person would manage the caf√©, but I found the staff here to be very friendly and helpful.  I have met the Owner on two occasions as he worked here also. He is definitely passionate about what he does. He is the epitome of a true game guru and a people person. He spends his free time learning all of the games and is very knowledgeable. He was great at recommending games based on genre preference and group size. I noticed that every time I grabbed a new game off the shelf, he walked over to help us set-up, explained the game rules in great detail from start to end, and showed us how to play. He went above and beyond to surpass my expectations of amazing customer service!   With the opportunity to try out so many different games, I found myself purchasing a new game from the cafe every time I went. I fell in love with this place.   This was a perfect place for a date night as they had a large selection of two player games. I've lost track of time before and often found myself playing for 4 hours.   I decided to celebrate my birthday here last year. We came with a group of 8 people--4 who had never been to a game cafe before and 3 who did not think they would enjoy the experience. Funny enough, even the people who were hesitant did not want to leave. We all had such an AMAZING time.   After having so much fun the last time, my sister decided to celebrate her birthday this year at Chit Chat.  As the Markham location has been shut down, we went to the one in Scarborough. I have been twice to this location.  It opens later at 6:00PM on weekdays and 2:00PM on weekends.  It is a much larger space and there are 3 employees. The atmosphere is very nice and the decor is lovely. The scrabble wall is picture worthy!   The new location has expanded their menus to included bubble tea and La Rocca cake.  The bubble tea is good, but their pistachio and hazelnut gelato definitely steal the show! It is a must try if you go.   Unfortunately, my experience at this location did not live up to par. I was extremely disappointed and disheartened.  Pieces were missing from the most of the games we tried to play. See list below: - Telestrations had markers that did not work - Pictionary did not have any paper - Family Feud was missing the instructions and a marker - Blokus Trigon was missing pieces - Operations playing pieces were found in games that did not belong  The staff mainly stayed behind the counter and were focused on drink/dessert orders.  These employees were fine as servers, but rarely knew how to play any of the games including the staff and player favorites recommended on their own chalkboard wall.  Instead of asking the staff to teach us games we wanted to learn, we asked them to teach us a game they knew instead.  An employee came over to our table with a game, told us the objective, and rushed through the rules in under 3 minutes. She was not very good at explaining as we were often left reading the instruction manual on our own. This happened a few times. We eventually got fed up wasting time trying to figure out how to play, we gave up and switched to games we knew how to play instead.  On another occasion, I later asked the same employee if she could recommend another game. She had the audacity to say she was too busy, to go look for a party game on the shelf and to teach myself how to play.   Considering it being my sister's birthday and having a large group of people, I was not pleased.  With that kind of service and attitude, we left shortly after.  This new location might be larger and have more dessert options, but I feel what once made it special as a game caf√© is no longer there.  If you're looking to expand your game collection or learn from a game guru, this isn't the place anymore. I'm really sad to see it like this now."}
{"text":"Lots of games to choose from and liked that it wasn't too busy.  Wished the people who worked there, knew the games better to make suggestions or to teach us how to play.   Drinks aren't that good.  Interesting options like purple yam, but it tasted like water and the turmeric latte had toooo much turmeric, didn't taste the coconut.   The pistachio gelato was ok, tasted more like green tea.  The washroom is very gross, dirty and very dusty...."}
{"text":"This is a really convenient place for anyone who goes to either of the centennial's or the u of t campus, it has a great selection of games and is set up like a cafe, with gelato cakes and drinks available. Im not sure if they're planning on expanding but it would be great if they offered finger foods in the future. I've had fun the times I have visited and so have the people I've been with. Really friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I never post reviews but I had to after this experience. I was so excited to try this place because it's close to home, cute and has bubble tea! However, I walked out with a bad taste in my mouth. To start off, they didn't bother to help us figure out a game to play or even ask if we'd like help. Regardless, we struggled on to try a new game. One time we asked to be explained the rules, and the employee who was helping us rushed through the rules as he had the other two employees annoying him (and us) by calling his name, saying \"there's an emergency so come quickly\" and joking around. Mind you, these two employees were at a separate table (along with the one who got up to help us) playing their own game. Is this normal for this chain? I'm not sure but I won't be going again to find out, because this is Toronto and there's just better Friday night options where customer service is of importance and employees don't play and act this immature on their job. It isn't enjoyable if you prefer good service and common courtesy. 2 stars for the cute venue and wide array of games available."}
{"text":"Nice interior design, and so so so many games to choose from.  Lots of seating. Teas, lattes, fruit smoothies, gelatos  waffle, Crepes, and La Rocca cakes are on the menu. There is no actual food here vis a vis sandwiches or fries or something.  I'm disappointed to know that they charge $8 per person to play the board games. It should kind of just come with the atmosphere. I think if you order something to drink it should be free. In other words, it would be reasonable to charge people who DON'T order drinks or desserts.  If you want to come hang out and do something different with friends and family, this is a good place.  PS, they don't take cash. Credit and debit only.  Kind of ridiculous but I guess that's how it is. Never heard of that before."}
{"text":"This place is definitely up and coming ! As a person that lives in the Durham region it is so hard to find fun and cool places to hangout with your friends. We love board game cafes but travelling all the way downtown for a place like snakes and lattes is a bit of doozy - and it is no fun when the place is jam packed and its hard to find yourself a table.  I am happy to say I will no longer be travelling downtown because of Chit-Chat! All of the staff members are very friendly and it has a stylish and spacious design. They have lights for each table so you can see all your pieces/cards - this was very helpful because I remember being at snakes and we were seated at a table without a light which was a bit annoying - and also tables that expand which is very helpful when you are playing board games with a large set up (e.g Mysterium). It is obvious that they thought of everything here.  The place is still going about their soft opening. They have great desserts but I was kind of hoping for other cafe items like a sandwich or bagel perhaps. They do have a game guru which is absolutely helpful because I hate reading instructions. He is so nice and always has a game ready for you to play next. It is a bit tough if the game guru steps out and you're kind of lost but thats okay. There were one or two games I was looking for that they did not have however they do have many other games to choose from which is not a problem!   Overall I think this place will become a hot spot in no time. I kind of wish this place would remain a little secret amongs my friends and I but I already know that it won't last that long!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this new place! The interior is designed and decorated beautifully, there is a huge selection of board games and I love that the place is bright so that it is easier to see, compared to the other board game cafes I've been to.  The staff is super friendly, the game-master would suggest fun games that he thinks we would enjoy as soon as we're almost done the current game that we are playing! LIKE how nice and considerate!  They do not have a lot of options in terms of food right now, because it is just the soft opening, but right now they have gelato and cake with some drinks.  I cannot wait for the official opening. This will definitely be my new go-to place for games!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last week with my son and two different groups of friends. After both visits the things that have stuck out: Pros - the people that work here are so Nice! And while they don't know all of the games (there's too many for this to be feasable) they are happy to help out  - the variety of games is great! Varying levels of difficulty and complexity make it easy to find something for everyone  - it is very clean!   Cons  - on both occasions I was there they were out of many menu items  - there is no real food here so it's difficult to come on a weeknight, you have to either come right after school and leave for dinner or wait until after dinner and then it's too late. Some real food choices would go a long way  - the drinks... I love a fancy drink, but for kids it's not ideal. Some pop/juice options would be helpful  All in all I really like this place but unless they add some menu items my family won't be able to come on weeknights."}
{"text":"Just came here To play board games.  They have over 100 board games to choose from plus they have desserts and lattes to drink from.  The staff is super friendly and thee place is clean.  My sister enjoyed their pistachio gelato.  They make their own gelato.  Great place to spend time with your family especially if you're competitive in playing board games."}
