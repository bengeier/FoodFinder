{"text":"Lately I've been watching alot of Bobby Flay on the Food Network who uses a wide array of Mexican ingredients, which aren't commonly found in Canadian supermarkets. Fortunately, I found Salsita, a quaint little Mexican Market in the northwest. This store is decked out in brightly coloured walls and Mexican themed decorations, which made me feel like I was in Mazatlan. They carry a wide range of authentic Mexican canned goods and spices like whole dried ancho chilies and Mexican cinnamon sticks. If you're not a home chef, Salsita offers a wide selection of already prepared frozen foods. Taquitos. Burritos. Enchiladas. Empanadas. Ole!  They're selection of homemade salsas and guacamoles was impressive, they have pre-made ceviche, and they carry a few Mexican cheeses like Queso Fresco, a crumbly goat cheese.  If you need a little guidance with using these ingredients, Salsita offers cooking classes for various regional dishes and styles of cooking for $55/person."}
{"text":"Not the cheapest place to buy staples like masa for tortillas, but a good place for foodies to pick up more specialty ingredients such as masa for tamales, epazote (a traditional herb that goes in beans, also has anti-flatulence properties) and huitlacoche (a fungus that grows on corn).  Also, they have a wide variety of prepared foods for the less adventurous: I have also heard good things about the ceviche from friends. The ladies who runs the place is very nice, and I was very happy with the customer service: I bought a tortilla press, which broke the first time I used it.  When I returned to the store, she let me have another brand of press (much sturdier) for only the items' price difference of a few dollars."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Salsita when I was at a neighboring business, I love Latin food, so I thought I would check it out.  They have some produce, like key limes and chilies, along with shelves of canned and dried food.  They carry an assortment of Mexican candies.  They had a great selection of dried chilies.  There was freshly made salsa and shrimp ceviche, which I had to try, a small container of the ceviche cost $5.  They also have mole sauce, guacamole and cheese, most \"deli\" items cost around $10 for a medium, $5 for small.  It seemed that they offer lunch here, but there was only black bean soup on the chalk board.  I asked the woman working if the ceviche was made that day and she said yes.  The interac wasn't working, fortunately I had some cash to pay for my ceviche.  They even offer cooking classes here for $55 per person!  My ceviche turned out to be very good.  I recommend checking out Salsita if you are a lover of Latin foods!"}
{"text":"Oh how cute is this place! I've been waiting for a day where I could stop by and take a few moments to walk around this shop. I came to buy fresh corn tortillas because it's time for me to make another batch of tortilla chips at home. They carry a few different brands, including locally made Las Tortillas, and the prices are reasonable.   The one thing that stood out is how well they get that Mexican/Latin food is extremely friendly to those with wheat and gluten intolerances...and there are little signs near the coolers in plain sight telling people which foods are gluten-free. This is something I clued into a long time ago, however, to those new to this lifestyle it is good to have it so clearly marked. Extra kudos to Salsita for including this their displays!"}
{"text":"I was cookin' up a fierce Mexican dinner and needed some authentic ingredients. I headed over to Salsita.   Salsita carries everything from homemade salsa to canned products.   There aren't a lot of authentic Mexican stores in our city, so I'm ouber grateful that this place is around.   The service is good and the pricing is decent.   Try their guacamole....MMM delish!"}
{"text":"Amazing grocery store. They make their own tortilla chips. The homemade food here is delicious. A must try!"}
{"text":"Our whole purpose of going out this Sunday was to check out this Latin Market on Northmount Dr NW. What a great stop it was! This store is primarily Mexican, the decor was cool and if you need a tortilla press or pinata this place is for you! The owner is SO nice and if you are nice to her, maybe you will get a complimentary taste of her guacamole! They are set up to have lunch daily, Saturdays being very busy we were told. There are a few seats at the window inside or you can take your food to go. They cook in the back and the owner advised that she used only the freshest of ingredients. You will not find fresh plantains for sale as she does not want little fruit flies in her shop. Good call but we were actually looking to buy plantains. Some Venezuelan products were found prepped in the fridge (Arepas and Tequenos) as well as Chilean Empanadas. You take them home and just fry them/bake them.  It is not the biggest Latin market I have seen in Calgary but there are a few shelves lined with jars and cans, tortilla chips, sodas, rice. Prices were on par with the rest of Calgary, lots of imported goodies! We did buy a bag full of stuff including Mexican Oregano which is supposed to be the bomb and once you use it you will never go back to anything else comparable! One wall had a nice assortment of dried chiles and other cool spices, right up my alley. The shop was clean and appeared to be very well organized. The owner was interesting and seemed to know her stuff as a self professed foodie.  We will be back as often as we can!"}
{"text":"I checked in here today but the Yelp App on my BB gives me grief constantly...just can't win with it :).  I've been here a few times and enjoy the nice variety of latin/mexican foods.  Always pick up something made in house to take home and taste plus I love to wander around checking out all the items and always finding something new that is inspiring.  Today I noticed they have Queso Fresco & Manchego Cheese....2 cheeses I've wanted to try for awhile.  Since I was buying enough today I decided to hold off on the cheese until my next visit.  The lady working there was super nice.  Love supporting local businesses like this and maybe one day I will get to try one of their cooking classes!"}
{"text":"I came here for specific dried chiles as I was making a chili.  I also needed a small amount of masa.  And the personable and professional owner of the store happily gave me 3 tbsp.    Not only do they have a wonderful selection of chiles, they also offer frozen homemade Mexican delights.   I plan on going back for sure for some tamales.   Friendly and awesome.  If I'm going to travel 20 minutes across the city for specific Mexican ingredients, I'll be going to Salsitas.  Update:  I didn't mention that I bought homemade tortilla chips. I'm finally eating them now. Oh my goodness!  They are AMAZING!   I'm not sure I'll ever go back to \"Tostitos\" again after having these!"}
{"text":"The business has changed its name to Salsita.  I don't know when, but I think it's recent.  Clearly I like the new name because it actually lured me in.  I browsed the small store for about 10 min before deciding what to purchase.  They have an impressive variety of canned and dry goods as well as tortillas, salsas and ready-made food.  I wanted to purchase several items to sample and was most drawn to the mango salsa, but the prices are just too high for me.  The only thing I walked away with was 6 beef Empanadas, which were decent.  I would have preferred more spice but they might have them in a spicier version and I could have missed it.    I'd say it's worth your time to drop by.  They do serve coffee as well and have some fun party accessories on hand.  April Challenge: The Underdog  1/30"}
{"text":"Finally went in to check things out. For a guy who loves Mexican food, everything looked great. That was until I looked at the prices. Wow!!!!!!  Who knew a simple cuisine like Mexican could be so expensive, only in Calgary.  I will stick to making my own Mexican at a fraction of the price. Too bad, this place had promise."}
