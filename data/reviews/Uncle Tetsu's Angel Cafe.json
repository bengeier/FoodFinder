{"text":"Had noodles with bonito flakes, pickled radish and mayo. Great dish. There was a surprise concert too. I think the portions are too small for the price, so it gets 3 etoiles."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I ordered the original cheesecake to go, so I didn't see much of the place. The cake was very, very soft, tasted really good, and melted in my mouth (like they advertise). I would come back again and recommend to a friend. 

I went back to another one of their locations in a couple days (went to Niagara first) and ordered more cheesecake.

EDIT: I think I bumped the overall rating to 4 when I posted this!"}
{"text":"This just the cafe not that famous one. The cheese is not that rich, the cake...not bad. Lot of waitresses with \"cute\" small and voice."}
{"text":"I can't believe that if you want to buy a whole cheesecake you can only take it to go. If you want to eat in the cafe you can only buy slices, and of course pay tip. I got their matcha latte; overpriced and just okay. I also got their original cheesecake and.... It was SO disappointing. It was kind of bland actually, didn't have much of a cheese flavor or sweet taste, and kind of dry towards the bottom. I've had Japanese cheese cake in Toronto much much better than this, like ten-fold, but I won't mention the place here. Sorry uncle Tetsu, but you have been a disappointment. I just expected better."}
{"text":"I love to come here because the food is good and I am a sucker for anything cute and pink!. It can be a little pricey but every experience I have had here has been good so I don't mind and they have specials on specific days as well as a stamp card so there are ways to save money!.
 
The food is super cute the last time I went with my friend we ordered a matcha latte, Sundae swirl, Matcha Pudding, omurice (they draw on it for you too!), and a vanilla bean latte. It was good I loved it all I especially love matcha so of course, almost everything we ordered was matcha. 
In conclusion, if you love cute things, and sweet foods you will like this place and even if you don't have a sweet tooth there are some savory foods you can have instead!."}
{"text":"Delicious! We stumbled upon this place and it was a fabulous surprise. We are not a fan of super sweet desserts so this place was heaven for us. We had the strawberry cheesecake, tiramisu, and hot chocolate. It was our first time having Japanese style cheesecake and we were pleasantly surprised by the lightness of it. The hot chocolate was so full of flavor and it was truly like drinking chocolate. For those who prefer a milky, sweet hot chocolate, they might find it to be somewhat bitter. 

We got to the café a bit late in the evening after 9:00pm and could no longer order the dessert platter that had small portions of the various cakes and desserts. Next time, I would definitely get there earlier and try that sampler plate. The café is a great place for a date or hanging out with girlfriends. There is even a stage where people can take photos in the costumes the servers wear."}
{"text":"I love Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake, so I had to try this place when I heard about it.  I went with some friends after work on a Wednesday; we wanted to try something different.  The maid costumes are super cute and the servers were all very friendly and quick with the food.  We weren't sure if the maid theme would seem a bit weird, not having been to a maid cafe before, but it was fun and cute.  We all got parfaits and various drinks; everything was delicious.  The parfait is huge - none of us could manage to finish it.  It starts with matcha pudding on the bottom, then corn flakes, whipped cream, matcha cheesecake, and finally matcha ice cream topped off with a cookie :)  They didn't have a show the evening that we went, unfortunately, but we'll try again another day.  Lot's of people were taking photos of themselves with the maids on the stage/photo platform area, and the cafe had a nice vibe.  It's a good place to hang out with some friends and eat some cake.  We stayed and chatted for two hours or so and the staff never tried to hurry us out.  I will definitely be going back (particularly since my favourite place for matcha in the area, Tsujiri, has very little seating.)"}
{"text":"Great presentations on their trays and lattes. The waitresses weren't too bad to look at either with those French maid outfits I've been telling everyone at least to try it once!!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Nice Christmas tree.  
Crepe and cheese cake was good

Will come back again"}
{"text":"Cuteness overload!  A westernized version of the Japanese Maid cafe (minus the quirkiness)!  Their waitresses called 'angels' are dressed in maid costumes but don't expect them to cosplay as servants!  You'll be greeted by one at the entrance, directing patrons to their cafe or takeout counter upstairs.

I got a large strawberry angel hat cake to go, so can't comment on the service and wait times.  The cafe looks cozy and spacious though. 

Angel hats are baked cheesecakes in a dome shape. The small ones go for $10 while large ones are $18 each.  The cashier said the large will serve 5-6.  I personally think it's good for up to 8.  Tastes like typical Glico Pocky or Lotte's strawberry flavor but a touch less intense. Light, fluffy and not too sweet, a bit more moist than their Jap cheesecake versions. 3 flavors available today: original, chocolate and strawberry. 

Lunar cheesecakes are uncooked. $18 each.  Comes in original, matcha and chocolate flavors.  Will definitely return to try these and their pudding too!"}
{"text":"I dropped by Friday evening with my friend, it wasn't very busy surprisingly. I've had their cheesecake before and really enjoyed it so I was excited to see their maid cafe. Especially since my friend was raving about it, from her previous visit. 

The ambience was very cozy and sweet and it was nice to see both cute maids and waiters. We ordered the angel hat cake in strawberry and matcha latte and the original cheesecake and vanilla latte. The order came out quickly and the servers were very friendly. 

It was about $30 for the both of us which was alright. Hopefully next time we go, we will be able to catch a performance by them!"}
{"text":"I have been to Japan and this brings back memories.Yes theme central restaurants are typical in Japan.I know watching Japanese girls in maid costumes can be eye candy.But the delicious desserts are terrific.Go for the platter,that allows you to share with friends and get a taste of everything"}
{"text":"These Japanese fluffy cheesecake were super hot in Hong Kong 10 years ago and finally it's arrived in Toronto and now with a cafe! 

Tried the original a few times - fresh & hot & also had it chilled ~~ the strawberry angel hat was so so~~ still fluffy but not much of strawberry flavour 

Lovely environment but NOT BABY FRIENDLY if u have a stroller and need to carry the stroller, baby & diaper bag~~~Don't like how u still have to go upstairs for take out orders when they have a street level bakery~"}
{"text":"Food: 
I ordered matcha cheesecake, matcha ice cream, matcha latte, and the platter (omelette, salad, ketchup rice, and daily soup). They were pretty standard but the cheesecake was best. Menu is small. Don't come here expecting super food other than the cheesecake I guess.

Environment:
Their AC is broken and it was so hot. 2 customers left because of that. I didn't mind it as much but I just felt bad for the maids in heavy costumes. They have to dance too! 

Service:
The main attraction! They're very cute and friendly. My maid was really artistic and drew a really nice moogle on my omelette. I loved talking to them. They're great dancers too.

So overall I'd come back for the cake and the maids. Pretty neat place"}
{"text":"Dream check 
Always dream to see a maid cafe in Canada and uncle tetsu made it real , big thumbs up 
The business model is sustainable because it is adapt to western culture and the popularity of the famous cheesecake makes it viable to run the maid cafe on the side. 
Don't expect the same experience as a real maid cafe in Japan. The waitress are dress as maid (+talk cute) and that's much about it. And it's a really good start. 
Dancing and singing Performance on weekend 
We ordered parfait, cheesecake, pudding, matcha latte 
Omg cure bear food art , I'm dying , so kawaii
Maid kawaii 
Love it 
Definitely coming back , so relaxing"}
{"text":"Came here after Ramen and I did not expect the employee dressed up. We only wanted to try the cheese cake and see what the rave was about. $10 for the original cheese cake and they have other flavours as well, but for now just the original.

The design of the cake is cute with the character stamped on the cheese cake. When i cut into the cheesecake, it was super soft like I was cutting through a cloud. When i taste it, it was soft and not as dense as i imagine it to be. Flavour wise it did not have much cheese cake flavour, if you know what i mean. Just feels like i am eating 'foam' with a lot of calories. Overall, i think i am comparing it too much with western cheese cake (bold flavour) but I think i would try a green tea one if they have."}
{"text":"Drinks were tasty (had the matcha latte)!  We also ordered croquettes, they were ok, nothing special just very plain tiny little croquettes. But not sure what I was expecting as this is a dessert place.

The cheesecake was delicious of course, the strawberry angel hat was my favourite. My friend also got a strawberry waffle-type thing with ice cream and whip cream, which was also tasty!

I will definitely come back here again for dessert, good and friendly servers, and very cute and unique atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Cute maids & delicious desserts! :) I definitely recommend the cheesecake, the parfait and the omurice dish! The maids were very polite and accommodating. Thank you for the great service! :) 10/10 would visit again! :D"}
{"text":"Dropped by with the best friend and was not disappointed. We were greeted by these really cute servers, dressed in maid outfits. I haven't been to Japan, but for a bit, I felt like I was in a Japan cafe, somewhat of a whole new world. She greeted us and sat us down. She let us know immediately that there was a minimum spend per person. I would usually be turned off by this but the cafe is new and I understand that you wouldn't want to seat a bunch of people and they order one piece of cheesecake and water. Totally understand. Their menus came in newspaper form. Super cute! 

We order the dessert platter, which came with a little bit of everything. It was $24.50 and it was a perfect way to taste almost everything they had to offer. We got matcha tea and matcha latte as well! 

The presentation of the food was remarkable. Super Instagram worthy. As far as I remember, I enjoyed everything on the platter! Especially the matcha cheesecake... my fav! My best friend's favourite was the matcha ice cream.

Overall the experience was great. However, it was pricey. I will probably be back with friends or family from out of town, to give them this experience. The waitresses were cute and always there to refill your water. 

Thanks for such a great time :)
 
Happy Belly!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and I love the entire idea of it. They have a variety of things on their menu and all the workers are extremely nice. It's a wonderful place for anime fans because they play a lot of anime openings here. Literally love this place!"}
{"text":"Upstairs was really hot. AC not working. I was sweating the whole time. Cheesecake was good. But matcha ice cream was disappointing."}
{"text":"Interesting place. I just went for dessert so my review is based on that. Split the angel hat cheesecake (original) and matcha pudding. The angel hat cheesecake was good, but the pudding was just okay. Service was prompt and quick."}
{"text":"My 3rd time giving the Uncle Tetsu franchise a try. Came here on a Saturday, not too busy, short wait. Mostly tourists. Not wheel-chair accessible. Overpriced. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Paid exactly $10 for a Matcha Hat Cake. Maybe it's the texture, but for some reason, I still can't get myself to like them. Denser than the original cheesecakes, but personally still not a consistency that my taste buds like...too soft and eggy.

What made me angry was that they noted it was 'takeout'. However, my friend and I were visibly exhausted from walking in the rain and just wanted to sit down for a few minutes at a table. We were immediately rushed to GTFO ASAP. I asked if my one friend and I could just \"like, sit down for only 5 minutes and eat this?\" This was her reply in verbatim: \"Unfortunately not, we have a very strict policy against takeout food\". Excuse me?? I just bought this hat cake at YOUR store!! Are you kidding me? It wasn't even busy! No accommodations made. When I politely mentioned that there were tons of empty seats, we only sat for a minute until she rushed us out - how rude! Just spent $10 to be rushed out, fantastic customer service...No forks, spoons, napkins or anything. What a joke!

Too bad, everything about this entire franchise is seriously overpriced and overhyped. I really wanted to like the Uncle Tetsu brand; I gave it a few chances. But give it a year or two, this place is gonna be dead.

Not coming back here EVER."}
{"text":"Durant un weekend à Toronto je suis allée au Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Angel Cafe avec mon conjoint, suite à une recommandation d'un ami Torontois. Mon conjoint et moi sommes tous les deux déjà allés au Japon et c'était une des premières fois depuis notre retour que nous allions dans un restaurant qui sert des desserts typiquement japonais.

Nous avons pris l'assiette de dégustation, quand même assez onéreuse, avec différentes sortes de gâteaux. Les gâteaux étaient très bons et moelleux à souhait. 

Par contre, notre ami ne nous avait pas averti que c'était un \"maid cafe\". C'est à dire que les serveuses sont de jeunes femmes habillées en fillettes et qui nous parlent avec une voix faussement aiguë et une attitude modeste. De quoi nous rendre légèrement mal à l'aise (ah, \"Uncle\" Tetsu, eh?).

Bref, les gâteaux sont bons, mais chers. Le service est de qualité, mais le concept machiste n'aurait pas dû être importé."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first time here. The setting is cute and lively, the service is very friendly, and the desserts and tea are great. 

My friends and I have all tried the original Uncle Tetsu cheesecake before, so we tried their other offerings. The chocolate lunar cheesecake ($5.95) is denser and richer than the original cheesecake and angel hat. It's a great choice for a chocolate lover. The chocolate angel hat ($5.95) is light and not as flavourful, so I'm not sure I'd order that again. I had the strawberry angel hat (also $5.95), which I really enjoyed. It was fluffy and subtle, and in the strawberry flavour I appreciated the subtlety.

I tried the genmaicha (roasted rice tea, $3.75) and it was robust but quickly lost its flavour. I, however, loved the houjicha tea ($3.75), which had deep and toasty flavours that perfectly complemented the desserts.

I'm looking forward to trying the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Honestly, when this place first started up it was great. I really enjoyed the service and love the personalities of the maid. We went there once a week for a month before we got too busy to go back.

Recently we (my boyfriend and I) went and were greeted by the most horrific service we ever had. It seemed we had gotten the worse maid of them all. 

She didn't have an uplifting personality. She was downtrodden and barely gave us a smile. Her tone made it sound like she didn't even want to be there and didn't want to serve us either. She hardly looked at anyone when she was serving, and looked to be avoiding glances. 

We had to shout for her attention the one time to ask for the cheque at the end. Over ten minutes passed before we decided to ask someone else for it. We don't regret the 5 percent tip either.

I hope they do something to remedy this. This wasn't the amazing experience I had when I first visited. And I don't want them to close because of one person. I definitely won't go back there any time soon. Hopefully when I do it'll be much better."}
{"text":"Had a great time with my friends at the newly opened angel Cafe. It's a pink sign in the front so it's hard to miss it! We were greeted instantly by the host. Once you get seated him and all the waitresses yell \"welcome\" at you in Japanese. The menu is short and sweet they only serve dessert and drinks. For desserts they have puddings or original cheesecake, matcha cheesecake, and different flavours of angel hats.  For drinks they have teas lattes etc. My friend ordered the tropical green tea and it was around 3.75$ came in a large teapot.  We shared a few desserts - original cheesecakes and angel hats - the cakes are slices of the cake and they are $4.8 so it is a better deal to get the whole cake for $10 but you do not get to dine in and talk with the maids.  
It was super cool seeing all the maids. We got a few pics with them. They also do a dance on certain days - we were there on a Saturday so no dance that day. But Sunday they do a dance on the stage.  
The Angel hat was the best. I ended up getting an Angel hat (10$ ) to go.  I managed to get the last one, they were sold out by around 8pm.  
It as also my friends birthday so they ended up surprising her and all of us with a song with all the maids! That made my day lol. And they also write happy birthday on the plate. 
The environment is welcoming and we did stay for a bit to chat. 

Also the washrooms are interesting. It's co Ed but once u get in they have maybe 8 different stalls that have a sink inside too. 

I would definitely come back. Angel hats are the best!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly it was not busy when my group went to the Angel Cafe. There were three of us and we decided to order the dessert platter for $24.50. Split that three ways and it's very reasonable. The platter comes with everything on the menu with the exception of the parfait from what I recall.  It had a simple presentation and was complemented with 3 sauces (chocolate, strawberry and matcha). All three of us enjoyed the variety and the quality."}
{"text":"Came here after dinner one evening celebrating an anniversary & birthday. 

It so happened that they have a 1-hour show performing that evening. It was packed with people (men). 
 
The cafe is nice, food was mediocre. The show was good, very positive, very happy. Everyone there seem to enjoyed and had a good time singing and dancing along. 

They are quite pricey, and the show was $10 per person (I had no idea until I got the bill). They also charge for birthday dessert (dessert price) and birthday plating ($5). 

**No specials, no discount. And maybe they had too many people that evening with 2 birthdays (one was ours another at the table next to us) so they got the dessert mixed up and my dear boyfriend stood there looking at his dessert and sparklers burnt out before the dessert even got to our table.  =( 

Most of the staffs were Japanese, decent English, willingly to take pictures with you BUT do not ask them for personal information!

I guess it is a one time thing for me, good attraction but I'd rather go to maid cafe in Japan generally nicer atmosphere and I can hear Japanese and receive Japanese services."}
{"text":"If you are looking for amazing light cheescake and cute smiley waitresses that will warm the heart of even the most cynical people such as myself then this is the place to go. 

I quite like the cheesecake at the original (for Toronto) Uncle Tetsu's but the Angel hat cake is even lighter and for me better, and even better for having a range of flavours.

I hope the line-ups aren't too long when they open properly, I'd quite like to try the full range of cakes on offer."}
{"text":"Great parfaits that have their cake inside, surprisingly more filling then I though. Have not had any of their food but it looks good."}
{"text":"Going to the Dundas location and ordering the full cheesecake is much more worth it than coming here. Ordering a slice of cake here is on the pricier side- $7-8 per slice when you can get a whole cake for just a little more money. When I came here I ordered the original matcha cheesecake, which was good but I prefer the unflavored original one. I think it's more worth it to get the tasting platter for $20 something and sharing with friends instead of everyone getting their own slice. The maid cafe style was cute but I imagined the service would be better than it was. If you've ever been to one in Japan, this one definitely cannot compare."}
{"text":"Second time getting angel hat cake from there. After opening it at home, realized the cake was half burnt.. 

Since the cakes are pre packaged you cannot actually see the cake when u buy it unless you take it out of the box while in the Cafe. The quality of the cake is terribly inconsistent."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too busy.

Pros:
- Great ambiance
- Excellent service
- Food tastes good

Cons:
- Drinks are a little sub par."}
{"text":"By far the most entertaining Japanese Cheese cake café in Toronto.  Not nearly as off the wall as the ones in Japan but a good effort and worth the trip downtown. This was my first time here and I brought my friend Jennifer here for her birthday desert treat, and it was a great choice. The waitresses are dressed like French maids and serve as well as entertain. We didn't get to see the show this time, this gives us a reason to come back. The Japanese cheese cake may not be the best in Toronto but it is certainly the most popular.  This place is worth a visit for the entertainment value alone. If you are not sure what to order, go for the platter for two ($24.95), it has a bit of everything and is a great way to sample the entire menu.  This could be a great unique experience if you have friends visiting. Or a spontaneous birthday place when you have no plans. Nothing like it anywhere."}
{"text":"Today I visited Uncle Tetsu Angel Hat Cafe.  It was really a wonderful experience overall.  I found that instead of buying constraint to buying 1 cheesecake, I can buy cheesecakes here directly as many as I wanted.  That's a big plus for me as I really enjoy the fluffy cheesy Japanese cheesecake.  But today, I wanted to just have something matcha again.  I wanted to go to Tsujiri, but their AC is not working and it was so warm in there.  So, I decide to go to Angel Hat cafe instead.  I love their second floor seating area.  It is both cozy and spacious with wonderful lighting and I think they have a little stage located in the inne corner of the restaurant.  Maybe it is for some sort of performance I think.  The Japanese girls dressed in French maid customs are always really nice and friendly.  I decided to order the matcha mousse today.   Surprisingly, the mousse came really fast today, and I was happy with the prompt service.  

And today, I was in for a surprise, the lighting suddenly got dimmed and four of the servers dressed in French maid customs started dancing with amazing energy and they all seemed so happy.  My impression is that they really enjoy the dancing part.  Some patrons even got up to mini stage and started dancing.  I felt so much happier after they finished performing.  I got a little size tracked, the matcha mousse was creamy and tasty with a lot of matcha flavour balanced well by the creaminess of the whipped cream topping and red bean paste.  It was just a wonderful treat.  Thank you Uncle Tetsu!"}
{"text":"Great experience here. Came in just half way through the little maid dance they had on stage. Wish it wasn't so cringgy when they brought some guests up to dance with them. The food is amazing. I usually dislike cheesecakes and can't stand eating them, but they were delicious here! The hot chocolate was very dark (a lot of coco, which is great!). The only reason they lost a star from me is because their service was slow and hard to get their attention..."}
{"text":"I came in here on a whim, we were walking by and a maid greeted us outside so we decided to try it! The atmosphere is super cute, lots of adorable decor and pink walls. We tried all the different cheesecakes and I had a Nyan Hot Chocolate. I LOVE the effort put into plating the food in a cute way. I've never been to Japan or to a maid cafe so initially I felt a little culture shocked. Prices are expensive - but in my opinion worth it for the presentation."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a maid-themed cafe, this is your go to location. The staff are very friendly and accommodating! This location serves hot food until 9:00PM, which after they serve only dessert.

The dessert menu has something for all kinds of cravings but may be a little pricey for some.

If you're looking for hot food - try the Special Omurice for a surprise!

Overall, the food and service are great, this is a nice location for a new experience :)!"}
{"text":"Uhh, well as you can see in the photo, the sundae they gave me was hollow. 6$ for a hollow sundae. You have to be really cheap to do these kinds of tricks on customers. Safe to say I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high after having been to maid cafes in Japan...but their maids didn't play any games with us, there was no \"magic\" to the food and drinks serves to us, and the restaurant in general wasn't really that cute. The food wasn't good, the ice cream was nothing close to Tsujiri, the place with very hot (I think their AC was broken), but the cakes were as good as the ones you can buy to go. For $7.95 you can get a slice for sit down, or $10 for a whole cake to go. Next time I'll stick with eating the cake at home."}
{"text":"The design is nice, the customer service was ok, was the dessert is definitely not worth it...7 dollars for a small slice of cheesecake?! I could pay 3 extra dollars for 7 more slices if I bought the cheesecake from uncle tetsu store!"}
{"text":"I wanted to see what all the hype was about so I came by for dessert yesterday evening and ordered the strawberry angel hat ($10). It was a decent size that could easily serve 2-3, but still felt a little pricey. The cake itself was quite nice - I would describe the taste as fluffy ice cream. The wait was also rather short which was convenient (this is a good alternative to the original location nearby if you aren't too selective and are looking to save some time). Not bad overall!"}
{"text":"Came only for take-out but heard there's great entertainment here. 

I wanted to try all the different varieties of the cheesecakes here just to compare. And I think I still like the traditional kind. The angel hat is like cheese foam, super light and no substance. This time I tried the lunar cheesecake just to see what it's like. It kind of tastes like cheesecake jello. They basically took the traditional cheesecake and then added some gelatin to it to make it more solid. I mean I can still tastes the cheese in it. And it has a nice crumby crust. But overall I didn't enjoy the texture that much. I still like the traditional \"crumby\" texture of cheesecake. 

Maybe next time I will try to sit-in and enjoy a cup of latte or something."}
{"text":"I loved all of it. The atmosphere, the service, the pastries and coffee. Everything I ordered looked and tasted great and all my friends ordered looked tempting as well. 
Pricy for a coffee place as you might expect but on the same range as Starbucks and at least you get better atmosphere here and latte art. It gets very hot inside and the music is always there but just the right level to have a conversation. As for food, get some cheesecake if you're treating yourself but if you're being practical go get the whole cheesecake another day and buy some whipped cream and strawberries and strawberry sauce because that's basically it. 
The coffee though, have it there :)"}
{"text":"came here with a few friends and had a great time. we went on a Monday night and it was not busy at all (which was nice since we didnt have to wait in line). ordered a latte and a piece of cake. im glad the latte was large because it was a bit pricey. the cake was nice too, i thought the portion was a bit small for the price but if you take little bites it'll feel like enough. we got there in time to see the maid's show and it was so cute. the servers were all so nice and encouraged us to come back. overall very sweet experience"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends. But the menu is very limited and a bit pricey. Do not expect good coffee here. Coffee is very below average, I guess because they are more like dessert place instead of real coffee shop.
On the other hand, dessert is very good even tho it is pricy ?waffle with ice cream is like $14) . I like my angel misu - which is a twist of tiramisu with their cheesecakes base. 
Their dessert plater looks pretty good.ill probably come back to try that if we have more people."}
{"text":"I got the original Japanese cheesecake. I loved the texture and flavour. I will definitely have it again! It's so light, I could have eaten the entire cake on my own if I hadn't split it in half with my friend haha!"}
{"text":"Japanese-themed cafe with staff dressed up in tuxes and maid outfits.
They have a bakery on the ground floor. The cafe is on the second floor.

Popular japanese songs are playing in the background, and if you're not sure what the song is you can just ask one of the staff and they'll tell you. One of the maids noticed we were trying to figure out what the current song is and went over to check without us even asking (but then again we made a huge spectacle of ourselves trying to figure out what the song was).

Because it is run by Uncle Tetsu, their cheesecakes and angel hats are on the menu. You can order it for take-out or just sit-in and enjoy the atmosphere and service.

What's more impressive is the large variety of other food and drinks options that are available to choose from, including various dessert items such as parfaits, crepes, and sundaes. They have an assortment of savory options such as yakisoba, omelette rice (including a custom drawing of your choice on the omelette), and takoyaki.

So whether you're here for a dessert or for a full meal, you have a lot of things to choose from.
All of the dishes are well-plated, so don't forget to bring a camera.

There are performances available each week, which involves singing and dancing from some of the staff. Reservations may be required for some of the larger performances.

You can bring some card or board games to play, but unfortunately you likely won't be able to get one of the staff to join in.

A photo booth is available where you can take pictures with the maids, if you're into that kind of thing."}
{"text":"When I originally reviewed the Angel Cafe I said I wouldn't be back but I've returned at least a half dozen times usually because friends want to go. I must say that this restaurant has grown on me!

The service tends to be hit and miss.  Sometimes I've gotten amazing and friendly service and sometimes I feel ignored.  But I really like the little things that thy do like when they greet you at the door or make the table do cat gestures when you order the nyan nyan choco.

The decor is fun and I like the relaxed feeling of the restaurant.  The Japanese pop music they play is also fun!

The main star, however, is the food.  The food alone makes the visit worthwhile.  I've had all of the cheesecakes, the parfait, nyan nyan choco (hot chocolate) and they're all fantastic.

I feel like the main draw still has to be the food.  Uncle Testsu is known for their cheesecake and if this is the main reason for your visit you can't be disappointed.  The maid cafe aspect is a bonus."}
{"text":"Heard about this place because of my friend. People would line up just to grab a cheesecake? I'm in.. so the first thing you notice is that the bakers are downstairs making all the cheesecakes while the entrance is minuscule. You have to go upstairs for the dining area and take out. The smell was amazing by the way, like butter *drools* my friend got me one because she's the best that way and I wasn't in awe. The cheesecake is light, airy, almost like a sponge cake, and the cheese is very light tasting. I wanted it to be more robust. Maybe if I tried a different flavour, I would enjoy it more. I'm not sure if it's worth the ten dollars. Too bad they don't sell mini versions for like five bucks because then I'd be all over that."}
{"text":"Great place overall. A little bit pricey though. The angel hat was amazing. I barely eat cheesecake because they are usually too heavy for me. But the angel hat was so light yet delicious - like a slice of cloud melting in your mouth. Disappointed with the drink since I paid $4.75 for green tea and ended up getting a pot of hot water and a tea bag. Also don't recommend their matcha products if you prefer the traditional Japanese matcha flavor. Tried matcha ice cream and cheesecake and both tasted way too sweet."}
{"text":"I always love Uncle Tetsu's cheese cake. Whenever I am in Asia, this is always on my \"must have\" list. So excited to find they are now in Toronto. I passed by this location by accident. Walked in right away, got a cake & their famous rusk. Hmmm... Same taste as what I had in Japan and Taiwan. Loving it!!!"}
{"text":"Just wow. 

This is the cutest uncle tetsus takeout I have ever seen with a dressed maid at the takeout window too! 

I loved the ambience off the street and how welcoming she was as well! The cheesecake was delicious and bouncy and everything I had hoped it to be. 

Yummm! It was so fluffy, I think I could eat the whole thing myself! $10 for a Japanese cheesecake for yourself. Yes ple"}
{"text":"It's a little pricy but for a special occasion (my birthday) where we wanted to do something a little different, it was perfect. We made a reservation for a group of 10 which they were easily able to accommodate, caught the free weekend sneak peek performance (review within a review: A for effort), got to take a bunch of fun photobooth pictures that were emailed to us, and binged on a variety of delicious desserts.

The dessert platter ($24.50) isn't the most economical, but for the variety and looks it's an excellent choice for 2 people - though I'm sure I could have taken care of it myself if I tried. Can't pick a fave cake.

Hoji latte ($5.25) was too expensive for what it was, and despite wanting to replace most of my bloodstream with hojicha, I wouldn't get it again.

If you're listening, Uncle T, I wish there was a veg omurice option - I'd return on a regular occasion if there was!"}
{"text":"We had to wait forever in line, to get the order and to get the food as well. I tried their classic cheesecake and did not find anything that special about it."}
{"text":"Omg this place is so freaking adorable! I've been wanting to come here since it opened and I finally did last night. 
It was one of my friends birthday so we ordered the original uncle tetsu cheesecake and the mango flavoured shaved ice with matcha and maple jelly. 
The maids sang happy birthday to my friend and we got a picture with them.

Love it! Definitely coming back. The maids were too kawaii."}
{"text":"This was quite a homage to my childhood love of the anime Kaichou was Maid-sama. Things like omu rice and karaage really brought the experience to life!

 I went with a large group of friends and we tried many of their offerings. All of the food was served timely and the service was very friendly! Our maid drew a cat on our omu rice and led us in a \"magic spell\" to make it taste better :3 The food is all made quite well, though personally I don't believe that the matcha parfait is worth the price. 

The reason you come to this location is for the experience, and that's truly what we got, we were even allowed to out on maid costumes and take photos! I will be coming back the next time I'm in Toronto"}
{"text":"Having been told of my friends' experiences here and the wonderful cheesecake from their other stores, I knew I had to give this place a shot. So I returned on a Sunday for their live performances (I believe they also happen on Tuesdays & Wednesdays)! 

This is a maid cafe that is popular style of cafe in Japan where waitresses dress as maids and even perform on some nights. Luckily, I showed up at 8:30PM to others which was when the performance began! It was a choreographed song and dance number of three waitresses. All the songs were Japanese (including J-Pop and the Sailor Moon theme), but it doesn't matter if you don't speak because its a very lively experience and the entire crowd really gets into it! The performers also give some lucky guests a chance to go up and join their dance squad! The 30 minute free to watch performance really added to the whole experience. We even had a chance to meet the real Uncle Tetsu who happened to be there that night! 

The food was also very good! We had the angel hat, lunar cheesecake, and matcha latte. Similarly to the other Uncle Tetsu desserts, they are very delicious, fluffy, and good value.

My only compliant was that our waiter happened to forget about us and did not take our order until we asked twice (about 20 minutes in to arriving). Other than that, the staff are very nice and the performances were pretty cool! If you're up for something new, I would recommend going a bit before 8:30 as it was a packed house with people out the door as soon as the performance began!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great cafe, and amazing cakes! They also have beverages and ice cream. I had the Strawberry Angel Hat Cake and it was delicious! I will be going back again for more!"}
{"text":"Pro : Sweet Staff, the place look cute and cozy. The chocolat cheese cake was delicoous and well presented.

Con : No real con it depends if you like the \"maid cafe \"  concept or not 

The funny thing is that in Japan those cafe aim for males and here i guess its mostly a girl talk spot."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have coffee and desserts and stumbled into this cafe. Right away we felt weird about all the young women is maid outfits. I'm sure that's a big reason people go to this place, but it was just a tad creepy to us.

The desserts were great. We shared the Dessert Platter amongst 3 people. It included: Angel Hat Cheesecake in Original and Strawberry, Original Cheesecake in Matcha and Original, Lunar Cheesecake trio and the Matcha Parfait, plus three sauces.

We really enjoyed the Angel Hat Cheesecakes, the Chocolate Lunar Cheesecake and the Matcha Parfait.

The service was a bit lack luster. It's mostly a show, a performance done by all these asian women dressed as maids. In terms of actually being asked orders, provided water and cutlery, it wasn't timely or efficient.

I think if you're really laid back and have a lot of time to waste, this is a great place to come try a bunch of desserts. You'll also have to be cool with the maids bit. But as a regular spot... not really. Unless the maid bit is your thing."}
{"text":"This is a Japanese maid-style cafe. The whole concept is maid-like \"angels\" dressed in cosplay French-maid outfits wait on and serve customers. The \"angels\" also occasionally perform - dance and sing. The concept may not be for everyone. 

The cafe serves a wide range of desserts (including the famous Uncle Tetsu cheesecakes) and drinks.  If it is your first time at the cafe, I would recommend getting the dessert platter that would allow you to try all of the different Uncle Tetsu cakes. The \"Angel Hat\" cake is one of the best.

I would recommend this place with a caveat that it is not for everyone."}
{"text":"wayy to pricey . over $5 for a tea latte. $4 for normal tea!! crazy."}
{"text":"3.5 rating

Stopped by this evening after a long day downtown. It was around 8pm and the place was pretty packed! Lucky for us we were able to get seats quickly. The cafe is a maid theme so you will see all the waitresses in a maid costume which is pretty neat! 

The service here is okay, we were forgotten for a bit until we called the manager over lol. We ordered a slice of yuzu lunar cheesecake, and a slice of the original angel hat with maple sauce. I also asked for some water, but they forgot so I had to call another waitress to bring some.

My favourite of the two would have to be the yuzu cheesecake, you can definitely taste the yuzi flavour but it's not as light as the angel hat. I also thought the yuzu is quite small for the price. They also offer whole cakes for take out!"}
{"text":"tried the tiramisu, pretty good
the interior doesnt really match the cute vibe though"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to visit an Uncle Tetsu shop for awhile and now I'm so glad I finally did. The cheesecake was unreal. So light, fluffy, not overly sweet or cakey. I tried to savour my cake over a span of 3 days and it was so hard not to devour it all in one shot. Next up - the matcha version!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent!  Was there on Saturday afternoon and the place was not busy. 

 Matcha latte was okay - disappointed that I did not get the bear decor 

Soft serve matcha ice cream sundae was good. For $7.95 I do expect it to be a bigger size

It's a great place for groups. Free wifi

But watch out - it's on the pricey side"}
{"text":"*3.5 star rating
I came here on a short little date on a very quiet Tuesday afternoon. I had heard of this maid cafe a few months ago and thought why not, because what could be better than desserts and cute girls? 
When you first enter the building, you have to go upstairs in order to get to the fairly large seating area. Once there, my boyfriend and I were very enthusiastically greeted by the maids and were promptly seated. For this visit we ordered the regular vanilla parfait, the original lunar cake with maple sauce (which is exclusive to Toronto), a matcha latte, and a London fog. Both of the drinks were very good and were pretty large, but the desserts were pretty average. The lunar cheesecake to me tasted like a regular new york cheesecake (but more like a mousse if that makes sense?) and wasn't anything particularly amazing. The portion was also very small for the price you pay. The parfait was also nothing special for something that cost around $12. I didn't try the other desserts yet, but I have heard that the angel hats are very good, so maybe my rating will go up once I get my hands on one of those.
However, despite the desserts not quite living up to my expectations, I still think this cafe is worth checking out because the service here is so unique and cute. The maids are attentive and all extremely friendly. Not to mention, the drinks were not only tasty but also came with some great latte art. I got a snorlax on my matcha latte. Definitely worth coming here if you're in the area to get some drinks and experience the maid cafe culture."}
{"text":"This is Toronto's BIGGEST WELL-KEPT SECRET!  No one knows about this place - but everyone knows about the Uncle Tetsu location on Bay & Dundas, where there is always a huge line-up and a 1 hour wait.  

Well at this location, there is NO LINE-UP whatsover.  You can buy the original Uncle Tetsu cheese cake (full of fluffy goodness), as well as the famous Angel-hat cake .. that looks like a huge puffed-up marshmellow - but just melts in your mouth,  The cool thing about the angel-hat cake is that it comes in different flavours - try it in original, strawberry, chocolate, green-tea etc.

Now if you've never had Japanese cheese-cake before - you might be in for a shock.  This is nothing like the dense New York cheese-cake you get south of the border. This is extremely fluffy, light, buttery (and perhaps a big egg-y).  It felt weird the first time I ate, but then it kinda grows on you. One cheese-cake is about $10, and comes with famous 'Uncle-Tetsu' seal on top of the cake. Be sure to instagram it, and now you can get it without having the endure the 2 hour wait at the other location.  This location also has a dine-in area on the top floor .. so now you can have your cake and eat it too :)"}
{"text":"If you love maid cafes it's a must! Great service, cute maids! And the deserts were spot on. I forgot the first maid that served us but she was cute ! All I remember was her short hair ! If you see this !!! Thanks for the bunny omelet drawing"}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsu is really popular. During my short trip in Toronto, I always spotted someone carrying a bag from Uncle Tetsu. I purchased their matcha cheesecake. I came in when they just opened, so take out only. The angel cafe wasn't open til later. I enjoyed the cheesecake. It was fluffy, light, and full of matcha flavor."}
{"text":"It's OK. ..over priced latte and hot chocolate...really $7.50.

If you want to see maid dressed girls talking with high pitch voices, this is the place to be.

Best thing would be you font have to line up an hour for their $10 cheese cakes, like the store on bay street.

It's definitely something to try but won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"The service is great! The place is really cute, the cheescake and cofee was just ok, so if you are looking for a fun place to meet your friends rather than excellent pastries...this is it!!!"}
{"text":"Service here was nice but I was disappointed in trying both their lunar cheesecake and angel hat cake. The lunar cheesecake was bland, tasteless, and was basically a jello (but even less taste than a jello) which was not expected since description says it is a more cheesy and dense cheesecake compared to their original. Also one slice is TINY... what did you pay for?

The angel hat cake tasted better but still very light and boring in flavour and texture. I tried the strawberry and it tastes like those sponge/castella cakes with a tiny hint of flavour.

The sundae was good and listed on their special menu. I had the matcha and it was flavoured well. Pricey for the small amount of ice cream. Could have added better texture instead of tasteless cornflakes. Probably wouldn't come back unless to pick up an original cheesecake if I ever crave it..."}
{"text":"I was curious about this place so decided to stop by here for dinner with my cousin on a Sunday. We arrived around 5pm and the place was pretty full. The hostess asked us if we're okay with sitting in the middle and I said yes. I thought she meant middle of the room but she actually meant sitting in the middle of a long table side by side with strangers lol. 
To the left of me was a couple complaining about how hard their lives are and to my right was a date happening. It was really hard to not listen to their conversations because they were so close and we can hear them perfectly, heck I can hear the couple at the end of the table perfectly too because they were pretty loud lol. 

We ordered yakisoba and omurice to share and I also ordered a matcha latte. I'm slightly disappointed that my latte art didn't have a bear on it like in the menu. The food took a while to come and pretty much dug in shortly after it arrived. 
To be honest the food wasn't that great. The yakisoba had a slight sour taste to it. The omurice was okay. The matcha latte was okay but a little bit watered down. 

This cafe is most likely better for desert than actual food. I was also hoping to catch a show but there wasn't any while we were there :( 

Other than the mediocre food the service is really good. The servers were very friendly and happy. It pretty much puts everyone in a good. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here again lol"}
{"text":"I'm normally not too big of a fan of these types of cafes, but I can appreciate the effort and quality of desserts offered here. The servers were very polite and kind, and it definitely felt like a very authentic Japanese establishment. Maybe they were too kind to the point that a creepy patron just straight up asked a server for her number without even saying hi.

The desserts are largely similar to their cheesecake restaurant down the street and were soft to the bite. It isn't too different from other local baked goods, but the atmosphere and setting was quite nice to just have a seat and enjoy tea and cakes with friends. 

I probably wouldn't voluntarily come back here unless someone wanted to, but I would look elsewhere to satisfy that sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Their original cheesecake is amazing! It's lightly sweet and fluffy and i can literally eat the whole
Thing on my own! 

My husband was recently in the Toronto downtown area and was able to pick up some cheesecake for us. He asked which one was best and the staff recommended the original. We had some this evening and we were hooked!!! 

I cannot wait to go back and try other new desserts and food but I will definitely always take the cheesecake to go from here every time I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"very cute cafe. all the waitresses and waiters seemed to really enjoy their job and were friendly from the start. a good variety of drinks and desserts at fair prices. but i wouldn't go there for dinner - 90% of the menu is desserts. i enjoyed the interactive concert performance. i would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and thought it was alright. I'm a huge fan of all things Japanese so I had to try this out once I learnt about it. I'm glad I went. The place is casual and staffed with pretty cute maids. All the girls are super nice and friendly. They really lacked service skills and  work ethic which was rather annoying, but I couldn't hold it against them since they were hired to be pretty and cute instead. The savoury foods were standard and their drinks were awesome!  Didn't have room for desserts, but will return regardless of service because.. Maids kittens and rainbows yay!"}
{"text":"Came here during my visit in Toronto and it was a great experience. I came on one of the day where they had a deal where if you finish one of their parfait in 2 minutes, it's free! 
I didn't do the challenge because the parfait was big and I ended up not finishing it, however my friend did it and finished within 2 minutes. 
The service was pretty good, they order your food through their phones, better than writing it down. 
I didn't really like the matcha parfait that much because the cake was too dry and I didn't know they had red bean. 
Overall, the restaurant is cute, but if you're a tourist, make sure you only swipe visa because I tried swiping discover and she said I wasn't charged but the screen said approved and I was charged at the end."}
{"text":"nice cakes. *^_^* not super sugary. Japanese style.
cute servers 
and cute environment *^_^*"}
{"text":"Love the cheesecake here. The best Japanese cheese cake in town! It is not your typically New York cheese cake. The texture is smooth, sponge like and super moist.   If there is no line up I would definitely pick up one. I saw this new location when I walking around downtown. There is no line up here when I came on Saturday night whereas the other locations had multiple people lining up. What's new here is the angel hat which was sold out by the time I got there. I would recommend picking up one earlier to avoid disappointment. There is also a cafe upstairs where you can enjoy your slice of cake and tea. The waiters are dressed up like Japanese waiters which I thought was different and unique as this would be the first. I can never get sick of this cheese cake as it is not super creamy/cheesy. Has just the right amount of sponge and cheese."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and the desserts are great. Fluffy cheesecake..not too sweet and the angel hats are nice and light and so much flavour. Lattes were also great. Waitresses were kind and helpful but the hours kids do of sucks.  1 pm on Sunday is when they start serving in the cafe."}
{"text":"Finally gave this place a try. I came here with D and his sister, who was in town for a visit. I have tried their original cheese cake before and I have to say it is good. But in my opinion, I wouldn't wait in line to get one. The cafe, was an interesting experience. It was nicely decorated, but I find it stuffy in the cafe. The servers are nice and cute - although English level is less than average at times. It is not that the deserts and the items on the menu is not good. The deserts we ordered and the drink that I ordered was good. But I think it is over priced for what you get. The maid show was interesting, but I don't think this is my kind of cafe. If you like the cute, cute Japanese anime-like atmosphere then give this place a try. But, I personally like my coffee shops better."}
{"text":"L O C A T I O N 
Corner of Dundas St W and Centre Ave. If you see the AGO (Art Gallery of Ontario) then you're on the right tract! I do not recommend driving here because it's on a busy street and parking is a hassle. The cafe/dining area is upstairs. There will be a maid (waitress) in the bottom floor counter if you have any questions. 
F O O D + D R I N K S
//Original Cheesecake//(6.95) It is the original cheesecake and it was light and fluffy. It had a strawberry and some blueberries on whipped cream. A simple and cute dessert.
//Matcha Latte// (5.75) Not gonna lie, I was kinda disappointed when the latte art wasn't a bear or anything creative. It was a basic rosetta that any latte artist can make. The drink itself was ok and it came in a big cup. 
//Nyan-Nyan Choco// (7.50) The reason why this drink is pricey is because the maid makes you and everyone at your table \"BLESS\" this drink. That's it. You pay for the cute/cringy experience. I personally liked it, but it's a little too pricey for a minute of interaction with the maid. Besides that this is pretty much hot chocolate with a marshmallow cat paw. 
S E R V I C E 
Our maid was polite and not overly enthusiastic about her job. She's just like any other server. Maybe I was hoping for a more interactive experience?
O V E R A L L
This establishment was cute and all but no wow factor. Maybe because this is the first maid cafe in Toronto so staff don't have to try as hard? The food and drinks were mediocre and a little pricey. Besides that there are plenty of seating options, such as,  couches, small tables, long tables. I'd probably try this place again for their show."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon by chance-- I didn't know there was a third edition to the Uncle Tetsu's franchise! Surprisingly, there was no line up at all. We were greeted with an enthusiastic staff dressed like a maid right at the door who gave us menus and guided us upstairs to the cafe. 

We decided to get takeout for the original Angel hat ($10) because dining in for a slice a fraction of the cake was not worth it. The cashier was extremely helpful and attentive and I appreciated that he asked if he may put the receipt in the bag unlike most cashiers who just shove the paper in the bag automatically (Bonus point +1). 

To my surprise, the cutlery and napkin was folded so beautifully (another bonus point!.) You won me over with the impressive presentation and smart packaging before I even had a bite.

The cake is a perfect size to share with a friend; you don't feel full and heavy after eating it. The texture is incredibly light and fluffy-- even lighter with less cheese taste than the original Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake on 598 Bay Street. Eating the Angel hat is like eating sweet foamy egg whites. 

This place gets high points for service, presentation, food quality and consistency. A little pricey for $10 a small cake, but I guess it's because of the hype and overall experience."}
{"text":"Order anything but the shaved ice. Mango and strawberry flavours are the worst. 

We ordered the matcha shaved ice. But only it didn't come with condensed milk as it was supposed to so I tasted only ice - I was paying $10 for ice, and the ice was quite chunky as well. We asked for more milk and flavour but was asked it would be charged extra :( 

Another customer sitting beside us ordered the mango shaved ice and was faced with the same problem, and the manager never showed up to resolve the complaint."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went with my boyfriend and we were notified that if we are staying, we need to order at least $10 per person. A week ago I went with my girlfriends and there was no such rule. 

The menu was also changed. The first time I ordered an original angel hat with maple syrup, and the second time I ordered a matcha parfait ($12.50), which is made up of matcha mousse, cornflakes, whipped cream, red bean paste matcha syrup, Macha soft serve and Japanese matcha cheesecake. The parfait was good, but i felt like I've had too much matcha and couldn't finish it.
My bf ordered a matche lunar cheesecake and a cold Vanilla latte. 
I chose parfait because I couldn't decide which desert to order, so i had a little combination of everything. 

We like the atmosphere there, warm and welcoming, with good lighting."}
{"text":"At first glance, the cafe appeared to be one of those pick-up bakeries where you come in, order your food, pick it up and go. When we came in, we were surprised to see a set of stairs that lead upstairs. As we walked passed the kitchen area (where you can see the staff meticulously preparing angel hat cakes that I'll definitely be trying out in the future) and got to the top floor, we were immediately greeted with a very loud \"WELCOME!\" in Japanese by several servers dressed as maids. The scene immediately brought to mind one of those maid cafes that you would find in Japan. The ambiance was very energetic and lively. I was also pleased to see that the cafe was pretty spacious as well! Lots of large couches and large, group-sized tables. 

The maid cafe is certainly a first for Toronto! The server that we had was very informative and attentive. I noticed that all of the other servers were like that as well - kudos for Uncle Tetsu's for having good service! 

Food-wise, it was really good. I had the classic matcha angel cake with red bean. I really liked the matcha sauce that came with the cake as well! Price-wise, it was a bit high. However, then again, you do get a large portion for the size of the slice of cake.

Decor-wise, Uncle Tetsu's could be a tad bit livelier if they had more decor on the walls. If it weren't for the costumes that the staff had to wear, I would've thought it was any other run of the mill in Toronto.

Overall, I would definitely recommend stopping by at Uncle Tetsu's Angel Cafe. Great desserts, lots of space, and great service!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times times now and the cake here is just PHENOMENAL. Tried all 3 versions: the angel hat, the lunar, and original. Even though they give you like quarter of the cake, I always end up craving more. The angel hat texture is unparalleled, like eating a cloud. Also, the drinks are adorable and great for pictures. They have a nyan nyan choco where the servers make everyone do the cute cat gestures.
The maid aspect of the cafe also makes the experience more fun. Sadly, every time time we went there was no performance, so I think they really need to increase the \"sneak peek\" days. The full concert days include a fee as well. I just want to see snow halation performed live!
They also have a photo booth on stage that my friends think are cringe but TBH I think deep down they love it. 
Anyways, if the prices were lower I'd give this a 5 stars. The cakes themselves are worth going to experience."}
{"text":"Angel Cafe, aka Japanese Maid Cafe. I seen them on TV before from Japanese travel shows but I always felt weird going to places like this, but I decided to come here with friends one day after work. When I first arrived, it was pretty packed, I thought it was just busy, not until I was seated I found out they had a preview performance on their weekly performance act/concert on the weekend. It was pretty entertaining to see the girls in maid dresses dancing to VERY catchy Japanese songs (AKB48 i think?) and they actually go down to grab people to dance with them on stage which was pretty funny to watch. After their dance, the girls will introduce themselves and they are back to their regular work, getting your orders and delivering food to your table. If you want to take pictures with the maids, you can do so too on the stage with a camera set up with a nice backdrop.

Food and drink wise, I enjoyed the ice cream, latte and cake I shared with my friends and with the entertainment provided, I think it was worth it.  The matcha was good and the latte arts were amazing!  To be honest, I actually had a good time, it was a very different kind of experience."}
{"text":"The staff here were v friendly and hospitable. The venue itself was cozy and instagrammable. The only issue I have is that their FULL takeout cakes ARE limited. I went with two of my friends and shared 3 different types of cakes, each of which had their own individuality to them: matcha green tea original cheesecake, original plain angel hat, and the plain lunar cheesecake. My favourite is definitely the angel hat cake because it is the most moist and fluffy out of the three. If you like smooth, new york style cheesecake... go with the lunar. Joanne, Ashlee and I made a creation that you juuust might want to try with your friends too: a slice of angel hat OVER a slice of lunar. The mixture of textures, along with the layer of graham from the lunar will blow your mind. & mouth. Trussss mi daddi!"}
{"text":"I loved it! This is the most cutest cafe I've been too in my life!  and the desserts and drinks are all a reasonable price and the service was absolutely great! If you ever come here this is a very good place have a nice dessert especially if your into Japanese culture! I'll be definitely coming back here when I'm in Toronto again"}
{"text":"Nice environment. Food is mediocre and bit over priced for some. I got the matcha flavoured ice cream which was $5 and I definitely enjoyed it. For me this is a one time visit as I expected more from a cafe and maybe not my kind of setting. Great for people that loves pink and maids though!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most adorable and greatest cafe experience I've ever had. Incoming rambling.
We were immediately welcomed by all of the staff with a loud ???????? and seated at a table. The place was very full, but we were still tended to very effeciently.
All of the servers are dressed as maids or butlers and are SO friendly and welcoming. 
There is a stage used for idol performances on specific days of the week, which could invite a lot of J-Pop fans into the cafe. Their setlists usually include a few different popular idol groups such as AKB48.
Their menu is very large and includes a few variants of the famous Uncle Tetsu's cheesecake. I got an Angel Hat, which I've found that I like a bit more than the original, haha. There is also another notable addition, the Lunar Cheesecake. 
The cheesecakes come in different flavours at the cafe as well. Instead of the choice of original or matcha as per the regular store, you now have additional choices of strawberry or chocolate.  
If you are a fan of idols, or just love cute cafes with amazing food in general, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We came for Angel Hat Cake takeout.  We bought the matcha hat cake and the original hat cake.  Both were pretty good actually.....also NO LINEUP!   Which was a big plus.   The hat cake was denser then their regular cheese cake that usually a gummy texture when firmed up, or tasted like whipped egg foam when warm.     Their hat cakes are good, would probably go back and try the other flavours.   

As for the entertainment, the maid cafe looked cute.....but we didn't stay for that.  Their Bio's are hilarious!  They have their photos and a little bit about each of them.   

Here's the place to go if you want to get uncle tetsu cakes without lining up!"}
{"text":"Really yummy desserts and fun atmosphere i recommend anyone to try this place. only thing i dont like is that the glasses for water are too small and the water is room temperature. It takes a while for the maids to see that you have no more water. then again we should get taller glasses to drink from"}
{"text":"This place is on the second floor of an uncle tetsu take out place. It has lots of seating and never really had an issue with waiting for seats.

This is more of a dessert place but i did not crave desert and order a rice dish. It came with beef, onions and mushrooms. It literally came with one tiny piece of beef. The dish itself was also one of the worse dishes of my life. It did not taste good at all.

I don't recommend coming here for anything other than desserts."}
{"text":"There was small line up but staff were just chatting and cracking jokes. 

Ordered 1 of each flavour for the tarts. They were already in little bags. 

Before leaving, peeked into bags, the cake is dried out, discoloured and gross. 

 Asked to exchange for ones on trays, both girls were reluctant and replied, \"then which one do you want?\"

For $3.45 per small tart, I think we all deserve fresher tarts and better service"}
{"text":"I've never been to a place like this. My sister begged me to go, so I looked it up and it definitely wasn't somewhere I was interested in going( it all seemed to cute). But we hopped on the train, opened the door, and was invited by the delicious smells of Japanese cheesecake. We then go upstairs and there are girls dressed in maid outfits dancing on stage. I changed my mind and fell in love with the place. Its all cute...the decorations, the food, the drinks, the girls! Apparently we caught them on a night when they do preview performances of their full length show. They even have soy milk, so for those that see all the amazing drinks but think they can't have it due to dairy intolerance, drink away! 
I really loved the vanilla bean latte, but my sister wasn't a fan. 
ALSO it's better to come here for the cheesecake than the other downtown location since the line is usually short/non-existent."}
{"text":"What a lovely place. The smell of their famous cheesecakes hugs you as walk in. Upstairs the service is friendly and fun without being in your face.  Had the Omurice. It was more delicious than I expected. Melon cream soda - yum. Stocked up on cheesecake for home. Must try?  The RUSKS!  Addictively yummy."}
{"text":"Went out of way to get a cheese cake from this place as it gets a lot of attention.

I picked up a cake for take out so can't comment on dining room experience. The gal who served me had on a cute uniform and was very customer oriented.

I picked up a Matcha Cheese Cake which was still warm.  It was light, fluffy and delicious!

Would I return? Yes
Would I recommend? Yes"}
{"text":"A fun, relaxing, cute place for a meal. I enjoyed the homely atmosphere, the sweet food, and the conversations with the maids.

This contrasts with maid cafes in Japan, which seem to be busy, have interactions scripted, and are an aggressive cash grab. This maid cafe in Toronto is the exact opposite, and plays well with the local norms.

The menus are a bit confusing because they give you 3 different ones. Nonetheless, the cold desserts, the warm and filling food, and other items are worth getting. You will not be disappointed with the choices on the menu.

They officially call this place Uncle Tetsu's Japanese Angel Cafe, but everybody knows it as a maid cafe. Maybe such a name is too risque and has the wrong connotations. Either way, my friends keep coming back to this place and posting their photos on social media, showing their food, their adventures with friends, random posing, and the maid dances as well. People seem to like the place.

Unusually, the washrooms are gender-neutral - there are 5 small rooms that have their own toilet, sink, and mirror. I haven't seen this arrangement at any other public facility, and it seems to be done well."}
{"text":"I love its cheesecake! They are the best! Very moist and fluffy. The angle-hat cake is just as good as the cheesecake. The ambiance and the atmosphere of the cafe are pleasant. It is spacious, not dark or packed at all. The servers are fine, some of them friendly and smiling, some neutral without any facial expressions, but all if them are quick and helpful."}
{"text":"It's a small place, and was busier than I expected.

I won't bother wasting time with formalities.

I ordered my first ever fancy latte in a restaurant and boy was I disappointed.  The paper menu showed a teddy bear in the latte but what I got was a heart and a not fancy one at that.

We ordered the matcha waffle and the regular waffle with ice cream and whipped cream and fruit.

It was ok, but the ice cream melted too quickly and the waffle was soggy.

Would i go back?  Maybe to try something else.  

Very expensive..."}
{"text":"The place. 

It's just like any other sit down place, with the dressed up maids as your server. It's an interesting concept. The servers are all so nice and polite and they take your order on their iTouch. Apparently, the dancing only takes place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Sunday. 

The food. 

I got the chocolate lunar cheesecake. I'd say it's basically like a real cheesecake, not like the original cheesecake. To me, the original cheesecake is the fluffiest, the Angel hat is a bit smoother and the lunar is the most dense. 

I ordered the lunar cake and my friend got the angel hat. After trying each other's food, we ended up plates. Hence, I highly recommend you go with a friend, because it makes it possible to taste a variety of cakes. 

I also got the matcha latte. I found it too bitter compared to other matcha lattes I've had... Not sure if that's how the original latte should taste like. I also tried my friend's order of mocha. You can really taste the coffee at first, but once you mix everything in, then it's much better. If I were to go back there, I'd get the mocha drink. 

I'm overall not as impressed. Although I would like to come back to see some awesome dancing."}
{"text":"Was going for take out for some red bean matcha cheesecake but was surprised by the line up for something.  Asked the manager and he said it's a maid show.   signed up for it but don't know if I can get a spot.  This is at 8:45pm.  To me I assume this will be the go to place for Toronto's Little Tokyo! 

EDIT: when the bill came, the show was charged as $10 per person.  Was surprised because we didn't know, but it was still a good deal and a good show."}
{"text":"$10 tax included for a whole cheesecake? Sign me up!

The cakes are delicious and fluffy and not overly sweet. 

My only complaint is that the matcha flavour wasn't available during the weekend I went (only sold on Monday and Thursday) so I didn't get to try that."}
{"text":"We were looking for a Japanese-themed place to meet, and you can't get anymore 'cute' Japanese than this second floor cafe above the bakery. Its liberally splashed with pink, the waitresses in french maid outfits, and the food comes with animal faces on them. I applaud waitresses' ability to stay cheery, smiling and endlessly energetic the whole time we were there. Even when shuttling items back and forth through the busy crowds of people, taking orders or explaining the menu. 

I had the dark hot chocolate, which was passable...sugary, dark, frothy and came in a large mug. However, it was barely above room temperature and therefore not hot enough for my tastes. Another got the omurice, which is a special menu item. The waitress brings the plate, teaches you to cast a special tasty spell (there are hand actions and a chant), and draws your animal of choice in ketchup for you. You've never had service like this before, be prepared for an intensely cute interaction. Various drinks were ordered but none of them had any cute animal latte art on them - that was slightly disappointing. Some at the table got cake slices which comes in generous portions. One slice is a little less than a quarter of the cake, and comes with a choice of sauce. 

In summary, the food was okay but the experience is definitely interesting."}
{"text":"Walking by and a young woman in a fluffy sleeved maid's outfit opened the door and asked us to come in so we did.  

Have to say weird vibe, food fine but service boo. 

They have to really get their act together. The wait staff was obviously inexperienced and disorganized. Our order of one slice of matcha cheesecake, a matcha latte and an Americano took forever to come that we ate our cake before our drinks came. 

Also they forgot the cookie and fruit garnish on the naked wad of cream and when I asked about it, they awkwardly brought a ramekin with a quarter slice of strawberry and a cookie 20 mins after we finished our cake. 

feeling about this place  ....






."}
{"text":"We visited 2 hours before closing and we were disappointed that the menu was limited. I see other people ordering other things and when I asked about it they said it was all done. There's still 2 hours till they closed!

Tried the Japanese float, that was soo sweet and nothing great! 
We also ordered the pudding dessert and a chocolate dessert that's not on the menu. 

It was ok, nothing great. I think people pay to see the cuteness of the ambiance and they sometimes a have a show on. Other than that I wasn't too thrilled"}
{"text":"Japanese Cheesecake is ALWAYS better than NY Cheesecake. 
Light and fluffy with egg beating! Simple and delicate to the tongue. 
Delicious and delectable aroma and fulfillment. 

Please go there for the cheesecake and rate. 
Everything else is not their main purpose, so don't rate when you don't know what to order."}
{"text":"Cute service with lots of seatings. They have shows where there's a portion that's a interactive with the people watching. 

Food was alright- desserts taste better. It was a good experience."}
{"text":"Very cute place, the high pitch voice kinda weird but I guess that what Japanese cafe or maid cafe are like, I had a dessert sampler n I got to taste diff dessert and my friend have the omurice, I liked it and was quite cute. I would def go back :)"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of hype and decent cheesecake.

Our waitress was too busy chatting up the table two down while we waited fifteen minutes for our bill after asking.  Another waitress was nice enough to get us out of there.  It was cool to see them baking on the first floor and get the feel of the place.  I'd call it a tourist trap to be honest.  We tried the high hat and angel cake, one plain and one strawberry.  One was a little too eggy and soft, the other had flavor lacking.

Something I really liked was the bathrooms- no male or female, just a hallway with several doors so you could just go and take care of business.  Takes away the fuss."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to stop by this cafe, and was pleasantly satisfied,  Unlike the first Uncle Tetsu Cheesecake and Matcha brand cake stores down the street with the long line ups that look like people are in line for Metallica tickets; this place provides a dine in atmosphere to sit back and eat desserts with cute waitresses dressed in maid costumes that can be found at your local adult stag shop or one of  those Halloween costume shops with the description title: \"Sexy Maid Costume\" on the package.  Anyways,  I ended up getting a small bowl of chocolate mousse ice cream with wafer crumbles in it which was good.  

As you enter this cafe, you actually get to see the jaded looking bakers actually make the cakes and nonchalantly tell you: \"Ugh...just go to the cafe is upstairs\" and then you are positively greeted by a waitress and subsequently by the other waitresses in a chant in Japanese all at the same time as you enter the dining room upstairs that has a stage.  The stage is set for the waitresses to provide a theatrical dance during some parts of the day.  

So ultimately, as you enter this cafe, it's similar to being dumped in a relationship (jaded bakers) and then finding someone who is positive and wants to engage in a relationship with you (the waitresses at the top of the stairs) all happening within 2 minutes of your life.

Definitely, worth a visit :)"}
{"text":"I just came for original cheesecake and sorry but i just dont get it. Its just not special at all. Have had much better cake elsewhere"}
{"text":"Went during the summer on a weekday, not busy at all. Walking upstairs, the decor was shockingly bland, I was imagining hello kitty or anime themes. The maids were very cute, but a bit disappointed as they did not address customers according to maid café traditions haha (but it's Canada, didn't expect too much.) the food came pretty slow, but it was delicious! The noise level is somewhat quiet so it's a good place to go with a date.

Ps. Guys please don't selfie with a maid if you are on a date."}
{"text":"Bought the matcha angel hat cheesecake and personally I think it is better than the original cheesecake. Its very very light and fluffy  that just melts in your mouth. Went in around 7 and there wasn't a line up which is a plus compared to the other stores down the street.

So far I'm enjoying the new cheesecake, net time I visit I will try some of their drinks."}
{"text":"Aside from the cheesy Japanese hostesses the cheese cakes here are so delicious. Light and fluffy without the heavy cheese texture that sits on your tongue. I'm amazed at how light the cake is, it tastes almost like moist pound cake. We tried both the strawberry and regular cheese cakes. The little cracker that comes with it is delicious as well. It's a light cracker with layers inside that seem to crumble in your mouth. Definitely getting a cake to-go next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Nooooo! They don't have the Yuzu cheesecake anymore which was what I went there for. The show is not free anymore compare to when they first opened which sucked. Glad I went before. I tried curry udon, but the udon noodle is not as thick as other restaurants that I went to, not sure if this is just due to Japanese style. It was still tasty though. Then I tried Angel cafe's own iteration of tiramisu.  Their standard cheesecake plus espresso powder and whipped cream. I like it but prefer Italian tiramisu better probably due to mascarpone cheese. I tried houji tea latte, even though it's just tea bag, but still have intense fragrance of the toasted green tea."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

Okay I'm a sucker for these places. You pay for the atmosphere and ambience, not so much the food, although the food/drinks were also not bad.

This place opened up sometime last month, and it's a popular hangout spot for students and young professionals who want to...I won't go there. You get what I mean. The waitresses in the restaurant are called \"maids\", which is consistent of what many female servers in Japan are regarded to as. Note that on weekends there's a $10 minimum charge each person.

I've been here twice now, both times ordering a chocolate lunar cheesecake. The first time I tried the matcha latte, while the second time I tried the matcha green tea. I also ordered an angel plate the second time around, where the maid gets to draw (or write) a custom message on the omelette using ketchup.

The chocolate lunar cheesecake was surprisingly very good both times, and was definitely worth the ~$6 charge. As for the matcha drinks, I preferred the latte over the tea, as the tea was way too bitter for my liking. The omelette in my angel plate was surprisingly fluffy, similar to their original cheesecakes. Everything else in the plate was nothing special, but hey it was something neat to try.

If you're lining up in the original Uncle Tetsu store and are wanting to buy an angel hat cake, come here instead. They have a wide selection of angel hat cakes for takeout and you don't have to wait an hour in the old lineup.

Service was very good, and you can tell the maids love what they're doing. Their accents can be a bit rough at times, so do be patient in communicating. Either way I'd definitely return here, maybe to catch a show in the future (both times I went during the day)."}
{"text":"When I walked in, I was surprised that the place wasn't as packed as I thought it would be on a Saturday afternoon. Regardless of that, it was a cool experience! I ordered the matcha latte, and omurice with a custom message from one of the maids. I was a bit mean and told her to draw the uncle tetsu logo but she did pretty well! Service was very friendly! 
The matcha latte was around $6 which is fairly reasonable compared to other cafes. 
The omurice came with a onion bacon soup with a green salad with a interesting dressing I've never had before. Inside the omurice is tomato fried Japanese rice with bacon and peppers. 
Definitely coming back again to see their live show! It's a pretty good hangout place as well!"}
{"text":"It was sweltering hot on the day we went- and for some reason there was no air conditioning at all. Imagine trying to enjoy some cheesecake while it's 30+ degrees Celsius indoors! It's a very spacious area with a handful of maids walking to and fro. The waitresses chat amongst each other and are not the most attentive bunch. 

To be fair, I'm not a huge fan of the cheesecake from Uncle Tetsu to begin with. I find that the taste pales in comparison to other Japanese cheesecake I've sampled throughout my life, and that it's a rather overhyped chain. We purchased the cheesecake sampler (almost $30 in price!!!) with the three different cheesecake types. 

Again, rather underwhelmed by the choices. The lunar cheesecake is a mousse cake. The angel hat tastes like a sponge cake. The original cheesecake is... average. 

.... and these cost $30 in total!!!! What the heck! 

Maybe you'll have a better experience than we did (no AC, mediocre cheesecakes, inattentive waitresses) but I'm definitely not coming back. 

Tip: If you want to watch them dance/perform to J-POP songs, you have to make a 9 pm reservation on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"The original cheese cake, when freshly made, was a combo of the most delicate and tasty cakes one can put in their mouth. It was warm, creamy, spongy, soft, and delicious. 

If compared to a Hostess Twinkie, the Twinkie would be like eating a cold hot dog bun."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of uncle tetsu's creations but stumbling on this cafe was quite a surprise. Being the first maid cafe I've ever went too, the experience was not as exciting but rather a bit uncomfortable for me. The service was slow and everything seemed a bit overpriced. However, the waffle and green tea latte we ordered was delicious. I also got an angel hat to go and compared to the regular cheesecake, the texture is more similar to a mousse. Overall, do not think I will be returning to the cafe!"}
{"text":"I have heard about Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecake all the way from Vancouver. Sister went to Toronto for work and I was so excited. I told her to drop by here and pick up some. Even though by the time it made it back to Vancouver, it was cold but it tasted so good. I was like OMG..... 

Definitely a WOW WOW WOW. It was light, fluffly and cheesy at the same time. It was really fresh. 

I loved it. I need to make a trip out there and pick up some more. So delicious. Definitely an eyeopener. I am excited that Vancouver will open up one very soon at Metrotown. So can't wait for that to happen."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here! It's definitely something you will want to do at least once!

The cafe seating area is lovely and spacious, but I can see how it may get crammed during peek hours! The interior is covered in lovely pastel colours, and all of the staff are very friendly!

It was my birthday so I got the dessert platter to share with my boyfriend. It was amazing to try everything the cafe had to offer for only $25! Not all of the items on the platter are what they have, but it's a good majority! You definitely have to share with someone, as we were both feeling stuffed by the end! Definitely needed a third person LOL!

Our waitress was adorable, she was very familiar with the menu and was more than happy to help us with our questions. She engaged in conversation with us and was very sweet, she also taught us about a few Japanese words (although we were already familiar with them) and we did a little cat pose together and meowed! I know it sounds silly to read but it was soooo cute and fun. I didn't feel embarrassed or anything because it's so welcoming there.

I cannot wait to go back and try some of their normal food! I originally thought it was just dessert but you could easily have dinner or lunch there!"}
{"text":"I have said it before and I will say it again. The Japanese establishments need to stop being so Japanese confusing and get some order and discipline. In short, they need to think more in terms of customers and less in regards to their complicated minds.

I dropped by today at the maid cafe location not for a show, but to pick up some pastry. The poster outside showed and listed a range of products (cheese tart, yuzu tart, etc.), but of course they do not carry those items. The maid at the counter explained I would have to go to the original location for those. She was friendly and polite, but that is confusing. Why advertise something this location does not have?
Secondly, a piece of paper on the door advises customers to go upstairs as the kitchen/booth downstairs is closed. 
Thirdly, the working hours are pure Japanese. Compare this to a Chinese business whose opening hours are typically something like this: every day from 10:00 am to 11:30 pm. Here (like so many other Japanese businesses) it went something like this:
To buy a cake (incidentally don't look to buy what we advertise outside): Mondays and Tuesday 10:30 to 2:00, Wednesdays 7:00 to 7:15 and Weekends all days except during the lunar crescendo then we will limit hours according to the will of Buddha. 
To buy a madeleine: Mondays 10:45 to 14:00 (except cold days), Tuesdays 10:00 to 12:00 and again 13:00 to 16:15. Closed Wednesday and Thursdays, etc.
Cafe: Afternoons weekdays (except Mondays and Thursdays) and Saturdays most of the afternoon and Sundays less hours than that.
I wish I had taken a photo of the, er, hours sheet on the door. 
Incidentally, it is a maid cafe with a stage show, but the show is as scarce as Donald Trump's brain power. 
Anyway, the maid at the counter was friendly and packaged my $10 original cheesecake (still no credit card, but they accept debit cards), which may be imported from the original location and was as light and fluffy as always, and told me how happy she was to work there. In all seriousness, I love hearing that because I support employers and businesses that tend to their employees.
The cafe itself was empty of course. You see, a limited assortment of baked goods for take-out only were for sale, but there was no dine-in when I was there. That follows a different operating hour than the take-out counter."}
{"text":"Went here several times, usually around the time of the second performance at 8:30pm. I noticed that they added a min purchase of $10 for 90 mins during my last visit, which is expected since I bet there was people that were camping the place for hours without ordering anything.

The desserts are great, and I've taken a liking to the White Orchard. I always order at least one every time I'm there.

They also serve specials like the omurice. I haven't tried it but I should. However I noticed that they didn't put the rice into the egg omelette which is the standard way of making the dish.

For the performance, they are known as ACT102 (pronounced ACT ten two). There are three teams. 

Team A (A stands for Artistic) is my second favourite due to one of the maids (Berry) that is helping all the other maids trying to get better at English. Their schedule seems to be Tuesday and Thursday. One of the songs that is unique to them is a Morning Musume '15 song so if you are a fan of that and are good at wotagei, please do come. Keina is also in this team and I'm taken a liking for her as well. Their image colour is Blue. However, if you are cheering for Berry, support her with some purple!

Team C (C stands for Cute). I first saw them on stage during the grand opening on May 15th and I've quickly put them on the top of the list because of their performance of READY!! from The iDOLM@STER in their medley part. RIN-CHAN SAIKYOU! Also some cheers to Minnie who designed all the maid costumes for the entire cafe! Their image colour is Pink just like iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls Cute girls. Not sure what their schedule is like though.

Team T (T stands for Trouble). Their only performance so far was during the grand opening. Since I do not know much about them yet, I'm not going to talk much about them. All I know is that they performed AKB48's Heart Gata Virus. Their image colour is Yellow

They also have two planned performances at Anime North on Friday and Saturday, so if you are going there and you have time, you should give them a visit.

The atmosphere is alright, but I am hoping that there are more people around that know the chants for the songs. So far, I've been the only one there that has been doing it. Also, when they do Koi Suru Fortune Cookie from AKB48, if you don't feel shy, you should go up on stage and dance with them! The in-store music playlist that plays when no performance is going on plays some pretty popular Japanese songs as well. During my last visit, it appears they added Shine!! from iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls to this list and I was ecstatic when it came on.

I recommend this cafe for any idol fan be it 2D or 3D. The maids are also improving and I'm hoping they get more performances in. Team C is planning to do the opening theme for Hanayamata in the future."}
{"text":"Had to try this place due to the hype on a Wednesday night 9pm. Waitresses are dressed in maid outfits and the seating is upstairs. It's a busy place so service is slow. The place has a lot of character and is very loud. There's a stage where you can take a pic to post on FB or Twitter with their logo behind you.

We were a party of 7 and shared a few things. Check the pics! I had the Yuzu lunar cheesecake hubby had the angel, my kid had the chocolate lunar. Taste was good but not mind blowing. Texture is much airier than traditional New York cheesecake so you don't feel as if you've eaten a brick. Service was decent. My Yuzu was yummy but the chocolate lunar was decadent and yummy. The angel was good too but almost like eating flavoured sponge or angel food cake. 
I think if you're used to North American cheesecake and like that density and texture, you may be disappointed. If you want to try a lighter version, then this gives you the taste of cheesecake w/o the texture or heaviness. All depends on what makes your individual taste buds glow"}
{"text":"Came here with my sister on a Saturday night. It was our first time trying uncle tetsu cakes. There was no wait and a few vacant tables. The waiters were all cosplaying in cute Japanese main costumes. The atmosphere gave a very Japanese feel. They played Japanese music. 

We ordered the tasting platter and a green tea latte. The green tea latte came with a cute design. The tasting platter came with 7 different types of cake and some matcha green tea ice cream.  My favourites were the angel cakes. My sisters favourite was the chocolate cake. 
We didn't really like the Yuzu lunar cake or the green tea lunar cake as much. They had a sour taste to them. 
The cakes were not mind blowing but some were pretty good.

The green tea ice cream was pretty good. It's a lot creamier than the ones they sell at the uncle tetsu shop.

I would probably come again for their angel cakes. It's a good place to check out if you like cake and anime or Japanese culture.

Tip: Come here and try the Japanese cheese cake instead to avoid the long line ups at the uncle tetsu shop"}
{"text":"Though I've never been to any maid cafes in Japan, I can definitely see the authenticity surrounding the cafe. For instance, the waitresses (maids) speak Japanese and replicate the polite service-oriented attitude that's very prominent in Japan. Very different from your traditional North American cafe.

Food: 4/5
-Ordered the dessert platter and split it amongst 3 people. The desserts came with 3 generous flavour syrups (matcha, strawberry, and chocolate). My favourite of the platter had to be the matcha cheesecake + soft serve and original Tetsu cheesecake -  overall these were great :). There was also a citrus cheese cake and chocolate cake which, in my opinion, were quite mediocre.

Environment/Service: 4/5
Maids were really friendly and always offered to refill our water glasses. There's also a cute little photo booth that you can pose with your friends and the maids - you can email these photos to yourself as a memento which I thought was adorable. Also, this is one of the few places where there are gender-neutral washrooms (each toilet/sink has its own separate small room) which is quite a refreshing change. 

I went here a couple of months ago and ordered a matcha parfait - definitely recommend getting this for anyone visiting soon!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't great. Everything came out at turtle speed. To be fair, our group was on the larger side and we took up two booths. But serving one thing at a time isn't very efficient. 

I ordered the...

Matcha Latte - I liked the taste of this. HOWEVER, it was barely warm when it arrived and it looked as though it had spilled as it didn't have a pretty design on it like my friend's matcha latte. 
Original Cheesecake - It was nice and as expected. Light, fluffy. We almost wanted to buy a whole one home. However, it seemed smaller than the Love Me Sweet Japanese cheesecake (which is closer in our area for the same price). 

Got to sample
Angel Hat - It was super light and got a nice strawberry taste to it. It was super small though for the price.
Matcha Ice cream - I liked how they also included graham cracker crumbs, etc. to it and not just ice cream. 

There's usually a show here on Tuesdays with the 'angel' maids where they sing/dance in their uniforms (Think Mrs. White from Clue)."}
{"text":"3 things I like and don't like

1. Very close to Eaton Centre and rest of the downtown core, just a short walk away. Easy for commuters from all corners of Toronto to get here if you're interested in checking this cafe out.

2. Unique as it is the only maid cafe in town and is a relatively new phenomenon in Canada. Whether or not it's your cup of tea is completely up to you, some people love the idea while others are not too fond of it, but it really doesn't hurt in checking it out.

3. Best desserts here in my estimation are the angel hat cheesecake and the waffle with ice cream. I haven't had a chance to try their main courses such as the Japanese curry or omurice but I hope to do so in the future. I'd give the desserts a 4/5 but I believe the overall ambience and novelty are what make it what it is."}
{"text":"We went at 3 pm on a Tuesday, so there was nobody in the cafe which was disappointing because I heard that the waitresses sing and dance. But there were not enough people in the restaurant so I guess they didn't do anything. 

I had the chocolate angel cake and it tasted kind of plain and had a consistency of mousse. My friend had the original lunar cheesecake and it tasted more cream cheesy than the normal cheesecake. The lunar cheesecake had the consistency of jello.

Overall I think the cafe was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Got the cheesecake platter or something that comes with basically every kind of cheese cake they have. I liked them alright but they were literally alright. As a japanese cheese cake from a local bakery, definitely above average, really nice texture. But as a dessert, nothing mind blowing. 
For a $5 tea, I think they can do much better than a tea bag (although I get that some tea bags are nice just not this case). 
I do not know how I feel about the maids or being served by maids. They are nice but either they are like real ppl out of animes so kinda creepy or they remind you of those girls from some other vids"}
{"text":"We got here at about 1:30pm on a Sunday and were seated right away. The restaurant is maid-theme, and their customer service was pretty good. They are very welcoming and took our orders in a timely manner. We ordered a chocolate angel cake and a regular cheesecake. I didn't think it was anything particularly special, but was good overall. I think next time, I'd like to try the savory foods that they have."}
{"text":"Adorable spot and beat the lines at the other location! Sit down and enjoy a variety of slices* or angel hat cake like we did.. take two to go cause they're light fluffy and not too sweet!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of the original Uncle Tetsu pop-up location in Toronto, my boyfriend & I were really disappointed of how our experience went after visiting Angel Cafe for a dessert run the other day. 

On the first part of our visit, we ordered two Strawberry Angel cheesecake; alongside with the Matcha latte and Yuzu mousse and were quite satisfied. The atmosphere was refreshing, as if you were in a cafe located in Japan and the servers (all dressed in maid and host outfits) were accommodating for the most part, except when they started coming back to our table, disrupting our conversation over and over again asking if we want to order more or if we wanted more water.

We only discovered about the show time that day from multiple hosts and decided to come back in an hour after notifying one of the maids/hosts of our subsequent return. Later on in the evening, we decided to come back again to watch the performances as the servers invited us and right when we walked in; they insisted to have us seated despite us telling them beforehand that we are not there to order more as we had just came about an hour ago. Prior to being seated, we planned on simply watching from afar leaning on the walls not trying to take up a seat. Initially, we thought that they were just trying to be really accommodating to their customers, but when we were about to walk out after the performances ended, the \"MC\" or as someone we presumed as the café's manager called us out for apparently \"taking up space\" for the other customers as he saw that we did not order any more. We tried to explain to him our situation and how prior to us coming to see the performance, we had already ordered and payed. However, instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding, he still insisted on the fact that we did not order from the cafe and that he was under the impression that we were to just watch the show without having ordered at all; causing us to just walk out abruptly. 

I have never been to a restaurant or a cafe who treated me like that before. I have found it extremely rude and patronizing to be confronted like that in front of a crowd of people, especially by someone who was acknowledged as the host of the show prior to this altercation. I would have given this review a 4 because of the food but I would not recommend it to anyone as the management and customer service is really poor. 

As for that manager who called us out; I am not sure where you had your education but please go back to school and relearn management, customer service and even an intro to marketing again because that is NOT how you treat your customers. If there is something not working out in your cafe, you do not blame the people buying and sitting in your cafe, but speak to your staff members to fix the problems that you see. Regardless of whether individuals would like to view your show without ordering, the manager should never have to call out an audience member. Those audience members could potentially bring up a returns for the stores in forms such as buzz via word of mouth, social media exposure, and a positive review on sites such as this. If that MC or management team is reading this, I hope you take this to heart and make adjustments with how you treat customers and how you control your flows of communication within your staff."}
{"text":"I've had a few matcha lattes here and overall I really enjoy the good food and excellent service here. It's pretty unique. You know about the maid costumes and the dancing. You can actually go on stage and dance as well as part of the show. I did not but there was a bachelor party there and the groom did. The dancing is ok, the music is fun. You can take pics with the maids or uncle tetsu if he's there. 

Matcha latte: very good, comes with a bear image on top but you can ask for other things like a cat.

Yuzu lunar cheesecake: sweeter than the angel hats, and more like a traditional cheesecake. The yuzu flavour is apparent and the presentation is well done.

Strawberry angel hat: pretty fluffy and tasty. Not too filling so good for dessert.

Overall, I can't see much wrong with having a unique experience and pretty good food and drinks. The more the better."}
{"text":"You will find a fun and unique concept here. I came across this place as a hot new business before arriving in Toronto. It turns out there are several other businesses of this sort in Toronto operating under a similar name. 

The kawaii waitresses were friendly in seating and waiting on us, the atmosphere was lively and we were pleasantly surprised with the live performance by the waitstaff. In a bit of a modest ordering style we settled in ordering one item--the matcha parfait. 

The parfait was definitely worth trying because of the numerous toppings of matcha cheesecake, matcha ice cream, matcha pudding, cornflakes and whipped cream. Adding additional items to there menu will only supplement what appeared to be interesting yet limited menu. I'm sure this cafe will flourish once word gets out on their opening!"}
{"text":"3.5 decent place to hangout with friends. Expect to pay a premium for a slice of cake as opposed to just buying one to go. I tried the matcha angel one and it was delicious! The decor is nothing fancy but there are a decent amount of seating. I think they also have karaoke nights."}
{"text":"Currently here with two of my girl friends, and ordered matcha soft serve(really delicious, with strong matcha flavour) and a vanilla bean tea latte. At first I thought that the vanilla bean latte was made with espresso, but later learned that it was made with tea. Even with the mix up, I still enjoyed the tea latte and glad that I was able to try it. Such a cute place with servers dressed as maids, still not sure wether I like that concept or not, but over all the experience was great and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsu's cakes are good, but half the reason why they're good is because they're inexpensive. With that logic, paying $6-7 for a slice of the full $10 cake is just silly but we had already decided to come and experience the maid café. We got the matcha latte to try as well as the no bake cheesecake. The lattes were alright, but the no bake cheesecake was basically gelatin. 

To be honest, the maid aspect of this cafe kind of creeped me out. There's just something about the wall of photos of their 5ft nothing maids, the actual maids themselves having such high pithced voices or the man we observed strongly coming onto one of them that rubs me the wrong way. 

Would come back just to get the cake to go."}
{"text":"I went to Uncle Tetsu's like an hour ago and the sign said wait to be seat so we wait till host seated us and she gave us menu after 15 mins past by no one come to take order so we left and I saw 3 waiters walked around no one come to ask or take order. I really want to try their cheesecake but at the first time visited I feel really disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very cute maid/servers. But the maid would take forever to come back to our table to bring food, take our order, bring us utensils, bring the bill. Visit took around 2 hours because they were so slow. The food was delicious though and I might come back again."}
{"text":"I always want to try the Angel's hat cake!!!! So good! Love the classic matcha green tea cheesecake"}
{"text":"I finally got to come here with four other of my internet friends. 

This place. Is. SO. CUTE. 

The maids are just adorable, and the butler is super cute too! I had the curry rice, and the others had omruce, curry rice and udon. We did a cute little spell to make our food taste better. 

We also ordered a parfait. Matcha! The entire atmosphere is fabulous. I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe with Japanese waitresses dressed up in maid outfits. We ordered and ask the waitresses for some clarification on the menu. She right away went all the way down to her knees to try to explain it to us with her broken English and also staring at us with those big doe eyes. I guess this is the Japanese cutesy school girl demeanour they are portraying... But it was just a bit too awkward for me. Anyways don't expect the waitresses to have very good English but they were always really polite and kept coming by to check if we are okay. 

I ordered the matcha parfait and it was just perfection. Although steeper in price compared to the other options at $12.50. It comes with matcha cheese cake, which is mellow moist, creamy and perfectly melds with the soft serve ice cream and pudding. To top it off they have some matcha syrup, red bean paste and bits of corn flakes for the texture. Much better than the parfait/sundaes I had from Woofles and Cream or Tsujiri down the road. 

My friend had the angel cake which was probably about a quarter of a whole cake for ~7 bucks. So I would recommend to just get the whole cake takeout for the value at $10.

Overall it is a nice spot and usually can find seats even on a Friday. Also if you're just going for green tea soft serve you can check it out here for about the same price as Tsujiri but will find seating."}
{"text":"This place is really fun and the service is a bit slow due to the amount of people. Though it is slow the waitresses are very polite and nice. The food is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friends for dessert.  Very comfortable atmosphere  where the service is quick and the servers use a  electronic note pad to take orders.  We  ate some lunar cheesecake as well as ordered some to go  . The cheesecakes were that good .   There were other  menu items  but we settled for cheesecake. I got a  a yuzu  lunar cheesecake , and we  also ordered  chocolate & original  lunar cheesecake to go .  We will be back to try more menu items  and  attend one of their shows.  
My recommendations: are yuzu , chocolate  lunar cheesecakes , the matcha mousse .  Savour every bite and they are worth the price . Try them   :)"}
{"text":"Cute cafe! Service was great, cheesecake was amazing, and the drinks were pretty good too! Some of their food isn't the best, but it's definitely still worth trying out for the fun and cute environment."}
{"text":"Wish I knew about the maids and the show in the cafe, which I would have probably stayed for. On the other hand, we just got the cheesecake as a quick to-go since we were in line for the popular ramen place down street. Luckily for us, they came pipping hot out of the oven, ready to be bought.

I kind of got the hype of this place. The one huge appeal was that it come out jiggly and hot. As I dug in, it really did just melt in my mouth. It was light and buttery, with a hint of cheese. The one thing that really hit the spot was how it was really like eating clouds because it was so light and fluffy. 

However, while it was pretty good, I got over it in a few bites. I can probably eat about 1/4 of it and then eat something else. If I had to wait an hour or two in line, I might pass, but no wait? Yes, I'll take a box please!"}
{"text":"Come to this location and you can get your take-out Original Uncle Tetsu Cheese cake a lot faster (~2-10 min wait) than the main location on Bay Street. It's super reasonable too at $10/cake.

It's consistently, fluffy, light and so creamy. Literally cheese cake clouds that melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Uncle Tetsus is great ! It has a very cute atmosphere with pink wall paint, fluffy cheesecake and the servers dress as French maids. It is a good place to go with a group of friends and to share items from the menu. The menu offers sweet and savoury items. We tried the fried chicken pieces, croquettes and the famous cheesecake. All very good !"}
{"text":"I ordered the matcha tea waffle.  It was delicious, except Id share it with someone next time.  The portion is meant for two people."}
