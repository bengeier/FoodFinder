{"text":"Best place in the Southside to watch a Steelers game. Hands down. Great specials, great bar food (try the Titan Toothpicks), great service, great crowd. You'll get celebratory hugs and high-fives from everyone around you for every great play and I wouldn't have it any other way. Go for the game, come back for the experience."}
{"text":"Went here with friends to grab a few drinks.  The it was early and not that packed but grew as the night went on.  Pretty soon it was packed but service was good even with crowd and the prices were reasonable and they have a pretty good draft list.  A good place to get your drink on with a crowd of rowdy friends."}
{"text":"Went here with the wife after not wanting to wait for a table at Fatheads.  We had no real clue where we were gonna end since this was our first visit to ketchup city.  We just walked up Carson St and came upon this joint.  The Penguins game was on and seemed that most everyone in there was there to watch the Pens.  Too bad they lost to the machine that is Boston this year.  I was quietly enjoying watching the ass-kicking since I'm a Caps fan.  But I kept my glee to myself not wanting to start any trouble.  One cool thing this place did was offer a drink special every time the Pens scored a goal.  Unfortunately, they only scored one goal while we were there (i.e. 2nd period on).  We didn't partake in the shooter special since we both haven't been the age where shooters were a viable drink option in a long while.    We added to our already existing buzz from our earlier bar patronage over in the strip area by downing some Yeunglings.  We also ate some food.  I had a burger and the wife a fish sandwich.  The burger was decent and the wife's sandwich was huge....you could of made three sandwiches from the piece of fried cod/haddock they gave her.  Jesus, it was a HUGE piece of fried fish.  We took nearly 2/3 of it back to the hotel with us.    This place seemed like a typical young urban professional's type of place.  It was somewhat aesthetic being an historic landmark and all but the upstairs (where we ended up b/c the downstairs was packed) was nothing special.  I actually felt like I was in some buddy's poorly built rec room minus the bathroom.  The TV and sound system up there was nice though.  They also had a large projection screen on the bottom level that had a decent picture.  We only stayed for 2 periods of hockey.  Enough to drink a few beers and eat some grub.  We weren't feeling the place all that much.  It wasn't our style.  It was definitely a place for younger folks looking to get some bar grub and grab a buzz.  There wasn't in much of atmosphere or style to the people in the joint. or to the joint itself.  Just your average bar.   It would be a decent place to go out with your buddies or girlfriends if that's the kind of thing you're into.  You could probably find some drunk bootie in the place late at night....again, if that's the kind of thing you're into."}
{"text":"My experience at Carson City Saloon was great and I will definitely be back again. I was there on a Sunday during a Steeler's game and that was an experience in itself. It is a bar with two floors and an outside/roof seating area as well. Every time the Steelers scored the waitress asked us if we wanted to take a $1.50 cherry bomb shot. Of course, we obliged and the shots were pretty good for being so inexpensive! We got two appetizers: the buffalo chicken wing dip and the pulled pork nachos. Honestly, I still dream about the nachos.....they were AMAZING. They were topped with the best pulled pork I've ever had and I will definitely be back for more. The buffalo chicken wing dip was also delicious and they served it warm. There was a ton of dip and too much for me and my friend to finish! Our waitress was also great! She was super friendly, attentive, and she was the one who recommended the two appetizers we had. Yum :) I would highly recommend Carson City for a game day destination and I plan to make It my go-to bar for Steelers games next season!"}
{"text":"Only three stars for the \"#1 Sports Bar in Pittsburgh\"?  Geez, how bad are the rest of them?  I actually had a rather lovely time at this bar on a Friday afternoon, where the only patrons were myself, a childhood friend (who randomly accosted me inside the bar), and his coworkers.  This place is kind of obscenely huge, and I can't imagine how they manage to serve everyone in there drinks from one bar when it gets packed, but I guess that's not my problem.    I initially wandered in for some lunch, and saw that there was nothing even remotely healthy/low-fat on the menu, so I decided to forgo the portobello sandwich and succumb to one of those lovely \"salads\" that I only find in Pittsburgh, that are covered with meat, cheese, and french fries.  More fat than vegetable, but whatever. I accompanied this with a Jameson cocktail because, well, why not?  Two more of those bad boys (OMG, I just referred to a drink as a \"bad boy\", please shoot me) and I was feeling kind of hammered.  Maybe because there are at least 2 shots in each cocktail.  Annnnnyway, I jetted right before the after work crowd started heating up.  Lots of um......er......healthy looking ladies in there.  Oh, wait!  They have Lambic on tap!  How cool is that!  That's cool!  I am not nearly drunk enough!  I'm going to go drink until I find my reviews entertaining again!"}
{"text":"The best place in the city to watch the Pens game, hands down.    It's a large bar, with 2 floors in the main bar, and a beer pong room in the basement.  The whole thing used to be a bank and so you get a really interesting feel.    The crowd is rowdy and loud...this isn't a place for a first date.  But who am I kidding, you're coming here for the game.  The drink specials for Penguins and Steelers games are awesome....first score, domestic drafts are the number of CENTS as the player's number.  If Sidney Crosby scores, you pay 87 cents for a beer.  Pretty nice.  It progresses to 1.50 bombs, and so forth.  It really adds a whole new level of fun to the games!  Food here is decent bar food, nothing to write home about.  It's a nice compliment to the beer, but you won't find too many healthy options for sure.  Service is really good, especially considering the size of the place.  It has consistently impressed me 6+ times, so I feel confident that it is always good.   Prices are average for South Side, so 2.50-4.00 beers and most entrees below 12 bucks.  Overall, come here to watch the game at a bar where everyone is having a blast and enjoying the game with you.  Or stick around and party...it's a pretty rocking place!"}
{"text":"This is oddly enough an appetizer review! We went here last night for the Biggies Bullies fundraiser, and it was our first time at Carson City. It was crowded downstairs, and kind of overwhelming between the people everywhere and the noise. We went up to the rooftop and it was so much more quiet, and there were TVs, tables and a bar up there so it was perfect. Since we donated to the fundraiser we got $3 off all appetizers, and thank god for that. $8 for a chicken finger app? Um, sorry but no. We wanted the buffalo chicken dip and loaded fries, but the broiler was broken so we couldn't get either. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, pierogies, and chicken quesadillas. The spinach and artichoke dip was meh, and the chips were MEGA salty. Unenjoyably so, and it was a huge portion for an appetizer. So you're getting your money's worth, anyway. The pierogies were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, came with sour cream and very good. There were 6 in our order. The quesadillas would make an entire meal for one, it was again a huge portion for an appetizer. They were packed with chicken, cheese and bell peppers, and came with more cheese, delicious salsa, sour cream and lettuce to put on top. They were really good. We didn't try the dinner menu since we were trying to save some money and it was a bit pricey, but 2 of our 3 appetizers were good. Out waitress was attentive and was able to put our drinks and food on different tabs with no problem.  Overall, head for the rooftop, which is covered and heated in winter, and much quieter than the scene downstairs in the evening."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 0 stars. I liked this bar at first but then I left my purse at the rooftop and the bar would not let me back in to go get it because I didn't have my ID. Which is totally reasonable, but I asked them for an escort to bring me up to go find it with me. The employee was so incredibly rude I couldn't believe it. He called me names, he said I \"didn't belong\", he asked me to walk in traffic. The manager was all about backing up his employee and did not apologize once. The manager said there is no way the employee said those things and that he is too \"calm\" to act that way. It was the most ridiculous experience ive have to deal with since being in Pittsburgh. I regret ever going here and giving them my business. If you go here make sure you don't make any errors because they will treat you like complete shit. We will never be going here again."}
{"text":"By far my absolute favorite bar in Pittsburgh! It's such a hip, young bar where everyone is having a blast. Its totally my scene. The \"frat boys\" you were referencing below are people in collared shirts. Last time I checked, Its okay to go out and look nice, guys. Girls like it when you arent dressed in cargo shorts and a crappy t-shirt. Hellooooo!Haha lots of good looking guys and girls singing and drinking is what I saw. Loved the music and the vibe.  The drink prices are AMAZING especially coming from LA, I recognize a fun,Pittsburgh bar when I see it.  I love the architecture of the building too. My perfect night out involves Carson City in the South Side. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review based on my dining experience here. The service was great and our waitress was very attentive. The menu was straightforward and the food came out in a timely manner. Overall, the food was just average though. Portion size was a bit too small for the price. I got the Parmesan crusted chicken wrap with a side of Parmesan fries. The wrap was smaller than my hand, and I have small hands. The wrap was just a typical chicken wrap smothered in mayo. The fries claimed to be tossed in some garlic parm mix, but tasted like it was tossed in plain salt to me. The fries were crispy though, which I like. My meal came out to be over $10 and it was just meh.   Considering the fact that I was in Southside and there are plenty of better dinning options around for the same price, I probably will not go out of my way to get food here. There's Fatheads and the Library a few blocks down."}
{"text":"Standard Pittsburgh \"sports bar\". Food is decent, if unspectacular. Pens game drink specials are good."}
{"text":"I came to Carson for the $1 beers which is advertised as 10-12. However when I ordered a drink at 10:15 I was informed that the special did not start until the pens game was over.  Dissatisfied overall"}
{"text":"By far the best bar in Pittsburgh! Atmosphere is like nothing else, great food for lunch and dinner, great drink specials, and the best staff in the Burgh! You want a taste of Pittsburgh, THIS is what it is all about and doesn't get any better then this! A+++"}
{"text":"Loved this bar and had come here after kickball games at Armstrong field for a couple of weeks. Last night, we went with our team in t-shirts and shorts/yoga pants for a couple of drinks around 7 PM. We were there for several hours and left around 11. Immediately after exiting, my fiancée realized she left her purse and turned back around to go get it. The bouncer would not allow her re-entry without her ID, but we explained that her ID was in her purse. He told us, \"There's no way we would have ever let you in with what you were wearing.\" and continued to say there is nothing he can do to help us get her purse inside. We refused to leave, so he finally called the manager who escorted her inside and she found her purse immediately. We expressed our frustration with this situation to the manager who defended his bouncer and would not apologize. I'm not sure why the bouncer couldn't have just called the manager to escort us from the get-go rather than arguing with us. I also get the fact that there's a dress code, but we were welcomed to be there several weeks in a row in the same attire. We'll be taking our business elsewhere after our games from now on. Super bummed, cause we actually really liked this bar and they're pretty reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Hit up Carson City on our fried Pickle tour.  (My boyfriend and I go around town eating fried pickles and ranking them..List to follow upon completion).  It was a Steeler Saturday, but we ended up getting a seat at the bar because we were early before the game.  Fried pickles were a 4/5.  We really dig the chips, not spears.  Service was good, as we showed up at shift change.  The bartender called me \"honey\", which I thought was endearing and comical at the same time."}
{"text":"Bar review, no food. Carson City Saloon is a decent-sized bar with plenty of seating and TVs. Enjoyed a glass of Double Chocolate Stout while watching the Home Run Derby, chatting with a baseball fan on my left and attempting to ignore the two annoying 20-something-year-old girls, whining about \"boys\" to my right. Overall okay spot to have a drink and watch sports."}
{"text":"I have experienced Carson City throughout the years as they continue to be a staple Carson Street destination throughout the year for all kinds of occasions. Steeler and Penguins games, summer day time bar crawls, Friday night shenanigans, and New Years Eve parties. I've seen them reinvent themselves with the opening of their rooftop level making it a continued enjoyable experience to come.  The first floor is your basic Southside location, half way between a sports bar, a restaurant and a push-fest crowding yourself to get to the inconveniently small bar. The space on the general floor is large enough to hold a group drinking party whether fundraising post-gaming or as part of the Santa Clause crawl. This is also the only level you the full menu, make sure to try the dips, the buffalo chicken is constantly good. Even with the craft beer explosion here in the city, this is primarily a liquor bar, at least on level 1.  the second level has a small balcony veranda and minimal floor space, usually there will be shot girls tasked to get you to participate in a liquor promotion, some free versions, some not. There's not much to see at this level.  The roof-top bar has been there for a few years now and by far an awesome addition to the Bar. This level is mainly a Beer level and gives you a vibe of a never ending college Spring Break no matter at what age. Grab a few snacks and appetizers while you grab a can of miller lite or an alcoholic slushy [those are fantastic - 2 flavors, 2 liquors types] and during some Saturday afternoon engage in a game of cornhole flashing oversized designer sunglasses over your abercrombie and fitch fashion tanks. I was there this Saturday during the Mustache March and the Kentucky derby. The slushies were the highlight of the night and the Bartender were fantastic [even if I almost scared her to death as a penny jumped out at me from my purse and i mistook it for a large bug]  Always chill always great for getting your first neck-sunburn of the year. Do come often."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place!!! The employees are very rude and ignorant, they will treat you with total disrespect and the management is even worse. The food is not good at all and the drinks are watered down, not to mention over priced. The atmosphere is much like a frat house and the employees are so unprofessional. Save your money and go somewhere else, there are much better bars in Pittsburgh to visit. Don't make the same mistake we made by walking in to the establishment because you will certainly regret it."}
{"text":"Hmmmmm were we here on an off night? Or is Carson City a completely different bar now?!  I was in town for the weekend, and I wanted to do a mini crawl with some college friends, and this was our first stop. When I was in college, 2008-2010, this was my favorite bar to come, watch sports, and drink on the weekends. It would always be PACKED. This was before the rooftop bar opened.  We came in, and it was so empty. The tables on the left side were all empty (I'm sure the kitchen was closed by then anyway). They had taken down the half wall that separated the restaurant side from the bar side, so it was all one room downstairs now. So downstairs was almost empty, with just a handful of people at the bar. The 2nd floor was completely empty, and we made our way to the new rooftop bar, where most of the crowd was, but it still wasn't crowded! I was so upset to see it so empty. This place used to seriously be the best. I had to use the bathroom once, and I don't think I've ever seen the women's room without a line, let alone me being the only person in there. It was so strange! There also used to be a beer pong room in the basement that would fill up with people, but all the rooms were closed, so I dunno if it even still exists...  Anyway, my friends and I all got one drink and decided to move on to the next place. I hope this was just an off night, or we were there a little too early, cause if Carson City is this lame now, I'll be sad!"}
{"text":"Carson City Saloon is just ohhhh-kaaaay.  Admittedly, I've only ever ordered lunch to go from here and while the service is usually friendly, the sandwiches and wraps I've had have always been rather bland. My most recent experience was a take-out order for the Veggie Wrap, which consisted of a somewhat soggy mixture of grilled vegetables (red peppers, eggplant, mushrooms - all ingredients I normally love), tomato, lettuce, provolone, and dressing. It seemed that the ratio of dressing to everything else was disproportionate (in favor of the dressing), hence why everything was a bit... soggy. Oddly enough, with so much dressing you'd think there would be a wealth of flavor, but still SOMEHOW, some way, it was still uber bland.  While I'm not really a sports-bar-kind-of-gal, \"The Saloon\" seems like it might be better at night for big groups, yelling, and lots of ESPN action - preferably under the influence of a few rounds."}
{"text":"My experiences at Carson City Saloon have always been great. The main reason why is that the owners are awesome. These guys know how to run a good bar/restaurant. They have awesome specials that cater to everyone. Who doesn't want a 32 oz Yuengling for $1 on Wednedsay? Who isn't in for a Blue Moon Yard for $1 on Tuesday? Happy Hours from 5-7 with $2 you call it drafts(they have plenty), and 5$ appetizers. On Wednesdays they have a live band(Walk of Shame). These guys play all songs that you know. Their wings are awesome. I think they're .45 on Mondays. There are specials for all of your local sports teams games. Many TV's. A huge projection TV. Perfect sound on for the big game. They have a roof top deck which is so nice once the weather breaks. They have a party room I believe you can rent in the downstairs with a beer pong table and its on little private bar. I have been there for birthday parties before. The Jayson burger gets 2 thumbs up. It was cooked perfectly to my liking and seasoned to perfection. For a sports bar, this place is as good as it gets. It gets busy during the nights, slower during the daytime. I have always loved doing some day drinking at this place on the weekend. They've had my business from the beginning and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"This review is based on both the atmosphere and the food.  I have been going to this bar for the last ten years and have a lot of great memories here.  With the addition of the rooftop, it is spacious enough that it usually is not too jam packed.  However, some nights it being crowded is what makes it so fun.  It is the best place in the city to watch a penguins game.  Playoff games here are amazing.    In terms of the food, it is better than you would expect for s place like this that is more of a bar than place to eat.  My usual go to is the buffalo chicken hoagie or the wings.  They also have some great house made ranch.  If my review were based only on food it would probably be a 3, but everything else this place offers bumps it up."}
{"text":"This place makes me nauseous. Fairly rude staff, half the bouncers think they're in the secret service, usually really slow, and will let other customers get away with murder if they're friends with an employee. $1 32oz Yuengling drafts is one of their claims-to-fame, however typically 14 of those ounces are foam. Rooftop deck makes this a two-star."}
{"text":"Flew in from Vegas and needed a fun bar to watch the game at. After a few bars we didn't care for too much, we found the Carson City Saloon. This place used to be a bank so I was really fascinated by the vault that I saw as soon as I walked in.The atmosphere was fun, and energetic but the place does get crowded quickly. The bartenders were quick, friendly and professional. We had a Steak Salad which was absolutely delicious. The \"smoke\" didn't realy bother me, it wasn't too bad (or maybe I'm used to it since all bars in Vegas are smoking). We liked this bar so much we even returned the next day (and ate a steak salad yet again.)  There really is nothing bad to say about this bar. Good food, fun atmosphere, friendly bartenders and awesome drink specials. Will definitely return next time I visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Carson City Saloon is a spacious, divey sports bar with multiple levels and televisions, as well as a large projection screen for sporting events and a rooftop bar that is great during nice weather.  The food here is not good and should only be eaten in emergencies such as starvation and extreme intoxication.  Despite the very reasonable prices, the execution of the menu items aren't worth what you pay for them.  Like I said, it's only good for keeping you from getting sick while you're pounding drinks.  On the other hand, the service is excellent and attentive.  I was there during a Stanley Cup Finals game, and although there were only a few servers on the floor, they were doing an excellent job keeping up with the crowd's demands, maintaining tabs and remaining upbeat the entire time.  As for the ambiance, the music gets a little loud when they aren't piping in the game's audio, the smoking gets heavy, the crowds get thick and the nightclub vibe is in full effect as the evening draws on.  My opinion is that this is a divey club disguised as a sports bar that has plenty of floor space for watching games, but ultimately caters to a younger crowd.  If you decide to watch the game there, do yourself a favor and eat somewhere beforehand, then get ready to get rowdy!"}
{"text":"This remains my absolute favorite bar in South Side. Whether I'm heading out for lunch, or a few drinks, I'm always happy here! The burgers are just delicious. The salads are nice and large. The prices are very reasonable. The waitstaff is amazing! They turned an old bank into a bar. No matter how many times I come here, I can't help but be amused to see the vault doors in the back of the dining area."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere and location. The bar itself is fine for a bar in the South Side. The food is just ok. Nothing amazing, nothing terrible. The wings are the standout. A great hangout, but not your best option for food in the South Side."}
{"text":"I stopped down for Monday wing night and was very impressed. It wasn't too crowded and all the \"bros\" that people are talking about were downstairs so we chose to sit on the second floor. Since there was no Pittsburgh game going on everything was fairly calm and smooth.   Two soft drinks and 20 wings and the bill was under $12. Not bad! Not too mention the service was great and friendly. The wings were good and they had at least 30 different sauces. Some of the wings were a little small and didn't have much meat, but for $0.35 you can't complain.   The only complaint I had was there was only one smaller TV upstairs. It wasn't an issue, but the person I was dining with wanted to watch  the football game and because of the size it was a little hard for him to see. There are a lot of TVs downstairs, including big projection screens, but are hard to see from above."}
{"text":"I went in with a friend, it was the first business I entered, ever, in Pittsburgh.  An hour or two later, a friend of hers came in and wondered aloud what we were doing there, that the place sucked.  Well, coming from NY it didn't suck at all.  I first snickered at what I thought were a long row of frat boys sitting at the bar in striped polos and sneakers and cargo shorts; I like them a lot better after realizing they were 40-something latino dudes.  But they looked just like frat boys from the back!  So tricky. Our waitress was very cute and attentive, I remember remarking how I thought she was the best waitron I'd had in a while. My Yeunglings were like two bucks, and my friend's Blue Moons were $4 and change, which I learned later is somewhat expensive in Pittsburgh.  No mind.  I got wings, they were good.  They had tvs with a bunch of games.  I like sports bars, and this place was alright."}
{"text":"Usually crowded, So get the balcony. Puke on someone's head."}
{"text":"Someone named Marissa was outside giving away $3 off $5 which was a great incentive for buying something here, especially when coupled with happy hour.   I got their smothered fries and was surprised that their portion sizes were so small! However, it not was not a huge deal since I was mostly focused on their drinks. I was really excited to try their jello shots and it was delicious but didn't phase me at all, despite me being a lightweight. I wouldn't get a jello shot here if your goal here is to get sloppy."}
{"text":"First experience here. This is a place for young 20 year olds. It's been years since I did this type of scene. We went out for our daughters 21st Birthday.  Bottom floor is nice a cool and cozy until it gets packed. That's when it's difficult to move around.  The roof bar you have to get their early else it's a line to get upstairs. When you arrive it's hot and packed. It could be more like Sienna Mercatto.  Nice experience."}
{"text":"My favorite oldest son and I had a date night last night and decided to try the Saloon. When we walked in we were the only diners but there were a few people at the bar. The menu was appetizers, sandwiches, salads, and burgers. We ordered loaded fries to start.  They came to our table hot and cheesy. They did not disappoint. They came with a ranch dressing that tasted homemade.  I ordered a chicken wrap switch homemade chips. The chips were very thin and crispy. I was not thrilled with my wrap. The chicken had a weird texture and there was about a half an onion on my wrap. It was overwhelming. Even after I pulled out all of the onion you could still taste it. I only are half.  My son had a burger. It wasn't what he thought it was going to be but said it was \"ok\". He ordered a side salad with his burger which was a typical side salad.  It was all typical bar food. Nothing stood out or was memorable. You won't leave hungry but you won't rush back."}
{"text":"This place is huge! I really wish it was non-smoking since I always smell terrible afterwards. Super cheap drinks during certain hours which is a plus. Food is only okay, but hey it's a bar mainly."}
{"text":"Fun place to watch the Steelers with a group of friends.  Over 20 beers on tap and specials during the game. Beer prices are reasonable, especially the special.  Able to hear the game and also talk with you friends.  Yes it was crowded, but we got there early to get a couple of tables on the balcony.    Sampled many of the apps, fried pickles, chicken fingers with buffalo dip and others.   The apps were OK...bar food.  It is a smoking establishment, that is not fun but few smokers but why don't the waitresses empty the ashtrays!!!!!!!!  Actually the service was pretty good for a crowded game day.  But empty the ashtrays when the smokers leave!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. The service is ok, but the food can be pretty bad."}
{"text":"i don't really have anything special to say about this place other than the atmosphere and the dinner i got. upon arriving, we were seating and took pretty long to get served compared to how few people were there at the time. but i can say the service at the bar was a lot better than the service at the table. the prices were about average and there wasn't much exciting going on the entire night. however, here's where the place stood out to me: the building itself is really cool, looks super fancy from outside, and inside it has high ceilings and a classy atmosphere. and the dinner i got was fantastic. i had the \"hangover wrap\" with steak, jalepenos AND jalepeno poppers, banana peppers, cheese, and some kind of sauce. it was delicious, as were the fries that came with it. also, they seem to have some pretty good deals sometimes. i had actually come to work a promotion where customers were asked to donate $10 for free miller light drafts from 6-8."}
{"text":"Another day, another happy hour!   Let's be honest, I like cheap drinks.  Really, who doesn't?  I ordered a delish Raspberry Hoegaarden which came in a HUGE and very heavy goblet.  I really kept thinking of what excuses I would make when I accidentally dropped it.  Which, if you know me, it wouldn't surprise you.  Thankfully it didn't come to that and I decided it was my new pimp cup!   We also ordered some Buffalo Chicken Dip. If anyone knows anyone who's been to a house party, you know that's a big prerequisite.  This dip left a lot to be desired.  We kept trying to figure out what the weird taste was.  My friend was convinced it was spaghetti sauce.  That is like the ultimate sin to Buffalo dip! It was then that it became clear to me why this is still a smoking bar...   Food sucks, so this is why it's still a smoking bar.  This brings me to that one super duper big negative in my book.   I wish they'd just make all bars in the burgh nonsmoking.  I hate coming home smelling like I personally smoked a pack..  Just thinking of it grosses me out!   When my check came and it was in still in the single dollar range I was a very happy girl!  The service was good and the atmosphere is actually pretty cool.  It used to be a bank so it looks tiny from the front but it's actually a lot bigger once you're inside.  On the South Side you've really got to work hard to make your spot a destination in the plethora of other bars.  I say, so so...."}
{"text":"Love their fried pickles, Parmesan fries and pierogie stack sandwich! Staff is friendly and a great bar to watch sports."}
{"text":"The bar itself is great, but this is probably not the right place to go to just for lunch or dinner. I had the BBQ bacon burger and it was pretty good, but it is all bar food so options are limited. That being said, I still recommend Caron City to watch the games. The ambiance is good, and the crowd is generally friendly. Service is not consistent, but that is to be expected at a bar."}
{"text":"I stopped in this place yesterday on a rainy Saturday afternoon with Matt and Rob.  I always forget about this place, which is a shame because it's worth a visit especially to find a decent bar with good plasmas' and always a seat at the bar.  It's located across from Starbucks on E. Carson St.  It's a converted bank that has tall ceilings, private room downstairs and plenty of seating and a marble bar on the main floor.  The vault still exists in this converted bank, however now it's a handicapped restroom.  The regular restrooms are in the basement, which is a bit inconvenient.  The restrooms only had the hot air machines and no papertowels.  I don't know anyone who prefers this option.  I started with the chili.  THe bartender, Brian said he made it himself.  It was very good with lots of flavor, fresh seasonings, big chunks of beef and well cooked kidney beans.  My only complaint is that it was served only luke warm.  I also ordered the steak quesadilla.  It was a healthy portion of only mildly flavorful steak umm type meat and plenty of cheese.  It was a little below average, but it's not like I'm at an authentic tex mex place.  Rob ordered the \"Fried Bologna\" sandwich, which I give kudos to this place for just having such an item on the menu.  I tried it and was pretty impressed.  It was my first fried bologna sandwich.  They served it with a fried egg and a few juicy slices of tomatoes.  Matt ordered the chicken fingers and fries.  The chicken fingers were what you'd expect, but the fries were well above average I'd guess cut fresh daily and double fried.  My favorite aspect of my time spent here yesterday was one of the better top shelf long island iced teas I've had in this city.  Brian is a true pro and made a strong and delicious cocktail.  The prices are fair here and if you are looking for an alternative to the 45 min. typical wait that you'll have at Fatheads you could do a lot worse than this place."}
{"text":"Carson City Saloon exemplifies the average bar scene on Carson.  It's crowded, it's noisy, and drink prices are fair.   However, Carson City offers decent food and really personable service.  I prefer to go here on a weekday to avoid the weekend/game day crowds.  They recently opened their rooftop porch/bar, which is a really nice place to sit in the warmer months, provided you want to walk the four flights up. I'm not motivationally dispossessed at all...  Just a note, I've noticed Penn State fans tend to gather here for football games. So stay away you root for Ohio State."}
