{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time and had a mixed experience.  The decor was nice and made a decent impression initially. The salad was okay, as were the bread sticks. I ordered the asiago chicken which would have been tasty, but was under done. The waiter and the management handled the situation well and I was able to get the baked penne instead. The penne was better, ending the dinner on a better note. Overall, a decent experience."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast omlets made to order right in front of you.  Great place on the Tallmadge circle"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch a few days ago with my sister and I must say I was very impressed. The service was great and the food was delicious! I will definitely be back here soon."}
{"text":"Place has hit bottom in less than a year.  Visited there last night.  Salad bar depleted and what was there was old.  Nobody attending pasta bar.  Server did not have a clue about how food was prepared and could not answer basic questions about menu.  One of our companions sent food back because it was not ordered and no follow up.  Just terrible experience."}
{"text":"Great Service! Had the best most polite waiter. Food was great! Kids liked it too! Just an all around great experience. We went there for an early dinner on a Saturday Night. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit..  Wasn't super impressed the first time but that was early after the opened so decided to give it another try.  Unfortunately I'm still not real impressed.   We ordered a variety of dishes with our party of 5.    The positives: the portions were huge; the calzone was huge and the kids loved it; the Alfredo was good but nothing to write home about; the steak was huge and cooked as ordered  The negative: the bread that came the dipping oil was dry; the lobster ravioli was mushy and bland; the service was slow (but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt because he was new).     Overall it was a mediocre meal.  Not sure I'll be giving them a 3rd try."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out a few weeks ago. The food was pretty good but the portions were enormous. We took almost all of our food home because we were stuffed! Salad/pasta bar looked great but we passed bc we wanted to eat our actual meals. Server was pretty decent. He didn't know much about the menu or specials but was entertaining. Prices are very reasonable! Nice local restaurant"}
{"text":"Average at best. I'm a pretty normal size guy why could I not reach the back row of the salad bar at all. I dropped most of the topping on the table before I could make them to my plate. I got the chicken Alfredo from the pasta bar it was okay the chicken had a weird taste though. Will probably not go back would rather just go to firehouse next door."}
{"text":"We were thier today great atmosphere, lovely dining, excellent service, wonderful food, its a family atmosphere, and great for couples too, if you have a big family like mine ,, the prices were excellent for a family of 6 our bill was 60.92 total..I was like WOW! What a deal...the portions were big,, but the kids meals were great  ,,the staff was curtious , professional, and ALWAYS showed they never forgot about us even with them being very busy,, we are sure to go back again"}
{"text":"Our first time here! I had the calzone and it was great. The sausage was just a little spicy, the way I like it. The marinara dipping sauce was very nice. My mom had the lasagne and it was very authentic Italian cuisine! The service was great... Our waitress (Sara) was very personable. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We ordered an Italian calzone, baked chicken Alfredo, and kids chicken strips and fries. And had the calamari for an appetizer.   The calamari was very salty and over fried a bit. The sauces were okay that came with them. The calzone was very very good. The chicken strip were pretty good, and the fries were mediocre. Seemed like the oil they fried with needed to be change.   The baked chicken Alfredo didn't have any flavor and the chicken had the texture of being steamed or boiled and had an odd flavor.   The service was good, our server was apologetic when we explained our dissatisfaction. I'm surprised we didn't get to speak with the manager or anything. No real attempt was made to make things right. All she said was that she would let the kitchen know.   Doubt I will return."}
{"text":"I like to support local businesses over chains whenever possible, and always peek in this restaurant when I go to the Firehouse. Finally decided to try it tonight, and very happy we did so! We started off with the house Merlot, which was delicious and priced well for a bottle. I ordered the chicken Parm and my boyfriend had the margherita baked pasta. Both were cooked perfectly with fresh pasta and cheese and delivered hot out of the kitchen. Portions are very big, making the reasonable prices even more worth it. Breadsticks with oil were fresh out of the oven, too. Not a single thing to complain about. Service was excellent and our waitress was very attentive, even taking extra care because we said we'd never been. Would have liked to try their dessert to round out the visit, but no room! We will definitely be returning in the future when craving Italian. Nice atmosphere, good service, and great food. I'd definitely rather spend my money here than another Olive Garden or Spaghetti Warehouse!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this local venue for our date night as we live in Tallmadge and are looking to begin supporting local businesses more often. I cannot have gluten, therefore coming to this location in Tallmadge knowing there were gluten free pasta options, I was excited! The bread must have been good as my husband ate two baskets! I got the meatball appetizer and the marinara sauce was fantastic! Like, really really amazing. I ended up getting the baked alfredo, which is basically chicken alfredo and the chicken was very dry, I should have saved the two dollars not ordering it with chicken because I must say the sauce was great.   We also got a couple of drinks that our server was too young to even serve it to us, so I cannot imagine how that would go over if the dining room was very full or the bartender very busy.   We ordered a cheesecake for dessert, and I was not impressed at all.   Overall this was an ok experience. The menu was not creative, but I will continue to choose this place over Olive Garden as the price and quality are the same, it is a local business, and the wait isn't over an hour long."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit, and I have mixed feelings. My mom and I both got the soup/salad bar, and I added the pasta part. The biggest problem with the bar is that it's too deep. I couldn't reach anything in the back row of three. There were lots of things, chairs, boxes, not sure what all, around the ends and inside of the u-shaped bar which gave it a neglected look. The area was also very dark. The salad items were just ok. The cream of potato soup was chicken stock based, not cream based. I was surprised by the cost of soda and iced tea--$2.75. The pasta, angel hair with chicken and alfredo sauce, was bland, the chicken I suspect was pre-packaged. I'd give it one more try, possibly ordering from the menu instead. Just ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"I would love to actually give a 2.5 but that does not exist. Oh well. I will call this place the best maybe place in Tallmadge. Everything here screams of maybe. Maybe I will remodel the tired old dining area, maybe I won't. Maybe I will train my servers, maybe I will yell at them, maybe I will have some leadership, maybe I won't. Maybe the food will be good, maybe it will be mediocre as it is served from the same Kitchen as it's sister Firehouse Pub. I really don't know what the owner of this place, and basically the entire plaza from what I know, was thinking. I mean this is the laziest attempt at Italian food I have ever seen. It certainly does not seem like the dining room was remodeled from its last identity. The servers seem confused. Not sure of the menu, the ingredients or even sure of themselves. The Dessert was from someplace else. So not even a dessert they made. I saw what I believe was the head server or just a really pushy server, screaming at our server. Seriously if the owner opens places like this how is firehouse still running. Now was it awful? No. I mean the food was okay. The service was okay. But I think I lost some passion in myself from this passionless place. It  just seems like he (or she) wanted to fill the space and thought well I have firehouse they will love my Italian. Nope. I choose trying to make it myself at home. AND I DO NO COOK."}
{"text":"My husband drives past this eatery on his way to work so we finally decided to stop in & check it out. At first, I felt as if it was one of those places ones grandparents hang out at. It is definitely not a place you would see a younger crowd at but it is a good place for families. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly and the eatery was clean and quiet.   They offer a salad bar with certain meals and provide you with bread & dipping oil at each table. My friend ordered their cal zone, it was massive & jam packed full of pepperoni! I tried their eggplant appetizer- it was okay, first time I've ever eaten a traditional red sauce without getting heart burn :) A few pieces of my eggplant must've still had the seeds in it but overall it was pretty good. Their tiramuse was delicious as well.   Price wise it was fair, for four adults it was roughly $50.00 which is really not that bad. Hope to visit again and see how this business develops."}
