{"text":"We just had two steamies dressed up. The slaw on top was good but montreal pool room down the street has better hot dogs, buns and mustard. It's not a bad place for a quick bite. The service was friendly and fast. The speak English. Which is great because my French is atrocious."}
{"text":"The 99 cent steamies are awesome. Service is always friendly and the place is always clean. Does not get much better for a quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"Came here after a baseball game and I was starving. My boyfriend and I were in the mood for greasy comfort food. The poutine hit the spot. We shared it and it was delicious.   The place isn't the best but in the summer you can take to go and eat in the warm sun at place des arts. And it really doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"A little bit more pricey than I'm used to for steamies but they were delish! Staff wasn't super quick at making my food but it wasn't slow enough to become annoying. Although the upgrade to onion rings normally results in less bang for your buck I was pleasantly surprise with the amount of rings I got. YUMMY"}
{"text":"If you're looking for poutine go to Lafleur.  Super friendly service and an enormous portion of french fries with cheese curds and gravy.  I couldn't finish what I ordered...which may have saved me from an early heart attack.  Not exactly diet-friendly!  LOL."}
