{"text":"I was starving and wanted to try something new and exciting so my fiance and I decided to try Fin. It was a bit of a disappointment because I was so hungry. We ordered quite a few tapas dishes, but they were mediocre and the portions were wayyyy to small for the price. We ordered this one rice dish (it was supposed to be a grilled rice stick) and it came out looking like someone had smushed a bunch of rice together around some wooden chopsticks (no, it really did come on a pair of wooden chopsticks that weren't even broken apart). Weird. A decent amount of money spent on what could have been an appetizer at a different restaurant. And why do they shout at you as you're entering AND leaving the restaurant? it's a small place, we can hear you just fine if you speak normally."}
{"text":"Having moved last year from Vancouver, we have been searching for some good izakaya (Guu is decent, but the long waits are so frustrating).  This place on Eg near Yonge is fantastic!  Beautiful interior, great service (every single server and chef are japanese), extensive drink menu (including a sake flights, interesting cocktails).  Food is decent, usual izakaya menu.  Very fresh fish and seafood.  Prepared with lots of attention to details.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Real Japanese staff. They are very welcoming. You can sit at the bar and chat with the friendly chefs. This is the kind of place that Japanese people like to go.  The menu includes typical Japanese fare such as sushi, sashimi and salads. The presentation and quality are anything but typical. The food looks beautiful and tastes great. There's a wide variety of sake on the menu as well as sake cocktails. Japanese beer and shochu, a vodka-like spirit, are alsoon the menu."}
{"text":"I thought this place was okay compared to other Izakaya's I've been to.  The selection was limited and the portions were very small.  The atmosphere was good and prices were reasonable.  Staff were friendly and I would only go there for drinks and a light snacks."}
{"text":"It was tough to rate Fin Izakaya, because it's a hit or miss kind of place. The misses are really  less than impressive, but when you do find that one \"hit\", it is phenomenal! So really this 4 is rounded up from 3.5.  Hits: 1) Pressed Colourful Sushi -- By far this was the most interesting order of the night. When it first came, we were all so confused, because the server literally brought out a box on a plate. It was only when he lifted the wooden box that we saw a block of pressed rice and fish on the inside. Even comes with a wooden paddle for you to chop up the block to the size of your liking. Was kind of like cutting cake. Pretty neat way to eat sushi!  2) Pork Belly Skewers -- I LOVED this. The meat and fat are all marbled together on a skewer, allowing for a very firm and crisp texture, almost like biting into soft cartilage. I loved the nice clean taste of the sea salt, but the teriyaki also gave a nice smokey flavour. A highly recommended order!  3) Ebi Chili Mayo -- lightly battered shrimps with a delicious spicy mayo. I could eat a whole plate of these  4) Blowtorch Mackerel -- blowtorhced right next to your table, this dish was as delightful to watch being made as it was delicious. Didn't have that overpowering fishiness to it.  Misses:  1)Rock Salt Wings -- Decent for fried chicken, but nothing all that special. And they don't even come as full wings! Each piece only has one bone in it!  2)Beef Tongue Miso Zuke -- This was a sitrfry disaster. Everything was over sauced and mushy.   3) Tuna Tataki -- For $7, I expected more than just 3 pieces of tuna, or something done crazy to it. Average at best   4) Mentai Carbonara Udon -- Tasted like Kraft dinner cheese. Enough said.  So the moral of the story is, be careful what you order at Fin. It could make or break your meal!"}
{"text":"Was not as good as I remembered. Pricey. Servings are kinda small. Dishes are quite inventive/creative though."}
{"text":"A great IZAKAYA at the Y&E area.  Perhaps the best J-Experience in the area, authentic and tasty.    As an IZAKAYA should be, it's loud and boisterous but in a good way, though not so much that it's annoying.  The food is delicious and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu though my perennial favourite when I'm with friends is the Pork Belly skewers with sea-salt and the blow-torch mackerel.  Often times sushi places that serve mackerel will pre-boil or cook the fish a little bit before they'll put it on a sushi or serve it due to it's inherent fishiness and difficulty in keeping fresh.  Not so with the mackerel at FIN - SUPER fresh and delicious.    IZAKAYAs are watering holes traditionally, like PUBs so expect more tapas like dishes, and as such (and of course they being more a la mode these days) expect your cost to add up.  Still if you go with a group of people you can have your fill and there will be no substitute for the good times.    Service is always friendly and welcoming, and, unlike some other IZAKAYAs, they take reservations.   The decor feels authentic and an assortment of Japanese music is played on the background - and while in any other place and time a SHAMISEN rendition of a Michael Jackson hit just might be too cheezy, here it somehow seems a propos when you're amongst good company and the overall ambiance."}
{"text":"One of my go to place just to hang out with friends, have visited multiple time and definitely love the energy. The Fish auction was also super exciting.   Went last night and felt that it was a bit off, the menu seems to get smaller for some reasons. Still love everything we ordered. Will always go back."}
{"text":"To start, I lived in Japan for fours years and HATE sushi, sashimi and seaweed, so my belly was entertained at izakayas.  I  was pumped to go to an izakaya; chug jockeys of beer with many tasty, small portions of food, and not  have to pay a small fortune.  Well, Fin satisfied one of  the above features.....small portions. Now, I know that our portion sizes in North  America are considered unhealthy but when  the bill comes $70  and  I'm not even close to being \"full\",  there is a problem.  We ordered pork belly which was good (yet a tiny portion).  The octopus balls AKA okonomiaki were liked by my guest, and the fried chicken bits (karagi)  were  ok.  The sake was small and expensive.  Overall, I could have gone to a fast food joint, ordered chicken nuggets and fries for a lot less and have been MUCH more satisfied!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city. Having been to Japan, I feel this is a truly authentic Japanese experience, from the food to the service. They serve very authentic takoyaki and I highly recommend the grilled mackerel and tuna steak. I love going here!"}
{"text":"My overall experience at Fin Izakaya is fabulous!!! Since I move to Yonge subway line, it became so easy to visit nice restaurants, and Fin is one of my favourite place.  Fin Izakaya is located on close to YongeEglinton. You can easily find the place by walk and a parking lot is nearby.  As someone mentioned before, if you're very hungry then, Fin is not your place. This is because \"Izakaya\" style restaurant is a place when people feeling go drink with some small portions of food in Japan.   However, all servers are very friendly and well hospitality for customers!!!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested we come here for lunch on a weekday. It was my first time at the restaurant. Their lunch menu had a lot of choices. I ordered the kakuni pork bowl since I don't normally find it in the other japanese places that I've been to in Toronto. The pork was so soft & succulent! Service was average. It took awhile for our food to arrive & we waited a few minutes to pay our bill since the place was busy when we were done around 1pm.   I will definitely go back to try the other things in their menu. However, if you want to avail of the lunch menu, it is only available Mon-Fris. They have online reservation via open table which is a plus.  Free parking is also available but only during dinner. One of my friends drove & was told that free parking was not available over lunch."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with my boyfriend. We didn't have a reservation, and didn't have to wait for a table at all. Atmosphere is loud but not obtrusive to the point where you can't hear each other (compared to Guu). Servers are friendly despite a little language barrier. I just ended up pointing at what I want on the menu, which  worked. We ordered:  ebi mayo  pork and chicken skewers (1 each) tuna carpaccio pork belly beef rice bomb takoyaki cream puffs (dessert) 4 large sapporo mugs  Total came out to about $80 including tax + tip.  The food was very good. Everything was tasty and went well with the beer. Most menu items are basically appetizer size, which you're supposed to enjoy with alcohol. I guess that is the trick to spreading your money while filling your belly here. Menu items can be pricey and range from $3-$23.  Oh and bathrooms came equipped with mouthwash (disposable cups provided) and q-tips lol.  Definitely glad we tried this place instead of going to all-you-can-eat sushi like we usually do. But if you're feeling hungry and don't want to splurge, you can do the beer and appetizer thing at an a-y-c-e place. Lastly, compared to your local beer and wing pub, the food is on another level so I would rather go here."}
{"text":"I guess Izakaya is a new thing in Toronto. Everybody knows GUU!!! How about Fin on Eglinton?  I went to Fin Izakaya yesterday for late lunch hoping to eat some tapas with sake.....but apparently they offer different menu during lunch time. They offer donburi ( rice bowls with toppings on top) it's like Asian pizza in a bowl!  I guess they're trying to grab lunch crowds!! But did they succeed ?  The place was very empty and quiet, only 3 tables vacated  That's ok, sometime  I do enjoy quietness, found Guu can be very loud( maybe I'm getting too old) Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Guu hater, love that place!! Yam............ let's focus now,    where was I?   I ordered dynamite bowl, my hubby ordered shrimp karaage bowl and some kind maki ( can't remember the name).  They come with either steamed veggies or salad and miso soup, you can also upgrade to a larger bowl (more  rice for extra $2 or $3)  Steamed veggies were just mixed broccoli, cauliflower, yam and squash  with a teaspoon of mayo...nothing special...  My dynamite bowl: seasoned rice with some avocado and cucumber chunks, a shiso leaf, pickled gingers, fish eggs, two small tempura shrimps with drizzled mayo on top........  My hubby's shrimp karaage bowl: seasoned rice with chopped lettuce and two mid finger size deep fried shrimps with donkasu sauce.  And then the maki..... The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good either except for the deep fried shrimps....oh ya, the service was amazing!!! Shy but prompt service.  There were seven men working, all Japanese, each one of them looked so busy working and doing something.....  I'm giving them 3 stars just because I haven't tried their real deal. Will I go back? Maybe to try the dinner menu but not for lunch.  Oh ya, the tap came to $40...and we were still hungry..........   Honestly I think I can make better food!!"}
{"text":"Great place, friendly upbeat vibes. The sushi, shashimi are out of this world! Great service- a gem in the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"So, so fun!  As a sushi fan living in a city with 3 sushi restaurants per block, I did not expect to be impressed by this place.  The fairly creative menu, combined with the tapas approach, led us to try things we normally wouldn't, and it was not just tasty, but also a really fun experience.  Some folks mentioned in their reviews that the sushi wasn't that great, but we actually thought the sashimi we ordered was better than that at most of the (many) sushi restaurants we've eaten at.   Based on our experience, I would recommend that a couple order 9 different dishes to share if they are eating dinner there and want to leave on a full stomach.  The cost really adds up (maybe $75?), so this is more of a special occasion place.  Not sure how authentic it is (I'm guessing that a lot of the menu items have never been eaten in Japan), nor do I care.  I'm not a saki fan, but came almost close to liking the flavoured saki my boyfriend ordered."}
{"text":"Not the best around this area... there are other really good Japanese restaurants nearby, which serve you larger quantities and better variety.  Btw, this place is nicely decorated and has a good ambiance. Interestingly, when you walk in and go out, all of those guys working in the front end together wish you... so don't get embarrassed ;-)"}
{"text":"Food was okay but it seems like the quality has gone down since I last came here. Takoyaki was very mushy and bland. We were celebrating a birthday and had brought a cake in, but they apparently have a $7 cake service charge for us to eat it there."}
{"text":"Replica of Guu. Went during dinner time, wasn't impressed by the food. Same price as guu except I would say Guu has way way better food. Expensive but the experience and environment was nice.   I loved my waiter, he was extremely friendly and helped me pick some of our dishes; i`ll give this place an extra star for their service."}
{"text":"Excellent lively atmosphere whenever you drop by Fin. You're always greeted by the whole staff as you enter. The service was friendly however, the waitress forgot several times when I requested for a plate. Other than that I noticed they have a new menu which includes a personal bbq grill. They removed some items that used to be on their old menu which got me pretty bummed but nonetheless the food was nothing short of delicious. They have their own private parking some where in the back however to get in you must first enter and alert one of the waiters/waitresses so they can come outside and open the gate for you however for the people like me who just can't be bothered, there's a parking garage right behind Fin. Dont forget to become a Fin member so that you can get treats in the future. Just ask your server and they'll sign you up. Washrooms are very clean and offer mouthwash for those of you who may be on a date with that special someone and want to freshen up."}
{"text":"I have been here for dinner and lunch a few times.  I am a fan of both. For dinner, we have had blow torched mackerel, octopus balls, fried chicken, rice balls, fried shrimp and many more.  They were all delicious. Lunch menu is quite different.  I have had the pork curry on rice and the beef/egg on rice.  Very tasty and cannot beat the price.  Do know that the different sizes mean you get more or less rice.  The topping size is the the same.  Large was way too much rice for me."}
{"text":"A go-to when I'm craving Japanese tapas-style fare in a lively environment. I've never been disappointed. Always better with a large group.   Three words: takoyaki octopus balls."}
{"text":"The food was very very good. I had the marinated chicken along with the fried chicken along with other items.  They offer a unique selection that I didn't find in other izakaya restaurants before and my friend and I thought it was great. Service is excellent"}
{"text":"Besides their regular menu, this restaurant also offers 3 types of party menu ($25 comfortable menu, $35 Meat lovers and $40 seafood menu). Each menu requires a Minimum of 4 people. Each plate comes in a portion for 4 people,  it's not individual plated. So you can't order the party.menu if you only have 2 people. I think that's not flexible. wouldn't it be nice if each person at the table can order different menu? The restaurant owner explained this is a special party menu so it is set for 4 people portion. I would think is easy to Just do a.give menu like this for people to choose from.  We tried their $25 party menu.  Cumcumber addition Marinated salmon salad Edamame Spicy salmon tartar Sashimi 3 kinds make your own hand roll Deep fried skewers 3 kinds Sake marinated chicken kaarage Hotpot, yosenabe or sukiyaki beef with udon or rice.   The party menu portion was more than enough for 4 people with the given price, quality is just average."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a group of friends. The service was good like any other Japanese restaurants but the portions were small for the price we were paying. It's quite expensive. Not sure if I will go back."}
{"text":"I'm from Japan. There is a real Japanese \"Izakaya\" style. Cocktails are tasty; my favourite drink is the Yuzu(citrus)-chuhai. Also they are  cheerful and smart servers. I'll be there again:)"}
{"text":"Sadly Fin is now closed permanently since June 21st based on the note on the side of their door. Their Facebook page states they are closed but does not have any further information on if they plan to return or open a new location. Will miss you Fin! Please open again soon."}
{"text":"After looking at their online menu, I thought they'd have a larger selection of desserts, but that was an older menu. We decided to try some savory tapas and their ice snow parfait for dessert. To our surprise , there were cornflakes mixed with strawberries, ice cream and another topping (ie. Oreos or cheesecake). The green tea cheesecake parfait was pretty yummy and had a strong matcha flavor to the firm cheesecake , which my friend preferred. I liked the black sesame Oreo parfait more because it was sweeter and more unique! The parfait reminded me of a twist on a common breakfast item and I definitely wouldn't mind a bowl of cornflakes, strawberries and ice cream in the morning if my body let me :p   Had their salmon sashimi namabera style as recommended by the waiter. It came out as thin slices of salmon sashimi sprinkled with sesame seeds and dipped in sesame oil... The sesame oil part was good but I think I prefer thicker salmon sashimi in soya sauce and wasabi he he.   The chicken karange was also really good .. Definitely ask for a side of spicy mayo sauce! Not sure if its the same as the spicy sauce on spicy salmon rolls but there's a dab of siracha with mayo! So good!! I might go back for more tapas next time :)"}
{"text":"1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 4  Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3.5  LUNCH:  Ordered: Tempura Udon Noodle (#16) 3/5  * Udon noodles with shrimp tempura servered in mildly flavored bonito based soup for $8.95 * Soup was light and flavorful, udon was cooked just right * It came with 3 shrimp tempura as well as pumpkin, green bean and yam tempura * Batter was light on tempura and it tasted fresh * Very simple, light tasting udon perfect for lunch  Ordered: Spicy Salmon Bowl (#21) 5/5  * Spicy salmon and sliced egg over sushi rice  * Choose between Medium ($7.95) & Large ($8.95) * I ordered Medium and it was still very big for one person * This was actually really good with lots of spicy salmon sashimi, egg strips and tempura bits * Just add a bit of soy sauce to the rice and mix as you eat  Ordered: Karaage (Side menu) 2/5  * 4 pieces of deep fried chicken for $3.50 * Chicken pieces were quite big and it wasn't very hot * Usually there is seasoning on the batter but this one didn't so it was quite bland on it's own  Ordered: Octopus Balls (Side menu) 4/5  * 5 pieces of takoyaki for $5.50 * Perfect bite size takoyaki had decent sized octopus piece inside * This wasn't served very hot either * Batter wasn't too doughey   Because I enjoyed their lunch menu, I decided to return and try their dinner menu. This time, my expectation was set much higher considering I enjoyed their lunch menu and have tried many izakaya places that serves good, quality food.  DINNER  Ordered: Authentic Style beef Tataki 2/5  * Plate of seared angus beef steak with ponzu sauce topped with garlic chips for $11.95 * I was surprised to see how the ponzu sauce was served on the side * Beef tataki pieces were quite small (picked up 2~3 pieces at a time) * Overall it was very dry and could have used some more garlic chips  Ordered: Fin's Ebi Chilli Mayo 4/5  * 5 pieces of wild prawn tempura tossed in spicy mayo sauce for $7.50 * I love prawn/shrimp anything so it's hard to mess this up for me * Prawn was decent in size but the batter could have been crispier * Spicy mayo was very diluted and almost runny but overall it was delicious  Ordered: Mentai Carbonara Udon 3/5  * Sauteed udon noodle with pollock roe and pink creamy sauce topped with seaweed for $8.95 * This was served with a little block of butter on top * Mix in the butter with the udon to melt it through-out * It had very strong butter taste and it was almost too overwhelming  Ordered: Crispy Rock salt wings 2/5  * Crispy fried wings seasoned with spicy rock salt, 5 piece for $3.50 * This was a dish that was recommended by someone we knew so we decided to give it a try * Intially I thought 5 pieces for $3.50 was a pretty good deal until the wings arrived * Wings were so skinny they barely had any meat on them  Ordered: Tuna Tataki 3/5  * Seared tuna served with garlic ponzu vinaigrette for $7.00 * 3 pieces of tuna served with some vegetable * For the price you pay, this is a really small dish and tuna is not even that expensive  Ordered: Octopus Wasabi Takowasa 3/5  * Small plate of fresh raw octopus marinated with chopped wasabi roots for $3.50 * Good appetizer to have with some sake * Very strong wasabi flavor  Ordered: Blow torched Mackerel 4/5  * Vinegar pickled mackerel blow torched at your table for $8.00 * Mackerel tasted fresh but it was on the saltier side even for a vinegar pickled makarel * Dipped in ponzu sauce with side of green onion- it's very refreshing * Very distinct mackerel flavor  Ordered: Salmon Sashimi's Namareba 2/5  * Salmon sashimi with salted sesame dipping oil for $6.00 * I found this to be really weird how it was served with salted sesame dipping oil * There was so much salt in the sauce and it just did not do well with fresh sashimi  Ordered: Beef Tongue Miso Zuke 1/5  * Sizzling shaved beef tongue marinated in miso sauce for $8.00 * This was over marinated in miso sauce which made it super salty * Beef tongue is shaved so it tasted just like BulGoGi   Ordered: Pork Belly Kushi (Skewer) 5/5  * 6 pieces of pork belly on a skewer (choose sea salt or teriyaki sauce) for $3.00 * Perfect item to order when drinking beer * This was really good, you can taste the charcoal * Pork belly was just fatty enough  Ordered: Pressed Colorful Sushi (Oshi Sushi) 5/5  * Pressed sushi with diced sashimi and assorted fresh vegetables for $10.00 * This was another recommenOrdered: Pressed Colorful Sushi (Oshi Sushi) 5/5 * This is basically a chirashi pressed into a box shape * It has very nice presentation  Summary: Overall, Fin Izakaya is def one of better izakayas in Toronto. However, given the fact that I am from the city of izakayas- it didn't really impress me. I really enjoyed their lunch menu for it's quality and price but the dinner menu was either a hit or miss. For izakaya, I would go to Guu"}
{"text":"Fun place! :D Great staff atmosphere (random Japanese cheers from the staff!), really tasty food. Not many vegetarian options. NOT a sushi place.  Perfect for a youthful Japanese environment."}
{"text":"Fin is a favourite. Their food is always fresh, fast and delicious. Service is quick and really friendly as well.   I come here at least once a month for good izakaya.  Some items we always get:  miso ginger tuna tartare, shrimp rock, chicken karaage, grilled hokke, and an assortment of skewers.  They also always have a specials menu with really nice seasonal items.  Pair that with a mega Sapporo or a glass of white and you're set for the evening."}
{"text":"I'm sorry..but, how did this place even get more than 2 stars?!?! Besides the friendly staff, nothing was impressive here. Never been so disappointed at an Izakaya! Even simple chicken skewers was a fail, not to mention the staple items at every Izakaya, the carpaccio.. Uggghhhh!"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars.  Compared to places like Guu, I think Fin has got the right idea in terms of pricing, portion sizes and ambiance. The food is good, and as long as you order right, you will be full (this is coming from a guy with a bottomless pit for a stomach), and perhaps even gently buzzed.   The service was really good even though we went like 40 minutes before they closed. They help you with the orders, talk to you, introduce what's going on with each dish.  Things you've gotta try: Amaebi Karaage, Pressed Colorful Sushi, Blowtorched Mackerel, and if you're of age, the Demon Slayer sake.  For a full review complete with pictures, please visit my blog, conveniently located in my profile."}
{"text":"Just came back from the most horrific meal I've had in a year. Every dish is just pure salt. To add insult to injury it was my sister's birthday and they charged $10 for \"birthday service\" - basically singing a Japanese song and hitting a gong. Are you serious? They didn't even cut up the cake I bought, instead we had to do it. The fork they gave me was the literally the smallest fork I've ever seen, two tiny tongs which couldn't spear a cocktail weenie, and I couldn't even eat my cake slice with it. When I asked for a normal-sized fork, they ignored the order and I just had to go up and grab it from the bar. Same thing for water refills and tea refills (absolutely necessary because of the salt). Everything was so 1-dimensional, soy and salt. Portions are tiny, and I barely ate a bite. $200 for basically 4 ppl who ate (since I didn't) and 2 kids. Beyond bad...I wish I could give negative stars."}
{"text":"Very unique Japanese cuisine to me. I didn't realize it's more of a snack place than for actual meals. All the food was pretty good. My favourite entertainment had to be the blowtorch mackerel! Other foods that really made a mark was the takoyaki, squid, and sashimi. There wasn't a lineup when I went and parking lot was just located behind the building. I wouldn't come regularly though, because the cost is quite high...and I wasn't even 70% full.."}
{"text":"Came here for both lunch and dinner, and the restaurant offers different feels during different times of day. In the afternoon, the restaurant is much quieter with a few well priced lunch specials, while in the evening they offer a wide array of fairly expensive tapas. For lunch I think this place is wonderful; tastes like authentic Japanese cuisine at an affordable price. However when it comes to dinner time, I do not recommend coming here extremely hungry, unless you're willing to spend a significant amount of money. Individual items are quite small for the price, though extremely worth it in my opinion, so the bill does add up very quickly when you realize that the 2-3 items you initially ordered just isn't going to satisfy your hunger. As a result, I recommend either a) coming in large groups to help offset the price of food and try a greater variety of dishes, or b) maybe eating a little something before hand so you're not ravenous upon your arrival. Another reason why the bill tends to add up here is the enormous sake/alcoholic beverages menu, which definitely makes you curious enough to spend the money on a variety of drinks that not a lot of izakaya places may have to offer (they even let you pick your own sake glass!).  Also, atmosphere here is great, the whole staff greets you when you enter and leave, and they are also very friendly helpful. Overall this is a great place to grab lunch, or get a few drinks with friends in the evening!"}
{"text":"figures. i finally find an izakaya closer to where i live, that my friends and i all enjoy (rare), but the reviews are less than stellar.   despite its location, give Fin a chance. i hemmed and hawed when friends of friends suggested we go and actually found it to be very good! the decor is more restaurant than bar, and definitely not guu-esque, which can be a good thing depending on the situation. we went as a group of 10 to celebrate a friend's return visit from nyc. it was her request. meaning that when one wants to eat well and hear the conversation, Fin is up to par.   minus one star for, well, despite it being close'ish, the yonge/eglinton area is in the middle of nothing i usually do. nevertheless, i might just venture around this intersection just to make a return visit to eat at Fin with friends."}
{"text":"Fin is a fun place for a group of folks to enjoy some Japanese small plates and sake  If its your birthday they make a lot of noise and beat drums and stuff   Kinda cool.. The food is good too.l"}
{"text":"Went back to Fin Izakaya with some friends and it is not as good as I remembered. The portions are smaller and the prices have gone up. The quality of the food is still quite good but I have definitely been to better izakayas. The staff are very friendly and service is pretty fast. Avoid the \"biggest fotomaki\" -- at $28 there was nothing special about it. It wasn't even the biggest I have had. Hope they make improvements here because the competition is heating up."}
{"text":"Great place to have basic Japanese food, not the best.  Don't feel they should charge for tea.  6/10 - food Service 8/10"}
{"text":"Love the environment this place offers. It is very friendly and a great place for friends to hang out. Their takoyaki is super yummy, and they have these GIANT sushi rolls.   Overall a great bar to eat some authentic Japanese food while you drink."}
{"text":"I've read quite a few reviews complaining about the small portions at fin... So first off, let's get this straight....izakaya is not a place for big full dinner!! In japan, izakaya is a place to chill and have a drink after work. If you are looking for huge portions, then izakaya is not for you! Also, for those saying the sushi sucked, who eats sushi in a izakaya???   Truth is, yes portions are small, but that's the way it is in izakaya, if you want to be full, go to those all u can eat places! The food is fairly similar to what you'll get in japan, it is fresh with lots of varieties, and it is fairly authentic. The staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is great!    You should start off by  drinking a little, order a few snacks, then hot stuff/ meat dish, and then fill up on rice /noodle dish at the end...! Again, don't go to izakaya if you are looki g to get stuffed!"}
{"text":"One of my go to places for lunch (I work nearby). Fast food pricing at lunch (most meals are under $10 ) - but at a sit down restaurant with table service. Can't be beat!  It's real izakaya food run by real Japanese folks. Mostly bowls but a couple of maki rolls for those who must. The sashimi is fresh, and the \"salmon family\" - salmon and eggs - delicious. The chicken karaage is delicately breaded and fried boneless chicken pieces, in a yummy soy and ginger marinade. I'm drooling just thinking about it!  Have only been a couple of times at night, for drinks but can see that dinner is a different vibe, more Japanese tapas and a party atmosphere.   Hint: Arrive before noon to get in and out fast as it gets busy and the kitchen does back up. The salad and steamed veggies at lunch include free refills!"}
{"text":"Good service, authentic and yummy food.  Loved the traditional Japanese welcome and send off by all staff.  The mayo sauce was a bit too hot, but I loved the shiso leaf garnish (haven't tasted it since I lived in Japan).  We finished with ice cream (one of each flavour in the medium size bowl).  The black sesame ice cream is unusual and worth a try.  I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"It was so-so to me - I guess izakaya is not my thing.  I already expected the portion of food was small and price would be higher but I was still disappointed.  Not that the food was bad, but just nothing special for the price or like some people mentioned below that it could be a hit or miss and I went on a bad day.  Parking was free but the parking lot was super small and the spot was extremely tiny.  I don't think I will go back anytime soon as there are so many izakayas in Toronto, I will try a few more other ones first..."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekday evening. We tried a lot of things and everything was good. Like other Izakaya, it's run by Japanese and the staff will shout in Japanese when you come in.  The highlight was definitely the miso milk broth hot pot with udon. This is a unique taste. We also had other things like sashimi, and skewers. Everything was snack size and very delicious. Service was good.  This kind of place can get pricey. I can probably eat $100 before I'm full (I'm a big eater). But this is the kind of place you come for the atmosphere and uniqueness, not for value. I can't find this quality of Japanese food anywhere else because most places are run by Chinese doing things their way. Plus, it's a great place to hang out with people.  I would come again if I crave quality Japanese food."}
{"text":"I was trying to full filled my \"30 days yelp challenge\" for one review per day, but i just realized it passed mid night :(  AnywaysFin Izakaya  is one of my fave spots in Toronto. First time i went there with a friend,after discovering  the line at GUU is way to long, I found this place and surprisingly happy (but don't get me wrong, I am a fan of GUU too).  My fave dishes are as following FIN'S SIZZLING CHICKEN RICE SOUP, some ppl might find it plain but I just LOVE it. The stone grill is great too, chicken marinated with miso sauce, I love the moments the vege on the grill get a little bit burnt lol. Vegetarian teriyaki is good as well, 3 kinds of dipping salt, nvr now mushroom teriyaki can taste that good. If you are there during weekend do order giant rolls, although it is almost impossible to finish it.....but still worth trying  and most importantly, do check their website for tuna festival information.  Things i don't like that much is sukiyaki,too sweet for me.  I know it is not that fair to compare Fin with Guu, but i guess all people do it ,so ~ might as well.  I appreciate the quiet environment, but some of my friends like the noise at guu, so depends what you what~, also, have to say, Fin's menu does not change seasonally like Guu, (Although it has the seasonal special, but only 1 page), in my great fun period, I was there after 3 times and end up ordering similar stuff.  If we are talking about cocktails, Guu just have better choice of cocktails to me, but Fin have lots of kinds of sakes so~ really depends what you what.  Finally, last time I was there, it is getting noisy, waiters starts to say the order aloud , like GUU, again, some people might like it, but I really hope it can remain the way it used to me."}
{"text":"The parking is for free, however, it's a bit inconveniences. You will have to call someone to open the gate for you at the back area.  Overall, the food is good...but the portion of the sashimis are paper thin and expensive.  The Blowtorch Mackerel fish was the best dish I've ever tasted. Other than that, the Seafood Hot Pot in Milk Soup was really good.  we've ordered 4-5 dishes for 4 people...and due to the portion of each dishes....we were still very hungry at the end. So, we ended up going somewhere else for our second dinner."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-4 Service-4 Food-4 Strikeouts-0/3  Finn is what you can say is a modern upscale sushi place for the hungry businessmen. Actually not too expensive for lunch. Easily around $10 for their lunch special, but easily goes to $20 with all the upgrades like soup and salad.  Definitely get your money's worth with the lunch special. The fish is pretty high quality and there's not many places that would serve ikura(salmon caviar) with rice in the combo. Their miso soup is actually so good that I think there's a lot of MSG in it, but the dryness was masked by the salad. Both is unlimited refills. I suggest adding extra rice for the average man, by the extra sushi I is definitely not worth it for the price. I would rather order the dish twice. If you're willing to drop $20, everything at lunch seems worth it."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends the other day.  All the food we tried was great.  Two standouts were the chicken dashi rice soup thing and the cucumber appetizer. Amazing...  Beats Guu hands down and wow..prices are great.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"For those looking for a full Japanese dinner or lunch, you have the wrong place!! So for those who put up the really negative reviews do your research first. Just a thought.    For me this place is a great place to go if you are looking to eat, drink and talk.  The tapas, while yes the price is not cheap ( good things never are!), are just what you need to pair with a nice sake or Japanese beer. Add some good friends and you've got some jolly good fun, Japanese style! The takoyaki balls there are one of the best we've had in TO.  Skewer sticks, to die for and the tempura is amazing! Just lightly battered!  The sashimi and sushi, while limited in selection are really fresh! Especially there specialty, tuna, which the entire fish is hand carved there once a week. Guu, while it is a louder izakaya, has a different menu all together and choice on food and beverage is equal in it's limits. Honestly, for those comparing, one is REALLY loud and the other is MODERATELY loud. Depends which one you're looking for or prefer! The staff are really friendly, even with language barriers they all try their best, and for those who said they were oblivious to the portion sizes, I think they are well aware, but I really don't think it's their decision!!   All in all a wonderful experience, time and time again."}
{"text":"Service slow and unfriendly. Price is quite high considering the quality of food. More like a restaurant than a traditional Izakaya"}
{"text":"Located uptown, just about a block away from Eglinton station is this trendy yet traditional izakaya. It has a nice, intimate atmosphere that appears to cater more to smaller groups and dates rather than big celebrations or special occasions.  My two favorite dishes of the night were the Pork Skewers and the Beef Rice Bomb. I HIGHLY recommend ordering both of these - absolutely delicious. The pork skewers in fermented rice koji sauce was amazing. Pork was nice and succulent. I could easily eat 10 of these and if I ever come back, it would be for this.  5/5  The beef rice bomb is just under $4 and there's a daily limit to how much they serve. Get it if you can! We were afraid it would be tiny but were pleasantly surprised that it was a fair portion for the price. The beef is dried, almost to a jerky level (but not quite there and still tasty!) wrapped around a ball of rice. It delivered all the right flavors and I'm so glad we ordered it. 4.5/5  Yuan Miso Roasted Chicken was actually pretty good. Well-seasoned and would've tasted great with a bowl of white rice. But at the end of the day, it really is just roasted chicken so take that for what you will. 4/5  Beef & Pork Hamburg on a stone hot plate was picture AND video worthy as you could still see/hear it sizzling. But I wish it tasted as good as it looked because the patty was a tad dry and lacking in flavor. 3/5  My least favorite was the Takoyaki. It was drowned in sauce and was more batter than anything. Pretty much a timbit with a few scraps of octopus. 2/5  Sashimi & Ikura Cucumber Roll was cool albeit not that great. It comes out with assorted sashimi piled on top of a cucumber roll. They then give you a bowl full of ikura and ask you to put as much of it as you can/would like onto your roll (without spilling any). I struggled really hard with this because the plate was strategically small but I still managed to get a decent amount. The sashimi didn't seem very fresh and the roll was soo dry. You're pretty much paying for the ikura because that was the single best thing about this dish. It didn't taste good WITH the roll, but just alone. 2/5  Dessert was a little disappointing. We got the Black Sesame icecream & Oreo Parfait ($7) as well as the Vanilla Icecream & Green Tea Cheesecake Parfait ($8.75). Icecream scoop is small and 60% of the bowl was whipped cream. The granola was literally Kellog's cereal corn flakes. Dessert just wasn't as thought-out as I would've liked. Components were low quality and the overall taste warranted only about half the price. Not worth. 2/5 for both  Service got too slow towards the end. We waited so long for our last dish (the ikura roll) that we were tempted to just cancel it. Kept asking them check up on the status of it (pretty sure they forgot) and they would disappear for periods of time without a response. They managed to let us off on a better note as I thought it was a nice touch at the end when our waitress walked us right out to the door to say goodbye.    The bill came out to about $70 after-tax & tip. Not bad because we were both really full. My experience was far from memorable so I wouldn't care to come back but its a nice environment to come after work for a casual drink and snack for those in the area."}
{"text":"Been there fore couple of times~ food is really good, miss the beef hotpot they have during winter~ mackerel is excellent . Every dish is delicate and tasty~ but the portion is really small haha~"}
{"text":"A Fin Izakaya Dude came out to meet me at streetside so he can show me the Parking Lot and open the Private Gateway in wet weather.  The service continues to satisfy once inside the Izakaya.  Taking orders, friendly smiles, misunderstanding English.  The usual.    Taiko Drum is an excellent idea giving any celebrations authenticity and excitement.  At least it helped wake me up from my overworked brain-meltdown.  Too tired to think what to drink, so just ordered 'Wing($5.75)' and was so thirsty I nearly chugged it.  Food as one of our Izakaya-virigin Yelper states was hit & miss, but the more I think about it the more I believe it's one or two disappointing dishes that got us hungry diners in a bad mood.  I also considered some dishes as comparison to other Izakayas.  All things considered, Fin is a reasonable drinking establishment and the experience is heighten upon your selection of better food items over some of the underpar/overvalued fare.  Otherwise Fin's a fine place to go after work to chat with your co-workers and let things loose.  Ebi Mayo($7.50) Chicken Eye Patty($6.50) Duck Shichimi Yaki($8.50) Tsukune Skewer($3.00) Octopus Wasabi Takowasa($3.50) Crispy Rock Salt Wings($5.50)"}
{"text":"This is the second time my husband and I came to Fin. Such great service, food, and tea! They serve roasted green tea which is combined with roasted brown rice. By far one of the best green teas I've had. We ordered the Miso Ginger Tuna Tartar, Blowtorched Mackerel, Fin Shrimp Rock, Takoyaki Octopus Ball, Mini Deep Fried Octopus and Seafood Hot Pot. Everything was delicious except the mini fried octopus. It tasted similar to chicken karage. We probably could have done without that. But all else was exceptional! My husband lived in Japan for two years and he says the food is up to par with the izakaya's in Japan. Not to mention, they have the hard-to-find Asahi dark beer! Thanks Fin for another fantastic dinner!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner tonight with my parents.  Had:  Blowtorched mackerel ($9.50) - made me realize the website menu is outdated. If I'm not mistaken, it says it's $9. Anyhow, they blowtorch it at your table. Fancy. Didn't really do much for the dish though. To my knowledge, blowtorching is supposed to make the skin crisp. It wasn't particularly crispy. For those of you who have never had mackerel, it's quite fishy. I like it though. Although there were quite a number of pieces, the pieces were smaller than I expected, size-wise.  Takowasa ($3.50) - raw octopus marinated in soy and wasabi stem/root or something. Portion was quite small for $3.50. octopus was chopped up into fairly small pieces. I quite enjoyed the flavor of the wasabi on the octopus. Some of the pieces were more tender than others. Some pieces were quite chewy. They should have given us a spoon, as the pieces are quite difficult to pick up with chopsticks.  Self-bbq set (forget the name of this) - cost just under $37. Had 4 oysters (small), 4 mussels, 2 whelk, 1 plate of salmon in butter with enoki mushrooms, 1 tin of sardines, 2 spices of pumpkin, 2 slices of carrot, 2 skewers of cherry tomatoes (3 tomatoes on each), some slices of cabbage and some slices of king oyster mushroom. Came with 2 dipping sauces - one tasted like garlic butter with alcohol in it, and the other tasted like soy sauce. This was cute, but some of it, veggies especially, were difficult to bbq because they were so thin and burn easily. It was also not worth $37. On the menu, the tin of sardines is $4.50. I can get a tin of sardines (unless this is some fancy imported Japanese brand that comes in the same tins) at Shopper's for like $1.25...  Giant red shrimp sashimi ($8) - two shrimp. Actually giant. About the circumference of a nickel and slightly longer than two of the rectangular soy sauce dishes (including the head). Delicious. Absolutely amazing. From Argentina, we were told. Shrimp flesh was juicy, sweet and succulent. Shrimp heads were filled with shrimpy goodness. Highlight of our night. Had we not decided to order this, this review would have been a 2.5 star review (for less than stellar previously reviewed foods, very loud greetings [the first time is cute but it gets irritating], and the slightly slower service].  Green tea creme brulee ($4) - definitely green tea. No brulee in sight. To my knowledge, brulee involves crispy sugar that has been torched. This should be on the top of the creme brulee. There was no crispy torched sugar in sight. Matcha was definitely prominent. Not so creamy because of the amount of matcha powder in it. For $4 though, not bad. I've had better though.  Red bean cheesecake - It was my parents' 28th wedding anniversary (hooray for them!), and they asked if anything special could be done. The server brought them a fairly large slice of red bean cheesecake on a plate that someone had written \"happy anniversary 28th\" (yes, with that Engrish) in chocolate. Complimentary, of course. That was nice of them, as on the menu, this dessert is listed at $7.50. Look-wise, it looks like a no-bake cheesecake in a Keebler graham crust, but with a layer of red bean paste at the bottom. Taste-wise, it's slightly heavy on the vanilla, but pretty good. Lovely cut strawberry rose on top, and they had a candle for my parents to blow out. Not worth $7.50, but a totally sweet gesture.  Total damage after tax but before tips: $78 something.  I'll probably be back to try their hot pot dishes ($13 something + $3.50 for rice or udon/ramen). Seems like a good portion and smelled delicious."}
{"text":"Their lunch menu ain't that bad.  It's usually sushi or seafood mush on top of sushi rice.  The dinner menu is bizarre with a lot of izakaya based dishes.  It's ok to go once - probably won't return."}
{"text":"GOOD: Love their seafood rice and duck breast salad. Seafood rice comes with raw sashimi and they mix them in the hot pot.. It's becomes half cooked afterwards and it tastes pretty good. Also free appetizer for tagging them on instagram!  BAD: super small portion for the sake seafood clam soup? Not worth it. Waiters are just ok."}
{"text":"I'll be a bit of a dissenting voice here on the \"yay\" side of Fin Izakaya, though I confess that I'm a bit incredulous on the price vs. what you get.  Still, our experience was very positive, and the food was delicious... so, even if it's \"pub fare\", it's done very well and probably worth the extra couple bucks per dish that we spent above and beyond what the naysayers believe is reasonable for what's on offer.  Hm.  That was a bit wordy.  Anyway.  We had wakame salad (best I've had in TO), rock salt wings (delicious, and as I recall two different flavours), tuna negima, takoyaki (oh my god, wow!), squid natto (an experience, but not one I'd repeat), yosenabe (the only \"meh\" dish we had), and some assorted maki that, while I forget the name, was very well made and quite tasty.  For drinks we tried a few different sake, and I enjoyed a very nice plum wine after dinner -- all were satisfying and, unsurprisingly, matched the dinner well.  Outside of this, the ambience was classy without being stuffy (perhaps even beautiful), with courteous service that bordered on a bit staid; given that neither of us was feeling our best, this was actually a good thing.    I know that as an izakaya people expect a lively, raucous pub atmosphere... in this, Fin probably falls short (perhaps even well short).  If you're looking for very well done Japanese comfort food, however, you'll probably be impressed.  And, for the record, we left feeling full but not stuffed, and while the bill wasn't discount-diner, neither was it outrageous.  All in all, recommended and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Anyone who thinks this place rocks is seriously delusional.   It was inevitable that we'd end up spending money here, as my Fiance put it...better to waste money on lunch than drop a crapload at dinner...in this case, for crap.  We were drawn into this place by the big sign that advertises how they're THE lunch place for the corporate types. Sounds good....their 'dons' were the best deal apparently...beef don was $4.95. Woohoo!  Anyway, we get in there, and the decor is gorgeous. Really nice, Japanese decor, clean simple but stylish. Looked expensive. Even the bathrooms were nicely done ... it looked traditional. And expensive.   My fiance orders the large size beef teriyaki don... I believe it was around $8. I opted for the variety of mushroom and egg don..$7.. and of course, in my opinion, the true test of a good Japanese restaurant...the California roll.. and at $8 a hit, it wasn't cheap at all (I'm from Vancouver where $7.50 gets you a california roll done up to the nines with REAL crab meat).  The food arrives and the dons are disappointing. Picture a bowl filleld up 3/4 of the way with rice. My fiance's was topped with a shallow layer of beef, dry, not enough sauce. My mushroom and egg don was again, a shallow layer of 2-3 kinds of mushroom and some egg....very dry. I had to ask them for some teriyaki sauce on the side.   The california roll arrives like, 10 minutes later. And guess what? The rice has no vinegar taste, the rolls are small and what really peeved me off was the fact that the crab meat wasn't even shredded or anything it was just a stick of fake crab meat slapped in with some cukes, a rail thin piece of avocado.   Seriously, T&T even uses shredded crab meat and mixes it in with mayo. This place charges you $8-$9 for a fricking Cali roll and can't even bother to do anything fancier than cutting up a stick of fake crab meat.  A total jip. I will never return and am thankful we only spent our money at lunch time and not a dinner.   The high prices don't match the food, it matches the amount of rent they pay and the cost of the decor."}
{"text":"Food is ok compared to Toronto izakaya standard.  Don't like the way they do business though.  We brought a birthday cake to share,  and there was a $7 surcharge.  Then they offered to allow you to pay $10... they would throw in some fancy celebratory drumming!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Parking is kind of a pain. Basically, you have to go to a little side street located near 76 Eglinton Avenue East (next to Formocha cafe)  and call the restaurant to come out and buzz you in at the gate. It's free parking, but definitely an inconvenience because we had to call a couple of times before someone picked up.  The restaurant was super busy so I recommend that you make a reservation ahead of time. Hip hop music was blasting in the background! I liked it, but it kinda didn't fit with the restaurant since they had a very japanese feel. The food is tapas style with a lot of unique dishes like raw octopus, blowtorch mackerel, small hot pot meals, shrimp sashimi, skewers, and seafood salads. They even had a salmon and ikura (salmon roe) don where they encouraged me to scooped as much ikura into my bowl as I could. It was a unique concept! The food was pretty delicious. For food alone, I would give this place a 4/5.  However, points are deducted for the service and parking. The service was super slow because they were super busy. We had to ask 3-4 times for our drinks to come. Don't get me wrong, the servers were super friendly and polite, but it was just slow!  When the bill came, it was automatically split up per person so we didn't have to do the math. Pretty convenient. For 6 people, we each paid about $30, which was not bad. Definitely recommend to bring a group of people so you can try different dishes!"}
{"text":"My managers and coworkers have their lunch here on a regular basis. I finally tried it and now I can see why they always go here for lunch.   The price is reasonable. I got a bowl and a miso soup, it was just over $10.   The service is quick. They understand you're here for your lunch break, they hussle to serve you and they do it with huge smiles.   The environment is lively. They yell out something to everyone who enters and leaves the place. I don't know what they're saying, but it's pretty awesome.   The food is yummy. I've had miso soup a gazillion times and hands down, they make the best one. I didn't think miso soup could taste that good. It's 50 cents add on, but it's free refill. Trust me, you'll go for seconds.   Overall, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Japanese restaurants.  There is free parking in the back.  Call to get instructions on the parking beforehand.   Everything here is great.  I particularly liked the tapa bento box mix.  I think if was an extremely good deal and full of awesomeness."}
{"text":"I came here again on a Monday night for dinner, I must say I was disappointed. 3 - 3.5 stars this time. The options were somewhat limited (they didn't have the bowl of shrimp sashimi I had last time :( ), and the food was either a hit or a miss.  We ordered the following: Takoyaki, Pork belly skewers, deep fried shrimp with taro chips, salmon & ikura don, and three layered bento box for three people.  Let's start with the usual appetizers. Takoyaki was less salty, but less octopus in it than last time. Pork belly skewers were good, and the deep fried shrimps were pretty good too. These were the regular hits.  Then we got our bento box, which was a LOT smaller than we expected for the price. It can probably fill one person at most. Please treat it as a sampler rather than a main dish. It is seasonal, so the actual content may change from time to time.  First layer consisted of \"Fresh Raw Octopus\", \"Lotus Salad\" and \"Seaweed Salad\". The octopus and lotus salad were a HUGE hit. They tasted awesome. Highly recommend you to order those two dishes from the menu. Seaweed salad is quite average, there isn't anything special about it.  Second layer consisted of Takoyaki, beef, and deep fried chicken. We already had the Takoyaki so it was nothing to rave about. The deep fried chicken was absolutely AMAZING and worth droooooling over. The beef however was very over cooked and was HUGE miss with us. It would have been better if it was beef sashimi instead.  Third layer consisted of \"Tuna Spicy Honey Yukke\", Assorted Sashimi (Tuna, Yellowtail & Salmon) and \"Spicy Salmon Tartar\". The Tuna Yukke was really good, especially with the cucumber, it makes a great appetizer. The sashimi was fresh, the wasabi was freshly grated. I personally like the Tuna the best. Salmon sashimi is usually my favourite, but I expected better quality salmon from this place so I was slightly disappointed. The spicy salmon tartar was a miss. The spicy mayo was way too overpowering and covered the goodness of the actual salmon. Definitely a miss as well.   We got our salmon with rice last. The waiter will bring over a bowl of fish roe. Don't be fooled, you can only get one scoop (as per stated from the menu) out of it, and the portion is quite small. it was decent, but again a miss since there isn't anything too special about it.   Overall, the bill came out to about $70 and we were no where near full. We ended up going to somewhere else after for a second dinner =\. So, I recommend coming here on a weekend. It seems like they have better stocks for a weekend dinner."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the reviews are so good. This is easily the worst izakaya in the city. The food and service are dismal. I've tried it a few times to be sure because it's so close to me, but it fails every time."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for izakaya, usually came here for dinner with a group of friends.  Chatting, sharing good foods, nice services.  Love their Sashimi, Blowtorched Mackerel, Beef Rice Bomb, Takoyaki, etc.  The portion in dinner is a bit small, so usually will either order 3-4 rounds or go to a ramen place afterwards.  Lunch menu is highly recommended between my friends.  AND FINALLY, I got a chance to try their lunch lately.  And yes, lunch at Fin gave me a very very nice break between work.  Still nice quality food, but the price is cheaper :-D"}
{"text":"The cooked foods are good, but the prices and setting are more upscale than the food itself. Grilled pork belly and beef, while good, don't normally need an upscale setting to be enjoyed. The marinated raw octopus was tasty and the fried chicken was crunchy, but bring your wallet if you want to leave full."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times for lunch, and once for \"dinner\". The lunch menu is reasonably priced, but the Izakaya style snacks and drinks at night could easily cost a small fortune.  The food is great; authentically Japanese and very tasty. Unfortunately, a few of my lunch visits have been met with horrendously slow service. Most of my coworkers have it on their blacklist for this reason alone. On one occasion, our lunch took nearly two whole hours; maybe 20 minutes of which was spent actually eating. We asked them for the bill six times. Awful!"}
{"text":"The Izakaya experience has invaded Toronto, for better or for worse; unlike it's peers however, the Fin dining experience stands out as a gem among the rubble.   Owned and run by Japanese culinary professionals, Fin has never once disappointed my expectations. The sashimi is always fresh, the ribs are always tender, and the staff are always friendly and professional. Given the price point, the quality delivered is shockingly fantastic, and frankly, comparable in fact, with a Ja, or a Yuzu No Hana.  Fin is a true gem located in Mid-town, shining against the mediocre dining options of Yonge and Eglinton."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I understand the mixed reviews of this place.  Fin has a nice atmosphere - busy and lively but not so busy that you will have to wait for a table.  They even take reservations.  The food is delicious and the menu is quite large.  I'm a big fan of the pork belly skewers (they come in either sea salt or teriyaki - both are good), the takoyaki octopus balls, and the salmon lover (salmon sashimi served 3 ways).   On a second visit, my friend and I shared the \"3-storied bento box\", which includes a small serving of about 12-15 different items, and is a great way to experiment if you're a little adventurous.  My only criticism:  I was a bit disappointed and confused that the egg custard, which is served in both summer and winter versions, was still being served in its winter version at the end of May (and while it was 30 degrees).  Prices are quite reasonable given the quality.  Two people can eat dinner for between $30 - $50 total, without drinks."}
{"text":"Fin Izakaya is a welcoming and trendy restaurant. My friend and I came for dinner right when it opened (at 5:30 pm), and the waiter informed us that we had to leave at 8:30 pm because their restaurant was fully booked that night. The waiter yelled IRRASHAIMASE! and the other workers echoed the word with great enthusiasm. She ushered us into a spacious U-shaped table that had a lovely centrepiece of (fake?) bamboo shoots and a Lucky Cat statue.   The iced water contained little slices of lemon in it and was refilled frequently. A free appetizer was brought up for us, which was a cup full of sticks that tasted like salted pretzels. We ordered Fin's Tapas Bento Mix, and this contained a three-story tall bento box. The top layer housed cold appetizer tapas, the middle layer with hot tapas, and the last layer with sashimi and diced-up fish. I highly recommend it if this is your first time at Fin's- you can try out a variety of tapas at a decent price!  We also got the blowtorched mackerel, which is a plate full of mackerel sashimi that the waiter blowtorches in front of you. The torched mackerel was small in size and slightly smoky from the heat; as well, they had their own sauce for the mackerel! Our order was enough for two people, and close to ~$50. It's a little expensive for the size so I took a star off, but other than that I would come back!  I also really dig their eclectic mix of tranquil koto music and Nicki Minaj."}
{"text":"WARNING: RED ALERT - DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY APPETITE WHATSOEVER!   So I buy a voucher for this place and I figure, hey, what the heck - surely that will cover the cost of dinner, no? I mean, the menu prices look reasonable and the food in the photos look substantial. Unfortunately, the photos on the menu take their inspiration from the movie \"Honey I shrunk the Kids\". As in...teensy weensy bites of mediocre food delivered in unpredictable fashion over 45 minutes.   I came here on a Thursday night with Lauren and both of us were ravenous by the time we left. I guess the FOUR WHOLE frozen grapes they give you as your complimentary dessert (for two people no less) should suffice, non?  The tuna dish we ordered smelled and tasted like it had seen better days - very fishy and smelly. The hot pot was mostly water and a few meagre strands of overcooked cabbage. Wait staff seem completely oblivious to your basic signals and do not warn you that the portions are microscopic. TERRIBLE.   You will need to go out for dinner or lunch AGAIN after you come here because even if you spend the ridiculous amount of money to cover an adequate amount of food, you will be waiting so long that you will be STARVING no matter what. Basically there is no reason to go to this place. The food sucks, the portions are a joke, the service is inept at best, and the prices will only shock you once you consider what you're paying for.  There is one and a half hours of my life I'll never get back. Fin indeed."}
{"text":"I met friends there for lunch a couple Fridays ago.  We had donburi (rice bowls with toppings). Included with the meal are a bowl of miso soup and a salad or veggies for about $7.  Great deal!  I had chicken teriyaki and rice.  My friends had sake marinated soy flavoured deep fried chicken and rice and tempura veggies and rice."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere is great.  Good selection of Japanese tapas-style dishes..delicious and different but portions are very small for how much they are. If you go there hungry, your meal will be pricey. If you are looking for a place to sit, chat, drink,  try unique Jap. dishes, then I recommend this place.  This is what I had in the order of my likings:  SWEET SHRIMP KARAAGE- Must Have!! Crunchy and delicious MISO-TUNA TARTAR- I love tuna and this was made to perfection! SCALLOP BUTTER SOY SAUTEE- You can really savour the true taste of scallop with each bite. Bit chewyer than other scallops, more like calamari taste but I really enjoyed it DUCK SHICHIMI YAKI- Probably one of the best duck dishes I have had, but bit too oily for me. Mind you I am not really a duck fan to start with. Probably won't get it next time, only cuz I want to try something else! Tun   Wide variety of sake menu:  I think we had OKUNOMATSU KINMON and it was very subtle, yet smooth down your throat.  Also had Fresh Lime Chuhai- Don't get this, it's just lime, carbonated soda and ice w/ bit of sake. Prob better to go w/ sake cocktails girls."}
{"text":"Izakaya is a decent chain of traditional Japanese fare and comes very close to a lot of the authentic stuff I had in Japan during my time there. I'll come out and say it, if you have a very narrow view of what Japanese cuisine is, then this is definitely not the place for you. This place has great ambiance and an unusual but effective seating arrangement that maximizes the space. Staff is very friendly and in my experience is very precise in carrying out requests/orders even if service is on the slow side.   What I will say is the current pricing definitely does not add up, portions are very small but this is supposed to be a higher end establishment so I kind of expect it, even though booze is on par with competing bars and resto pubs in the area. Food is subtly seasoned as is tradition within Japan, so if you're looking for something super exotic you will be disappointed. What you can expect is good healthy food that wont leave you feeling guilty after, even if your wallet may feel violated."}
{"text":"Haven't tried dinner here but their lunch menu is the best ( I work close by). They will shout in Japanese when you first step in and when you come out (which is a bit awkward for me).   There are many options on their lunch menu and it's hard for me to actually choose one. But, just to be safe from disappointment, I always stick with one same dish whenever I'm here: Ebi Chilli Mayo Don ( spicy shrimps on rice). It's very tasty and it's better if you add a little chilli powder.   I have tried their Karaage Chicken and Egg, it was bland. And since I have allergy to onions and I had to pick them out myself (the kitchen already pre-made them with onions), it was a turnoff for me. The tofu teriyaki on rice is pretty good as well if you're a vegan. The Pork Katsu Bowl was good, but I started to feel sick and heavy after finishing 1/3 of the bowl. The pork is perfectly breaded and topped with tasty sauce. If you want to finish it, you should order Miso soup to help you with the dryness from the meat. Extra miso soup is only $0.50 but free refill (Yay! And also free refill on salad and steam veggies)  My colleague always order sashimi with rice. It looks super fresh! If you really love having sashimi for lunch, make sure to come here early for lunch. Their sashimi dishes run out fast!!! I also heard they have auction for fish of the day, which is very interesting. Hmppp!! Raw Fish!!!  The portion size is decent for me and the price is very reasonable. The service is fast, staffs are very friendly and attentive.   I will always come back here for lunch and will definitely come here to try out their dinner menu soon."}
{"text":"Service here was very friendly. One of the waitresses had a big smile on her face the whole time and she brought out a platter of different kinds of fresh fish for us to see and decide if we wanted sashimi. It was interesting that they also did a food auction for sashimi.    Food wise, they were average to good. They give you fried pasta sticks as a complimentary appetizer. We tried Takoyaki, Tuna Tataki, Beef Sukiyaki and Chicken Karaage. I enjoyed their Takoyaki the most. Chicken Karaage and Tuna Tataki were similar to the ones I've had elsewhere. Beef Sukiyaki was a delicious mix of enoki mushrooms, cabbage and beef slices. Sukiyaki broth tasted like Bulgogi sauce mixed with water, a lighter version of Bulgogi. It was fun cooking the sukiyaki. I'd try different dishes if I'm here again."}
{"text":"This place is definitely pretty loud and busy on a Friday night but nice for a izakaya.  The service is prompt, attentive and there is a fairly large menu.  Everything was very tasty--I particularly liked the fried mackerel. The dishes are small so don't hesitate to order several."}
{"text":"I love this place, everything on the menu reminds me of good old tokyo, even thought some of the dishes were not necessarily spectacular. And yes, things are a bit more salty than you would expect in Canada, all the reason it reminds me more.  Chicken wings are split in half, so that it's easier to eat. Portions are small, so you can order more items. Service is attentive. Some dishes were surprising. Mentai ika is awesome.  However, the prices are definitely not of an izakaya, and were a bit on the steep side."}
{"text":"If you want an afterwork drink with some light food, Fin is your place. If you're hungry, you will most likely have to pay more than you'd normally would, since you'd have to order more dishes, given how small they are. They are not meant to be like normal portions you'd get at a typical restaurant, because Izakaya in Japanese culture is primarily a drinking establishment where food is served to accompany the drinks. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy my experience at Izakaya. I did. However, I left the place hungry after ordering some yakitori and soup. I can echo the comments of Ronnie F (3/22/2013). If you want to leave this establishment full, you'll have to leave a small fortune. If you're cool with that, by all means, Izakaya is waiting for you."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AN ABSOLUTE PISS-TAKE!  I really should have listened to Sarah Y's review: \"ANYONE WHO THINKS THIS PLACE ROCKS IS SERIOUSLY DELUSIONAL\" Amen.  What a horrible dinner. I'm not exaggerating when I say it is one of the worst dining experiences of my life.  When you walk in, Fin Izakaya definitely looks like it has great potential. The decor is really cool/unique. Kind of classy.  We went for dinner, were seated promptly (2 of us) and selected 4 items off the menu to share, figuring we could order a few more later on if it wasn't enough.  The food was absolutely ridiculously small portions. Really small portions and exuberant pricing for dishes with very simple/cheap ingredients. I can handle overpriced (sometimes) if the food is unique and delicious, but the crap served here was not worthy of high prices.   \"Fresh vegetables with Moromi Miso with a sweet blend of barley grains and miso\" ($5). This was essentially 3 carrot sticks, 4 slices of cabbage and 1 radish served with 1 teaspoon of some dipping sauces.   \"Grilled eggplant with miso sauce\" ($5). This was the only thing that was actually tasty. Too bad about the portion size - 6 thimble sized pieces of eggplant.  \"Bonito Tataki w/  Crunchy Garlic - Seared bonito sashimi with garlic chips and citrus ponzu sauce\". ($9.50) This was rancid. Really. The fish was fully cooked through (wtf?) instead of seared. We were given 4 minuscule slices, perhaps 1oz in total, served over some sauteed onion slices. It looked nothing like the photo, we didn't even finish eating it because the fish tasted off/rotten.   \"Ribeye beef sukiyaki -Thinly sliced beef and vegetables cooked in house made sukiyaki sauce\" ($12.50) Note if you want rice/udon you have to pay $5 extra?!!?! wtf? Essentially, for $12.50, we got 2oz of beef and some cabbage and onions simmering in a tiny pot of beefy flavoured broth.  At this point we were still freaking starving, but realized we would probably have to order another $60-$80 worth of food to even feel somewhat satiated. We saw some other tables being served other tiny amounts and thought better of ordering more. Edamame at this place ($3.50) gets you about 10 pods...seriously.  The food also took ages to come out, we waited 20 mins after our other dishes for the hot pot to arrive. Staff was friendly but portrayed an air of ignorance when food was brought out in ridiculous small portions and customers looked perturbed.   They also f*cked up our bill. Oh, but you get free FROZEN GRAPES (4 of them!!!) as a treat, comes with the bill.   This was the first time ever in my life that I actually had to leave a restaurant and immediately go elsewhere for another entire meal because I was so hungry."}
{"text":"My experience at Fin has always been fantastic. They have a membership point system and offer discounts after you visit enough times.  My favorite dishes are by far the blow-torch mackerel and the squid balls. Sashimi is always fresh, great service, intimate setting, and the food is better than Guu in general."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and high quality. Service is good as all other Japanese restaurant run or owned by Japanese. Impressive that washroom has additional cleaning kits for customers. Environment is nice. Price is actually ok, a bit expensive. Overall very good."}
{"text":"Everything is super delicious.  Melt-in-your mouth pork belly keeps revisiting me in my dreams.  The service is always friendly and reliable.  The staff give you a nice welcome holler when you enter the restaurant.  I only wish my wife was this happy to see me come home at the end of the workday.  One of my favourite restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Was there for lunch. the lunch menu is not bad for the prices, but the portions are a little small. The raw fishes are really fresh compare to some cheaper Japanese restaurants. Unfortunately the waiters need more training."}
{"text":"This place have the best Japanese food in town, no other places can beat them.  I heard the owner is a  Japanese person.  Fresh sashimi, love their salmon, their hot food are great."}
{"text":"I came here under the recommendation of a friend who said Fin is parallel to Guu. Although i've never been to Guu, we had a 12 people party, there was just no way for Guu and so I booked this place.  Because this place is so much bigger than Guu, my friends said the atmosphere is already lost. Theres no very loud crowd drinking and cheering; it's a rather calm dining experience.  All the sashimi dishes were great but none of the rest of the dishes were memorable. I recommend against getting the Ground Wagyu Beef; it is essentially a beef patty with horseradish or cheese on top. The sukiyaki ended up being a tiny hotpot with sukiyaki flavour. I did like the udon noodles but it was nothing breathtaking. The shrimp was good too. The duck tasted kinda earthy.   This place is good, just not great."}
{"text":"OK - so the theme of this review is essentially that the quality of a dining out experience has to do with more than just food, to which i actually give a 7.75/10, but: - style and decor:  7.5/10 - ambiance and vibe: 2/10 - cleanliness & presentation: 5/10 - service & timing: 8/10 - company (as in the people you're with companions) and conversation: 10/10 :) i may be biased because i'm just not a huge fan of yonge/eg ... and i'm coming off of comparing this to the 3 wicked/amazing/beautiful experiences at the hapa izakaya's in Vancouver during a month long epic western Canadiana piece of history making adventure i'll rave about to grandchildren one day. anywhoo ... i'll try to find some time to get lit on sake for a few hours while waiting for a seat at Guu in the near future for the izakomparisonz."}
{"text":"I like the vibe but it is rather loud and noisy overall. The food is okay, nothing spectacular, but not bad either. The prices are average. The oysters are all one price and pricey, so it would be prudent to get the kinds that are the most expensive elsewhere, unless of course they only have the cheaper ones at the higher price. I did not eat nor ask for oysters and instead opted for a seafood assortment. Considering a variety of factors like parking, accessibility etc. I could possibly go here by public transit if joining friends, but I would not plan to bring friends and family."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Servers are very kind and polite. The plating is beautiful. Sushi and Sashimi are really fresh. Shrimp Karaage is my fav here. But Soup and grills on a hot stone plates are quite disappointed. They are blander and the portion is very small for the price."}
{"text":"Fin Izakaya may not be Guu... but I found the experience here was just as delightful.   The staffs here are wonderful. Friendly, Patient, Accommodating. Our smiley waiter was so funny when I took out my camera ready to take photos of our food, he rushed over so fast and wanted to a photo of me with my yelp group! :) So now I have a rare non food/restaurant photo.   Our plan at least my plan was to have a drink here and we each order 2 dishes to share... which worked out beautifully as we have a taste of the items and won't get too carry away... As one know, Izakaya is not a place to stuff yourself but a place for a drink, snacks and talking nonsense to your friends.   Food took awhile to arrive, but we were all cool about that since it is a great opportunities for us to get to know each other more and for my overworked yelp friend to arrive just in time for the food.   The food was not bad, as I was distract a lot from actual tasting of the food because I was laughing, drinking and eating was the last thing I have in mind... Hey but we finished everything... and my other yelp friends were not complaining..   Damage was $20/person... I spent a lot more at Guu.....and here I don't need to wait for a table!   BTW, CP24 was showing on the plasma TV near the sushi bar in case someone wants to know...."}
{"text":"I don't think I'll be coming back here again. I'll give points for nice environment and nice service, but I think what you pay for here is definitely not worth it. The dishes are pretty expensive compared to others. They have a grill by the bar which is pretty cool, you can watch them grill on the spot. The   We got the ikura cucumber salmon roll, basically it's unlimited ikura. When we got it, the ikura came separately in a little bowl. the waiter stood there and said she had to watch us pour it on the rolls because it was unlimited and didn't want us to use it on any other dishes, so we do it and empty the small bowl of ikura. 5 minutes later we ask for more, and she tells us that was the last batch... I then ask for more wasabi (they gave us really little) and she said there's a charge. I have never been charged for extra wasabi! Their excuse is that it's real, but it honestly tasted like normal wasabi. I've tried real ones in Japan and this was definitely not it.   I enjoyed the seafood hotpot tapa, they have a giant butter bar placed into the soup, it's quite flavourful but lacks a lot of meat. There was so much cabbage at the bottom.   The other dish we got was the chicken and Omelete bowl which was pretty disappointing, the soup lacked a lot of flavour and the Omelete was..... Just thin shreds of egg."}
{"text":"Walk in and you'll be hear the usual loud yells of the izakaya staff. Still, this place wasn't that full on a Friday night, so it's not too loud all the time like busier izakaya-style restaurants. The service was friendly and very quick. They came back very often and the food came quickly. Now on to the food.  Hits: Takoyaki - Soft and delicious takoyaki! They do top it off with bonito flakes, but they could put a bit more octopus inside.  Chicken Karaage - That is some delicious, tender chicken! I love the way they fry it. My only complaint is that they only give you some salt/pepper to flavour it. \"Spicy dipping sauce\" was an extra $1.50.  I assumed they would give you some sort of regular sauce at least. Nope. It just comes off as a money grab to me... like charging plum sauce for spring rolls or ketchup for fries.  Beef Sukiyaki - This dish is very sweet but I still liked it. They give you a generous amount of beef, veggies and eggs. Udon was an extra $3. and they barely give you any!   Misses: Tuna tataki - Not the best tataki I've had. The flavour wasn't there, but the fish was pretty fresh.  This is one of the few places in the area that offers Japanese food that's not typical or sushi. And the food is not too shabby! The only drawbacks are those little charges they tack on for things that should not be an extra charge in the first place."}
{"text":"My now favorite restaurant! Was here before a movie, friendly environment, the server was attentive, the moment I drop my chopstick, out of nowhere waitress pops up with another pair! The dishes are great, but I was more impressed with the fresh fish of the day, it was the shrimp sashimi in shells... In the beginning, I was in awe, dammit, this is it? But once I start, I couldn't stop, the shrimp so fresh and sweet, completely ignoring my date until it's done, save the shrimp heads as they deep fried it later on, so crispy and tasty."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night around 8:30pm.  Still bustling, not crazy busy, but there were lots of other people there still.  I really enjoyed all the dishes ordered!  As for ambiance, it looks just like a regular Japanese restaurant, so not the crazy loudness of Guu, but the food was great.  The skewers (especially pork belly) were really succulent, all the tuna dishes were the perfect temperature (cool, not cold, frozen or warm) and prepared great when by themselves, or in a sauce.  The only thing is the service is kind of slow: the servers don't really check on you to see if you want more food, tea, etc.  So if you're looking to have a quick meal, I doubt you'll be able to do that here.  But as far as the quality of the food, I thought it was great."}
{"text":"If you want a late night snack, this cute little izakaya opens till 11PM...  Loud like any other izakaya, the staff here are nice and friendly. There's more to choose from than Guu and the seating is more comfortable.   Loved their eggplant dish, blowtorched markarel and their lychee juice. Try the sake flight if you're in for some sampling.... The Ontario sake is borderline mediocre but the rest is quite good."}
