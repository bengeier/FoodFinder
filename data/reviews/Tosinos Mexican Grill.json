{"text":"Best Mexican food hands down. Staff is friendly and the prices are very cheap. Try the carne asada torta y carne asada burrito. And the horchata!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting tosinos since I started working across the street. Recently my manager sent in an employee to pick up an order of three burritos. Two with meat and one without meat because my manager is a vegetarian. Receipt said no meat on one of the burritos. Sadly there was meat on all three. So my manager called in and simply just asked if his order could be fixed. Instead of keeping a loyal customer and just fixing the problem, they chose to tell my manager that he is wrong. That he was lying just to get a free meal out of them. We order about 5 burritos a day and this is how you treat loyal customers. Won't be earning my business anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the lower ratings. There was a peculiar non food smell when I entered the restaurant. There were just plastic plates and utensils. The restaurant appeared to be clean, however it was a very sterile atmosphere. I had chicken enchiladas with rice and beans, chips and salsa. The rice had some corn green beans and peas in it but with very little flavor. The refried beans were bland. The chicken and ingredients appeared to be fresh however there was very little flavoring to the ingredients. Overall it was a rather bland affair"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I go here once or twice a week. My favorite meal is the crispy taco combo (#4).  I get it with chicken instead of beef. The carne asada burrito is also really good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious the carne asada tacos have a fresh taste to it with the pico de gallo and guacamole added to it!!"}
{"text":"My family gets food from Tosinos often, and last night my dad picked up some for dinner. I got a Chile reanno burrito. I took 3 bites and started to feel sick. I thought it could have been from something else so I put it away and laid down. Now today, I'm writing this from my bed. I ate the rest for lunch and I feel so sick to my stomach. I've only gotten food poisoning from a restraunt once before and this feels exactly like it. I've been in bed for hours and am miarible."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast and pleasant service. I love great small business family restaurants and this is so good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to eat Mexican food! I went there after getting a hair cut and bought some stuff to go. My fiancé loved the food! The beans taste home made so does everything else. I dragged my brother there next time he said it was meh but the tongue taco amazing! One thing is it's kind of like creepy quite and takes a while for the food to come out. They need some decor help it's kind of awkward eating there due to how silent it is. But if you want good food at a great price I would go here."}
{"text":"Wish this place had menus posted or a website but we tried it & we're happy with the results. Tried several dishes & very pleased with the food. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING, my girlfriend and I ate like kings and really enjoyed the food. Absolutely delicious, a hidden gem in the East Valley. We will be back to try their breakfast burrito for sure!   #musttry!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here since it opened and have loved it since. The chimichanga's are really good as well as the rolled tacos. It's been the same cashier since I've been going there she's very nice and helpful. Overall really great place a definite must try!"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing food and staff. Reasonable prices and plenty of parking. We love the carne Adams fries. They're a huge portion so make it a meal and you're good to go. We share it amongst 4 people. The churro a are good as well as the tamales. We can not get enough of this place."}
{"text":"We get breakfast burritos here at least once a week. Their Salsa Verde is terrific. We have eaten most things on the menu and were never disappointed."}
{"text":"When they have lengua and Cabesa on the menu you know you are in the right place.   Straight up this is some good classic Mexican food. Street tacos, fresh made orders and friendly staff. Great prices help as well.   I will definitely keep coming back here. I usually get the Tacos al pastor and am very satisfied. Daughter gets pollo asado burrito and she loves it.   Really if you are looking for a great Mexican place this is it. It isn't fine dining and no table service but is tasty tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are awesome Cheese quesadilla is huge Carne asada tacos are ok. Comes with guac Guacamole is awesome Rice is awesome too"}
{"text":"MUST TRY!!! i went there today because i was craving carne asada fries, but ended up getting the carne asada nachos. \"Super Nachos\". AMAZING!! the tostada chips are made fresh! everything tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great authentic Mexican food. One of the best I've had since moving to Arizona. The quality and taste of food is on point. The chicken burrito is awesome!"}
{"text":"Super good food and it's family owned/operated so the service was great. The perfect combination if you dig supporting small businesses. Do it."}
{"text":"I would've given a 5 star, but the cleanliness isn't always up to par. The food is delicious. The price is very good for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Have been here 6/7 times and have loved it every time.  Chimi was excellent, but I come back for the carnitas and fish tacos!  Also, the guac is great and the hot red pepper sauce in the salsa bar...starting to become a regular!  Oh yeah, they have perfect ICE"}
{"text":"Oh man, their breakfast burritos are so good!!  Love them. Right now I'm mackin' on a carne asada burrito and loosing my mind!  So good!  I love the red sauce, my husband loves the green. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I just have to say that I REALLY like this place, I'm from Mexico City and believe me I've been in many many places of Mexican Food, Tosinos is the real thing!! the quality is fabulous, the  portions are generous, the place is nice and clean, and the owners are very friendly. I'm just very happy that it's just few minutes away from where I leave. Did I say that they close at 11?? Yeah!!"}
{"text":"I had the egg cheese and potato breakfast burrito and my daughter had the egg cheese potato and bacon breakfast burrito, we absolutely loved them, not to mention the salsas."}
{"text":"Great food and price point . This was our first time here, but after the first bite all 3 kids asked if this can be our new go to Mexican food place. We ordered bean and cheese burrito, cheese quesadilla, carne asada tacos, and rolled tacos. My kids and I enjoyed all of it.  I especially liked the flavor of the beans. My 8yr old son proclaimed this is his new favorite place. The food wasn't greasy. We did add a bit of salt to the rolled tacos but I usually do that. I will definitely tell my friends and family give this place a try"}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food. You can smell the salon next door. I had the chimichanga. It comes with more veggies than I wanted but it was good. We would go there again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos in AZ!  Very consistent and great food, hot sauce and quick service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Finally a taco shop in my area with flavor!!! I've ate at most of the taco shops in the east valley and I would either drive to Phoenix or Scottsdale to get decent taco shop food! Ladies working there were nice and it was priced great. I will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Tried other places MY MISTAKE they all are gross! Still the best place to go and still the ONLY place I will continue to go back to! If you haven't been and are thinking about giving it a try, please do! Amazing food amazing quality you don't be disappointed, you will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Food is good, not great but the super nachos (carne asada add pastor) are better than other places. Sucks that they got rid of the salsa bar, so no reason at all to eat in unless you REALLY don't like being at home. No ambience and there's always a weird sulfuric smell, but the place is clean. Service is mediocre and they are often out of stuff like tonight- no pastor :(."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed their food.  I had the carne asada burrito and my hubby had the mini tacos.  They use fresh tortillas instead of store bought ;).we will definitely be coming here again!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Best service and the food is delicious! Their carne asada is always well cooked and not oily which I love!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I gave this place a chance.. I wanted some good Mexican food. The food here reminds me of my mom's cooking. Great place! Very clean! Enjoyed my sopes with carne asada! Super yummy!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Carne Asada Burrito as many people suggested on the yelp reviews. It was only $4.75 and was big enough to share between 2 people. However meat was excessively salty and did not taste very savory. It's a good, cheap deal but quality wise wasn't amazing. We also ordered the guac and chips which was definitely my favorite part. The guac is drizzled over light, crispy chips. Guac was great and chip weren't oily. Also got a Pastor mini taco.   I wish there wasn't such excessive cabbage in it because it covered the taste of the meat.   Also wish the salsa bar had more choices!"}
{"text":"Only been in here twice. Def gonna make a third, fourth and more. I got a crunchy chicken taco that was so good, with green peppers. So savory. Also a bean tostada with guacamole. Simple yet delicious! Nice quiet atmosphere, a little salsa bar and my food was out quick!"}
{"text":"Good food and fast service from this one.  Breakfast burrito is on par with the best in the area.  Kids love the Carne Asada Fries as well as the Tosinos Fries."}
{"text":"Cute, clean, order at the counter place. Everything was fresh. Best shrimp taco I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Small quiet joint. I got their chorizo breakfast burrito and it was good standard fair. The chips are fried there and super fresh! Of their two sauces I preferred the green over the red - it seemed more flavorful."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and thought I would check this place out. I love Mexican food and thought that this place did a decent job. I thought it was very similar to Filibertos, nearly identical although not as greasy. I thought the prices were also a bit less. The chile verde, cheese quesadilla, rice, beans & taquitos were all very good. I will be back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Wow, what a surprise.Had a chicken chimi, burros and tacos. All were great. Service was excellent. Will be back for sure. Mesa support your local business."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious and so affordable. I spent $6.25 and had one of the best Chile Relleño's of my life and some really delicious rice. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"It would be 5, but their is no ambiance.  Except the picture of the old Mexican couple.  Stare at it and you will see... You Cannot go wrong with their food:  Authentic, fresh, abundant and absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Wow - wow - and wow - this place has care in preparation - clean clean fast causal eat in restaurant - 3 rolls tacos with cheese and guacamole,nachos, breakfast burritos are to die for - I consider this the top of fast Mexican food joints better than los fav's, filibertos, burrito express combined - Gilbert has a gem of a fast casual Mexican restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor... GO HERE. Get the super nachos and a large horchata. Absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices great customer service  There's a good variety of menu items and everything is cooked to order the way you like it at the time the order is placed but the wait time is still short and the food is consistently good"}
{"text":"We moved here from California and have been having a tough time finding good Mexican food until we tried this place. We drive from Queen Creek just to go here. The food is delicious, prices are decent and the employees are super friendly. Definitely try the tamales. They are delicious. Not like your regular tamales. They have sauce poured all over them. Also recommend the chimichangas and California burritos!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food here is absolutely delicious and the prices are fantastic! That portion gets 5-stars from me.   The reason for the 3-star review is because of the restaurant experience. The temperature was very uncomfortable in the restaurant. The fans were on but it didn't feel like there was any air movement. In addition to this the tables, while aesthetically pleasing, are not very functional. The plates slip and slide on the surface which makes cutting your food a challenge.   TL;DR The food is great, but get it to go."}
{"text":"The made my order fresh and fast! I picked it up to-go and I couldn't be more pleased. The Cheese Enchilada was phenomenal and the Rice and Cheesy Beans were the perfect touch. Thank you!"}
{"text":"First time here and I wanted some good oh carne asade fries. The service was quick and friend, fries nice and crispy and the meat hot! Not happy how chewy the meat was for $9 asade fires, and the red sauce taste like spicy water; literally spicy tap water at that. I wouldn't mind trying other foods, but different meat and entree next! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican Food ... Def recommend yummy street tacos. Chicken tacos like back home in San Jose"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews and gave it a try. Great selection and the burrito I ordered was awesome. Flavorful with some good sauces to chose from.  Quick service was a bonus."}
{"text":"I picked this place to meet some extended relatives for dinner while they were in town, based on the location and their request for Mexican food. We were less than impressed. We came for dinner and there were NO shades on the windows, so most of the tables were un-usable due to the sun pouring in and blinding one side of the table. The menu doesn't really clarify what's in anything, and some of the items are a little weird (a Carne Asada burrito, for example, is simply carne asada, guacamole and pico - no rice, beans or anything else). The lack of alcohol was a bummer as well. I thought based on the reviews that this place was bigger than it is, and more of a waiter-service style, but that's my bad for not paying attention. I doubt that we'll be back."}
{"text":"We went here based upon the 4.5 star reviews. I don't think it was deserving. It was good, nothing special. The food was fresh and the place was clean. But it was a little over priced. We got the shrimp tacos, bean and cheese burrito, carne asada tacos and chips and guacamole. Basically it was a cleaner less greasy Filiberto's."}
{"text":"the food is good, but the customer service is completely null and void.  this place seems to be trying to go out of business,  i have never been so upset leaving a restaurant ever in my life.  here is what i don't understand that hopefully someone can change, when i take off the expensive items like guacamole, and the pico, and ask to replace them with lettuce and cheese-can you please figure out a way to not make the taco $1.10 more expensive????????  PLEASE!!!!!"}
{"text":"A-OK is right! I probably would have went 3.5 if they had better salsa options.  The burrito was pretty good, solid flour toritilla with the right amount of \"puff\".  The Carne asada wasn't super tender but also wasn't gristley.  The rest of the filling were pretty good quality.  Everything tasted fresh and had decent flavor.  I would go back."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. We discovered it 3 years ago when we moved to the area. The customer service is always wonderful,  the food is always hot, and the salsas on the side are delicious. Whenever we want Mexican food that won't cost too much, we come here."}
{"text":"Burritos are good but they gave my son and I food poisoning. My husband didn't eat any and he isn't sick. :("}
{"text":"We just moved from Utah and were looking for a mexican restaurant similar to all the \"Betos\" style restaurants found there. Tosinos was far better than any of those, and the breakfast burritos (served all day) were excellent. The burritos are plenty big, and one usually fills me up while my wife usually only eats half of one at a sitting. All ingredients were evidently fresh, and the staff was great. I got quesadillas for our boys which they devoured quickly, then saved the contact info in my phone for fast convenient ordering in the future!"}
{"text":"Loved the food. I have been a few times and every item I have ever ordered is fresh, hot and really good. Only complaint is my cabesa mini tacos were average. I like more substance to my cabesa tacos. Other than that, DELICIOSO. Great salsa, clean restaurant, friendly staff. Oh... And their dishes can be made Gluten-free! Yay for Celiac friendly restaurants!!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and ecstatic to find an authentic Mexican restaurant on the first try. The food was delicious, good quality meat and portions. My family and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Even though Mesa's part of the greater Phoenix metro, a bastion of Mexican-American cooking in the Southwest, the city doesn't have as many good restaurants as you might otherwise expect. With as much Mexican food as there is to be found around here, I'm not even looking for a mind-blowing experience so much as I am just a solid place to get some tacos, and by that rubric Tosinos fits the bill. Open late, fast, and cheap. They've pared down the meat selection, so carnitas and carne asada are the deepest cuts you're going to find, but they're tender, juicy, and are offered in portions almost too big for the little three-inch tortillas. With a side of taquitos it hits the spot."}
{"text":"This place makes some really good mexican food, and the salsa is soooo good . Diffently worth the stop."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is okay. I'm sure it's a nice lunch spot for businesses in the area, it wasn't the sit down place that it appeared to be. The staff wasn't very helpful with suggestions or directions and I probably won't be going back. There were a few things I didn't like, they served their guacamole on a bed of chips instead of in a bowl, which made them soggy. They used a pre made guacamole, which sucked. We had to ask them to put ice in the ice machine. Over all it wasn't a great experience. I'd pass on it and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great little place! Supper fresh food and delicious, best in Phoenix Mexican food! Can recommend for lunch for everyone, l was confuses with inside atmosphere, looks like fast food, but food super, exceeded all expectations!"}
{"text":"Good food, a step up above filibertos is my best description. A little over priced but definite detail and attention the each item. I'll be back to try other menu items"}
{"text":"My favorite Place .. Will not go back to Filibertos ever.. This place real Mexican food always made fresh never greasy or old food or over cooked..Friendly staff"}
{"text":"it was average.  food was good, fresh but nothing overly special.  Portions were a bit small though.  I'd go there if I lived close, but not worth an extra drive for.  You won't be disappointed here but you won't be wowed either."}
{"text":"Quick update - just got home & had their carnitas - it's THE BEST!!!   Great location & good food!  Dining area is basic but I get my dinner to go.  Definitely give em a try.  I am pretty sold on the enchiladas.  My wife gets 2 if the mini tacos if you like the \"street taco\" style tacos.  No kids sized stuff though.  Wanted to get a small quesadilla for the kiddo - only 1 size unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is the second time my husband and I have eaten here and it is fabulous.  It's very clean and the food is fresh and delicious.  We've come for breakfast burritos both times and can't wait to come back for dinner.  You've got to try it."}
{"text":"Stopped off from the airport from returning from Las Vegas (which has great food).   This food is delicious and I recommend the carne asda burrito. It was a little hot as I didn't have cheese with it, and it was amazing. Just as good as anything in Vegas and will return here again in the future.   Great food hidden away in Mesa."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I have loved every in I have tired. The chicken tacos are one of my favorites. Everyone should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Quite magnificent.  Too bad its in a low traffic zone, cars will pass by this place unknowing to what lies beyond the front doors.  Absolutely awesome."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a strange smell when you walk in, however, I wouldn't let the odor take you away from the excellent customer service and food quality. We bought a carne asada plate and chicken enchiladas. Absolutely delicious and well plated for us. Definitely recommend it for anyone looking for Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"We recently went here to try some nearby Mexican food and fell in love! We've come back 3 times in a few days. We really like the carne asada burrito and the breakfast burritos! Superb! Also the customer service is great. The employees are nice and bring your food out on a tray with not one, but two salsas! And I do love my salsa! One complaint is that there is some wall art or maybe a sign that reads \"salsa bar\" but there is none in sight. Oh well, we are really digging in this place and will keep going again and again."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the exterior!  The food is terrific!  We had the cheese enchiladas, beef enchiladas and the hard tacos.  All were outstanding.  Derive was okay (no negatives but no glowing highlights)but doesn't speak strong English.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Better than Filibertos in all ways except the red chile sauce...something funny about the taste. Otherwise all is yummy. Wish they added more mini tacos which are more like street style tacos"}
{"text":"Ordered a Cane Asada Burrito and enjoyed it. Wasn't the best I have ever had but it was good. The staff was very nice and I would have rated higher but it was average. Nothing blew me away."}
{"text":"Friendly, clean, new, plain. Otherwise, the food reminded me of Filibertos/other fast Mexican food. I tried the taquitos, a tamale, and the quesadilla. The taquitos and the tamale were plain and unremarkable. The quesadilla was the biggest I've ever had...ha. Kinda difficult to eat. One positive is their salsa bar- I love fresh salsa. Bottom line: cheap, \"alright\"."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  The restaurant is small, a few tables and an open window to the kitchen. Not a \"fine dining experience\" but the FOOD IS DELICIOUS! Have had their combos... beans and rice were top notch. The ala carte menu is excellent. The BEST tacos I've ever had and their tamales are perfection! I ordered a tamale ala carte and it was HUGE, placed on a small bed of rice, smothered in sauce and shredded lettuce...a meal in itself for $3.05! My husband and I really love this restaurant and it has become our \"go to\" Mexican restaurant in the Warner and Gilbert Rds area. Hope it flourishes and leads to more of these great little restaurants!  Update: have been to Tosino's multiple times and the food quality and taste are CONSISTENT. Past experience has been that many of these independent restaurants lack consistency, but this restaurant remains 5 STARS for us!  Portions are huge. We ordered take-out the other day and got six meals out of a $26 order. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"We visited for lunch on a Friday. First time in.   The portions are big and the price is fair, but the beef is not flavorful. I ordered the rolled tacos (shredded beef) and my husband ordered the beef taco & burrito combo. Neither of us was impressed by the flavor. It was very bland.  My husband asked for a spicier or hot salsa to kick up the flavor, but the hottest salsa is the red one provided.  The rice was good. The cashier was friendly. Food was fast.  We've heard they have good breakfast burritos so we may come back to try those."}
{"text":"Place was dirty.  Food was average.  Nothing was bad, the carne asada was pretty good, but cheese was unmelted and cold in enchilada."}
{"text":"The food was pretty okay but the restaurant is based on a disposable economy that I abhor. Everything is served on plastic. There are no dishes and everything gets thrown away. The only way we can stop this kind if waste is refusing to eat in places that serve food this way. I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"First time here and it's so good! The tortillas are perfect. Food is cheap. Bf and I got breakfast burritos and chips & guac, all really fresh. Salsa has the pepper kick that I miss at most taco joints like this. Best hole in the wall Mexican fast food I've had since moving from Tucson."}
{"text":"Always eager to try new Mexican food, and this one definitely does not disappoint. I had a chicken burrito and it was very flavorful. The chips and salsa was what makes this place good. There are very few places that can match the salsa. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great carne asada tacos and Pico de gallo. Chips and guacamole were super fresh. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time....Yelp led me here. small place, very clean, very affordable. Impressed with the salsas! 2 green, 2 red. Food was very good and we will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"I had the carne Asada nachos! Pretty good, super loaded with carne Asada, beans, pico guac and sour cream n cheese! Shareable for sure! Place is small but cute and clean."}
{"text":"My fellow yelpers let me down!!  :-(  There is no way this is a 4.5-5 star place.  No way.  Not even close.  Go to La Tolteca and then try to tell me this is a 4-star joint.  Seriously.  I learned of this place because of restaurant.com.  I saw an offer there, so I came here to check them out.  I see 4.5 stars.  I'm thinking \"great!\".  So I snag the certificate.  We show up, and it's a hole in the wall.  Which is fine.  Some great food sometimes can be found in such places.  Inside was sort of divey.  Again, that's fine.  We both ordered combos.  I got the chimi (because I almost always do when checking out a new place), and my wife got the asada.  They apparently have only one chimi (beef).  I usually get chicken or machaca, but oh well.  Staff was friendly enough, so far so good.  The chimi was well-cooked.  The tortilla was light and crispy.  The one in the asada burro was fresh.  Again, so far so good.  But that's really where the goodness ended.  The chimi had basically no flavor.  And they did not provide any pico to put on it (they actually CHARGE for a tiny cup of pico).  The guacamole appeared to be fresh, but tasted like nothing more than mashed avocado.  It should have some zip to it.  It's more than just mashed avocado, but it sure didn't taste like it.  The asada burro was a bit better in flavor, but the meat was grisly.  Excessively so.  And the flavor was only marginally better than my chimi.  I would take this place over one of the national chains like Taco Bell, but there are so many better places than this that I can't see coming back here.  They weren't horrible, but \"meh, I've experienced better\".  For sure."}
{"text":"My wife found her new favorite chorizo breakfast burrito.  Great value.  Good balance of ingredients.  My chile verde burro was also excellent.  Service was quick and pleasant.  Restaurant seats maybe 25-30 people and was very clean. Salsas were very good but all had a spice to them.  I especially liked the house salsa.     Excellent food for fast casual.  Far better quality than Los Fav's or Burrito Express and just a $1 or so difference in price.  If they had a drive thru I bet this place would be extremely busy."}
{"text":"The beef in all their dishes here makes the difference. All Angus beef is noticeable from the first bite. The chicken crispy tacos are fabulous and the breakfast burrito can easily feed two. Nothing fancy sort of dated interior but the food is wonderful"}
{"text":"Stop in to try food the was great and fresh love this place will come back and very clean resturtion"}
{"text":"I've tried some amazing Mexican food down at San Diego and CA and I would have to say that Tosinos is pretty up in their game.   Absolutely loved their Carne Asada Fries and CA Burrito. I like how their fries are still crispy and not too drenched in the oil and sauce.   I want to try their Sopes next time!"}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly.  The food was great.  Maybe a little bit expensive for what we got but I would still recommend it.  Carna Asada nachos were huge BTW"}
{"text":"I came in here from a recommendation from a friend - and I HATE mexican food, absolutely can't stand any part of it.  BUT! The other people in my party really wanted to check it out so we did.  The service was friendly, the ambiance was kind-of fast food-ish, but still very well up kept and nice.  My food was terrific.  This coming from a person who hates mexican food, haha.  The other people in my party LOVED their food too.  Will definitely be looking forward to coming back. Job well done!!"}
{"text":"This place is BY FAR better than ANY other fast food Mexican restaurant in the valley. The BEST carne asada burrito I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food! The price is perfect and have tried all kinds of different things. Def carna asada burrito is a must. I've visiting this place several times and yet to find something that I do not like!"}
{"text":"This place is always exceptional! The carne asada is amazing! I'm pretty sure it's family owned because it's always the same people running the place. The service is great and they are very nice. My boyfriend is super picky and they are always patient with him and make sure to verify the order. It's hard to eat in house because of the nail place next door, there is a smell but they do to-go. Seriously delicious food and salsa though!!"}
{"text":"So excited!  This place is great :)  Fast, fresh, and friendly!!  My husband loved the Menudo!! My family will be back!"}
{"text":"The tamale was so good! I also tried the nachos and menudo. The ingredients are fresh and everything has a lot of good flavor."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and love this place!  I've had a lot of items on their menu-- burritos, tacos, and tortas--and I have enjoyed all of them.  I especially like that they have street tacos and my three favorite meats, lengua, cabeza, and al pastor.  I have to say that the al pastor is always delicious, while the lengua and cabeza have on occasion been a little dry, but are still good.  The asada burrito and steak breakfast burrito are also two of my favorites.  They have an option of ordering the burrito in supreme fashion with enchilada sauce on it, and it's delicious as well.  And I've had the torta before with all the meats on it except the fish, and I thought it was also quite tasty.  The pickled carrots here are flavorful and a little spicy, not bland like some of the other Mexican food places I've been to.  My one critique is their salsas. They are good but not amazing, and I think that the salsas really separate the 5-star restaurants from the 4-star."}
{"text":"We drive by this strip mall frequently so thought we'd try Tosinos.  Completely forgettable, average food that tastes like it might have been frozen.  We won't be back.  I recommend you drive up Power to McKillips and eat at Senior Tacos instead."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is always fresh and the cashiers are approachable and friendly."}
{"text":"Decent bean and cheese, but the cheese is cold and not melted. They use oil, supposedly, instead of lard so thats a plus. Green salsa is good, would be nice if served a small side of chips though,. Hard tacos good but way too much iceburg lettuce, it filled half the taco shell."}
{"text":"Very good shredded chicken quesadillas.  Nice hot red chili on the side.  They were prompt and did take out well.  The place was clean and staff helpful in ordering."}
{"text":"So all I've been hearing around town is how amazing this little Mexican joint is. I and the family decided to give it a shot. We ordered the $1.75 tacos... They lay less then normal amounts of meat. The salsa bar was nearly empty (my refrigerator at home has more salsa) the tacos came with cilantro and onion (needles to say it had more onion and three little leafs of cilantro) I asked for more cilantro and they said not we mix the cilantro and onion together and don't have any with out onion. What in the world?!?!?!? I've never heard of this. The customer service is horrible... The ladies in the back are rude and they have poor hygiene this place needs to get a random inspections constantly! I hope you don't get sick eating here!"}
{"text":"Smells weird. No drive - thru.  Honestly. I don't get what all the hype is for. To me it was like every other decent Los somethingbertos.   Food was as expected."}
{"text":"Just went and ordered for the first time. California burrito, menudo, tamales, and of course horchata. Restaurant inside was very clean, great service, and great quality food. Will be going back to try other items. So thankful Tosinos took the spot of Happy (Crappy) Joes."}
{"text":"I will not be the one that breaks this 5-star streak. Chorizo Breakfast Burrito (Boom!), Salsa Bar (BAM!), Super Nachos (Hello!), Chips+Guac (meh), Carne Asada in Burrito (shut up and feed me!)."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 star for me, but I'll round up this time! Bf and I were craving some Mexican food and found this spot only a mile away from my apartment. Thanks Yelp AZ for the recommendation!  Service: quick, it's a pick-up-serve-yourself kinda place. The guy at the cashier was sorta rude though, it was our first time there so we took a while deciding what to order, he was seemingly impatient, jeez.  Decor: not much, fairly clean, some tables were not cleaned right after patrons left though.  Food: this is when things started to look up for Tosinos  Carne Asada Tacos combo: OMGAH so delicious, the portion was generous and the meat was just sooooo tasty, full of flavors. Fish Tacos combo: my bf says he's had better, I think we'll just stick with the carne asada next time  SAUCE BAR: I'm obsessed with places that has sauce bar, it even comes with the little picked carrots and sliced turnips  Anyhow, not the best I've had, but I'll be back because of its proximity to where I live."}
{"text":"Excellent! Food is authentic and flavorful!Completely reminds me of my moms home cooked food. First time I tried the sopes and hard tacos, both delicious. On my 2nd visit I had the chili rojo and I was not disappointed, again super delicious!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican food joint. Portions are large and we have had tamale, enchilada, hard beef taco, Chile relleno, beans and rice. All were delicious. Highly recommend. This is small place with order window and a few tables. I recommend phone order and pick up."}
{"text":"Very very good. Very good Carne Asada. If you want authentic Mexican food you Must go here. It is a smaller place but everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"My first time here and I bought lunch for my coworkers. Simply amazing! I ordered the pollo asada burrito, the chicken is grilled and the burrito included guac at no extra charge. I'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Good sized portions and the meat is flavored quite close to what you would be expecting. Al pastor and asada are usually my go-tos and this place has these down pretty well. I agree with another reviewer that their salsas could use some improvement. The flavors aren't that amazing and not really that spicy either. Otherwise, this is a nice place to pick up a quick meal."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE food, extremely authentic and delicious. Service is terrible but food was so good I will be back. Carne Asada is amazing, get the California burrito! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here because I saw some good reviews on yelp! I seriously think these people need to try some real, good, legitimate Mexican food. Anyways. The food was mediocre. But the customer service was awful. I obviously look Polynesian but I grew up in the Spanish ghetto in Santa Ana, Ca. I can carry a decent conversation in spanish. I do not appreciate being spoken about in another language. Especially one I can fully comprehend. I was only polite because I didn't want them to spit or do something to my food. The ladies were rude, and your food is as fake as you are. Please save your money and try another place. Also the menudo was put together last minute. They charge you extra for little sides. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Really good, basic taqueria type food. Al Pastor is really good and I haven't had a bad thing there. Great rice and beans. I only wish they kept the salsa bar."}
{"text":"3.5/5  I was sadly a bit disappointed at my last visit here. It's been a few years since I ate here and unfortunately they took out that really nice salsa bar. They do give you bottles of red and green salsa with your order though, but it's just not the same if I can't also get those marinated carrots, onions and chiles.   I normally used to get the carne asada here but this time tried out the rolled tacos and had some of the chile verde plate. The rolled tacos had a generous topping of guac, lettuce and cheese but the tacos themselves were a bit chewy. The chile verde sauce was decent but a bit too tangy for me. The pork was tender, and the rice + beans were average.   Service is still friendly as always though, and it's still a decent choice for Mexican food if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Our first time checking this place out. We loved it! The burritos are great. The salsa was very tasty and the chips were fresh and hot. Yummy! Fresh made when you order it.   Give this place a try."}
{"text":"It was pretty good, a better version of Filibertos. The food was fresh and the use a higher quality of cheese than most Mexican restaurants I have eaten at. I think if they had a drive thru the would be more popular!"}
{"text":"Don't judge the food by the outside of the building. Looks very plain but once inside it is very nice and quant. Basic menu but very good flavors. The chips are made to order. Salsa station gives a few options and there is a very spicy version. The ice at the fountain drink station is the crushed version  that makes the drinks very cold. Will definitely return and explore the menu more."}
{"text":"This place is always clutch! Good good and good peeps! Whenever I'm in need of good authentic favors, this place always hits home with there food"}
{"text":"One of the best burritos in the valley.    Tongue Tacos?   Yes, please!  This little hole in the wall is great if you want to get some really great mexican food.  We love it every time we visit here."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the most amazing Mexican food I've had. Don't listen to all the other bland reviews. Those people don't have taste buds. The breakfast burritos are deadly delicious. The Carne Asada frys are intoxicating. The horchata is the bees' knees. YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE. TOO DAMN DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Authentic Mexican food that's fresh.  I ordered the carne asada tacos with rice and beans.  My husband ordered a chimichanga with carne asada meat.  The meat was delicious and fresh.  There salsa and homemade chips are awesome.  The resturant was clean and service was good.   If your a fan of Los Favoritos or other small restaurants like it you won't be disappointed.   There food gets 5 stars. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Really??? Read the reviews and just moving to this area we tried it!  Wow!!!! How disappointed we were.  The food, salsa, guacamole, chips were edible and just that!  No flavor, all the same sauce was used for the different dishes.  Can't believe people like this place?  Guess people will eat anything! Had to rate with 1 star."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. This is some of the best Mexican food I've had in a while. Definitely a new go to spot for me. Easy to miss driving past but my boyfriend and I left so full for like $20."}
{"text":"Gotta tell ya, I'm pleasantly surprised just how GOOD their food is!  It's becoming my go to for burritos, 2-3 times week.   Had the carne asada, carnitas and green chili. Carne asada is really good and comparable to Los Favoritos. Carnitas was good but a little dry, used generous portions of their homemade green sauce (very good).   But the GREEN CHILI is the BOMB!!  Big chunks of pork a very tasty green chili sauce. Very clean and fairly new (couple months) tucked back in a little neighborhood strip mall across parking lot fm Zipps."}
{"text":"Just got scolded by the restaurant for being so negative about their restaurant. Professional thanks!  Not EVERYONE has to like your food!"}
{"text":"Menudo is on point! Best since I've mobed here 15 yrs ago.  Fish taco amazballs.  I give it the Mexican seal of approval, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Fun little local spot with yummy Mexican food. It reminds me of my favorite place back home in the Bay Area. Food is fresh, tasty,  with just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"Pretty freakin good mex.  Think it's a notch above Senior Taco and a bit cheaper.  Good salsa.  Think the bar looks small because of how it is arranged, but still good.  My son ordered 4 hardshell tacos with nothing but lettuce and beef.   They got his order correct!  (yay) Worth the trip!  This cooking reminds me of my grandmother's style of Mexican.  There are many different types of \"authentic\" Mexican food, but this one has my vote, as it DEFINITELY reminds me of my Mexican grandmother's cooking."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Food is fresh and cooked perfectly. I have two shrimp taco.its hard to find a place with great salsa. Lol no further. It's yummy and spicy. Service was great as well. Super clean, quit, and for sure future to go spot."}
{"text":"I was excited to come check out Tosinos because I saw that they have a salsa bar. I was very disappointed to find out that it was taken out a year or two ago. They even still have signage up for it. The two salsas that came with my meal had little to no spice. Being an AZ Mexican restaurant I think they need to kick up the spice. That being said...the food was good. Fresh made taco shells are a bonus. They are worth the stop if you are in the neighborhood. No salsa bar for me though :-("}
{"text":"Really solid food, very clean restaurant. It's not too greasy like some other fast food Mexican places that can leave you feeling not so great afterwards. This building has struggled keeping restaurants in here even though they've all been good. Come support this place so we don't lose another small business fast food joint!! On the flip side, prices might be a tad high. Wouldn't mind some daily deals or coupons."}
{"text":"I drove by the place a few times in the last month, and decided to give it a shot. Walked in and it was very clean. Nice staff, the prices were average, and the food was great! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by and had lunch today.We were new to this area of town and thought we would try it out. Great Mexican food at a fair price.Would definately go there again.Clean and simple..Burito was excellent!"}
{"text":"Great food. We usually just have lunch here but today we went here for a breakfast. Their breakfast burritos  are delicious.  I will come here  for my breakfast burrito fix all the time now."}
{"text":"YUMTASTIC!! I LOVE THIS PLACE! The salsa that comes with the chips (not the red and green stuff), PHENOMENAL! Reminds me of my grandma's God rest her soul! Everything here is good, not AMAZING but kicks Filibertos ass!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty authentic. The rellenos are home made. If you want quick Mexican food this is a great place."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and great prices. We read the great reviews and decided to give it a try.  The tacos are amazing.  The carne asada fries are definitely a must have as well."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem that produces excellent food at very low prices. Their tacos are amongst the best I've ever had in Arizona and at $1.15 can't be beat. The food is incredibly fresh and seasoned perfectly. Everytime I come in I get excited at hearing the food sizzle on the griddle because I know it is going to be awesome. This place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices for the quality and quantity of food.  This place beats most sit down restaurants.  Highly recommend it! The burritos, tacos and enchiladas were enjoyed by our whole family.  The chips and special salsa are amazing."}
{"text":"If you want good authentic Mexican food.  This is the place to go.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Food is so good.  Everything is made fresh.  You will not regret coming here."}
{"text":"Tosinos is our go to place for Sunday breakfast. We usually get the menudo bowls and get a different breakfast burrito on each visit. So far no dissapointments. Cant wait for our next Sunday Tosinos fix."}
{"text":"Tosinos has a slight industrial feel with gray & red paint colors on the walls. Booths are gray, red & black. There are 7 4-tops & one 2-top. Plenty of room it seems. I was there at noon on a Saturday & half the booths were empty although lots of customers filtered in and out during the time I was there. There is artwork & mexican symbolism tossed about the dining area as well. On the day I was there one of the panels of the electronic menu was not working. I didn't realize this until later when I was looking at their printed menu and noticed a few more items that I didn't see listed up on the wall. I ordered the Carnitas Burrito ($5.15) & medium drink ($1.95). (The printed menu has older (lower) prices listed. It has the Carnitas Burrito at $4.75 and a medium drink at $1.80). Maybe once they run out they'll print up some new ones with correct pricing. The burrito itself was large & filled with nicely seasoned pork (moist & not to salty), pico de gallo & guacamole. The tortilla had good texture and flavor. Winner winner great burrito dinner. The soda machine is old school. It does not have that many selections, certainly fewer than most of the soda machines you find in restaurants with self serve sodas. Clean dining area, broken menu panel, fair prices, great burrito, fewer soda selections than I'm used to. 3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and got a California burrito and it was great! Carne asada, fries, cheese, onions and cilantro. That's all I want from my Cali b and that's what I got! I had there red salsa with it and it was pretty good, not amazing. I actually dont think that they have a salsa bar, I had to ask for what I wanted. Overall pretty pleased, will go again when I want another California burrito. My favorite taco shop is still Señor Taco in Mesa, the best salsa bar and carnitas *drools*. But Tosinos is closer."}
{"text":"It's just your generic Mexican food. Nothing special about it but it's not bad ether.   Also they don't have a paper towel dispenser or hand blow dryer in the men's bathroom."}
{"text":"Our family loves Tosinos! We've eaten in and taken out, and the service is always quick! The staff is friendly and accommodating. Our food has always been great. We've tried the Carne asadas fries, the Super nachos, bean and cheese burrito, quesadilla, California burrito, and torta. My husband thinks cream should be included on the torta, which was his only complaint, but otherwise it's yummy. The meat is always yummy, even our 11 month old like it! The store is always clean, which is a must! It's definitely a place we'll continue to frequent as long as we live in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Would highly recommend! Their tacos are perfectly crispy and have just the right amount of ingredients :D and their burritos are perfect as well! Not over stuff, not lacking, just right! The tortillas were sturdy and had a very nice flavor  I will definitely be returning! And also they are very kind with the sauce! My husband always complains when we go to McDonald's and he asks for a lot of sauce packets and they only give him like 2 D: we were given like 6 from here! Thank you"}
{"text":"Walked in and saw one couple at a booth.  Then I walk in.  Not a good feeling.  Cashier spoke so fast I couldn't understand if she was helping me or telling me to leave.  I had to ask her twice whenever she said something.  Ordered one \"Two Cheese Enchilada\" combo and one \"Two Chili Rellenos\" combo.  After ordering, cashier informed me, we gots only 1 chili rellenos.  I said throw in a chicken enchilada and I'm good.  The enchilada sauce must be made from gold.  The enchiladas were so frickin dry.  More much warmer enchilada sauce and hotter food would be nice.  At $8.00 per dish, I'll do Macayo's ANY day.  While I will pay 50% more, the food will be 500% better.  Tosinos WILL NOT be in business long if making a customer return is not in their plan.  Right now the customer is not wanted back according to what they serve us.  Save your money.  I don't know about you...but I HATE being screwed for my $$.  Buh-bye."}
{"text":"Disappointed. 3 of the 6 sodas were out of order. They were also out of the carrots and two of the taco meats were gone too."}
