{"text":"I know why they call it Happy Joe's- because I left happy lol. For real though, I was sad before getting there and my frown was flipped upside down hahahhaa! All kidding aside, it really did make my dull day brighter LMAO! The pizza was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Just like I remembered!!  Soooo perfect.  We got the Canadian bacon with extra cheese!!  Perfectly cooked and ready when I got there!  You have to try this place!!!!"}
{"text":"So happy we found out this was here!!  I have great childhood memories of Happy Joe's and love having one near where I'm settled now.  We come for the lunch buffet and they do such a great job of keeping new and fresh items on the buffet.  And of course it's the same great pizza I remember from so long ago!"}
{"text":"Tastes very good especially the taco pizza. Tastes the same as I was used to in Iowa.  I'm going to try the pasta next.time."}
{"text":"Best Taco Pizza you will find anywhere. Just found out yesterday that there was a Happy Joes 5 miles from us here.  Went right away and got a large taco pizza for the 2 of us. Soooo good. Had been years since having this Pizza back in Ames, Ia. Love it."}
{"text":"So happy to have Happy Joe's in AZ! MN transplant and almost paid $150 in shipping fees to have a Taco Pizza sent for my mom's birthday on year. She was thrilled when we received our order yesterday. I only gave it 4 stars because it's so dang small and feels more like a fast food joint than the family restaurant that I remember and loved so much about it."}
{"text":"Holy cow! I've been looking for breakfast pizza since Red Baron stopped making it 10 years ago. You guys weren't even open for delivery when I called, and still delivered an INCREDIBLE 3 meat omelette pizza anyway. Thank you! I will DEFINITELY be ordering from you guys again!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza.  Taco pizza wasn't as spicy as I was hoping.  Pepperoni was good.  Meatsa Pizza was too much on the toppings.  Pretty basic restaurant on the inside.   It did exceed my expectations and I will be back."}
{"text":"I am originally from Iowa and I have missed my taco and BLT pizza from Happy Joes. I found this Happy Joe's and it's just like back home! Great staff!!"}
{"text":"Preordered a pizza at 1 pm for 6:15 pm take out. They were very understaffed and way behind. My pizza was left on warming rack in the chaos and was given to me warm at 6:45. They did make a new one for me after I complained and left at 7 pm for valentines dinner. May be my last time here..."}
{"text":"TACO PIZZA!!! Happy Joe's is the place to go for the best Taco Pizza along with many other specialty pizzas to choose from along with the original favorites too. Great customer service and clean, family friendly environment. First time here but will definitely be back often! Go get a slice, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I grew up with Happy Joe's Pizza from my home town of Davenport Iowa.  The folks that started the location in Gilbert are doing a great job at providing a warm inviting environment and the same high quality food I am use to from back home.  I know they are working on expanding and I can't wait to see where that takes them. Terry Day"}
{"text":"Great pizza, just like i remember. I tried a little of everything and liked it all. Everything is clean and fresh. Staff is overwhelmed  but super nice and they really want to get you everything you need. When people come in with a party of 12 how could they not be overwhelmed! They definitely handled well in my opinion and kept smiling! No complaints here."}
{"text":"I really tried to like this place. We ordered the meat works as well as the sweet chili wings recommended by a worker. The meat works had no desirable taste, seems the dough is frozen. It came to us warm but not hot as you'd expect out of the oven, relatable as eating pizza that has been in room temperature out for hours. The sweet chili wings were soggy and warm as if sitting out as well.  The gentleman who took our order was pleasant, and that is about all the positive we have to say.   With prices so high compared to the amount of food you'd receive from competitors in Gilbert and with food not reflecting quality.. we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Pizza is personal.  I get it.  Just like religion for many.  My personal opinion:  Crust is pretty good though thinner than I like.  Sauce not so good (I prefer tangy and flavorful) it was sweet to me.  Toppings were average.  I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"We've been thinking of trying this place out ever since they moved in. Tonight my husband picked up two orders of wings, one with spicy joe sauce and the other with bbq sauce. Also ordered the pasta ( macaroni) which came with some delicious cheesy bread. Thankfully, because that was the best part of the meal. Upon opening the wings, one order was bone dry and sauce less and the other barely had any either. The pasta was covered in cheap tasting cheese and drowning in tasteless tomato water. It all went into the garbage after we sampled everything."}
{"text":"Today was our second time coming for the lunch buffet. The first time we came , the workers were so attentive and asked me if I wanted a vegetarian pizza. The food was great ajd never empty  Today was not the same. We paid for the buffet ands there was barely any food. We were there for a while after asking for pasta ajd cheese pizza to be refilled. The worker was so rude and didn't seem to care. The worker seemed high and disinterested in our wants. We had barely any food and what we did was the pizza that was sitting out for a while. The pasta was never replaced until we were walking out. There r so many lunch buffets that are cheaper and actually have food. Very disappointed in our service today."}
{"text":"The Hawaiian with pan crust and Taco pizza was very yummy. I really enjoyed the pizza sauce on the Hawaiian pizza. The prices was reasonable and service was friendly."}
{"text":"I chose one star because zero isn't an option. It's as if the delivery driver picked up the worst frozen pizza available at the grocery store and heated it on his engine block on the ride over.   Joe is happy because he collected my money before I tasted his awful pizza. Do yourself a favor and buy a totino's party pizza for $1 at the store. You'll have a much more enjoyable dinner.   Maybe a better name for this place moving forward would be Crappy Joe's."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Pizzas from here last Saturday night and we were so disappointed!  The original thin crust pizza was not very \"thin\", the second one was Pan crust and both were under cooked and gooey.  The boys eat theirs because they were hungry, I threw mine in the trash and made myself a sandwich."}
{"text":"LOVE Happy Joe's.. Best BLT and Tac pizza ever.... So happy it is finally here in Arizona. My kids had many Birthday parties at Happy Joe's growing up in Iowa.... If you've never had it, it is a MUST! Welcome to Arizona...."}
{"text":"All I can say is the taco pizza was DELISH!!!!  Grew up in the Quad Cities and we missed it so much!  What a treat!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas.. The taco pizza was excellent. However ordered a large sausage n sausage was non existence. Tasted more like a cheese pizza. Planning on trying wings next"}
{"text":"This pizza was AWFUL.  We asked for delivery and than they called us and stated they didnt have the staff to deliver so my husband had to go pick it up and mind you they stated they had no meatballs! Really? This is what I got stuck with  can't attach a pic maybe they don't want anyone to know how bad their food sucks  Happy Joe's you will NEVER get my business again"}
{"text":"Totino's is probably the closest comparison I could think of. For those who don't know Totino's is an extremely cheap and pretty awful tasting frozen pizza brand. But at least they know they're cheap and price accordingly. Happy Joe's is way more expensive than places like Pizza Hut and Dominos and can't match their quality. Just look at the photos on here, not appetizing.   Side note: I've noticed that the majority of the people who like this place have mentioned that they grew up on this food in the Midwest. As someone who was born and raised in the Midwest this embarrassed me. Let's have higher standards please."}
{"text":"What an amazing taste of back home (Iowa).   I first heard about this place opening here some time ago. Had not even really planned on going tonight but let me tell you it made me very nostalgic.   It was the same great taste of back home but without the atmosphere! At that's an amazing thing! Because most of the places back home are family type places with games and stuff for the kid that sometimes you feel you are at a Chuck E Cheese! I liked that it was basic and had that same pizza taste of the taco pizza I remembered from growing up!   I would be honored to go back to this quant little place!"}
{"text":"Sauerkraut on pizza. Its awesome. A bit of small town Iowa nostalgia.  Yes, the pizza isnt the best ever, but it is definitly better than most chain pizza (Peter Piper, Dominios, Papa Johns (ugh),  etc). And the lunch buffet is a deal."}
{"text":"Went today to try a new Pizza Chain here in Gilbert, pretty much around the corner from my house. Went for the lunch buffet. For $7.00 including a fountain drink, you can't go wrong. The Taco pizza that everyone talks about is amazing, especially with the taco sauce that you can put on it, makes you want more. For a real treat try the BLT pizza Bacon, (2 types) lettuce and tomato, with mayonnaise for the sauce. It sounds crazy but it is beyond delicious. I recommend you try this pizza. They also have BBQ Chicken nuggets on the buffet and The owner was awesome, he was like whatever you want, if it's not on the buffet I'll make it for you. REALLY? an owner saying he'll make anything you want on the menu or not. That was awesome. Very friendly owner strives to make his guests happy. It was a great experience. The only drawback is the buffet is limited from 11:00 - 1:30 but he made sure to accommodate those people that arrived right before the cut off time and told them to take their time and eat and AGAIN said if they need anything to ask him and he'll take care of it. I 100% recommend this place and WILL be back."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open as I have read great things & the pictures looked so good! When we opened up the box there were bubbles in the crust (which is usually a sign of cheaply made pizza)...except this pizza is far from cheap. I also felt like there was nothing special about it...pretty flavorless. Very disappointed. We got a pepperoni/mushroom/sausage pizza. There are much better places for the money!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, if you aren't from the Midwest you probably won't love happy joes.  But this pizza like many have said brings back memories of being a kid and having \"taco pizza\", which back then there wasn't a wide spread pizza trend like there is now, with places like Oregono's, Fired Pie, and others.  The taco pizza is amazing.  Be sure to add the hot sauce and understand it takes time for things worth waiting for!  I love it!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from uber eats deluxe chicken taco salad, came with no chicken, no ranch, no sour cream literally came without half the toppings I ordered. Also ordered a marinara pasta with linguine but came with shell pasta instead. I don't usually complain about my orders but this restaurant screwed everything up!"}
{"text":"That first bite of taco pizza was like taking a trip back to my childhood. The exact recipe as the midwest pizza chain.....they nailed it. PLUS, I couldn't be happier that they are a mile down the street from me.  If you grew up on this pizza like I did, this Happy Joes will not disappoint.  TACO PIZZA ABSOLUTELY RULES! This will now be the sole reason I work out each week. I work out so I can gorge myself once a week on their pizza."}
{"text":"A two topping 12 inch pizza that cost $18 better be amazing! Nope, delivered cold, over priced, and mediocre taste and quality.  Similar taste to a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We just moved here about 6 months ago from Davenport the home of Happy Joes. We were thrilled to find out this had just opened.  Love that  they had lunch buffet on a Sunday.  It allowed us to get all our favorites: Canadian Bacon and Sauerkraut aka Happy Joes Special, Taco Joe and even a breakfast pizza!  They were super accommodating with special requests and even bring your request out to your table so you can get a slice first. We live about an hour away but we will be back.  Love my little slice of Iowa in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Spur of the moment we decided to try the Gilbert Happy Joe's. Feeling nostalgic about all the years I worked at the Bettendorf and in college the Waterloo & oskaloosa Happy Joe's.  We arrived to a near empty restaurant. A little worried we went ahead and ordered a Taco Joe Pizza. Be sure to order on line for a discount!!  We didn't but next time. The pizza came out hot and delicious. So many great memories came flooding back. Yum!  Thanks for a good first experience."}
{"text":"Great new pizza chain from Iowa.  My kids loved the pizza, cheese bread, boneless wings and cinnamon dessert pizza.  The ownership is great.  Service was friendly and helpful.  This apparently is the first store in Arizona."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! First of all it was ridiculous expensive... 2 large pizza's and wings $55.00. More  expensive than 2 XL Rosati's pizza's. I don't mind cost of Rosati's because it is excellent and made with fresh mushrooms verses the canned mushrooms we had on our pizza tonight. The pizza was loaded with lettuce and soggy.  The crust was tasteless and as previously stated. The wings were so soggy & drenched with sauce. I am from the Midwest and we never had pizza this bad. I can honestly say I would rather have Little Caesars or even frozen pizza. I should have trusted the previous reviewer that stated consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"Service was good. I ordered the taco supreme pizza to give the place a try. They said 25 minutes and it was ready when promised.  The pizza itself was pretty unremarkable,  no flavor to the crust, not much in the way of any sauce,  lots of lettuce, and the \"taco chips\" were pretty stale.    I will give them another try for a standard pizza and I will give them a try for some wings.  If it is markedly better, update the review."}
{"text":"All ingredients including the dough is frozen. The pizza lasts about 10 minutes before it starts to taste like 3 week old leftovers that haven't been refrigerated."}
{"text":"Was in the area so decided to stop and check it out I personally like the lunch buffet. Good selection"}
{"text":"We ordered three different versions of the famous taco pizza  and it was AWESOME!!!! It was exactly like we remembered it! The service was also great, can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Had 2 pizzas delivered last night. One medium cheese and a large one topping. With a price tag of $36 (a few $ were for delivery) I had high hopes. Delivery was on time if not early, so that was a good start. Unfortunately the pizza did not live up to the price tag. I don't know how to describe it other than completely average. Have to feel bad for the Iowa natives if this is what you consider great pizza. I am guessing their lunch buffet would be a decent value. The search for good pizza in Gilbert, AZ continues!"}
{"text":"Love this place. A little taste of Iowa.   Must go for their Taco Pizza. It's good stuff, and you'll probably have leftovers. The staff are all nice, and I'd say the pizza is just ever-so-slightly better here than at their Tempe location.  Now it's time to open a Happy Joe's on the westside."}
{"text":"I have to say, I don't eat here often because I live about 45 minutes away, but last Friday night, I just had to have Happy Joe's.  About 3 month earlier, I had a disappointing experience.  Whoever was making the pizza, it wasn't done right. Something was off that evening.  So I decided to give it another try, and this time I am happy to report that it was done right! The ingredients were rich, the flavor plentiful. I ordered a large pizza 1/2 Taco, 1/2 Canadian Bacon Mushrooms and it was heavenly.  Now I'm not sure I would say that if I ate it on a regular basis, but somehow staying away and trying it every few months just hits the spot.  I would also say that At 27.00 dollars for a large pizza, it's kinda pricey, but I would pay it once in a while to get that amazing taste."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The food is bad and the service is worse. We went at 8 and they asked if it was for here or to go and we said here. When the food was ready, they had packed it up and said we couldn't stay because they were closing. It wasn't even 830 and they close at 9.  The pizza had bad flavor and the wings were soggy like frozen wings from a bag."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant all around! Staff is awesome and food is amazing as usual (as is in Dubuque!). I defiantly recommend checking this place out!! :) my husband and I went in in the afternoon and we're both very pleased to see the manager go around and speak with every person in the restaurant and really dedicate time to try and get to know his customers and make sure that they were all satisfied. We will be back!(:"}
{"text":"Whether you are from Iowa or not, this place is a great pizza place to visit!  I am from Phoenix and this was my first time eating this pizza, but it for sure won't be the last!  I loved the taco pizza and the BLT pizza, but I didn't taste a single bad slice in there!!  I would have given this place 6 stars if that was an option."}
{"text":"The pizza was very good but looking at the website it showed ice cream and such.. This place was so small people were standing around waiting for tables.  It really needs to be bigger.. That being said..the pizza was phenomenal but just a very tiny place maybe a dozen tables or so.There was no icecream like the internet add said... Would probably not go back again."}
{"text":"I've had better pizza at everywhere else I've ever had pizza. Frozen pizza from The grocery store that you bake at home is way better! This pizza crust reminded me of frozen pizza crust. Not very tasty and super expensive for one pizza and one order of wings. Sorry I wanted to like it since it's so close to home."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great pizza. We loved the original crust and sausage!  It's a nice change from all of the other pizza places!"}
{"text":"I used to eat Happy Joes in Iowa. Sooo happy to see one come to Gilbert! It was just as delicious as I remember! We ordered the Joe's special with original crust which was ham and sauerkraut. We would definitely order again! It tasted fresh and the crust has the perfect amount of crispiness."}
{"text":"3 mediums more then fed family of 5. 2'will do for that group size. Really good pizzas. Loved the taco pizza, meat lover pizza and classic pepperoni. I will surprise my friends by bribing them here for a taco pizza soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure if I visited this place on a bad day or their food is just this level of awful. I ordered wings and breadsticks to try this place out after what appeared to be mostly positive reviews, but I'm thinking they didn't get what I ordered. The wings barely had sauce, but plenty of grease. They were soggy and bland. The bread sticks were mediocre and the sauce tasted like a can of spaghetti o's with the noodles scooped out. Before you say everything say too long I live less than 1/2 a mile from this place... Do yourself a favor. Go visit Little Cesar's a block away. If you are eating garbage, at least you won't be charged a fortune for it."}
{"text":"AMAZING! My sisters and I ordered from here. The taco pizza was so fun and very very tasty! We also got wings and you can really tell that they are quality and hand made. What ever you do, don't skip the cinnamon pizza! It was so yummy! I almost wanted to just eat that! The owner delivered our pizza and was so sweet! I really cannot gush enough over this place. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"It was a must have when we went Iowa but now that it's only 45 minutes away we are very happy. 10 min away would be awesome!  Pizza is great, love the taco and BLT. A taste of home is now close. Gilbert is lucky to have them."}
{"text":"YUCK! What is the big deal... Got the taco pizza. Tasted like some dry meat and doritos on cardboard. Every review is people talking about their great memories of this pizza from childhood... So your memories are great?!? but the pizza is terrible. And when i called to order a carry out, I asked for the size in inches- BECAUSE THATS WHAT IS ON THE MENU ONLINE and the girl says \"well what sz is that?\" REALLY?!? You work there, you're literally standing at a computer, you dont know the sizes of the pizzas? And then she said, \" and you just want to pay when you pick it up?\" versus what?!? NEVER. AGAIN."}
{"text":"So flipping good!  Well done guys, well done!  Love that you added the buffet as well!  Delish!"}
{"text":"The environment was very friendly and welcoming! The offered me a free drink as I waited for my food."}
{"text":"This pizza joint has many different and interesting pizza options. Came here with 5 people and tried a few medium pizzas and had plenty left over for lunch the next day. We tried the pepperoni, meat lovers, and a taco pizza. The taco pizza was fun to try and I'd get it again. Tasted like a taco salad in pizza form. It wasn't very busy, we were actually the only people in there for a while. They do take out and there was a discount on online pizza orders for this month, so be sure to look for coupons."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner.............. Had a two topping medium pizza which was ok.. I've had freezer section pizza from the grocery store that was better!! I ordered boneless wings which were good my husband ordered bone in wings and  took one bite and spit it out!!!!! He said they were the slimiest wings he has EVER had!!!!  For what we paid tonight was so disappointing!!!! Very over priced!!!! We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Grew up on Happy Joes! Given Happy Joe lives in Phoenix it was awesome to have him open a few locations here. The wings are AWESOME! And the boneless wings are massive!"}
{"text":"The family (husbands side) has been eating Happy Joe's pizza since they were living back in Iowa/Illinois back in the 70s. I can tell you one thing, when Happy Joe's came to AZ, the family was seriously excited and kept raving about something called \"Taco Pizza\".  I had it one time and though, ok this is pretty good!    I decided to order Happy Joe's Pizza for pickup on New Years Eve to bring as our \"dish to pass\" to my sister in laws NYE party.  All original crust, I ordered 2 Little Joe's - 1 chorizo taco, 1 matador. 1 medium nacho joe. 1 large taco joe.  The family of course tore through the taco joe.  Which is good and the traditional taco pizza.  I really liked the others as well.  I think my favorite was the chorizo taco.   I've tried the taco pizza at the pub down the street from the house, and it really couldn't hold a candle to Happy Joe's.  I just wish the had a location closer to phoenix."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new. Won't be returning. Barely walked through the door and the girl behind the counter yelled out their greeting. Like, hold on a minute and let me get in the door. She rushed us while we were trying to decide what to get. Never been here before. Instead of trying to make recommendations, she was chatting with a fellow employee.   When my husband asked how long it would take she turned to the oven and told us there was nothing in it, so about 20 minutes. Okay. Paid and went across the parking lot to Zipp's to grab a drink. Came back to grab our order and for $38 it sure wasn't worth it. Got a medium ($18) of the Taco Joe's pizza, a small pepperoni, and a combo pasta. I could go on, but frankly, it's not worth it.... Just one more thing. Kids we're not a fan of the pasta (which feeds one by the way) or the pepperoni pizza. If you are in the mood for tasteless, overpriced food.... Be their guest. Don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"I got the taco supreme today, and let me tell you..... I'm in heaven!!!!!  I haven't had happy joes  pizza in over 30 years and it tastes just like I remember as a kid. Fantastic!!!!!!  Brought back so many good memories I almost cried. Way to go guys!!"}
{"text":"Since I can't give zero stars I will give one. First off, two of us went today and ordered boneless wings, pasta with side salad and a personal size pizza. About a half hour of waiting later, a pre-packaged (and what looked like a day old) salad arrives at the table. When I inquired about the rest of the order, she said oh yeah takes at least 30 minutes or so. The pizza also came and was along the standard of a frozen Tostino's pizza. Regular wings arrived instead of boneless, they were confused and after another ten minutes of waiting, we decided to leave since the rest of the order wasn't coming at the 40 minute mark and the stuff that did come, was not good. Asked for money back and won't return. Got money back minus a tip :-( Gilbert has too many great pizza and wing places; there is no way this one will survive."}
{"text":"Like the guy that wrote the bad review, I had to wait.  I expected it.  Opening day does not give an owner of a business any clue as to what to expect.  I thought they handled it as best as they could.  The owner gave all of us that were waiting free drinks.  Well worth the wait.  Taco pizza was as good as I remembered.  Kudos to the owner and people that work there."}
{"text":"We love having Happy Joes in the Valley of the Sun. Gluten free old fashioned garden (combo on Gilbert's menu.) was great. Just a few suggestions since newly opened...a bit more sauce on Combo pizza, toppings a bit more pineapple on Hawaiian, and more sauerkraut on Happy Joe's special as accustomed in Iowa. Have employees check once if anything is needed or how it is...I wish location was larger to include the ice cream parlor, but we understand larger locations in the metro area are in the works."}
{"text":"I really have to laugh at all the angry people leaving reviews on here. They're probably the sort that rant and rave about how \"amaze-balls\" Pizza Hut's trendy new crusts are, or who take shots of Papa John's florescent phosphorescent garlic sauce for breakfast. I see a lot of comparisons to Totino's frozen pizza too, and really, that should tell you all that you need to know. You obviously can't trust the culinary judgement of somebody who has willingly ingested a Totino's frozen pizza.  Like many on here, I grew up in Dubuque (And yes, I will party 'till I puke. Thanks for asking!), and I have many fond memories of birthday parties at that location, all the way up through high school first dates. It's a community fixture in a sleepy Iowa town, and for some people that is enough to sing the praises of the chain. For those of you that feel differently, you should try to calm down, be nice, and not be so quick to defecate on a business in the nascent stages of its existence.  When I go to the location in Dubuque, I'm genuinely looking forward to the pizza--and I don't even go for the taco, the old fashioned garden, or the Canadian bacon and sauerkraut. I just get plain old pepperoni. The nostalgia is on the side, but I can take it or leave it.  No, what keeps me coming back is the sauce. It is a great combination of the perfect amounts of sweet and spicy. I love the crust, which kind of has a slightly bubbly saltine cracker pattern on the bottom that is perfectly crunchy, yet with just the right amount of give near the top. I like how the toppings don't stop, they just kind of fade into the airy, pliable, and slightly chewy end crust. I don't know what blend of cheese they use, but it is unique and delicious, and doled out in perfect proportion to the amount of sauce and the other toppings. Put a Happy Joe's pepperoni pizza in front of me, and my mandible goes on auto pilot. I'll eat the whole thing, or possibly die trying.  So yes, some of us DO love this pizza for what it is. Do you really think if it was as awful as you claim, it would inspire such far-flung brand loyalty? Would we really crave it out here in the desert just because we fondly remember all the crazy detritus on the walls inside the Eastern Iowa location?   Perhaps the rest of you should take a lesson from the Hawkeyes on this board. Calm down. Be nice. Stop pretending to be Yelp's 895,334,234,234,432,434th digital incarnation of Gordon Ramsay. You probably won't be any worse off for abstaining from another anonymous tirade, and as an added benefit, you just might stop yourself from ruining it for the rest of us."}
{"text":"I have to send a BIG thank you to Happy Joe's for setting up shop in Arizona. Originally from Davenport, we moved to Vegas 5 years ago and have yet to find the same variety that Happy Joe's delivers. When we heard you opened we made a special trip down to see some friends and enjoy the food. We ended up taking 4 half baked pizza's back to Vegas to share with friends and family and it went over big!! Specially the Taco, they've never had anything like it! I hope Vegas is on your list!"}
{"text":"November special buy one pizza get one pizza for free.  I am from the Midwest so it is fun to get the taco pizza again and for a great price!"}
{"text":"Having Happy Joe's Pizza in Gilbert is a piece of nostalgia for me and my friends to grew up with them in Iowa and it makes me happy to be able to enjoy a Taco Joe pizza. I waited for them to work out the kinks before I tried this one and it was just as I remembered it (without the bell shaped coke glasses or the huge bowls of ice cream) I will return the next time I am feeling sentimental. For those of you who are comparing this to frozen pizza, I'm sorry you had such lofty expectations. For me and my friends, this is just what we needed in town."}
{"text":"Went opening night.  Called in a taco pizza...said it would be an hour.  Got there and they said it would be 2.5 hours longer. Get this...before they would check on the order they made me pay only to tell me that I would have to wait 2.5 more hours.  Needless to say I demanded my money back and walked out!  This place is a circus!!! Undeserving of anything near a 5 star rating! 0 stars!!!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a good pizza and drove past Happy Joe's. We told ourselves lets try it, its something new. We said, \"How badly can you mess up a pepperoni and mushroom pizza?\"  Well... We ordered just that and got a pepperoni and ground beef pizza. The pizza has a frozen after taste, and I had to eat it with ranch.  Double check your order before leaving with the pizza you ordered (especially since it's not cheap).  The BBQ wings were not that bad, although they could have been frozen too.   Will not return, would rather have Papa Johns for half the price."}
{"text":"So I want to give more stars. Last week had an amazing pizza delivered. Half taco half combo. Today had the same pizza delivered with some yummy chicken wings. Wings are good but the pizza was crisp on the bottom but raw. When I called  they offered to replace it but weren't overly customer focused and it felt a bit short like I was putting them out. So I have an inedible pizza now waiting on another. I just want good service and good pizza. Please come through and I hope my next review is better. I will let you know when the second (hopefully fully cooked) pie gets here. Just please work on the service."}
{"text":"I do not get why this place gets good reviews.  Pizza tasted like the pizza slice I remember having at the public pool as a kid....sauce was over-spiced with oregano.  Crust tasted like it was pre-made.  Just horrible.  I wish I could say the service made it better....it did not...the girls behind the register were bored and disinterested in answering any questions.  There are a dozen other decent/good pizza places in the area are worthy.  Save the effort trying the \"new/hot\" place."}
{"text":"Love, love, loved! My husband, son and I got to come eat here today. We are originally from Iowa and moved to Tucson 5 years ago. Happy Joe's happens to be one of the restaurants we miss terribly!  We had heard that Happy Joe's had opened in Gilbert and we were up in Phoenix.  We walked in and first off I ran into three gals I went to High School in Muscatine, Iowa from over 10 years ago! Seriously, what are the odds?  The customer service was incredible and immediately we ordered a taco pizza and blt pizza. Personally, taco is my fave and blt is my hubby's. I was so delighted our pizza came and it was on point! The blt was delicious and my husband was so pleased.  We also got the chance to meet the owners they are wonderful! I am so happy for them and want to say thank you for bringing Happy Joe's to the Southwest! We have missed it. For those of you who aren't familiar with taco pizza it is amazing and if you want something traditional I promise the pepperoni will not disappoint! They layer the pepperoni until the whose pizza is covered their sausage is delish too!  I am a huge fan and so excited this is here!"}
{"text":"We're from the Midwest and just love that we now have a happy joes in Gilbert!  Go for the lunch buffet so you can try everything to find your favorite. A few of our  faves.... 1. Taco.....try this 1st if you're a 1st timer 2. Nacho Joe......it's a taco pizza with nacho cheese instead of pizza sauce...what? ?!!!! Delicious.  3. BLT....mayo on s pizza...sounds gross right? Its freakin' genius and super yummy.  4. Pepperoni.....it's like little nuggets of pepperoni instead of slices.  Maybe it brings me back to my childhood,  but I still think it's one special pie.  5. Cinnamon dessert pizza.....I've compared every dessert pizza to this one my whole life.  It's a must have if you like a sweet ending to your meal. 6. Breakfast pizza"}
{"text":"Step dad likes the pizza. I thought it was \"okay\". I had wings. May have tasted better well done? Seemed a little rubbery for my taste."}
{"text":"As amazing as I remember as a kid! Good to see them make it to Arizona! Even though they are still finding their way, this beats nearly all of the other pizza options in the area."}
{"text":"It's like being at home, my favorite pizza ever!  They have a great breakfast buffet on Sundays so you can try a little of everything.   The Canadian Bacon and taco pizzas are an absolute must.   You won't find pizza like this anywhere else.   We need one in North Phoenix too!"}
{"text":"Their crust is probably best suited for taco pizza. I thought dinner was to pricey for two people. Their medium chicken pizza was very filing for the two of us. Might go back for their lunch smorgasbord. Service was very slow and we were the only two people in there on a Monday evening."}
{"text":"The service was fine as was the restaurant. But the food we ordered was tasteless. We decided since they were famous for the taco pizza we'd order that. The only flavor was from the chips on top. Others there were raving about it. One family said they drove from surprise just to eat here. The only thing I can figure it's an Iowa thing..."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about trying the original taco pizza but glad I did because it was delicious.  We will ne back for sure."}
