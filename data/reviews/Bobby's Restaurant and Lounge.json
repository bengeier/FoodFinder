{"text":"Took the girl for our 3 year anniversary, and more after! Love it, great food and people. Excellent pricing."}
{"text":"If you like precooked food and tacky decorations you have found the right place. From the frozen garlic bread to the terrible cheesecake, Bobby's must have a phobia of fresh food. Save your money and avoid this over priced disaster!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Bobby's for the first time last night.  We came in for drinks first.  We really liked the atmosphere from the minute we walked in, especially when we went upstairs- it really had the feel of a jazz lounge.  Shortly after we arrived the music started, which we really enjoyed throughout our time there.  The bartender was very friendly and filled our drinks exactly when we needed.  We had the stuffed mushroom appetizer, which was very good, although the mushrooms were small, not like other stuffed mushrooms I've had before.  We decided to eat upstairs (rather than downstairs) so that we could enjoy the music through dinner.  We were impressed with the wide selection available on the menu.  However, in retrospect, I think they would do better with a somewhat smaller menu selection so that they don't have the problem of being out of items and also so that they can focus on signature dishes.  My husband was trying to decide between the halibut and the mahi mahi; I had decided I wanted the halibut.  There were 4 different types of ways to order the fish and they all sounded great on the menu.  But then our waitress informed us that they were out of both mahi AND halibut.  There were 4 types of fish to choose from and they were out of 2 of them. We weren't very happy about this as we had looked at the menu in advance and had already decided that we wanted the fish.  So I chose the sea bass instead, picata style.  My husband chose the sea scallops.  We also each ordered a spinach salad.  The salads were delicious and huge.  But we were very disappointed in the sea bass and the scallops.  Both seemed to be very low quality.  The sea bass did not even taste like other sea bass I've had before.  The picata sauce was OK, and it covered up the taste of the fish, so that made it edible.  The gnocchi potatoes that came with the sea bass were very good.  The broccolini was blah.  The sea scallops were tiny.  I have never seen such small scallops at a restaurant like this (in this price range).  The gorgonzola mashed potatoes were very dry (my husband suspected that they were instant potatoes).  His asparagus was super skinny and small, although he said it tasted good.  The scallops were like rubber, especially since they were so small.  The prosciutto that was wrapped around the scallops was dried up.  As we discussed it, we kept saying \"it's too bad\" because the service was good, the atmosphere was good, it's great to have a restaurant where you have live entertainment while you eat, and the location is great, but the food isn't up to par, especially at these prices.  I can't believe the sea bass was $37 - the quality was WELL below that (same for the scallops at $28).  If Bobby's would increase the quality of the food (especially the entrees) to match or exceed the prices and probably hire a different chef, I think this could be a very successful restaurant.   If they dont' make these changes, they will probably end up closing.  We don't plan to go to Bobby's again, as there are many other restaurants to choose from in the same price range and in the same area, but with excellent food."}
{"text":"Tried calling to make a reservation and was hung up on. If they cannot handle their business properly I'd suggest a new line of work. Based on what I've heard if you do go, be prepared for average service entwined with expensive prices. I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is embarrassing! The service was terrible, the management was rude and unorganized. The food was not good and way over priced. The setting is so fake classy... I have no idea how it has managed to keep up in Kierland Commons! Take your time and money elsewhere."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Lets start with the decor, I felt like i was in Old Hollywood. Windows from floor to ceiling, blown glass lighting and fixtures everywhere. There is a fantastic art wall, and classy white leather booths. Thats just the downstairs. Their lounge is located on the second floor. Happy hour is a must! Prices are unbeliveably reasonable. Beautiful bar and live music.  On to the food, the menu is extensive even a picky eater could find something satisfying.We started the evening with the bruschetti and the calamari  both excellent choices.My date had the wedge salad and their specialty dinner for the evening which was delicious and perfectly prepared. I ordered the Pistachio crusted lambchops and they were scrumptious in a creamy dijon sauce YUMMY. We then shared a tiramisu and espressos. Overall a very romantic and enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate a birthday. The service was very good, as was the live music. My biggest complaint revolves around the food itself, and the cost of such food. The place is pretty expensive, but the execution of the food was mediocre. The vegetable paella lacked any type of seasoning, as did a number of other dishes. Two of our guests did enjoy the seafood pasta dish though.  As for the dessert, I was highly disappointed when I saw sprinkles on the sides of the cannoli (as oppose to the traditional chocolate bits). I don't know why they thought that could be swapped out. Definitely not up to my expectations.  Overall it worked out for a couple of people in our party, but half of us were disappointed with something or other offered."}
{"text":"Bobby's is in the upscale Kierland Mall.  We had been to  other restaurants in the mall and the concierge at the Westin resort suggested we try Bobby's. So we went there on a Tuesday night, It was empty except for the lounge upstairs where there was a lot of noise and several people. The food was mediocre - my veal shank was tough and chewy and came with lumpy mashed potatoes and overcooked asparagus. The dessert was also unexciting. Service was indifferent and the waitpersons had to be summoned for water. If you are in the mall there are other restaurants which have better food and service. Zinc Bistro comes to mind"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I had what we would call the worst tasting food ever.  I'm sorry I did not go with my gut feeling after reading reviews and go somewhere else.  I give two stars, one for service, second for live music, both those were good."}
{"text":"Overpriced food. The atmosphere was great and the food was pricey so I had high expectations. Everything we ordered (bruschetta, chicken parmigiana, coconut shrimp) tasted bland and mundane. Like something I could buy in the freezer section. Buy the end of the meal I felt like I had just wasted $60."}
{"text":"I really REALLY wanted to like this place, as I had heard good things, and I love JAZZ.   The atmosphere was ok, the food was ok, and the service was ok. I can't really say anything would stand out as memorable, other than the fantastic company I had that evening (an old, dear friend.)  I'm the type of person that if nothing stands out, then why go back? Maybe I'll have to check it out again later... but only if nothing else sounds good."}
{"text":"Music terrible food way over priced 39 dollar rib eye should not be paper thin , the venue was off the hook should have been a great experience but you can't judge a book by it cover!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  DO NOT GO HERE WITH A LARGE GROUP. I wish yelp gave me the option for zero or negative stars. My friends planned an event for me at this place and it was the worst experience I have ever had with a business.   When my friend was trying to iron out detail about the event, Bobby always insisted on phone calls and would not communicate hardly anything via email. They agreed on no food/drink minimum, happy hour prices, a set two hour window, said we could bring in decor and a cake with no fees, and the have the entire upstairs space for the event.  When we arrived, Bobby was not present but his sister, the night manager was. She was extremely rude from the start, would only let us have a few tables instead of the entire lounge and said she had no idea about the agreement or conversation my friends had with Bobby.  We were flexible, thinking they might really need the space. But next thing we know she is saying there is a food/drink minimum, threatening my friends who planned the event, and saying we had to pay a cake cutting fee which we were told was not required.  Not only was she insanely rude but when I became aware of the situation and asked to speak with her, she threatened to call the police and walked away. Talk about bad management and zero conflict resolution skills!  I couldn't believe this!  I left a note for the owner, Bobby, asking him to call me to discuss the situation. I waited a few weeks before posting this to give him a chance to make it right. He has not.  So, please don't ever go there with a large party. After reading other posts, I think they do this intentionally to bully more money out of people.  They refuse to email so you have no documentation of what was discussed, then they play good cop/bad cop as Bobby is amazingly never there on nights or weekends."}
{"text":"Entirely unimpressed. Service was adequate, not deserving of the 18% auto gratuity. The staff were barely present in the dining room. Unfortunately we had to search for reservations last minute in the area and we didn't want to wait to eat until 9pm with 2 kids. Portion sizes were minuscule for the prices they charge. The shrimp & scallop scampi was coated in garlic. The surf & turf was more like an appetizer with a $52 price tag. The desserts were microscopic for $8. I would be embarrassed to charge people these prices. Flavors are better at Maggiano's, dare I even say Olive Garden. I couldn't leave in good conscience without letting them know we were dissatisfied. The \"manager\" was flippant and wholly unapologetic for the disappointing experience. No wonder they have 3 stars, they should have less. The \"entertainment\" was equivalent to a wedding nightmare. Don't bother with this place, you can get better quality & tastier food at any corporate restaurant."}
{"text":"We decided to go here for the $32 summer special.  We went early to have a glass of wine and an appetizer before dinner.  It was very comfortable and enjoyable sitting and listening to the live music.  The food and service was amazing both upstairs and downstairs.  We would highly recommend the entire experience.  What a great find!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance in this place is incredible.  Absolutely gorgeous.  The service is top-notch.  Where it loses points is in the food.  The garlic cheese bread to start is great, but it goes a bit downhill from there.  I got the butternut squash raviolis which were great on their own, but the sauce on top just seemed to be missing something.  Still good, but I had hoped for butter.  I also got the lobster ravioli and and crab cake appetizer.  Neither tasted fabulous.  The crab cake seemed to be of the frozen variety and simply thrown in the deep fryer when ordered.  The lobster raviolis didn't have much ravioli in them.  Something crunchy was in there that I couldn't put my finger on.  My husband ordered the cannelloni.  Again, it wasn't bad, but for the price, just didn't hit the spot.   Overall, I think I would come here again for cocktails in the lounge (the ambience is that great!) but I would pass on dinner."}
{"text":"I've been going to Bobby's for Lunch and Dinner for a few years now and NOT even once have I been disappointed. Great Food, Great Service & a Fabulous atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have mix feelings on this place, that's it, 3.5 stars...  Two of us stopped at Bobby's after a movie, being my 1st time here, didn't really know what to expect, and I was in flip-flops...So here's a bit of recap:  -Bread basket - warm baked garlic/cheese bread, definitely one of a kind...  -Blue Point Oysters on half shelf - fresh and mid-siazed oysters, pair with fresh lemon juice, some horseradish and some tabasco sauce, this just made my day!! Surprisingly, the usual customers of Bobby's don't seem to have oysters with tabasco cuz when I asked for it, our waitress had to reconfirm, and it didn't come in the original bottle, instead was pulled into a little sauce/juice cup...just kinda of weird... But I don't mind as long as the oysters are good!  -Cannelloni with Mariana sauce - tasty and filling, but feel like the Mariana sauce was kind of short, maybe they could pour a bit more sauce? It's a bit dry eating without the sauce...but overall it's good. -Lobster linguini - many different kinds of seafood (lobster tail, shrimp, scallops, clams and mussels) in a Mariana sauce. It didn't give me a surprising feeling, I think it was just average, and the noodles were a bit dry and hard...  -No dessert. What a surprise? Well, they 'presented' the whole menu on a tray. Seriously? I've seen raw food being presented on a tray to show the freshness, not dessert. I guess when I order dessert, I always wait for the excitement to come, to surprise me, I mean it's dessert, you can do so many imaginations with it, I have never seen restaurants have created a same exact look of dessert before (unless it's the standard form)... so I'm expecting something does not only feed my taste bug but also eye-catching...after I saw the whole presentation, I didn't want any, that just blew off my hopes..  Overall experience at Bobby's was just fine. It was a very slow Sunday night, but I do appreciate very much the live music...And I just saw they have a $30 special dinner menu? Since when? Today? Cuz I wasn't told at the restaurant yesterday (3/20)..."}
{"text":"I had a great meal with co-workers here. My favorite was the meatball app. I also got a caprese salad and fries. All were good. The jazz music was very nice as well. A good spot with friendly staff for sure. The happy hour deals are also a great deal."}
{"text":"First time to Bobby's and first of all the service was really excellent.  A couple of disappointments.  We were told they had jazz and we looking forward to this. It was a a Sunday night but we had called twice to confirm they were playing jazz.  With a restaurant that has Jazz in the name this was to be expected. What was delivered was a synthesizer with lounge music.  The other disappointment was the blackened fish. They just put Cajun spice on it and called it blackened. When I asked if they could blacken it they took to kitchen and just added more spice.  After we explained our disappointment they took the fish off our bill and gave us a free dessert for the lack of Jazz music. Steaks were average.  Lots of other restaurants to choose from"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money!!!  The service was horrible, the manager was very rude and at the end of the night, they double charged my credit card. We had a 7PM reservation and did not leave the restaurant until 10:30PM due to our server only walking by the table every 30-45 minutes. He would ask how things were and then turn his back and leave before anyone could answer. My steak was horrible under seasoned and tasted like a sponge, so I asked for a manager. When the manager came over, I asked her to take my steak back and that I would share my mother's entrée instead. She asked me three additional times if there was ANYTHING she could bring me off the menu to replace it, and I said no each time. Finally she asked me a 4th time, \"Please, I will bring you ANYTHING off the menu to replace your steak\" and I agreed to order the Sea bass without capers. Well, it came WITH capers, which I scraped off as my entire family was already done eating and I was the only one with a plate in front of them. The manager made our server apologize in which he said \"I'm sorry I did not exceed your expectations. That is my apology.\" and turned his back toward us and quickly walked away as we were trying to say something to him. We visited Bobby's for an early Mother's Day dinner, and it turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had. To add to it, one of the employees took my mother's candle (that was given to her as a gift) to the back kitchen and we had to ask all the servers if they had seen it. One of them replied, \"I know who has that\" and went to retrieve it. In addition, we were charged an 18% gratuity which was NEVER put in writing on the $50 gift certificate we used toward our $335 bill. The manager said that is what they do even if it is not explained on the certificate. She said since she \"took over\" for the server, that it was HER 18% tip. In addition, my Sea Bass (that I felt was \"forced\" to order), was put on the bill. When we asked the manager about the charge, she said \"Well, I didn't say I would get you anything on the menu for FREE, did I?\" I cannot believe the way we were treated at that restaurant and will never go back. To make matters worse, they double charged my credit card, which I now will need to dispute. This was the WORST dining experience ever."}
{"text":"I actually wanted to give this place fewer than four stars, but I really can't because the food was good.   We went here last Sunday, because they had an ad for a summer special.  It was $30 for a glass of wine, salad, entree, and dessert.  Great deal.  The food was actually really good as well.  The wine was nice, the cesar salad was great and my shrimp scampi was excellent (although I still smelled like garlic the next day).  The tiramisu was just okay.  It was pretty dead, but the live music started as well were leaving (didn't see it, just heard it)...the funny thing was when we got there, they gave us our menu.  When we asked about the summer special they brought out the other menu.  (you have to ask for it), but it's worth it, my entree alone would have been over $20.  I like Kierland, and would love to eat here more often, but this place did not \"wow\" me....it was just good."}
{"text":"I went here for a work Christmas Party. I was in heaven. The food was delicious as was the atmosphere. Basically we had the 4 course dinner special. I was drinking chardonnay as I like the white wines. It was cold and delicious. It was a little different for us because I had the eggplant rollentin AND caesar salad with real anchovies. I like the salty fish, blame it on genetics. I appreciate that the fish wasn't just in the salad dressing. Next up was filet mignon. I have never had better filet mignon. It was tall as it was big around. It was not small, and oh so tender and juicy. I finished up with New York cheesecake. I am sure they had to roll me out the door I was so stuffed but every bite was orgasmic. Every time my glass came anywhere near empty it was refilled. The staff was on target and kept us well fed and wined. We finished the night with some tasty port wine. Dessert and then dessert. Fabulous."}
{"text":"Grilled Salmon, angel hair pasta bolognese entree fantastic. We adored the bruschetta appetizer.  Live music in the upstairs lounge but you can hear it from any seat. We really  loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very poor service! When you walk in the place is great which all goes downhill when the waiter takes 15 minutes to say hello. Then the food takes awhile. Not very happy. We tried to say something to I guess the person we think was the manager but didn't get us anywhere. Waiter told us \"better luck next time\". How hilarious. Food is mediocre. Maggianos is even better then this. This is in no way the borgata style mancuso place at all! Different owners also we found out. Save yourself now!"}
{"text":"Saying its Italian is a bit of a stretch. Shockingly empty. Great decor. Service was very good. Great selection of food. More a combo of steaks & seafood & specialties than Italian. Terrific garlic bread. Gorgonzola mashed potatoes were tasteless. Calamari was crispy & fresh but the sauce was too mild plain tomato sauce. Veal dish was excellent. Seafood special was good. Dessert offerings could have been more varied & we're all very heavy. We will go again but will change up food choices."}
{"text":"Fell into Bobby's strolling through Kierland on a warm winter evening.  My husband saw Osso Buco on the menu and we had to go in (he ended up ordering something different).  The decor was cool.  We were seated up stairs and a band (typical Frank Sinatra mood music) started playing shortly after.  Fitting for the restaurant.  For the food:   * Veal Meatballs & Risotto - Served with red sauce on the meatballs.  Seriously couldn't get any better.  Reminded me of my husband's Italian grandmother's meatballs & I couldn't stop eating until I was completely full because we haven't had them in so long. The risotto was so creamy & awesome too. Delicious!! A++  * Organic Spinach Salad - Good.  Not the best evah but it was good.  * Gnocchi & Veal Meatballs - Served with a white sauce.  OMG!! Loved them. A++  * Wedge Salad - Husband says \"It was really good.\"  Me \"It looked like your typical wedge salad.\"  Drink:  * Pink Lemonade - Order it.  You won't be disappointed.  I did ask to change the vodka & they were very accommodating.  We left very full & can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful place but terrible service. Terrible food!!!! Atmosphere was middle age white couples. We were a group of people from different ethnicities and were pretty much out of place. Not good for big groups. They are not accommodating at all! For such a pricey place you would think the food would be good. It was so bad and does not even taste fresh!   Very disappointed, would not come back!"}
{"text":"Mahi Mahi was pretty good, a bit over cooked for my liking.  SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE.  It was bad.  We told him we needed a few minutes to look over menu and he didn't come back at all, a new server came back 20 minutes later.  Throughout dinner he would look at our table and just walk by, never asking how our experience was.  Very odd..."}
{"text":"After  reading numerous good reviews on this restaurant  I stopped in for happy hour with a friend. We both ordered the house wine from the menu  it was old and stale even the  ice tea was old and soured. We ordered food with our drinks Fried Cheese and  Veal Meatballs. We had hopes the food would redeem the place but it was pretty lousy. We left without finishing our drinks or food."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to have her birthday dinner somewhere special, and unfortunately we were very disappointed with Bobby's.  Herein lies a list of grievances:  * Unorganized hostess and manager. We only knew the birthday girl, so we didn't know what the other guests would look like. We thought it wouldn't be an issue, but even with us providing the manager with the name on the reservation, she couldn't tell us where we were seated or if anyone from our party had arrived.  * Misrepresentation. The birthday girl called to make sure there would be live jazz, but the whole night featured a bad Latin fusion group instead.  * Crowded. There were too many tables and chairs crammed into the main downstairs room. Guests could not freely leave the table on one side without bumping into other patrons.  * Awkward. The chairs are too short for the table height; both men and women at our table had to uncomfortably perch at the edge of their seats to reach their food. The menus are also too large in dimension (or again there are too many seats crammed together) as we couldn't even hold our menus open without smacking each other.  * Rude. Our waitress was short with us and pushy about getting our orders. Also, she seemed angry when we asked if we could get a photo of our group celebrating a birthday. While we posed for our group photo, a couple waiters didn't just clear our plates -- they actually had the gall to clear all of our coats, jackets and phones by throwing them into a pile at one end of the table. That was really weird! Why are the waiters touching our purses and cell phones?  The one good thing: * The pistachio crusted lamb chop was delicious; it's the only reason this rating has one star."}
{"text":"Great place. I was looking for a place to take my wife for some great food, and good music, and Bobby's delivered. We ate downstairs, then finished up with some drinks in the jazz lounge upstairs, and it was the perfect night. I would go back anytime!!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for New Years we had a blast!! We sat upstairs with the band they played really good music!! The food was amazing! The ambience was amazing and we had a great time! Tons of desserts I highly recommend the apple cake so good!! The crab stuffed mushrooms are Devine!! Make a reservation they have long waits!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! The first time I visited my husband and I ate downstairs then went upstairs to lounge for a glass of wine and to listen to the live music. Our bartender was great and was our server.  Second time around we stopped in to have a glass of wine in the lounge. They had live music (even on a Tuesday!) It was a charming piano man singing the jazzy crooner tunes. They even sang happy birthday to me and brought me a delicious piece of tiramasu. Keep in mind we just had a few glasses of wine, no dinner! Our bartender was absolutely fantastic. Upon realizing we didn't have cash and wanted to tip the piano player, the bartender let us have cash from his drawer and we just added that amount to his tip.    I will absolutely be back! This is our favorite date night spot!!!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place right around the corner! Amazing food and service! The bar upstairs is awesome with live music. Recommended for dates or anniversaries :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. They make their own bread and it is amazing. The meatball sandwich was terrific. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The restaurant is beautiful. Nice outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"I dined here as part of a large party. While the filet mignon was well prepared it lacked seasoning. The gorgonzola sauce wasn't enough to give the steak flavor."}
{"text":"Bad- really bad - as in puking before you leave and the rest of the night... Not exactly a fun evening out.... We wanted to like it- the entrees sounded good- they looked good but one bite of bad seafood and the good ambience and music can't make up for a restaurant that serves inedible cuisine.  It was a miserable dinner and we are still sick wishing we'd never tried Bobby's and at least while lying here trying to recover we can warn others from a similar fate- literally left half a bottle of wine still on the table because the effects of the bad seafood were already hitting :( too many other great options in North Scottsdale- sick and a waste of money :("}
{"text":"The Vibe: Contemporary, colorful with a bit of traditional crispness thrown in for good measure.  The Service: The hostess was cool although we had reservations. She suggested we wait while our booth was being prepared... but never told or showed us where to sit. I got the impression she was irritated. Oh well...  Our server seemed very green and didn't seem to know much about the food and even less about the wine. That's always a bummer. But she was extremely warm and friendly. Too bad we didn't really see much of her and other people (including the [gasp!] owner) had to bring us drinks, clear our table (we sat with empty plates in front of us for almost 10 minutes) and bring the dessert tray.  The Food: As a (sometimes) vegetarian, it can be a challenge to scour the town for delicious and meat-free dishes. Bobby's had \"Vegetarian Paella\" which caught my eye. Thankfully, our server knew enough about the menu to tell me that it contains chicken broth. Why anyone would advertise something as \"vegetarian\" and then use chicken broth to make it is beyond me. I went with the pasta purses instead. I wasn't disappointed. The basil sauce was divine and the tender, cheese-filled purses were incredible. A large, well-seasoned portobello mushroom cap was the center of the plate and the meal. It was so good I could have made a meal out of a few of those in the basil sauce, no pasta necessary.  My friend chose the nine-ounce filet with Roberto sauce (sauteed mushrooms and onions). He had to send it back as it was not cooked to order, but it was perfect on the second try. He said it was wonderful. He also ordered the broccolini and the gorgonzola mashed potatoes (also vegetarian, fyi). The broccolini was well-cooked, but cold by the time it reached. The potatoes were flavorful with a rustic, rough mash. For dessert, I had tiramisu and my friend chose the carrot cake. My tiramisu has a good flavor, but I could tell it had been made at least 3-4 days before, as it tasted of a refrigerator. The carrot cake was moist and delicious.  All in all, great experience. And the owner was warm and wonderful. I'll definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"Average.... the food was ok. The price was high for quality. Don't think we would go back.   Service was good. Drinks were good. Music on the patio was not so good, you could hear the mall music and the live band."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday this year and I was blown away. The Italian style food that we ate was wonderful (the bruschetta was to die for!). We hadn't made reservations but were able to be seated two tables down from the band on a Saturday night. It was wonderful to hear the crooning of jazz singer doing a repertoire of jazz standards. I definitely recommend this restaurant for a date night or a small celebration (it's a little bit too noisy for any groups larger than 4 or 6 if you want to actually hear the conversation)."}
{"text":"For starters-I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK THERE! THEY ARE ONLY TRYING TO MAKE MONEY AND NOT SERVE CUSTOMERS! DEFINITELY DO NOT GO THERE FOR ANY LARGE GROUP PARTY ABOVE 8!  Short version: Overpriced, rude service, potentially racist, website oversells the place, deceiving advertisements, unprofessional management, food had to be sent back by two different people in my group due to poor food prep. Spiral pesto pasta was good. Restaurant is nice inside.  Long version: I held my husbands birthday party there and I regret it. The information given to me via phone when I called to make the reservation was COMPLETELY different from the information given to me once my party arrived. First, we were told there was a dance floor-there isn't! There's a wooden floor with tables on it-absolutely no open space for ANY kind of dancing. Next, we were told there was \"live music and dancing\". Well, the \"live\" music was a guy playing basically a Casio-type keyboard and singing music that no one can dance to over a microphone. Over the phone, I was told they preferred a large party to spend $30 per person MINIMUM but it was NOT mandatory. When I got there, our waiter told us my party had to spend AT LEAST $30 per person and if they didn't, my credit card would be charged the difference of the minimum and what we actually spent. The waiter was male, tall, Caucasian with brown hair, he was rude, unprofessional condescending, and an instigator. When I explained the miscommunication to his manager, His general manager wasn't much better. Fran spoke to me like I wasn't worth her time. She was dismissive, abrasive, and cold. she stated for large groups, they require everyone to purchase a meal, everyone to spend a minimum amount of money per person, they charge a cake cutting fee if you want to bring a cake, and they make you sign a \"contract\" giving them the okay to charge your credit card in case the minimum isn't achieved. When I explained none of this was stated over the phone, she argued with me back and forth for quite some time. She stated there wasn't anything that could be done, she stated she is trying to make money to keep her doors open and that I should understand, she stated \"this is a business, what do you expect?\" After arguing with her for quite a while, she eventually chalked it up to a training issue with her staff and let us continue our party. As soon as we were done eating, we began to talk and laugh amongst our selves. after all, it was a party. meanwhile, we noticed the wait staff just staring at us. so much so, we all felt uncomfortable and left."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, tasty tasty delish food!! I loved this place. My husband & I went here for our anniversary dinner, this place is so well done inside- the decor, lights, jazz bar upstairs and great selection of drinks and music.   We took a booth at the lower floor later on with the 4 course meal dinner and I have to say, each and every dish we had was simply delicious and fresh! The salads, Eggplant Rollettini, Bruschetta, Chicken marsala and the salmon!  The best part were desserts- we loved the cheesecake and really delectable Tiramisu- like a die for taste, if you are a tiramisu lover anyway.  Must try, they have a good selection on menu for vegetarians as well, just in case."}
{"text":"Decor is pleasant. Food was only a three-star rating.   Bland for the type of dishes on the menu. Portions are reasonable for the price. Waiter never smiled once. We had to ask for our water glass to be filled each time. My husband asked for another piece (not a basket a piece) of bread and you would have thought we asked for a new car. We would not return."}
{"text":"For dinner, Bobby's is expensive and not the most fun atmosphere for a gal in her 20s. But! I have now been here a couple of times for larger parties that took place upstairs and Bobby's was great! Tasty food and nice environment with a live musician."}
{"text":"Love this place, I've been twice now. It's a bit spendy but a very classy place. Delicious food."}
{"text":"Good food Extremely slow service. I will think twice about returning as there are so many options available."}
{"text":"worst restaurant ever!!!!  hostesses were rude.  service was terrible-they threw the bread on the table-literally threw it.  food was disgusting and way over priced (both ordered seafood).  i would never come back nor recommend this place to anyone.  go somewhere else!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group for a friend's birthday party and it was a pleasant experience. Half of our party was late to the reservation on top of us pushing it close to the kitchen's closing time time but they were very accommodating. There were minor hiccups but they were made up for. Over all I would say I had a positive experience!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money. Baked oysters were decent but the fish and chicken were below average"}
{"text":"The overall atmosphere is modern and contemporary and offers a more traditional dining area downstairs with a jazz lounge upstairs where the bar is located.  The place is generally loud on whichever floor you choose so we've opted for the upstairs jazz lounge as we prefer the sound of music over the usual loud restaurant roar.  Overall, the food is really quite good.  The escargot is served on mushrooms and could use a bit more garlic, but isn't bad.  The Caesar salad came with just the right amount of Caesar dressing that was fairly light and not overly creamy.  The vegetarian paella is an excellent dish and probably my favorite item on the menu.  The various vegetables are all cooked to just the right level of crispness/tenderness as appropriate and the serving is so huge that I always end up taking half of the dish home.  The capellini and pomodoro, which can often be a somewhat boring dish, was flavorful with fresh tomatoes, garlic, and basil.  The Chilean sea bass was good, although I'm used to a thicker cut of fish than what was served and my husband found the gorgonzola mashed potatoes to be suitable as far as flavor but a bit off-putting in that they left a strange filmy texture on his teeth, perhaps from the gorgonzola.  They also provide a basket of fresh garlic bread that has just the right amount of cheese on top of it.    The wine list has some decent selections, but isn't the best I've ever seen, however, we've managed to find a palatable selection on each of our visits.  The entertainment is generally reasonably decent too, nothing that I would pay a cover charge for, but for entertainment during dinner, it's really not bad.  Overall, this is a place that we'll be back to as we've had consistently good experiences here."}
{"text":"Sad to see that this location closed. They had an awesome happy hour and great atmosphere. We were looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"We ate in the lounge - drinks were great, music seemed pretty solid to me.  Cover band really put the vibe at a much lower key given the price and atmosphere - a lot more comfortable than you might expect given the decor.  Also lack of people there - the whole restaurant, not just the lounge, was not busy at all at 7:30-10:30ish on a Saturday night.    Food - deserving of four stars.  The specials were by all accounts amazing, no one had anything left over.  Skip dessert was the consensus among my group."}
{"text":"We have always had a good experience at this restaurant. Menu is interesting and our food has always been fresh and properly prepared. My only bitch is the beer list has not changed in several years and it is time for a update."}
{"text":"We were lied to tonight!! We went to Bobby's for dinner on 2-16 at 5:30 (1000 points) using Opentable for the reservation but got an email later, after we finished eating there that the reservation was cancelled. We talked to a person who says they were the manager and she said they didn't have a reservation for us when clearly they did. I have the receipt for the meal, and the email stating the reservation was cancelled. The manager didn't even want to talk to us. I guess they won't mind if I dispute the charge since I wasn't there!."}
{"text":"We walked in and asked for a table for 3/booth.  The hostess said we can't give you a booth without a reservation.  They had 3 booths available!  They obviously didn't want our money, so we walked out! I'll be letting my Mayo doctor friends know not to come here (many live in the area) as it's hard to walk in without a reservation and get a good seat."}
{"text":"Very nice place... good food and ambience. Bit pricey..."}
{"text":"Where to start...I really really wanted to like this place.  It was our first time here and we like to try a new place on Date Night, so we went here, after hearing some pretty great things.    The host was nasty right away, which should have been the first sign.  We were seating downstairs for dinner, during happy hour when everyone was upstairs.  This was kind of nice, hearing the music and noise but having the restaurant to ourselves.    Our waitor was really great, very friendly and super helpful.  We ordered an app and I got the seafood platter off menu and the bf got a steak.    Instantly, we realized the food just wasn't prepared great or wasn't top quality.  The steak came out a bit cold, which was shocking.  We couldn't do dessert, I just can't have someone destroy that for me.  All in all we spent about $120 with tip and just wish we had not even bothered. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Food was extremely disappointing! The \"prime cut\" steak although not overcooked was the toughest steak I have ever tried. Service was not the best either,"}
{"text":"Very classy place.  I had a pasta dish, it was nicely prepared and just what I was looking for.  Nice lighting, attentive staff.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"Cold food hot plate.......obviously set in the window too long. Chicken was rubbery, most likely injected/marinated, high end restaurant why would they not buy free range or a more natural product. Green beans tough not sure how they accomplished this. Service slow and half the staff not overly friendly. Too many great places to eat, pass on this one"}
{"text":"This is a really terrific restaurant the food was fantastic and their happy hr menu has a ridiclious selection of great food. Oyster's on the 1/2 shell, butternut squash raviolo, crab stuffed mushrooms. The decor an atmosphere is very fun. We will be going back to try the regular menu as there are some very inviting dishes to try.  Yes the staff is not the best but the food was good."}
{"text":"I was expecting a jazz lounge but what I found was a jazz themed restaurant located in a Disneyland-esque shopping mall.   I was looking forward to taking my wife to a place with live jazz for Valentine's Day. Bobby's is not set up to enjoy jazz unless you are up stairs near the band. One could hear them but not enjoy them. The restaurant did not seem to be acoustically set up to spread the music throughout the restaurant. Because \"Jazz Lounge\" is included in the name I was expecting jazz to be featured rather than seeming like an afterthought.  Most of the food was good. The veggies were spot on; not too soft, not too raw. My duckling was delicious and falling off the bone. My wif'e's pork tenderloin was dry and lifeless. She however enjoyed her Creme Brulee, which if I remember correctly the waiter said was not made there, and I enjoyed my brownie which was made there.  The waiter was definitely capable...of taking our order and bringing our food. I had no sense that he cared one way or another if we enjoyed our experience. The not-ready-for-prime-time servers kept our water glasses full and the dirty not used plates away.   This restaurant is a piece of recreation art work. Technically it's fine but there is no joy or love to be felt in the finsihed product."}
{"text":"For $150 I would expect the food to be great.  Took over 90 minutes for cold food to come.  The large grilled chicken salad was the size of a small Salad.  They ran out of all deserts except some dry crusty brownies.  The calamari that was $12 was about 10 pieces total. Chicken piccata was 1 piece of chicken and congealed sauce.  It was awful"}
{"text":"Excellent food , great service !!! Clean & enjoyable atmosphere .. Will recommend & return soon"}
{"text":"I use to really like this place but something tonight was just off.  I have been thinking about it all night and can't put my finger on it.    It started out very slow and quiet for a Friday night.  There were two other tables with guests downstairs and a few upstairs at the bar where a performer was singing Neil Diamond   We started out with the Bruschetta plate.  Good selection of toppings but the bread/toast was too thin and crunchy.  Almost like a cracker.    I had the Filet Mignon, with Bernaise and pepper sauce.  Good cut of meat, cooked medium rare, which left lots of juices to to be soaked up with my side of Parmesan Risotto and the house bread. Risotto wasn't too hard or too mushy and tasted very good.  Katherine wasn't very hungry and had a small plate of the veal meatballs and Parmesan risotto.  She said the meatballs were very soft and tender.  She doesn't like a meatball that hard to cut in to.  Spices for the meatballs were not too much and just enough to get a taste of Italy.   Finished with small piece of tiramisu and the staffs favorite cinnamon roll with ice cream on top.  Warm, gooey with lots of sugar and cream... Good choice but paying for it this morning when I hit the gym.    Staff was friendly, attentive, and food delivered promptly.  Will go again but feel the atmosphere has changed... maybe because of the several other great restaurants in the Kierland and Scottsdale Quarter area."}
{"text":"I have had mixed results at Bobby's, but things appear to be looking up!  The food is relatively average, but the service is VERY good.  The live music makes it a good go-to place at Kierland.  Recommended."}
{"text":"This is truly a three star restaurant and if I had to do it all again, I'd probably go someplace else to spend this kind of money.  It's a beautiful, if somewhat cramped restaurant.  We ate upstairs where a duo with a electric keyboard and Gibson guitar put out Moondance and jazzy versions of standards, nice but only boardered on jazz (IMHO).  We were there with a group of six and the conversation sustained us over the 70 minutes it took to get out entrees out to us.  Ordered bruschette, $10 for three melba toast covered samples, not a good value.  Had to ask for bread to sustain us while the entrees were coming, no butter, it took two requests.  I had two Jack and cokes, one came in a collins glass, straight, the second one came in a rocks glass with a lime.-no consistency.  We asked to order the web special (3 courses for $30 and the waitress had to go get a separate menu for us.)  The food was simply ok, nothing special.  My filet was good but I was served the well done request from the other end of the table and that person got my medium rare (she wasn't thrilled). Phoenix is starting to have some very nice, quality restaurants and Bobby's isn't quite there yet.  They may get there, definitly will take some focus and maybe new or improved management.  Enjoyed Stephanie our waitress, she was very pleasant."}
{"text":"It is usually a challenge to find parking in Kierland so we figured it was a sign when there was a spot right in front of Bobby's. Unfortunately that was not the case with our lunch last Sunday. Lets start with the $11 top shelf Bloody Mary. It was weak and unimaginative. No celery, lime or lemon, no salted rim. just a lone, tiny olive on a fancy toothpick. My wife ordered the spinach fig salad and the butternut squash ravioli. The salad was bland and unimaginative with thinly sliced dried figs. The 4 raviolis looked to be reheated in a microwave with some sort of an oily concoction slathered over the plate. My fish was the biggest disappointment. Halibut that looked like it came out of the frozen section of Wal-Mart. Cooked to death and than drowned in a lemon and caper sauce that was so salty it was inedible. It was supposed to come with choice of wild rice or pasta. Mine came with last nights pasta in tomato sauce. Now lets talk about the stellar service. The hostess looked at us like we were from outer space when we entered as she sipped on her Jamba Juice. The total conversation with the waiter consisted of; \"Do you want something to drink?\" \"Are you ready to order?\" \"Finished?\" He didn't dare ask if we enjoyed our meal. I'm sure that was based on the full plates he cleared from the table. If there was a -Star option this experience would have been a resounding minus 5"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had date night here recently and we had an EXCELLENT experience. We decided to try someplace new as some of our old places were getting a bit old hat. Bobby's was classy, the staff was VERY friendly, and the food was DELISH! I think the only thing I would change is calling it a Jazz Lounge because there wasn't one note of jazz that played during our time there, but if that's the worst thing...so be it.  My husband and I shared the hummus appetizer. The crackers were interesting, but the veggies were fresh, crisp and perfect with the hummus. I had the chicken and fusilli and it was excellent. It wasn't overly saucy and was plentiful with chicken. I believe my husband had steak but honestly, I was so focused on my dish...it was amazing. I know he enjoyed whatever it was he had but for the life of me, I can't remember. We did enjoy the raspberry mousse for dessert which was creamy and just heavenly.   Our server was wonderful...friendly, kind, and gave perfect service. He was truly very nice and made our visit one that was quite memorable.  I'm looking forward to coming back for a future date night!"}
{"text":"Love is place. Yummy and fun:) Marcos is truly wonderful. He really caters to you and is very professional. However I did not have a very good experience with the waitress Teresa. She rushes you and seems like its putting her out to wait on you. She scoops up your food before your finished and spends more time talking to the customers leaving instead of the ones in the chair. So i sit with my empty wine glass for a while . So I always call ahead to make sure she is not working.  I recommend asking for Marcos and you will be counting the minutes until you can return. Great food and very nice atmosphere. Yummy wine selection.I had  Shrimp cocktail, Cesar salad with grilled shrimp. The shrimp is always cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Celebrating Valentines Day here, and from start to finish the service was outstanding.  Our server was Marcos, he knew the menu inside and out, he was very attentive, and kept our wine glasses full.  I had the filet mignon with asparagus, both were cooked to perfection, and melt in your mouth.  We finished with the almond cake for dessert, and it was to die for.  This was our first time here, and we tried it out with a Groupon.  We are now fans, and will for sure be back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent at this restaurant. I had the little pasta purses and I would have gobbled up every single one but they were competing with the bottle of wine and the salad that I share with my friend. The salad was also excellent. if they weren't having a half-priced wine sale I would say the wine here would have been too overpriced for me. The interior decoration was... how you say... ODD. Can't quite figure out what exactly they were going for. And the jazz that night was soooo horrible. I hope it was horrible on purpose because no one should have to be subjected to \"Uptown Girl\" done in bad jazz. :( Service was not consistent. There was a really overly wanting to please guy. And then a guy that kept looking at us but never really responding. And then our waiter who was more interested in the table next to us. And the the manager who rushed about angrily. But we did get all of our food in a timely manner and they refilled our glasses once.  So go for the food, but not for the music."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was in town and i wanted to celebrate his birthday at a good restaurant. We decided to go to Bobby's big MISTAKE!  Here is why  *We had made reservations but our reservations were never taken. There was only one table with people in the whole restaurant but we were given a table that wasnot setup. This was not a big deal initially but we were just ignored for awhile after we were ready to order. We waited for over 20minutes.  *Our waitress who we later found out was Fran would dissappear for long periods of time we could hear her talking to the hostess somewhere in the back but she would could not contact her.   *Our food was cold when we got it. After  nibbling alittle and were ready to leave she was no where to be found. I had to get off our seat to go look for her.  Staff here is not the best. The restaurant has a good ambience and good details."}
{"text":"So I had just gotten back from Barcelona (not the restaurant, the city) and fell in love with Spanish food. So when I came here I saw squid ink ravioli with lobster cream sauce. YUM! I'm all over it. Sadly, my poor friend had extreme morning sickness so I could not get all the unique items and we had to dine and run. but i would definitely go back and order a cocktail and eat this again. i love the ambiance, very modern and fun. Good for girls night out."}
{"text":"If there was a negative stars for this I would give it....do NOT go for lunch. We were not greeted at the door at all and had to walk around the place just to find someone who worked there.... That should have been our first clue.....when the man did seat us he smelled so bad of Cologne that we almost left before we even ordered......2 more couples walked in and stood and waited for someone to notice them, but the waiter was too busy chatting it up with the cook to notice, and I certainly wasn't about to tell him he had customers.....not my job, sorry. The lunch was just meh....the soda was flat and tasted funny, and the cheese steak was substandard at best...... Maybe if there  is nobody at the door to greet you at what appears to be a nice place it will be the clue to just walk out......I won't be returning again."}
{"text":"The food is great and the drinks are reasonable during Happy Hour only. Happy Hour lasts until 7 here - which is nice. They have half off appetizers and drinks and that makes up for everything being so over priced any other time.  Great atmosphere for a date."}
{"text":"I've been here for both dinner and lunch - at lunch, the food is still good, but it was empty and kind of awkward. The unique decor really shines at night and the menu seems more appropriate as well. I had a delicious seabass picatta served with gnocchi. The service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I actually can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  Very nice atmosphere, wonderful food.  Haven't been here for drinks, only dinner twice, and both times we sat upstairs.  Someone else said the music was too loud, but we didn't find it so, perhaps because we were seated by the railing, away from the speakers.  My wife had what could only be described as a sampler:  pieces of 3 different meats, beef, veal and lamb.  It was a nightly special, so not on their menu, but all the individual parts of it are, and all were fabulous.  I had the veal marsala, which was also very good, as was the escargot."}
{"text":"This was AWESOME! The food was good the service was GREAT and the atmosphere is second to none! Even having a table of 9 people 5ft away from us the aucoustics in the restaurant are perfect, you could barely even hear them talking which made it very comfortable."}
{"text":"I'll start with the service.  It was excellent.  Next up, the cocktails.  My husband had the  Mojito Martini.  He's pretty hard to please when it mojitos, but he said it was pretty good.  I had the Sangria.  It was just okay, so I moved on to wine.  Now for the, the app.  We had escargot.  It was very tasty with plenty of garlic which we really like. On to the entrées.  I had the lobster ravioli.  It was good.   Lots of lobster, but the pasta was a little thick.  Just something to note.  It's very hardy and filling.  As for the jazz, we were seated downstairs and the music is upstairs, so it wasn't really a part of then atmosphere for us. Again, the service was great!"}
{"text":"great food, awesome music...service could be better (since it was a saturday night and the place was packed...I am not going to hold it against them too much)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!! My boyfriend organized a wonderful birthday dinner for me with a group of 23 people at Bobby's. As people arrived the server not only didn't introduce himself but did not even offer people arriving a drink. My friends were going up to the bar to get their drinks. Water was not topped off and it took 2 hours before anybody got any of their food. When people complained to the manager she was rude and defensive and didn't seem to care. My boyfriend also had a friend make cupcakes for everybody and they had the gaul to charge $1 per person per cupcake just to serve them!! After spending so much money there as a group I find it unfathomable that a restaurant would do this. The server (and manager) made it seem like we were the first large group that ever were to frequent their establishment, with the server telling us he didn't want to take orders without knowing who was going to be on separate checks. And even after saying that at the beginning and appearing to have it organized, all my friends at the end of the night were literally in line at their cash register telling them what they ordered so they could separate it from he bill. WTH is this Denny's or what?!?! To top it off, we were short over $200 at the end of he night and the manager refused to itemize the bill for us so we could see what wasn't paid for. My friends are not cheap and there is no way we were short that amount of money....pretty sure they eff'd the bill up by not subtracting people as we went along.   The only saving grace was that most of the food was pretty good (I had the Lobster ravioli and my boyfrIend had the clam linguini)..my friends who ordered the burgers said they were awful so maybe stay away from them. I asked them if they told the waiter about the burgers and they said nobody once asked how their food was. Figured. The owner of this restaurant really needs to re-evaluate he staff before this restaurant sinks hard and fast!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to eat here - very good atmosphere and surrounded by very, very good eating options in Kierland Commons. Once we were seated my wife and I ordered and it was all downhill from there.  We got the caprase salad - one of the most simple, fantastic foods on the planet. What we got, a very strange garden salad, with 4 low quality tomato slices and 4 pieces of mozzarella cheese covered in a very nasty \"basil dressing.\" Somehow a 5 ingredient classic was turned into a complete mess.  Also ordered a pink lemonade drink and the Sangria. Lemonade drink tasted like minute maid and came without a stirring straw so all the ingredients were separated. The sangria (that the bartender is very proud of) tasted like grape juice and booze... There was no actual fruit in the sangria.  On to the main course, gnocchi soaked in a sweet red sauce and overlooked angle hair pasta covered in overcooked tomatos. We managed about 3 bites and called it. The best way to explain these dishes is they are cooked by an Italian that has never been to Italy.  We paid our Benjamin and got the hell out of Bobby's at that point (which was also due to the server who rushed us from the moment we sat down).  And one last thing, we were excited to see some live Jazz, there was never any live music, just a guy occasionally doing a keyboard sound check.   Kierland Commons is packed with great eating options. Do not waste your time or money at Bobby's."}
{"text":"Italian at it's best! Mama great old recipes. Wife told me it was the best lasagna she's ever had, my cannelloni was unreality good."}
{"text":"This is a one of a kind restaurant. It's sexy, romantic and hip. The food is fabulous and the service impeccable. I am gluten intolerant and they couldn't have been more accommodating. The staff is very attentive and friendly. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"DO NOT go here. Raw Oysters came out warm, the calamari was rubber, and the Mac and cheese had fake cheese. The service was also terrible. Never again Bobby."}
{"text":"2 starTonight my fiancé and I ordered from Bobby's via Grubhub. GrubHub was fast and assisted to the point of calling me and stating that Bobby's was out of Creme Brûlée on a FRIDAY NIGHT! So we ordered the tiramisu, brownie and ice cream, and a small plate of meatballs. When I brought the bags home and opened them we were VERY disappointed! I have attached photos of the serving portions of the desserts. My fiancé called and a woman answered, we asked to speak to the manager in regards to the portion sizes of the dessert. She stated she was who we would be able to speak to regarding this issue.We simply wanted to give our feedback for in both of our careers feedback is greatly appreciated. She apologized however went into a defensive frenzy stating that GrubHub charges more for the portions and the kitchen stated they were proper portion. My fiancé reiterated that he wanted to give feedback. The woman stated \"Have a good night\" and hung up. We wanted to be acknowledged and appreciated for calling to simply give feedback of the dessert. Unfortunately, we did not obtain that customer service from that woman. After being hung up on we called back three times with no answer from the restaurant. We then called from another number where our phone call was immediately answered. Seems to us that we went out of our way to give our feedback to Bobbys on our disappointment but it does not seem as though they care to hear it. This was NOT a bad dining experience it was the bad customer service we received. The food was delicious but the portion size was our ONLY disappointment. The manager said she was \"busy\" when we stated we called back three times with no answer. This was a very long post however detail is necessary and we appreciate you reading this post."}
{"text":"We came for happy hour, everything was ok not very hight quality, they have live music it was very nice"}
{"text":"The worst food ever, not your typical scottsdale high end place, besides the ambience everything else is horrible. Food was awful, group of 16 and none of us were please, everything was either cold or tasteless, I almost believe it was from the awl-mart frozen section! live music was nice, i would only go there for drinks! Should have been obvious when there was just another couple besides our group on a \"busy\" saturday night! Will NOT recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Bobby's is a true delight, with happy hour everyday of the week you can get high quality food for not a small fortune.  If you have the opportunity sit upstairs as it has better ambiance and you are right there for the live music.  We have been multiple times and the music is always great!  There seafood always taste super fresh and I usually always go that route.  Last time it was my wife's birthday and we got treated to a complimentary desert that feed all four of us!"}
{"text":"Nice Atmo.  Great Service.  Iffy Food.  My Manhattan was probably the highlight of the evening... Bobby's is a nice place if you're into appearances and stylish decor.  Our group ordered a variety of dishes from the appetizer, salad, pasta, entree and dessert menus.  Food was decent but missed a certain \"something\" that makes you want to rave about it.  Having had butternut squash ravioli two nights in a row with Bobby's as the 2nd night, I'd say their butternut ravioli is nothing to write home about.    The pluses: great cocktails, great bread, good dessert. The minuses:  chef substituting out the main ingredient on your dinner and not being told about it, the wine list is average at best.  This is probably a better happy hour establishment than it is for supper.  And ladies, take a very small purse.  There's nowhere to hang them on the chairs and no place on the table.  You'll be setting them on the floor or behind your tush."}
{"text":"Ordered out from here. Try the seafood paella! Surprisingly tasty! Their fish dishes are also a win too."}
{"text":"Since my husband was out of town for Thanksgiving and because I don't like turkey or most other Thankgiving food, a girlfriend and I decided to go out to dinner for Thankgiving. We chose Bobby's because it was one of the few places we found that in addition to a special Thanksgiving menu, they were also offering their regular menu. Apparently quite a few other people had the same idea as us because when we arrived for our 4 pm reservations, both the downstairs and upstairs had significant crowds.  We were seated upstairs which is the lounge. The lighting was perfect and my friend and I both enjoyed the metal chain curtains that surround the space. The piano player was amazing and set a great tone for the space and our meal. Plus anytime I get to hear good Billy Joel covers, I am happy! Service was good - when we asked a busboy for olive oil as our table didn't have any, he was quick to get it for us and our waitress was very sweet and did a great job despite being double or triple sat.  On to the food...my friend and I both started with the caesar salad which was a good way to start our meal. My only complaint is that it came with anchovies on it - now I have ate many a caesar salad in my day and most places that serve it with anchovies list that they do in the menu, so it was quite a surprise when our salads came out with anchovies since it wasn't stated in the menu. Being one not to complain over something so minor, I picked them off and ate every bite of the salad - I especially like the seasoned croutons. For my dinner, I had the pesto chicken sandwich which was really good. The chicken was perfect and the sandwich was quite thick, so I wasn't able to finish it all. I especially liked how they used mozzarella on the sandwich which I think gave it just that little extra umph to make it really good. My girlfriend enjoyed her scallops that she ordered - she said they were cooked well and were not too chewy at all. For dessert we shared a slice of yellow cake with a cheesecake type filling. DELICIOUS! Despite being a tad full from our dinners, we still managed to eat every bite. Our bill came to $88 before tip (we also each had a glass of wine) which we did not think was bad at all.  If you are in the Kierland area, Bobby's is a nice choice for a meal or even just to stop in to have a drink or two. I would recommend sitting upstairs as I liked the atmosphere up there quite a bit, and if you were downstairs, I think you would just be a bit too separated from the music and ambiance the establishment is trying to project."}
{"text":"I chose Bobby's for the combo of live jazz and steak - perfect for our anniversary dinner, which is very special to us. We always dress up and don't worry too much about the bill. And for $36 per steak, I expected a level of quality and service that we had experienced at places like Morton's. Ah, no. Not even close.  I made the reservation on Yelp's Seatme and specified that it was a special occasion - our anniversary. We arrived promptly and asked to be seated near the live musicians. Not possible - the entire upper level was reserved for a private party. We gladly accepted a booth (round table) on the ground floor instead, and we could hear the music clearly but still hear each other. Noise level was just right. My first hint that this wasn't an upscale restaurant was when the hostess seated us and laid the two large menus on the opposite side of the table and left before we had scooted into the booth. So I got up and reached across the table and retrieved the menus.  The waiter buzzed up to our table and said, \"Anything but water to drink?\" We had barely got the words \"Diet Coke\" out of our mouths before he buzzed away again. For the rest of the evening, he buzzed by the table at top speed, a stressed-out look on his face, no smiles, no friendly greeting, no warmth at all. When I asked him to take our picture because it was our anniversary, I could see his hesitation and hear his sigh, telling me by his actions and expression very clearly that he was too busy for such nonsense. He did it anyway, reluctantly - snapped one quick shot with no flash (my fault), didn't say congratulations or acknowledge our occasion in any way, and sped away again.  When I placed my order, I got confused between the NY strip steak and the rib-eye, and he sighed again and wasn't helpful but almost argumentative - clearly stressed and rushed. We asked him whether bread would be brought to our table, and his clipped response was, \"It's on its way.\" When it didn't show up after a reasonable time, I asked again, and again he snapped, \"It's on its way.\" Finally, we got a basket of very good chunks of french bread with garlic butter toasted on.  My small caesar salad ($6) was delicious, despite the big slab of anchovy across the top. That was a first - quite unappetizing to look at. My large baked potato ($6 as a side) had that slight off flavor that indicated it had been sitting in a warmer for a while. My NY strip steak (10 oz. for $36) that I ordered medium-well was cooked well done, with only the tiniest bit of pale gray-pink in the very center, and had very little flavor. Nothing about this $36 steak was melt-in-your-mouth tender or flavorful. Although I tried to eat it, I ended up leaving about 3/4 of it on my plate. I was trying to chew a piece when the waiter sped by and asked how everything was and didn't wait for me to chew, swallow, and reply, but sped off again after my husband said his was fine.  At one point between salads and entree, I asked the waiter to take another photo of us with the flash, and he waved to the waitress who was refilling our drinks and snapped, \"I think she'll do it\" and walked off. She did. At no time did anyone ever acknowledge our anniversary.  When the check came, the waiter asked if I wanted a box for my leftover steak, and I said, \"It really wasn't very good.\" He asked what was wrong, and I said it was overdone for being medium-well. He started to say something, as if he were ready to argue with me over the meaning of \"medium-well,\" but must have thought better of it. Instead he said he'd talk to the manager. When he brought us our check, they had removed the cost of the steak. The manager never came to our table to chat with us, ask how anything was, or apologize for the quality of the steak. We were never offered the dessert menu or a look at the dessert tray.  I tipped a full 20% despite feeling like we'd been rushed, ignored, and treated with a cold shoulder throughout the meal. I will never go back. There is so much the staff could have done to show us a good time, and simply being friendly would have been a great start. I couldn't wait to get out of there and head for Cheesecake Factory to finish off our meal. And like always, at CF we were greeted and treated like valued customers, not rushed, and felt welcome."}
{"text":"Looking for business lunch place somewhere new for me and this place came up. First thought... Only 3 stars? I read several reviews and most of negative comments were at dinner/happy hour time, but some of them seemed to be good with food taste, so I decided to try.   Walking in, I thought they have interesting decor. Looks like fun place to hangout in the evening. Sunny November afternoon, most people were dining at the patio. We chose to sit inside.  Service was prompt. We had our water, bread, and oil and vinegar before we had chance to look at the menu. I really liked their oil and vinegar bottle.  I started crab stuffed mushrooms for appetizer.  First bite of Cheesy sauce, I thought of cruise ship dinner. I probably ate something similar at cruise. I really liked it. Can't go wrong with cheesy sauce, crabs and mushrooms.  For lunch, I ordered crab salad a half size. I know... Crab and crab but they are cooked so differently, taste different. A half size salad was just right amount of volume after eating appetizer.  I was going to skip the desert but when she brought the tray, how could anyone resist? I spotted my usual tiramisu but considering I needed to control my weight, I went for mango cheesecake. I am not sure if cheesecake has less calories or not but at that moment, I thought mango cheesecake may be a healthier option...  Their espresso was very good, I enjoyed a cup of real coffee with my desert.  They weren't too busy at all when we were there and we were able to discuss what we needed. I will add this place as my business lunch option."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Food was so-so. Music is also good. Drinks were tasty. Sit upstairs where the band is."}
{"text":"We headed out to Bobby's Friday night at the request of a friend who wanted to hang out and listen to live music for her b-day. We had reservations for 8Pm and they seated us promptly. The atmosphere was cool and relaxing, and the music was entertaining. The environment is a little to loud with the music and back ground noise to carry on a conversation.   On the food side of thing, my wife and I ordered the steamed muscles in the white wine sauce. The sauce was very well done with what seemed to be white wine, lemon, parsley, and either a touch of tomato past for color of just a little tomato sauce. The flavor was great. The muscles on the other hand were over cooked and rubbery.   For our main courses my wife ordered the Cesar salad with shrimp. The Cesar was ok, the dressing was a little on the lite side, not very tangy. The shrimp were small maybe 41/50's and it was $7 extra for THREE. The wife didn't realize that there was only three until after she had given one to a friend at the table to try.   I ordered the angel hair pasta with shrimp in a white wine tomato sauce. I can just say that it was average. Nothing over the top or exciting. I too only got three shrimp for $7 and was a little disappointed.   All in all the food was average but below average for an upscale place. The night was saved by the music and my wife was happy that I got up and danced with her."}
{"text":"Friday night during prime time for snowbirds is a tough time to find somewhere to eat when you don't want to wait and you don't have a reservation somewhere.  We learned this the hard way last week...   My parents decided that Kierland Commons would be a good place to meet my brother and I for dinner.  PF Changs is where they told us to meet.  I suggested they get there early as there would be a wait.  Did they listen? Nope!  So as I am pulling into the parking lot I get a call on my cell phone from my mom saying the wait at PF Changs is over an hour... and then my brother told me to meet them at Bobby's instead.  \"Yikes - I think i may be under dressed for Bobby's\" is what I was thinking... afterall, I was in a t-shirt and jeans and flip flops.  Oh well...  I walked in and upstairs where I found my family seated in the lounge area.  At least we didn't have to wait!  I was under-impressed with the service and food - especially for the prices.  The music in the lounge made it difficult to hear each other, and normally, I love music... but it was just ok.  The waitress needed to be reminded about my drink, but she was pleasant.   My mom enjoyed her seared ahi tuna salad, my dad and brother both licked their plates clean and commented on the generous servings for the lobster fra diavolo, and I had the chilean seabass - go figure!  I would not order the sea bass again... the mango relish was not so appealing in my opinion, but I would return for happy hour or if someone else was footing the bill.   Like Jane A said in her review, \"this place did not 'wow' me... it was just good.\""}
{"text":"2014 New Year's Eve dinner.  Excellent.  To the other reviewers who did not enjoy the Bobby's experience, sorry to hear that.  We had a wonderful time.  Marcos, our waiter was attentive and friendly.  He gave us some very good personal recommendations on wine and entrees, and he was spot on.  Service was prompt without being too fast.  Our food choices were outstanding.  We share pretty much everything, and it was all good.  We did an on-line reservation and were pleasantly surprised to be provided a booth although there were other available 2 seaters around.    After dinner, we also went upstairs to check out the lounge.  A couple was singing popular songs.  The gal had an outstanding voice, and the guy behind the piano was also excellent.  All in all, we had a great experience.  Our first time there with just info on-line, and we would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I didn't come away wowed but it was a good experience. Menu has quite a variety and the live jazz was pretty cool, but I don't know, something was lacking. The oysters we had were a little smallish, I split a Caesar salad as well. Dressing needed a little more to it, felt a little bland. Fortunately it came with anchovies to give it more of a Caesar feel. Had the Lobster Fra Diavlo for the main course... think cioppino with a little kick to it. Had half a small lobster tail, mussels, clams, a couple of large shrimp and some fettucini noodles mixed in. Wasn't super filling but it wasn't bad either. Had a darn good bottle of wine though, a 2000 Elk Cove Pinot Gris. In the end it felt like an average meal with typical service. Might try the meat if I get a chance to go back. A few other reviewers raved about the steaks. The specials they offered the night I was there were pretty creative but I just wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"Delicious food and beautiful place! And the jazz and decor totally sets the stage for a nice evening.   I ate here a few weeks ago on a double date. We all enjoyed our meals. My date had the lamb chops and I ordered the halibut.   The pink lemonade (alcoholic) is tasty but misleading. Sip slowly. lol. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm torn...torn I tell you.  I wanted to love Bobby's...I really did.  I wanted to give it at least one more star....but, alas, I can't.  Let's start with the good. Shall we?  I think we shall.  As I walked into Bobby's I was struck by how tastefully decorated it was. Very classy, very courteous hostesses who took care of us even on a Saturday night without a reservation. We sat outside with plenty of heaters available to keep even the cold-blooded members of our party very comfortable.  The food was really deserving of 4 stars. Excellent bread brought to the table, very good food. I had the paella. Some of the better paella I've had in awhile. One of my dinner companions said, \"Not to the level of paella I had in Spain, but very good.\"  Fresh quality ingredients, and about the perfect amount. Not a skimpy dish. I also tried the grilled sea-bass, and the swordfish. I would order either one of these also with no fear. Both excellent.  My Grey Goose slightly dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives was also perfect! :)  Now for the not so good. Wait staff was very friendly but not particularly efficient. Even after noting that it was a Saturday evening, still a little slow.  One of the dinners was burnt in the kitchen, so we were informed by the manager (very nice) that her sea bass would be delayed. Not a big deal, things happen. My biggest problem is the music. It says all over the place that they have live jazz. Since when do tired old Motown classics count as jazz? I didn't hear any jazz that night.  Just some R&B covers sung marginally.   So....will I go there again? Yes.  Will it be for the music? Not likely...I'll be going for the food!  LOL"}
{"text":"I was wanting to come here for awhile and we finally made it in! THe food and service was great. The place was busy but our service was fantastic and never really had to wait or want for anything. We dined upstairs with a view down that still felt intimate and fun. The salmon was excellent. Plan on going back very soon."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Everyone who works here has an attitude and is not accommodating!!!! Olive Garden tastes better then the food they serve here. Deals are also misleading. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is excellent, the atmosphere is fabulous!  Went there for a girls night out and we were treated to a wait staff of all very handsome men!  They were courtesy and attentive and that, along with the decor, music and food made it a terrific night out!"}
{"text":"Four of us stopped in for lunch on Saturday, November 26 at approximately 1:00PM.  Well, we didn't even end up staying to eat because the restaurant was staffed with only 1 server and 1 hostess - both of which were completely un-attentive, and almost rude.  We decided to get up and leave after sitting in our booth for 20 minutes, completely ignored.  The hostess stood there, looking into the restaurant while the server ran around trying to manage the 6 tables that had people at them.  Not once did the hostess or the server come over to re-assure us that we would be taken care of, or apologize for the wait, etc.  While the employees annoyed us, I find it hard to believe that management would staff the restaurant like this at lunch time on one of the busiest shopping days of the year.  I was embarrassed after telling my parents that we would be taking them to somewhere special for lunch while shopping.  It was ridiculous and a waste of our time."}
{"text":"While the food and atmosphere here is great, the service is atrocious. We hosted a holiday party here and the server was horribly inattentive and rude. An 18% gratuity was factored into the bill and she did not earn it by any right.  Having worked in a restaurant before, I was insulted that she felt her behavior was acceptable. She came to the table a total of 4 times over the course of three hours, never introduced herself to the table and responded with nothing but sarcasm and brashness.  She basically ruined the experience for our entire party.  Also, be forewarned, we ordered a bottle of wine for $230. The mark up was ten times! That's right. They served us a $21 bottle of wine and charged us $230. All of their alcohol was over priced and terribly made.  All 12 members of our party voiced they would not be returning to Bobby's. I'm sorry - but crappy service and disrespectful markups definitely overshadowed the dinner."}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon we found this place.  Located at the Kierland shopping center and tucked away on the Southern side of the area, it's not an easy place to find.  The entrance is not in a high traffic area....I hope they can stay open with this handicap.  It's a 2 level restaurant with the main dining room on the 1st floor and the lounge with live entertainment on the 2nd floor.  We opted to dine on the 2nd floor and listen to the entertainer....he was a one man show playing a keyboard and singing jazz tunes...he was ok.  After browsing the menu, we opted for:  Wedge Salad, $8 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=RE9cSGRSgIMWiINEvBDuyw#RE9cSGRSgIMWiINEvBDuyw  Escargot, $12.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=exaKPAULLoKK3UiMswa45g#exaKPAULLoKK3UiMswa45g  Gnocchi & Veal Meatballs, $19.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=jEw_PDJRRRaxT87FNMBGIg#jEw_PDJRRRaxT87FNMBGIg  Duckling (Half Bone-In, Wild Rice, Vegetables), $25.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=rJOCFs1iVgbyUMSgQBpdeA#rJOCFs1iVgbyUMSgQBpdeA  Tiramisu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=Gvhvnst10z0y1-UeO22Ntg#Gvhvnst10z0y1-UeO22Ntg  Almond Cake http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bobbys-restaurant-and-jazz-lounge-scottsdale-2?select=5xbnXGSOc6Ly-rnw7rRV1Q#5xbnXGSOc6Ly-rnw7rRV1Q  I love Wedge Salad....and they do it well here...it was very good.  The Wife had the Escargot and loved it....I'm not a fan.  She had the Duckling and also loved it....I had a bite and it was moist and full of flavor.  My dish was the Gnocchi w/Veal Meatballs....that dish was ridiculously good.  The Sauce was rich and creamy and the Veal Meatballs were awesome.  For dessert, we ordered Tiramisu and Almond Cake....we didn't need the calories, but it was worth it....they were both good.  Of course we downed a bottle of Wine with dinner and a glass of Port with dessert.  Service was excellent throughout dinner.  We'd love to come back....just hoping they can overcome their bad location.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service from manager.  Encountered this once before from her.  She was rude and insulting to say the least.  If there are more than 4 of you, she can't handle it.  Food was OK and waitresses were fine.  Gave her extra tip because of her service and who she has to work for.  We won't go there again!!"}
{"text":"My husband claims he ate the best steak in his life near!!  I had pork tenderloin that was a bit overcooked but flavorful with a balsamic drizzle.  The prices were expensive - but we decided we were paying for the ambiance which was unique in MANY ways....  We would make a return trip..."}
{"text":"Staying at the Westin, and a walk over, and sat on patio for dinner, but wanted to be closer to music so we went upstairs, Service was excellent, she only had a appetizer, I went all out 12oz Lobster Tail, and Pasta Dish with Shrimp, and a bottle of wine, and save room for choc. brownie  Hit the spot, and bill under $200, but when food, company, and everything is perfect then it is worth it.  Will be back, had live music, but was a slow night  customer wise."}
{"text":"Went to Bobby's just recently with a group of people from work, we all had a great time.  We sat at the romantically decorated lounge located upstairs and drank a few drinks while we talked and listened to the pianist.  Everyone ordered food and everyone had great things to say about it.  Food presentation was well, food tasted great, and the service was wonderful.  I am definitely taking another trip back to Bobby's when in Scottsdale.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I found the food to be great here! The atmosphere and decor is really nice and inviting...the band they had the night we went was a pretty typical cover band...nothing I would classify as jazz by any means, they played a lot of karaoke favorites, such as Georgia, Can't Take My Eyes Off You, Bon Jovi hits, etc.  We had a reservation for 8:30pm for five people and about halfway into the drive realized we would be about 10 minutes late, so I called the restaurant and asked if that would be a problem. They assured me that it was not, since the table that we would have was still occupied.   When we arrived at exactly 8:39pm, the hostess quickly apologized and said that when we called, someone accidentally marked our names as being \"seated\" so they had marked us off of the list and our table was now gone. She told us not to worry because they would have a table ready for us in about 5-10 minutes, they just needed to clean and set it.  30 minutes later, we were still waiting for a table, after numerous other parties were seated before us.Again, we were reassured that it would be only another 5 minutes or so. 15 minutes later, we were finally told that they were setting our table right then.  When finally seated, we were all famished and asked the server if we could order some appetizers right away to get started. He rushed around, only taking drink orders of two of the five people at our table, never taking any appetizer orders from us. We started calling him Speedy Gonzales, because he would literally appear and disappear before we even knew what was going on.  Our server ended up talking us out of any appetizers because he said they weren't worth the price and were very small, then disappeared again.  We were finally able to order and our food arrived about 20 minutes later...and again, I will say that the food was great, well presented and tasty.  The service is what lowers the rating for this establishment. Might be a place to try midweek when they aren't as busy?"}
{"text":"How many Bobby's do you have Arizona?  We continued on our Bobby theme after an awesome meal from Bobby Q's and wanted to check out this restaurant recommended by the Westin. For this meal it was decided our friends would choose so no pre-yelp research. We went in blind not knowing what type of food it was, if it was child-friendly or not, what price range, and how it rated.  Walking in I was immediately concerned seeing how trendy it was with white linen tables and wine glasses set on the tables and thought \"uh oh...maybe not so child-friendly even for lunch\". However, they sat us in a booth without linens and provided one kids menu so it seemed ok. We quickly realized it was Italian and we were all excited since our last Italian meal was a flop.   Kids menu:  - Mac and cheese - chicken tender with fries  Lunch menu: - meatball sandwich with Caesar salad - linguini with red clam  A warm basket of cheesy garlic bread was brought out and within seconds it was gone.  It was pretty tasty and a great way to keep the kiddos happy before their entrees came out. We ordered two more baskets of cheesy bread.  Mac and cheese was a hit and although it was a kids meal, no additional sides were provided.  We got a thumbs up!   Chicken tenders came with three pieces of chicken and fries. It looked good although our son fell asleep after the meal so no comment.  Meatball sandwich was a big hefty sandwich. The bread was very soft yet durable enough to hold the large meatball pieces. It was topped with yummy melted cheese but I found the sauce to be minimal. It helped to keep the sandwich clean but tasted a little dry with such little sauce.  The Caesar salad, on the other hand, was drenched with dressing and had way too much Parmesan. I took a few bites and decided not to eat any more.  My husband Loves loves loves a good linguini with clam in red sauce and he said this dish was excellent. After trying a little I agree. The sauce was right on, the linguini was cooked perfectly and there were plenty of clams inside. He was very happy clam.  Our friends ordered pesto chicken pasta and they were also very pleased with their dish.  As a Westin guest we got to choose a complimentary dessert so we picked the almond cake and our friends picked the brownie with ice cream. The brownie was warm and homemade. It was delicious. The almond cake was light and a perfect way to end our meal.  Overall we were pretty content with our experience at Bobby's for lunch. The price range is $ to $$ for lunch which is reasonable. Service was great despite some delay receiving our entrees."}
{"text":"Place has interesting atmosphere, but the service is sub par and the food is medicore. I've given them a couple of trys. There r much better and fun restaurants to go to. Perhaps someday  the owner will try and notch it up a, couple of notches and become a competitive Scottsdale style restaurant."}
{"text":"Hit this place up while pitching a business looking for funding to a VC. Not the best choice! The mojito martinis we started off with were superb. Everything went downhill from there. The appetizers (escargot, oysters rockefeller and lobster ravioli) were all so sub-par that we decided to skip main entrees."}
{"text":"Love Bobby's!  My husband and I go here on special occasions.  Our service has been amazing and the food is even better.  We normally have a server who is a female in her 20s.  SHE IS SO GOOD.  The only reason I gave the restaurant a 4 instead of a 5 was because the last time we went, we brought my parents who were visiting from out of town, and our server seemed very confused.  For the price you pay, the experience should be top notch.  He didn't offer salad with dinner, and we had to wave him down several times to get things from him."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant. Excellent food, excellent service, excellent entertainment. Can't think of a better place to have date night with my husband. This is truly a great find!"}
{"text":"This place is sexy. Seriously.  The hubs and I were looking for a new happy hour place to drown our sorrows after a particularly rough Cardinals game. Surprisingly Bobby's has a happy hour on Sundays. I was a little apprehensive because the dress code said dressy. We didn't have any clean dress clothes plus I didn't have the energy to get put on anything more than lipgloss. He put on a polo and nice jeans, I put on a sundress and we hoped we wouldn't look too shabby.  Kierland is usually a pain to park in but this day it wasn't bad. Inside was very nice and the lounge upstairs was dark and modern yet had a \"Mad Men\" vibe to it. If there wasn't a smoking ban in AZ I would imagine alot of cigars would be smoked in this place.  And we weren't shunned because of our casual Friday clothing. There were other sundresses and jeans. It was a late Sunday afternoon though. I imagine it would be much dressier on a late Saturday night. There was a live smoooootthh jazz band playing. Wow. The band was great but I am not much of a jazz fan. Jazz puts me to sleep. Luckily there was great food and drinks to revive me.  I had a dirty martini and a mojito martini. Both were great, especially the mojito martini. Very refreshing.  My husband was delighted they had Moose Drool beer. They had a huge selection of happy hour food. Lots of inexpensive seafood options too. I had a Caesar salad and eggplant rolletini. The salad was good and the eggplant was outstanding. The bread basket had some pretty tasty garlic toast.  My husband had a huge pulled pork sandwich with some awesome sweet potato fries. I don't normally like sweet potato fries but these were fantastic.   Service was great. The bartender seemed to be the only person serving the entire lounge with one runner helping but he was still fast, efficient, and friendly.  Happy hour prices were SUCH a bargain. All that food and drink for under forty.   Here is a tip for all the fellas out here- take your date to the lounge. Even if she is not a jazz fan she will be impressed. It is classy, intimate, and not as pretentious and suffocating as some of the other Scottsdale bars and clubs.  And if you are broke, happy hour is perfect. Buy her a $6 martini, share some oysters and olives. You won't secretly freak out when the bill comes. ;)"}
{"text":"I hosted a company dinner and it was excellent.   Food was great, service was great.  I highly recommend Bobby's for official dinners."}
{"text":"My mom took us to lunch for salads. Mom asked to sit outside under an umbrella, and it was a lovely day. I felt a little awkward, though, when we got to the patio and the host (manager?) moved an umbrella away from a different table (without asking) and left the sun to beat down on a woman's head. Luckily, they left shortly after we sat. I ordered a Moose Drool and enjoyed a light breeze, an experience I couldn't have had if I were home in Illinois.   All of the salads were very delicious (see pics). I wanted seared tuna but liked the ingredients on the portobello salad better, so I asked to substitute one salad for the other. (I said I wanted tuna but I'd rather have the stuff that's on the other salad.) I ended up getting both the mushroom and the tuna on the fixings that came with the portobello salad, which was a strange communication error. I ate it all, though, and wanted more. My cousin ordered the salmon salad and loved it, and my mom got the lump crabmeat salad, which she's had before and is her favorite thing on the menu. It has asparagus!   Bobby's is expensive and the half salad is quite small, but the ingredients are fresh and the dressings are perfect. They have good coffee, too. It's an ideal place when someone (like your mom) is paying."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lunch and the place was dead...just me and wifey in a big empty restaurant...AWESOME.  So we started with Crabcak Ravioli, really good, flavorful.  The crabcake was good and crunchy, maybe re-deep fried but couldn't really tell, looked it but didn't taste like it.  So that was a good thing.  The raviolis were very good, delicate and filling was tastey and a lot of it.  Within the rossa sauce were baby shrimp that gave the dish good texture.  Split the house salad, a lot of veggies and good house vinagrette.  For main entree we split the halibut over linguine with same rossa sauce that went on the ravioli, and roasted peppers and baby broccoli....Having the sauce on appetizer and main entree in most places i would call this cheap and easy but the sauce was so good i needed more bread to lap it up, so throughly enjoyed both.  The fish was cooked perfect, moist and flaky.  We had the Lemon Berry cake/tort??  that was the best thing ever, like topping of a berry cobbler, lemon pudding middle, and walnutty tasting carrot cake consistancy cake on the bottom...i ordered another to go, that's how good that was.   Raphael was our server, great guy, fast and attentive (then again we were the only people there for lunch) and made all the choices for us and he was spot on. Don't know how it is at dinner but lunch was great.  Expensive but great...had 3 glasses of wine that started our bill at $30 so a $100 lunch and we split it....that maybe the only gripe i really had."}
{"text":"The owner (Robert M) was gracious enough to follow-up and informed me that the issue had been addressed so I am changing from 1-star to 3-stars. Would love to go higher but need to see what the food and the rest of the service is like. It's great to see a restaurant that pays attention to reviews. Kudos to Robert M."}
{"text":"Cannoli best I ever had. Veal piccata was fabulous as was risotto... wonderful dinner!!!  Service was fantastic attentive and prompt!"}
{"text":"Bobby's is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.   The first night I got there, I went straight to the top of the stairs and had the special. The second night I went there, I had the very same thing. I cannot remember a more satisfying dinner. First impressions are everything.  Apparently, nobody knows Bobby's until you say Bobby Mancuso, who's something of a hotshot in the Valley of the Sun. And fortunately for you, most of the yuppies head to various other fancy restaurants in the Kierland area. For now, you can pretty much walk into Bobby's unannounced and have a first class meal.   Upstairs is just the kind of bar I would put together if I had the money. All top shelf stuff, and and old guy behind the counter. Jazz pianist over in the corner (although this guy had electronics ), room enough to eat at the bar or at small tables, excellent music and the TVs silent.   Bobby's has a serious menu. You can get caviar and Stoli here.  You can get tortilla soup. You can get Clams Casino. Something about Clams Casino that's a touch more classy than Oysters Rockefeller. But you can get them too, or escargot. See what I'm saying? If you want to get to a man like me, you need to know that Ceasar Salad is made with an egg and you *always* put in the anchovies. They obliged me with extra fish.   I had the special steak. I think there was a combo of the Roberto and the Gorgonzola, but I know that I had stuffed prawns with it as well. Oh mama! Like I said, it was incredibly satisfying.   Service at Bobby's is top notch. The staff is attentive, efficient and well-mannered. They're not too pushy or overly dramatic. See, I can already that I like Bobby. He's my kind of guy, and this is just the kind of signature restaurant to have.  You really should splurge here, all the extras are worth it.   I really can't wait until he opens a joint on LA. Or wherever, because it's a long drive from here to there and I really want to see what he can do with Osso Buco."}
{"text":"For a reasons unknown, many people have no idea this place is here!  Chow time- Oh lord have mercy on the Butternut squash ravioli! I could eat this until ... like.. forever! Its incredably, juicy, soft, savory, sweet... oh so great. Its even on happy hour to make it $4.50!! its craziness.  Boozehound- Great bar on the second level, barstaff is professional and fun . Happy to talk and get to know what your up to.There have whipped cream vodka too. Give it a try !  The Look- its stunning when you walk in , great red, and silver bead walls. Huge spiral staircase to the upstairs bar.  Why not five stars? Here is the hell that it Bobbys- if you walk in there around 330, yes they are open, good luck seeing anyone working, no servers no bartenders, oh wait there is a host that will say hi but then not tell you anything or get anyone to help. I have sat many times at the bar and walked out after seeing no one , asking for someone and then someone being annoyed that I wanted to eat so early. Also , they close whenever, after gathering up a group to tell them how much fun this place is.. we got there and they were closed. another time I called and they said they were closed and driving by it was a packed house. Its so agrivating not to know .. or have a specific closing time.  Break it down Jess- I will always go back, just cant stand the GM."}
{"text":"We wanted to go somewhere there was live music playing and Bobby's came up in the search. Neither of us had ever been here before so decided to try it out.  We made a booking a few hours before arriving on a Friday night and lucky we did as there was not a single empty seat. Our waitress was great, super fast and attended to us as soon as we were seated. I ordered a glass of the A for Acacia Pinot Noir and it was amazing. My husband who does not normally drink wine had a sip of this one and ordered another glass. I think he liked it because it was exceptionally smooth no acidic taste that non wine drinkers usually hate.  I actually looked at the menu online before we arrived so knew exactly what I wanted...the Raspberry Duck.....wow.....I have had Orange Duck, Cherry Duck and Blackberry Duck but had yet to try Raspberry Duck.....this was truly delicious and went very well with the Pinot Noir.   My husband ordered the Veal Marsala which he enjoyed but after tasting my Duck said he would be ordering that next time. The sauteed spinach that was served with the Veal Marsala was WAY TOO salty.   The extra side of Sweet Potato Mash with Maple Butter was very good though.  Our desserts of Tiramisu and Cheesecake were awesome : ) and went well with their delicious cappuccino.   The ambience is very fun and original, the music was great on this night and the staff are wonderful."}
{"text":"Never come here as a group.  The service is the worst ever and the food not quite good enough to make up for it.  Empty water glasses, rude waiter, sticky gnocchi."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with the food here, NY steak was flavorless.  Creme brulee was not crisp on top.  Appetizers were pretty good though, I really enjoyed the spinach salad. But if you are looking for a fantastic steak, I would look elsewhere.  Wine by the glass choices were so so but the bottle choices were good. I wouldn't come back here though with so many other impressive restaurants to choose from in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I live in Old Town and had not been up to North Scottsdale in quite a while.  Over the weekend, though, my boyfriend and I stayed at the Westing Kierland with some friends and had to find a place for dinner on Saturday night.  One of our friends found Bobby's online, and, although I'd never heard of it, it sounded promising.  Well, it turned out to be much more than promising, it was exceptional!  First, the decor is very different and trendy without being pretentious.  Our server was very friendly and efficient, even being the only server for our party of seven.  But the main appeal was most certainly the food.  I started with the escargot appetizer.  It was incredibly flavorful with all of the garlic and butter.  There was not a drop of the olive oil mixture that did not get sopped up with bread after the escargot were gone.  For my entree', I had the cannelloni.  I love pasta, and this may have been the best cannelloni I've ever had.  They were very generous with the filling, the noodles had a good consistency, and the sauce was delicious.  You can choose between alfredo and marinara, and I chose both.  I would definitely recommend the \"pink\" sauce to anyone.  I loved this dish so much that I made everyone else at the table taste it!  Other dishes that I tasted were the fillet and the paella, both of which were delicious.  Paella is very hit-or-miss for me, and this was definitely a hit.  My boyfriend's fillet was cooked perfectly.  Our friends also had the lamb chops, which I did not try, but they said they were wonderful.  I don't think there was a single thing amongst the seven of us that was not enjoyed, and that is a hard task.   I would love to return soon!"}
{"text":"The place is very nice and swanky. We had brunch there for Mother's Day today and it was very nice. The main dining room was warm but after they turned down the lights it cooled off. The food was delicious... Eggs Benedict, meatball sandwich, omelets and salads. Every dish ordered was delicious. I got a cinnamon roll to go so will dig into that tonight. Mango mimosas were delicious too. Overall, we will be back. Mancuso never fails to satisfy."}
{"text":"Wanted to sit in the sun and enjoy a meal. service was quick, excellent and helpful. We ordered a chopped salad and the seafood paelle. Both were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I went here with my Toastmasters club for the officers' meeting.  I was very impressed with the quality of service given to my group.  Waitstaff was highly attentive and made sure everyone was comfortable.  The calamari at this restaurant was among the best I have eaten in the Valley of the Sun.  The presentation of the entrees and quality of food was equivalent to some of the restaurants I have been to in Chicago.  My wife and I will be back, hopefully with the live Jazz playing."}
{"text":"Very cool and chic bar upstairs.  Contemporary.  Live Jazz in the evening, that wasn't obnoxious, nor loud.  Service was excellent.  Waitress made every effort to seat six of us, without a reservation, at 7:00 pm, on a Saturday.  And she was pretty.  A little \"older\" crowd.  Our group age range was from 30-40 (ish), but many of the other diners were cool \"old\" people.  Slicked grey hair, well dressed, and not loud.  But, honestly, average age was about 65. Just sayin, a little \"mature.\"  Food was WONDERFULL. Eggplant bruschetta, seared ahi tuna bites, GIANT blue point oysters, wedge salad, and crab and shrimp stuffed mushrooms in a sauce that we had to fight over...WONDERFULL.  VERY VERY YUMMY.  Price: can't recall  Drinks:  full bar, stiff martinis.  Parking: stinks.  you must park in a garage and walk, or valet.  Not to far to walk, however.  A great alternative to Ocean Club, which is great, but this place has food with tons of Italian influenced flavor."}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner on a Tuesday.  I had a Groupon for a value of  $40.  I ordered and presented the voucher, and was shortly thereafter informed they would only honor it for $30. They claimed it was some sort of glitch by Groupon.   While their food, wine, & my service were outstanding - I was only one of 2 tables occupied in the entire restaurant.   What a stupid way to disenfranchise a guest, especially one who has dined there previously. As I live in the immediate area, I certainly enjoy helping an establishment by dining there through the lean summer months.  But that's just horrible business acumen.  Guess I'll go to some of the other restaurants in Kierland next time."}
{"text":"Start with a rude hostess who refused to seat my wife and I at a table As it was a 4 top and not more than a minute later the other hostess seated two people there.  No bread service though every other table  had bread . Entrees were served while I was clearly not half way through my salad.  Both  pasta entrees were less than Olive Garden quality. Draft beer not available (frozen lines?) Beer I ordered not available. I have never been to a restaurant that adds a automatic gratuity to the bill for a party of two, but they did here.  I guess with the problems they have with food and  service they feel no one would leave a descent tip. Lots of other Italian restaurants in Scottsdale - all are better than Bobby's."}
{"text":"Bobby's, the Mancuso Restaurant is no longer a Mancuso Restaurant. They sold the one at the summit, so it is now just Bobby's.  My first time in the restaurant was last night. We didn't even know where to find the place. It was an eventful night to say the least. We arrived and realized my buddy still had his gun on his hip so went back to the truck to put that in the glove box (can't carry in a place that serves alcohol. We got back to the truck I'd owned for one hour, and realized I'd locked myself out of it. Once the AAA guy came we were good to go.  Back into the restaurant, it was dead downstairs at 8:30 so we went up to the lounge where they had a live piano/vocalist that was very entertaining. Beautiful bar upstairs which is very dark in colors and lighting. Downstairs is all white, with a little more lighting, and would be a nice place to take a second or third date or celebrate a somewhat special occasion. The restaurant really feels like two places in one. A trendy, fun, bar atmosphere that can cater to the more sophisticated younger crowds or the older crowds. Then the dining room feels very upscale, chic, New York City trendy but not-too trendy.  Our dinner we both agreed was great. Started off with the calamari fritti (11) which came with a tomato wine sauce that I thought was less than stellar, but the calamari was delicious by itself thankfully. The other app we tried was the stuffed mushrooms (10) which came in a dish of 6. They were well stuffed with sausage, garlic, cheese, and covered with alfredo sauce. It was a great dish that we both enjoyed. We had Veal Oscar and Veal Saltimbocca (27/29) for our entrees. I tried both and really preferred my Saltimbocca which was wrapped in prosciutto with ricotta cheese and a great cream sauce. The Veal was not really tender, and seemed as though it had been cooked a little on the long side. I like my abused baby cow to be tender as it gets.   The service here is perfect to a T. The gentleman who was our waiter upstairs never missed a beat and all of our food came out very quickly. One thing that he did reveal to us is they offer one free refill on soft drinks, and then charge again. He didn't charge me for my 5 iced teas, but said normally they do. That is kind of cheap.  Dinner for two with no alcohol - $82 + tip - not too bad for a place like this. I'll definitely do it again."}
{"text":"When walking into Bobby's, I was initially excited.  The tmosphere looked very terendy and fun, however I quickly noticed that, including myelf, there were only 8 customers in the restaurant.  Not to fear, it was only a Tuesday I said, lets look at the menu.....  I ordered the steak, mushrooms app and the Escargot.  The mushrooms were watery like that of something old and out of the freezer. The steak was OK, definitely not worth the price and definitely not cooked to my order. Finally, the Escargot was absolute trash, no flavor, full of oil and again watery.  Overall, don't go to Bobby's.  Take your money elsewhere in the Kierland area."}
{"text":"I used to absolutely love Bobby's Restaurant and Jazz Lounge.  The first few times we ate there, the food was outstanding, the service was excellent, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  We also went to their Happy Hour upstairs in the lounge several times, where the menu during happy hour has a great selection of appetizers and they have special prices on drinks.     However, it seems lately that Bobby's is going downhill.  We've actually left a couple times recently because no one ever waited on us in the bar.  Tonight, it seemed like the staff were far more interested in talking to each other than seeing if their customers were enjoying their visit.  While I still think the food is very good, for the prices that you'll pay to eat at Bobby's, you can go to Morton's or the Capital Grill, where you'll get top notch service and feel like a valued customer, not someone who is taking the servers away from chatting with each other.  It's also been rather disappointing that at least 3 or 4 times recently, we've stopped by to have a drink and an appetizer only to find out that a private party had reserved the entire lounge.   I'm surprised they do that so regularly.   The lounge could also use an update.  It is starting to look like something out of an Austin Power's movie, with the groovy red lights and the bead curtains.  I think a fresher look would make it far more appealing.  We've opted lately to go elsewhere when we are in the mood for a really fine dinner, largely because of the rather indifferent service and if I'm going to pay around $150 for dinner for two people, I'd rather go somewhere that has a more appealing ambiance and a more welcoming attitude."}
{"text":"Bobby's has a pretty good steak sandwich on the lunch menu which is fairly small and priced like it was big. They also have a good stacked eggplant that is a good size for lunch.  I don't like going to this restaurant because they have jazz music that I didn't like playing and I don't like how it's decorated with jazz pictures. Also, most of their food is very over priced."}
{"text":"do not go here!! they ruined my 30th birthday party!!! it looks nice online and they make it seem so pristine over the phone, but the only thing good about this place is the decor. to start it off the waiter was rude and didn't bring us water until 15 minutes of sitting at our table of 10 people. we ordered the calamari for an appetizer and it was so gross we had to send it back. i ordered the shrimp cocktail and it tasted like it came from a frozen bag. i ordered a martini which took the waiter 30 min to bring, and i ordered another one before our food came out and i didn't get it until the middle of dinner. i ordered the lobster ravioli for dinner which i took one bite of and it was cold and absolutely unacceptable, i couldn't believe it. the waiter took it back to the kitchen and brought back another plate which was hot and cooked the 2nd time around. my friends chicken ravioli was watery and she hated it and had to send it back. i could tell my other friends at the table were not satisfied, they just didn't want to be rude. the waiter was unattentive and didn't care it was my birthday. he had to ask at the end of the party whos birthday it was again, so he could put my birthday cake in front of me. thank goodness we brought our own cake that we had made, because that was the only good thing there was to eat!!  i wanted to celetrate  with martinis all night but only ended up getting 2, because the service was horrific!!! i was so pissed when we left after paying our  awesome 700 dollar bill.  i would have been more satisfied with taco bell food. the reason why the waiter didn't pay attention to us is because he knew he was getting his already included 18 percent gratuity, which he did not deserve, he deserve 10 bucks if that!!   thank you bobby's for ruining my 30th birthday!!! i really appreciate it."}
{"text":"Love Bobby's Restaurant and Jazz Lounge. My wife, two kids and I eat there 2-3 times a month. The food is Excellent!!! We will keep going back to Bobby's."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was a little concerned about what to expect.... But was going with a large group (20) for someone's going away party. Service was exceptional, food was Great!!! Many of us did the 4 course for $32 and I did not hear a complaint from anyone!!!  Just before the entree's came, my better half left the table to head to the restroom. When the waiter noticed she was not there, he grabbed a cover for her food and when he saw her heading to the table, he ran back and took the cover off BEFORE she got to the table!!!  Does not get better than that!!  I had the shrimp scampi on the four course deal, and was Pleasantly surprised!!  Friday evening."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and it is, hands down, the best filet in town. I have been to every single great restaurant and steakhouse in Phoenix / Scottsdale, and I still maintain they have the best Medium Rare Filet in all of the city.  The service here is great, the drinks are wonderful, the live music is entertaining, and the food is superb. Bobby's is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  Try the Caesar salad, eggplant rollitini, butternut squash ravioli, tiramisu, it's all good!!"}
{"text":"Not the worst ever, but I never need to go back. If I pay this much for food, I expect an experience far better than what I had.  They told us at 6:45 they had seats for us. They didn't actually, but sent us upstairs to the lounge by the bar & unnecessarily loud music. An hour later, after we had already decided to just order upstairs, they asked if we wanted to sit downstairs. Note, this was one hour after they said they had seats. I understand being off by 10-15 mins, but 60 is far too much.  Our meal took really long to come out as well. Ultimately, our food came to us over 90 mins after the time we were told we'd be seated. Again, if I pay more for food, I expect the service to match. This was not my experience here."}
{"text":"Had a party of 26 to this establishment.  From the outside looking in this place looked great.  But as they say looks can be deceiving.   Beginning with the service, they definitely lacked it.  I don't know how many times I had to walk up to the waiter asking for another glass of wine to be filled or water.  Than came the food.  9 guests ordered the Shrimp and Scallops entree except they forgot to put on the scallops.  WHen mentioned the waiter apologized and brought out a plate of scallops and tossed 2 per individual.    We brought our own birthday cake and when it was carried to our table the edges had thumb prints on the sides, thus ruining a nice picture of a custom made cake.  When I asked how did this happen the manager, Ugly Betty- i called her, said it wasn't there fault and gave me attitude.  But the worst thing about this is they had the gall to charge us $52 to cut and serve our cake.  And this was after they ruined it.    The music and band was nice but we asked them to play the birthday song once the cake was brought out.  Instead they played the birthday song 10 mins before the cake was brought out and all of us were confused why are we singing the Bday song and cake is not out.    As the party began to unwind a group of us were standing and talking near the table when the clean up crew comes up and tells us to remove all of our belongings from the table.  I was disgusted that here we are still trying to enjoy ourselves and their basically throwing us out.   To say the least I will never patron this place again.  Our friends and family were in shock as well.    BUYER BEWARE!!!"}
{"text":"I am a very picky person and at times hard to please but I love Bobby's Resaurant. The prices are great and the atmosphere is very laid back. I've only gone on Fridays and Saturdays after 5:00 pm, so I'm unsure of how their service is in the daytime. Yes, there have been times when we've walked in and the hostess isn't at the front, but we just walk on upstairs and seat ourselves for happy hour. Maybe we've had good luck with this place but I've gone to Bobby's at least half a dozen times..and I have no compliants."}
{"text":"Ok, based on my first experience at Bobby's, I was not overly enthusiastic to come back.  However, last weekend some friends and I decided to hit it up for happy hour, and I will admit that this visit was decidedly better than the first one.  In fact, if I were rating on this visit alone, I'd be giving it a 4 star review.  However with the previous memory in mind, I'll meet in the middle and call it a solid 3.  Our server was charming and was right on top of our orders, appearing just when the drinks were low enough to order more.  She even stopped by right before the happy hour cutoff to make sure we didn't need anything else before the prices jumped.  The live music was good, if not a little loud.  The food was pretty good, although nothing overly exciting to write about.  I had the mozzarella and marinara (which I thought would be in the form of mozarella sticks) but was in fact a large square of breaded mozarella that needed to be cut into bite sized pieces, and was a little too light on the marinara topping in my opinion.  Overall, the experience was much more pleasant, the service excellent, and the food tasty, and the drinks delicious (I am a FAN of their dirty martini).  I'll definitely come back again and see if we can't boost it up another notch after #3."}
{"text":"I went to Bobby's Restaurant and Jazz Lounge with my girlfriend for our anniversary. We sat upstairs where Jazz was playing, and from the minute we sat down we had an absolutely splendid time. After a few drinks, we proceeded to order our entrees.  I had the Chicken Ravioli, and the sauce that was on top of it was to die for. I crave it so often, but I never have the time to go back to Bobby's because of the distance away from my house.   I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a relaxing and romantic night out."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour...unbelievable selection, great atmosphere, gracious service. I can't believe it has taken me this long to discover the wonderful food that Bobby's has. I am also very surprised at the low ratings that the restaurant has received on this site. Fran Mancuso, the owner was so warm, friendly and welcoming!  The service was top notch and did not miss a beat. The ambiance in the lounge was upbeat and lively. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After living in Scottsdale for a few years and being a total foodie, my boyfriend and I finally decided to check out Bobby's. In short, I give it 1 star for it's stylish decor and 1 star for our friendly waiter, Adam.  The inside of the restaurant has a very modern, chic ambiance; we sat upstairs in the jazz bar area. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, all was going well. Our waiter brought out the bread and it was tasteless.. it's like they cooked up a dry pizza bread and sprinkled some orange cheese on top.  On to the ordering.. we ordered a bottle of wine and the oysters rockefeller to start followed by my medium-rare filet mignon oscar style and his paella plate. The oysters were covered in spinach and a pile of cheese. You could barely taste the little oyster with all that cheese they put on it. We tried to shrug off their oyster rockefeller dish and think optimistically, as the restaurant was so pretty and their menu had a great selection of dishes... we really wanted to like this place.  My filet came out a little more medium than medium-rare but that wasn't the bad part. What was this oscar style attempt?! It was as if they cooked a tasteless piece of meat and then put a little canned crab on top, a little sauce, a slice of cheese and then melted it, as if that would pull it together. You could tell that these tastes were not cooked or meshed together in any way, just thrown together. I could have done better in my own kitchen. As for my boyfriend's paella, the rice was small and nothing special or authentic about it. There were some little clams, shrimp, etc, but it was just \"meh.\" He and I both didn't like our dishes and vice versa.  Needless to say, we did not order dessert. I really don't know how much longer Bobby's can compete in that area with such GREAT restaurants around it - Mastros Ocean Club, Dominicks, Eddie V's."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a nice evening of live music and great food, both were a bit of a let down unfortunately. The food was pretty average, better than Outback but no better than Longhorns. We were seated away from the live music so it was basically like listening to musak while eating our dinner. Not sure why, didn't seem that crowded when we arrived. Our server was very nice and helpful, but at the end of the meal you just feel a bit of a let down. Then when you get the bill, you really wish you had gone to either Outback or Longhorns because you would enjoyed it just as much but would've saved yourself over $75.00. I couldn't justify ever going back for a second time. You live and you learn."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to take a chance on this place and I am glad we did!  The decor of the place reminded me of Vegas. They also had some very nice Jazz playing.  Once we walked in we were greeted and escorted to the upstairs level where we were seated.The upstairs was pretty empty there was only about 10 to 15 other people having dinner.   Our waiter was Kelsey, who was very friendly and gave us some good reccomendations. We ordered the calamari and Seafood Paella. While we waited for our food she brought us some bread, which was very tasty. It was a combination of garlic and cheese toast. We finished the basket they brought to our table, but Kelsey brought us another when our Paella arrived.   The calamari was good, it wasn't to greasy or under cooked. They served it with some pico de gallo on the side which was a nice complement to the calamari. The seafood paella was scrumptious! It had a great proportion of sausage, seafood, veggies, rice and broth. The rice wasn't too dry or too wet.   The seafood paella is perfect to split between two people. I am glad we came here and tried the food instead of listening to the bad reviews."}
{"text":"Jazz Lounge. Nuff said. Glass a vino and some Mingus-esque vibes baby it's a winner. Not sure about the food but if you're going to a jazz lounge, food is an afterthought. Vino, Cabernet, Merlot? They all go good with Jazz. There's no room for whiners in a house of jazz."}
{"text":"Can I give it 3.5 stars? Okay, I'm givin' it 4! I've been to Bobby's twice now and been really pleased with both the food and the ambiance. We've had very attentive service as well. But I've decided the kicker is to take advantage of specials.   For example, the first time I went was for AZ Restaurant Week where I was able to try a prix fixe menu for a reasonable price. Last night I had my best friend from Kindergarten visiting who is a food disector... she literally takes food apart and re-distributes everything before taking the most finicky little bites. So I knew I needed a menu that was good, but had lots of variety with few surprises. I digress; we were ALL over that happy hour. Here's the thing, you get half-priced apps from 4-7pm along with the drinks specials. Since we needed to sit for a while and catch up,  we got a couple glasses of wine and dug in.   The rundown:  Crab Cake and lobster ravioli - And I quote \"as if crab cake and lobster ravioli on the same plate isn't good enough, they go the extra mile and top it with delicate lil shrimpies!\" (she got a second order later)  Eggplant rolletin - the thinnest, most tender eggplant, rolled up like a lil taquito with ricotta inside. (again, cause for a second order)  Escargot burgougne - I figured my first exposure to escargot might as well have them stuffed in beloved mushrooms. I could give or take this one, it was chewy and burned my tongue... but the garlic/wine/butter-oil they were swimming in went great with the bread.  Butternut squash raviolis - The stars of the evening, in my opinion... light, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. They have a hint of what I think I identified as clove or possibly nutmeg inside and are topped with a few diced tomatoes in a light, buttery sauce with a bit of sage. If I could ask for anything, it would be to have ordered a wine that paired better with them... love those lil guys!  Dessert - Not on happy hour, but we needed stretch out the stay. Cheesecake was generously portioned (too big, really) but good. I had the dessert special that I can't remember the name of, but it was ice cream over strawberries, topped with an Italian custard... very tasty!  It came to about $40 for each of us, but we stayed for hours and ate more than any normal human beings because that's what we do together... 6 dishes, desserts, and 4 glasses of wine for $80 isn't bad at all. While I love the food, the place always seems pretty empty, and the normal prices are just a bit steep... again, I want to give it 3.5 stars, but ya'll must try the squash!!!"}
{"text":"A wonderful dinner spot. Very special food (calamri was great as was halibut) served by an attentive staff in a warm environment!"}
{"text":"Awesome food ........Great Ambiance.....only downside is that in 4 visits my order was once incorrect and another time partially not submitted....."}
{"text":"I wanted to enjoy this place but I could not.  The manager is very rude. She would not try to accommodate a large party that wanted to come in and spend money and enjoy jazz.  The music wasn't that special but it was good and easy to listen too.  The Bar service is expensive and they don't even have good selections or choices."}
{"text":"My wife and I walked by this restaurant while shopping and made a point to come back for dinner. What's not to like: Italian Jazz Club with a great wine list?  We brought a friend with us on a Saturday Night and were seated promptly downstairs inside, but by the open patio seating. Weather was fine, so no problem. The problem was that there was apparently a wedding reception going on upstairs in the jazz lounge. the music and noise from that reception were loud, screechy and definitely not entertaining. In fact, the music and noise were so irritating, that we almost left before ordering. The food was OK although the portions were large and my wife's veal was not seasoned well and more rare than medium rare. The wine list was reasonable although a bit overpriced. We didn't stay for dessert. Overall, it seems like it would be a better experience if they actually had a jazz combo playing like advertised. In the future, if they are hosting a private event, they should let the regular customers know. And they should NEVER have a wedding reception on a Saturday night and still keep the restaurant open for other diners. Not cool!"}
{"text":"Only been once but feel unsure - hence the two stars. Really I'd like to slice it down the middle and do 2.5 but oh well.  The veggie lasagna & linguine with white clam sauce that we had was pretty on point. Dare I say divine. The service was also pretty freaking excellent. But the thing is... How u say... Ok I'll just say it. AMBIANCE WAS A BUMMER, sincerely! like the gaudy type of decor brought a stuffiness to the experience. Also the bizarre eighties elevator music was pretty loud and depressing at the same time. Truly id give this place a 4-5 star had it not been for the lack of atmosphere. Such a depressing setting. Too bad cause the food, pricing and service was A-ok!!! This restaurant is confused. Doesn't know if it wants to be chill, hip & cool OR upscale class act. It's neither...  It even confused me & the hubby. Sorry. Just keeping it real :)"}
{"text":"Very pretty place, and charming bartender Pi didn't mind me calling him Whispers.  The live music was nice."}
{"text":"\"What's a Mancuso?\" said Susy C to her friend. \"I dunno\" he replied, \"but let's go eat there so you can just say you did\" \"Oh yeah sure, i'll just be like 'psh, hello guys, I had Mancuso's.\"  Think Austin Powers meets a hodge podge of Asian, Italian and American restaurants.  On my last day in Scottsdale, my pal and I happened across this restaurant whilst strolling along in Kierland. Okay I lie, and why the hell am I trying to talk all fancy? Being in Scottsdale is getting to my head! I was famished, dare I say starving and ready to chew my own arm off?  Anyway, it was sunday, the restaurant was practically empty.  Service was fair although they did forget our napkins. Food was decent, moderately priced.  We split the calamari appetizer. My friend doesn't eat the little tentacles so I got to devour them myself, YES! I had the Ahi Tuna Salad while my friend had a small house salad which is a HUGE plate of salad for $5. I mean seriously, I could've been satisfied off that thing! Okay i'm lying again, I eat a lot and it wouldn't have filled me up. My friend also had the linguini with clams in white sauce. It smelled good, but I don't think it was that great.  At the end of our meal I half expected Mike Meyers to walk down the stairs and exclaim \"yeaa baby yeaaa! Do I make you rrrrrrrrrrandy?\""}
