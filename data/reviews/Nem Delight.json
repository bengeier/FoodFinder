{"text":"This is my ultimate favourite places for Vietnamese food in the city. They do AMAZING imperial rolls, and their noodles & grilled pork bowl is simply divine. I would definitely recommend phoning in advance to order your food to avoid the long wait times, but the food is worth it. Just avoid their bubble tea, it's not excellent."}
{"text":"Tried a couple different soup, bun, and subs with the same results: always greasy and lacking flavour. I'm generally a big fan of spring rolls made with rice paper, but these are flacid and bland. Soup looks good, with lots of shiny oil and green onions on top, but the broth is weak. Nothing is \"bad\" per-se, just bland enough to make you wish you were eating some fresher, tastier Vietnamese. Not sure why I've given them as many tries as I have?"}
{"text":"So, tonight I called in advance - especially after reading about everyone's long wait times. I ordered one batch of spring roll, two batches of shrimp salad rolls, and two bubble teas. The man on the phone told me twenty minutes. Twenty minutes later we show up to pick up our food. It hasn't even been started. I'm all for fresh food, but we ended up waiting an additional 20 minutes for our order to be ready :(  I have come here just for bubble tea before - if you plan to do this make sure you have at least 15minutes to wait for it.   On the up side, I have always found the food to be really good. I also really like that their bubble teas are actually fruit smoothies"}
{"text":"This place used to be a take out chinese restaurant that closed more than a year ago. I've visited two times and ordered a vietnamese bun and sub. Both times I've had to had quite a while to get the food made. The wait time makes no sense for take out, the food gets cold by the time you get home and with any take out/delivery, the food isn't as good arriving at your house as when it leaves the kitchen the fundamental rule of any take out is that the quality degrades.  Also I don't know what to quite make of the menu, they're enlarged 20X to make sure that even Hans Mole http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moleman could read.  Prices were fair and the service was friendly. Personally I would make the extra drive to the other Vietnamese restaurants in the area for a chance to sit down and enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"Ok. so I ordered here again for take out. This time their 'specials'.... was ok... soooo much rice with not enough pork... :(    Still the closest take out Vietnamese to me..."}
{"text":"I have been to several Vietnamese restaurants in SE Calgary, this one is by far the best.   Nems is a takeout only restaurant. It is fairly consistent on the quality of food you get. I love the calamari, it is one of my favourite dishes. Everything is quite fresh and tasty. Prices are pretty decent as well. I would agree that some of the fried noodle and rice dishes are a little bland but still fairly good if you kick it up with some sauce. Overall, if you're looking for some good takeout Nems is a great way to go."}
