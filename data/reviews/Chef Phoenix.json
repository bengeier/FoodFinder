{"text":"Great service for any budget! 
Rob and his team created a fabulous feast for our daughter's wedding; we had 120 guests and he helped us by offering delicious options that both looked wonderful , and fit within our budget. 
Our guests enjoyed appetizers followed by a plentiful buffet of pastas with several sauces, chicken , steamed veggies, etc.
Whether you want exotic or basic , Chef Phoenix is your ticket!"}
{"text":"Chef Phoenix catered my dad's 70th birthday party. He was prompt, set up quickly, and brought everything needed. The food was fantastic. He uses fresh and organic ingredients. The Bolognese sauce was made with certified Angus beef and the chicken Parmesan was made with free range chicken. We had bruschetta, steamed vegetables, angel hair pasta, risotto, a delicious Alfredo sauce, garlic bread and salads. There were about 50 guests and we had plenty of food and more! I would highly recommend Chef Phoenix."}
{"text":"I met Robert (chef) and team at the Farmers Market in Agritopia. Robert had a booth and I purchased a few of the meals to try it out. The meals were delicious! Fast forward a few months...I just hosted a baby shower and decided to cater. I remember Chef Phoenix and chatted with them about the menu, budget, headcount, etc. Chef Phoenix was so easy to work with. My guest-of-honor wanted something paleo, not to sweet, and a salad. Chef Phoenix knew exactly what to do.

The menu we decided was simple: Market Hash, Farm Fresh eggs, Summer Salad, Pumpkin choco chip and Lemon Blueberry poppy seed muffins, and Strawberry Shortcake for dessert. OMG, the food was absolutely amazing!! All the guests raved about the brunch and asked how I met Chef Phoenix. The food tasted \"clean\" and fresh (he uses fresh ingredients). Our mouths were in heaven!!

If you're looking for a caterer to help with your next event, I highly recommend Chef Phoenix. Not only was the food delicious but Robert was so easy to work with! He was accommodating to our fluctuating headcount, communicated thoroughly via email, delivered and set up the day of the event. Chef Phoenix is my go to caterer. I'm currently thinking of another event to host just so I can use them again! =)"}
