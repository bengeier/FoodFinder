{"text":"Decided to try a different pho restaurant after getting somewhat tired of the same old (Pho Hoang in The Junction). This is a tiny restaurant in a strip mall off St. Clair near Runnymede. I ordered delicious and crispy spring rolls (thumbs up), shrimp fresh rolls (mediocre), and a Pho Tai. Tasty soup and really soft and fresh rice noodles but the stingiest serving of rare beef I've ever had (2 small slices). Maybe their vermicelli or rice (cóm) dishes are better?"}
{"text":"This is a great neighbourhood place. Small, but popular. Great food. Quick service and fair prices."}
{"text":"I went with a friend this evening for dinner.  The waiters had excellent customer service. The food was very good I got beef stir fry and fresh shrimp rolls.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Bun mang vit is really good here! My friends had the bun cha Hanoi and said it's the best one they had in Toronto so far! Will be back to try the other dishes soon"}
{"text":"I need to start off by explaining my review might be a little biased as I know the owners. I used to get the food for free when I visited their house but it's sooo good that I am totally willing to pay for the food. At least now, I can eat it whenever I want! I highly recommend trying this place. Even though Vietnam is a small country, food is very different from each province/region. This restaurant offers the northern flavors from Hanoi unlike most of Toronto's Vietnamese restaurants which offer southern flavors. 

The MUST try = bun cha ha noi which translates to vermicelli with grilled pork. There's a bowl of grilled pork and pork sausage (made in house) in a bowl of milder tasting traditional nuoc cham (mixed fish sauce) served with a side of herbs, pickled daikons and carrots, and lettuce with a pile of vermicelli. You are supposed to add the vermicelli to the bowl of meat and sauce and dig in. 

Items that I swear by:
Pad thai with chicken
Bun mang vit (duck and bamboo noodle soup)
Mango salad 
Spring rolls (both vegetarian and pork versions - yeah you read right...they serve Viet style vegetarian spring rolls)
Tiet canh vit (you need to order ahead of time and I will not bother translating this as you should not eat this if you don't already know what it is  :-P)
Chao long doi - best long doi in the GTA

The prices are $1-2 higher than other places. The home-made cooking style and generous portions are worth more than the price difference to me.  Try them out and see for yourself.  It's like mom or grandma's cooking."}
{"text":"I tried first time Vietnamese food and I have to say it was delicious. For appetizer we had shrimp summer rolls and I think they are so fast the best summer rolls I ever had in my life. 
The sauce on the side was perfect to eat the summer rolls. Then we had the duck salad the salad was amazing but sadly the duck was not cooked well. 
And as the main course I had the chicken vermicelli bowl it came with a spring roll and this was the hidden gem such a great combination of flavors.
And at the end I had very delicious Vietnamese coffee. After drinking that I know the real meaning of coffee.
I would definitely recommend this place.
And I will go again 
It's family friendly and even great for dinner and lunch with colleges and friends.
Price was is nice too."}
{"text":"Ooooh I enjoyed my dinner here so much. I was craving Vietnamese since I arrived to Toronto and this small place -and all the good reviews I read- did not disappoint me!

My boyfriend ordered a Pho with pork and I ordered the lemongrass chicken with vegetables and rice. Everything was so fresh, full of intense flavours and super tasty, even the small spring onion soup that came with my main dish was great and full of flavour. 

We finished our dinner full and super satisfied, and at a very good price. Totally recommendable."}
{"text":"Very very good Vietnamese food. I love the spring rolls and their bun. All their appetizers are so tasty. Always fresh and well served."}
{"text":"Best Toronto restaurant Hidden secret! Restaurant is a small family own, in a small plaza on St.Clair. Specialize in Vietnamese Hanoi dishes plus your every day pho in Northern style. When you ordered chicken pho and they have the chicken cut the way you do at home, you knows its authentic!  If you want to step out of the box, they are know for their chao long and long roi, serve only on the weekend. Their bun cha Hanoi is to die for, and all their appetizers are amazing. Recommend not to go in big group cause the wait would be forever, but going with a party of 4 and under there's still a wait. I noticed that after 3:30pm it's slow down a bit, but that's means your Long Roi might be sold out.  Sometimes a wait meant the place is worth your times in my opinion. I rather wait for something good, versus paying for something mediocre lol."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Pho soup. it was the best chicken pho I remember having. it was very rich and filling, and they use real chicken soup base unlike some other restaurants...
this place is value for the money!"}
{"text":"Authentic Northern-style Vietnamese food that hard to find where else."}
{"text":"Good, no-frills restaurant that doesn't get the attention it deserves. The decor is non-existent,and the service a matter of fact, but the food is excellent. There's a nice selection of Northern style dishes here, like Bun Cha Hanoi, and basics like pho and bun. But the thing that stands out is the pork intestines and sausages that you can't find in many other restaurants. They're probably the main reason you'll find Vietnamese farm workers there eating late into the night. Servings are large too, so you'll only need a small pho to be full."}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian spring roll with vermicelli. It was mediocre. I heard raving reviews and suggestions from my Vietnamese friends about the $12 bowl of pho and offals congee but I don't eat pho or internal organs of an animal so it didn't make sense for me to be here. My friend didn't enjoy the beef pho as it was very oily and not properly drained out. I had a painful stomach ache after my meal. Sorry but I won't be coming back here again and this star rating is based on both myself and my friend's experience."}
{"text":"I went with my family a few days ago. There are a few pho restaurants in this mini plaza. My parents always prefer Pho Son for their pho over the other restaurants. I ordered the Bun Cha Hanoi and thought it was delicious. The fish sauce was just right and the pickled vegetables were done nicely.  We ordered fried noodles with chicken as well as Pho Dac Biet and everything was delicious and flavorful. Seating is limited here but overall the restaurant was clean and the food was good. I will definitely be back as I thought everything I tried was good!"}
{"text":"Love love this place!  My friend highly recommended that I go here so I did and omg my first sip was amazing!  The broth tasted extremely authentic and reminds me of Vietnam.  They use fresh thick noodles but I prefer the thin ones.  The beef is also weak since its not Alberta beef but the broth really won me over.  It has a lot of flavor without the heavy msg taste.  We also ordered the rare beef dish and it was pretty good as well. 
I could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and the it wasn't bad! I've heard so many good things about Pho Son, especially their Long Doi dish. And I have to admit, they have the best lòng di dish in GTA!!!

Pho Son is a small restaurant on St Clair near Runnymede. It's very tiny but clean. The staffs are quick. The seats are limited so you may have to wait during their rush hours. 

Besides lòng di, I ordered Bun Cha Ha Noi or Northern style grilled pork with vermicelli. The meat was a bit hard and dry, their vermicelli as well. But the fish sauce was just right that kinda help me to be able to almost finish the dish.  It comes with herbs, pickled daikons and carrots, and lettuce. It was a good dish, but I won't say it's the best Bun Cha in GTA.

Some may not like it since they make the broth for Pho differently. Why? Because they made it the Northern style. The broth is clearer, but has stronger taste and more flavourful. 

The food portion is pretty decent for the price you have to pay. I will definitely come back here to try out other items on their menu. And once I did, I will write an update.

Till the next check-in...:p"}
{"text":"I went with my boyfriend for lunch yesterday. We ordered the beef singapore stir fried noodle, beef noodle soup, spring roll and fresh shrimp roll. 

Honesty the one dish i was okay with was the fresh shrimp roll. The Singapore noodle was too greasy, each bite was just a mouth full of oil, it over powered the dish. 

The beef noodle was the most disappointing dish we got, we were not able to eat after the second bite. When I got the beef noodle soup, I noticed a heavy soap like scent coming from the bowl and the over cooked two little pieces of meat. I thought maybe they were too heavy handed with the seasoning and I'm just being crazy, I took the first bite and all i taste was lavender soap. I had my boyfriend tried the soup and he tasted the soap too. 

The spring roll has barely any meat in it, it was all just taro, which made the spring roll very mushy and not pleasant to eat. 

I have been to Hanoi and there food is amazing but this restaurant was just a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I never give 5 stars for a Vietnamese restaurant because they always lack something. But this restaurant is just good in general. 

We drove all the way to the restaurant for 30 minutes because we heard they serve authentic and well-known Northern Vietnamese cuisines. 

Instead of getting Pho today, we ordered the special Vietnamese grilled sausages, Ha Noi styled vemicelli, and Marinated Pockhoc with Vemicelli. 

The grilled sausages were the best thing I've ever had at a Vietnamese restaurants. They were absolutely delicious. It is my favorite dish there and I think I will always come back for this. 

The Hanoi styled vemicelli was also very good. It was very tasty when I had my first bites, but then the grilled sausages came out and I was just so into the sausages after. 

My friend ordered the Marinated Pock Hoc and I tried one bite and honestly didn't like it much. My friend however said he likes it as much as I like my Hanoi vemicelli. 

Service, in general, is good too. The waiter was very nice. The only thing I noticed that the table was quite sticky so I hope it could be wiped carefully next time. 

The restaurant is very small. There are about 6-8 tables. It will be hard to get enough seats if you come with a group. I noticed a family group of 5 and 6 came in and were not able to get enough seats. 

Pricing is fair I would say. It is for sure on a higher-priced side compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. However this restaurant is very unique in terms of dishes they servered. It's quite impossible to find another Viet restaurant that serve authentic Northern dishes such as grilled sausages, or marinated pock hoc. 

Overall I totally recomend this restaurant if you want to try authentic northern cuisine. It was my first time trying it today and I was completely satisfied with my meal.

P/s: Vietnamese grilled sausage is only available from Fri to Sun as it is a part of the Weekends Special."}
