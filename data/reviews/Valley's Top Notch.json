{"text":"The pizza and panzerotti here are great. Even when you go in and get a slice from the warming tray, it is good. I can't comment on their delivery, as I have always just walked in.  The only issue I have with them is that they don't seem to have any posted hours, and apparently they're not open for lunch?"}
{"text":"Nothing here is \"top notch\". Everything is mediocre at best.  Panzerotto was soggy, pasta and meatballs tasted funny. Pizzas were just ok, definitely not gourmet.  Next time I'll go to Quattro 4 ragazze or Pizza Nova."}
{"text":"I have lived down the street from this pizza place for a number of years and never thought to try it. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the toppings, the texture of the crust - I am picky when it comes to pizza. The service was also fast and friendly. I ordered a veggie pizza with mushroom, green peppers and olives and picked it up from the store with no wait.They have a whole wheat/multigrain crust option which is a kicker for me! I will be returning for my next pizza order for sure."}
{"text":"Tried to find a local company but after waiting 1 1/2 hours for delivery not sure it is worth it. The pizza was good but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Barely edible. Spend $60 on delivery for 2 pizzas and wings and it was less than average. The pizza was undercooked, there was no sauce, the toppings were second-rate and I will definitely never order from again. Surprised about all the positive reviews, pizza is a rare things to make such mistakes on."}
{"text":"Walked by today and the inside is demolished and there is a notice on the door that the store has been closed for non-payment of rent.  This has been our go-to pizza place for many years, Will have to find somewhere else."}
{"text":"I had  the pepperoni pizza and some wings, the wings are good, but not remarkable (it is a pizza place after all). The pepperoni pizza is very good as well, it doesn't taste cheap, it has a good sauce and texture. it stays together well and is an all around good pizza."}
