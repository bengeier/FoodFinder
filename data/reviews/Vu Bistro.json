{"text":"Don't bother!  The view is the only thing they have! What a joke! Nobody in the bar! Could it be because of the smelly mop bucket by the front door?"}
{"text":"Visited Vu for lunch. 
My first impression was a salon and restaurant? I will be open to the concept.

The place is dumpy, dirty, staff was RUDE.
Walked to kitchen because I could hear voices asked if they were open.
 It was a valid question as there was cut up, squeezed grapefruit on the bar, beside the grocery store bag its friends were in. 

Stuff scattered about inside, used cleaning rags etc. 
Waited for 22 minutes for iced water. A hairdresser delivered  water!
There were only two other folks I the whole place!
 I was to meet a friend here, I called and said, there is no way I will eat here! 
No umbrellas for outside, watering hoses strewn about. 

The manager came out, a very disheveled woman, the one who tossed a chair pad across the table, asked what was wrong. I politely said it's been 22 minutes for water. Her response, \"I thought you were waiting for someone.\" Then I said is the place usually this unkempt, hoses, used food on bar counter, no one to seat folks, etc. I said all this in a very low voice so that the 2 other guests would not hear me. \"what do you want, we are this way.\" 
The view is nice, the \"bistro\" not so much? The manager was horrid.
I don't know how a business in such a competitive market can be so casual about customer service.
Stay far far away"}
{"text":"First visit to Fountain Hills and we stopped for late afternoon dinner, recommended by a friend.  Had  burgers and salads. Delicious!  Plenty of food and fair prices. Great location. View is beautiful.  Peaceful and friendly atmosphere.  Will return."}
{"text":"what is the deal with this place? went to lunch w my girlfriend.  I've had coffee there before, and the view is amazing.  We were the only people in the restaurant.  The food took 40 minutes.  There was no introduction. The waitress came up and said...are you ready to order.  My burger, which was actually OK, meaning I ate it bc I was so hungry, had coagulated cheese draining off the burger, and the fries were limp.  The food had to be sitting in the window for at least 15 minutes.  My girlfriend had a chicken salad.  Half the chicken was hot, the other half was cold.  She didn't touch it.  We didn't complain, just paid the bill and left.  Mostly because....how weird is this place.  How do you screw it up?  I've worked in restaurants- I get it- if there is no clientele, the kitchen takes it easy, etc.  But the waitress/staff didn't even pretend...I mean, lie to me! Pretend!  This place easily has one of the best locations in the Valley.  Bar none.  My 3 yr old could probably run this place better.  And his favorite food is apple sauce, goldfish, and strawberrys.  Deliver it, don't let it die in the window, refill my water, after ive obviously been hiking all morning, and let me enjoy the view.  Way to shoot yourself in the foot."}
{"text":"Went back to this lovely place for dinner when the weather is still nice ... 
And it's such a different vibe at nice ... this place is serene during the day but very lively at night with live music ... they have someone singing there and he was entertaining .... food is pretty good as well

But I would say the selling point of this place is the view you get especially at night, you can see the city light from there. Great place to sit back, relax and enjoy the night ..."}
{"text":"If i could give this place a negative I would.  I ordered the chicken and dumplings soup.  Like a fool I ate the entire thing.  I'm home in bed with vomiting,  diarrhea, and fever from food poisoning.   Stay clear..."}
{"text":"most amazing view in the valley.. a Hidden Gem in the Valley of the Sun... the food is always so delicious freshly prepared beautiful presentation... Lived spending Christmas  here and always..!!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on a Monday.  Only one server (which after reading others reviews I think was the owner) who was also the bartender and hostess apparently.  Took forever to get greeted and get some water, then took forever plus 20 minutes to get her to take our food order.  Menu is weird.  Looks like a fourth grader typed it up and the content makes no sense.  However, the food was excellent and fast.  Well presented and tasty. 
One of those rare incidences where good food made up for poor service.  Kudos to the chef (whom I hear is new and well accomplished).  We never saw the server/owner after our food came out.  Some guy came by and asked if we were ready to pay our bill and we did and left.  The place could be nice with the views and the new chef...
But the owner needs to hire some restaurant people to run her dining room to and let professionals try to save her business.  No uniforms and less than professional attitudes, a little dirty too.  We live in the area and hope they turn it around but looking at other reviews they aren't interested in building their business.  Sad really."}
{"text":"This place could have been, and should be, a goldmine!  View is just amazing, the entertainment on the patio was great..........but the service!  (Which there was none of)  Arrived Saturday evening 7:15, patio full.  (They only take reservations for parties over 6)  Took 15 minutes to be seated inside.  Once seated took another 10 min. to get water (Where I asked for brushetta (hungry)  and another 10 to order a glass of wine.  We were not \"allowed\" to order food because the kitchen was backed up!  Wasn't sure I understood that we were not to even get bread to hold us for a while!
An hour & 15 min. into this and i went to the manager who didn't seem to care - the kitchen was backed up and it would be another half hour for food!  ARE YOU KIDDING???

As I said, beautiful location.  Don't think I would ever attempt again!"}
{"text":"Been here dozen times. Food is amazing. Recommend filet quesadilla as I get it everytime. The flatbreads are also very good. The view is what most people come for. The one downside is service which you will see people complain about on here. Not bad on calm nights but weekends you can tell they dont have enough staff. I believe if they advertised to scottsdale and got more steady flow of people they would hire more people, but in mean time service will be iffy."}
{"text":"I've been going the the Vu for the last year. It's a great location with a beautiful panoramic view of the valley. The food is terrific! I love their Bruschetta!  Always a nice place to drop by, relax, take in the views, live music & delicious food. If you're in a hurry, go somewhere else, this is definitely a place to linger & re-charge your batteries."}
{"text":"Come here for the view and for nothing else.
The service isn't good and neither is the food.

The waiters didn't know a damn thing about the menu or what ingredients were used. When we ordered the charcuterie platter the man who delivered it pointed to the meats and cheese and touched each item with his finger. GROSS!

I also find it very odd that the restaurant is part of a salon and store that sells crap. 
Pick one thing and excel at it instead of trying to run 3 separate businesses to get the most of out of your lease. Clearly your restaurant is suffering as a result."}
{"text":"What a delight!  This was my first time at Vu Bistro this evening and it certainly won't be my last.  To start it off I mentioned to the hostess that I had read that the restaurant had many gluten free offerings and since I had celiac disease I was anxious to dine here.  My daughter and I were escorted out to a patio table with a spectacular view of the valley.  We peeked inside and saw a charming dining room and a very sleek and inviting bar area.  Our server was Randall and he was not only personable, but very attentive and provided wonderful service.  The chef Josh came to our table and explained the menu to us.  He shops locally and the food is fresh, organic and he purchases produce from local growers.  My salad was full of flavor with an assortment of greens, dates, walnuts, goat cheese, fennel, bacon and a brandy vinagrette.  My daughter had a Bosc pear soup with ginger, blue cheese and walnuts, it was fantastic.  My entree was scallops perfectly prepared accompanied by yukon mashed potatoes with granny smith apples, melted in my mouth, again, full of flavor.  We both had a coconut panna cotta with chocolate, cashews and toasted coconut, it was heaven.  My hats off to this new chef, Josh, he creates masterful dishes and an incredibly diverse menu, he has been a professional chef for 13 years and is new to Vu Bistro  If you want an absolutely unique dining experience in the valley, please put Vu Bistro on your list.  Everyone went out of their way to make this a perfect dining experience for us."}
{"text":"Beautiful view. This our second try with this restaurant.  The first time the service was terrible. Now I am back. I arrived a young man. I am still waiting for my food and my social security check."}
{"text":"Drove past this place 100s of times and never stopped. Glad I did, menu not a \"spa\" only menu, but a nice array of choices. I had a cheeseburger and fries and it was really good! Servers were very nice, but did feel like they were not quite ready to be open for business at 1 PM on a Sunday. Will go back and try other things."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time at the vu. The first time was okay-good food and service but nothing to rave about. This time, the food was still delicious but the manager, Heidi, who was also supposed to be our server, we only saw twice in the 2 hours we were there. On the other hand, the busser, Keaton, was promptly attentive the entire evening, while also serving the other 5 tables that were occupied. He stayed on top of everyone and everything: filling our waters (and making sure they were cold, since we were on the patio in 90 degree weather), taking empty plates/drinks, taking drink and food orders, serving food and drinks, and doing this for every other table as well. Throughout the evening, I even saw him provide extra cushions for an elderly couple and help them walk out to their car. Not to mention he was running the entire time. Needless to say, we tipped him heavily. I would return to the vu for his service and the food, but if I returned to just Heidi, I would not stay. I was completely disgusted with her lack of integrity and professionalism."}
{"text":"I'd like to thank Tony at VU who, upon entering the restaurant, greeted us with a smile and showed us to our table.  The view was breathtaking.  The service was on point and his appetizer recommendations were wonderful.  VU is a neighborhood gem.  I look forward to the cooler months when the fire pits are burning.  What a way to watch the sunset!  A wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I had a buger here a little while back that was really pretty good.  Good enough to go back.  They seem to have a good wine selection and it has, as the name would suggest, a fantastic VU!  I'm not sure, but I think it is connected to/owned by the same folks who own the salon next door.

The service was a little weak, but I think our waiter was a friend of the owner who was just helping out.  In fact, it kind made it seem like we were on someone's deck having dinner.  Someone with a really big deck with a great view.

It would be a great place to take a date and sit outside."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend.  There were only people seated at 2 tables.  We sat down and a nice young woman came over for our drink orders right away.  Then we waited.  And waited.  It looked like there was only 1 waitress.  She went past our table and said she'd be with us shortly before disappearing into a back room.  When she came back out, she walked right past our table to a table where people had already been served.  It looked like she was just standing there chatting with them.  
By now it was around 1pm and I started feeling a bit shaky.  I could not get the waitresses' attention so I got up and went over to her and told her I really needed to get some food immediately as I wasn't feeling well, adding. whatever the fastest thing would be.  She said 'how about soup'.  I said sure and went and sat down.  At least 5 minutes passed and no one came to our table.  Finally, the waitress came over...to take our order.  I asked about the soup.   said - I put it in. (I assumed she meant the order) I told her once again that I needed something, anything right now and she said I'll be right back with the soup.  Then she went and started talking to the other table again.  
We got up and left, went across the street to another restaurant and I was able to get a bag of peanuts as soon as I walked in the front door.  The waitress at the new restaurant was very concerned about me as she could tell I was not feeling well.  The peanuts did the trick and I felt much better.  We stayed and had a wonderful lunch with terrific service from a waitress who was friendly, smiling and attentive.  

We will never go back to VU."}
{"text":"While in town visiting friends they took us here.
It was great! The place is very small but comfortable. The view is awesome. There is an outside seating area as big as the indoor area but it was a bit chilly for outdoor dining. What a view over the valley!
The food was excellent. I had the bone in rib eye special, cooked just as I ordered it. My wife had the halibut special after asking a neighboring table how it was. Surprisingly great!! In Arizona no less.
Our hosts were equally pleased.
They had music, A great singer accompanying recorded music. Very nice. The owner was very visible and the chef came out to visit the tables. Both good indicators of a quality restaurant in my opinion. 
All in all a great dinner and perfect experience. I would go back at anytime.  With tip for our waiter John, who was very good, we were at $200."}
{"text":"You are seriously missing out if you don't stop and enjoy the amazing view, great service and consume the great product. View is a million dollars. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"Awesome views!  It's gets 3 stars just for that.  The atmosphere is cozy and relaxing. It's Friday night, They have live music outside with a guy playing soft rock from 60s, 70s and 80s (James Taylor, Eagles, and America). He's not bad. Music adds to the enjoyment. Order a bottle of wine and chill out... it's a 5 star experience.  

Now for the food.  It was good, not great. But for the $$, it's a very good value.  My only frustration was the service. It was slow like molasses. 

I am definitely returning!!! If they work out the kinks, this will get 5 stars for sure.  Do not hesitate to try this place."}
{"text":"They must be paying people to write good reviews because this place is the worst service I have ever had from start to finish and the food was mediocre at best. 
The view from the patio is great but definitely did not make up for the poor experience."}
{"text":"Next time we come out to Eagle Mountain Inn we will definitely be eating here this is our first time in. Fabulous service and food."}
{"text":"I would give them a BIG ZERO if I could.  The service blows. The food was cold.  No one checked on us. No one cared.  No manager when asked for one.  All I can say is summer is coming and you can't afford to lose the locals.  It will be a long dry summer for VU Bistro...I won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I walked in the door, and was kindly greeted by the bartender.  At that point the customer service pretty much stopped.  I sat for 20 minutes before the server acknowledged me, and another 10 after she dropped off some menus at which point I left.  I sat there for 30 MINUTES without so much as a glass of water!"}
{"text":"I'm a local, but this was my first time here. 

PRO: Ambiance is a major plus (live music will have that effect on you). Very 'chillaxing. During the day, the view is just beautiful. You can see all of fountain hills below the patio, and the backdrop is what most Arizonans will be proud for--the breathtaking view. The food is pretty good, not overly proportioned but just satisfying in appetite. 
 
CON: the service takes FOREVER. You're lucky if you get your food within 20 mins of ordering. And I mean at every part of my dining experience, this place is slow. The time it took for me to get my food was  long, the time it took to get a refill was extra long, and the time it took for them to bring out the check (let alone getting back your credit card), makes it not even worth it. 

in summary, I'd go here if I wanted to casually impress a group of friends for a good value, but be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Food was great. Wrong but great learned after a long wait and not the greatest service they didn't have what I wanted so they just changed what I ordered for me... Or the waitress just didn't write it down and didn't remember. Not worth it to tell her although she offered to fix it as she brought the check. Kind of disappointing. 

Ps one item at a time salt, drink, drink, sauce, flatware.... You understand."}
{"text":"It's a shame that a place with such a beautiful view functions so inefficiently that they cannot service their customers.  We have previously had appetizers and lunch which were fairly good aside from the completely soggy, grease-laden fries that accompanied the sandwiches and which were essentially inedible. The service has always been slow, however tonight, the service was non-existent.

We arrived at 5pm to enjoy some drinks on a beautiful afternoon.  The policy of this restaurant is that for anyone who wishes to sit outside, you simply seat yourself and if you find the wrought iron chairs to be less than comfortable, you will be directed by staff to a pile of cushions in the entryway that you may place upon your chair.  Really?  Can't the staff set up the patio when it's 85 degrees and they will clearly have a good turnout for dinner?  My husband selected two cushions from the motley pile of mismatched cushions which apparently correspond to the mishmash of random tables and chairs that appear to have been purchased at a series of garage sales and placed them on our chairs (we were aware of this policy having been here before).  Then the wait began....and lasted....and lasted....for over 20 minutes until my husband finally walked up to the bar and ordered our drinks.  Of course they were so sorry and said they would bring the drinks right over.  Ten minutes later, a woman attempted to carry my glass of wine and my husband's beer over and somehow managed to drop my wine, obviously shattering the glass on the patio near a table of other guests.  She delivered the beer, attempted to pick up the major pieces of glass and then disappeared.  Some time later, my wine appeared after the server offered it to all other tables in the near vicinity, not knowing where it belonged.  No one ever bothered to sweep up the remaining broken glass and we heard others crunching through it.  Really?  Shouldn't shards of glass be a priority cleanup?

Once we finished our first round of drinks, we again waited...and waited...until finally a server noticed our empty glasses and offered a refill.  The second round of drinks was brought by a busser and we asked for our check to end this mishap.  She disappeared and 15-20 minutes later finally reappeared with the check.  My husband immediately provided her with our credit card which she left with and did not reappear until at least 15 minutes later, at which time we were both finished with our drinks and just wanting to leave and end this miserable experience.

The inefficiencies have been tolerable in the past when we were some of the only customers, but needless to say, we will not be returning after this non-existent service experience."}
{"text":"The views were amazing and the patio was nice. Our food was very good.

Too bad we had some bad service. Very strange, no hostess. Got sat and no one came by to get us water for 30 minutes. When food arrived we were asked if we wanted silverware and a napkin..... Of course."}
{"text":"restaurant has a immaculate view of the valley.  Too bad the food and service are not up to par.  Also, the attitude of the owner is a complete turnoff.  I'd she can't put a smile on her face she should get out of the restaurant business"}
{"text":"The view is amazing. Nothing else is! Went with a large group, reservation was made weeks in advance. Upon arrival, no tables set up, it took them 15 minutes just to find someone to set up the furniture! Everyone had already arrived and we were waiting for places to sit. Service was a joke- had to beg for drinks and the prices of them were truly outrageous. The food was expensive but good. I accidentally left my sweater on the chair, called the next day and was told I had to speak to the manager! WHAT? Manager never called back, called for a week to no avail. Stopped by on the way home from work and was told, sorry we don't have it! I am certain it was left there. too bad, I loved that sweater. Anyway, overall this place is pretentious, overpriced and crappy service. 4 jack and cokes = over $40 tab and then tip! Will not return. And by the way, the parking lot SUCKS!"}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times now and I like it (EXCEPT for the service).  The patio is a nice spot to grab a drink and enjoy the stars and valley's twinkling lights.  I'm not sure if entertainment is weekends only, but one night when we were there it was a solo guy singing 70s/80s/90s tunes and playing guitar -- pretty good.

They have a decent selection of wines.  The kobe burger and filet quesadillas are delicious!  This is seriously one of the best burgers I have ever eaten - YUM.  Yes, it takes a while for the burger to cook but it is made to order.  If you want a quick, pre-made patty head down the road to one of the fast food joints.

On each visit the service has been unsatisfactory.  I hope the owner does more to promote the place as it is not easy to find (typical of FH, no large street sign) and I think there is great potential to make this place a Fountain Hills hot spot with just a few improvements to to service issues."}
{"text":"vu bistro now has an amazing new chef with a creative, fun, & different approach to cooking that is out of this world, with chefs constantly revolving menu a level 3 sommelier is pairing wines and is behind the bar making outstanding cocktails. not only is the view beautiful but so are the desserts that are made by there new pastry chef. together this new team has set the bar and i hope that they keep it up!"}
{"text":"Wonderful evening in a beautiful setting.  The food was excellent.  Best crab cakes in the valley. Pizzas are great. A must go!  Casual yet great for a special occasion.  I will be a regular!  Best kept secret in the area.   Friendly staff. Go to relax and enjoy the view and food and company."}
{"text":"The location and view was awesome. I was not impressed with the service or organization. Waiter was slow, we were ready 30 mins before he was and he was not attentive. We had a reservation and they were not ready for us. The food was good but they bumped up the price for the night. Not sure I would go back with so many other restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"I usually have a wonderful experience here, but I am so upset about my experience last night that must write a review. While my aunt was in town we wanted to take here here for a glass of wine, some food and to of course enjoy the view. We sat ourselves outside on the couches as no one greeted us at the host stand. After about 5 min I went and got us our own menus. After about 20 minutes of no one approaching us for water or anything, I asked the bus boy if we had a waiter/waitress. He apologized and I think maybe another 5-10 min went by and a waiter came over. He propped his foot up on they able and pulled out his notepad. The table where we would be eating, he puts his shoe. The worst of it that he came to our table with an attitude and chip on his shoulder. I was told they have lattes and drip coffee but they're so busy he can't get me a latte because they are made by hand. I was surprise to be told that because they are busy, I can't order a latte? Ok... So my aunt then asks what type of wine is the house wine and apparently that was the last straw for this guy. He blurted out to us that \"he was just going to get us a woman waitress!\" And stormed off. I think we were all in such awe that a service staff would act this way because we asked a few simple questions about the menu and because they were busy that night. Wow. I hope this guy is not on their regular waitstaff because he's a detriment to the business. We certainly walked out right then and there."}
{"text":"First off, the food was good. Not great, but good. We got the Kobe burger and the Turkey sandwich, both delicious.I'd eat there again...but here were the problems:

1) We went on a night where there was a private party that took up the whole dining room so we had to eat at the bar, losing the good view that the restaurant claims to have. The only view we had was a couple macking away.

2) The worst factor of all: the weird DJ that BLASTED music throughout the restaurant. We thought that the ambiance was supposed to be part of the VU's appeal but it was the worst part of the night. If we wanted to hear deafening, bouncing club beats and DJs singing karaoke and being the MC of the night, we would've went to Scottsdale. We literally had to yell to hear each other talk.

Safe to say we'll never be back there with that kind of experience. Hopefully future private parties they plan won't be so disruptive."}
{"text":"We went tonight for the first time and had a wonderful evening.  Really enjoyed the live entertainment.  The food was amazing, great customer service.  Heidi & Brian were AWESOME!!!  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the VU restaurant recently. My wife and I shared appetizers for our meal. We ordered the Shrimp in a lemon caper sauce and some wings. The food was tasty especially the sauce for the shrimp. The wings are not spicy but had a nice flavor and came with what looked like fresh made blue cheese dressing, which was good.

The bartender was our server and she was good, never letting our drinks run out and checking on us from time to time.

The view is quite nice as you are looking over the desert out toward Mesa.

The atmosphere is really just a sports bar with a patio. The bar dominates the space and there are several TV's at the bar. Tables made from barrels surround the bar.

All that said, I find the prices high for what you get. $16 for four shrimp and $9 for 5 small wings. If this were an upscale restaurant I could see the reason for the prices but not at what is essentially a sports bar. If the reason they charge more for the food is the view, then it's not worth their prices, it's Fountain Hills, there are great views everywhere."}
{"text":"Our small group of six found this establishment on Yelp while at a conference in Fountain Hills.    We were all surprised by just how good it was.   It would have been great to get there early enough to enjoy the fabulous sunset that I bet early diners witness from the phenomenal views from Vu's windows and outdoor seating.   I would love a restaurant like this to open near my home!   I enjoy eating a little bit of a few things, so I went for the small plates.   I had the lamb appetizer, and it was cooked to perfection!  I also shared the BLT salad with one of my table mates, and that was spectacular, too.   The service was friendly, but could have been slightly more on top of our table as the restaurant didn't seem very busy the evening we were there.   The owner (was not our server), was extremely friendly and fun.  Vu is on my \"To Do\" list the next time I am in Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"The Vu is a very cute little restaurant with a breathtaking view. We sat on the patio overlooking the entire valley and it was by far one of the best I've ever seen. I had wine which was a rosa champagne blend with wine and it was delicious. We shared the Bruschetta platter which was delicious!! After we decided split the personal pizza and we were pretty disappointed :( The pizza just wasn't that good. its tastes like doughy microwavable pizza. I would go back because the bruschetta and wine were great and maybe it was just a bad night. I'll just try something else."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places.  Arrived for a late lunch around 2:30 on a Friday afternoon. Had the day off and my friend was visiting so we ordered two plates to share and two napa Chardonnays. The antipasta plate was a amazing, quite the variety.  The ceaser was perfection, lite, served with an amazing piece of toasted bread. The waitress made pleasant conversation with us and really made my friend feel welcome since it was her first time.  Do I even have to mention the views??? Amazing amazing amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Two & a half stars for VU Bistro because the view isn't really that great, service is really slow, portions are too small, and the menu is overpriced. 

There are a lot of houses in the immediate area so the view really is primarily of houses & a road. The view is prettier from the street that this restaurant is off of. The service was super slow when my boyfriend & I went on a Saturday afternoon even though there weren't many people there - it took forever for someone to take our order and then the food took a really really long time to come out. 

The food itself was pretty good but the portions were generally quite small. We shared the bruschetta  appetizer which was my favorite dish from the night. The apple, brie, sugared walnuts slices were great and the garlic rubbed on the bread was a nice touch. The traditional tomato bruschetta was also really good with lots of fresh garlic & basil. The salad I got was rather basic, very tiny, there were barely any toppings, and the balsamic vinaigrette was boring. My boyfriend's bbq chicken pizza was better but very small & the chicken was tossed onto the pizza after it was done baking so none of the chicken actually stuck to the pizza and lacked the flavors that would normally come from the combination of sauce and cheese.

Basically this place strikes me as a place cougars go to drink a lot of wine...a great scene for some & not for others, depending on your preference."}
{"text":"Sad...for a restaurant that has so much potential to be this bad. Service is weak, menu is weak, & our overall experience HORRIBLE! If they were able to get some serious help in there they could be a GREAT property. The only this this property is good for is the VIEW a a bottle of wine...skip the food as it will always be sub par. The owner needs to step aside & let someone who knows what there doing manage the property as she is unable."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business? Went back after a long hiatus - wondering if I had been too hard on this restaurant's slow service and mediocre food. Sadly, it turns out, first impressions are correct. Went there on a saturday afternoon - we were only one of two tables with customers (which should have been a warning sign. After taking over an hour and fifteen minutes, I politely inquired to the server (turned out to be the owner) about how much longer it would be as it was taking an excessively long time to receive our food. Rather than being apologetic, sympathetic or understanding, she said that \"all of our food is made to order.\" When I said that this was not an explanation - that every quality restaurants' food is made to order, and all that we had ordered were sandwiches, she suggested that we go to Subway and cancelled our food order. Really? You have a total of 8 customers on a beautiful Saturday afternoon and this isn't a clue to you that you are doing many things wrong?"}
{"text":"The view is great, but do you want that to be the best part of a restaurant? This was the worst, nastiest service I've ever encountered!
No reason to go there. No reason at all."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place,  the food was awesome , the ambient,  the view. Everything was amazing. Ohhh the people that work here! Super!! They are so sweet and gentle and for sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"A great place to hang out! A beautiful view and great food! The burger and fries is always awesome, and for dessert, the brownie and ice scream is fantastic"}
{"text":"The views from VU were beautiful, but from there it was all downhill. Extremely poor and slow service on a Friday night. Only 2 servers and we were basically ignored all evening. I had to get up from the table and go inside twice; to ask to have our order taken, and to ask where our meals were. We also received a different table's check. And when I complained, the waiter told me I was rude! No apologies, no comp appetizer or drink. Just a feeling of entitlement on their part. I was very disappointed. And food wasn't even that good. Bruschetta bread wasn't toasted and was simply doughy. Chicken on my sandwich was tough. Not a place I would visit again."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER AT A RESTAURANT!
This is so disappointing to have to write about. This last summer our family and my husbands family bought vacation homes in Fountain Hills. My husbands family was visiting from England and I told them we should definitely stop by the Vu. I had been there once and the views and food were delicious. 

This time we arrived at 8pm and there were just a couple tables there of people. No music this time (last time it was fabulous) but it was a Thursday. We ordered a few drinks and they came pretty quickly. We also ordered food and that was a problem all together. 

We ordered a caprese salad, 3 calamari's, seared ahi, 3 kobe burgers, 1 pasta dish, and 1 risotto. 45 minutes later we had only received the ahi. We had some starving folks so we asked if any bread would be available. The waiter was not very friendly with a response and finally said but yes I can get you some. Did not provide any update on how much longer our food would take. 

Then one person asked to see a wine menu and again the waiter in an unfriendly tone said \"why don't you just ask me\". My sister-in-law was a bit taken back by the response and quickly tried to figure out what she might want. It seemed like it was a burden to him to get a wine list. He took her order and walked off. I walked in and just picked up a menu for her to look at for her next drink choice. 

Then 15 minutes later, no wine and no additional food (no appetizers or salads even). Now it's been an hour and we've had not updates, no water refills, not any friendly visits from the waiter at all. Everyone was so hungry and the restaurant was pretty empty (only two other tables)! 

My husband decided to get up and speak to the waiter. As he did the waiter came with a plate of bread and one caprese salad (why did it take an hour for an uncooked caprese salad?). My husband said, \"Whew that was close, we were getting ready to walk out!!\". The waiter quickly snapped back \"but why?\" and that set off a lot of angry hungry people. The waiter continued to argue with no apologies at all for the length of time it was taking or reasons. All he seemed he could add was \"your kobe burgers aren't even ready\". (yes....that is our point). He didn't even realize we hadn't received our calamari either. He was so rude and unapologetic it was truly shocking!! 

My husband asked to see the manager and the waiter said \"I kind of am the manager\". So my husband said there's no way we can stay here now, we want to pay our bill and leave.  The waiter gave him a bill for $98 dollars. lol it included a bunch of the food we hadn't even received. He fixed it for him in a major huff and saying \"here's something you won't be having\" in a way that he was trying to make us feel guilty. So awful! 

We ended up leaving right after to try to find another restaurant. Which in Fountain Hills is very difficult after 9pm. The best we could find was the The All American Sports Grill. We went in sat down and instantly started to have way better service from the staff there than at the Vu. They were actually friendly, smiling and helpful.  We also received food within 10-20 minutes (varied based on appetizers and burgers) and it was still pretty tasty. 

If Vu would have been friendly, showed a bit of \"care\" in their attitude and communicated a bit better I'm sure we would have been patient and waited even though it was taking so long. We just had no idea if it was going to be 5 minutes more or 45 minutes more. Really ridiculous and a huge disappointment as I had high hopes for this being one of our favorites in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Gr8 time at VU, music was very good and not overly loud. Gr8 food and drink. Always Gr8 seeing Heidi.  Service was a bit slow but not a problem.  Recommend  it."}
{"text":"Good service,  jack and Heidi we're amazing.  good service, good food, and a good view.  They had live music on the patio.  We came on a Saturday night.  It was Relaxing and we enjoyed ourself."}
{"text":"We only went in for a drink to check it out. I think they just opened. They didn't seem to be ready. The views were amazing. Menu looks interesting. The mother and daughter owners were they. Our waitress the daughter was very nice. I hope to go back and try for a sunset happy hour and food next time."}
{"text":"The actual VIEW itself is gorgeous,  unfortunately for the restaurant that's the best part.

I was with a party of 4 on Halloween and the place was mostly empty. There was live music so that was ok too. The food was mediocre and so was the service. I feel like they care more about their boutique and salon than the restaurant portion. Service is slow and nonchalant about making a good impression,  so they usually don't. 

The drink menu sucked. I just prefer to give my patronage to a place that cares whether you come back or not."}
{"text":"Just left after sitting in the restaurant (as brand new residents!) for over 20 mins without even so much as a glance or acknowledgement from anyone.  They weren't that busy and we won't be back. Staff actually went out of their way to avoid eye contact.  Too many other great choices for food  to at least say hi to us and grab a water- so now headed to Scottsdale.   Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Lovely view.  Service was OK.  They were attentive but seemed marginally trained.  Only one other couple dining this night.  The outdoor seating has a mix of wire tables and round stone tables.  There is an area reminicient of a frat house with a beat up couch and a couple of glass tables.  The food was OK.  The stone table was stained from previous sauce spills and somewhat unappealing.  At a minimum they should have used place mats.
Might be a nice place for drinks and appetizers but their appetizer menu was a few bar food type items. We won't go back even though the view is awesome.  Without some changes I suspect they will be under new management soon."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the very first time on Tuesday to have a business meeting.  It was scenic and beautiful when we sat outside, for being the only 4 people there the service was probably on the slow side.  But we had time to sit and wait, since we had a lot to discuss and it perhaps they were being courteous and letting us talk, but a refill on the drinks would have been great for our parched mouths.

The burger was really good, I ordered a Kobe Bacon hamburger, which is 8oz of yummy goodness.  Although, I need to watch my weight I opted for sweet potato fries and they were excellent.

The burger was pricey but reasonable for the area and the Kobe beef, which I've had small portions of steak at other places and have paid a fortune for it.  

None the less, if you are there with friends, they will enjoy the view and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"First off, I am a waiter from the east coast and I know the difference between good and bad service. The service here is absolutely terrible. Our waitress was too busy talking to her friend at the bar, and then left the restaurant to talk on the phone. We ordered two rare burgers which arrived well-done thirty minutes later. Not only that, we had heard the bell ring in the kitchen, so did she, yet she continued to talk to her friend at the bar. When she took our order she gave us a snarky attitude. The location and the view is beautiful, but I would never go back."}
{"text":"I will put up the Vu's Kobe burger up against anyone's. Not the fanciest with all these gourmet burgers out there, but 5 stars. I wll also say its one of the best views you can get. There are others in the valley, but anywhere in sniffing distance of Fountain Hills, this is a great spot. Live music also."}
{"text":"Stopped in early evening while visiting fountain hills. Well the location of this place is great and offers truly fantastic southern views. If you decide to come here I would recommend sitting on the patio to take full advantage of the views. 

As for the rest: the food is adequate but in a town that has some great food adequate just isn't enough. The service is slow and not very attentive. Servers make you feel like a burden when they do show up. As for the drinks they are standard. I would prefer a more creative drink menu but if a place stays to the basics they better do them darn well and they just are not. 

It seems like someone paid great attention to finding location and decor but not enough time on wait staff training or drink and food development. This place might be worth going back once it closes and someone opens a new place in the location because the view is the only thing good at the VU"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. The food is great, the view outside is awesome. The only thing I would like to see get better is the wait time. There have been times where my table is the only one in the restaurant and it still takes an hour or more to be served our meals. Other than that, the inside decor, bar & restrooms are great. If you're looking for a classy spot for date night in town, this is it. Be sure to call ahead to insure they are open. Heidi the owner is friendly and accommodating. Great place :)"}
{"text":"I brought a group of local business people to happy hour at the VU Bistro and everyone enjoyed the food, drinks, service and especially the gorgeous views of the Valley of the Sun. What a View from the VU. Perched several hundred feet over the Valley below we could see for miles. The weather was great as was our experience at the VU."}
{"text":"Vu Bistro has an amazing new chef and bar tender, and of course a spectacular view.  Definitely my and my fiancés favorite date place."}
{"text":"I had my husbands 50th birthday party there. Heidi was extremely accommodating as we had to change plans and move party from patio to dining room due to weather. I met with Heidi a few days before party and we went over the menu and preselected the food and finalized last minute details. The dining room that we were in was so cute and cozy for my 24 guests. Everyone was served drinks and I felt like we were constantly attended to. Appetizers were great, dinner was great and when I looked around everyone always had a drink. My guests were impressed as many had not been there before. I appreciated Heidi helping me choose the menu and I was able to stay right on budget. Thank you for making my husbands party a success! I would host another party there."}
{"text":"I've never had any food here, so I can also speak for the drinks. Came here recently to enjoy the sunset and have drinks with the family. Our waiter was awesome - funny and even brought us blankets for the chilly weather. Many thanks for the excellent service and great view!"}
{"text":"We forget about this gem, but have been coming here since it opened. The food has really evolved into something special! The salmon is Delicious and the BBQ  chicken salad is quite tasty and filling. You can never complain about the view or the wine.  They are going though some upgrades which will be great in the fall. Make sure when you visit to relax and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"Let's first start with one star because they don't offer a zero star option.  The Vu was recommended by a hostess at a different restaurant that was overbooked.  We were able to get a reservation at the Vu for 4 people.  They sat us promptly at an outdoor table, very nice and the view was awesome.  About 10 minutes later, we still hadn't ordered a beverage, so I went to the bar and asked a waitress about placing an order, her response was they were very busy and she'd send someone over in about 2 minutes.  I went back and instructed our group to have our food order ready so we could order drinks and dinner at the same time.  Two minutes turned into ten minutes which turned into 20 minutes, which is when we got up and left without ever seeing a server in 30 minutes.  What a waste of time, as the waitress I spoke to saw us get up and leave and never even acknowledged us.  This service was YELP worthy, so as I brought up The Vue on YELP, it really didn't surprise me to see some of the negative reviews, I'm just sorry we didn't look them up before we fell into the same trap.  Sometimes a bad situation turns into a good one, we were so hungry we found an Italian restaurant not far, Marco's Italian Bistro.  I recommend you read our review of Marco's.  This was a lesson learned..............."}
{"text":"This place needs help. I have never seen anything so disorganized ever. The lady behind the bar shouts orders and does nothing. Seriously needs help. Call Chef Ramsey !"}
{"text":"This is THE hidden gem of Fountain Hills.
Please don't go if you are in a hurry or an impatient type...this place, it's staff and food are served AND enjoyed in a relaxed and friendly manner.  Heidi can be described as a welcoming funny hostess and proprietor...I love mingling with the regulars and hope this place never changes!"}
{"text":"The view is wonderful, the food and service are just okay.  I find it strange that reviews are like mine or 5 star.  Our meal was good.  The problem, mainly, was that salad that I ordered and the soup my husband ordered was delivered at the same time as our main course.  It was all too much at once.  The food tasted okay and was a decent size. I would return again, but would just buy a sandwich and a beer.  When we were there on a Thursday there was only one other party."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Vu Bistro for lunch on a Friday. The view was great, but we were literally the only 2 people in there besides the waitress and some other lady who appeared to either work at the restaurant or be a hair stylist. Either way, we ordered our food and waited 40 minutes for it even though we were the only people there. About 30 min into our wait we saw our waitress pull up in her car and run back into the restaurant. We thought maybe she went somewhere else to get our salad and hamburger, but found out she just had to take her dog home.....at least that's what she told her mom on the phone when she called the restaurant a few minutes later. The food had obviously been sitting out while she was running errands and was lukewarm. I was a little afraid of the lukewarm chicken on my salad so I just are a few fries that were also on the cold/undercooked side. Such a bummer because the view is gorgeous and this could be a really great place. Instead it was odd and awkward with mediocre at best service."}
{"text":"Great food, let's start there. The view as all the reviews mention is beautiful. Based on those two this place would get 5 stars. 
Our service was good not slow the food came out on time almost fast. I can see if this place is packed it would be slow service, as there was only one sever who doubles as the bartender. But for us service was good.
The restaurant was not well put together as it doubles as a boutique and renovations have not been completed. It has a very eclectic look. The outside furniture is not that comfortable and should stand out as the views are amazing. Other than that definitely worth the stop and visit"}
{"text":"I come here for the amazing views and I like to support local businesses. I recommend dining outside on their patio with a sweeping view of the south - especially right before sunset! They have live music also at times.

Their menu options are quite broad, which is great, but their prices seem inflated for what you get. Portions are rather small, IMO.

Service is okay but nothing spectacular. I see this place having a HUGE opportunity to be spectacular if they made some changes to menu prices, replaced worn tables outside, etc.

I'd also suggest more in-depth training for all staff. I really don't know anything about wine. Really don't. Except that reds go w/beef nicely and whites go w/poultry/fish. I would think at this type of restaurant, a staff member can give me some good recommendations and a brief description if I have a question on a wine. Don't you?"}
{"text":"Had a 7:30 dinner reservation. Seated on time, then sat completely ignored for the next 15 minutes - no server, no water, nothing. Went up to the desk to complain, was told that we would she would get someone immediately. Five more minutes, went back up and told them we were leaving. No apology, no acknowledgement that they screwed up. I think 20 minutes is plenty of time to have a server at least stop by and acknowledge our existence. We are new to the area and eat out a lot; trying this place for the first (and last) time. They lost a potential regular."}
{"text":"Since our first visit in May, 2013, we've been back to the Vu many times.  I gave this restaurant a 5-star rating back then and I think the food and service was even better last night!  My husband and I went there with my brother (from Colorado) and another friend (from Kansas City).  The my husband and the 2  guys had the filet mignon (which they always have when they visit) and I had the quesadilla filet mignon (I'm a WI Cheesehead that \"needs her cheese fix\"!  Starting with the 3 different appetizers, 2 different salads, and through the entrees to 2 different desserts, EVERYTHING was OUTSTANDING!  Thank you Heidi for another wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"New staff, new menu, amazing food, amazing view and great company if you sit at the bar!
I have been there twice now since their changeover and everything was top notch both times.  Great place for a girls night (pedicures next door, then head over for great food & drinks) or a romantic date night on the patio."}
{"text":"Efficient, friendly service. Excellent food with reasonable prices. Incredible view.  Great local hang out - intimate inside but fantastic patio. 
We plan on a monthly visit to watch the seasons change with wine and a delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"Over-worked server with a great attitude and humour made up for slow kitchen and over-priced menu.  The view was partly foggy but our drinks were always freshed and tasty.  I would come again--hopefullu they will have more help."}
{"text":"Our group of five was looking for a quiet, local place to enjoy dinner.  We could not have asked for a better location.  The view, simply amazing.  The atmosphere, quirky and vibey.  The salads were gorgeous and tasty.  The appetizers looked like a Top Chef quick fire challenge winner.  The entrées were almost flawless.  

I personally had the filet mignon and loved it.  Everyone had dessert.  Visually, if they tasted half as good as they looked, Vu is a shining star in the Fountain Hills area.

Only complaints:  Everyone had to keep asking for refills when the server could easily see in the empty glasses in the 1/8 filled restaurant.  Getting information via phone since they share the line with their salon and boutique.  I couldn't get immediate info and had to call back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere....great views...excellent service...outstanding steak!...and an outside act that was very talented...we all wondered why he was entertaining the patio...and not at a bigger venue--

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I would give it a no star if it was an option.  This past Wednesday night 4/4/18, my husband and I arrived at the VU to have a nice dinner.  We sat down outside at a table and after about 5-10 minutes we were  asked if we wanted anything to drink. Water was brought to us.  After 15 minutes of waiting we asked one of the employees if we could put in our order.  We were told our waitress would be over.  15 minutes later we asked again with the same response.  After 40 minutes of NO service or waitress we walked out.  Owner..Read your yelp reviews.  Your service is beyond pitiful!  Do you not get it?  or do you just not care. People do yourselves a favor and don't waste your time going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We only wish we had arrived in  time to enjoy sunset-what an amazing setting!  The food was good but the dessert (the bread pudding) wasw DIVINE. Not the fastest service but friendly.  We would go there again absolutely."}
{"text":"Only 2 tap beers! Pricey beer/drinks. 1/4 Wedge salad for $9.95!  

Great view.  Mediocre service.  This place is really missing out on an opportunity to maximize revenue from their amazing patio/location/view."}
{"text":"Friends asked us to meet them at the VU last night for some chow and fireworks since they have probably the best VIEW on the valley from their terrace.  We arrived around 7pm and the place was not very busy.  We sat down and our friends had not arrived yet.  We were in the mood for Kobe Burgers which were on their menu posted on their web site.  The waitress was very nice, handed us menu's and announced that they had a new chef and tonite was the release of their new menu.  UUURRGGHH  there goes our burgers.  We found out that their new chef came from Tempe's House of Tricks.  That was a relief because all the times I had been there it has held up.  Our friends arrived and we ordered a round of drinks while we all took in the menu.  I ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich which came in a great sauce with a kick and some slaw on a bun.  Pretty good.  Two other dishes from the new menu that our party had was a great lightly grilled salmon on a bed of organic greens with a nice tart dressing.  We also experienced the steak which was very flavorful, but on the fatty side.

The best part of the whole evening was the entertainment.  I was told that this singer is there on Friday and Saturday evenings.  He was incredible.  Quite and experience.  He sounds almost like the original artists of the songs he covers.  Great voice and tons of energy.  Food was good for bar food, but the entertainment was some of the best I have experienced in the valley.  A Must Experience!!!"}
{"text":"Freshly cooked food and A committed owner make all the difference. The barbecue chicken pizza is to die for."}
{"text":"Finally getting to write my review, can let my better half get ahead of me. We ended up at this place thanks to Groupon, so prices were certainly acceptable, but even then, we'll certainly come back with a group.

THE FOOD

Being a gourmand extraordinaire, I ordered... a chicken sandwich. And it was good. Nothing spectacular due to the nature of it being a chicken sandwich, but I had nothing to complain about. The meat was juicy, the bread and greens were fresh. We also ordered calamari for appetizer. They were small by my hungry food per dollar measurement, but again, properly done and not fried to hell like some places like to do. To top it off, the place has lambics, which in itself is awesome.

SETTING

The restaurant appears to be made up of three distinct areas. At the entrance from the street you have a dining and bar area, a bit deeper and adjacent to the spa is an almost separate dining area (better lit by the daylight) and then you have the very large patio. Unfortunately the weather was too hot for us to be outside, but the inside was rather nice. One of these times will have to bring a few friends over for the patio portion, the view is rather good.

SERVICE

Overall good, if a little overbearingly pleasant.

OTHER

Can get a little confusing with finding the entrance at first."}
{"text":"Brought my family here from out of town and had an amazing time. Not only was the view amazing at sunset time but the food and service was exceptional. You get a view of the golf course and city lights at night. They also had live music that was really enjoyable. I appreciate the great service though since it's hard to find anymore. Had the sesame ahi tuna appetizer and mash potatoes. Great place! I'd highly recommend. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Food was fine.  View was great.  But, service was horrible.  My friend wanted to return the wine because 2 flies had flown into it.  They finally said ok, but they would have to take the first 2 glasses out of it!  The owner was eitherly not telling us the truth or being extremely petty!  This was my second turn back to their restaurant.  Hadn't been there in about 7 years.  We WONT be back!!!  And if I could give it lower than 1 star, I would!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times over the years and each time hopeful it will have gotten better and each time it doesn't.

Last night was another example of why we say we are not going to go back and after several years, try again and then say the same thing.
It was a beautiful warm spring day that sparked our desire to have a patio drink and dinner and Vu Bistro came to mind, since it is close to home.  

We checked on line and entertainment was reported to start at 6:30.  We got there at 6:15 and settled in at a table with two chairs.  The waitress came over and said they wanted to keep that table for four people and asked us to move, which we said we liked the table and wanted to be near the music.  She was not happy, but we were and most places the customer is right (not here!).

We have always been amazed this place is still in business as the staff and owner always seem grumpy and unfriendly.

In a nutshell......the service was very slow and unfriendly, the entertainment finally started playing at 7:15 and were awful!  Both singers were off key and most songs boring.  After hunting down our waitress and asking to have our order taken, our food finally arrived (cold) an hour after it was ordered, it was so dark we couldn't see what we were eating and we couldn't eat fast enough to get out of there and get away from the whole scene.  

One of the waiters, was in such a frenzy, running back and forth that just watching him wore us out.  He was really wired.

Our experience was more of the same and this time we will not go back.  Instead, dinner on our own lovely patio, with our choice of music and tranquility.  

You can keep your Vu!"}
{"text":"A reasonable facsimile of a California bistro in the desert.  

The decor is pretty decent for Fountain Hills but the TVs over the bar are the first clue this is not a serious restaurant.

For some reason, several of the heat lamps were broken (even though they were still in the middle of the patio).  Also, we called in advance and the hostess \"forgot\" to mention that the indoor area was booked by a private party.  

The food is decent but not great.  Our pizza crust was a bit doughy and had that \"industrial cheese\" flavor you get from a frozen pizza.  The seafood seemed to have been frozen or come from a can.  Service upon ordering was a bit slow but the dude with the water pitcher kept us hydrated until the drinks arrived. 

That said, its one of the better places in Fountain Hills.  There's an entertaining lounge singer on weekends.  Oh, and the view isnt bad either."}
{"text":"As long as diners want to eat looking out on a view for hundreds of miles, The Vu will stay open for business.  And Heidi, the owner, and some of the staff, very well know this.  So their attitude is surly, curt, and the service is awful.  Average time to be served is thirty minutes. 
A party of four visited The Vu last week.  Two of us ordered the chicken salad. I specifically requested NO cilantro, because this menu offering clearly states the dish comes with cilantro.  Heide  wrote this on her order pad.  Sure enuf, the chix salad comes loaded with cilantro.  I tried to pick it out but it was impossible.  I did not return my meal out of  social politeness to the others in our party.  But when we checked out, I told Heidi about the cilantro.  Her response was that there was NO cilantro in the dinner because  even tho it is on the menu, they do not use cilantro in any of their food because so many people do not like it.  My friend  who had the same cilantro-loaded dish just looked at me and rolled her eyes.  
We will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went to support local musicians and they were great and the view even better... That's where I'll stop on the positives.  1.25 hrs to get bruschetta and entrées no where in sight 20 mins later.  We had crying, hungry kids and walked out.  I've never done that!  My favorite quote from a blonde who wasn't as hot as she thought she was \"honey, I don't cook the food and I work for free\" and left.  Never going again."}
{"text":"We were the only two people there, and placed our order (cheese burger & salad) at 620pm.  At 7pm we asked that it be packed to go and paid the bill.   At 715pm we finally walked out without our food.

Certainly don't understand how it could possibly take that long to assemble a salad and cook a hamburger patty.

Slowest service I've ever scene."}
