{"text":"This is the best food at the best price you can get anywhere in Toronto. Seriously. The portions are massive, the cook is super nice, and the prices are incredibly, time-travel-like, cheap. I had a quesadilla that I think they put a whole chicken on and a pound of cheese. It's absolutely fantastic. And the panzerottis are filled to bursting."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting . Bought a slice and found a cockroach in my slice . When I told the lady , she ignored me and wouldn't admit it. Just as bad,  I saw a mouse running. Save your money and go across the street to 241 pizza unless you wanna get the plague"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  No matter how good or cheap people say their food is I will never come here again.  Due to the reviews on Yelp tried 3 attempts to buy food from them and all three times have been turned away because they tell me they don't have enough chicken left when I can see that they have chicken on the roaster/turner.  When I ask them, they said they have to save it for other \"future\" orders.  Excuse me but I'm at your store placing an order but you rather wait and server other invisible people who have yet to come to your store.  Fed up, I asked if they will be making any more chicken, their answer yes but again, we cannot take your order because we don't know how much chicken we will have left WTF!  I feel that this person is either racist or sexist because he is definitely picking and choose who they want to serve."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is delicious. At a cheap price you get really full. What's good about this place is that they really fill your plate to the top. A small container is only $3 and it will easily satisfy you. There are 3 platter sizes. Small, medium, and large. The medium is $5. I'm not sure on the price of the large because I would never dare to order one. It's way too big! They have a variety of foods that are all mouthwatering. (I recommend the chicken wrap) The service is great. The people there are very polite and work to please. Also, it's very clean. This place is somewhere you should definitely go to if you have a case of the munchies and have little money to spend. The only problem is it gets packed at lunch time. However, the service is quick, but even if it wasn't, this Mediterranean style food is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"You bet your ass Albion gets a 5 star yelp rating.   Why?  1 star for the fact that its so damn clean.  1 star for the portions, holy shit huge.  1 star for the price, for real 3 dollars for the small chicken plate that's not small at all.  You'll probably regret ordering the 5$ medium and only eating half.  1 star for the friendly service, they're really nice to me!    1 star for the fact that I can't find anything wrong with the place.  Everything is fresh, tastes good, I never wait too long and if I do it's for a pizza that's more than worth it.    If you're feeling shawarma or pizza there is no reason to go anywhere else.   On tuesdays 2 slices and a pop is $2.50, what is it 1973?"}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever I'm in the area, I make sure to pass by.  Their pizza and shawarma are OFF THE HOOK! The food ALWAYS comes out amazing. The portion is HUGE! I don't know why it's so cheap because everything is so amazing. I'm gonna make sure that I make a visit soon, I need my shawarma fix. Seriously, you can't go wrong with this place, the people are amazing too!"}
{"text":"average shawarma joint ... they give you lots of meat but it was a bit on the dry end... would not return again"}
{"text":"Like all the reviewers said before, you get well over your money's worth at this restaurant.   For just under $6.00 I bought a medium chicken shawarma platter with a drink. They loaded the whole serving tray to a point where it was overflowing with meat and it tasted very good. It also took a very long time to eat as a medium sized platter ends up being enough to feed a family."}
{"text":"Very good shawarma! Good quality for the price. They offer pitas and plates with Shawarma, pizza and wings. I only tried the chicken shawarma plate and it was good even if I found a couple very hard pieces of chicken in it."}
{"text":"I wish that I could really do this place justice, when I lived in Toronto I ate at this place at least 3 times a week. Dollar to dollar it is the best food in the entire world.  The chicken Shawarma on top of a pizza slice with his garlic and hot sauce is my personal favorite. $2.50 will get you a slice piled high with seasoned shawarma. Tuesdays you can get two big slices of pizza with a pop included.  Lastly Albion himself is the nicest guy. Really cares about the customers and greets everyone warmly. The open hours can be irregular but is always worth it. I don't understand how they can stay in business but they do!  Don't order anything larger than a small unless you are able to eat A LOT. Don't be fooled by $3.50 for a small chicken plate over rice or fries, it is a meal. A medium could be split, and a large plate could end hunger in a small country."}
{"text":"Four years since this place opened and they have managed to keep up the quality and keep down the prices.  This has really become a true neighborhood fixture as it delivers massive portions to the masses in a super clean and friendly fashion.  Perhaps the best indicaor is when I see friends who live nowhere around here just drop in for a quick bite.  If you're lucky enough to be close by come on in; you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Clean, fast, friendly, and a great value. Came here based on all the 5 star reviews and can definitely say it lived up to its reputation. Specials everyday? I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place was an average shawarma joint with no character and little authenticity. They didn't even have the usual variety of middle eastern pickles and salads I expect from a shawarma place. Maybe this is due to their focus on pizza. I didn't get an chance to try the pizza. It looked alright, but nothing different from the average by the slice places all over Toronto.  The shawarma was ok. They offer just chicken, no lamb or beef or falafel to be seen. I was a bit surprised when the woman threw a bunch of pineapple in mine. Seemed like they just use the same toppings for pizza and shawarma -- not the same cuisine folks! They put jalape√±os in instead of the more middle eastern style peppers I think go better with the food. Odd choices.  I am pretty baffled by all the five star reviews here. Folks seem amazed by the cleanliness. It seemed clean enough, but I don't give out stars for basic hygiene! Yes it is cheap. Definitely. I had two shawarmas and two cans of pop for $9.99.  If you're looking for cheap pizza maybe this spot is a good option. For shawarma I would give it a miss. Just down the block is a more popular and more authentic shawarma and falafel place called Empire. Check it out."}
{"text":"Tried their veggie slice (sliced tomatoes, green bell peppers, and red onions) and for the price ($1.50) it's absolutely a great value.  The dough is thick and bread-y. Definitely not brick oven, more like toaster oven, and reminded me a bit of Dominoes. But crispy crust and overall delicious."}
{"text":"If you are looking to get some bang for your buck, this is the place to go.  For $6, you can feed a family of 3 and have leftovers.  Saying the portions are massive is an understatement.  You will be in utter disbelief when you see how much food you get for so little money.  And on top of that, the food is excellent.  I have only gotten the quesadilla, and me and my girlfriend couldn't even finish it.  Mind you, I'm a fatboy that loves to eat!  Few restaurants ever give me a portion to satisfy, and Albion's surpasses what I require to feel full.  Tomorrow we will try the panzarotti, which is the same price and the same size.  The chef is nice and friendly, very helpful, and even funny on top of that.  While we were paying, we tried to tip him and he refused to take a tip!  It look's like a hole-in-the-wall, but it is worth every cent.    TRY THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Went in to check out this place after moving to the area and I was pretty impressed. I got a medium chicken plate with rice for about $5. The food was great and a huge portion considering the price, plenty to fill you up. I recommend it to anyone and will return for sure."}
{"text":"Service was fairly quick and really friendly.   I ordered a chicken burrito for about $6 which was huge and delicious. Bonus that the sour cream sauce they use isn't overpowered by the garlic additive!"}
{"text":"New to the Toronto area and I stumbled upon the place for the most unique food on Bloor Street!  Albion and his wife Rozi will serve you with a smile that can light up a room.  They are the owners of this Mediterranean Kitchen featuring, Pizza, Shawarma Wraps, Burritos, Salads, Wings , Panzerotti, Kofta Burgers and my all time favorite the Albion/Rozi Quesadilla.  So what make this place special is the quality of the food and salads, the taste of the sauces, and the presentation of the plates created all with an Albanian twist.  I urge you to try the Kofta Quesadilla for $6.49 you can feed 3 people with this creation.  You have NEVER seen anything like this before, uless you have ordered from Albions before.  Hats off to Albion and Whole Lotta Rozi !!!"}
{"text":"First of all - it is clean... very clean!!!  Like the previous reviewer...  OMG - the chicken shawarma is tooooooo big.  I could only finish half of it....  the chicken and toppings were fresh and the sauces are not too bad.  The pizza lunch special is my kid's favourite...  2 slices and a pop for $2.50 on Tuesdays... can't go wrong with that!!!  Took a bite of the slice and was impressed..  better quality cheese than 2 for 1 (across the street).  Hope it stays this way"}
{"text":"This place is GOLD! So cheap, so delicious. The cooks are so nice and go above and beyond to make you happy. It's almost cheaper to eat here than grocery shop."}
{"text":"I used to go often for the $3 chicken Shawarma plate.  It was an amazingly cheap and delicious meal.  But I can no longer deal with the amount of bone and cartilage I get in each bite of the shawarma meat."}
{"text":"After the tremendous reviews this place has received, I'm very disappointed in Albion's Pizza Shawarma, proved to be a total waste of time.  Alright so Saturday evening say about 5:45pm I called the restaurant and asked what time the places closes, they responded by saying ''whenever the chicken is finished.\" We drove 35 minutes to the location. My girlfriend went in to place our order, lady said \"the chicken wasn't ready.\" We waited 10 minutes and then headed back in  and left empty handed. Apparently the lady said there's quote \"too many orders and refused to serve us food.\"  We counted 3 total patrons and lots of chicken still left on the rotisserie. I have never encountered such poor customer service in my entire life.  We won't be back, not worth our business."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good portions, conveniently located and just awesome."}
{"text":"Great place! Best in the area for sure. Clean, nice people, really good chicken and soo cheap!"}
{"text":"Sad to see this place closed. The hard-working couple who ran this place were really great people, always happy to see regulars and really proud of the food they served.  Anyone knowing if they're reopening somewhere else? Gonna miss those chicken plates!"}
{"text":"First time visitor, coming to this restaurant I did not feel welcome. Though I told the owner/cook it was my first time she gave no smile.  I ordered a large chicken platter wanted to replace rice with fries, but she told me it ONLY came with rice... Ooooook. The salad dressing I wanted on the side. She told me she couldn't do that..\"  OK no salad dressing thank you\"..... Lastly her demeanor towards me was strictly business. \"did I just not tell you this is my first time at your restaurant\". The food was OK (I didn't finish it.... That's says something if a man doesn't finish his food).  Tip: you will not retain old or receive new customers if service does not improve. Be a people person, it goes along way.  *Note: 3 months later* I guess my assessment was correct.:) with bad customer service, no business will survive and will close eventually."}
{"text":"I have been there few times and they have a very good costumer service, fair prices and the food is really good, try the Mexican quesadilla."}
{"text":"Yeah. I don't know this place makes any money at all. 2.50 for a slice piled high in shwarma meat. The place was super clean and the pizza chef was gorgeous. Dude was straight up handsome. The pizza looks and tastes incredible.  Warning: the prices are so low, it might awesome be a front for the mob."}
{"text":"I was told they had opened up somewhere on Bathurst and Wilson but I'm not entirely sure. I could have been lied to."}
{"text":"Very clean was my first impression, then the portion is HUGE, unbeatable. i was so shocked when the first time I ordered it. And it's super cheap too. Chicken is juicy and tender, best shawarma in town!   The owner does carting sometimes, so you will need to try your luck see if it's open."}
