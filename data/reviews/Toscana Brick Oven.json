{"text":"First visit today not very busy but clean and nice location. Waiter M was not attentive did not say if they had specials or recommend anything. Tried straw zucchini all we tasted was the oil it was fried with no flavor was not even hot. Then ordered Pizza which was good and the rest down hill from there. Ordered pasta and meatballs it was lukewarm , asked for shrimp with pasta and was ask how many do you want they are $3.00 a piece.  Really so asked for 5 thinking they must be good and  would be at least a medium size guess what they weren't.   I don't mind spending extra if the food is good has flavor and is HOT not room temperature.   Waiter was just as poor as the food.  Will not return!"}
{"text":"went on a Fri night.  had made reservations asking for certain seating which was accommodated well.  very pleasant waiter who was attentive and help3d make recommendations.  unfortunately, when food came 1 meal was completely wrong order, so that person in our party had to wait much longer.  food was great, though"}
{"text":"Had a private party here and food and service was excellent! Cameron and staff (Andrew , Robin , and Neil) were easy to work with and attended to all our needs!  Thank you for a great night!"}
{"text":"One of my biggest things when dining out is when the server acknowledges a mistake. We got there and we're seated immediately and shortly after the bartender came up to greet us. We got our drinks including a beer for myself. They got to the table almost immediately but then we sat there for a little bit longer than would've liked to when ordering our food and it wasn't busy at all. 

When the bartender finally got over to us we ordered our food and he apologized for taking too long and took the beer off the bill. Something as small as this makes an experience at a restaurant much better. 

For the food we got the bread with the dipping oil. The oil itself was a little too peppery but still good. We both also got the wedding soup which was really good. For our main dishes we got the meatballs and the bolognese. Both pastas were excellent! I would definitely come back to this place. The only downfall is its a little pricey. For the food you get its worth it though."}
{"text":"Tucked into a hard to find spot in growing Southpointe, I was excited to try Toscana based on family recommendations. And while the food was ok, it was nothing extraordinary. Their house made fresh pastas were very overlooked leading to hard edges on lasagna and noodles breaking in the carbonara. The greens and beans were excellent and a Pittsburgh staple, but their tough, chewy veal pieces were a crime. Service was amiable but with poor acoustics for conversation, just an okay marinara sauce, and nothing specifically memorable, we will be exploring other opportunities before returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"We stopped by tonight to try the new addition to the neighborhood - a place which should have amazing brick oven pizza, right?  We were excited.

The place looks great, I'm sure a lot of money was spent on interior decoration.  The bathrooms leave a bit to be desired after being in the dining room, but that's OK.

We started off with the fried zucchini straws ($7) with horseradish sauce and the bibb salad ($6).  The food came out quickly which was a big plus. 

The zucchini straws weren't crunchy - they were actually soft/mushy and tasted like old frying oil with a hint of seafood.  Tasted frozen.  A wedge of lemon would have been great to refresh the palate and cut the fat but none was given.  Overall, highly disappointed.  Would rather go to Fridays and get their breaded string beans.

The bibb salad came out next and this was quite literally a large piece of lettuce with a lot of oil and small pieces of garlic.  No acid or salt /pepper. There were walnuts as promised but we really couldn't taste any grana padano as was advertised.  Nor was there a hint of truffle in the vinaigrette.  This was an awful oily mess.

After letting the server know we were done with the apps since the plates were both full, we received our margherita pizza ($12)! YES!

WAIT. No. 

It's only 10\"?

Oh gosh, the grinch stole any hope of the restaurant redeeming itself.  Where was the sauce?  The charred crust? If you Google \"margherita pizza\" you'll see what we all crave, why we come to a place like this.  Delicious but simple tomato sauce, bubbling fresh buffalo mozzarella and a light fluffy charred crust.

We received a pizza with chopped raw tomatoes and polly-o mozzarella cheese.  That's right. No sauce. The basil chiffonade was a nice touch. But the crust.  

The crust.  It was whiter than Casper the friendly ghost.

It tasted like someone had pulled out some pillsbury frozen dough and used it as the crust.  It had no flavor other than some sort of strange frozen tinge.  Dare I say we should have gone to giant eagle and picked up better frozen pizza?

Overall I'd say give this restaurant a miss and go to any of the wonderful pizza parlors in Pittsburgh.  I'm sure Toscana has an oven and it's made out of bricks, but if you want thin crust neapolitan please keep looking. You'll be happy you did.

One star for the excellent service and decor.  Minus four for the lack of basics when it comes to food quality and flavor, and for making my party feel sick from the oil and bad flavors. The proprietor seems to understand hospitality and presentation, but is in dire need of understanding the basics of quality food."}
{"text":"Was there on Sunday June 11th. Food was just ok. There were a lot of fleas in the dining area. Made our time there really annoying. Must be a cleanliness problem."}
{"text":"Always seem to have a great experience here. Nice relaxed atmosphere with patio seating. Waitstaff has been extremely friendly and helpful. Love their Gorgonzola Pizza. Appetizers are good and decent wine selection to accompany any meal. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Three of us went to lunch on a weekday and waited an hour for pasta and a salad. Our waters were never refilled, and the food came out lukewarm/cold. While the food tasted good, the slowness and lack of attention was grating and made for a lackluster meal."}
{"text":"My family and I were pleasantly surprised! We're Italian and hard to impress, but we all agreed the pizzas were pretty good. I can't vouch for the pasta, though, as we were all in a pizza mood.  The place had a nice atmosphere, but was pretty empty for a Tuesday night dinner; I'm assuming the word hasn't gotten out yet.  Our only qualm was that the pizzas were pretty tiny for $12-16.  They're 10\" cut into 8 slices, which isn't enough for even 2 people.  Overall, a positive review!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Good range on the beer and wine selection and a decent happy hour. Defiantly sit at or near the bar with Melissa. She was AMAZING. Perfect balance of friendly and unobtrusive, and never left you in need of anything."}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant I was immediately greeted and seated. Very pleasant. The mood of the place is very warm and welcoming. Classy. The server was absolutely phenomenal. The way he described the menu was like poetry, his voice was so professional and pleasing to listen to. I finally decided on the pistachio salmon and was very surprised at how quickly it arrived! Not to mention how absolutely delicious it was! The server made sure to keep my raspberry tea coming! Dessert?! Yes! Breath taking! Strawberry watermelon cobbler! Amazing food! Stupendous service! WHEN you go, see if the tall handsome bearded gentleman is working! I want to say his name is Tony?"}
{"text":"Upscale and happy to accommodate vegetarian patrons by whipping something off the menu. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Our dinner last night was pretty good.  This restaurant is in an upscale mixed corporate / residential complex about 15 minutes from the Tanger Outlets (where we spent the day).  We walked in around 7:30 and were fortunate to be seated right away on a Friday night.

To start, we shared the bruschetta appetizer which had more diced tomatoes (my favorite) than I've ever seen.

The kids shared a pepperoni pizza from the adult menu (it actually wasn't on the menu but the server offered it).  They devoured it.

Our appetizers included the pistachio salmon and a chicken over linguine.  There was a bit more discussion with the server about swapping my wife's pasta side for vegetables than we thought necessary, but it worked out as she enjoyed spinach.  The chicken linquine dish was plenty for me as I couldn't finish all the pasta.  We had adult drinks (2 draft beers and a Tito rocks) and two kids drinks. We also had and an additional side of arugula as well.

Splurging on dessert - the creme brulee with fresh strawrberries was good too.

This meal was $101 plus tip. Overall, this was a really enjoyable evening with good food in a nice atmosphere. The staff was friendly and attentive and the other patrons seemed to be enjoying themselves as well.

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My first visit to this chain may possibly be my last. Although the fare was good, the venue was intolerable as this is the noisiest restaurant I have ever been in. I couldn't hear myself think!  Nothing but hard surfaces and a clientele which competed to see who could talk loudest. Thumbs down. One star for the pasta."}
{"text":"Not an enjoyable experience. They were out of their advertised special but failed to tell us that until after we ordered. Our waitress was unresponsive and we never saw her again after our food came...our table and one other table were the only ones in the restaurant!  Everything from the fire was burned and the food was just OK. There are many other delicious choices in Southpointe. Sad that we wasted our money at this place."}
{"text":"I visited Toscana for the first time with my parents for dinner after hearing many good things about the restaurant since they had visited on multiple previous occasions. 

We had a reservation but it was a calm evening so it probably was not necessey. We were greeted and seated immediately and we had very good service the whole evening. First, we were given fresh sourdough bread and an herbed dipping oil to enjoy as we waited for our meals. I ordered the salmon salad and they both ordered shrimp with basil linguine. Apparently this is their favorite dish. My mother prefers it without anchovies, but my dad likes the anchovies which a cut up very finely and really just add a bit of extra depth to the flavor. I really enjoyed my salmon salad. The salmon was cooked very nicely and all the veg was fresh and tasty. Also, the dressing was fantastic - very flavorful. We had a dessert coupon, so we split a dessert. They seem to rotate dessert offerings, but anyways we selected the strawberry cheesecake with chocolate covered strawberries. I wasn't a big fan of the cheesecake, the textures were just ok, but the chocolate covered strawberries with excellent. I really can't complain about free dessert, that was nice!

I would definitely come back. It's pricey and South Pointe is far from my home, so it will probably stay a special occasion type of place for me. Lunches are more affordable so employees of the local businesses could definitely enjoy a great lunch here."}
{"text":"I loved it! Came here with my girlfriend before going to a concert. We had some drinks, salad and shared some flat breads. Everything was so fresh and tasted amazing. Will deff return soon. Told my husband he has to try it with me next time lol"}
{"text":"Truly a great experience! I have been in the area for almost 2 weeks now for work and have come to Toscana Brick Oven about 6 times, I have yet to be disappointed! Great atmosphere, staff, and more importantly GREAT food! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Zucchini straw and stuffed hot banana pepper appetizers very good. Entree linguini with shrimp spinach,tomatoes w/garlic olive oil a little on the dry side. Linguini with bolognese very good. Service was pleasant. Ate at the bar. Matt and Rick bartender/servers were great. Would definitely come back again to try the pizzas"}
{"text":"Very lively bar area for young professionals. The restaurant has a nice upscale feel to it. The food is interesting, but not exotic. There were so many great appetizers on the menu that I got 3, and that was my dinner. My wife's Marsala was fabulous. I strongly recommend this place. The wait staff was also very attentive. Friendly, but not overly familiar."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Lunch is also great. Dinner is a little pricey.
Customer service is top notice, especially the manager, L***.
I will certainly be back.
Love the free bread and oil. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I made reservations for myself and 17 guest, for my birthday last night. Everybody enjoyed the atmosphere, drink selection and their dinners. Absolutely no complaints, everything was perfect. The food is amazing! They gave us a cozy private room and had a gift table set-up as well.

The staff went above and beyond
making sure that myself and my
guests had a great time. Fantastic service. This is the second dinner party we did here. The first was for my husband's birthday in August and again they did a fantastic job. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pizzas are pricey but good. The mushroom pizza is really good. 

They have a good happy hour that we have been to a couple times.

I haven't had any wine here but they seem to have. A big selection.

Lots of outside seating, providing the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I don't write many 'bad' reviews.  But, my experience wasn't very good. The staff was unfamiliar with what a vegan diet is. When I explained they continue to offer options that were not vegan. I settled on a simple salad. Which was just ok. I love eating at Italian restaurants and usually find a lot of options and that they are willing to work with me. Unfortunately, my list doesn't include this place. In the end they also charged me for items I didn't get, so double check your bill if you eat here."}
{"text":"The most WONDERFUL meat balls I ever tasted.
The spaghetti looks small but was very filling with the 3 delicious meatballs plus bread.
I would like to order some meatballs through their catering service.
Nice environment but had to sit next to some cocky local salesman who wanted to drink and rant about local politics."}
{"text":"The meatballs were good but they were cold inside they should have been hot!!! The bread with oil was delicious. pizza was good.  zucchini fries were terrible couldn't taste zucchini tasted like grease. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times and find the food to be very good and consistent.  The apps are very good and make it hard to pick an entree.  The service has always been very attentive.  Last night I had the meatballs which were excellent and my wife had the lobster ravioli."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great surprise! Few places have we loved everything we ordered and the service was outstanding as well.  Fungi pizza with tomatoes added and the Toscano meatballs with linguini - awsome! This was our first time and we'll certainly be back to try the other unique items on the menu."}
{"text":"I work in the noble energy building on the other side of the resturant. I went on my lunch hour with a coworker. We came in the side door to the patio there was no note advising to not enter this way. 2 waiters walked past us 4 times just looking at us. Finally one of the waitresses said the hostess was over there. Her outfit for work looked like she just came from the gym. The food is pretty decent, prices are ridiculous for lunch. I wont be back wasn't impressed with anything. I gave it 2 stars for being within walking distance to where I work which was convenient."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here weekly. I order either the salmon or the caesar salad. The lettuce is always fresh and the salmon is cooked the way I order. Their dressings are delicious, and the crispy onion strips on the salmon salad add a really nice crunch. Even though they are a bit pricey, the portion sizes and quality makes them worth it!"}
{"text":"I came here with a husband and a friend for dinner on a Friday night. I ordered the margarita pizza and a beer. The pizza was good, you could tell the ingredients were high quality. 

My husband ordered peanut butter pie for dessert and it was awesome. Probably my favorite part. 

They also had a promo going where since we spent over $100 (all of us on one bill), we got a free $25 gift card. I thought that was pretty cool. 

I do think the prices were a little high for what you get. But other than that a good experience. I would return."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 5 people on a Friday night in November.  Here's what we experienced:
--The table was squeezed into a narrow dining area next to the bar. It was loud and a breeze blew through whenever the entry door to the restaurant opened.  When I asked the waiter if we could move, he said very curtly that there were no other tables, even as  I viewed several open tables farther from the door.  
--From ordering to serving, it took about 50 minutes.  When we inquired about our meals at after 40 minutes, the waiter explained that the pizza was taking a while.  Pizza shouldn't take that long.
--The chicken dish with a lemon cream sauce was more butter than cream.  It was similar to an Alfredo and definitely not worth an entree price. 

Neither myself or my friends plan on going back.  The older, established Italian restaurants in the Pittsburgh area give you a better meal for your dollar."}
{"text":"Disgusting, they brought my sandwich to our table and it was nasty looking and not appealing at all. It was obvious I did not touch the thing. Two different people came to the table asking if I wanted anything different. All I wanted was it removed from in front of me because it was making me noxious. I asked for the check and paid it and left tip. I could not believe they charged me for that item. That is what I get for being nice saying it was not appealing for me rather than being honest that it looked disgusting. Oh well, they will not be able to try again with me because I will not be going back and will not have anything nice to say about this place. Other than my three colleagues seemed to like their pizza."}
{"text":"Bartender was great, she was very attentive and friendly. Wedding soup was disappointing, salty with 1 meatball and a couple pieces of chicken. Gnocchi was good with tasty sausage and a zesty sauce. Friend enjoyed the gorgonzola flat bread. Prices a bit high for what you get."}
{"text":"I thought that the food was very good. I am a vegetarian and while there weren't a large number of options for vegetarians on the menu, they were very accommodating and I made a custom pasta with no meat. I'll definitely come again."}
{"text":"If you have lived in Europe , you know what I mean when I say that most pizzerias in in US suck...
I landed at this place for a business lunch and saw their pizza served to a guest. Looking at that pizza itself I knew I was coming back here to try it. Didn't know that I'll end up landing up for dinner itself . Ordered Verdura and so glad to have ordered it. Perfectly baked base and roasted big chunks of veggies . Loving it. Their standard bread they serve before the meal is SUPER AWESOME. I am going to be a regular here ..."}
{"text":"New restaurant in Southpointe that will be a big hit. The fresh made pasta was fantastic. The server Maria was very good. Tricolore appetizer was also fabulous.

The owner was there and is a very sharp, friendly guy who has another hit on his hands."}
{"text":"Food was great but small portion and pretty pricey. Feels like an upscale/corporate environment. Our server was very nice and did a good job."}
{"text":"So my son took me here and it is a winner. They have a full menu packed with dishes that are diverse and look great. I was steered to some of the more classic dishes. Spaghetti and meatballs and beef bolognese. Since the others were getting the meatballs I went bolognese. While we waited the bread and salads came and I was impressed. Nothing too fancy just really good bread and a nice fresh salad. Okay, and a couple berry mojitos that I would recommend. Food arrived and I was so happy I went classic. This was probably one of the best I've ever had. Hearty flavorful sauce,  perfectly cooked pasta... heavenly. The meatballs come with a Alfredo sauce on the pasta and a red sauce on three big balls. I got to try one and wow that is a really really well done meatball. As the dish is earn the sauces combine and make a third sauce they they said keeps them coming back. Well done!! We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm going to be short and to the point with this one. 
   The location was out of my neck of the woods. However, when I arrived I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is on the corner of a little plaza with other bars and little shops. Nice place across from consol. I'm sure the location is still up and coming because it wasn't extremely busy. 
   It took maybe 3-4 minutes for the host to seat us, not sure why. The server was professional and helpful with questions I had on various items on the menu. We ordered the bruschetta to start. I ended up going for the Salted Caramel Apple martini and the Smoked Formaggio Blu pizza. My date went for the Chianti and pistachio salmon. 
   The Martini was very good. It has a perfect blend of all, the salt, caramel drizzle on the rim and the beauty of the martini. It was not strong but still had the martini effect! The Pizza wasn't huge. Maybe the size of a dinner plate. It had a good amount of prosciutto, artichokes and pistachios. I'm not a huge fan of Blu cheese, but it was tastes with the pizza toppings. I ordered a side of marinara for dipping.
    The salmon was served with an herbed linguine. The salmon was a decent size and was drizzled with a balsamic glaze, which my date ordered more of. The food was served on such a big plate that it did not look like there was a lot, but it ended up being very filling.
    The bruschetta was served on three slices of bread, ended up being just a wee bit tough, with the diced tomatoes, a little chunk of mozzarella on each piece and drizzled with their awesome balsamic glaze. Over all, it was good. The calamari is supposed to be very good from what I hear.
    For a price range for  just myself:
2 drinks, half of the app, and the pizza including tip came to a little over $40....
Not really short and to the point, but I try:)"}
{"text":"Both my husband and I enjoyed our dishes.  I had the pappardelle and he had a veal pasta dish.  If you are looking for a good pasta dish, this place is a good option.  I have to say though, it was pricey.  We paid $40 for two pasta dishes without a salad and no alcohol."}
{"text":"The food was average at best. I am a manager in food service and the customer service is non existant. We have been waiting for at least 40 minute to get our bill and we cannot even find our server or a manager. No one has done a check back on us. I will  not retun."}
{"text":"Good solid Italian fair.    Pizza and the bolognese pasta is what I get in a regular basis"}
{"text":"Always love coming here. Can never go wrong with one of their pizzas. Loaded with toppings and thin bubbly crust. I normally just get one of the pastas but decided on veal. Had an interesting taste but still not bad. We also had the salmon. That was the only meal that disappoint. It was a little fishy. I will be sticking to pizza/pasta from now on."}
{"text":"My most recent visit here was dining in.  This is the first time I dined in for dinner.  

My friend and I walked in and the restaurant was really slow,  I have always dined in for lunch and it's usually hopping.  We were not seated immediately,  in fact to our surprise we had to wait at the podium for a little while to be seated.  Once we were seated it took awhile for our server to greet us at our table,  we were perplexed,  again because the restaurant was slow.  When she finally came back we we ordered drinks and she took our appetizer order.  We then waited,  and waited...  When she returned she brought our appetizers and then took our order.  We were there for so long and I would have understood if it were busy,  but it wasn't.  

We ordered the meatball Appetizer,  I thought it was good,  my friend said it was average.  We both agreed that the marinara sauce was delicious.  We also had the fried Zucchini straws and I was really disappointed,  they were very greasy and the horseradish sauce that accompanied was good,  but very strong and took over the flavor of the dish.  We both ordered the Lobster and Crab pasta,  it was amazing.  It was pricey,  but it was really delicious and I would order it again.  We would have ordered dessert,  but were never asked.  I probably would have given another four star review,  but the service was not very good."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here twice now. Both times were a great disappointment. First time I ordered pizza it was burnt so badly I couldnt eat it. 
The second time I ordered the meatballs and pasta. The sauce is so bland it makes store bought taste great ! 
Please do yourself a huge favor and try one of the many other restaurants in town. You will thank me later."}
{"text":"I was meeting some friends for dinner and one of them said they wanted to try Toscana. It was a beautiful night out so we decided to dine outside. It was a beautiful evening and we were excited to try a new place. 
I ordered the wedding soup to start. It took awhile for it to come but I was very pleased with it. It was wedding soup but the flavor took it to another level. There were small meatballs, bits of chicken, tiny pasta, spinach and a few other things. It was hearty. 
I shared the Beans and Greens appetizer with friends. It had white beans and greens and they were delicious. There was a bit of heat which added even more to the dish. Once we were eating it there was not one bean or green left. 
For my entree I ordered the Meatball dish served with herbed pasta. It's one of the dishes they are known for. When it was served it was 3 huge meatballs with a small nest of pasta in the center. The meatballs were some of the best I have ever had. They are house made and I would love to know the ingredients. The meatballs had a lot of flavor melded together. I didn't have much expectation for the pasta but I was completely surprised. It was fresh made with a very light Alfredo type sauce with fresh herbs on top. There were several layers of flavor. They were delicious by themselves. I could have had just the pasta and I would have been happy.  
The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the service wasn't up to par. Our server was nice but there would be long periods of time between check ins. 
We will definitely go back to try more dishes. One of my friends got Chicken Marsala and raved about how good it was. One of my other friends had a veal dish and she couldn't say enough about how much she enjoyed it. It ALL looked fabulous."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Excellent choices on menu! High recommend the crab cakes and pasta dishes all great!"}
{"text":"Our server was a bit of a stick in the mud, but the food more than made up for his disposition. 

The pizza crusts were really good and the tortellini pasta we had was excellent, even with chunks of diced carrot in the sauce, which normally turns me off.

They had an okay beer selection and the kids dinners were fairly priced and plentiful."}
{"text":"Likely never return here again. Overall, the prices are too high for the mediocre food and somehow we got stiffed by the waitress who decided not to bring us bread before our meal. We arrived on father's day without a reservation for two people and were seated immediately by the host who looked like he'd rather be anywhere but there. Our waitress arrived to ask for our drink specials and proceeded to tell us that the only one they had for that day was from the previous day! What? Do restaurants really serve specials from a day prior? Unbelievable. We decided to go with the Pollo Entree and the Veal Carbonara pasta. The pollo was very well done, dry, and the linguine accompanying it was very salty, but lacking the lemon cream sauce taste that I had read on the menu. It was cooked to a perfect al dente though. My husband's veal dish was good, according to him. He did mention the pasta being very oily though. The portions were both were average to small size.  Since it was Father's Day we went with dessert which we rarely do. It was a pretty tasty bread pudding with a cinnamon ice cream.  Overall the meal was below average and even with a 10% military discount I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Toscana and both times my husband and I had very good meals. It was a lovely Sunday evening and we decided to sit outside. The patio area is very nice with two water fountains which makes for a very relaxing atmosphere. My husband started off with the beans and greens and throughly enjoyed them, I started with the wedding soup and found it delicious. Hubby ordered the Carbonara Pasta dish that is made with veal, caramelized onions , bacon and peas. Very tasty. I had a Margarita Pizza that was also very good. The portions at Toscana are not overly large but the ingredients are of a high quality. Our server was attentive checking back several times to make sure we were OK. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our favorite date night restaurant. Rick and Cameron always take fantastic care of us and make us feel special, and the food is always great."}
{"text":"Great experience with their early happy hour specials. Try the bruschetta or calamari appetizers."}
{"text":"We were in a booth with the sun coming in blinding me.  The lower windows have blinds but not the top window....so no sun protection...get blinds for Pete's sake! 

Our waiter was also handling the bar so he was busy once people came in and sat at the bar.  Service was OK.  It did take a little longer than I would expect to get our meal after we ordered but we were not in a hurry and were there to dine.  
Had a salad that was fresh and really good.  Ordered the short rib ravioli that came in a red sauce.  The ravioli was good and the red sauce was good too.  Since everyone has there idea of what red sauce should taste like, I found this to be good.  One person in our group had a pasta with the sausage and felt the same as I did on my previous visit...find a different sausage supplier!"}
{"text":"My family ate here last night (NYE). My fiancé ordered the Pollo, and my mom ordered the Chicken Marsala. They have both been violently ill and vomiting all night. I ordered the pumpkin ravioli, so luckily I feel fine. It seems that the chicken was likely contaminated. I understand that things like this can happen sometimes, but when you are spending $100 for dinner you expect a higher quality of food preparation. I am so disappointed because we all thought the food was delicious. Our waiter was also excellent. However, being sick all night was definitely not worth it for us. This was our first time at this restaurant, and unfortunately will be the last. I am sad and angry that the my family members are spending New Year's Day feeling sick due to this kitchen's negligence."}
{"text":"It's right down the street from my sons condo in Southpointe and its an upscale restaurant with a really nice dining room and bar. They have a patio so you can eat your pizza and drink during the one month of sunshine in PA. The service is excellent and the place is clean. There know for there pizza which is wood fired and really good but it will set you back about $20.00 a person for a pizza and drink."}
{"text":"I work in the area and have ordered lunch from Toscana twice and have been disappointed both times.  If you plan on ordering salad for lunch, don't expect it to be filling.  The ingredients mostly consist of just lettuce.  Very little of anything else advertised goes into the salad.  Had the Margarita pizza once and it lacked flavor.  For the money they charge for lunch, I would expect the salads to be more filling.  I won't be buying lunch from them anymore.  You get more for your money at Zoup."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant on a Friday after work. Good food, decent beer and wine menu, and food that while nothing overly special certainly was very tasty. 

We started with bruschetta, served warm with mozzarella, tomatoes, onion, garlic and balsamic over three pieces of crusty buttered bread. I liked this a lot, and could have kept eating. But dinner was coming. 

My wife had the bolognese, which was very good. A nice tomato and meat sauce over extra wide noodles. 

I had chicken Marsala with herbed pasta. Tasty, and a very good size (I didn't finish it all). I would have preferred a more potent kick of Marsala flavor. The noodles were buttery and had a lot of garlic. Nothing wrong there.

Staff was very attentive. Outdoor seating looked wonderful with fountains and sunny views. Inside, the modern decor and high ceiling meant it was a bit on the loud side, but it was happy hour and I didn't mind. 

Next time (yes, I'll be back) I need to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Visiting here for business. Went here for lunch. No impressed. Service was very slow and way too expensive. We each had a side salad and a pizza, which were told was a small pizza. Bill was over $60. They even charged for an extra very small cup of salad dressing!!  Pizza wasn't bad but not with the price"}
{"text":"Had an early dinner after being out all day and before we checked in at our hotel in south point.

We had the zucchini fries appetizer which were great being very lightly battered and served with an excellent horseradish dipping sauce, a chicken and pasta dish and a meat Ragu as well. 

The flavors and quality of the food was excellent with the portion size being on the medium to small size so the value was just ok. 

Not the best Italian but far from the worst we've ever had for sure and if you're in this area staying at one of the hotels, it is an extremely convenient place to have a nice meal. Just be prepared to spend $40+ per person with tip if you have an appetizer and any drinks."}
{"text":"Was here when I was at southpointe for a meeting. I ordered a chicken salad. The chicken was not my favorite. It is dry and not seasoned well. I liked the dressing and the greens tasted fresh and crispy. 

They also served bread with olive oil and some seasoning that I don't know since I didn't eat it. For a group of six people, it wasn't easy to stretch and get the bread from a single plate that is at the center of the table; especially in a formal meeting set up."}
