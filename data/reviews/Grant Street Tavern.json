{"text":"Best bar Downtown!  Bar none.  Real. Genuine {sorry for redundancy}.  Best bartendress's and best inner city bar.  Don't bar me from this wonderful bar."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang after work. Lots of Pittsburgh whose who goes here. Drinks are nice, stiff and cheap. Be sure to get you some window meat before leaving. Some of the best sandwiches that you will probably ever have in the burgh! They always have the popcorn and chips on deck! Indulge!   It's not the best place for large parties, but if you have a good table of 6, to check out a place that's not too loud and centrally located, check out GST."}
{"text":"I'm a long time Nicky's customer, but after enduring the wrath of one specific waitress over the last 2 years or so, I won't be returning.  They've lost a couple waitresses recently and the service has gone WAY downhill.  You'd think that after being a customer for so long I'd get better service knowing that they'll be seeing me again, but no.  This one waitress is just so terrible, I've complained about her before and she's never changed.  Today was the last straw. She wasn't our waitress (though the service was not good, even a little strange), but my friend was returning to the table to leave a tip and crossed her path by accident. The bad waitress made a comment to her about how 'that wasn't going to work', meaning that she had walked in front of her.  Who does that?  Who talks to customers that they see all of the time like that?  My friend didn't even see her coming and one of the bus boys even commented!  The food isn't that great for me to have to endure her everytime, so I won't be returning after today."}
{"text":"A former coworker wanted to meet up for lunch and he decided on here. Ive worked downtown for 4 years and I've never even heard of this spot. It was exciting to finally hit up a new place for lunch!   This diner reminded me of Tic Toc cafe in Macys (only better food and better service). There are booths, tables and even a counter to dine at. They also offer takeout. Its your basic soup, sandwiches, salads & wraps.They had a pretty decent menu and even offered some daily specials. Our server was very kind and took good care of us.  My dining partner went with the special which was a turkey club on croisant/ It came with a side of chips and a side of fruit. I went with a turkey club wrap and added and order of fries. Everything in my wrap tasted fresh and i also enjoyed the steak-cut fries. The wrap was grilled and I enjoyed it.  Sadly i will no longer be working downtown after Friday. I'm upset that I just found out about this place. If you're like me and looking for a new place to grab something, stop here. Its nothing fancy but hey its a diner downtown. It's better than eating at Chipotle 4x a week. lol"}
{"text":"I love, love, love Grant St Tavern! It's my favorite downtown bar. Women-owned and operated, the owner and staff here are amazing - my friends and I come here for drinks after work, and have thrown multiple fundraisers and parties here. Prices and pours are good, and there's free popcorn and snacks in the evening (cannot order food after lunch).   The space is a bit small for large groups to show up unannounced, but Cheryl will work with you in advance to reserve space and prep food needed for your party.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"Nicky's is your classic diner.  I was in the court house area today (no worries, wasn't in court) and walked into the Grant Building with the intent on giving the Grant Street Tavern a try for lunch when I noticed this place.  It looked pretty popular so I decided to give it a try instead.   My waitress, Marlene, greeted me almost immediately by asking me what I'd like to have. I appreciate the attention much more than waiting so I replied as politely as I could \"Can I start with a menu please?\" After looking over the menu I decided a burger was probably the safest thing to order when in a deli. Despite the place being relatively busy, the waitress took my order within a minute of my setting down the menu and five minutes later, I had a Mushroom Provolone Burger in front of me.    I wasn't really expecting much and was pretty impressed with what I got for $6.69 (tax included). The bun and the tomato was fresh, the mushrooms were plentiful and a nice melted slice of provolone covered a burger that you could tell was hand pressed (not a frozen patty). It was cooked all the way through while still maintaining a juicy bite.   I give it a four star for quick service, good value for your dollar and a burger that exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"If you enjoy more franchise based diner like eateries you probably really enjoy Eat N Park or Dennys. This is more than fine, in fact this is the only downtown equivalent to such a place. Unfortunately Nicky's is a little pricier than you typical diner. More importantly in the few times I have been, the service has been slower than a drop of molasses falling down a Vermont Birchwood in the middle of winter. (I have no idea what that means)  All in all if you find yourself downtown in a withdrawal like state for basic diner food and you fear you may die unless given your typical diner dose then I guess Nicky's is right up your alley."}
