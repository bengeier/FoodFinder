{"text":"I was expecting this restaurant to be a lot better than it was. My husband and I went there for lunch during the week with high hopes. For starters, the waiter was unbelievably annoying and rude which ruined our whole experience. We ordered the 3 platter dip which was good (nothing special), the grilled octopus (which was dense and not good at all) and a Greek salad (which was also nothing special. Could have made the same one if not better at home). Overall, I would say the bill was not worth the food, service or experience."}
{"text":"Horrific service. I have a food allergy and am used to going out and working with the restaurant on wheat I can eat.  I accept the options may be limited, I'm used to it, no big deal.   We were ordering appetizers and told the waiter what my issues were.  He didn't know what was in the food. He begrudgingly checked with the kitchen, came back and said they brought their food in and the ingredients weren't on the packaging. He couldn't guarantee what was in it, he wasn't a scientist.  He was defensive and argumentative.   We asked to speak to the manager. We could actually hear the waiter going on to the manager about us. The manager couldn't of cared less, he couldn't guarantee anything, it's up to me if I wanted to risk it and suggested I eat a dry salad.  After asking about a couple of options, we weren't getting anywhere, paid for our wine and left. Extremely disappointing service with no knowledge of their food.   Went down the street to Hush, had fantastic service, they knew their menu!"}
{"text":"After seeing the Matinee performance of the Phantom of the Opera, me and my husband decided to have an early dinner at Penelope Greek Restaurant. We had dined there many years ago when we were first dating and we had a very pleasant time eating there.  This time was was just as special. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very warm and inviting, especially after walking outside in the cold from the theatre. It was also nice that it wasn't very busy, since the dinner crowd had not started yet. We were seated at a very nice table by the window which had a perfect view of the Princess of Wales theatre in the foreground in which we saw the Phantom of the Opera.    We had some delicious whole wheat bread with butter. The bread was like nothing I ever tasted before, it was light and warm and it almost melted in my mouth. We ordered our food which arrived very quickly. I had the beef tenderloin souvlaki dinner which was cooked perfectly (medium). The beef tenderloin pieces were seasoned perfectly and tasted so good. The potatoes had a very nice lemony taste and the rice was also very good.  What I liked about the rice is that they didn't give me such a huge portion like other chain Greek restaurants, that make you feel too full. The vegetables were also very good too. Needless to say, I finished everything on my plate.    My husband had the kalamari and he also had the same sides as my dish had. (Rice, potatoes, vegetables). He said that the Kalamari was cooked perfectly and it was very tender.    We would definitely eat at Penelope again!! I would highly recommend it to anyone.  The restaurant is very elegant and decorated in that upscale downtown Toronto flair. The waiters who served us were also very polite and frequently filled our water glasses. Dinner at Penelope made our special day out even more special as we ended the evening."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner recently and the food was ok, but the service definitely needs improvement.  We were provided with bread and butter to start while we pick from the menu which was a good start. However, it was unfortunate that it just went downhill from there. We order couple bottles of wine and when the server brought it over, he just pushed me to one side to pour the drinks. I understand that it was hard to serve at a long table, but really the last thing you should really do is to be pushing your customers aside to a point where my chair shifted right next to the person beside me. This happened after on several occasions and I was not impressed. I even made a statement saying that I was being pushed again, but the server took no concern for it.   The food was ok, the portions were pretty generous and most entrees came with a side of salad, rice and potatoes. I had the Penelope Salad and while there was a lot of greens, it wasn't worth the price listed (See photo). The best dish for me personally was the appetizer which was the baked cheese. They torched it in front of our table too which was an eye opener. But other than that I would say it's a miss."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant,  and I think it's renewed! I recommend Saganagi and Ram chops!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is simply not good and they do not make any efforts to make it better. All dishes contain the same sides (i.e. potatoes, rice and veggies) and you may be surprised that the staff acknowledged that the veggies are frozen vegetables bought from the store without feeling bad about it.   They unfortunately do not care about the quality of their food and resort to the strategy of making money from one off customers that are in the area for other entertainment. Their nicely decorated restaurant and overpriced dishes are unfortunately extremely deceptive."}
{"text":"Had dinner before a show. The food was great. I had the grilled calamari. The squid was grilled to perfection.  Service was excellent. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Been here many times on my frequent visits to Toronto (my favorite second city).  The first time I was here was around 2004, and had the Grilled Lamb Chops.....best I ever had.  Myself and an ex closed the place with the owner and staff, sitting and chatting and drinking more wine.  For that alone, I give it five stars.  I fell in love with this place, and actually planned a trip on a whim just  to have those Grilled Lamb Chops, got in the car and started driving (10 hours).  Worth the trip, as Toronto itself is always worth the trip.  If you go, be sure to check out Bloor St.  It is miles and miles of great restaurants---small, ethnic mom and pops, one better than the other.  But, Penolope on King St. should be your first stop. Have the Grilled Lamb Chops."}
{"text":"Went here prior to a Roy Thompson concert. It is very busy and one does tend to feel a little rushed because of that. Special was a Veal Rib which was very tasty but had a lot of meat on it so one had to very hungry. Because I love Greektown, I guess I have become very picky about Greek places away from the Danforth, so would rate this as just okay Service is very friendly. Has a small bar area, if one just wants to have a drink before a show or concert."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day with my hunny. He had the lamb and I had moussaka. My moussaka was okay.. Nothing too impressive and not much better than Jimmy the Greek. My boyfriend's lamb was very tender and quite good. The setting was nice and classy, as it was a white tablecloth sort of restaurant. It's an alright place, but I probably wouldn't go back just because it didn't really wow me."}
{"text":"I was lured here by an extremely high review score on Google, but I obviously should have checked yelp as well. This place is mediocre at best - not Toronto fine dining.   The menu is extremely basic, which would be okay if that meant excellent preparation and presentation.  In this case, it meant soaked with oil.  Nothing was bad, but nothing stood out as good either.   Penelope would have garnered at least 3 stars from me if the service had been decent, but it was easily some of the worst service I've seen. Slow to take orders, refused to make a cocktail, got an entree wrong, and absolutely no personality."}
{"text":"Their food is decent, but it seems that the owners & staff haven't changed their formula in ages. The food is basic Greek (steamed rice and vegetables on the side) that is good, but dated. Our group was the only guests in the restaurant on a Saturday night and we didn't even get enough attention! In fact, nobody ordered dessert because the server didn't bother to return to ask if we had made our choices. Generally, the staff seems like they have mentally checked out..."}
{"text":"Good greek for what you find in the area  Had the chicken and pork souvlaki for lunch and food came in less than 10 mins  Meat was tender, very seasoned The potatoes were even cooked a bit in vinegar giving it a great taste!  Bread served before meal was freshly cooked and warm  Def. more of a sit down restaurant place and prices are a bit higher than most lunch meals but feel very satisfied."}
{"text":"We only sampled a few small plates but they were good. The staff was helpful but their beer selection is lacking.  We sat on the patio and it was okay but they need to invest in some plants for their planters. Just having the old dead plants really does not help the ambiance of a concrete patio."}
{"text":"Very mediocre and bland food, high prices. The restaurant was empty when we came there for dinner last week. After tasting the food, I realized why it was empty. Not worth the price, definitely. The two waiters who served our table were loitering around all the time, which was kind of annoying. I am not sure if they were trying to eavesdrop or something, but it made us feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"If your looking for a reasonably priced greek meal in the core this is a good choice. The decor is classic greek, service is ok, and food is ok with a reasonable number of wines on the list. They are consistent time after time. I had the roast leg which is always good. Portions are good and price is reasonable. Two including wine and tip was 70."}
{"text":"I work around the area so I've been in this restaurant a few times. I notice that their portions are less and price are higher than before. Today I had a pork tenderloin souvlaki ($20). I am a small person and I can tell you I was half full. I don't know how expensive the pork is but if you can't give me more than one skewer at least give me more than a handful of rice to fill me up!  On the other hand my friends lamp chops were like three big pieces and she can't even finish half. Everytime I go to this restaurant I have this problem! Some people always have to pack up while others are still starving. Sorry I am not paying $25 for a half full lunch when the food court gives a full meal, equal quality meal for 1/3 of the price. I am not lying just look at the pictures people post. I have never seen rice portion that small. One of the pics I can count one cheese pie (size of spring roll) and like 5 pieces of green beans, 2 pieces of potatoes and a grain of rice!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Good food and service. Be sure to as for Sophocles!"}
{"text":"As with most Greek restaurants in Toronto, the portion sizes at Penelope are quite large.   From the exterior, it may look like a fine dining option, however, the prices are on par with neighboring Greek restaurants.  I had the beef souvlaki plate ($19) which came with the typical Greek salad and side of rice. The beef was nicely cooked to a medium rare but lacked flavor.   Food arrived pretty fast considering I was on my lunch break - so at least they're reliable for getting you back to office on time!  The server was attentive but in no way friendly. I'm hoping to try more items on the menu in the future, so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We enjoy visiting this restaurant before attending a show along King Street. The service is great.  I really like the way the octopus is grilled and presented.  Typically I will have the perfectly cooked rainbow trout with just veggies but I've tried the potatoes and rice as well, both are very tasty.  They also carry one of my favourite red wines, McMannis."}
{"text":"I am 90% sure I ate here years ago one day, but maybe I dreamt it...anyway, was recently here on a gorgeous Thursday for lunch in July.  Coworkers made reservations for 12:30 and when we arrived and went in the door, the place was totally empty that I could tell.  The host greeted us after a few seconds and let us choose wherever we would like to sit on the patio, which only had two tables occupied out of at least a dozen out there.  There were six of us, so we moved a two-seater and a four-seater together for a nice spot in the shade.  Friendly, simple service.  I ordered the Spinach Cheese Pie (phyllo pastry, spinach, green onions, dill, feta cheese, olive oil. $17) which came with the traditional side of potatoes, rice & Greek salad.  Didn't blow me away, but was good and nothing wrong with it at all...fine portion size, decent flavor, etc.  The others in my group commented that the calamari and Atlantic salmon were very good.  I would definitely come back here; it's just that there are so many restaurants to choose from on King West that it probably wouldn't be one of my top choices if I had to pick.  But if someone else suggested, sure."}
{"text":"We just had a birthday dinner for a friend at Penelope's. All the good we ordered was good, with the grilled calamari being especially good.  The saganaki was good, but there was too much liquid in the pan, and so the cheese sat in a lot of liquid.   The only drawback is the staff. They seemed very flustered and rushed with the theatre crowd. The staff member who seated us was not the best welcome to the restaurant.   Overall, very tasty dinner. But staff need to be trained better in customer service."}
{"text":"We stopped for dinner on our way to a concert. This restaurant is located in the busy King St. West area. They seemed to be aware that most of the customers coming are on their way to a show or an event as they asked us if we are going somewhere after the meal and they will try to be mindful of the time restriction.   This is a Greek restaurant and unfortunately I'm not an expert of this particular cuisine so I cannot verify how authentic it is. On their menu, they have the usual Greek dishes but noticed that prices were on the high side. The waitress we had was very good and accommodating.  I went with the Roast Lamb which came with rice, steamed vegetables and potatoes. The Lamb was good and the portion was very generous. However, it lacked a bit of flavour. Side dishes were not good.   I didn't hate my experience here at Penelope and would be willing to try them again. I might go with their traditional Greek dishes like their Souvlaki for next time."}
{"text":"Great food and service , a bit on the pricey side but for the portion sizes its well worth it. After walking by for years Im glad I finally got to try it."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a nice atmosphere. I went on a Thursday night at 7pm and I didn't need to wait for a seat at all.   I ordered a saganaki for appetizer. It was a great dish where fire was lit on cheese at a frying pan. It was quite a spectacle. I will highly recommend this dish.   I ordered roast lamb for the main course. Surprisingly, the lamb was tender and it was easy to chew.  Most places, I have reservation on lamb but Penelope did it right.   Overall, I'm pleased with the food and service."}
{"text":"Maybe I was spoiled by living in a Greek neighbourhood growing up, but I found Penelope utterly forgettable. Literally. I can't remember feeling any particular way about the food, which I barely recall-- I had gotten some chicken dish? Not souvlaki? I suppose this isn't a very bad thing; I'd have remembered it if it was horrible. But sitting here now, I remember little more than 'this was sustenance.'  The decor and atmosphere are nice enough, and I'd imagine it an excellent choice if your relatives were in town or you're seeing a show nearby. It's not by far the best Greek I've ever had but-- from what little I remember-- not the worst."}
{"text":"I'm as Greek as a Greek can be. My father was born on the Peloponnese and immigrated to the US at 25 and I have grown up eating home cooked Greek food my entire life. This place reminded me of every meal my father has made and it gave me the chills to taste it. It's  is authentic as they come and it's is my favorite Greek spot in Toronto and I've had many meals on the Danforth. Oh man is it good! The avgolemono is super delicious and authentic! The lamb chops are succulent and to die for. The lemoni potatoes leave your lips puckering for days in the best way. And the service is world class. I highly recommend this place! It's in an ideal location too."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded up to 4. Had lunch here and it was a nice experience. It was spacious and we got our food quickly considering we were a large group.   I enjoyed the complimentary bread basket. The bread was soft and had sesame on the crust.  I ordered the roast lamb, and that came with a large piece of lamb shoulder, along with two potato wedges, some rice, and greek salad. The lamb was good, tender enough and added flavours were subtle. The ingredients in the greek salad seemed fresh.   I even had some lamb to take home! $21 for the lamb dish, plus tax and tip. All in all, a pretty good time."}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware!  The food items under \"vegetarian\" sections are NOT vegetarian. The potatos and rice, are cooked with chicken brooth! I suspect the item I had a few bites of, spanakotiropita, has animal oil too. Very upset to learn these when I am 1/3 into my meal and found a piece of meat under my potatos. Never again. The manager did not charge me in the end, after I explain what is a vegetarian and they should inform their customers whoever order from this section. Hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very good and I would give it a 4 stars.  I had the fried calamari entrée and it was amazing.  The portion was a little small compared to your regular Greek restaurant but the quality was definitely up there.  The server didn't even greet or smiled at us and the reason for the 3-stars is because the server never came to check up on us once he took our orders.  Somebody else brought out our foods and dropped it on our table and there was no more exchange of words until we waved him down for our bill.  I would like to visit here again in the near future in hopes of a better dining experience because the food was very delicious but there is definitely room for service improvements."}
{"text":"Okay Greek food but terrible service. I ordered the filled calamari on Greek salad. The food came fast and the portions are huge - definitely good value for the food. However the servers are messy when serving and when they were clearing the tables, they were dropping the used utensils and one fell and hit my back which in turn stained my outfit. The server didn't acknowledge that it hit me, he just picked it up and brought it back to the kitchen.   Also, the servers seem like they are in a rush. Once they serve you, they are constantly trying to get you to leave. Shortly after I got my meal, my server came back multiple times to try to clear the table despite the fact that my plate was more than 1/2 full and that I was still eating.   I would rate this place a 3 only because of the food. If it was based on service, i would give them a 1."}
{"text":"I work downtown and sometimes I have them cravings for Greek food and Penelope's is where I like to frequent.   Service is always excellent. Tonight I was with a galpal. We started with some white Greek wine - fabulous. If you've never tried Greek wine, you should. Santorini wine is light and playful on the palate.  We had the hot combination platter. It was good but the one sausage on the plate did nothing for me. The calamari is fantastic. Crispy and not oily. Drench it in tobasco sauce and then tzatziki sauce!   Of course we ordered the Greek salad. It is one of the best Greek salads you will have, I promise. And lemon potatoes. That's my drug. Also, extra tzatziki sauce on the side!  OPA!!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this restaurant in almost 10 years and it looks so different!  The atmosphere is now open and bright and airy. The saganaki on pita bread was delicious!  I had the stuffed grape leaves with the Greek salad and potatoes - large servings. Service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day with my former boss. Service is good and they try their best to serve you within one hour which is great. It is very bright and airy in the restaurant making it a comfortable atmosphere. Large space with lots of seating available.  Ordered the chicken souvlaki ($18) which came at a good portion. It was quite tasty. The souvlaki came with a side of rice and greek salad that were fine as well. Nothing too special but notches higher than food court Greek. Just a tad expensive for lunch as eating only an entree was around $25 after everything.  Would recommend as a good sit down option for a lunch meeting or relaxing dinner after hitting up the theatres nearby."}
{"text":"Caution - Do Not Go To This Restaurant!!! Went to Penelope's for dinner with my family many years back. The waiter added an extra 1000 onto the bill when charging the card. We only noticed months later when we were going through our statements. We contacted the restaurant and they refused to refund our money and just stole $1000 from us. We weren't able to get it back from our credit card company, because too much time had passed. The restaurant knew they overcharged us and that they got away with it. Horrible way to treat customers and we used to go there quite a bit."}
{"text":"The atmosphere on a Toronto summer night was Super! The portions were plentiful and delicious. I had the roasted lamb, with green beans, rice pilaf and potatoes. the reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the rude or not very pleasant waiters and the food while delicious made me feel gassy."}
{"text":"I was happy and impressed with my dining experiences at Penelope.   First I had the Saganaki. It has been 2 years since I had a Saganaki plate, and not all Greke restaurants do it. Penelope did an excellent job with there Saganaki plate. The Saganaki was delicious and full of flavor like it should be. A hint of fresh squeezed Lemon is the secret ingredient.   Next I tried the Greek Salad. The Greek Salad was ok, but lacked viengar on the dressing. It didn't taste much like a Greek Salad at all. It could become one, but the dressing needs more vinegar. Greek Salad have a bite to them, this one did not, still ..... I can't give this place 4 stars. Too many positives.    For the final course, I had the Chicken Soulvaki. The plate was delicious. Chicken was grilled to perfection with the authentic tzakiki sauce [ sorry if I spelled that wrong ] rice and fresh grilled veggies followed.   You guys are spoiled in Canada with all that great food. Our food sucks the big one compared to yours ... this is definitely a 5 star place."}
{"text":"I tend to avoid restaurants in the theater district.  My experience in the past is that they're overpriced and geared toward tourists and theater goers who don't want to dine too far away from that evening's entertainment.  So I tried Penelope's with some trepidation.  I was happily surprised when it turned out to be wonderful.  Really good atmosphere--lively without being eardrum bursting.  The food was excellent.  Chicken souvlaki, calamari and moussaka.  All very good.  I've found a number of Greek places on the Danforth to be disappointing.  Small portions and dry, tasteless food.  So that's why I was so surprised that Penelope's turned out so well.  And the service--out of this world.  Super efficient and friendly.  Among the best service I've ever had.  All in all, it was a great pleasure.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A nice outside dining experience (we did not go inside, so can't comment on that). People in our party ordered Greek salads, dolmades, and the orange roughy special. Everyone enjoyed their food. Very flavorful and fresh.  The staff seemed happy to accommodate."}
{"text":"The Saganaki seemed to be pre-prepared in some way and re-heated. Sort of weird. It had a thick crust, that on the top corner was sort of cool -- not what is normal for the dish.  I was the only person in the large restaurant mid-afternoon, but needed to call the waiter twice to re-fill my drink.  Food was tasty overall, 3 star. One person $55."}
{"text":"Generic, overpriced and underwhelming is a bad combo.   Server was attentive, but did not seem genuine.  For example, when bringing us our (average) food  he's say things like \" Here we are! Look at this beautiful plate. Doesn't it look so amazing?\" etc.  I found this non-offensively amusing.   Two drinks, an appetizer platter and a salad to share came to $60+ not including tip. Not worth it at all.   The best thing on the plate was the tzatziki, which I put on everything."}
{"text":"My memories of this place are always favourable.  When I worked at Canadian Stage, opening night was the thing.  I would put in the show, get all my bookkeeping out of the way, and then head across the street with the rest of the company for a cocktail and some Greek appetizers.  They've since moved to King Street inside the theatre district, but the flavour remains the same.  Targeting the theatre crowds and downtown lunches, Penelope offers finer Greek dining without the need to drive out to the Danforth.  The décor is simple, and the staff give the place the feeling of a family-run business.  The platters that were put before us never failed to impress and of the items that I've had recently (pork souvlaki), it still holds up.  I'm sure there's way better places on the Danforth, but you'll never eat there and make it down the DVP in time for an 8:00pm curtain.  Enjoy this place for what it is.  If it's decent enough for opening night, well, really..."}
{"text":"I had the calamari and shrimp salad it was really good. Im not much a fan of greek food but honestly it was really good."}
{"text":"Pros: - delicious food (especially the grilled calamari) - friendly staff  Cons: - really small portions (they seemed to have decreased the size as compared to before) - pretty expensive  Food: (3 stars) For appetizers we ordered saganaki and green leaves.  Both were very delicious but pretty pricy.  (4 stars) For the main course we got 2 orders of grilled calamari appetizers (7$ cheaper than main course option and just come without salad and rice).  It was decently sized and very tasty (5 stars) We also ordered a mousaka and a souvlaki meal.  The souvlaki meal was really disappointing, for 26$ there was a single row of meat (4-6 pieces), a few vegetables and a few spoons of rice.   (2 stars).  Tasty however nowhere near the price level.    Everyone left pretty hungry.   With a bottle of wine it came to $50 a person including tax and tip.    Ambiance: (4 stars) 4 of us made reservations on Friday at 6pm for 7:30.  When we got there most of the restaurant was empty.  The restaurant was clean, and the washrooms were well kept.   The restaurant had greek sculptures and vases and was playing greek music.     Service: (5 stars) We ordered a bottle of wine as suggested by the waiter, but when it came we found it to be a bit flat (after 3 people tried it) and requested a new one.  Without any trouble he obliged.   Summary: Go there if you want delicious food, and are not too hungry.  The place was not crowded even on a Friday night so if you want a quite dinner this is a good option.  I would have given it 4 stars, but the cost was a bit too much, so I had to deduct an extra star. I would go there again, but only order appetizers and not expect to be filled.  If I was really craving greek food, I would go to Danforth to any of the restaurants there."}
{"text":"Very clean and authentic Greek restaurant staffed by waiters who know Greek food for real. I had the lamb which was so tender and easily pulled from the bone. I could not finish it. So the main was a success. Also successful was the appetizer of squid, which was also very nicely done.  Unfortunately, the side of potatoes were half raw. They were so hard I should have asked for cooked potatoes to be brought instead. Shame. Also, so surprised that the tzatiki was tasteless... come on stop compromising this is a $50 per person lunch. Anyway my friend said that the souvliki was also very good. The waiter was polite, friendly and knew his stuff and the recommendations were also spot-on (lamb). Good man.  I liked the big massive Greek pillar in the middle of the dining room because it added an air of authenticity to Penelope."}
{"text":"We went to Penelope restaurant. It is an old established fine dining restaurant. I first came here 20 years ago.  Penelope is a nicely decorated restaurant. It wasn't crowded. The service was brisk and formal.  The bread was store bought and ordinary.  We started with the grilled calamari. It was very good and delicious. My friend had the lamb chops. She thought it was okay. I had the roasted lamb. It was covered with this cheap brown sauce! The sauce ruined the lamb.  Would I go back? I doubt it. Penelope is an old restaurant that is stuck in the eighties."}
{"text":"Roast lamb was a lil over cooked. The spinach pie was kinda blend. The restaurant interior environment is good though. Wouldn't go back for food just because there are many better Greek restaurants."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptic  walking into this Greek establishment because usually I find Greek food bland, but this restaurant gave me a reality check! I ordered a spinach pie which came with the most succulent potatoes. The Spinach pie was extremely delicious, flaky, and savoury. The customer service was top notch and the ambiance was brilliant. This restaurant has made me a born again Greek Food Eater"}
{"text":"The service was impeccable. Very friendly and professional waitstaff.  The hummus appetizer was quite flavourful. The platters have a ton of food and are quite well priced. I loved the lemon soup, the rice was the perfect texture.  The glass of white wine I had was dry and complimented my dinner quite nicely.  We sat on the patio, so if you need to use the restroom, it's a bit of a walk. You have to go up some stairs in the back of the dining room.  I would certainly come back and try dessert at my next visit."}
{"text":"This place is great! We order team dinner here once a week because the service is impeccable, and the food is delicious and reasonably price. Also took the girlfriend here and she loved it!  Definitely try the grilled calamari!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here on Saturday night with my two teenagers before the theater.  The manager kindly accommodated me without a reservation, even though the restaurant was pretty full with the pre-theatre crowd.    My two non-adventurous eaters had the chicken souvalaki with rice, potatoes and vegetables.  The chicken was flavorful and cooked perfectly (i.e. not dry) and the portions were very generous.  I opted for the lamb with Greek salad, vegetables (in lieu of rice) and potatoes.  The lemon roasted potatoes are outstanding so we were all disappointed that we each only received two small wedges on our plates.  The lamb was tender and the portion was huge.  I couldn't finish it all.    Overall, the food was decent and the service was good.  The prices were on the higher end of what you would normally pay for Greek food elsewhere in the City, probably because they are across the street from the theaters and have a captive audience who want a good meal which is served relatively quickly.  By 7:30 pm, the restaurant was virtually deserted."}
{"text":"Had a great pre-theater dinner. We had a wonderful waitress and assist staff. Our waitress was friendly and helpful as was the young man who poured the water and took finished dishes away. The food was great. We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The food was mediocre - the calamari was good, but the chicken kebob was tough and stringy.  What was worse was the service.  We attended just before the theatre crowd left the restaurant.  The servers were flustered and unprofessional. One of the hosts was yelling at a server about where she seated a party.  The food was slow in coming (although we weren't in a rush), and the server got confused a few times.  There's better Greek food elsewhere in Toronto."}
{"text":"Penelope Greek Restaurant was a very happy surprise.  We had arrived late in the afternoon, tired, hot, hungry, and looking for something good without having to walk far from the hotel.  Penelope fit the bill perfectly!  We started off with a spectacular flamed brandy kefalotyri cheese (sheep's milk) which delivered a great crusty/smoky/toasty flavor.  Definitely not like a crumbly feta, this cheese had texture and personality like a parmigiano.  Went well with a bottle of Fix Hellas beer - a refreshing hoppy accompaniment. We also had the grilled octopus which was tender and delicious, and a cold meze assortment of their hummus, eggplant caviar, and tapenade. For the main courses, we shared lamb chops - 4 perfectly cooked chops, tender and juicy; garlic shrimp in a very good garlicky white wine sauce; and a grilled seafood souvlaki of shrimp (delicious, nice char marks) and scallops (a slight miss because they did not remove the tough hinge muscle which jarred with the succulence of the dish). The accompanying rice pilaf sides were also quite good, very buttery. Grilled pita had a good char and flavor but still soft inside with the crisp exterior - like naan. Excellent friendly service  and  decor, modern but soothing. Desserts were also excellent: we had the tiramisu (strong coffee flavor but not bitter); the tartufo (dense rich chocolate with intense raspberry sorbet inner); and the galaktoboureko - a phyllo pastry with smooth custard and honey. The desserts were very refined, not too sweet nor cloying, but satisfying."}
{"text":"This restaurant has your typical greek food. I ordered the spinach pie and grilled lamp chops. The spinach pie was mediocre, the grilled lamp chops was delicious and made exactly as I had ordered. The side potatoes it came with was dry though.  The servers were attentive but not extraordinary by any means. Overall, it was generic and overpriced. Im glad I have tried it, but Id think twice about going back."}
{"text":"What a find!!! My son, a friend and I were wandering around looking for a place to grab dinner before the theater when my son exclaimed, \"Look.... There's a Greek place\".  Note to self: Always take son's restaurant advice. This place was amazing!  The host was delightful.... promising us that even though we had to wait 5-10 minutes for a table (I love full restaurants.... empty ones make me nervous and sad) we would definitely be out within the hour needed for our show.  We were... and yet we never felt a bit rushed.  We started with a Mediterranean dipping platter (hummus, tzatziki, meletzana, feta and olives) and an order of saganaki to share.  FANTASTIC!  The dips were all fresh and tasty and the saganiki was PERFECT.  It was even flamed at the table (as it should be).  The only complaint was there wasn't quite enough pita bread to go around.  No worries though because those dips were so yummy that we finished them with our forks.   As entrees my son and I each had a Greek salad and our friend had the octopus.  That salad was fantastic.  Probably the best Greek salad I've ever had, and I've eaten LOTS of Greek salads in my 50 years.  It was fresh and huge and the dressing was absolutely perfect.  YUM!  I was in salad heaven!!!  The octopus was rated as \"delicious'.  For dessert the three of us shared order of rice pudding which was creamy and full of golden raisins and lots and lots of vanilla.  It was the perfect finish to our meal!"}
{"text":"A very nice greek restaurant and a good place to go for pre-theatre dinner. There are nearly as many seafood dishes as meat, with whole sea bass and red snapper grilled to order.  Like many North American Greek inspired restaurants, steamed vegetables, roasted potatoes and flavorful rice accompany all the grilled main dishes.  Great saganake as well!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst place.  Food was mediocre at best and the servers were all incredibly rude.  We booked a corporate lunch and told them it was going to be separate bills at the beginning.  They started screaming at us and blaming us for not being able to figure out how to do separate billing. Do not go here.  Oh... And they gave me back the wrong person's credit card. Luckily it was one of the people I was with."}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch, we were not disappointed! The food was excellent and the atmosphere was amazing. I hope we'll be able to make  it back to Toronto someday. And when we do, we will come here!"}
{"text":"Did not like this place at all. The food was *very* expensive for what it was and completely lackluster.  The service was top-notch and the atmosphere was splendid. The food was just not good.  Appetizer ======= Kalamari: C+ Very lightly breaded and lightly fried. There was really no flavor. No spices.  Like eating grilled rubber.  The cream cheese (yes, cream cheese) that was served with it simply didn't go well with the food.  Too many O's and not enough tendrils.  For the price, there should've been more tendrils.  Entrees ====== Grilled Salmon: B- It pains me to give any salmon less than an A. However, this salmon, while very tasty and having great grill marks, was vastly overdone. Dry as paper.  At least it had great flavor.  Seafood Giovesti: C+ Could have been great but it had the oddest cinnamon flavor.  Why did they do that?!?  I couldn't finish it -- the odd cinnamon flavor was overpowering and ruining the dish."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just have this feeling like: \"I don't want fish... And don't really want meat, too... Hey, I don't know what I want - maybe it's time for that Greek stuff?\" Immediately followed by some jokes about Opa Souvlaki and food courts, the idea usually transforms into: \"Ok, so let's just go to that Penelope place - you remember, next to the theatre?\"  So we drop in, and there is always a free table (that place is huge), and we usually end up sitting on a sort of a podium in the middle of the restaurant. And start waiting...  Service is, as far as I can understand, authentically Greek - no one is in rush, they do it all at their own pace. I've seen people exploding and leaving the restaurant after waiting for the server for like ten minutes, making signs and still not receiving any attention.  Patience guys, eventually they will arrive! Than you may take your time, because the menu is quite ample. For drinks I like to go for the authentic Greek wines, just ask your server - they are helpful in that. Food is good - I tried many different plates, never disappointed.  A bit on the pricey side, mostly due to the location and size of the restaurant, I guess. Not a place where I could go weekly, but once in a couple of months - for sure!"}
