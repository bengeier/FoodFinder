{"text":"Good diner. Good prices. Great friendly service from Helen and her staff. Have not been disappointed in any meal yet. Become one of the regulars. It's a shame Helen closed. I will miss mornings with Helen."}
{"text":"We had a group of 8, the waitress was trying to move the tables herself, I went over to help her lift the tables. The owner came out and snarled at me to stay over by the door until we were called. She was nasty, glared at me, then mumbled something under her breath. 

We had been regular breakfast customers. Food was fine, slightly overcooked and overpriced but fine for a breakfast stop."}
{"text":"Helen's offers basic diner food - biscuits and gravy, egg skillets with potatoes and such - the food is prepared with care and reasonably priced.  Helen is a kind, open person - she was happy to take my request for a tofu scramble (I was able to buy tofu at Danny's Organic Marketplace a couple doors down) making this perhaps the only vegan-friendly breakfast joint in the East Side of the Cleveland suburbs outside of Tommy's!

I confess - the tofu scramble wasn't quite what I expected but for a first-time attempt, it wasn't bad and it was better than just eating potatoes and toast as I usually end up at breakfast places (*ahem* Yours Truly on Fairmount!)."}
