{"text":"love the food. The quantity, quality and prices are perfect. the $1 ice cream is amazing ."}
{"text":"So delicious, fun atmosphere and friendly service! They had a binder with pictures of their food, which really helped me decide. I loved it! Will definitely come back! Namatse!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  They're so kind & will recommend dishes that will fit your dietary needs.  Food is amazing
with great portion sizes & prices.  Chat with Raj!"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food.  Specially for a vegetarian individual, highly recommended given the wide variety of choices.  Staff is inviting and the place is very clean.  Given the unbearable hot weather is upon us, they have options of refreshing drinks for the summer to help you cool down!!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the veg pulav, veg biryani, Indian bhel, and pav bhaji. Excellent service and a kind host, who even offered complementary samples of masala tea. If in doubt of what to order, just ask the proprietor, who gave impeccable recommendations for both myself, having always enjoyed Indian food, and for my aunt's first Indian food experience. They were even able to customize our level of spice! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a treasure of a restaurant!  I had never eaten at an Indian restaurant, and was looking forward to trying some new foods.  The \"picture book\" menu was great, allowing me to look at all their selections, and ask Bali (the owner) questions about everything.  Bali is very friendly and happy to acquaint people with the dishes.  She runs a great little place with high-quality food, and I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Love the food at this place. Starting from samosa, their thali, chole bhature, poori sabji, they taste home made and delicious. When we are lazy and do not want to cook, we end up ordering their thali. Yesterday we also ordered catering service from them, and all our guests could not stop raving about how good the food was. We are definitely impressed by them. Hope they keep up the good quality and the flavor."}
{"text":"The food was tasty but the portion were small and came in plastic takeout form. the price is a little high for this kind of serving. the ice cream was special . I will come back"}
{"text":"I believe this is a family business and very new so they may be working out some of the kinks of a new business and may need to get their staff a little more organized and on top of things but the food is awesome! My friends and I tried and shared M15 Punjabi Thali, and M99 Namaste Special Platter for our meal, and for appetizers A7 Kutchi Dabeli and another one I can't remember the name of but everything was exceptionally tasty, very nicely seasoned and spiced, seemed very fresh, and we were quite satisfied. I bought some cookies they had for dessert which were crust-like, flakey, coated in a sweet glaze and delicious. I will definitely go back and highly recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today, loved the Namaste Special platter.  At the end of meal  the owner offered masala tea. Really delicious and fragrant food!"}
{"text":"Glad to have found this Hidden gem!  

Was on my typical lunch journey, but this time feeling the need for a change from the typical sandwich/fast dining joints. I was pleasantly surprised to run across Namaste.  At first glance (thinking to myself ) new, clean, and inviting... must try it!    I really enjoyed the Paneer curry and Bhatura. Oh yeah and of course... I had to get my Samosa fix on!  I found the food quite authentic and tasty,  just the right amount of spice for me.

As we continue to trend in the high triple digits I wish Namaste offered some blended fruit smoothie drinks to cool us off, and that definitely would have topped off my meal!     Hint...Hint...!!!    :D

Namaste will definitely be one of my go to places for lunch."}
{"text":"Good restaurant for Indian vegetarian food. Lot of vegan options 
Their choke, samosa, Thalis, bhel, milk shakes are very good however Paav bhaji was not that great. 
I will certainly visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Pav bhaji (potatoe and bread) was with old oil, tasted bad. Bhatura (white flour fried bread) was under cooked.  Chole (chick peas) were raw and under cooked.  Nothing really tasted like Indian food.  Menu items way overpriced.  This is in comparison to equivalent competition near by.  Even after informing them of this and trying something else, we were asked if we would pay the difference.  That's poor business sense!  No matter how convenient this was, we will travel further to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at Namaste and they have only surpassed my expectations. Raj took care of us both the times and he made us feel like we were eating at home.Aaloo Paratha, Samosa chat, Mirchi Bhaji, Biryani, Bhel, Pav Bhaji, mix platter Thali...We just loved all of them. Raj made sure of the spice level for us as we needed them to be hot. The taste was authentic...In the end we tried some sweets, lassi and beetle leaf Pan...Had a great time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to try a new place near us with so many vegan options - and we were not let down! 

We were greeted by amazing staff, who were very helpful and answered all our questions. The order came out quickly and was delicious! We cannot wait to come back with the rest of our family!

Great place to add a little variety"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and it was absolutely delicious, I would recommend it highly. The food was good, the place was spotless, what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"We walked in for lunch not knowing what to expect and we found the cutest little Indian vegetarian restaurant! The man serving us was super helpful and enthusiastic about the menu. We got the samosa, which is this really great fritter filled with vegetables and potatoes, and I'd recommend them to anyone who likes Indian food. Masala tea was super tasty too. Definitely a fair price for the value."}

{"text":"My friend took me to this amazing space over the weekend and I was blown away. As a gluten free vegan who has sincere allergic reactions to gluten and dairy, I am always cautious when I dine out. Namaste took my food allergies very seriously. I had absolutely no issues with cross contamination or illness afterward. The staff and owner were incredibly kind and the food was wonderful. There are images of every dish, so there is no reason to question what you will receive. Both of the items I ordered and the dish my friend ordered looked exactly like the photos, which was highly impressive. I have to state that my experience was nothing short of fantastic. It is clean, the outdoor patio is nice and the staff took the time to really speak with us. I'll certainly make this a spot I frequent."}
{"text":"This was truly one of the best Indian food experiences we have had in Phoenix. The food is like the best home cooked meal. Such high quality and not too rich but so delicious we could hardly believe it. Wow. We loved the wide variety of vegan options. Wow! Wish we had find it earlier and plan to visit often."}
{"text":"sadly I have to write a bad review, I got food poisoning from here, I called to speak to the manager just to inform, but when I asked for the manager one of the employees told me to call back later, so I did, then I kept trying to call back and I never got an answer. Other than that when I ordered the food, the front service was very polite and nice."}
{"text":"We love the food here a lot of it I didn't recognize so I didn't know exactly what I was getting but it was all very different and very good"}
{"text":"We have been here twice...both times tasty food... kutchi dabeli is best to try if you wanna try this restaurant.... good service..."}
{"text":"The food was great! Everything had a great taste and the service was nice. We ordered the Gobi Manchurian, Kati Roll Paneer, and Lamb Curry with naan! I'm sure the other items on the menu are just as tasty. Great place to stop by if you are craving Indian food."}
{"text":"The flavors are amazing and we didn't leave feeling heavy and extra full like other Indian places."}
{"text":"Driving through and saw this place, so we decided to give it a try...so glad we did!!  First things first, the place is very clean, available for dine or take out, and the customer service is FANTASTIC!  We were told it's family owned and operated, which is always a plus for me!  We had a few questions about the menu and we were given great advice on what to order.  We had: mango lissa (amazing!!) which we were told is made fresh HOURLY!, gulab jamun (which are delicious little donut like balls soaked in a sweet syrupy sauce...definitely try those!), samosas (that come w a delicious cilantro sauce, lamb vindaloo (highly recommend), chicken tikka masala, and an order of the most delicious garlic naan I've ever had!!  If I could give 6 Stars, I would...will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I know this used to be a vegetarian/vegan restaurant, but I'm SO HAPPY it's not anymore! Lol. It's great to have a spot like this in our neighborhood. I can't wait to try other dishes. I stopped in today and placed a to go order of butter chicken and garlic naan. The butter chicken had a nice level of spice to it..I don't like things super spicy, and this was just right for me. Left my mouth spicy, but tolerable while having good flavor. Rice was a nice texture and the garlic naan was YUMMY! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was flavorful and pretty good, but way too oily and too small of portions for the price you pay. The service is not good, the menu is confusing, and the feel inside the restaurant is very odd, almost always and too quiet. Decent but I wouldn't recommend!"}
{"text":"The tasty touch offers decent value for your money. I have eaten here once, I had the chicken tikka masala. It was spicy and good. I ordered the naan bread, which was your typical naan bread. Again, the prices are good, quality Indian food in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food was ok.  I gave 1 Star because of service. Slow and extremely rude.  I have popular social media pages where I post pics of restaurants and menus. I always give reviews and promote restaurants I like.  I would have done the same here, but was blown away by how incredibly rude and slow they were.  Namaste, yeah right, LOL."}
{"text":"My take: Not the ambience or feel of a typical Indian restaurant, but good for a change of pace or a quick bite. Food was good and the quality was good. Probably a 4-star had they been more accommodating.

Review: I was a little hesitant to try Namaste since I'm used to a more traditional setting for Indian food, but since I'm down with Indian food and always like to see vegetarian restaurants survive and thrive, I gave it a shot.

On the positive side, the food had familiar flavors and seemed to be of good quality. No complaints there. The gentleman who took my order was friendly and helpful and the 3-ring binder with photos of the food was a nice touch.

I typically order my food (Thai, Indian, Mexican, etc.) at a medium spice rating. Apparently \"medium\" here is quite a bit hotter than what I'm accustomed to. Keep in mind that this is based on only one visit here, but I will definitely be trying \"mild\" next time.

One slightly disappointing aspect of my visit came when I explained that the dish was much spicier than anticipated. I had eaten about one third of it before reaching a point where I couldn't go any farther. It became apparent that they were not willing to remake the dish -- something that is a pretty standard accommodation when there's an issue such as this. He offered a couple of other options, the first couple of which didn't help. Finally some veggie rice was extended and that helped to tone things down a little bit.

In the end, I wasn't as happy as I would have been had they simply offered to cook up another dollar worth of chickpeas for me, but I'll be back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Wow excellent food! We tried the Kati roll paneer, Gobi Manchurian, and lamb curry with naan. Every item exceeded our expectations. Great flavors and service. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I asked them for the dish with the most vegetables and what they gave me was basically a giant plate of rice. Either they really don't have any dishes with vegetables (which in that case their name \"veg kitchen\" is completely misleading\") or the guy just didn't know what the hell he was talking about when he told the lady cooking in back what I wanted. The dish was edible but tasted like minute rice with some Indian sauce you could buy for $2 at a grocery store and microwave yourself. Won't be back. See pic of the dish they gave me."}
{"text":"For vegetarians this restaurant is not worth to visit. I ordered gobi Manchurian, dabeli, kadai paneer, garlic naan dinner from here and really disappointed, I garbage more than half of the food. Food isn't at all tasty."}
{"text":"If you are looking for amazing Indian home cooked food, look no further. Right spice level - so good that even the kids enjoy every bit of the scrumptious food. Courteous staff. Amazing ambience and prompt service. The family loves to go here all the time!! Must go!!"}
{"text":"Great place, can't wait to go back and try some other items. Very reasonably priced food. Portion are a not too big, so you don't feel too stuffed when you leave.  Get the talie dinner. My new favorite indian restaurant near me."}
{"text":"Ordered food and mango lassi + chikoo milkshake from here yesterday.. you get such small quantity of food also the throwable cup they provided was already used. With regards to taste it is just ok .. 

Not recommended !"}
{"text":"Not worth the price. Quantity is small and not close to any Indian food items esp snacks. Tried Dabeli,bhelpuri and vada pav. Worst food ever. Won't recommend anyone ever."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. I had the Special Platter. The bread (Pav) was spoiled and smelly.
I am sure something in the Raita was not fresh either."}
{"text":"I'm really happy I tried this place tonight. I'm not kidding, I drove around this area for 25 minutes trying to figure out what to eat because I've had everything around here so many times. I brought the paneer curry and aloo curry home. Excellent, fresh flavors. Both entrees were $6 or 7 dollars. I ordered one with bread and one with rice. Good food for reasonable price and it's a local family business... I'll be back."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service, and GREAT food! Authentic Indian food and the taste was delicious. My girlfriend and I are both Vegan, and their menu is very accommodating. We enjoyed the Namaste sampler platter and the house specialty and both were amazing. Nice serving size for price as well. We also enjoyed a few of their deserts and had to order some to go! We will definitely be back for more! Thank you Namaste Veg Kitchen."}
{"text":"Delicious excellent food!  I will go there anytime I go to Turn Style Consignment in the same area.  I can shop and eat conveniently!  Love the fennel tea!  What makes this place even more delicious is the price!  Thank you for being affordable!"}
{"text":"The food is full of flavor. Great portion size. Super clean restaurant. Just wish the dishes were better and plastic wear."}
{"text":"Our first time trying this place, it was delicious!! The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating- we ordered our meals \"spicy\" and the kitchen actually came out and asked us if we were okay and offered to remake our meals. No! They were perfect! We will be regulars here for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was below standard in all respects. Small quantities. Ordered Chole Bhature and Chole were raw. Ordered Pav Bhaji..it tasted old and has to be thrown.  Will not be going back. Sev puri was nothing like Sev Puri"}
{"text":"I think we're in love with this restaurant, me, my wife and four year old were there for lunch today and everything was amazing. the folks who own this restaurant are wonderful people. although a vegetarian restaurant there are tons of options for fellow vegans, the few non vegan items I think they can make vegan, you've got to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Poor food quality. We ordered Veg Biryani. But it was a fried rice with Biryani Masala."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Fantastic food, great service and a very clean place. The food is freshly made and you can feel it in the taste. The owners are super friendly and make you feel at home. I drive around 40 miles to come to this place, passing up all other Indian restaurants on the way. Their Indo-Chinese and Chaat are a real treat!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Namaste Veg Kitchen for the first time today. The man who helped us behind the counter, who I'm assuming was also the manager, was so kind in helping us pick what to eat. We ordered the samosa chaat, mini thali, aloo puri, and chole rice, all pretty delicious. We got there right before they closed in the rain and they still let us order and sit and eat for as long as we wanted. Do make sure to try the chai (masala tea) or mango lasssi drinks with your meal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Definitely a tasty touch! The lamb vindaloo and garlic naan is my favorite! Super delicious and great service!"}
{"text":"A place calling itself \"Veg Kitchen \" should be serving fresh vegetables. Unfortunately, the skimpy vegetable portions in each dish were either frozen or canned. Very disappointing . By the way, my wife's dish tasted suspiciously like Rice-A-Roni."}
{"text":"Since this restaurant opened I can get my Indian fix anytime I want. The Paneer is fantastic. Also, try the Frankie Roll-it's the best."}
{"text":"Finding a restaurant where I can eat absolutely anything on the menu (and really want to) is so exciting for me! The food here was delicious. I got the platter that came with three curries so I could try a little bit of everything, it was only $11 I believe for a LOT of food. Roti, pickled veggies, rice, curries, a little dessert. Only complaint was the rice came out kind of cold but it was the end of the day so I get it. Also I personally didn't like the dessert but I think that was just me. The food was great, flavorful with just a kick of spice! My BF got a cheese filled bread with a side of spicy yogurt dipping sauce and he enjoyed it, so did I. He also got mango lassi which he liked. Good prices, good service, great food. I'd like to try more but I'm pretty sure I'll end up ordering the platter every time I come!"}
{"text":"This place is changed its not namsate veg. We found flavors little bland. We ate dabeli and chicken biryani. Dabeli was good but chicken biryani was ok."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian food in the area. My wife is vegetarian and I'm a meatatarian but we both love Indian food and we're glad we found this place. Food is delicious, prices are very reasonable and the place is very well designed and clean. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken biryani rice to go and had it at home. It was by far the best I've had for a long time!   Well done TTT!!!"}
{"text":"Visited here after a few months. The new management have taken over and things are great. 

Food is really good and authentic Indian. Their Dabeli and Channa natural were awesome. 

Definetly a place that I will be returning to often."}
{"text":"Great food and exceptional customer service! I've been to Namaste a few times now and they never disappoint. This family run business offers traditional Indian foods with a take away/order at the counter set up. While no, it's not your typical \"sit down fancy Indian restaurant, I think it's a refreshing change to have more varieties of \"fast food\" in the valley. They offer a wide selection of vegetarian/vegan and gluten free options. The staff is extremely friendly and gave detailed descriptions of the meals and offered some great suggestions. They have a lovely patio to dine on or you can eat inside. I've never been disappointed with any meal I've had there. The portions are plentiful and I always leave with leftovers. They also offer a lovely selection of sweet and savories you can enjoy after your meal or bring home for later. I would highly recommend checking this place out! Even if you think you don't like Indian food- give it a try. My picky teen even found a few things she really enjoyed."}
{"text":"We love, love, love Namaste.  So happy to have them in our neighborhood.  The staff is so friendly and kind. They take the time needed to explain their menu to make sure you order what you would like.  Recently, they made a book explaining each dish with pictures and that helps a lot if you're not familiar with Indian food.  
We are now regulars there.  My goal is to try everything on the menu eventually. I'm having a super hard time understanding the negative reviews.  
Try the samosa chaat.  So darn good. 
Namaste"}
{"text":"Bummer. Looks like they changed names and owners, and are no longer veg/vegan. The online menu does not mark items as vegan either."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised how satisfied I was from a vegetarian restaurant. The service and staff were very courteous and helpful in our food decision and even checked in periodically to make sure we were doing ok. Samosa are a must and try the namaste plate, it's a little bit of everything. 

Also, it does say that they are a \"Indian vegetarian\" restaurant so don't get it confused with a grabba green or something similar."}
{"text":"Take it from someone who's grown up eating Indian food.  This is absolutely no good.  I know there aren't many Indian restaurants in the valley, but Namaste is overpriced fast food at best.  The service was poor, the food was not good at all.  My wife and I ordered the Punjabi Thali and the Veg Biriyani.  Her biriyani neither looked nor tasted anything like a biriyani should.  It had clumps of spices like as if you were using a mix, and purple colored potatoes with no signs of other vegetables.  My thali had bhatura that tasted somewhat stale, like fried in stale oil, and the curry that came with it was supposed to be a paneer curry, but had maybe 2 pieces of paneer and a bland sauce.  The raita had a sour taste and the pickle had no spice or flavor.

We could not finish our meal.  The one positive was the Tea which had a good flavor.  For Indian \"fast food\" you're much better off going to somewhere like Pastries and Chaat.  Skip this."}
{"text":"First time here and I drove all the way from Tolleson just to try them out and it was sooo worth it!!! I ordered practically all the vegan appetizers for a meal and I love the variety and flavor, so happy I feel like dancing, it was that good!!! I'll be making many more special trips just for their food. You can really taste the love they put into it."}
{"text":"Good new place. Food is pretty good. Super clean place. We just wanted a snack and shared Frankie Roll!! It was delicious. They are super nice and friendly. I recommend this place. Try em out."}
{"text":"Fabulous
Been living in this area for 20 years
Have tried many Indian restaurants am over the valley and I have a couple of favorites
But I just discovered this place was previously called Namaste. Different owner.

Food is excellent
Price is appropriate for the quality northern Indian food.
Garlic Naan, butter Naan.

Went standard, chicken tikki masala
Hubby had tandoori combo. Nice array of different items.
Gulab jamun for dessert.

We'd go back in a heart beat.

Yum yum yum
Friendly owner too."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and it did not disappoint! The food is reasonably priced and the service is friendly.

The menu is a bit confusing on the website. I was not familiar with many of the items, and I have been eating Indian food my whole life. But at least I ventured outside my comfort zone and tried something new!

We started out with the samosas which were excellent. We also had aloo curry and paneer curry with bhaturas. What are bhaturas you ask? Well, it is similar to Indian fry bread. Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. Completely decadent and delicious to dip in the curries! Both curries were delicious as well. I didn't see paneer curry on the menu but I asked if they had it and sure enough they did.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had a Groupon and enjoyed my curry of the day! The rice was good and the curry was pretty good too. I would go back again to try more of the dishes!"}
{"text":"Veg food; good choices; nice decor and great location; definitely recommended for family; guess they are into their 3 week"}
{"text":"Great food with lots of variety. Very friendly and helpful when deciding on menu options."}
{"text":"We were excited to have a new vegetarian restaurant opening in our area and love Indian food. We ordered a variety of foods and really enjoyed them all! The house specialty was very tasty. My only complaint would be that the portion sizes are a bit small. The Paneer Curry was very flavorful as was the rice dish we shared. The spicy paneer stuffed into bread was great as well but can't remember the name of it. The menu on the outside window has photos of the food, making it much easier to order. The staff was very friendly and they have a pet friendly patio as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 meals takeout. 
When i arrived home only 1 was in the bag

Searched for a phone number to call so when i went back it would b ready

No answer at phone number
Drove all the way back for 2 nd missing meal
Waited again
Drove home 
Finally tasted the food 

Not worth the time or overpricing
Never going back
Beyond disappointing food, taste/quality and service. 
This place will close within 6 months."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! Must try is malai chicken! The atmosphere is lively and great crowd. Great touch! Easy to find parking and right next to Walmart. It's a quick and easy stop with the family to grocery shop and eat awesome food!"}
{"text":"On a vacation back to AZ, and we've had way too much meat recently. It was time to get our vegetarian on. 

This is a wonderful little restaurant, wonderful flavors, good prices, the works. One of the gripes I've heard from Indian coworkers about the standard fare Indian restaurants is that it is over rich food that nobody eats on a regular basis in India - its food you'd get at a wedding or other special occasion. 

Not so here - you get a large variety of choices and sides, and it seems to be what you might actually eat for lunch or dinner on a regular basis in India. This is the first time I've ever found this in the states. 

I have a soft spot in my heart for Indian vegetarian food, because it embraces the vegetables. No need for \"I can't believe it's not turkey!\" or \"we swear it tastes just like meat!\" It's vegetables and they can be magical all by themselves. And they are here. I wish I could visit more often, but I don't live in Arizona anymore :(

Do you feel like Indian? Is your heart in arrhythmia thinking about the richness and saltiness of another chicken tikka masala? Give these guys a shot.

Only comment, to make the menu a bit more accessible for novices (though it was well explained to us, during a rush I could see things getting awkward) might be some more simplified plate options presented as the things to get. Along the lines of \"three curries,  rice and bread,  pick your own or let us pick for you\" kind of thing. That's ultimately what the thali meals really are,  but highlighting them makes it an easy intro."}
{"text":"Great space and wonderful service. I liked how the three ring binder showed the dishes in more detail. Here are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options to choose from. The desserts looked great too!

The food came out pretty quickly and very warm! But BOY the food is SPICY! I don't think I was prepared to have my nose run the entire time. I ordered the samosas and the chickpea curry combo plate. 

Everything looked and smelled great- I just wish my palette was ready for the spice!

*update- less than one hour later, I'm bloated and my sensitive stomach is not feeling too good"}
{"text":"The place is nice clean and the location is good too. One paneer dish was tasty and paranthas were good too. Paneer Frankie was a joke little paneer more onions, tiny portion, we also ordered poori aloo, aloo was good it cam with 3 poori, not how they decided on this figure. Pooris were tiny. They could have made them bigger and 2 else smaller then the count shud have been 4. 
With such smaller portions which were overpriced it honestly does not work for us. It also does not work in this market where Om, pastries and chaat and the likes are doing very well by serving good portions at right price."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Their special thali is a great value.  Also love the spicy dabeli. For dessert we enjoyed coconut barphi. Pan was also good"}
{"text":"This is a great new option for Indian food. They serve mostly north indian veterinarian food, and include some unique dishes from western India. 
The dishes they serve are NOT the rich and oily ones that is very common in Indian restaurants in US. The dishes are also very reasonably priced. They have a menu book which includes pictures of the dishes that could help those who are not familiar with these dishes.
We liked their chaats, samosa, chole batura, poori, pulav (in mini thali) etc.
One thing they could improve upon is the the way they packed Sev Dahi Chaat, it had the yogurt already mixed in, which made it a little soggy by the time it was home. They could instead pack the liquids separately.
Seems like a family run place, with experienced women in the kitchen cooking the way they cook at home. Most of the poor reviews of this place seems to be from the initial days (they launched around 3 months back), I guess they have now got their act together. I had not been there during the early days."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It's very close to my home, it's vegetarian (which I am vegan), and it's indian food (who doesn't love indian food?). But sadly, I really didn't. I called in an order for take out. The person on the phone was very awkward. The convo went something like this:
Him: Hello?
Me: Is this Namaste?
Him: Yes.
Me:..... can I place an order to go?
Him: Yes.
*awkward pause*
Me: Ok... well, here's what I want....
I literally felt I was calling some stranger at home. Awkward convo. When my bf and I arrived, it wasn't much better. He didn't smile. He didn't thank us. He just told us how much we owed when I told him I already called and handed us our food. I'm glad we didn't dine in. I can only imagine how much weirder it would have gotten.
And finally, the food. The food was actually okay. Not spicy enough. He didn't even ask how spicy I wanted it... which is another weird thing. And the portions were TINY. I am a small girl, I am 100 lbs, and even I was still hungry. This has never happened to me before, especially at an Indian restaurant. I ALWAYS take half of my food to go because I cannot finish it. Both my boyfriend and I ordered Samosas (you get 2 small ones per order btw) and 2 entrees (curry with fry bread) and we were both hungry still. I ended up reheating our left overs as soon as we ate. :( 
The reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because it's all veggie and the food wasn't bad. Just the portions... and the fact that he didn't bother to ask us how spicy we wanted it so it was not spicy enough for either of us.
Unfortunately, I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I'm super excited about this place! It's well priced, pretty tasty, and all vegetarian/vegan! And it's not too far from my home!

We had the vada pav, samosa, aloo curry, and paneer curry. The vada pav was something I had never had before. It was like a samosa in a yummy Hawaiian bun. The samosa was really good..The paneer curry was creamy and something I would order again. The aloo was okay, I liked the huge chunks of potatoes. 

The rice they served with the food was not basmati...very clearly long grain white rice. Not a big deal, but just something that was noticed. I also not a huge fan of the disposable tableware. Just not very ecofriendly or conscious. 

Aside from those two things, I'm sure that I'll be back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome Service! Must try for vegetarians looking for tasty choices.

Family owned and operated."}
{"text":"The Jolly Diners landed at Namaste Veg Kitchen tonight.  For appetizers we had Samosa, and Kutchi Dabeli. Both were very good.  The entrees consisted of Bhatura Sabzi, Paneer Curry & Bhatura, and Aloo Paratha. We requested that all were made mild in terms of spiciness.  This establishment is mainly for take out as proved by plastic plates,  plastic cutlery(not including any knives),  and plastic water cups. One orders at the front desk. This is not really a cozy spot for a date or for a quiet family meal with good service to give mom a break.   What Namaste Veg Kitchen is however is a no frills clean place with great tasting Indian cuisine.The Jolly Diners gave a rating of 4.6 stars based soley on the food."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for something that differs from your every day street corner restaurant. Creative menu, delicious food, healthy vegetarian and vegan options..."}
{"text":"This is a new Indian Vegetarian restaurant in the neighborhood. We ordered parcels for one mini thali and one vegetable biryani. They forgot to give curry in mini thali; which was not a good first impression. The food was average to below average. The good thing about the restaurant is it is vegetarian with no meat or eggs."}
{"text":"After you recover from the atrocities served at the Mayo Clinic cafeteria, you can come here for amazing vegetarian Indian. So authentic. Sooo flavorful. My mouth is so happy."}
{"text":"I ordered the M3 vegetable rice dish for 6.99 recently. It was disappointing to find just a tablespoon of frozen mixed vegetables in it with a minuscule pinch of fresh cilantro.  When you approach the restaurant there are pictures of the dishes they offer but without any kind of description of the ingredients in them. The owner's accent made it difficult to understand his answers to my questions."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the owner was extremely friendly... we had tandoori platter  and Channa bhatura it tasted awesome... highly recommend this place to go ( the best part is it's not oily)"}
{"text":"3 1/2, but I'm bumping it to 4.  It was a pleasant surprise to learn that a veggie restaurant had opened up in North Phoenix, which is also a good location for North Scottsdale veggie lovers.

With a handful of tables and booths inside (capacity @ 34 people) and another handful of tables on their outside patio, it's a cozy little cafe-like spot. 

I am not an expert when it comes to Indian food, but it does seem like their menu is limited.  There's no dahl/daal, Gobi Manchurian, Aloo Gobi, Aloo Saag, or Masala dishes.  Instead, there is an abundance of puri/roti and Aloo Curry dishes. I also noticed that naan was missing from their menu. Maybe they have it upon request? I'll be sure to ask upon my next visit and will report back accordingly.

I ordered the Samosas and the Vada Pav.  The Samosa dish comes with 2 whole potato-filled samosas, which were fried to a perfectly flaky golden crisp.  I opted for tamarind sauce instead of the mint sauce. 

The Vada Pav came with 2 spicy potato patties on buns (think sliders), garnished with a garlic red chili sauce.  They were delicious, although the buns were very cold and wet/mushy on the bottom. I didn't understand the cause for this, unless the buns were initially frozen... I'm not sure, but aside from that the dish was very good and I would order it again. 

They are a vegetarian restaurant but over 1/2 of the menu is vegan or can be made vegan. Vegan options are marked with a 'V' on the board menu and the printed menu. They do not serve eggs; the non-vegan dishes contain dairy (yogurt or cottage cheese). They do have few gluten-free options marked on the menu as well.  

They have a case with pre-packaged deserts, some of which are vegan, but not labeled as such, so be sure to ask. The prices seem decent, to me, at least for what I ordered. 

I spoke with the owner and inquired about the selection of dishes.  She indicated that since they were so new, she wanted to see how the current dishes sell.  They could possibly expand or modify their selection at a later time.

They are barely a month old, so I know that they have kinks to work out.  I received friendly service and good food; as a vegan, I will definitely continue to patronize them in hopes that they will improve over time.

Located inside the strip mall on the SW corner of Bell and Tatum, between the Big Lots and Walmart.

(Side note, their fountain machine has crushed ice!)"}
{"text":"Good food, nice people. Choice of drunks are limited, but we'll be going back. Just don't forget that they reopen for dinner at 5:30, but there is outside seating in case you forgot (like us)."}
{"text":"First time.  Not sure what to order, asked for vegetables in curry sauce.  Ended up ordering Samosa Chaat without realizing the name or that it had a samosa.  .  Ordered samosa too.  I was very pleasantly surprised that I truly liked the dish even though there wasn't any veggies.  I will be back after reading up on dishes ."}
{"text":"Namaste Veg Kitchen is a nice little counter joint, offering up simple homestyle Indian food - and it's all vegetarian. I tried a mini thali, which came with veggie mixed rice, roti, dal, chickpea curry, and pickled vegetables. I also tried the fennel ice cream which was a tad too sweet for me, but a nice change from the mainstream American flavors. Overall, the food here is good and on the lighter side for restaurant Indian food. My Indian friends really like this place for having food more similar to what they would eat at home. I would recommend it if you're looking for lighter Indian fare. Plus, this place is clean and offers up patio seating."}
{"text":"Located in a big plaza so it was a bit hard to find,

Place serves Indian vegetarian dishes without meat or eggs

Great decor and food!"}
{"text":"cold bland food. Cannot call it indian food by any standards.

These people want to make use of a prime location and want to sell stale food overpriced.

Ordered biryani, chaat and chole batura. Everything is in bad taste.

The garbanzo beans in chaat are straight out of can (cold) and the chaat has huge lumps of potato.They didn't even bother to heat garbanzo beans or properly cut/cook potatoes.

I cannot call the Biryani a biryani because it is fried rice (or just colored rice) made quick and is not a biryani.

Oil used for chole batura is stale.This is a very basic dish and they can't even get this near perfect.

Don't recommend. waste of time and money!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Indian food. I was hesitant to eat here because nobody was in the restaurant but after reading the menu on the window ,  my boyfriend and I were sold. The lady working at the counter was so nice and helpful. I have nut allergies and we are vegan and she helped us navigate the menu. Definitely reccomend"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Great picture menu for people new to Indian cuisine. Amazing bread!! I would go just for the great alone! Masala tea was perfect. Great place to enjoy my midday lunch."}
{"text":"Love The Food.  Vegan friendly. Reasonable Prices.  Very nice owner. She was very accommodating."}
{"text":"Some of the best curry ive had yet!! Super tasty naan as well! Oh and the rice was so gooood too!!"}
