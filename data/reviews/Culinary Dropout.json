{"text":"A friend and I started with the Burrata... Really great char on soft crusty bread with chimicurri, creamy Burrata cheese and tomatoes. Yummy. Next we split the kale and corn salad before splitting the fried chicken. The food was all yummy. Splitting the salad and entree was super smart. The portions are large. 
The waitress grabbed a seat with us to chat, checked in on us enough to be cared for and the perfect amount of leaving us to our  ourselves so we could talk. Loved it and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Wanted to like it... The hipster staff would be better suited for the Arcadia area. Plaid, plaid, plaid. Reminds me of the Vig staff. Food is ok. Gone three times with my employees for work lunches. There was always some sort of issue with someone's grub. Surprised it isn't perfect once I was told that Sam Fox lives on the same corner..."}
{"text":"Came in at 10:45 on a Tuesday right before close and split the chicken club and a house salad with my wife. 

Sandwich was perfect. Absolutely killer. Crisp bacon, grilled chicken was dead on, ripe tomato, warm pretzel roll. so so good. 

Salad was great too, attention to detail... fine dice on the cukes, nice garlicky ranch, simple and great. 

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Omgosh a million times over YES. Such good everything. Great for groups. A little pricey, but.... worth it. I want to live in the kale salad. As well as the pretzels and all the cheeses/meats (even though they can be a bit stingy with some of their portions). New favorite bar in Tempe. Fox Concepts, you guys are so innovative and awesome."}
{"text":"We watched football there this past Sunday and say at the bar with Alex. She is fabulous! Great bartender and entertaining and sweet for a Scottsdale bartender. They have a pretty good happy hour and was a decent spot to watch football if you don't like big sweaty dudes yelling at the TV."}
{"text":"The best part about this restaurant was the unique setting.  It is a quasi-outdoor warehouse with casual seating areas (apart from the restaurant seating) and outdoor games.  Aside from that, not much to recommend it.  The service is awful - slow, inattentive, amateurish, and uninterested, the drinks were weak and just so-so, and the food was bland and did not live up to the restaurant's self proclaimed \"gastropub\" moniker.  But then I'm probably spoiled by the Twin Cities' more sophisticated, maturely developed, and creative restaurant scene, which Phoenix just can't touch."}
{"text":"I have been visiting Culinary Dropout on 7th Street for a few years now and absolutely love the restaurant, food, staff, and overall atmosphere. The food is always spot on; very fresh, made in house, and their main entrees are definitely my favorite part of the menu. Whether I sit at the bar with or sit at a table I always receive great service, both in and outside of peak rush hours. Their happy hour has great specials both for drinks and food but their regular menu has great pricing as well for the quality and quantity that you receive. 

I have made friends with several servers and bartenders while visiting: William, Jeffrey, Wyatt, and Chase are the best in business and I won't sit anywhere else except in their sections or at the bar while they are working. They always go above and beyond to take care of me as a regular and I enjoy watching them interact and entertain heir first time customers as well.

This is one of my favorite restaurants to hang out at and I hope everyone gets to experience the same wonderful atmosphere and customer service that I do!"}
{"text":"Um hello? You're telling me that all my friends can run their tabs through the roof on expensive wine and I can order malt liquor in a bag for $1.50? I'm in. Very interesting menu and in a good way. I got the turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll and absolutely loved it. The pinnacle though should mean more coming from me because I don't care for sweets. Their dessert menu is out of this world. From caramel creme brule to monkey bread. I love this place and the live music that comes with it."}
{"text":"Awful. The staff here is a joke. Made a reservation a week in advance for a group of 10 people for a bachelor party. They gave away our table as we were waiting and were forced to wait another hour as other groups arrived and were seated promptly. Definitely ruined the one group dinner event we had planned and did a good job of making us feel as if our business did not matter."}
{"text":"For having a food spot with this name, I believe he should go back to school. The food was a total disappointment. The pretzel bites tasted like egg nuggets and the cheese fondue was bland. The hummus was decent but we didn't finish any of it. The wings we ordered tasted like the sauce came out of a pre-made bag and were beyond sweet. 
We have years of experience in the restaurant industry and this was a waste of our money. The atmosphere is nice for ADULTS to hang out and play yard games with a drink in a cozy space. I do not recommend this as a family friendly spot. I give them 2 stars for that and that only."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was so good. The beer in a bag was funny and cheap. The pretzel was also better than average. My friend ordered the salmon salad and really enjoyed it. Everything was fresh and came out quickly. Really fun atmosphere. I think I might mak this my new spot. The server was funny and joked around with us. I do not have a single complaint. Great place!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout used to be my favorite go-to destination in Tempe. I'm not saying the food is that great, it was more because of the personable and accommodating bar staff, great ambience, diversity of clientele, and live music on Friday and Saturday nights. However, on a recent visit, my husband and I experienced a rather unusual and disturbing encounter with Jason the General Manager that I won't soon forget. Call it corporate political-correctness run amok, but the way Jason tried to represent his other patrons at the expense of alienating two of his best was inexcusable. Jason was not rude, but let's just say he was a bit...snarky? smug? condescending? Jason came up to us from behind the bar and interrupted our conversation to explain that we were this night, or in the past, a bit too brash. I don't remember his exact words, but this was the gist. This is a bar, after all, and I thought it was typical for people to have loud and lively debates, but I digress. As I challenged him because he clearly did not have his facts straight, he refused to be specific, only saying that \"other people\" concurred. Humbly, I admit that my husband and I can get a little heated in our conversations, WITH EACH OTHER, and if Jason could have identified what either of us said that was rude or offensive, perhaps I would understand. During this berating session, I just looked at him completely bewildered because we had been there less than 30 minutes. Whatever his goal, Jason handled the situation very poorly. Would it not have been better for us to talk directly to the people we offended, if indeed we offended them?

Incidentally, since it's opening, we were in the habit of spending over $300 a week at this Fox restaurant alone. We have chosen to spend that money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Loving the antipasto menu, fireside. It is so fresh, the cuts of meat are beautifully sliced. Delicate, tender & they just melt in your mouth with the selection of cheese. I'm a huge fan! This place has the ambience dialed."}
{"text":"It's lit  great atmosphere, laid back good music, good crowd of people, after eating I pulled the chef to the side to compliment him it was that good! The meatloaf, bread, mac and cheese & fried chicken   are my favorite so far. If you haven't been yet your sleeping on the gem of Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Our first time here and had a fantastic dinner.   Our drinks were unique and refreshing.  Although it was 100 degrees, we sat outside under cool misters.  Our server, Meghan, was very knowledgeable about the menu and had a great personality.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic- the customet service was awful. The waitress blatantly ignored us while we tried to get her attention, then she went off to dance and laugh  and he bffs with the hostess while completely neglecting her job. It also took forever to get our meal.


Definately get the pretzles and the burger though!"}
{"text":"Really good fun and a fun place, kids menu is decent. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had to say THANK YOU to the staff that kept the two phones I left behind on a Wednesday night. Idiot me forgot them and 12hrs later when I came to pick them up my work phone and personal phone were safe and sound (and not stolen). Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars but the hipster staff looks exactly like the hipster guests and I can tell which hipster to ask for services from. I may be being harsh but I personally find it one star worth of annoying. They should at least have some sort of hipster dress code where all the hipsters look like working hipsters instead of guest hipsters. 
Other than the staff not having any resemblance of being employed there I think the place rocks. Good food but not cheap. The scenery makes up for the food prices. The games are fun but it's definitely missing a major bar game = billiards. 
Decor is awesome and so is the rest. Good times."}
{"text":"We got the pretzel bites with provolone cheese fondue! That could have been a meal...u get like 15 pretzels! We had already ordered a Caesar salad and the Fried chicken....way more than enough. My husband got three good sized pieces of chicken with mashed potatoes/gravy as well as coleslaw."}
{"text":"I like it, and if you stop by on a weekend night you will see that so do large numbers of hipsters and gen Y douches."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere with great workers! I went here with a friend about a week ago and loved it! We went during happy hour and snacked on some pretzels and sangria, then ordered some salads. A little on the pricey side if you're going for dinner, but totally worth it. I definitely plan on going here again. The menus big, but you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The space is amazing- great place for drinks and a fun night out.

If you can request River as your server, he will take great care of you!

Ryan the manager really cares about customer feedback and was super accommodating.

The customer service overall would make me want to come back.

The pretzel fondue- my order was off- the pretzels were cold in the middle and underwhelming.

Mussels- a little salty but pretty good.

Monkey bread- yummy! Light and fluffy!"}
{"text":"I recently went here with my friends for a late night dinner on a Saturday night. I like the ambiance of the place. There was a live band and they were all right, but I found them to be a bit loud and made it difficult to talk to the people at the same table. The drinks here were really awesome. I really enjoyed the clown punch. The dirty school girl was also really good. The wait staff was really attentive and would check up on us every so often that we rarely found ourselves without want, but not so attentive that we found ourselves annoyed. The food was all right. I ordered the fish and chips here. And it was just all right in my opinion. I prefer a thinner filet of fish so I get the crispness rather than the softness when getting into the meat of the filet. The real highlight, for me, was the dessert. They have an awesome apple monkey bread that is made to order and served with vanilla ice cream. Now I'm not one to like to eat fruit, especially apple, in my desserts, but this was just so good. I'll go back again just to top off dinner with the monkey bread :)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, and that's comparing it to \"real\" restaurants, not ones located inside casinos, which can be hit or miss.  I've been coming to Hard Rock for 10 years and this place flat out kills it. Delicious, well-prepared, fresh, tasty food with a wide variety of menu items. It can be kind of a pain to hop in a cab every time you want to eat a meal, but now you don't need to.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner, any of those will be delicious.  The fried chicken is awesome, as is the kale salad with crispy shrimp.  Service is great, too."}
{"text":"I discovered this jewel on my last visit to the Phoenix area. The honey trickle fried chicken is great! Cool place to hang and enjoy good food."}
{"text":"I totally love the name of this place...Culinary Dropout! Since I was staying at the W hotel I would pass by this restaurant and thought I'd give it a shot since it seemed like a pretty good place.

I love the fact that this place has a vintage feel; from the tables, chairs, and even the restroom. 

I decided to get the fried chicken since it just sounded delicious. I ordered the pretzel and cheese fondue as an appetizer and some grilled asparagus. The fried chicken was amazing, comes with 3 pieces with 2 biscuits. The biscuits has some honey drizzled as well as the chicken. Totally a must try! The pretzel and cheese fondue was ehh A-O-K not the best. The grilled asparagus was delicious as well."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you happen to find yourself at the Hard Rock wanting a good meal and decent price. It's my favorite of all the places in the HRV."}
{"text":"An experience that will have your tastebuds loving the infused flavors with an atmosphere that pairs great to catch up with a friend, date night or time out with the fam. We went early this week and were greeted wonderfully and had the recommendation to get the crowd favorite pretzel balls - WOW, AMAZING! Hands down you'll have to try the Hijinx & Rye as a cocktail as its new the menu this month (Nov. 2015).** My friend and I split the pork nachos and the butternut squash cannelloni. The crew just switched up the cannelloni and my goodness what a packaged mix of flavors. Love this place so much and can't wait to try it out on Saturday for some rockin' live music. Thanks culinary crew!!

** Fun fact: Culinary Dropout creates the menu and the atmosphere that helps you and your tastebuds explore a bit out of your comfort zone."}
{"text":"Food and ambiance was AMAZING!!  I was being treated by some awesome friends for my birthday and it was my first time dining there..... The place and staff are fantastic!  Our waitress was friendly and informative.  The manager was sweet and she even brought out my birthday dessert.  Thank you Culinary Dropout for a beautiful and memorable birthday!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the decor. The menu had a great selection.  The service was, as others pointed out, a bit sketchy. Our fries were cold, but they brought us hot ones. We never received our second round of drinks. However the food was really tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to eat here the other night and had a great experience! Wes was our server and was very knowledgeable and helpful! His personality definitely brightened our experience. Would definitely recommend trying this place and we'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Nothing spectacular, but had been here one time before and was adequate. Problem is today wife and I met there for lunch and brought our 7 year-old because it's Christmas break. We brought side of rice from Chipotle because that's all he eats. They informed us we couldn't bring it in to their restaurant. Even though we're ordering two full meals and drinks and this isn't impacting our total ticket? Nope...doesn't matter. 
Sorry guys, I understand rules, but use your head. 
Family friendly means sometimes a toddler or young kid is going to bring chicken nuggets so the family can eat at your establishment. You just lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"Incredible food! I have had several items on the menu, and every time I am blown away. Great service, location, and specialty drinks. One of those places I always bring friends and family when they are visiting from out of town. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this restaurant. The drinks are great. I had a mule with tequila that was garnished with cilantro. Wow! The food is bomb too. Go for the ribs! Service was not lacking in any way."}
{"text":"First time in Scottsdale and my friend took me here for lunch. Food was absolutely amazing!!  We split the Heirloom Tomatoes and the Strawberry Kale Salad with Salmon. The ambiance was great. Love the decor and vibe...even at lunch. The highlight, however, was Lukas...our server. Adorable, smart, accommodating, knowledgeable, brilliant all around!!  He is what made my friend come back and I would sit in his section if at all possible.  Also, try the pretzel buns and homemade chips. My friend was raving!"}
{"text":"Culinary genius . Atmosphere was buzzy but I had a slight suspicion that it was for the food and it sure was. I found out this man that owns this restaurant has an empire of them . The reason being the food is simply done they way a hearty chief with soul Intended.  It's amazing the salad ouef and then the double cheeseburger , have u wonder what a macdonalds cheeseburger would taste like if the ingredients were real and fresh? Fresh? Fluffy? - we'll this is the winner, I was moaning amazballs. Yyyyyyuuuuuummmmmiiiii"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito was really good and my friend enjoyed her bacon infused bloody mary. The view is nice if you're sitting outside and facing the pool. The slight breeze was offset by a nearby fire pit."}
{"text":"I loved the vegetarian options here, including the Sweet Corn Cannelloni. That was amazing. I think there was white asparagus involved, but I can't be sure. Regardless, I think the prices are a bit high, but I'll put up with it for more of that amazing goodness. 

Love the atmosphere and comfy chairs as well. 

It's not often my husband and I can BOTH find a place we agree on. 

Visited twice, once when we first moved to AZ with my hubby's new co-workers, and once later as a family. Both times were great. 

I did not give it 5 stars because I think although service was adequate, it should have been better."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is the perfect gastropub feel without having to leave the strip. An eclectic menu for all tastes and a killer drink menu. The Sunday brunch is the mecca of all their offerings but with its location by hard rock pool you can enjoy the relaxing atmosphere any day you choose."}
{"text":"Love this place-music some nights --try the apple salad"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food!  

My wife and I were desperate for some good eats, but nothing too fancy.  We used to go to Johnny Small's at the Hard Rock, but took a chance on this restaurant.  We sat at the bar and had the best happy hour food we've had in a long time.  The draft beer was 3 dollars a mug (note, not just domestic... draft), and we got Grilled Cheese Sliders, Smoked Salmon Bruschetta, Kobe Beef on a Stick, Antipasto, and it all came in under 40 bucks!  Amazing wait staff, great bar staff, and this place is now officially on our top eats list when we're visiting in Vegas.

Thank you guys for such an excellent culinary experience!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  They have a real antipasti menu, awesome pretzel bites and home made chips, and a delicious crispy shrimp Caesar salad loaded with TENDER fried shrimp.  It can get erally crowded, causing long waits and can also be very loud, but i highly recommend checking it out!!"}
{"text":"Get the turkey pastrami!! It's a little messy but you will thank me! It has coleslaw which I don't like but loved it on this sandwich. It comes on warm soft pretzel bread and is just amazing!!"}
{"text":"I love fox restaurant concepts and so I wanted to love/ like Culinary Dropout. Overall I was not impressed. My husband and I stopped in for a random lunch in the middle of the day. Service was slow and lacking attentiveness. The food was average bar food. I loved the ambience and overall décor. It does have a yard to \"play\" in with cornhole, horse shoes and other fun group games. I think it would be a fun place for happy hour or if a group is meeting up before a night on the town. We had the house made brats, the pretzels & fondue (was cold & unimpressive), and the Italian grinder. I might try this place again for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Went there last night to see Phil Stendek perform live music while me and my 8 yr old ate a great vegetarian meal. The staff were amazing! I had a great young gentlemen with beautiful tattoos and an awesome personality. I recommend the pretzel bites and the salted caramel pie for dessert. So yummy and thank you to everyone that made it an awesome place to spend time with my mini. Loved the live music, good vibes :)"}
{"text":"Listen, in Tempe it's a challenge to find the \"whole package\" in a single restaurant but Culinary Dropout in Tempe at The Yard IS just that. A unicorn in an area of Tempe that caters to college kids. Excellent multi-use space - we had dinner on a Tues night when the lights were low and the place was hopping and went back for lunch on a Saturday when the bright sunshine poured in - high quality service and food BOTH times. The staff were friendly and seemed to really like working there. They knew the menu and were genuinely proud of the food coming out of that kitchen. I recommend Culinary Dropout at The Yard enthusiastically!"}
{"text":"Ribs were good but not thoroughly warmed through. Fish and chips great but not a really generous portion. The cider was welcome and the coke kept coming. All good after a very long drive through Death Valley. The live music made a food background to the food."}
{"text":"We tried to find this place last time we were in town but failed.  So glad we tried again.  Got there early, got a great seat outside.  They were awesome with our son and made sure we knew about the off menu kids items.  Our server (Haley?) was great with him as well and very attentive.  The food was solid and the beer selection as well.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING! The wait staff is extremely helpful and knows the menu quit well. Every recommendation that was made to us came out timely and tasted great. I loved the Thai chili wings!"}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere.  The inside is just as fun as the outside.  I found the staff to be friendly and their style complimented the vibe.   Great place for drinks, and the delicious food always helps after a few.  Definitely left full and happy. I started with the the grilled asparagus, then the pub burger and finished with their version of monkey bread."}
{"text":"Absolute blast!!! Try the pretzel bites with fondue, they're amazing. Also their burgers are great. Drinks are a little pricey, but great. Also, they have games(ping pong, corn hole, etc.) Definitely a fun hangout with friends."}
{"text":"Good food, prices, atmosphere and super staff!  Starters are huge (wish I had room for dessert)!  I had to send my ribs back to the kitchen because of the low temperature, but they took care of it quickly.  Love the concept and location.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Aside from feeling like a carbon copy clone whenever I eat here, the food is good and it has a mix of casual and professional. In that aspect it is definitely unique."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!  The food is EXCELLENT, the service fantastic, and the atmosphere very fun.  If  you are in Phoenix, make this part of your plans."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! We got seated immediately, had great service and wonderful meal. I've never had a breakfast so beautifully platted in such a fun atmosphere. 
Check out the Cap'n Crunch French toast, it's amazing"}
{"text":"I was wish there was more stars as this place was AMAZING!
Our night at Culinary Dropout happened by chance, however our experience was absolutely perfect! We were lead outside and so pleasantly surprised by the charming decor and comfy couches.  However that was just the beginning :)
Kate was waitress in training, we were completely charmed as she sat down next to us and covered the menu and made some amazing suggestions from the delicious menu.  Not to be out done here comes Ben to cover the cocktails and boy howdy they were good. (Room Service Please)  The toasted bread with drizzles of heaven mixed with the garlic goat cheese XOXOX  I could go on and on about the entire staff and the amazing service as it was like being in your best friends backyard but no one had to do dishes.  In addition to all the amazing food and staff it was my birthday and once again they made me feel like I was definitely celebrating at home!  Here is to team Kate and Ben!   My only regret is that this two weeks to write :(

{"text":"This review is based on their fried chicken meal.

I love fried chicken.  I just love it.  This place has many highly rated online reviews.  I rarely get to eat fried chicken, so when I do, I want to savor the best.  The dish cost $22, which although it's high in price for fried chicken, I understand being in the Hard Rock Hotel carries a premium on everything. The dinner comes with a fresh made buttermilk biscuit, mashed potatoes w/gravy, slaw and half of a chicken cut up and fried.

Let me remind you, I absolutely love fried chicken.  I came during lunch, mid week, with about 4 tables sat in the venue, so it was not busy.  My chicken was either cooked too long and burnt, or the grease was very old.  After years of experience with fried chicken, I'm going to say the oil was old.  The batter they use is very light in flavor and spices. The chicken breast had many small broken bones, which I'm assuming came from where the wing was attached.  You don't get the wing, by the way.  The portion size for the breast, thigh and leg were all very small.  Such a disappointing fried chicken experience. 

The buttermilk biscuit was doughy instead of flaky.  I was unable to enjoy it.  It had too much butter in the middle which made it even more dense.  The mashed potatoes had a very stale gravy flavoring.  Even the lemon in my drink was cut the previous day.  Nothing like getting a drink with a very old and dried lemon wedge to remind you that you're not enjoying fresh food.  When a restaurant cuts back by saving garnishes for the day, they are focused on the wrong thing....customer satisfaction and enjoyment.  A case of lemons in these hotels cost around $25 for approx 200 lemons.  A standard Sunkist 8 wedge fruit cutter will yield appros 1600 lemon slices per case, or $0.015 cents per wedge.  Even if you save just 50 slices a day, you've only saved 78 cents, and at the expense of pissing off 50 customers. 

The server and managers were both very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing vibe. Love that they have a ton of couches for seating - definitely sit outside if you have opportunity. The handcrafted shandies are also worth a try. We're from out of town, but if we lived here we would be regulars for sure."}
{"text":"Probably some of the worst service I've ever had. After being seated and waiting over 20 minutes to get a server to acknowledge us, I finally asked if someone was assigned to the area we were sitting. One waiter finally assured meThat someone was coming. No one came. I finally caught the attention of two servers and asked if they wanted us to leave. Finally our drink order was taken. A third server brought our drinks and hurried without asking or taking our order. Finally a fourth pleasant woman came and apologized, took our order and treated us very well the rest of our time there. She Comp'd most of our bill, which I was pleasantly surprised. I would have bumped this up to three stars except for when I was leaving I decided to use the restroom. For a nice establishment it was completely atrocious. Toilet paper everywhere and wipes on the floor empty toilet paper rolls in the stall. I'm not looking for things to be picky about but at this point all I can think to myself as if I was the owner of this establishment I would be horrified with my staff. Decent food great ambience really cool concept terrible staff."}
{"text":"Delicious food with a twist! - Yes it's in the hard rock so it not easily accessible to locals but it worth the drive. Prices aren't' that bad and great decor and ambiance."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for a girlfriends birthday. Food was great. Our server was attentive but it did take a while to get our food and drinks.
I highly recommend the soft pretzels with fondue, so yummy! Everyone enjoyed their entrees. I had the Sweet Corn Cannelloni; the flavors were very rich and I was happy to see they had several vegetarian options. We also got to choose a complimentary desert, and had the Monkey Bread. Sounded so-so but was delicious. Also, I love decor! Comfy chairs, that are different at every table and the gorgeous chandeliers make it feel very upscale.
My only complaints would be the amount of time we waited to get our food/drinks, it was pretty loud, a bit too dark, and the portions were fairly small for the price."}
{"text":"DO NOT come here looking for good food. It's equivalent to Applebee's, maybe worse. The atmosphere is awesome. It's a great place to drink and have fun."}
{"text":"Pricey. Great for friends to gather. Liked the fire pits. Only been once when they opened."}
{"text":"After walking around the Hard Rock for a while, my friend and I decided to grab a bite to eat here.  The atmosphere and decor is really cool, and we were lucky to sit down at a time when it wasn't busy.  We ordered off of the Happy Hour Menu, and had a lot of trouble deciding what to order since everything sounded so good.  We wanted to try a few different things to split, and started off with the Hand Cut French Fries, which were good and plentiful enough for us to share.  We also had the Smoked Salmon Bruchetta.  The bread it came with was super hard and I wasn't crazy about the salmon served with it, so I probably wouldn't order it again.  Finally, we shared the Meatloaf Sandwich, which was amazing, flavorful, and perfect for splitting.  Our waiter was extremely congenial and friendly, and even brought out a complimentary dessert, the Bourbon Black Bottom Pie.  That and the Meatloaf Sandwich are worth coming back for!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty neat for our first visit.

My husband and I stopped in at this place to try something new. The menu was pretty standard - sandwiches, burgers, salads - but the antipasto menu was kinda of unique, or the combination of it all was.

We ordered the Pub Burger and Shaved Prime Rib sandwich, they were both pretty good, but a little pricey for what it was ($15 for a sandwich!!).

The decor was pretty interesting, kinda dark for night time but the chandeliers were absolutely beautiful!

The staff were attentive and almost overly informative on the food (couldn't hurt right). The place had a nice vibe and mixed crowd. Definitely a place to stop by for their awesome summer happy hour specials!

Overall 4 stars for good food and service."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, excellent service, expensive food and drinks. Tried the ramen and was disappointed - noodles were undercooked, eggs were too soft, tonkotsu broth was way off."}
{"text":"This place had a really cool vibe, and a great beer selection.  The food was really fresh and inventive.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone passing through Old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Brugos Pizza is one very special restaurant...the food is DELICIOUS and the ambience spectacular....it is one of our \"Must Go to\" restaurants when we visit Scottsdale...and we are very picky especially about our \"Italian Food\"!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC, AMAZING,WONDERFUL just some of the adjectives  I use to describe my recent experience at this place! I can't rave enough on our AMAZING SERVER GRACE!! I've lived in AZ for four years and she is THE BEST WAITRESS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD IN ARIZONA! She's so sweet,personable,professional, and polite! My respects to whomever raised this beautiful lady! She was PERFECT . There's not one thing I would change she made my experience amazing! FABULOUS FOOD and DRINKS were epic! I literally adore this place! Hats off to you all, especially grace! I hope higher management recognizes such talent as this amazing young lady grace! We have become regulars!"}
{"text":"Overall good experience and met expectations.  Highlights were the pretzel fondue appetizer. Our entrees the Cubano and turkey pastrami were solid B plus to A minus. Good atmosphere and good service. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Spent a casual afternoon in the area and decided to stop by Culinary Dropout for a light bite and a glass o wine. Weekday afternoon - not busy at all. We decided on a seat outdoors. Our server brought out the menu, took our drink order and we asked for a few more minutes to fill out the fun \"sushi-like\" menu to design our very own antipasti. Waited a really long time for our server to return, my hubby had to go chase down the waiter. We finally ordered one meat, one cheese, some grilled asparagus and bread and olive oil. TONS of bread and very little of everything else. Not great or over the top ingredients - we could have done better at AJ's or Whole Foods. All in all, very poor service and more talk than walk on the food. Don't think we'll go back to try anything else as it was pricey for what we got and again, the service sukt."}
{"text":"Food was good,Chx noodle soup, mussels and grinder... On the other hand inattentive service, took over 10 minutes for a bartender to greet us, mind you there were at least 4 ppl behind the bar, not busy,unwelcoming staff and no knowledge on whisky selection ... Very disappointed, poor service .... Staff worried about their looks vs service ....\"too cool for school \"...Will not be back !"}
{"text":"We would definitely come back and I was lobbying to go back sooner than later since we had such a great time out with our friends (who are also family). Great food, great drink, and a great time!

It is Valet parking only or you need to park across the street. When you come in, they ask for your cell phone number and txt you when your table is ready. they also immediately send you a link to see your position in line on a web page. It was really cool.

WAIT TIME:

On a Saturday night the wait was about 45 min for the six of us. We went out the the giant patio area and walked right up to an empty table. I think they are hard to come by, but we lucked out.  We had a drink or two before being seated. 

BAR:

I think the bar part is called, \"The Yard\" and the restaurant is called Culinary Dropout? I didn't pay that close of attention and there was actually a third area that looked like a sushi bar. This place is huge and made up of 3 or 4 distinct areas. 

There are games under the giant patio in the Yard, such as ping pong, corn-hole and shuffleboard, but we did not play any. they all looked busy and we were fine just talking.  

There is a small bar behind the games, but they only have 3 beers on tap and a few in cans, so we went to the main bar to get more choices...and they do have a TON of choices. you can also get a Brown Bag Special, which is basically they give you a beer like Hamms or Bush in a paper bag. Kind of funny, but I prefer Kilt Lifter, which they have along with a lot of other great beers. A really great thing about this place is the patio area is so big, you can get a drink and don't have to be standing shoulder to shoulder with other people like seems to be the norm at other trendy restaurants. 

The crowd ranges from teens to 50+, but certainly most are in the 20's and 30's.  Us, being in our 40's still fit in.  I suppose it would be ok to bring younger children, but there were none there. ...actually, I did see a woman walking a baby around. We also ran into a friend's teenage children, but I do not recall any other. 

RESTAURANT:

The restaurant was very nice. They had a live band that sounded great and was not too loud. We all tried each others food and we like it all. We were really impressed at how great the food was. 

FOOD:

The Pretzel fondue was to die for. A MUST have! 
The meatloaf was better than my mom's!  (Sorry mom.)
My wife and I shared the Pastrami Turkey (Turkey with seasonings on the outside like beef pastrami) with coleslaw on a pretzel bun. I would definitely get that again. REALLY good.
The mussels were just \"OK\". Not great, but not bad. The bread that came with them was really good."}
{"text":"Nice place. The food is good but nothing sensational. Compared to the rest of the Hard Rock offers its a five star but the rest of the brunch offers are terrible. 
Friendly and competent staff!"}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of all the staff! Everyone was alive with energy, the waitresses wore cute little dresses, the waiters were all boy band like! Not a place to take your kids in the pm hours , but you are coming to drink, and eat right?
. This is a trendy, fun, chic little spot. Great drink menu and an amazing selection of meats and cheeses to nosh on. The black mussels,, to die for!  i was so full I did not even get to try an entree which means we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good! Our servers seem to have a conflict with each other that made our experience feel a little weird.

The host sat us down and explained the menu to me, but when our server came a few minutes later, she wanted to explain the menu as well. We told her that the host had already done so and she seemed to be offended. Rubbed me the wrong way and made me feel uncomfortable, but the rest of the evening was fun."}
{"text":"This was a decent place and the waitress was nice and attentive. The food was fresh and my wife enjoyed her seared tuna salad with wasabi peas. The fondue with the pretzels was fine but not great. I ordered the fried chicken and was told it was as good as Babes Chicken in Texas. This comparison almost rang true until I got to my second piece of chicken which was undercooked. I just put it to the side and had it for lunch the next day. I never return food but that's me. Not too sure if I would visit again but if it wasn't for the chicken surprise I would have given 4 stars."}
{"text":"My friend had been there previously and did not have a good dining experience.  She had talked to the manager to let her know.  The manager and chef brought several dishes and appetizers to sample. Such as a steak dinner, shrimp, chicken kabobs, salmon bruschetta, marinated asparagus and Brussel sprouts devil eggs etc.. Etc...  Everything was absolutely delicious!!  The service was impeccable.  Our sever had a great personality and sense of humor as well.  It was an evening to remember???"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick dinner, this is not the place to go. I waited an hour just to be seated. But on this current friday night (1/9/15), when i was finally seated, it was by one of the most down to earth and genuine waitress, her name was Bri, she was absolutely adorable, always smiling, very attentive and cared about our needs. i went into this restaurant irritated and annoyed but after being taken care of by our waitress i left wanting to come back. The food was great and having the experience of a great waitress made up for the wait. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The little lady and I went to this location for a great late lunch and honestly I really liked the place. The service personnel was friendly and knowledgeable, and I thought the food was really good ;) The atmosphere was very calming, mostly because it was before the dinner rush. The restaurant was very clean and the long both seats were comfortable.

My shaved brisket dip sandwich was excellent, and the fries were amazing. I didn't have any alcoholic beverages so I cannot speak to their quality. 

The hummus appetizer was pretty good, the pita has a very nice light spongy texture but the hummus itself needed a bit more salt.

My wife wasn't as impressed as I was, she didn't like the corn in the salad she had, and thought her pasta was mostly raw and had a weird texture to it.

I'd recommend this place based on the really good food ans service I had and if you're into live music, they have it on Wednesday's, Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. We visited just prior to the LV Rockin Roll Marathon. We had a very large group, but service was good."}
{"text":"Second time we came here, first time was just for drinks.  Typical fox concept feel, but the food was downright gross.  Our whole party all tried different food, and now everyone feels half sick.  Would never go back to eat.  Service straight up munches pork butt, that and some indigestion and you have a culinary GED."}
{"text":"What an amazing atmosphere and the food was great. Their fried chicken is out of this world with a hint of honey I never expected."}
{"text":"I go there for food and not really for the *fun* so I may not be experiencing the best of this place, but it still earns my 4 stars. Nice decor, good service and good (but not great) foods. Definitely a place to go with your friends, family members and co-workers."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but sadly, it was a disappointment. The food was so-and-so, and service was slow despite the place being almost empty. This place is inside the Hard Rock Casino, which is being remodeled. Hopefully, once the remodeling is finished and the restaurant gets more traffic they will shape up, but until then - avoid."}
{"text":"Took 4 of my best friends here for the first time tonight, and they really enjoyed themselves... Our server was amazing, she made sure everyone was happy and really went out of her way for us. My friends loved the atmosphere and were so happy to be apart of the trendy vibe going on. I love this place and I was so happy to share this amazing experience with my friends. I would highly recommend this place for honestly any occasion. I cannot wait for my family to visit to take them here. Thank you so much Culinary Dropout team for such a great night!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, BUT I detest that the parking lot is by valet ONLY!!! I have a handicap placard and I asked the valet guy if I could park myself in a handicap place myself. He said No. Isn't he the guy who parked them there in the first place???? It's ridiculous. Anyway, great atmosphere and good food. The bartender there Annie was super nice."}
{"text":"I don't think I will be coming back to this place. We come to spring training every year and last year when we came it was fun and services was pretty good - tonight my husband asked me where I wanted to go on our last night here in Tempe and I said \"let's go back to culinary dropout,\" boy mistake. We should have gone to four peaks brewery. Better service and food and not jerked around. Plus can't get the game we want to see...ugh!!!"}
{"text":"One star for service.  My husband and I obviously do not fit the demographic of who they think are worthy of service....but after flagging down assistance after about 25 minutes we ordered the pretzels....these were very good (four stars on the pretzels.  We also got an Italian chopped salad which consisted primarily of garbanzo beans which were good but the salad was 60% beans....very little meat and cheese.  We also had fish and chips which was like and bad bar food anywhere........We had to beg for service, beg to get our bill,  were never asked if we wanted another drink ( we did)  had to chase down someone to take our money after we did get our bill.  Meantime, all the young beauties around us were getting served and service.

Note to management...do not discriminate against people who may be older than your usual demographic....We have money :-)."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Fast and friendly service is just the beginning.  The food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"If this review were just about food, Culinary Dropout would get a respectable rating.
Parking is a hassle.  It's nice to park and walk into a restaurant without the annoying valet parking.  The killer:  NOISE.  The afternoon dining experience was awful.  Live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting in order to converse.  People in a restaurant want to speak to each other, but at this restaurant, don't bother.  The management explained that they like this idea--drown out conversation. We celebrated a friend's birthday there.  They have a nice menu with a wide selection of soups, salads, sandwiches, and main entrees.  Very interesting variety.  Lots of good craft beer choices.  If this place was quiet enough for us to carry out conversation, we might try it.  But the noise is too much.  We checked with some friends---same observation.  If you like the \"buzz\" of a loud restaurant and valet parking, this place is for you.  Sure not for us."}
{"text":"One star for the atmosphere besides that the food was really bad I got the grilled cheese sliders and they were just plain gross. The cheese was nasty and tastes like it was fried in old grease. Harsh I know."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Atmosphere was above average. Service was good. 

There was nothing bad or wrong with this place. But in a city where standing out is not easy to do, this place was run of the mill. Would I be back...if I was staying in the hotel then I'd definitely be back. If I was not near this place, I wouldn't drive out of my way. 

Again, good but not great."}
{"text":"Food is great, drinks are great, vibe is great, Jade is great--seriously, ask for her, she's ridiculously nice and knows everything. I got the ribeye cap and my friend got the salmon our first time there; the next time, we switched because they were so good. The trout looked really good too. As for drinks, I'm normally a bourbon girl, but Jade turned me on to tequila with the soiled dove. When they recommend the banana cream pie at the end, take it; you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful evening at Culinary dropout!  Sat on the patio with a good friend, an incredible lobster bisque, crusty bread, and a nice buttery Chardonnay. Perfect!!"}
{"text":"I love the friend chicken and the fun cocktails, but mostly I enjoy the vibe. They've done a great job creating a swank atmosphere, and I like knowing that I can always go and grab a drink at the back bar while I wait for my table. A fantastic place to bring friends for an entire evening of drinks, booze, and maybe some games. I think the food is mostly solid, but you're not coming necessarily for a \"culinary\" experience. You're coming for the vibe. And it's a good one."}
{"text":"Just go! Get the pretzels. They are amazing! The service is wonderful. Everyone is extremely friendly and welcoming. Everything I ate blew my mind. Culinary Dropout is the best meal and dining experience I have had in Vegas, maybe even ever!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for appetizers and drinks. The pretzel bites with cheese fondue are amazing! My drink was good too...it was a champagne sangria. Our service was amazing as well. The prime rib sandwich was very good too. I got mine to go since I had an appetizer. Everybody at our table was happy with our food and service. I plan to go back."}
{"text":"was here on a monday evening recently with a friend, ordered a lot of munhchie foods...charcuterie, deviled eggs, asparagus and wine on the patio. very pleasant, tasty and great service."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Great food and excellent service especially if Evan is your server, he was amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was my second trip here. Food is excellent but the service is really bad (both trips). I sat at the bar to eat and drink and the bartenders were mostly on it even though they don't know who anyone is and have to ask each time you order a drink what your last name is since they have so many tabs and have no idea who you are (they take your card on the first order). My biggest gripe was that they brought my entree with my soup so I asked to have it come out later after I ate my soup. The girl who was the runner tonight couldn't even find me when she brought out my soup. I needed people around me to call her back to give me my soup. Oh and they never brought me my entree. I would love to know where my meatloaf went. To the management at CD, I won't come back to eat again."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. The food was mediocre. Shaved Prime Rib Dip ($18) was a standard ($8) French Dip anywhere else in America, French fries were cold and rubbery. A friend had Beer Battered Fish and Chips and was equally disappointed. The high prices reflect the high overhead of the place and not better food ingredients. We'll not be returning."}
{"text":"THREE-AND-ONE-HALF STARS.

We were in Phoenix and wanted to catch a movie but needed to eat something other than styrofoam with yellow oil on it (movie popcorn), so we stuck our heads in this crowded restaurant and explained to the hostess/supermodel that we needed to be hasty and she found us a table and the waitress took our steak orders right away.  The steaks were good, we ate and were on our way.  Everything sorta fell into place; we were impressed.  Also it looked as if there was backline set up for a band maybe playing later that night.

How boring is THIS review?

Anyway, only been here once, want to try it again when I am in the vicinity, and have the time to relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great visit. We sat outside during our visit and got to enjoy the live show!

Two things I came to Yelp about. First is the Soft Pretzels & Provolone. DUDE! Completely worth it! They were even good reheated. True story!
Second I must rave about the service that Felicia provided. What an experience! She is what I hope for everytime I visit a restaurant. Great service, great personality and completely knowledgable of the menu and made great suggestions. 
I can guarantee my return for the pretzels and I will definitely request Ms. Felicia! Me and my lady were completely impressed with everything.

If you're thinking about going, I hope that this review will convince you that it is totally worth a shot."}
{"text":"This place has great food, great beer and a great atmosphere. However, the service was not so great. My husband and I waited a while to be served. Other than that, everything was wonderful. Happy Hour is the way to go, otherwise, it would be a little pricey for the food. Get the pretzels and fondue, that was amazing!!"}
{"text":"We were told 30 minutes. 1:45 later, we left without being seated or updated.

Multiple large groups exited. Tables that were seated after we arrived finished and left before anyone notified us of anything.

We learned afterward by calling two managers that they had given away our table twice while we were waiting."}
{"text":"I was at the Hard Rock when the hunger monster started gnawing at my insides so I decided to stroll into the Culinary Dropout for a drink and some food. I sat at the bar where I was greeted by Matt the bartender. He was knowledgeable and moved lightening fast making drinks for not only myself but everyone at the bar and in the restaurant. 

I ordered the pretzels and cheese dip. Although the pretzels were a bit salty, they were still enjoyable. I also ordered the pulled pork nachos which were on happy hour special...SCORE!!! The pork was tender and juicy. If you love chocolate, ask for the chocolate bottom pie. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"There is nothing not to like here.  Must try the fondue pretzels.   Sit at the bar if you can for good interaction and people watching."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3 or 4 stars. Five for ambiance -- great building with a modern rustic feel. Love the bar. Fire pits, an eclectic mishmash of chairs, great lighting, shuffleboard, ping pong -- a cool vibe. Great for happy hour or to watch a game as there are a ton of TVs. The crowd is more on the young side and feels kind of Scottsdale like. It gets very very very crowded, so if you want to get a table get there early. The food is eh. Not bad, but not great. But also not overly priced so I guess it balances itself out. They also have love music on weekends which is a plus!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and bar, and also a great outdoor seating area. Loved the pretzels and fondue.  I ordered the fried chicken.  I was disappointed when it came out with cole slaw, which wasn't mentioned on the menu.  It wasn't in its own little cup and had leaked mayonnaise all over the plate.  So the chicken and biscuit were all soggy on the bottoms.  Chicken also seemed under seasoned and generally lacked flavor.  Also- some staff were dressed really inappropriately (daisy dukes that showed the bottom of butt cheeks).  That was rather unappetizing.  Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Yum! The Dolls love the pretzels, tuna salad, and the cute waiters!!"}
{"text":"Great staff to serve as your menu and libation sherpa - which is definitely needed. 

Had a few of the signature dishes - pretzels (not enough cheese for all the pretzels), ribs, fried chicken and salted carmel pudding. All were good with interesting flavores but the fried chicken and carmel pudding with caramel popcorn on top were by far the best. The mashed p's and gravy were marginal. 

The drinks were great - creative ingredients and names. Went for lunch so can't comment about crowd and volume but the decor is pretty sweet so would definitely want to come back for the evening partay."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the CD  concept and for good reason: they make some of the best sandwiches/Entrees/Salads  for lunch  in Tempe . It's gotta be tough to carve out a niche amongst the tough restaurant competition in Tempe, but CD has done it, and done it well.

They have a good menu of sandwiches and Entrees available, including burgers, cold cuts, hot sandwiches, and vegetarian options. You can find down-home staples right next to globally-inspired experiments, and it's all delicious. 

One of their staples is the meatloaf, which is great. Thick, crusty,  Its Tomato topped with a thick slab of griddled meatloaf, beans, and  sauce. It's a mouthful, and it's great. Not for the faint of heart . 
Service from the minute I walked in were on it , from Chris who sat me to Victoria my waitress who was very professional and atentive going as the extra step and bringing me a great cup of coffee  .
Sam Fox has another winner on his hands ."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing food. People who truly care about quality and creativity. Will be eating here again on our next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"Just left here, and I will never go back. I've been to Culinary Dropout at this location many times and had good experiences. Not this time. As my mom and I walk in, the girl working there immediately asks what name is down for the reservation. I had to stop myself from laughing as the place was DEAD. At 4 pm on a Saturday there's about 6 tables of people. We told her we didn't have any and she says \"I have a table outside but I'll need it back by 5:15.\" It's too cold to eat outside, literally NO ONE is eating outside. We tell her we want a table inside and she contemplates this as if it's the hardest task she's ever been dealt. She tells us there's an open table (wow really???) but she'll need it back by 5:15 for people who DO have reservations. Keep in mind, the place is dead. We tell her fine and as I'm sitting down at the table she goes \"now remember I'll need this table back by 5:30 at the latest.\" At this point, I was ready to tell the bimbo off. The service was slow, the restaurant was freezing, and we were rushed by multiple waiters. One wait came and asked me if I wanted a box after about 10 minutes and I asked him if he could give me a honey mustard to go and he literally TAKES MINE WHILE IM STILL EATING and puts it in a to go container. What the fuck????? This isn't some cheap restaurant. I was also pretty aggravated by this idiot who again seats another family while reminding them they need to leave. The waitress took about 5 minutes to initially come to our table so we told her we were on a time crunch via the hostess. She seemed very confused by this and went and talked to he hostess. The father and daughter next to us heard this and said they were also told at 3:30 when they arrived they'd need to leave by 5. I've NEVER had a hostess or waiter tell me I needed to leave a restaurant before, especially before I ever sat down. I don't believe for one second all of the tables were reserved and if they were, it's not uncommon for someone with reservations to wait 5-10 minutes after arrival. If you can't figure out how to time your tables and treat customers who are paying highly inflated prices at your hipster restaurant, you shouldn't be working in the restaurant industry. Not to mention this was my mom and I's birthday dinner, but ya know, the waitstaff is more preoccupied on the customers who aren't even there yet."}
{"text":"I just can't get behind Culinary Dropout.  In my opinion, they're overpriced and the food is meh.  We went for brunch the other day and their brunch menu was quite limited.  My husband had two beers at $8 each, which I think is ridiculous.  My sandwich wasn't very good and the soup that came with it left much to be desired, as well.  I will not be coming back here to eat."}
{"text":"Small portions...very, very small. Pricey for what you get. Decent quality but usually under staffed in the kitchen so the wait time can be extreme. Better location on Phoenix, but as this one is close to work end up here with co-workers."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour during a week day. I like the relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff. Happy hour menu was a bit smaller than what I anticipated. But the amount of food we got and the quality of the food was fantastic. 

Pretzel and Fondue was a okay. But the amount of pretzel rolls we got was totally worth the buck. Chips with onion dips was the best chips I have ever had. It was crispy, fresh, and non-greasy. It was refreshing to see how little oil was absorbed to the wax paper. Onion dip was not amazing but goes well with the chips. Grill cheese sliders was decent. But not amazing compare to the pretzel and the chips. The biggest disappointment would be the Korean Chicken and Shrimp. Portion was small, flavor was nothing Korean, and the presentation was just not appealing. 

Over all we had a great time and will likely to return to try other regular menu items."}
{"text":"A big group of us ate here: it was a friends reunion and we couldn't have chosen a more perfect restaurant. 

We booked through OpenTable and I left a few notes saying that we wanted to be seated outside, and that we had some gluten-intolerant attendees. We walked in, and they immediately sat us outside, and provided gluten-free menus. 

The server was such a sweetie, and gave us our time to chat and catchup. We definitely overstayed our welcome, but they were kind to let us sit after we had finished our dinner. 

Next time we're in Arizona, we will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, however, the prices are a little inflated. Probably has to do with location. It is a really large place, we were there on a Friday, it gets pretty crowded. Because of how large it is sometimes you feel the staff may have forgotten about you."}
{"text":"Very hip, spacious & group friendly hang out place.  Interesting menu & wide array of drink selections. I liked the fried chicken, strawberry milk, yogurt parfait, smoked salmon... pretty much the whole menu."}
{"text":"I ate at CDO about a year ago and i remember it being much better.  I had their amazing Brussels spouts stuck in my head when i made my reservations to come again. Well, apparently CDO only serves Brussels sprouts seasonally-so sad!  We ordered nachos and pretzels with cheese fondue. Both appetizers had the same fondue cheese, which I thought was gross. It was clearly made with american cheese, as it tasted like Velveeta. The nacho were super salty as was the salmon entree. The salmon was very disappointing since I had the salmon last night at olive and ivy and it was one of the best I ever had!  On the positive side, service was friendly, atmosphere is lots of fun and my husband had the Italian chopped salad and said it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Not bad, but just an over hyped, over priced Scottsdale restaurant. The sad part is I did not have to pay for this meal, it was with my company, but $17 for a french dip? maybe they had to pay the import taxes to get it in the country. It was a good sandwich, but nothing that I cant get in other places. The pretzel fondue was a pleasant change and rather tasty. Our waitress was very nice, and they did not let the cups get empty..maybe you pay for the service because the food is good, but not so good that my life cant continue without it."}
{"text":"Love the one in Phoenix but the service here is horrible. Waited 40 minutes for table (mind you they were not busy) I received a text at 3:25 that the table was ready and didn't even get seated until 3:40. I asked to speak with a manager ... James came over and apologized and said he would make sure the food came fast. I was in the service industry for 5 years he could have at least offered an appetizer or small discount. I love Fox Restaurant but I will never come back to this location. They were more than staffed to handle this volume and they seriously need to get it together. I witnessed two other complaints."}
{"text":"Have the pretzel bites with the fondue, you won't regret it!! Love coming here and having drinks and apps with friends."}
{"text":"We live in Phoenix and have visited all 3 culinary dropout AZ locations. And this one was been just as great! What a wonderful night! They have a wide variety of drinks and entrees, something for everyone! Our server Ben was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. Get the fried Chicken, you will not regret it :) when in Las Vegas eat at Culinary Dropout!"}
{"text":"Rating it strictly for Happy Hour. Pretzels with fondue was mediocre at best and despite only costing $6, not worth it.  I'd prefer a smaller portion with higher quality fondue.  The salmon bruschetta was akin to tuna fish smear on overly thick bread coupled with a pale out of season tomato, some capers and marinated red onion.  Poor balance on flavors to say the least.  HH wasn't enough to lure me into ordering dinner."}
{"text":"Went there for Father's Day....and a place that I have been wanting to go to for awhile.  Several friends of ours have gone and highly recommended the honey drizzle chicken...and OMG! It is the best restaurant fried chicken that I have ever had!  We also had the beef stroganoff which was very tasty and started the whole meal off with the soft pretzels with provolone cheese....WOW! What an appetizer!  Can't wait to return to try other stuff on their menu!"}
{"text":"Went for a dinner meeting on a Thursday, sat in 'the Yard' and overall it was a fine experience.

Pros: We were seated right away. Waiter was very nice and perfect attentiveness timing. The antipasti was yummy and fun, we could have kept ordering off it and nibbling all evening. Parking had to be valet but it was very quick and efficient. 

Cons: Too loud for having a business meeting. Entrees were slightly better than average. 

I would go back with friends and hangout in the couches or play in the game area."}
{"text":"Another creative restaurant from the people at Fox.  Love the meatballs and mussels.  Cool vibe although some might find it a bit too hipster for their taste.  You can be waiting quite a bit on the wrong weekend night and the bar can feel a bit cramped if you decide and wait to have a drink there.  Only given 4 stars because there is such tremendous competition in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying WOW! We had the fried chicken, shaved prime rib sandwich, and the Korean rybeie cap. All three were to die for! Cooked perfectly. And the homemade ranch dressing?! Spot on chefs, spot on! Shout out to Gean and Marlo awesome managers who made sure we were having the best experience we possibly could. If you haven't been here yet you are missing out!"}
{"text":"First time here last night. I liked the atmosphere. We started with the pretzels and cheese fondue - it was really good. Then I got the grilled cheese sliders. To be honest, I wasn't a huge fan. They have tomato and bacon on them but I wasn't fond of the cheese they use. The fries were good though. Other entrees chosen were the smoked salmon - my friend raved about it, the chicken club - it was huge and on a yummy pretzel bun, and the turkey pastrami - also on a pretzel bun and pretty tasty. I saw another table near us getting the fried chicken and I think that's what I'll try next time I go. It looked really good. Oh I almost forgot, we ended with the salted caramel custard. It's topped with some caramel corn. It was really rich but very good. I definitely wouldn't be able to eat it all myself because it's so rich so you might think about sharing it.  Or maybe you can handle it and would want to keep it all to yourself :)"}
{"text":"Great experience!!  From the trendy decor to the excellent service to the great food.  We will certainly be going back.  I had the Meatloaf which tasted amazingly like my Mom's.  Another member of our party had the Nacho's which were so huge he couldn't even finish.  A third member had the Sweet Corn Ravioli which he characterized as \"having a party in his mouth\".  We also had the Kale salad which was excellent.  It's a bit noisy, but that's probably only a function of being so busy at 6:00 on a Friday night.  The atmosphere was so fun at what my friend termed, \"The Land of the Pretty People\"."}
{"text":"Cool server. The place was full of Scottsdale  douchbags and way to over priced hints all the douchbags. Hey if douchbags is your thing then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Fun place to go with friends and hang out. Good food great happy hour prices."}
{"text":"I ate here 3 times in one week... THAT'S how much I love it..   I even made my bf take me here for Valentine's Day.  Which was great, because it was empty, seeing how most girls want that expensive romance crap. The ambiance reminds me of the trendy restaurants in Boston or Seattle, not pretentious....just fun and eclectic.  I am obsessed with their Kale Salad, I even make it at home. The Pumpkin ravioli was ridiculous in a really good way, the pretzels with cheese dip are addicting, ALL their Sandwiches.. ok ok you probably are now understanding how AMAZING this place is.  I think the only thing I didn't like was the music.. Rap/techno music playing way to loud... I looked around like.. umm rap/techno music at The Hard ROCK?  but it was some lame DJ probably from L.A.  'Spinning' on his Apple Laptop..Dude, it's Valentine's Day..play some Radiohead or Imagine Dragons.  I don't want to hear Bitches N Hoes mixed with Skrillix.."}
{"text":"It's like a classy version of The Duce. Fun stuff to do in the yard area. Delicious pretzel appetizer. Get a Double Blind- a random can of beer in a paper can and choose a random airplane bottle of booze. Hilarious fun.

**was told that they only take limited reservations- something like only at 6pm. Weird."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and have had sub-par meals each time.  The ramen was the best of the entrees (which was mediocre) while the chicken club sandwich was not very good. 

The one highlight of this restaurant is the soft pretzels and cheese fondue appetizer.  Absolutely delicious.  Would consider getting this as my main entree if I ever went back."}
{"text":"Cavewoman like. Me lick plate in public! Crusty bread w balsamic,  strawberry w brie and pistachios, gorgonzola. Oh ya."}
{"text":"Fiance and I wanted to take her aunt somewhere to celebrate her birthday...Beautiful day as always here in AZ so we wanted some outdoor dining...Found this place on YELP and WOW!! This place is so modern yet so relaxing, with a fun enviorment. Very well put together, nice full bar, area to play ping pong, and bags!? Cant say how much we loved it. Had a Belgium beer on tap. Great beer...Food was excellent, i had the Italian Sandwhich...very good, fiance had the beer battered fish. Very good as well, and her aunt had a burger which looked very BIG and good as well. Servers were very pretty and dressed very \"hipsterish\" according to my fiance...i just thought they looked very well dressed and beautiful girls...No dress code...I will be back soon...i do want to visit the Scottsdale one and see the difference in the people. Oh and i almost forgot...They have complementary valet VIP parking..just pull up and slide the kid a few singles on the way out."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and personalized attention from staff. Great food and upbeat clubby back ground music. Great stop."}
{"text":"Incredible place. Got the Korean rib eye cap and it was a 10/10. Our waitress was a sweetheart. So helpful with accommodating my girlfriend's vegan diet and she made our experience so pleasant. At the end, she took care of our bill as a Christmas present and we are so appreciative. Definitely check this place out! Wonderful atmosphere, kind people, great food."}
{"text":"On our tour of Fox concept restaurants this is always the first.  It's hip and dark and novel for a first date or to woo your partner.  The drinks have always been professional and crafted, I know its passé but i ask these bartenders to \"do something with gin\" and they've always impressed me.  Service is authentic and food is comforting and rich.  Prices are spot on for the Scottsdale anti-chain crowd but Fox Concepts are becoming pretty \"chain-like\" so I see a new trend emerging, hopefully from Fox."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, however the service is a bit slow. Don't go here if you are on a tight timeline :).

Great live music on Friday nights, so if you are looking for a different place, with lots going on in the background, with some good food, you should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Frankie and Christian were fantastic!
Great location for lunch, dinner, or just drinks.
Terrific  selection of app's, shared foods and entrees were wonderful.  
Frankie's service and attention to our needs for allergies was perfect.  
Make this a stop for a meal."}
{"text":"\"Bring earplugs with your tastebuds\"

We came here for my wife and mom's birthday for dinner and let's say we were not prepared for the high decibel ambiance.  We had what was recommended from Michelle L. and other reviews.  
1. Soft pretzel with provolone fondue - 4 stars.
2. 32 hour ribs - 4 stars
3. Salted caramel custard - 5 stars. 
4. Sausage and mushroom Gnocchi - 3 star

After walking in you have beautiful chandeliers and modern decor.  There is a stage for live band music which we sat in front of.  Thankfully we were finished with our meal before the band began.  We could hardly hear our waiter and he had difficult time hearing us as well.  

Although there was a good crowd in the restaurant and they didn't mind the noise level, but noise level was too high and distracting for us which the food was not able to overcome.  If the chef or owner was truly a culinary dropout, it was because he couldn't hear the instructions in class.  

If you find this review useful, funny, or cool please check accordingly."}
{"text":"Update - May 9, 2017 - I just had dinner and was blown away with the place, the food, and the service.  They far exceeded my expectations and for a very busy Tuesday night during A.S.U. graduation they did a great job seating us and making sure we were pleased with everything.  I want to thank the GM and her staff.  It is good to see that Sam is letting his employees run his business like they should be run.  I will be back to any of the Fox restaurants after tonight's experience.  

Like with most of the Sam Fox restaurants the place is lovely inside.  The menu is good and the food is fine.  The issue I have with this place and several other Sam Fox restaurants is the service.  My last visit to this location my experience started by getting the wrong size beer from the bartender, no big deal he was nice about it and changed it out for me.  The rest of my party arrived so I closed out with the bartender and he did not correct the bill for my drink.  It took me at least 15 minutes to get his attention, if it were busy I would have no issue with this time frame but it was not busy at all.  He was too busy talking with his other workmates.  When I got his attention he was able to correct his error and brought me the correct tab.  It took another 15 minutes for him to come over and pick up the cash I put out to cover the bill.  He was quick to bring my change back to me however he brought the incorrect change back.  After 20 minutes waiting to point out the error I decided the four dollars was not worth my time with my friends and family that were now waiting for me at a table.  Once I got to the table for dinner the rest of the evening was okay but still slow.  Also, I'm not sure if the staff is trained to show no emotion or not but my gosh at least pretend that you are happy to be there.  This what I will call attitude for lack of a better word seems to permeate several of the Fox Group restaurants.  I would love to give this place a better review but my experience was not a good one.  Maybe next time I will be able to update this review with a better experience."}
{"text":"Fun place for dinner/drinks. Pretzel bread w/ provolone fondue is amazing. Fried chicken is as good as it can be. Don't skip dessert! Monkey bread is out of this world."}
{"text":"Nice people, but I ordered ribs and they were cold in the middle. First bites ok, but then third rib and they weren't hot, rather cold. No Bueno. Otherwise big space and lots of regular bar menu items on tap, people having good time. Cold pork is no Bueno."}
{"text":"This place was so amazing! I heard it was pretty good and being a huge fan of comfort food i was pretty open to trying. The staff was extremely helpful when it came to picking food out. We pretty ordered everything our server suggested and just like he said, it was all mouth meltingly delicious. The best part about the restraunt other then the ombiance and and wildly delicious food was the location. It wasnt difficult to get to and pretty easy to find."}
{"text":"Like all of Sam Fox's restaurants, Culinary Dropout intrigued me enough to get me in the door to try it and pleased me at first with its nice atmosphere and friendly service, but then didn't meet expectations when it came to food and value. He seems to have a recurring pattern of great concepts with mediocre execution. The $9 grilled cheese sliders were pretty bad, with yellow American cheese like the packaged grocery store slices. For just $6, you can have a MUCH better grilled cheese sandwich at former Fox restaurant, Chloe's Corner (at Kierland Commons), and it's greater quantity, too. The $12 smoked chicken salad was quite yummy but very small. You could get equally as good salads at Chloe's Corner for $7.50. Or if you're going to spend $12, at least go across the way at Fashion Square to Grand Lux Café and get one that's big enough for a whole meal! The $7 salted carmel pot de creme was also just so-so. I almost NEVER leave any dessert uneaten, but this was just very one-dimensional and too sweet. I won't be rushing back here any time soon, but I'll probably be suckered in to trying some of Fox's other new places. I guess I'm just an optimist."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant! We are a family of 4 on vacation! Loved it! Great service great food great atmosphere! Great prices!! Hope the restaurant comes to the east coast!! Payne our server who is a LAX player for ASU was super attentive! Can't say enough good things! So happy we came here"}
{"text":"They have great happy hour deals for food and drinks especially the pretzels and cheese and the sangrias! Plenty of seating indoors. Really fun, hip atmosphere for all ages. Backyard games, like cornhole, to play outside with fans and misters, but it was still too hot for me to even want to outside, so I didn't really check it out. I only looked from the window. The only qualm I have is the small parking lot. They do have complimentary valet."}
{"text":"We went to Culinary Dropout to celebrate a friend's birthday and had a wonderful time!  We started out with the pretzels with cheese.  Everyone in the group enjoyed them immensely.  Our server was Michael, and he did an excellent job providing our group with recommendations for entrees and drinks.  I ordered the fried chicken which turned out to be fantastic!  Everyone in our group was impressed by the quality and taste of the food.  This place has a cool atmosphere and the professionalism of the staff was impressive.  The manager came over to check on us and thanked us for coming in.  If you are looking for a fun place to feast, I highly recommend checking out the Culinary Dropout!"}
{"text":"Though we only came for dessert... from the decor, to the beer list, to the Lou Reed quote on the menu, for an FRC joint... Culinary Dropout is pretty good.  

I'd wanted to try this for spot for a while and this Friday we decided to head over from the Biltmore area and stop into CD around midnight for cocktails & some dessert. 

The decor is pretty funky, awesome oversized chandeliers, cool chairs & tables & great purple wall across from the bar.  At midnight there was still a 30 min wait for a table for 2.  We scored a little table outside and a couple couch seats.  Nice. 

Granted... the location in scottsdale lends itself to a barrage of douchebaggery in and around the restaurant, but you cant expect much more when going out around here, so no surprises.  

We were pleasantly surprised when looking at the beverage list.  They had a pretty good craft brew & import beer list, both on tap and in bottles.  They also broke down their specialty cocktails by liquor which was a nice touch.  

Being a bit of a bloody mary snob, i had to try the Bacon infused vodka Bloody mary.  Normally, this isnt the time of day for this drink, but had to give it a shot.  It's nothing to write home about.  The infused vodka is good, but the it wasnt even served with Olives, i had to order them extra.  Weak Bloody Mary... very disappointing.  

The food menu looks pretty good.  No matter what waist widening fare you're in the mood for... from burgers, to pasta, to ribs; you can find your comfort fare at CD.  We came for something sweet and the server suggested the Salted Caramel Custard or the Apple Monkey Bread.  I'm a sucker for the Hot/Cold combo, so we went for the Monkey Bread. It's made-to-order so prepare to wait 15 min for it.  It's basically like an apple cinnamon roll with vanilla ice cream... pretty delicious.  

Overall... if you can put up with the Scottsdale crowd, Culinary is worth trying at least once.  However, if you are in the market for comfort food, there are better places to try (Chelsea's Kitchen!).  On second thought... Maybe it was the Lou Reed quote that sold me on this place?  It certainly wasn't the Bloody.   Oh well... Fox Restaurant Concepts is good (but rarely great) at what they do."}
{"text":"Treated like a herd of cattle

So it's restaurant week and obviously business wanna make some serious cash by seating as many people as possible. I get that but when the restaurant isn't even busy and you're hurried through each course like all they want you do is leave, lets just say it's not terribly enjoyable. 

The food was pretty decent but the waitress was constantly at our table waiting to see if we'd put our forks down and reaching to remove dishes. I swear there was at least 15 servers standing around at one point.

Not too sure I'll return."}
{"text":"We are here on vacation and found about this place on yelp...checked it out and loved it...Vanessa was an amazing server...will definitely go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"DO NOT VALET your car here and maybe not even park at all since apparently they are having a \"security\" issue with the parking lot...this was the valet service Manager's response after filing an incident report on Tuesday regarding the VERY large, deep scratch on my barely had even a week, new vehicle, which was entrusted in their care; not that I really had an option, because they have two areas for valet service and rope off access to the bigger parking lot..almost forced to valet, so they can damage your vehicle, in which they are not responsible for unless the valet driver is actually driving the vehicle at the time, in which they have no ability to prove if the driver was driving or not..so your screwed regardless! I'll be sure to tell everyone I know, too!"}
{"text":"Very chic and chill. They have colorful cocktails with non-standard liquors and food thats not too bad. Additionally, the setup is pretty fun; outdoors they have pingpong and cornhole with another bar at the very end. Its a cool place to not go too party-ish, but only a little. I usually take my friends from out of town here for the last night."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended and I have heard amazing things about it, so we went when we were in town for a football game. 

It was good. I don't think it was anything to really write home about.  I think people get oohed and awed by the decor, which is totally trendy and cool (and dark).  The pretzels were yummy, but I don't even remember what I ate - which is something you would normally remember at a really great place. 

Overall we were happy with our meal, but I felt as though for all the hype I should have been wowed.  Maybe I need to give it another chance. 

I will say my drink that our server recommended was amazing."}
{"text":"A great place to eat, get a drink or just meet friends. The Turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll is probably the best sandwich I have ever eaten.

The staff is great, friendly and courteous. Service terrific.

Definitely deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for a work party over christmas, really great space for parties. The only issue i think would be the parking. We tried to have our rehearsal dinner here, but decided it would be too difficult for our guests to find parking, and the cost of the food was more than our wedding!"}
{"text":"way fun place.  Absolutely everything was great, from food to drinks to service. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I graduated from ASU this week, and when deciding where to take my mom for a celebratory lunch I could think of no place better than Culinary Dropout. Since this restaurant opened, it has quickly become one of my favorite places to dine, drink, relax and entertain. 
I wanted to bring my mom (who is visiting from New England) somewhere special, somewhere that wouldn't disappoint and that not only satisfy our stomach's but also our elevated moods. We were escorted promptly to a lovely corner table inside the dining room by one of the beautiful hosts that are always welcoming you in as you enter from the parking lot. We were immediately greeted by our brightly smiling server Regan. She wasted no time charming both me and mother, speaking easily to both of us, as if we were old friends. After explaining our appetizer options, and offering to get us drinks, I remembered a beer I had tried once before and loved. Unfortunately, I couldn't remember the name, after giving her a brief description, she guided me through the drink menu until we found what I was looking for. After taking our drink order, I watched her as she gracefully moved from table to table offering the same smile and genuine friendliness to those seated around us, I was amazed and instantly comforted knowing I had chosen to celebrate at the right place.
Throughout our meal, Regan was never absent for more than a couple of minutes, making sure to check in every chance she got, to make sure every second of our stay was absolutely perfect. I commend Culinary Dropout for its outstanding service as well as its delectable food and drink! I can't wait to bring more of my family and friends here, and I encourage you to try this place out if you haven't, it's worth the wait that can accumulate in the evening hours. Trust me. 
Even our goodbye was personal and special!"}
{"text":"I went here with Friends. All my friends and I use Yelp, at the end of the meal taking cost into perspective we all came to this is a 2 star place. The service was a 4, the food was a 3, but the ambiance would be a negative star. They had a band playing that was a good band, but the restaurant does not have the proper acoustics and it was too loud. In conclusion we would go back, but when the band is not playing. The beer selection at this place is very good. The burgers were great. The pretzel fondue was good.  The service and wait staff are excellent.  If it was not for the loud band I would give this 4 stars."}
{"text":"First visit, brought parents and we really enjoyed our lunch.  I had the kale and sweet corn salad - fresh, great flavors, had fresh avocado.  Dad had a MAC burger that was delicious and mom had a pretzel bun turkey sandwich also great.  Enormous asparagus spears as a side order, wow and delicious.  Ordered pretzel balls that come with provolone cheese fondue.  Wow, wow, that made it worth the trip besides our entrees.  Great free parking garage below street level and elevator from parking directly adjacent to restaurant.  Great wait staff, friendly and efficient.  Fresh brewed tea was a plus.  Nice upscale casual decor, definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and had a terrific experience. Ordered the BBQ ribs and exchanged roasted brussel sprouts for the fries ($4 up charge). Everything was delicious. The meat fell off the bone, the sauce was fantastically flavorful, and the sprouts roasted to perfection. The waiter was attentive, service was quick and I enjoyed my experience.

Unfortunately, tonight I went back tonight for dinner and had a terrible experience. I was seated by the hostess at the bar and was told there was a waiter working there. After about 10 minutes with no waiter or service, the man sitting next to me commented on the poor service I was receiving and that he had received. He said they ordered appetizers that came after their meal and their meal took forever to arrive. He also said while they were waiting 2 other people had been seated where I was and both of those people had given up and left due to no service. I waited about 5 more minutes and during that time, the men on my other side were delivered their appetizer, also after their meal. Eventually, I gave up and right as I was leaving, the waitress arrived but I had already soured on the experience and didn't want an extended wait for food, my check, etc. so I left."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great ambiance, great prices. I ordered the kale salad and it was delicious. Not plain at all and it filled me up quite nicely. A lot of night life here, so if you get out of a movie late at night or you want a midnight snack this is the place for you! I love the casual/laid back environment. This place is great if you want to dress up with your friends, or just want to wear casual clothing."}
{"text":"The decor is a site to see. Different materials, such as wood metal and even velvet make it an interesting place to visit.  Other than that, its just another restaurant with somewhat of an overpriced menu, especially for alcohol ( My chicken salad was $12, and mojito was $9).  If you can stay away from the booze, it will definitely save you some cash.  The chicken salad was average at best, as well as the service."}
{"text":"Super cool atmosphere and the monkey bread is the bomb. Server Tim knew what he was talking about and had exceptional service! Definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"The best!  I dont like squash and loved their squash ravioli!!! The best  food ever!!! Everything our party ordered! Thank u!!"}
{"text":"Nice vibe, good range of bar food - the green mussels are tasty.
Good range of beers, including local ones. 
Young crowd, fashionable and flirty. A good night out for twenty/thirtysomethings."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of mixed reviews from friends and from yelp but went to check it out last week and had an great time! 
We showed up at 7 on a Saturday, so we expected a wait, but we found a seat at the huge indoor/outdoor bar and had a few drinks while we waited.
We loved the atmosphere and long tables & bench seating, other people were eating outside too. A band started playing at 9; the servers were very relaxed and casual but had great menu knowledge!! (which I always a good sign)
SIDEBAR: they have a waiter who looks like a cross between Ricky Martin and The Situation.
of COURSE we tried the pretzel fondue. Awesome. As well as the olives appetizer. I had the ahi tuna salad which was large and filling and my boyfriend had the ribs which he oogled they were better than Banderas haha.
All in all, great time, will return!!"}
{"text":"Complete disappointment. Went here with my girlfriend and her cousin, we waited for our food for over an hour and a half. Drinks took just as long.

I asked for an expensive 30$ steak medium rare and it came out an hour and a half later completely well done and not even edible with just fries. Smallest steak i have ever seen and I cannot believe they completely destroyed the food! I was so disappointed that I sent it back and this was the first time that I have ever EVER done this in my life. I didn't want them to re-cook the steak because I didn't want to go through the experience all over again and instead asked for the check. We also found a huge hair in my girlfriend's grilled cheese....

I'm surprised this place has four stars. They did nothing to comfort us and I said I was all set because I didn't want to wait another hour and a half, when other customers were served before us on a quiet monday night!

This place is a joke. STAY AWAY! I'm not a picky eater and go to cheap chinese food bars across the united states, but this place is completely terrible and I literally couldn't eat here. After closing out our huge check when i didn't even eat dinner, I went directly across the hard rock to the next restaurant! 

I was recommended to this place from a work colleague when we went to the Labman conference at HardRock. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The Culinary Dropout has been open 3 weeks now. I give it a 4.5.  Not 5... read to the end to find out why.
 
  I went for lunch yesterday with a friend to check it out.  I LOVED it!  First, I must admit that because it was a beautiful day in Scottsdale my mood was happy to start with.  As we stood outside the front door admiring the patio and deciding if we wanted to go in or not, a very sweet young lady left her hostess stand inside to come out and greet us.  I like this.  She could have waited for us to come to her.  This tells me the restaurant wants business and has trained their employees well!

Right away you notice the atmosphere.  Hip and elegant with a touch of years past... hence the magnificent chandeliers that draw your eye up.  The seating has a look of baroque meets modern.  Well designed, plenty of space... you don't feel crammed into the other people around you.

We of course chose to sit outside because of the beauty of the day.
It took no time at all for a very sweet and adorable waitress to greet us, get our drink orders and give us a few explanations of the house specialty, the Anti-pasta bar.  Before I get into that though... I must recommend a Pisco Sour.  Not many restaurants offer them or even know what they are...definably one of my fav's and believe me... I make them well.

The Anti-pasta bar is designed to let you pick and choose for either an  entree or an app from a wonderful choice of excellent cheeses, salumi's ( that's right... NOT salami... true lovers know the difference.)
olives, marconi almonds and so much more.  Your choices are then beautifully laid out on a  plate after being hand sliced at the bar where you are encouraged to watch the artistry.

On to lunch... I chose a wonderful Smoked Chicken Salad.  They smoke their chicken right there on the sight and I have to say... it was fantastic!!  The pears that had been sweetened, the endive and the pistachios that accompanied the salad to be tossed in a fantastic vinaigrette. It was sublime!  Our meal was finished off with their famous monkey bread that came with a beautiful scoop of ice-cream.

Yes, all the way around I loved this place.  The only reason I haven't given 5 stars is because I will go back and rate the bar.  This is typically the heart of an establishment and will have a lot to do to determine return customers.  Look for my review on this.

Happy eating everyone!!"}
{"text":"This was a fun find. We had time to kill before a flight. The food was both adventurous and delicious. After eating, we went out into the yard and played shuffleboard until we needed to leave. Ping pong tables and cornhole games lent an atmosphere of fun. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable on everything and could answer any question with confidence in seconds. Her describing how they made the fried chicken sold it for my wife and I. And....yea the chicken tasted like it came from back home.(im from TN) the mashed potatoes were very creamy and the biscuit just topped it all. 
Great selection of beer, great live band playing in the background, and after youre done eating and chillin..go towards the back and lose at shuffleboard to your spouse..or you could win, i didnt.   Amazing place hands down. Be sure to try it out."}
{"text":"Skip it.  Great atmosphere, but over-priced mediocre food.  Grilled cheese was nothing more than I could make.  Chicken club was edible... But nothing special .  Food quality was way below expectations and nothing was very good."}
{"text":"Definitely has a beautiful atmosphere. I can't comment on the food because I just stopped in for a few drinks at the bar with some friends. So it was my first time there, had a wells rum & diet coke...the coke ended up being flat. Sadly, the bartender replaced it with another, still was flat, but didn't taste as strong as the first one. I then asked for a beer for \"cheap sake\" and the bartender ended up giving me the largest one? I guess that's automatic when you don't specify. Anywho, I ended up spending about 18 dollars on 2 drinks, which is a little excessive for my liking. I will come back to try the food, but I will not be drinking there ;)"}
{"text":"This place had great food, it was a lot of fun and had excellent customer services. 

I had such a great experience that I recommended it to be the place we go on our team builder at work."}
{"text":"This is a 3+++ rating, almost a 4. LOVED the artichoke salad, add chicken and it's the best salad I've had in a long time. Also, the patio is a great place to hang out and the decor inside is creative and fun. Unfortunately, the lack of happy hour is a big minus. There are a lot of great places nearby that you can sit outside early and enjoy a drink special. Hope CD reconsiders this..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  The first time I went was on a Friday night to meet a friend for a beer.  They have a nice beer selection but the music was way too loud to be able to talk .  To top it off, it was a bad band.  

I went back today for lunch and liked it a lot more than my first experience.  I sat outside on the patio and there was good people watching.  Once again, good beer.  I had the pork belly cubano... it was ok.  There was only one piece of pork on the whole sandwich and it was pretty fatty (understandable considering the cut).  Overall it wasn't too bad, just really rich.  My friend had the italian grinder and loved it.  I saw the burger come out and that looked really good.  Fries were ok.  

I think I will go back and just stick with apps and beer... but I won't go back on a weekend.  I would recommend going during the day anytime of the week for a better experience."}
{"text":"Awful service. Place was about 10% full. Sat at one table for 15 minutes and no one ever came up to our table. Finally we sat at the bar.  The bar staff really wasn't friendly. They really all seemed pretty zoned out

Food was OK at best. 

Only reason I stayed to eat after getting completely ignored is because I know the reputation that Sam Fox's restaurants are in Arizona. 

This was a complete disappointment

Needless to say I will never go back"}
{"text":"Service was  terrific.  Atmosphere was fun, clean and inviting.  Food was very good quality and fair price. We will definitely be coming back and recommending it to other people."}
{"text":"I wish I could have figured out who worked here. Basically the staff seem to be the ones in Halloween costumes of 'cool kids.' Or they might have been hipsters off the street. No way to tell.

So a cool dude who no doubt is a rebel in a leather jacket and ponytail brought us drinks, so I guess he worked there. A different awesome fellow with purple hair and a trilby hat and a cardigan took our order. All the jeans were so tight and torn and so cool I assumed that meant they worked there and/or were in a band. 

I'm not sure I was cool enough to eat here. Even the menu was cool and told me the chefs all wore cool earrings.

I seem to recall the mini fondue was alright, but I was too intimidated by how cool and rebellious this place was.

I'm not sure if 'The Yard' is the property of this place, but they were the only restaurant there. It was both too crowded with drunk people to enjoy with kids, but also too family friendly to be good for a drunk party."}
{"text":"I've always had a love/hate relationship with the old culinary dropout on camelback. Totally a style over substance place from the wait staff to the food, unfortunately this location is no different. 

The boyfriend and I decided to see what all the hype was about with the opening of the Yard and grabbed dinner last Saturday night. The place was PACKED and the space is huge so you can imagine that it was a massive amount of people. However, it looked like most people were on the patio/outback either socializing or playing corn hole; the actual restaurant space itself didn't seem crazy packed. We gave our name to the hostess, who informed us it would be a 45 minute wait and took my phone number to text us when our table was ready. So fancy.  

I must say the actual yard complex is a very cool spot, will def need to come back in some casual clothes to just hang out. although, with a few more dining spots slated to open soon I wonder how long before the courtyard turns into a cluster of people waiting for their tables mixed in with people just drinking and taking up space.

We tried our best to grab a spot at very full bar and got lucky to catch a spot that had just opened up. I got the after school special (my fav from arrogant butcher) and the boyfriend got an old fashioned. Props to the bartender for making some good cocktails. 

We were called to our table in way less than 45 minutes and the hostess led us to a four top which was missing two of the chairs. I found this extremely unprofessional and messy looking and asked the hostess if we could sit at an adjacent table and was told that it was reserved. Whatever, I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it but no one ended up sitting there for the entire time we had dinner. I ordered the bistro steak and the boyfriend ordered the shrimp salad and we also started with the pretzels and fondue. Our waiter seemed super out of it/overwhelmed when he was taking our order and it was definitely a foreshadowing of things to come. My steak and French fries both came out cold and dry, which I found very strange since the other item on our order was a salad which shouldn't have required any wait time for prep. Some rando dropped off our food so I had to wait about five minutes to track down our waiter to tell him my food was cold and I needed more drank! He was rather nice about everything and someone I am assuming is his manager later came by and told me they were getting me a new steak. We had to wait awhile for the new steak and the waiter guy never brought me my next cocktail so I sat there with a dry throat picking at the boyfriend's salad. My steak arrived before my drink, clearly because the waiter had forgotten to put the order in and was only visiting our table every 45 minutes. When he finally showed back-up, the boyfriend let him know I still didn't have my drink. Eventually he brought me a new drink, but without a straw... such a tease. I get that the restaurant is new and they are still working out the kinks but with another location and a vast amount of wait staff to source from other restaurants, I would expect that Sam Fox would assemble a more professional experienced team to open this new restaurant. Our waiter looked like it was his first day every serving. Our bill eventually came and I was surprised that no one thought to compensate us for the disruption caused by the poor kitchen execution,,, a free round or dessert or something to wash the bad taste out. 

Honestly, I'll probably return to Culinary Dropout just for the atmosphere but I will definitely be sticking to drink and apps for awhile until I forget how bad their service sucks again."}
{"text":"My sister hosted a baby shower for me at Culinary Dropout (my suggestion based on great feedback from some coworkers) and we were treated so well!  We had a large-ish group of 10 people plus cupcakes and gifts.  I have to honestly say, I have never been treated better at a restaurant with such a large party.

The group ordered everything from the nachos to the grilled cheese sliders to hamburgers.  We also ordered the pretzels and fondue and they brought out an extra order since our meals were taking longer than expected to come out.  The food was absolutely delicious!

I can't wait to come back when not pregnant to enjoy some cocktails with my husband.  The manager guy (I think he was the manager) came over and said some kind words, spoke with my mother in law about the live band that was playing, and made sure I was satisfied before we left.  I cannot speak highly enough of this little hipster haven!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, and sometimes live music! Get the pretzel bites appetizer and the bloody mary's! Great girls night/happy hour/date night spot."}
{"text":"This is an update to a prior review. My previous experience here was not the best, I wasn't happy with the food the first time around. The manager reached out to me right away, and was not negative or defensive about my comments, which I found extremely  professional. I took her up on the offer to return for dinner and give them another chance.  This time around, the food was great, service was extremely attentive, no complaints. Two different managers even approached us during our meal to introduce themselves and make sure we were happy with everything. I learned a lesson in all of this, to speak up if I'm not happy with the quality of a meal right away, instead of going home and writing a negative review. I should have said something the first time around, instead of worrying about being labeled a complainer. Negative reviews should only be written if you bring issues up, and no attempt us made to resolve the isssue/ problem."}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times and the service at the Scottsdale location is far superior. However, the food is AMAZING and the atmosphere rocks! If you're looking for a GREAT happy hour spot, this is it.... just be prepared for not so impressive service. 


*Side note: get here early (5pm-6pm) parking is tricky and valet space is limited."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect upon hearing the name of this restaurant.  Was it run by culinary students who failed culinary school?  And if so, do we dare host a job interview meal here?  I don't know the origins of the restaurant name - but we did host our job interview meal here last night and had a wonderful dinner!  This is a must see, must eat Vegas restaurant!!  

There are oh, maybe, 500 restaurants \"to see\" in Las Vegas - this is one of them!  Culinary Dropout blew my mind.  It is beautiful!!   It is Classic Industrial at it's finest!  The furniture is contemporary classic - tufted sofas, wingback chairs, wooden industrial tables.  Simply stunning decor.  Beautifully decorated with a wall of windows overlooking the HRH pool, with a GINORMOUS patio outside that probably seats 100 people easy.  Hands down, best patio dining I have seen in Las Vegas!!   

I'm a terrible Yelper for not taking photos.  I was interviewing a job candidate - not showing off my YELP skillz.  You will have to go see the place for yourself! 

The food?  Oh yeah, the food!  They have an awesome starter menu of Antipasta where each table can individually create their own antipasta plate by filling out a menu card - similar to sushi places where you mark what you want.  We started with a few meats and cheeses - all of which we enjoyed.  They are served with some bread and mini breadsticks that resemble pretzels.  

The menu contains a little bit of everything.  Really, everything.  From meatloaf, to chicken curry, to fried chicken, to steak, to jambalaya, to a slew of salads and sandwiches.  There is something for everyone here.  

I decided to order the Bistro Steak - served with house fries and a gorgonzola sauce.  I don't consider myself a Steak connoisseur by any means - but this steak was awesome!!  Perfectly tender and juicy and charred - and served off the bone in a strip of mini segments of meat.  The fries are hand-cut and also very good.  My dining partners had the fried chicken and the salmon - both of which were devoured.  

For dessert we shared the Monkey Bread that other Yelpers recommended.  Served hot with a side of ice cream, it is PERFECT for sharing and was amazingly delicious!!  

Prices are actually reasonable - but if you want to enjoy the place you can expect about $50 per person with drinks for dinner.  Our party of 3 with many drinks, appetizer, entrees, and dessert ran us $177.  

The service was excellent - their beer selection is \"crafty\" and \"traditional\" and the restaurant ambiance is stellar.  We had a very enjoyable meal - staying for almost 3 hours and enjoying every minute.  I will return here soon with my husband and friends!!"}
{"text":"The place is very nice.   Service was good. We ate the homemade pretzel which was fantastic. Main course had steak which was good and we had the chicken salad which was okay. Overall a nice place to go."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great food & drinks. Went here for a quick bite and sat outside. We ordered some of the meat/cheese options and a few of their mule cocktails. Split a sandwich as well. The food portions are more than enough to split. 

This place is definitely great for groups with the outdoor games.  I would recommend going with a group because it's a little loud for just 2 people to have a conversation. I will be returning for happy hour in the future."}
{"text":"Wierd place. I say that as a compliment, because that is what it is supposed to be. I would desribe it as upscale rock and roll. Waitress was great. She suggested the pretzels which were very good. We ordered white shrimp and oysters from the raw bar. Both were very good. The shrimp were half the size of a hot dog! We then split a prime rib sandwich and it was good. Beer selection was crazy good. I was surprised at how bad the beer selection was in most of Vegas, but not here. Beer snobs will love the menu!"}
{"text":"Great food. Have never been disappointed. The pretzels and fondue are our favorite. Fun games area."}
{"text":"Brisa was wonderful. You go girl. We will be back at 3am. The dogs are righteous. Amazing peeps!!!!"}
{"text":"I was privileged enough to be at Culinary Dropout's soft opening this past weekend. Sam Fox has done it again!!! What a great restaurant! The ambiance is very cool and casual. It caters to a 30's something crowd which is just what downtown Tempe needed. 

The decor includes hanging lights, cozy couches with fire pits and murals of Johnny Cash and Freddie Mercury. There is ample space for large crowds or something a little more intimate, if you prefer. 

Now for the food! My friends and I started with the pretzels and fondue. Sooo delicious!! Not quite ready for entrees, we ordered the cheese plate next. I highly recommended the goat cheese. It's perfect!

Entrees were finally decided. I chose the meatloaf. Most people wouldn't dare order something that \"only Mama can make\". I'm here to tell you this meatloaf will make you slap your Mama! It's that good! Savory and flavorful and a generous portion. The green beans were on point too. The mashed potatoes seemed to be the instant kind. Easy to overlook with that meatloaf begging to be devoured!

As for the cocktails, they left a little to be desired. I ordered a Moscow Mule. For $10 a drink, I expected a little more punch. Nonetheless, it was a great drink.

Finally, the service. Every person on the staff is friendly and courteous. They are all more than willing to tend to your needs. The only problem is, they blend in with the patrons. There is no uniform or name tag worn. You have to look for someone carrying dishes or drinks to know who they are. 

Overall, this is a much needed addition for the City of Tempe. I highly recommend supporting this restaurant. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"In the lobby of the Hard Rock Hotel, this place is trendy chic meets BBQ Steakhouse.  The staff a a bunch of young hip cute kids who move fast, and give friendly helpful service with a smile.  The menu has lots of good options of comfort foods. I would call it comfort food chic.They have some really tasty options in beers too. We had the fresh made chips with the onion dip, which was tasty. I had Meatloaf dinner and they even add the grilled the bread I wanted without a problem. Perfectly tasty!! My husband says the ribs are good, coleslaw excellent but $27?? Get a blue berry beer while you wait."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times this week and the food has been excellent.  The servers have all been very knowledgeable about all menu items and super friendly.  This has become our go to place this week.  Wednesday evening we had the pleasure of having Gina as our server.  She was our favorite so far. Energetic and personable the restaurant is lucky to have her!  Try this restaurant you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good food..a little pricey for what they serve. Had a burger here and it was pretty good. Love the live Music they had great place to go drink some beers and chill.."}
{"text":"Love the environment, like the food, dislike the service.

I am in love with all of the Fox restaurants and I have gone to Culinary Dropout quite a few times. I always get the pretzel and provolone appetizer and the grilled cheese. Both to die for. They also have a lot of unusual drinks that are quite tasty! 

I do, however, have to say that it is not worth hitting up for happy hour. There are only a few items to choose from and most of the drinks are still full price. I went with a friend recently and we, of course, ordered the pretzel and provolone appetizer. When we got our bill, we noticed that we were charged full price for the appetizer when it was supposed to be half price. When we asked our waitress, she said \"OH...I did not realize that you guys were here for happy hour. You see, the happy hour version of the appetizer is half the SIZE which is why it is half the price. You guys got the full size so it is full price.\" Does this seem weird to anyone else? When you order an appetizer at 3pm on Friday afternoon isn't it implied that you are wanting happy hour? And is it really even a \"deal\" if you are getting 1/2 the quantity anyway? Weird."}
{"text":"Don't go!  Food was good and the waitress was very nice.  However my husband ordered bottom shelf margaritas and was charged for top shelf.  I got a kaluha didn't know what they brought the waitress agreed and said she'd bring a new one and then charged me for both.  Food was good and the atmosphere was good but I would never go back or recommend since you are going to be ripped off if you do not look over your bill completely."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant whenever I am in Las Vegas! The atmosphere here is simply amazing! I had a server named Jacquelynn who was always on top of everything and made my visit memorable! She suggested I try the fried chicken and it was the perfect choice. It comes with a biscuit and coleslaw but the honey drizzle on the chicken made it absolutely delicious! Came back here again before I left town and had to come see Jacquelynn again! A+++ overall! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"From the pretzel balls to the salmon entree and the corn and kale salad, the food is delicious. The ambiance is casual cool. They have ping pong tables, selfie stand for group photos and good vibe. It's more than bar food, its culinary dropout."}
{"text":"Today I had my first experience eating and drinking at this fun establishment! The food was wonderful and our bartender was a joy! His name was Matt and he was extremely knowledgable about the drinks and gave wonderful food suggestions! I would definitely come back to Culinary Drop Out. The vibe was really hip and I had a great experience!"}
{"text":"The fact the menu hasn't changed in three years should be embarrassing to their chef. We have been many times in the last few years, but CD lost customers after yesterday. Grilled Cheese Sliders tasted like cheese from a can & \"Chicken Club\" is a dry, tough chicken breast on huge, stale bun with wilted lettuce. Pair those with a $6.50 bottle of beer and your on par with airport restaurants. Informing our server that we weren't happy with our food got us a free appetizer for \"next time\" after he talked to the Manager (who never visited our table). I worked in restaurants for 20 years and that's not how you handle a complaint. Too much competition in Scottsdale not to go elsewhere. A shame, because it used to be pretty good."}
{"text":"Terrific food and decent prices with great atmosphere....terrible service though :("}
{"text":"This is a franchise? The quality overall superb. We went with the pretzel, soup and drank several original mules. The ambience was fun aided by layout of the patio eating area. Felicia our server was most fantastic as she was very accommodating to our 4 year old's endless questions. On the right occasion, Nice place to hit up prior to an evening of Vegas debauchery."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Deviled eggs, Thai wings, sliders.  Love the staff.  This will be a must do every trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday afternoon, right when happy hour had started. Really nice atmosphere, bags ping pong tables. Carrara marble tables plush couches. Mural art of \"legends\" really a decor that everyone will like some aspect of it. Ordered a blind double. Because I'm classy. It's a random beer and random shot. My kind of place. Also ordered nachos and antipasti chefs choice. Both were very good!! I could see how this place would be awesome for a Friday or Saturday nights. Or Sunday funday. I'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  From the pretzels to the carmel dessert, everything was amazing and exceeded my expectations!  Loved it.  The service was great and there was a really good band."}
{"text":"I went there with a couple of co-workers for some beers after work and was not impressed.  Service was really slow and we had 3 different servers.  20 minutes between ordering a beer and having it arrive.  The food is good but overpriced for what it is.  The atmosphere is fun and lively and there are a lot of things to do."}
{"text":"Ok place, very limited menu and over priced for what you get. I was staying @ the hotel, and as my room and meals were comped, I wanted to try it out. For a comped meal it was fine, but nothing special. Had a burger and fries here, but surprised that the portion size was so small.
Service was also lacking w long wait times to clear the dishes and refill drinks, surprising it was not crowded on a Sunday afternoon. My friends also agreed it is not a place worth visiting again."}
{"text":"Where do I begin....first, I was excited about trying Sam Fox's new concept since my wife had drinks and appetizers there the night before. Walking up to the front, we were greeted by a line of folks waiting to put there name on the list. This took literally 15 minutes to put 2 names on the \"wait\" list.  As we checked in, I noticed 4 tables open and the host told us it was an hour wait as he rifled through 3 pages of names.  Being in the restaurant business for 15 yrs I knew he was either under quoting or had NO clue on how to work the front.

We proceeded to the bar to order cocktails and waited 10 minutes for someone to greet us. Bar was full and there were 4 bartenders working and not focused on the customers. After ordering a bottle of Shiraz, I noticed the same 4 tables were still open from when my wife & I arrived. We ran into a couple that we knew and they mentioned that they were going to join their friends on the patio while they waited for a table.  We were told that these tables were first come, first serve, but evidently this was incorrect information.  

Supposedly, the General Manager was irate at one of the folks we were with and he told ALL the servers on the patio not to serve us food or drinks. I guess he was going to get back at paying customers. Not too bright and probably uses one chopstick to eat Chinese food.

It is now 9:15 and we are 15 minutes over our desired wait time communicated by the host. I then search out for one of the servers to see if we can order food since all the other tables were eating. She tells me that her GM told her not to serve us at all for taking the table and how we ruined their night and they are not able to make their tips. Nice! I then ask if I can speak to the GM and she brings me to the host. Seriously!!! The GM has been working the host desk and not the entire restaurant??? 

We decide to leave after not trying anything on the menu and being forced to eat somewhere else at 10:00pm after arriving there at 8pm. Upon leaving my wife went to let the host/GM know how terrible of an experience it was and he told her that he could seat us now. Ridiculous. I will never be back.

The \"funniest\" thing about this whole evening is that the person who pissed off the GM is Sam Fox's neighbor - guess who will be hearing about our experience first hand!!"}
{"text":"ROCK & ROLL!!!  This place was way too loud for us, and we saw that an adjacent table with 50+ somethings also were struggling to speak to one another and the wait staff.  The ambiance was contemporary and industrial and not what we would call comfortable.   The wait staff sported edgy clothing which was tight, dark & off the shoulder.... I must say that our server was sweet, but unable to answer some of our questions about the menu, and then after promising to let us know the answer, forget to do so.  

The food was actually pretty good for what it was (snack, finger, bar-type food), but given the restaurant's prime location across from Fashion Square, the prices exceeded the quality.   Can't say we'll be back, but I will recommend the place for happy hour to our 30 year old daughter when when she comes to visit."}
{"text":"So glad we went here for dinner while on vacation.  Such a fun, different place that we probably wouldn't have chose had my by's friend not suggested it.  We played 'restaurant' before going, so we knew a majority of what was on the menu and had an idea of what we wanted.  

Cute atmosphere, and deco.  Super friendly hostess and wait staff.  Bathrooms (womens) were clean and decorated to match the style of the restaurant.  

We sat outside and our party had a few drinks to start.  Gin & tonic, and the vodka/grapefruit/cran/lemon cocktail. Highllllly recommended.  

We only got the pretzel fondue for an appetizer, but I think we could have just eaten them.  Pretzels were warm and soft and covered in the perfect amount of sea salt.  The candle under our cheese blew out upon arrival, but I don't think a tea light would have kept the cheese warm and melty for too long anyway.  Maybe a mini-sterno??  Still, those were sooooo good.  

Our party had the fried chicken, turkey pastrami, and shaved prime rib dip for dinner.  The review on the fried chicken was 'good, but not the best I've had'.  Thought I didn't eat it, to me it looked like it was really dark, maybe almost over fried?  Turkey pastrami... 'Good, but hard to eat'. It was a huge sandwich, and though I've been told I have a big mouth....don't think I could have made it fit very gracefully.  I had the shaved prime rib dip...loved it.  I hadn't had a French dip style sandwich in a long time, and I love prime rib so I went for it.  Great bread and a yummy melted cheese on top.  Cut in half and easy to dunk in the nice big bowl of a jus.  The fries were rated an over all 'meh' by our group.  I've had better.  These were small and thin.  I'd rather have had a seasoned steak fry.  

But again, very cute and trendy place with some very yummy food.  I'd go here again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout rocks!  The drink menu is awesome.  Tons of beers to choose from and many priced around $5.  The cocktails are very unique and really good.  Now to the food.  There are many standouts, but if you could only get one thing, get the Soft Pretzles with Provolone Fondue.  They are amazing and I dream about them often.  Soft pillowy pretzle bites that are moist and amazing.  So good you can eat them plain.  But you shouldn't because the provolone fondue is super yummy.  For the entrees, I've had the Cuban Sandwich, Shaved Prime Rib Dip Sandwich, The Pub Burger, and the Gnocchi.  The cuban sandwich is made with pork belly and is amazing.  I usually ask for a little extra yellow mustard because I like my cuban to be a little more traditional.  The Pub Burger is amazing.  The Gnocchi is make with mushrooms and truffle oil and is heavy, but worth it.  

The atmosphere is beautiful and all of the waiters I've had have been great.  They always make great recommendations are will take care of you.  

I will keep going to Culinary Dropout on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The feeling that you get walking into Culinary Dropout must be what it's like to drop some E (as I understand it)... You just want to touch everything! The interior design of the place is a crazy overload of eclectic textures (both tactile and visual) that somehow work together in a harmonious fashion: embossed walls, plush armchairs, supple leather couches, smooth wood tables, glittering chandeliers (ooohhh, shiny)... Sorry. Got distracted for second there. On to the food!

First of all, Culinary Dropout is a gastropub. Which means, with 25 different specialty mixed drinks (including a bacon-infused bloody mary), 44 kinds of beers and 27 wines to choose from, the alcohol is a-flowing. As I was in the mood to try something new, my server (armed with the knowledge that my favorite beer is Guinness) was able to steer me towards the 8 Ball from Lost Cost in California. Pretty tasty... Since I was there with a friend, we decided to do the tapas-esque feast and order a variety of small dishes to share: the Lingot du Quercy (a French, handmade goat cheese served with a cranberry compote and some crusty bread), Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue (pretzel balls served with a small cauldron of warm, liquid cheese), Artichoke Salad (thinly-sliced artichoke hearts and asparagus tossed with endive and Parmesan in a crisp dressing) and Grilled Asparagus.

All the food was very good, but the stand out for me (simultaneously as my favorite taste and biggest gripe) was the Artichoke Salad. Served in a bowl (you'll see why this is important in a second), the salad had an amazing flavor coupled with an interplay of crisp and tender textures. However, by the time we finished the salad, it was over-dressed and rather soggy. Any guesses why? That's right. It was served in a bowl (a fairly narrow one at that). With all the excess dressing pooling to the bottom of the bowl to drown the remainder of the salad, this particular taste experience went from awesome to melancholy pretty quick.

Aside from the space and food, one particularly nice surprise was the discovery that Culinary Dropout hosts live music as well. A local band called The Market started up about halfway through our meal. Sounding like an interesting bluesy/funk-ish take on Cake (they even have a trumpet), the Market was really very good. I'm looking forward to catching them again soon in my musical travels around town!

All in all, a very good first go at this newly-established gastropub. With the likelihood of fun times, tasty food and great music in the mix, I doubt that this experience at Culinary Dropout will be my last."}
{"text":"Cool-looking place, decent food, pretty good service.  Why only two stars instead of three?  We made a reservation over the phone, showed up on time, and still had to wait over an hour, being lied to repeatedly by the hostesses in the process, while other groups with later reservations were seated before us. Not worth it.  Avoid."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had such a wonderful experience here. The environment is so lively and carefree. The live music on the weekends is fantastic and the food was absolutely delicious. The service was outstanding as well."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My boyfriend and I were just in Vegas and stayed at HR. We first went to Culinary Dropout Sunday morning before Rehab. The service was incredible!! I didn't know what I wanted to drink and our server made a perfect suggestion (some sort of gin drink, maybe ginger beer too? He described it as a spinoff of a mimosa). The food was really really good. We went back the morning of our checkout but misses breakfast so we didn't stay. But our second server was very courteous and understanding, she even have me coffee to go. We will definitely be back here anytime we go to Vegas, whether we stay at Hard Rock or not. The decor is like an industrial kitchen, open and comfortable. The patio is edged by the pool so all around the venue is fantastic. Definitely one of my top restaurants in Vegas and overall favorites."}
{"text":"I cannot figure out why people like this place. Our second visit was actually worse than the first time. The food is always salty. My salad was salty. Seriously, my salad. The service was the absolute worst. After I hadn't seen our server for well over ten minutes, she appears again, I let her know we are on a lunch break, so time is a factor and we'd like to order. She says okay, and then disappears for another five minutes. No drink refills. Two stars is for the beer selection. I'll never come back."}
{"text":"Ammendment: the manager, Blake, spoke with us and addressed our concerns. Very impressed that management actually listens! Thank you, Blake. We will be back because of you! 

Original review: Great bar, but WTF is with all the kids everywhere? I come to a bar to have some cocktails with my adult friends...not to dodge kids. There are no less than 15 kids running all over the patio today."}
{"text":"I had dinner Friday at Culinary Dropout. It took over the spot where the ill-fated Pink Taco used to be (next door to Wildfish). It's a great location with exposure to the mall crowd at Fashion Square and around the corner from South Bridge. This is another Fox Restaurant Concepts eatery (I'm a fan of most of their places), so I've been wanting to check this place out since it opened a few months ago.

Culinary Dropout was pretty busy the Friday night we were there. The bar area is a fair size and it was packed two people deep around it. The restaurant itself kind of sprawls out. It has fairly high ceilings and they mounted several flat panel TV's up high, so they can be seen from just about anywhere, but they do not detract from the overall atmosphere. I kind of liked being able to look up and catch the score of the game whenever I wanted to. The seating is a serious hodgepodge of furniture. Round tables, square tables, bench seats, wing chairs, and low backed lounge chairs with various fabric patterns make up the decor. This may sound bad, but it actually works (and the seats are very comfy, too). The place is fairly dim, but not like a cave. Noise levels were elevated, but we were able to carry on a conversation without any issues.

You can tell Culinary Droout wants to be more of a bar just by looking at the beer list vs. the wine list. The number of beers is twice as many as the wine, which is not a bad thing if that is what you're in the mood for. They have beers from all over the world and in any style you could want. The wine list is fairly small, with maybe 30 or so wines, but the selection is decent. Everything is available by the glass or the bottle and prices seem to be pretty much 2x retail. We had a bottle of Kinton Syrah that was $35. It's a fine example of a California Central Coast Rhone varietal: dark, rich, fruity, and just delicious.

The menu is a nice assortment of both small plates and entrées. You can mix and match your own antipasti as well. Prices range from about $12 and under for the appetizers and all the entrées are pretty much less than $20. There were so many good things to choose from that we ended up picking several different things from all over the menu. Here's a breakdown of what we ordered:

    * Chilled Oysters - These were perfect, medium sized oysters from the Pacific Northwest (I asked what type they were and forgot, but they were similar to Hog Island oysters). All I know is they were exactly as I like them to be. Creamy texture and very silky. Just a squeeze of lemon and dash of hot sauce was all they needed to be a perfect starter dish for the meal.
    * Artichoke Salad - This was actually a mix of artichokes, chopped asparagus, endive, and shaved parmesan. Let me just say that the salad is awesome. It was so good that my date would've probably dumped me for it...
    * Butternut Squash Cannelloni - We were debating on having room for this dish, but it sounded so good we had to try it and was very worth it. I'm sometimes not a fan of this type of pasta because there's too much filling, but this one was done very well. The pasta pieces were a smaller size and the butternut squash filling was just the right amount. The sauce was not overly rich and overall it was a very enjoyable dish.
    * Bistro Steak -This is a thin cut sirloin with a creamy peppercorn sauce that has just the right amount of spice to it without being overpowering. It is served with a side of french fries that are very tasty. The steak itself was cooked nicely and it's a satisfying large plate entree.

Final Take

I wasn't sure what to expect from this restaurant, but left knowing I'd be back. The food was great and the service staff was very nice. The manager was also making rounds a swell. We share all our food and the kitchen split all of our courses onto two plates for us (that's always a nice and welcome touch). People coming here looking for high end bar food will not be disappointed. If you're expecting something special, well you'll need to look elsewhere as Dropout is geared more towards being a restaurant-sized bar that serves up good grub. And for most people on a Friday night, that's just what the doctor ordered...

Overall Grade = B+ (Very Good)

{"text":"OMG. Took an out of town friend here at 9:30 PM. I was starving. Ordered a house burger. Killed it once it arrived. Half way through said the texture is a little weird. Looked at it. Completely raw inside. Not rare. RAW!!!. Complained. They brought me a new burger I took home. Went home to bed. 1:00 AM - Woke up - What's that noise? 1:30 AM - Why am I sweating. 1:45 AM - Burger plans escape. 2:00 AM - Burger makes escape via two exits. Really guys. Making a burger isn't that hard and not  killing your customers should be a main goal. It's called a meat thermometer. Now I know why they call it culinary DROPOUT. I'm definitely out! Feeling a little nauseous just thinking about it. Next call. Board of health."}
{"text":"The only reason Im not giving this 5 stars is that Culinary Dropout is not vegan friendly. Love this place anyway!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent experience. It was buuuusssyyy! I would definitely recommend making reservations if you would like to avoid a 15-30 minute wait. Although I didn't order drinks, the bar seemed to be a great way to kill the time. Additionally, it seemed most people came for some drinks. Once seated, ordered the pretzels and cheese, chicken salad, and tuna salad. All of the food was great! The cheese fondue was unique and yummy. Pretzels resembled the texture of a cake doughnut (minus the sweetness, of course). Both salads were very filling and full of flavor. Overall, I've tasted the food here, but I probably wouldn't choose to come back here on my own. Nothing against them as a restaurant. They just didn't blow my skirt up."}
{"text":"The Fox food empire has done it again.  With the demise of the Pink Taco (who could have forecasted that???) and their recently-emptied location, Culinary Dropout moved in to offer great American food at reasonable prices.  

The menu is fairly limited, but with multiple iterations of cheeseburgers, very good fries, and great appetizers, there are more than enough options for the casual diners who find themselves on the Water Front.  Even though the burger and the fries were very good, I found the appetizers to be the best part of the meal.  There is an impressive assortment of meats and cheeses, so you can customize your own tapas if that is what you're into.  If you're not in the mood for a meat-and-cheese appetizer, the pretzel fondue is definitely worth a shot.  The homemade pretzels were awesome and the cheese dip puts traditional nacho cheese to shame.  

I ended up at the restaurant on a random Wednesday night and the place was packed.  I feel pretty comfortable saying that given the good drink list, and affordable good food, you should expect to wait for a table unless you like to eat dinner early."}
{"text":"This decision isn't one that I'm happy about. As a first time patron at the Culinary Dropout, I have to say, I will not be returning not because of the food (by the way, the food was OUTSTANDING) but because of the our waitress. On a Friday night, one could expect to have a delay in being seated, having orders taken...but to wait 45 minutes for your drink to arrive after already waiting 15 minutes for your waitress to acknowledge our table, is ridiculous! On top of waiting, a lady in our group asked for her drink three times, in which the waitress walked away twice while the request was being made....I mean who does that? Oh and by the way, never ONCE was I offered a refill on my Diet Coke during the 2+ hours of being there. 

Now on to the food, as stated above, the food is outstanding, however, due to our waitress not bringing our food out in a timely manner, my steak was cold. By this time, I had enough of the service issues and just wanted OUT. 

The check arrives, and lone behold, it's wrong...waitress fixes the check, and proceeds to cash us out...our total bill for two is a little over $60, I hand the waitress a $100, and should have received $41.36 back in change....guess what, the waitress returns $41 and no change. So needless to say, your waitress should be thankful she kept the $.36 in change because that's $.35 more than what she was going to get from me. 

I honestly hope the Culinary Dropout reviews this and either contacts me for more information  before this waitress is allowed to ruin what could be an amazing experience for others."}
{"text":"We LOOOOOVE this place! What's better than getting drunk, watching a football game and playing ping pong? I can't think of a better way to spend a Friday night. We loved it so much, we came back on Saturday for round two! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was great too. I loved the unique flavors they twisted into classic drinks. I may watch too much HGTV, but I seriously loved the interior decor of this place  the lighting, textures, especially the bathroom, everything was awesome. We can't wait to visit Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and an entertaining environment. I've tried a few things on the menu but my favorite so far is the french dip. Gotta love $3 pbr's"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a group of co-workers (about 15 of us). Server was on point with bringing around a bunch of soft drinks before we even ordered them (iced tea, waters, pop & even ginger ale). Gave us a few recommendations of appetizers and main entrees and a bunch of is each had them and shared amongst the group. Best appetizer was the pretzel and cheese fondue (my mouths watering as I type this) and the potato chips with onion dip (oh gosh). Must have the honey battered fried chicken, ma...meat loaf, turkey pastrami and shaved prime rib dip. So that's the food review. Will definitely be coming back to try more of the items on the menu.
I would have given a 5 star if we hadn't have to wait so long to get our check."}
{"text":"Foods good , drink are overrated and over priced , go to eat , not to enjoy cocktails."}
{"text":"Is there a zero star.  Service was extremely slow uncooperative.   Fish and chips were soggy not even one bit of crisp.  Pretty sad.  I would highly recommended not going here.  The servers couldn't even get the meal entrees right.  I have been to some bad places in my life but this tops them all."}
{"text":"Fun place! They have great food, great service and fun live music.  If you go order the pretzels and cheese, it will steal the show!"}
{"text":"Waited an hour to get two stools at the bar .  Waiters were rude , menu was incredibly limited and incredibly overpriced  took 40 min to get some mini grilled cheese sandwiches and a chopped salad.  Nothing special my six year old could and does do a better job .  Just because a restaurant is located in the hard rock hotel and casino does not make it acceptable to be rude and serve overcharged bad food !  I will not return"}
{"text":"Such a fun place for friends and family. Lots of fun things to do. Food is cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Friday night out. Despite having reservation there was delay with our group being seated. Several hosts including manager had to verify our reservation couple times. Finally we were seated but background music was obnoxiously too loud, making conversation inside practically impossible. Because of that we decided to get table outside at the patio. Outdoor tables seemed not to match the rest of the decor. Cheap looking plastic tables like in some burger place. Food was good and service was fast enough. Overall nice experience but lack of professionalism/knowledge on host/staff side. Fried chicken wasn't as good as you would've expected from this type of \"high end\" restaurant. Biggest disappointment was probably too loud music inside. It's not a dance club or concert. People go to restaurants to eat and socialize not to yell over loud music in order to be heard."}
{"text":"This place wasn't that great for the price.  I spent 15 on 2 mini grilled cheese sliders and a tea (basically bar food over priced) Not much to choose from on the menu plus portion size didn't equal out to what I paid for.   The crowd is very Scottsdale and the staff wasn't that friendly.  Definitely wont go back here again."}
{"text":"Eh...not good...but not bad.  Just ok and the onion soup was bad.  How can you mess up a simple french onion soup?

The fried chicken was good, but overly sweet-fried chicken should not be sweet even if its called maple fried chicken.

Shared many apps/salads among friends and they were ok.

If you are staying at the Hard Rock its worth a lunch or early dinner, but nothing more."}
{"text":"I generally enjoyed my time at Culinary Dropout, though most was due to the wait staff. Our waitress was beyond rad. She was over enough to be attentive but not so much to seem pushy. She was funny and sweet and, frankly, quite a looker. I felt the urge to slip her my digits. But that is neither here nor there. 

Our appetizer, the soft pretzel bites with provolone fondue, was ridiculously good. The butternut cannelloni, however, was a little lackluster and I was disappointed in the limited vegetarian options. 

But the decor was cool and the music was awesome so I'm totally down to give it a second try. My fingers will be crossed in hopes of getting the same waitress."}
{"text":"Great food.  Big restaurant.  Games to play around the restaurant.  Liked that part of it was inside and part was outside.  It is pricey and the portions are on the small side but they taste good."}
{"text":"A happy day was soured by a condescending manager, Jason Brown, at the Culinary Dropout. Our event at the Culinary Dropout was coordinated with Alexia Haley, the Event Manager, to celebrate my son's High School graduation.  My initial interest was to have it as a dinner function but was told that the yard area (ping pong, bag toss, etc.) will be for those 21 and older after 6 pm.  So we decided to have the event at 1 pm.  We booked two locations - two lounge seating areas for the high school graduates and a table of 14 in the restaurant for adults.  Shortly after the guests arrived, my son told me that they were not allowed in the ping pong area unless they were accompanied by someone at least 21 years old.
I was surprised at his comment but thought the person didn't know that they were 18 year olds and also to relay that the event manager was fine with the 18 year olds and ping pong as long as we were out of the place by 6pm. As soon as I got to the gaming area I was met by an angry man who started yelling at me that the kids can't be in the area unless they were accompanied by a 21-year-old and that he will lose his liquor license.  I proceeded to explain to him that this event had been arranged through Alexia and I was never told to have a 21-year-old present at the ping pong table.  He started yelling \"that he had told Alexia to inform me of the 21-year-old escort rule. And that my teens had to leave if a 21-year-old wasn't present by the table right now.\"  To not disrupt the kids' game, I stayed at the gaming area for a bit but was concerned with the arriving guests. A parent, Anthony, who was watching his younger kids, volunteered to watch my 18 year olds for 5 minutes so I can return to my table to sort out the problem.  I didn't want to create a commotion as I had approximately 30 teenagers arriving and adults at the main dining area. As a courtesy, I informed Jason Brown that I needed five minutes and that the gentlemen (Anthony) standing by the gaming tables will be watching my teens so I can sort out this escort problem.  He spat out \"He cannot watch your kids - Anthony doesn't belong to your party.\"  I replied, \"You told me an adult or a 21-year-old needs to be present and right now he is helping me so I can return to my table to sort out this problem.\"  He shouted \"you are not taking 5 minutes, if you are not back in 2 minutes, your kids will not be playing\".  I later found out he was the District Manager of Culinary Dropout. I am appalled at his condescending conversation towards me. Not only did he not try to help rectify a situation that was a communication problem from his event management staff, but he spoke like a bully. I felt belittled and humiliated. My only conclusion is either he had a bad day or he dislikes Asians.
In the service industry, service is key regardless of who you serve.  As a manager, he should try to not make matters worse or intimidate.  He had two other staff standing alongside him guarding the gaming area and as the restaurant wasn't full, he could have helped me if he wanted to.
After I sorted my guests and created a rotating shift at the ping pong table, one of my friends asked to speak to the manager. Much to my surprise, Jason Brown showed up.  I don't know what the nature of their discussion was but at the end, he gifted two of the wines we ordered - a gesture we very much appreciated. 
All the staff at Culinary Dropout were courteous and Alexia Haley was a joy to work with. All the guests were happy at the end of the day but Jason's conversation with me at the gaming area makes me want to speak up for all the minorities that gets picked on based on a preconceived notion of a particular minority feature...  this is especially important for managers or District Managers. Tempe is a diverse college city with lots of Internationals and I hope everyone gets the respect they deserve as a citizen of the world no matter their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.
Would have been 4 stars if not for the intimidating encounter with Jason Brown.  I frequent this place and have recommended it to many friends.  So sad."}
{"text":"I went here for my bachelorette party and it was a great experience. The service was outstanding and our food was phenomenal. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant a 2nd chance before writing a review and it's just as terrible as the first time I ate here. Absolutely nothing you order comes out in the correct order. If you order a salad you will receive it after your entree. A beer takes 30min. Oysters are $3 a piece- insane- and taste as though they have been frozen and thawed ten times. My girlfriend literally spit hers out and couldn't eat it. The chicken on our skewers was dry. I don't even understand how this place has good ratings."}
{"text":"Only have been here once on a Sunday for lunch. Really a neat place! Huge with alot of cool areas to hang out and eat /drink/play. Its bright and comfy! Our service was good..no complaints. My husband and I shared their Pub burger/fries with a side of ranch dressing which they make there. It was different  and we enjoyed it with our fries. Lots of neat things on the menu to try and we will definitely be coming back! Will adjust our rating as we go, so far so good!"}
{"text":"The new Culinary Dropout in Tempe is a knockout.

The atmosphere is sharp, yet it retains the warmth and comfiness suitable for rustic gastropub fare. 

In addition to food and drink menus, you'll get a starters checklist and a pencil. The charcuterie and cheese selection is excellent-- it boasts Spanish delicacies like Iberico ham and Marcona almonds. You've also got great treats like roasted beets in a sauce of vinegar or Brussels sprouts with Parmesan and currants.

The rest of the menu is tried and trued at the other locations, and the standard is withheld in Tempe. And-- what's this? Breakfast on the weekends?

Our server Connor made the meal a real delight. 

Congrats to Fox for another hit restaurant."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. Food is good. Especially the fried chicken. Service is horrible. Takes forever to get a drink and some of the waitresses seem to hate their job. Snobby attitudes and all around bad service. I will spend my money elsewhere until they retrain their staff."}
{"text":"I am a big foodie.....try every new place, exotic foods, and outright gross and weird foods! I went to the grand opening of pink taco (which was the place here before cullinary dropout) and thought they were okay for a mexican food restaurant and was excited to hear a new place was opening up when pink taco went out of business.
Needless to say, I went to the grand opening of culinary dropout....and pretzels? really? french fries as appetizers?
I feel that the menu lacks creativity, very basic and bland, and the food, well lives up to its name as \"drop out\".....
With wildfish right next door and modern stake eatery right across, and a  fillaberto's always within reach in AZ, don't see a single reason to go here!
Though my male friends have a particular soft spot for this place, because of the abundance of good looking female servers???
Went here once on grand opening, once for a large party, and would never go back because the food is outright lacking."}
{"text":"beer = awesome!  food = crazy delicious!  ambiance = for hard rock, very chill, very cool, very enjoyable!  really enjoyed this place.  creative take on standard staples.  yesterday's soup is always a great choice.  the burger was charred just right.  all around good place.  came here multiple times during our stay in vegas and with the abundance of spots all around, that speaks volumes."}
{"text":"I had to wait but it was worth it. I put my name in, and got a text with a link to check the status of my wait. I received a text when my table was ready giving me a chance to wander Scottsdale Fashion Square while I waited. The service I received was grand and attentive. The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and love the food and atmosphere. Service was great , will be coming back here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Have to say that I don't write many reviews because there always seems to be something wrong because perfection simply doesn't exist. Well, that all changed today at Culinary Dropout inside the Hard Rock Las Vegas. 

For those who have never been, don't let the name fool you. Whatever culinary school you dropped out of was probably not advanced enough to keep up with your creativity. The Korean Ribeye Steak suggested by our server Jenny was flawless. Perfectly seasoned and brilliantly executed, it left you wanting nothing. Would've posted a pic, but one bite became two, and the rest is history. 

Fish and chips were probably some of the bat I've ever had. Extremely light batter, perfectly prepared as I've come to suspect is the norm here. Crazy good. 

And let's not for Jenny, our server for the evening. Super charming and extremely attentive, she was spot on. From the complicated beer order of my friend to the small requests of salt and pepper, she was always there a smile. The perfect server for the perfect restaurant. 

One word to sum it all up, WOW."}
{"text":"I thought the atmosphere was excellent, lively, fun and inviting. Hostess, waitstaff all friendly! Good was average at nest. The pretzels with fondue were tasty but not exceptional. The cheese on the grilled cheese sliders seemed to be American cheese which I wouldn't have expected and the meat on the Mac burger was way under cooked, and I mean raw ish. My kale Ceasar with crispy shrimp was good and the pierogies at our table looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing vibes with beards and even more amazing food.  Will keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I have been to Culinary Dropout several times, for happy hour or dinner. Excellent food, especially the pretzels and cheese! The menu is limited, but there is always something new to try. The service is always great, and the atmosphere is lively."}
{"text":"We had a late lunch here at about 2pm; the place was pretty busy, and the music was a little too loud. However, all of the employees were extremely friendly and helpful. 

The pretzel fondue was excellent; I think we could have been happy with just that. We had the buffalo chicken meatballs, which were good, and the fish and chips, which was good but unexceptional. I would definitely eat here again, but maybe sit on the patio, where it seemed to be quieter."}
{"text":"Good food and a nice atmosphere. The snacks were good size starters and didn't feel like a whole meal. My steak was cooked perfectly and the turkey pastrami is super delicious. Our server told us everything is prepared in house and it shows. It felt like a nice fresh meal."}
{"text":"My best friend Mandy and I decided to give Culinary Dropout a whirl before heading home to work on an exam. It was thursday last week, so my review is a little late. The place has a cool, unique decor. Kind of punk-like with a smattering of glam. Anyhow, the waitress came over and we had a bit of a problem ordering drinks. Well i didnt, but Mandy did since they were out of/did not carry a few of the options Mandy was looking into. The waitress went as far as to say \"I feel like I am dissapointing you over and over.\" Yikes. 

I ordered the Gnocci, and Mandy got the French Dip. My Gnocci was just okay, nothing spectacular. Mandy said her French Dip was to die for. Next time I go in I fully intend on trying their meat/cheese menu, it looks like they have quite a selection. 

That being said, our first visit was kind of hit or miss, but I do want to go back and try it again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and beautiful people!

Went last night Friday to celebrate a bday dinner of a friend who invited me.  They were able to accommodate our large group and served us at a reasonable pace.  The food was delicious; burgers, raviolli, salmon, just about everything looked fresh and smelled fantastic.  The drinks are strong and their tap beers are good.  

Live music was a plus.  Perfect college restaurant."}
{"text":"Really surprised at the total of 3 1/2 stars.  I always get a good meal and good service at Culinary Dropout; the location is great and the ambience is even better.  Haven't been in awhile but Culinary Dropout is one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"The Happy Hour is a great deal. Our server, Carissa, made suggestions of food items. She was attentive and friendly. The pretzels with fondue were a good recommendation. The chopped salad was delicious. We also had the chicken and shrimp on a stick and the cheese plate. Good eats and cheap drinks."}
{"text":"This place has terrible service. Our waitress was the worst! No eye contact when greeting us. Hardly checked on us. There were 9 of us & our food was delivered in spurts. I'm giving it 1 star because the food was good, once it got there."}
{"text":"My god... Where to even begin. The vibe and ambiance in this restaurant is absolutely incredible with elegant lighting meeting urban garage. The service was nothing short of outstanding. Our waitress' name was Maddison.. And let me tell you she was incredible. She was so friendly, fast, efficient, and had our drinks out and ready to us right as we were finishing our previous ones. Then the food... We got the pretzel and fondue appetizer. My god. There's no words for it because it left me speechless. To die for!!! Then all of us ordered the fired chicken.. Again. Speechless. This restaurant is one of a kind, awesome for parties, and really good prices for the quality of food that is served. Maddison definitely deserves a raise, promotion, or definite recognition. I would say everyone needs to try this revolutionary restaurant. Congrats Culinary Dropout.. 10/10.

{"text":"Staying at the hard rock hotel and I had the pleasure of enjoying some drinks here. The service was perfect, I was served by Bo and he did an awesome job, very friendly guy, incredibly helpful and fun. Overall made it a very pleasurable experience I'll definitely be back here anytime I'm in town"}
{"text":"Recently had dinner at the Culinary Dropout and was very impressed.  The ambiance just takes you to a different place and the menu is wonderful and varied.  I had the french onion soup and beef stroganoff.  Both very tasty although the onion soup was a little sweet for my palette.  We decided to follow up the meal with the carmel corn and wow, what a treat.  This is a fun restaurant and the food is good.  A great night out."}
{"text":"Heaven on earth... they have the best Burratta!
 If you are not familiar with this lovely cheese order it immediately and close your eyes as the velvet melts in your mouth. i routinely stop into this restaurant and enjoy their dynamic menu! It changes upon seasons and honestly everything is delightful!

The best time is just before happy hour around 4:30pm.,You can select the best seat in the house, ask the waiter to describe in detail their mouth watering offerings then wait for the people watching to commence!

Never a bad experience and the wait staff is very attentive and on-point!

See y'all sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food but good service
I've heard a lot about this restaurant on Facebook about it being the new in place to hang out and catch a game. 
The setting is great! It's an unusual one having a restaurant in an old warehouse. A cool location for sure. However, the main ingredient is missing (pun intended): the food is not That good. Mediocre is best. 
The service on the other hand was great. Our server was attentive and courteous and fast. 
We got the food fast but fries were a bit too crunchy in other words, burned pretty much. 
The wings were blah. 
The place does have lots of nice seating areas to catch a game."}
{"text":"The pretzel fondue was awesome. Really fun restaurant!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for dinner with a group while staying at the the Hard Rock. Service was great, both our hostess and server went out of their way to help answer our questions. The Turkey Pastrami was great, so was the fried chicken and pretty much every thing else that came out to the table. I got a few oysters which turned out  to be way better then expected as were the pretzel bites. 

As far as drinks go, you can slum it with tallboys of your favorite generic beers (PBR, MGD etc) or order a specialty cocktail - I had one of both and no complaints. 

I'm not in Vegas that often so I probably won't come back but if I do find myself hungry and playing at the hard rock casino I'd probably stop in for a meal."}
{"text":"The Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue appetizer was really good. Although I may be biased as I am not one to refuse warm bread dipped in melted cheese. Thanks to the past reviewers that recommended it. My entree was the Chicken Curry, which was also great. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Three stars for my very first visit. 

Three of us came around 6:30pm on Saturday, about 15mins wait for a table inside, I guess its pretty standard for any place in old town. The waitress was nice enough to share the drink menu and got us ordered some drinks while waiting. We had the Simple Plan, the Home-de Martini, and Acai Mojito. All were pretty good, but a bit pricey ($10 each)

So here comes the food. We ordered the Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue, the first couple of bites were great, but it got dry and tasteless after three, and for softness, honestly, I'd rather go for the $3 Wetzels Pretzel. I had the Smoked Chicken Salad, friends had the Italian Chopped Salad and the Short Rib Pasta. Both salads were good, but not that outstanding. However, we all liked the pasta, it was very flavorful yet kinda soupy. Very good! We took the waitress's recommendation and ordered the Apply Monkey Bread (you're probably thinking the same thing as we did), Monkey bread? So it's basically small bites of cinnamon roll with small chunks of apple paired with  vanilla ice cream. It was very sweet and rich, three of us couldn't finish one plate...If you can't take a lot of sweet and pretty full, then do NOT order it.

The ambience is casual, spacious, and pub-style, but the music on Saturday night was too loud, we felt that we had to scream at each cross the table..."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch while in town on New Years Day with my aunt and a cousin.
**The atmosphere was great-- the chairs are fun and comfy-- you want to curl up and hang out!  The chandeliers are beautiful, and the Edison light bulbs are retro industrial and fun.
**The service was excellent-- our waitress was helpful and nice-- she answered our questions and made great recommendations.
**The food was delicious!-- We started with the pretzel fondue, and for someone who usually steers clear of too many carbs, I definitely had my share!  My cousin had the chicken curry and loved it-- she was still talking about it the following day!  My aunt and I both had the winter salad-- the flavors were outstanding and I would definitely order it again!

I can't wait to be back in Scottsdale-- I'll be visiting Culinary Dropout again and definitely having a cocktail in one of their exquisite chairs!"}
{"text":"We just ate there and 4 out of 11 had sea food and now we are all sick bad food poisoning maybe heavy metal poisoning ...on our way to the e.r."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with eccentric vibe. Got the Gorgonzola Chicken Salad, very refreshing on a sizzling day. Staff all around were super nice! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Well I'll say one thing from the get go, they named this place perfectly.  My friend and I came here for dinner, and while the atmosphere was nice, and the service was good, the food left a lot to be desired.

We ordered an antipasti plate with a meat, cheese, and the crusty bread and olive oil, which were fine, but what sucked was that they brought it out at the same time as our mains!  It's called an antipasti for goodness sakes, it's supposed to come out Before the main course.

Another issue was with the mains.  My friend had the Bistro Steak, and he ordered it medium rare, but we're both pretty sure that it came out rare, but it was so covered in sauce that it was hard to tell.  It was also cool when it came out, which was weird.  I had the pork belly cubano sandwich, which was tasty, but super oily.  I'm pretty sure they cooked the bread on the griddle with butter, because while the edges were crunchy, the center was still a little soggy and greasy.  I also wish they had used more of the spicy mustard and pickles, because after the pork belly, those two were my favorite parts of the sandwich.

Overall, 3 stars for service and ambiance, and 2 stars for food."}
{"text":"I would have given it a 5....would have.
The food is off the charts good.  Pretzels, Italian sandwich, fried chicken, and the awesome grilled cheese sliders are all my favorites.  
BUT.....
one of my cousins ordered a soft drink with his meal.  we ordered ALOT of food so we were there awhile, so he had quite a few refills.  Server was on the ball, she'd go fill it up even if it was only 2/3rds empty.  At the end of the day (bill).  He was charged for 6 softdrinks at upwards of $2.50 a piece.  Besides not mentioning in the menu or by the waitress....to charge full refills for not empty cups, just wow.  

pay attention...no free refills here, and guard your cup with your life if its not empty.  
Other than that... YUM!"}
{"text":"The pretzels are a must. Coolest staff ever. Great food and would come again. I'm vegetarian, but wld still come again"}
{"text":"This place is fun! The atmosphere is amazing and there is live music on the weekend. Try the fondue pretzels or the antipasta plate. They have happy hour too."}
{"text":"happy hour is m-f 3-6p. the paper bag beer special for under $2. surprise its PBR. they say it changes up and that PBR is probably one of the better ones.

if money is not an issue they have a really good beer selection including my favorite La Fin du Monde. 

didnt have a chance to try the hh food but the prices looked okay. might go back accidentally some day."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food! It is a bit expensive, but the food is really good.
Great ambiance kind of laid back.
Real nice people working here, service is really good. Good beer available and changes often.
Get the fried chicken, its good"}
{"text":"I could not believe we were served this cheese plate. Worst cheese plate ever served. No crackers on top of it! I thought maybe someone screwed up. I asked to speak to the Manager who looked about 25 years old. He said it is the correct amount that they serve, but they serve it on a smaller plate. Seriously!!!? Granted, it was happy hour, but I don't care what it is, this is unacceptable. I will say the pretzels and cheese fondue were very good though. Someone in management needs to see this and do something about it. I can't believe anyone accepts this is ok to be served. The decor and location were great! I guess my picture will have to be done separate."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really, really fun. Great atmosphere, fun crowd, really great food. The provolone fondue with pretzel balls is amazing.

We were a large group of girls, and had a bit of a snotty server. We also had a pretty big issue with the timing of the food service. So why five stars? Because when the manager saw that we weren't pleased, he went way, way above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Our night went from questionable service, to seriously one of greatest in a matter of minutes, all because the manager cared to make the difference.

Its things like that, that makes one restaurant stand out from another. I will go back again and again. Love the place, so impressed."}
{"text":"STaff is amazing. The bartender suggested the French dip(prime rib)  by far the best I have ever had. Keep doing  it right gang."}
{"text":"atmosphere is really cool. nice patio, nice chairs inside...my friend and I ate on patio. we ordered a salad. (sorry, but when I think of salad as a meal, I think BIG..like cheescake facotry) the salad came out and we looked at eachother like \"wheres the rest of it? YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. and it was $13. NOOOOOOO. I 'd be embarrased to send that out of my kitchen. (The ppl next to us were having cheese burgers, that looked good.) I had to order something else, the fondu/pretzel app was pretty good!!"}
{"text":"As always I love culinary drop out. Normally I have the sweet potato canneloni but I learned this past weekend that is a winter dish. They switched it out with sweet corn. But to my surprise I loved the sweet corn as well... There pretzel bites with fondue cheese is to die for!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We went on a Tuesday night around 6:30 and waited for about 40 minutes but I will say one thing, it was worth the wait. I usually refuse to wait anywhere but seeing the food walk by I could see this was someplace special. Right off we started with a meat and cheese platter. The meat was sliced on point and the cheddar was creamy. We ordered our entrees. I had the fried chicken which was probably the best I have ever eaten. My co-worker got the meatloaf and he totally loved it. The service was great and the food was superb. This is where you want to eat in Tempe."}
{"text":"went straight to the bar. food was awesome. the bartender on duty was amazing! his name is matt. even though they were extremely busy, he found time to make jokes and had us laughing practically the entire time. i recommend coming here around brunch time cause the atmosphere is def a good one"}
{"text":"Since this restaurant opened I have been here 4 times.  I have had a perfect experience every time!  There are just not enough good things to say about this restaurant.  Every detail has been thought out.  I have gotten something different every time.  But the cheese platter and fresh potato chips with wine could be a meal in itself.  Awesome service, very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list.
I will be back!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, always for lunch with vendors/clients. My experience is that it has been good but not great. They have a good selection of options to choose from. The decor is simple but upscale with a modern loft feel. The staff is friendly, quick & attractive. 
Today I had the Crispy Shrimp Caesar Salad. A good salad but it didn't knock my socks off & I'll probably order something else next time I come for lunch."}
{"text":"Beautiful food presentation and great service.   It's a large place and packed with people...so it can get noisy.

For an appetizer... the soft pretzel and fondue provolone, was tasty.  Maybe too filling.

The Caesar salad was the best I have ever had.   Salmon was delicious.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you're considering trying this place out DON'T!  The management is rude, the ambience is bad and the prices are out of line for portion and quality."}
{"text":"We have visited this place twice and both times the food was good but the service not so much. We will try it again because the atmosphere is fun and the food is good and hopefully the service catches up!!"}
{"text":"Many restaurants prepare great food in a great atmosphere. But this place stands out because of the people who work there. Many thanks to Grace, Pelita, Alex and Blake. Especially to Grace and Pelita.  Let me tell you. Not only will these folks take care of you to make sure you come back, they will watch your back. Have fun at the culinary drop out."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I love how they put a spin on classic comfort food and make it their own. Well done!"}
{"text":"Walked in, made a reservation. Walked to the bar and politely  and asked the bartender (Casey) what they had to drink on tap. He then responded by saying \"beer\" rudely tossing a menu In front of me. I waited for him to return, ordered my beer and he turned around with no response or acknowledgment of my order and returned a few minutes later with my beer. He then stood there staring a me until I asked him how much I owed him. He then responded with \" over 5 and under 10.\" I immediately responded by asking if he was serious and he told me he would print me out a receipt so I could \"figure it out\". I then walked away after paying and waited to be seated with my girlfriend while the bartender (Casey) proceeded to stand at the bar smiling in a condescending manner and speaking with co workers about our unpleasant exchange.  I would recommend avoiding the bartenders unless you enjoy being treated like absolute crap by the unkept bartender that literally looked as if he had just woke up, skipped a shower and had not groomed himself properly In weeks. Other than that the band was good, our server was cool, and the food was decent. Overall. Not stoked. I would hve rather hit up the food court inside the mall for some Panda Express!"}
{"text":"Food is hit or miss for how expensive this place is. The quality can be pretty good and sometimes they drop the ball."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very inviting and the set-up was nice. However, since it was a weekend they had live music inside which made it very loud that it was hard to here each other let alone our server. All in all the food was good. Only complaint was the sweet corn ravioli was pretty tough to bite it's almost like it was little undercooked. Besides that I would come here again the drinks were fantastic! I recommend the Soiled Dove if you like tequila but who doesn't."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, and games (table tennis, corn hole). The cheese fondue appetizer is a must when coming here. Really good sandwiches (what my entree was) & I headonly good things from the rest of my table about their entrees. 
We had some people under 21 in our party, so we couldn't stay in the gaming area (corn hole/table tennis) past 6pm. This is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. Why can't they make it 8pm like other establishments around town? 
I will continue to come here, but not with people under 21 if we're going to stay past 6pm. It's not fair to them."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the pretzel bun on their turkey pastrami but they switched it out rot away and the rest was heaven!  The bourbon cake was melt in your mouth!  My boyfriend had the pub burger and i tried some,  it was also delicious! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to my first dining experience here and what a disappointment. The atmosphere and service were excellent but the food and drinks(watered down) were horrible. The desert was like something from a high school cafeteria. I expected more from a Fox establishment. The bill for the three of us was $100. Should have gone to mcDonalds.

Gave this place another try after they reached out to try and get my feedback on how to improve the experience.  So I went back and the food was great and the service was fantastic plus you can't beat the location. Highly recommend now!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is a fantastic restaurant. There is a good amount of tables and it's not too pricey for a downtown Scottsdale restaurant. My #1 piece of advice: TRY THE FONDUE PRETZEL BITES. They are incredible. The fondue comes in a little kettle kept warm by a lit candle on the base of the vessel. The presentation for all the food and drinks was great. For my main meal I had the pork ribs, which were fantastic. I've also heard nothing but great things about the meatloaf as well! There are of course many many spirits to choose from as well. To top everything off the wait staff was incredibly friendly and a joy to be served by. The vision for the restaurant is clearly displayed and proven to the customer. The next time I'm in Scottsdale I'll be sure to return here."}
{"text":"The place is awesome. We went there to celebrate my mom's birthday. The food and service was excellent, and the atmosphere was great. If you stop by, say hello to the manager, Clancy. He's cool and will make sure the staff takes good care of you. The live music is outstanding. We could have stayed the whole night."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The servers are fun and the food is delishious."}
{"text":"Had a friend in town visiting from California. There are so many places to go and check out in Phoenix and Scottsdale area and I wanted to take him to one of my favorite places. I never really write reviews but my friend was so impressed and loved this place he encouraged me to. The food was absolute amazing but one of the reason I come in there is to see Sara the bartender.  I think her last name starts with an S. She always has this bright smile on her face and laughing and welcoming. Love that she remembers my name and face and says hello. 
She went through the menu with my friend and made some great suggestions on what to order. He picked the Ribs and I got the Korean Ribeye. Both were delicious. Sara was quick with the order and getting us our drinks. Never had an empty glass and she was on top on everything the whole time. 
I am a big foodie person but the main reason I go back to places is because of the service I receive. I will come back and def make this place a suggestion mainly because of the customer service I receive from Sara."}
{"text":"Well to give you some background information on myself, I am a server and I have been in the restaurant industry for over 5 years. I went to Culinary Dropout with my family on a Sunday evening. This was quite a trip for us because we all live in the ahwatukee area, so that is about a 30-35 minute drive on the freeway. We were all excited about coming to culinary dropout, and some of our group had already been here before. Well sadly this experience was far from great. First of all, it took about 15 minutes for our table to be greeted, and then about 15 minutes more for us to receive our drinks. About a half hour later the last two of our group showed up, and then they had to ask a manager for help before any of us EVEN SAW our server. We order shots for the whole table and that was a huge hassle. You would think that if you had a table of 8, and they are willing to spend a lot of money at your restaurant you would make sure they were taken care of, but no. And too make things a worse it was hard to tell if they were even running the A/C.  It is the end of May in Arizona so of course its going to be hot. But when i go to a nice restaurant and expect to pay a good amount of money, i shouldn't be sweating through the entire meal. When we ordered our food that luckily all came quickly, and it was all very delicious. The food was okay, and I wasn't very impressed. I ordered the meatloaf, and that was good, but anyone can up ketchup on meatloaf and its delicious! My fiance got the the turkey pastrami sandwich it was good,  but mostly it tasted like a normal turkey sandwich, but the side salad with ranch was delicious! Sadly the service or lack there of, really made the whole experience more frustrating rather then enjoyable. We were there for over 2 hours and saw our server about 3-4 times. She seemed very overwhelmed with the tables she had to serve. It honestly seemed that she had too big of a section for one server to handle. Maybe ill give this place another chance for a date, but never again for a larger group of people. Just be warned if you come here it will take a while for anything!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bachelorette party dinner #1 for 7 girls = success!

Came here on a Friday night and it was packed.  Luckily, we came at 9:15, so only had to wait about 15 min.  We stayed at the W hotel so it's only a 5-10 minute walk, very convenient.  This place had a cool vibe (half bar/half restaurant-like atmosphere) and the acoustics of the place was perfect for the live band.  The restaurant decor is very unique, not like any restaurants in SF or LA, so just for that alone I'd recommend this place.  Service was great, there were beautiful ppl everywhere, and our waitress was SUPER nice  (we got comp'd for a lot of our drinks! thank YOU bride!).

Wonder if the chefs are really culinary dropouts - regardless, the food was pretty damn good!  MUST GET THE SWEET CORN CANNELONI! OMG.  seriously.. OMG.  4 people at our table ordered that entree and we all cleared our plates faster than anyone else.  The prices were very reasonable (with dinner+drinks+tax+tip, each person paid around $25).  

I just wish they took reservations!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for awhile, so I took my mom for mother's day.  I made a reservation via open table, for 3 pm the Saturday before.  It's a great space.  Lots of indoor and outdoor seating, and not your typical tables.  Big, comfy chairs and big tables.  Music was louder than what should be at 3 pm, suggesting a night club atmosphere, and with the big tables, it was hard to hear conversation.  Food was \"fantastic\" as my 15 year old daughter said.  She had the fried chicken.  My husband ordered the meatloaf, which he said was almost as good as my mom's.  :)  Since she was dining with us, that was more to save face, I think.  I ordered the kale salad with grilled chicken, which I thought tasted like a True Food salad.  (exactly what I would want)  My dad had the french dip, he enjoyed it.  My mother ordered the gorgonzola salad, with grilled chicken.  This is where it gets....not so good.

Her salad came with lettuce and chicken.  No cheese.  We looked for our waiter for quite some time, and finally flagged down a hostess.  Our waiter came back, only to explain that the cheese is mixed in with a chicken \"salad\" and since she ordered grilled chicken, they don't mix the cheese in with that.  He could give her some cheese, but it would be an up charge.  My mom is 70, and with that age comes a bit of frugality.  She knew I was paying for lunch, but didn't want me to get charged and \"up charge\" for it, so she got a little....mad.  The waiter brought over the cheese sauce they use for the chicken salad, and she put it on her salad and liked that.  There wasn't an up charge for the sauce.  

A little bit of drama that didn't need to happen.  From both parties, IMO."}
{"text":"Last night my girl friend threw a birthday dinner for her boyfriend at Culinary Dropout.  We had a table of about 10 people, and it was nice to find that they took reservations and had a great table ready for us when we arrived.  I didn't have dinner (already ate) but I did enjoy the soft pretzel and fondue that everyone raves about!  I absolutely loved the idea of the \"Paper Bag Special\" beer.  It's only $1.95 and they bring you the beer of their choice in a small paper bag.  (I was lucky enough to get my favorite, a PBR!)  

The reason for my 3 star is that I didn't particularly love the atmosphere or the decor of the restaurant.  Didn't really give me a fun, \"come back and dine with us again\" vibe.  It was nice for a large party, but I don't envision going there on a date or just with a co-worker or girl friend.  

I did see they had a stage set up for live music, I think only takes place on the weekends, I would like to go back and see how that changes the scene."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and relaxed vibe of the place.  Also like that they text you when your table is ready so you don't have to stick super close while waiting.  The hostess and waitresses were nice and the food was good.  The fries were my favorite, the French dip sandwich was alright, but not worth the price.  I wish I'd picked something less bland.  My friend had the pub burger and said it was great.  The wingback chairs we sat in were comfortable and unexpected in a restaurant.  I want to go back and listen to one of their live music nights. Was a fun new place to try."}
{"text":"check out the special!
I was there on Saturday June 15, 5 pm, asked for a quiet part of the place for 3 people, got it right away.  our server was really great, sorry, can't remember her name, but she explained everything, she was like a ballerina, loved her.  The $20 special is great:appetizer, entree, and a drink.  We liked the bruschetta, salmon and shrimp salads, way too much food, very pleasant.  next time I would split a salad, they are big and delicious.  Sam Fox, where do you get those cheerful, helpful servers?"}
{"text":"Another outstanding triumph for Mr. Fox, Culinary Dropout is as good as it gets at Camelback and Scottsdale. Go for the pretzel ball fondue and the incredible caramel popcorn custard desert! Everything in between is 5-stars too. Great ambiance, excellent cuisine - one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I initially wrote a post about my bad experience but please read the addendum below because it truly reflects how much these people care. Truly amazing people work here and they really really care about you. 

EDIT: Within a few hours of writing my post I received a quick response from the general manager apologizing for the AC and experience. It was mentioned that they would be adding more AC units and that they would be handling other issues as well. In all honest this is what I call great service, people who are aware of the voice of the customer and I greatly appreciate this which is why I edited my rating to reflect this. Culinary Dropout has definitely earned a second chance! 

The service is also very great and they do offer free Valet as well which is always a bonus. The ambiance and the lighting is also great for dates or it can be as casual as hanging out with your friends in shorts during the day in the outdoor area. Definitely a fun place."}
{"text":"Pretzels and cheese are a must! So good. Drinks are different but good. Food is great. Service was great even though it is usually busy. Free Valet parking although you should tip the driver."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great atmosphere! Accommodating staff! What more could you want? Everything our group ordered was very appealing and fresh looking and tasting! This was my second time here, both times were great!"}
{"text":"I had my first experience with Culinary Dropout today, during my lunch hour. It came highly recommended from some co-workers, so I was excited to check it out and enjoy a good lunch.

Food: we had the pretzel fondue for an appetizer, which was a nice treat because I don't order fondue often. I followed this with a turkey pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun, which was amazing and different (although a tad messy, but it was so great I didn't care). Another thing I Iiked was that they didn't overload the plate with fries, like most places do...the sandwich came with just the right amount...and those were good!

It was fairly busy, but not packed. We received great service from our server, and it looked like they had plenty of staff to tend to the other tables. Oh and one other thing: our server was actually friendly, something that is not commonplace in that part of town. The manager (I'm guessing) actually came by, and checked in with us to make sure we we're enjoying our lunch...and he was friendly as well.

I'll definitely be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hours! Busy on the weekends, but a chill place to hang out during the week. Great deals on appetizers (especially the pretzels and fondue, an absolute MUST)

They also have games to play like ping pong and corn hole. Just all around a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"WAY OVER PRICED! I ordered the steak and they brought me out a tiny little thing they called meat. I can't remember what I paid but I would have been better off going to Safeway and getting a nice piece of Ribeye for cheaper. There are so many places around Dropout that provide better for the same price. The parking gets really bad too. Be aware."}
{"text":"Proof that you can market and sell anything with a catchy name. Lame happy hour, flavorless food, inattentive staff that's trying to look like an American apparel add. If this wasn't a Fox concept in the heart of Old Town it would of closed its doors 6 months ago."}
{"text":"This is the 4th time I've come here, and the food has always been great. the salads as well as the entrees are all delicious, even the kale salad! The salt caramel  custard is to die for, so save room for dessert. I gave the place 4 stars only because its SO loud in there, you cant hear the people sitting across the table from you. Will definitely b going back."}
{"text":"So we all decided to do Sunday Funday a day early... since it was a warm sunny day. We started off our day at Olive & Ivy... then Modern Steak... and somehow ended up where Pink Taco used to be. I have been to the Vegas Pink Taco at the Hard Rock, but never the one here in Scottsdale. So I have no idea what this place was like before, but I have to say I immediately thought the the interior decor with the gothic yet modern design w/ the elaborate chandeliers was really cool. I love the large open window / doors open to fun inviting patio. 
There was a live band playing... pretty sure It was the same band playing at Olive & Ivy earlier. We did not eat... just had amazing Greyhounds... fresh squeezed grapefruit w/ Kettle.... very refreshing. The food menu looked good, but smelling and seeing the entrees of those around us was  tempting. But we were focused on no more added unwanted calories unless it consisted of alcohol. We were suppose to go home and get ready to head out again on Sat night... but it was difficult to stop having fun... so it was like being in Vegas w/ my friends...minus the gambling and Pink Taco:)"}
{"text":"Beer is kinda pricey. Had the fish n chips; excellent! Son had the grilled cheese sliders & he loved it. The cole slaw was very bland. No Wi Fi, nice atmosphere, quick to get the food, staff nice n quick. Will come back."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Great beer and we really enjoyed the food. Great ambiance a it the place. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is a well known spot in the area and it certainly doesn't disappoint. To start, I like the classic Moscow Mule. For an appetizer the pretzel bread with fondue is a no brainer. For lunch, our table split a couple of things including the corn ravioli (sounds weird but actually INCREDIBLE!) and fried chicken (has honey drizzled on top and is impeccable). Need I say more?!?"}
{"text":"Great ambiance! And if there's anywhere you're going to splurge on carb overload, this is definitely the place to do it with their pretzel bites and fondue."}
{"text":"Get there early! Just as the name has you presume, you can \"check-out\" yard games; they have paddles and balls for ping-pong and Foosball or cornhole sets to play in their covered/enclosed but outdoor patio areas. Tip: try the paper bag special - you pay $1.95 and they pick a random beer and hand it to you, yes, covered in a paper bag.

P.S. Try the pretzel bites with cheese fondue."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to enjoy Happy Hour in downtown Scottsdale and Culinary Dropout came at the suggestion of the Concierge at the Valley Ho.

Having never been there before, we decided to give it a try, but unfortunately don't ever see ourselves  returning.  We just didn't get a good vibe from the place from the minute we walked in -  (very stark and non descriptive in decor) and it was virtually empty with the exception of a few tables the entire time we were there.

While the bartender was nice - he was very young and inexperienced.  We ordered the Manchego cheese and Capiccola from the happy hour menu and a bottle of Malbec.  Flavoring of both cheese and Capiccola were very good. 

Bartender encouraged to try the Fried Chicken, which he touted as their most popular entree - but we declined and decided to keep on our exploration of another local restaurant we'd yet to try.

They may also be dealing with a sewer problem.  I used the restroom and the smell in there was atrocious!

Appears to be a place that might cater to the young Scottsdale crowd wannabees."}
{"text":"A resounding \"meh\". Great place for a group to drink and play games but I was totally underwhelmed by the food. Pretzels did not have the right texture and were more like bread rolls than anything else, butternut squash pasta was undercooked and had practically no flavors other than the sweetness of the squash. I'd come back to give other menu items a shot but my first go around was really unimpressive."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner.  Have to try the pretzel balls and cheese. Nice selection of cocktails and food all made on site.  Honey fried checked was spot on.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout was a great experience. Our waitress was very personable, and she had many recommendations.  It was nice because it was just off the strip, so not very crowded, but we were very early (5pm) because of a show.  There was a nice outdoor patio, too.  The roasted beets were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try but super disappointed !! Service was horrible food was ok . The interior was beautifully decorated that was worth the visit ! Went in before a show and had to track our server down just to get out of there!!! Same with drinks and food waited a loooong time for everything !!!"}
{"text":"It was WAY too loud to have dinner conversation.  Our server was teetering between intrusively-attentive and rushing us (I was not able to determine his intention and it made me feel rushed and uneasy.)

The food was only fair.  

The decor and seating were excellent.  I would try it again and hope for an easy-going server, lower music volume and better food. Maybe we just had bad luck."}
{"text":"I went here tonight with my coworkers and It was overall enjoyable. The food is very good, the waiter was very nice and the atmosphere is fun. The decor is very cool although it is dark in there. The music is load but i liked it. My only complaint is the dessert menu. They have these different ones but absolutely nothing with chocolate! I told the waiter I was going to yelp about it so I am. Not even a brownie! That was upsetting. But cool place to eat at overall. OH and good bloody mary's!!"}
{"text":"I finally made it out to this place, and I'm so glad I did. I heard it was a good restaurant, but it surpassed my expectations. Very hip and energetic atmosphere. All of the servers were friendly and I felt very comfortable there. The soft pretzels and cheese fondue are a Must Have. So delicious! And their drink menu is ridiculously awesome. So many unique drinks."}
{"text":"This has become one of our regular lunch options on the weekend. The pretzels and fondue are awesome, and the little house salad is an unexpected treat. Monkey bread is delicious, though we rarely have space for it!! The menu items we've tried, we've liked!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Ribeye, surprisingly good brussels sprouts.  Potatoes cooked to perfection, and a great beer selection...what more can you ask for?  Service was good, definitely a happening place if you ware looking to socialize.  It can be on the loud side, if you are looking for a quiet place, this might not be for you.  

I ate here twice on a recent business trip, and no one in our group had anything left on their plates.  Everyone was very pleased with their meals."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for hanging out, but probably not the best spot for a romantic dinner.  I really Love the Bloody Marys. I crave them all the time. The antipasti options are awesome. I'm really looking to going back the next time I'm in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try CD last Saturday night and it was great!  We started with the homemade potato chips and Smoked Salmon which were both EXCELLENT and moved on to the pork ribs, salmon, gnocchi and a burger.  My family and I have a tradition to share the first bite with each other and wow... they have a winner here.  I am not a huge fan of some of the other Fox restaurants, but this is a winning combo.  Great price/value and the service was spot on.   Can't wait to go back this weekend!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout....I now understand your name. At first I believed it to mean \"I was so good in school that I decided to drop out and start a restaurant instead of wait for the degree,\" now I know it really means \"I sucked in school and decided to drop out rather than fail and then start a restaurant where I can trick people into thinking they're eating delicious pub food while really I'm just serving a bunch of frozen stuff and premade sauces.\" It's not worth what they charge. If you insist on trying this place please only go during a happy hour..."}
{"text":"I LOVE the pretzel balls and cheese. The entrees aren't all that great. I had the fried chicken which wasn't very good. The ribs are great and the meatloaf is great. Otherwise, not that into it. But the service is pretty good and the drinks are decent."}
{"text":"We had a party of 11 for a bachelorette party. We had Ryan as our server and he was amazing. Everything was fast, the food was amazing and he split our checks just as we asked. When I come back I will always request him!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Took 40 just for a cup of coffee. When my food finally came out after way too long of a wait, my food was ice cold. Over priced for small portions. I had the french toast. Cold french toast is disgusting. How the hell am I gonna be served Grilled Bread and the bread is just as cold as my ice water. I literally saw my food on the counter and sit there for 15 min before brought to my table. The waitress was completely careless to my table. Hell naw to this place!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the establishment. I came in with a party of 12. We were properly dressed and we are GUESTS here at the Hard Rock Hotel. The hostess did NOT want to seat us at a table and the Bartenders at the bar would not make our drinks because we did not have a table. We were ignored for almost 20mins before someone came to speak with us. 

Once our waiter came, he had a SNOBBY attitude, was very rude and short when answering our questions. We ordered 3 house salads that took almost 1 hour to get to our table. The additional Ceasar salad we ordered was WILTED. The waitress had a problem with taking it back to the chef. No one wants an old salad. All of our appetizers came to the table out of order and to the wrong person. 

I will NEVER dine here again and I will make sure I let other people know to not visit this place either. They need to have a serious talk with their wait staff. Customers coming in to spend MONEY shouldn't be treated this way. Before leaving I spoke with the Manager Tony. He appologized, attempted to rectify the situation and was very nice."}
{"text":"First time here. In short-
1. Soft pretzel with provolone fondue- excellent. 
2. 32 hour ribs- salty but yum!
3. Salted caramel custard- nothing like I've ever had but I would definitely do it again. 
Bottom line- I should have tried this place earlier, because it'd probably be a place I would go often"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to enjoy many of their menu items today at lunch.  I would HIGHLY recommend their Chicken Curry dish.  Very flavorful!!!"}
{"text":"We were seated promptly and the service was adequate.  The pretzel appetizers were terrific, and the fried chicken was good but at $22 a plate should have been sensational.  Our only real complaint (and one that knocked a full star off the rating) is the level of noise.  They have a musical sound-track playing that is okay, but with sound checks going on in the other adjacent stage areas of the complex that made it feel like we were eating lunch in a nuclear testing range.  Bad enough we won't be returning which probably says everything you need to know right there."}
{"text":"I always give new places 2 tries.  After the 2nd time around, this place was alright.  First visit got the seared tuna salad and it was pretty good.  It had kind of like an Asian gingery kick to it.  Second time got the chicken curry.  It was decent, but was missing rice.  Curry is normally served w/ rice, but thought it was odd that I didn't get rice with it.  Atmosphere is nice especially having a girl's night out or just hanging out w/ a group of people.  Price-wise...it's a bit on the high side for simple food (meaning nothing too special about this place)."}
{"text":"The service is slow at this location. We were seated and no one attended to us for almost 10 minutes and the restaurant wasn't even crowded. Once we left the dining area to the bar it was the same situation. The bartender didn't even acknowledge we were sitting there waiting to be attended to for 5 minutes. Once we got drinks the bartender didn't even come back to us until about 10 minutes after we finished our drinks, not good..."}
{"text":"My wife had an awesome steak here rivaling even some of the finer steak places throughout the country, but that was the only real highlight.

My shrimp Caeser salad had no flavor whatsoever. I had to ask for some lemon to add to it to make it edible.

The seating was uncomfortable, though the dining atmosphere was good.

Service was just average."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I usually always go to the culinary in Scottsdale but our friend recommended we need to go to the culinary in Tempe. Right when we walked in I could understand why! So beautiful!! Right when we walked in we were greeted with many smiles and hellos! We got sat and about 1min later our server came by she was so friendly she asked if we have ever been here before and we told her only the Scottsdale one and she smiled and said \"well I'm glad you two came to Tempe today, we are known to have a the best looking staff\" haha it was funny then told her I needed a good summer cocktail! She immediately got down next to me and asked me what flavors I like and which liquor I prefer. She recommended \"The Soild Dove\" WOW best tequila cocktail iv ever had. Then we obviously got the pretzels. I orders a salad and my boyfriend the pub burger but half way through our meals the power shut off.... most restaurants people freak out but the staff was so calm. Which made us calm! Tiffany came over to reassure us everything was fine even cracked a joke so made us not worry to much. But the power did come back on! By the end of our meal she asked us if we need some deserts we originally didn't but she sold us on the \"Smores pudding\" and that definitely hit the spot!!! I really can't wait to bring my friends here! The staff is so great! They all help each other and we noticed that! The food is amazing! And the atmosphere is fun! Five stars for Culinary Tempe!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed. Solid choice of tap beers, active environment, attentive bartenders (always sit at bar so this is important)

I had the Italian Chopped Salad which is plenty hardy and very tasty

I happened to be here for game 5 of the Cubs-Nat's game and there are plenty of tvs (could also keep half an eye on the NFL game)

Good, consistent, fun place every time 

If you haven't been here, go here"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Fox Concepts Restaurants, but not this one.  Not much ambience for me with the industrial look, but others seem to like it so maybe it is personal taste.  Went there for the second time today - this time  for happy hour.  No wine on the happy hour menu and the food offerings were deeply discounted, but sparse.  I had the meatloaf sandwich and finally found the meatloaf after peeling off the huge layer of bread on top.  As a Tempe resident, I am very excited to have this new Fox restaurant and hope it does well, but it is off the beaten path and pricey and will have to compete with other new places like Postino, which offers pitchers of craft beer for $5 and wine for $5/glass until 5 pm plus delicious food and wonderful ambience in the beautifully refurbished  old Annex Building on the ASU campus.

The service was great.  I sat at the bar and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Good luck, Culinary Drop Out.  We want you to succeed."}
{"text":"Service and food excellent. Joel took good care of me and the kids. Pretzel fondue is as good as everyone says. Nice atmosphere. Came for lunch. If I was 20 years younger I'd come back for the live music tonight."}
{"text":"Great environment, casual open yet current vibe with good choices of Moscow mules and charcuterie choices. Had the jalapeño and molasses ribs that were delicious. Request wipes as this will get messy. The Korean style ribeye was ok and meat portion was smaller than expected but vegetable accompaniment was flavorful. Overall fun and good place to try"}
{"text":"Decided to take some work friends out and try this location. It's a beautiful location with two adjoining concepts. The service was cute, attentive with a great attitude. We had the hummus and pretzels. The hummus was ok with an interesting olive tapenade and the pretzels and cheese fondue were delicious. Definitely a good shareable portion. 
For dinner I had the ribs which were highly recommended and delicious. Slightly on the sweeter side but delicious. I must add I ordered a side salad which was similar to a caesar and that was perfect. Often not done well this was a highlight. 
The Manhattan was ok and could have used less ice cubes.
Overall a great garage dive with good food"}
{"text":"Another visit, another great meal.  Man, I love this place.   The soup was excellent and the sandwich... DELISH!   I'm happy every time I visit.   What's that?  Why not 5 stars you ask?  We always go at lunch because it's just too much of a bar scene for my tastes.  I'll leave that scene to you smokin' hot 25 year olds."}
{"text":"so, we were here about a month ago and had probably one of the worst experiences at any restaurant. However, we came back and had a much better experience. 

First of all, we like to thank Mike for inviting us back so we can give this new place a second chance. Secondly, thank you to Alyssa and Erica for making our experience that much better than the first.

Alyssa really knew her food knowledge and was really great at checking up on us. Erica came back several times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and even the food runners knew where to drop off food, which was a challenge for them the last time we were here. Overall, we had a great time and are definitely making this place a go to spot.

Now, on to more important business, the food. Here's the break down:

1st course: Pretzel and cheese fondue and burrata. You can't go wrong with cheese and pretzels, especially when its fondue. Warm pretzel and cheese, definitely a plus. This app is also great for sharing if you're here with a big group. Burrata, OMG! We've had burrata served all sorts of way but it's definitely the best here. Served with toasty bread and chimichurri, what a combination. It's a little sweet and salty and the burrata adds this creamy and cool element, you have to try this when you're here. This is the perfect deconstruction of a caprese salad.

2nd course: Rainbow trout and the Ribeye cap. Rainbow trouts don't  get enough credits if you ask me. This mild white fish is perfect for grilling and pairing with some intense flavors. Here, it is served with some green beans and toasted almonds. The flavor of the fish gets a chance to be the star because the other elements are soft and enhances the flavor instead of overpowering it. But, the star of this course is the Ribeye cap. It was so tendered and all the flavors were wonderful. Asian inspired so you get a little spicy, a little sweet and a little salty. They're already sliced so consuming them was that much easier. If you're a cilantro (coriander), ask for extra. The flavor adds a little bitterness that goes really well with it.

3rd course: Monkey Bread. You all know that I love a good dessert. And this time, we didn't run out of time. It's baked to order so give it a little time to get to your table. It's piping hot when it arrives and you have to eat this with your hands. You pull apart these tiny brioche that is soaked in cinnamon and sugar. It was good. Its a good pull a part version of a cinnamon bun. It was a little too sweet for me so luckily I had some pretty strong coffee to sip on.

Ciao and until next time, happy eating everyone :)"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Culinary Dropout! We had Jack, who is such a sweetheart, and he suggested the perfect food and drinks for us. We had the fried Brussel sprouts, prosciutto and cheese, potato chips with onion dip as appetizers. Then we had fish and chips and Thai wings. EVERYTHING here is RIDICULOUSLY good. Not to mention the drinks are perfectly made. We had the After School Special and a few others I can't remember. For dessert, Jack surprised us with a delicious monkey bread style dessert! Being from California, I get a lot of out of state visitors and I can't wait to bring them all in for a laid back night full of tasty drinks and great food."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's walking distance from my office and our office has now made this the \"official birthday lunch\" spot. The food is always great and the servers are super friendly!"}
{"text":"First time was good - cool place to hang out no parking fee. Second time not so good. 2/3 of parking spaces are deginated as valet parking - valet parking person said if you don't like it park on the street- the bartender required to have a credit card which is understandable but instead of putting credit card and receipt in the cup in front of us- he threw my credit card on the counter. Smiling.if it is his credit card he won't be smiling. I will never return this place. Why is it so hard to find good restaurant in Arizona. And still they are opening w high rating. Did we loose the feelings of being a customer?why does it seem like bartender is the owner of the restaurant not customer? We asked why you asked credit card he said it depends on person to person. Does that mean he doesn't trust us? We will run away with bill. Sorry but if that is how you feel, why should I drive 15 miles together there. I make over 100000 a year I don't need to treat me like that no more this restaurant . Please train your people how to treat your customer. Any busy restaurant or bars if staff is well trained, know you request a credit card and every time customer orders you update the bill and place both credit card and bill in the glass in front of the customer. You said you have a high volume of customers, how do you keep track of which credit card to use if you just place bunch of credit cards on the cash register? This is the first place actually required to keep the credit card on the cash register. So as a customer, how do I know I am being charged right if you are dealing w so many customers w so many bills."}
{"text":"I woukl give zero if u could.  The bearded douche that presented himself as the manager tonight was a total ass. The check came as 43 beers my friend inquired about the check and was escorted out with excessive force. The bar attached to the culinary drop out is a waste of time and I  would spend  my hard earned money  in a  different location"}
{"text":"We ended up here on Saturday night and overall had a great experience!  The wait was a bit over the top, but we solved that problem and went next door for drinks.  What started out as a 15-30 minute wait ended up being almost an hour, but the meal was worth that frustration.  It's very clear that this is one of \"those\" places in Scottsdale, so I'll give it a pass.  ;)

We let our server know that we were in a rush and she was very accommodating. (We had somewhere to be after dinner.)  We had a nice bottle of red wine, had the \"make your own\" antipasti platter, the pretzel fondue, and the monkey bread.  It was awesome!  

First the fondue:  I'm not a HUGE fan of cheese fondue, but I can see why people would like it.  It was good.  The pretzel that went with was good too. 

The cheese/antipasti platter:  YUM.  Decent cheese selection, although they were out of one of the ones we wanted.  We had the tomatoes and one of the meats (capicola and I know I prob spelled that wrong).  So. Good! 

The monkey bread:  I'm not a huge dessert person, but this was REALLY good.  One or two bites were sufficient for me...but the person I was with LOVED it. 

Overall, a good experience and I def hope to be back....hopefully with a fun group friends to share some of the yummy plates with!"}
{"text":"Tried Culinary Dropout for the first time and liked it very much!  They had some really yummy-sounding cocktails, but I tried one of their Mojito's and liked it!  Their antipasto choices are great and you could just make a meal out of a few of those and their great bread.  The sweet corn enchiladas were delicious and their version of the French Dip was just as good.  My only complaint... the wine list is weak."}
{"text":"Favorite spot in Scottsdale. Great food (get the pretzels...), excellent beer selection, nice outdoor seating area to enjoy an Arizona evening. Gets busy, so good to have a backup plan if you're in a hurry on a Friday night, but I'd say it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Checked out Culinary Droput while visiting family in Scottsdale and really enjoyed it!  It was a Sunday and there was no wait.  I thought the decor was very nice and would typically expect higher prices on the menu...both pluses in my book!  Service was wonderful with great reccomendations.  The table started with the pretzel fondu, which was yummy!  Our dinners arrived before we finished the fondu, which would normally bug me, but it saved me from getting full from the appetizer.  I had the turkey pastrami sandwich and thought it was delicious.  Liked it enough that I would definitely order again next time I visit!  Please tell Mr. Sam Fox to opena a culinary dropout in Denver!"}
{"text":"Great place enjoy a Friday night. Very much liked it! A friend found this place and we decided to try it. We both had a great time and service was phenomenal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing. I went there last night and sat at the bar with two other people. The service started out fine, but by the end of the night the bartenders and servers were more concerned with closing down then helping us out even though it was only 9:30 or so.  We had to 25 minutes in between getting our drinks until some random guy walked past and we grabbed his attention to order food. He wasn't our original bartender/server. The pretzels and fondue are the best thing there hands down. Everything else we had was just all right. When our food came the food runners didn't ask if we needed anything else. We had to wander around to other tables to get silverware because we couldn't get any servers attention. I've been there one other time and the antipasto platter is tasty also. The drinks were anything special. 

Overall 

Atmosphere/location- 5 stars 

Food- 3 stars 

Drinks- 2 stars 

Service- 0 stars"}
{"text":"I've been to Culinary Dropout a few times and always loved it,  but today they knocked it right out of the park.  We went for a work holiday lunch,  about 85 people.  They could not have been more accommodating, and everything worked like a well oiled machine.  We brought gifts for everyone, the valet people helped unload.  The bar - restaurant people helped take empty boxes from our section after we unpacked everything, and were super attentive.  The food was on point as always.  Even with a pretty big group,  our waiter remembered the kind of beer I'd ordered. We all had a great time!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Pastrami turkey was so flavorful as you could expect from a turkey. Salad well done and tasty. Pretzel fondue was good like people say. The only thing i would not order again were the beets. Service was good.  Would probably go back."}
{"text":"Been here half a dozen times -- most definitely my fave happy hour/casual dining/chill spot in the Valley, really.  Spectacular, unusual atmosphere (stylish, festive AND relaxed, not always an easy combination to pull off), great twists on pub food classic (LOVE my honey fried chicken here, and the appetizer plates are always the best quality), and outstanding, creative cocktail selection.  Gorgeous eye candy staff as well, for both genders, and eye candy that is as smart, witty,  accomodating and personable as they come, too!  They make all age groups feel young and involved -- I bring my aging parents here occasionally, and they always perk up when surrounded by the kind of warm and dynamic environment CD provides.  Love this place, might just be the most overall successful Fox Restaurant here."}
{"text":"I was there alone on Sunday 12/14/14 for dinner before a show and dressed very nicely.  The hostess seated me next to the kitchen But the waiter never came over to offer a drink or take my order.  I tried to get his attention, he looked at me several times but -- nothing.  He had a large party that had people joining randomly and so I wanted to give the guy the benefit of the doubt.  However, 10 minutes later, a couple was seated.  The waiter was there within a couple of minutes and took a drink order.  I tried to get his attention again -- nothing.   I also tried to get the attention of a man in a Chef's outfit who was oblivious to my attempts.  I decided to wait just a bit longer and see what would happen.  He brought their drinks and took their dinner order and I still couldn't get his attention.  I also tried to get the attention of a man in a Chef's outfit who was oblivious to my attempts.  So I walked out and let the receptionist know who didn't seem concerned.  Even if someone is waiting on another person even a bad waiter knows to get the person a drink.  So I went to the Pink Taco (in the complex) and the Waiter and Bartender were SO nice.  I was served in record time and the food was really good."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to in terms of service.  Hard Rock in general have the worst servers and staff.  Was kept waiting for over 30 minutes to get a server to take our order and no one came."}
{"text":"WIsh I could give the place 3.5 stars. Does not deserve 3 stars, but cannot go to 4 stars.
Good food
Service was good, friendly, informative. 
It is not that I did not like the decor, just thought they did not do enough with it. The Purple textured wall and the kitchen window needs to be lit much better, either from top or bottom. to show the detail of the panels.
The rock photos are the typical black and whites that I have seen at any of a dozen places in LA over the past 15 years. Mick Jagger, Janis, Keith RIchards, yawn. If your going to use those photos on that big of a wall, at least make a bigger impact and blow them up much larger. Fox has an army of designers and management, to me they got a bit lazy with the decor. 
The menu design and fonts, I have seen in quite a few places. It works very well, but come up with something original guys, Check out Red Devil Pizza on Hollywood Blvd to see what I mean. I think thats the name of the place. Anyway, I can tell you that most likely the Fox Group has been to the place. Very similar. 
I would go back, but I would not run back, or go out of my way. I would say that the place will be successful because it has enough to offer, and it is a killer location. Of course that Scottsdale crowd can be very fickle."}
{"text":"So I started off at the bar and Blake and Matt were the bartenders and they were super attentive and awesome all of their suggestions were spot on. And then
We got a table and this dude that looked like he was straight out of a zz top video was our server and he freaking amazing knew his stuff to a tee and his recommendations were awesome and honestly between the bartenders Blake and Matt and our server Corey service was ON POINT!!!"}
{"text":"FOX CONCEPTS you always having it going on!  The atmosphere at any FOX restaurant we have dined at always pleases the entire family!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, best food that we had while here on vacation (we also ate at Element at Sanctuary, too), and our service was amazing!  Thanks, Arrie for making our experience so enjoyable!

We also loved the house band. Great sound and set list!"}
{"text":"Trendy, hip, good looking staff, nice outdoor seating option, clean.  Great place to grab a bite with colleagues.  Great people watching and the food is really enjoyable.  Definitely get the pretzels and fondue and the dessert with Carmel popcorn is another must have.  Fox restaurants are consistently very good.  Pricing is ok and not obnoxiously expensive especially for being located at Scottsdale fashion square mall."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is getting any stars at all is because the food is legit. Sadly, the horrible service out shined the very decent menu. Our server, Wendy, was the opposite of friendly. We dined on a Saturday for lunch and our party was in a fabulous mood when we sat down! 80 degree weather, a fun atmosphere and great drinks on tap...perfect. Sadly, our experience didn't play out that way at all. After sitting down at our table we waited 15 minutes to be greeted. We ordered drinks and waited another 10 minutes minimum. At this point we still didn't even have so much as waters for our parched party. Never were we approached with a smile or apology and that would have gone a long way. We ordered our food (traveling with 4 small children) and that took an hour from when we placed it. It was going from bad to worse.  During all of this nonsense our server was nowhere to be found! No check in at all! Finally the food arrives and she isn't even the one to deliver it. That's neither here nor there but she also never stopped back to see how we were doing. In fact, our children were getting to full meltdown mode at this point and when i finally saw her I asked for the check. I was again met with an annoyed stare. I can only hope that some outside circumstance was controlling her mood. I can't help but think that if you are in the service industry and your restaurant is backed up, a sure fired way to keep the customer happy is with a friendly attitude or a touch of sincerity/accountability. Note to future customers: have patience and low expectation, order the pretzel appetizer and request to be seated with a congenial person who is willing to make your day better and not worse."}
{"text":"The food was decent, i enjoyed the jambalaya and my husband the fish n chips. And the beer selection was okay as well. The waitstaff definitely acted too cool for school, though. Really, what do you expect when you hire a bunch of hipsters to attempt customer service?"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here.  Cozy and chic.  I had the Spring Vegetable salad on my first (and only so far) visit and loved it.  Great visit overall.  Food is a tad pricey, which is expected with location."}
{"text":"A group of us from work recently tried out Culinary Dropout for lunch.  I had only been in the past for bevies, so was excited to try the food.  It was ok.  We took our Chef from the hotel also, and he commented the same.  DO:  order the pretzel bites appetizer with the cheese fondue - awesome.  The menu does cover all of the bases as far as having the burger, sandwiches, salads, some pasta dished.  I ordered the french dip, and it was good, not a whole ton of meat inside the big, big, bun.  My co-worker had a burger and it looked really good, and was quite large also, she took home half.  Our chef ordered the pastrimi on pretzel bread and said it was quite tasty, and another co-worker had their version of the cuban sandwich.  Again, everything was good, not blow me away, but good.  However, I do love the decor, and they have this huge beautiful big chandelier hanging.  The chairs and seating areas are all kind of mismatched and funky, but it works.  I love the patio and will definately check it out when it isn't 300 degrees outside in July.  The wait staff is not dissapointing either...Scottsdale's finest pretty people that can serve too."}
{"text":"Food was very good and the wait staff remained friendly and kept smiling all while serving 22 people for a 40th birthday party.  Recommend the BBQ nachos. Enjoyed the live music."}
{"text":"I've had good and ok experiences in This restaurant. The kale salad is one of the best salads I've had though."}
{"text":"Loved it. Atmosphere. Fun. Great service. Terrific menu. Loved it  terrific beer selection"}
{"text":"We loved this place. Very trendy, and huge! They played great music and the food was fantastic. Our server Schuyler was the best! She had great recommendations for food and drinks, and was very attentive!!"}
{"text":"Its a combination of The Yard and Culinary. Best place for team happy hours. They have 3 ping pong tables. Great Beers and food. I loved their Deschutes \" Fresh Squeezed Ipa\", Oregon."}
{"text":"I had a French dip sandwich, which I have to say, was the most tender \"roast beef\" sandwich I've ever had.  Unfortunately, it was so loud with the live band playing that I could not hear my companions, and felt a bit ripped off that I had such good food but wanted to get out so fast."}
{"text":"I ordered the ribs, which were featured on their menu as one of their specialties.  They were undercooked to the point where I wasn't sure I should keep eating them.  Don't think about 'fall off the bone' ribs - think about 'gnawing on a piece of raw meat' ribs.  So why did I give this place 4 stars?  The 7 other people in my party all had food that was awesome, and their pretzels and provolone appetizer is worth it.

They seem to hire only attractive, blonde waitresses, which I'm not going to complain about, especially since everyone was very helpful and friendly.  Our waitress helped us choose drinks, food items, and skillfully shot down the table next to us when they tried to hit on her.  Service was prompt, and my glass was always full.

As I said, my ribs were bad.  Really bad.  But again, balance that against the pretzel and provolone appetizer, and amazingly, it was a pretty good meal.  My girlfriend had a sandwich, which was incredible, and the rest of the table really enjoyed their meals.

The atmosphere is fun, although not overly exotic.  They have some large, comfortable booths, great for kicking back in, and they have a lot of outdoor seating with misters to keep things cool.  I'll definitely go back, but I'll order something a little less risky next time."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink.  Great music:  Nirvana?  Radiohead?!  That is amazingly awesome.  I ate the Butternut Squash Cannelloni.  It was pretty tasty, but they could have given me actual chunks of brussel sprouts instead of shavings.  My bf got the fish and chips.  I was disappointed with the chips part of it--too thin.  

The cheap white cloth napkins kept shedding little white bits all over our clothes.  Too weird.  

Warning--this is not the place to have a romantic date, deep conversation, or even a relaxing meal; the music was quite loud, plus we were seated right next to the kitchen and continually heard orders being shouted.  There was also a shrieking baby that was way worse than all the other noises combined, but I imagine this occurrence is rare on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good, but the seating was not really comfortable, too low for the table and awkward mismatch of table and chairs makes conversation difficult. Recommend you go and have a beer and the pretzel and cheese appetizer; it is very, very good. Don't stay for dinner. We tried the devilled eggs; three halves for $5. Not bad, but an overwhelming smoke flavor. Also tried the chicken meatballs, which were deadly dry. The sweet potato cannoli was inedible, and the Cajun chicken was so salty none of us could eat it. The salmon was okay, and the fries are good. We went late and they were out of many of the entrees. We've eaten at a lot of restaurants in Scottsdale, and this is probably the worst; over-priced and over-salted food."}
{"text":"Moscow mules are the best here! The ambiance is cute. They have a patio which is awesome. Great place for birthday dinners and dates!"}
{"text":"Went before the fireworks and it wasn't crowded. The staff really tried to persuade us to sit outside. We had a quirky waiter. Never did bring sweetener for my tea. My date ordered a side salad that came out right away. Then my salad eventually came out & it tasted good.  He ordered a chicken sandwich that must have taken over 30 minutes or longer so we never ate dinner at the same time. Very weird. The GM came to our table since he realized it took so long. Told us dinner was on the house. Then the quirky waiter came back and charged us for my tea that I never got the sweetener for & the salad. I don't plan to return after this first experience. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Fun place, love the outdoor bean bag toss options.

The food, no bueno however."}
{"text":"Well we just happened to stumble onto this restaurant the other night because we thought the name was funny.... It was one of the best stumbles EVER!
The antipasti selection was wonderful and almost everything we ordered was mouth watering delightful! The only \"meh\" item was the \"spreadable chorizo\" we were expecting something....well...spreadable, instead it was just a slice of chorizo cut in half. But other then that everything was great and I Highly recommend the deviled eggs!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the best place to eat before doing some shopping on Mill Avenue.  It's a little off of Mill, but worth it.  Fun, open, historic atmosphere.  The food was reasonable and plentiful.  Service was excellent.  Happy Hour is a good time to hang out and enjoy friends without being rushed."}
{"text":"Place was great. I loved the ambiance, warm and inviting with enough room for privacy. The food was really goodand served quickly, although I do wish everything was a bit warmer when served... prices are average of the Waterfront,as well as the portions, and our server (Johnny I believe...) made great suggestions and was extremely friendly. Try the Turkey Pastrami on a pretzel bun, pretty delicious. Ill be back:)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Service was great, food was good. The yard reminded me of all the fun times at my grandparents. All the vintage decor brought back many childhood memories. We will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! Went on a Saturday... The live music was a tad loud for my taste but I had a good time here with friends. Hands down, get the pretzels with cheese fondue. Delicious appetizer!!! I got the bbq bacon burger. I've had many bbq bacon burgers in my time and this surpassed them all. It was massive! And where a regular burger has a piece or two of bacon, this was stacked! Very flavorful. My only complaint is I got my water refilled once the whole time I was there... I had to steal my hubby's water. Otherwise would have had 5 stars! I'll definitely come back sometime."}
{"text":"Waw. I have given this establishment 3 chances and now I am ready to describe my feelings. The title is very descriptive of the experience because it feels like it's ran by a drop out. After waiting about an hour for a table, prepare for at least a 2 hour overpriced meal. The food is artesian inspired but is more basic tasting than an Instagram selfie with no filter. I'm surprised I even got my food after waiting 45+ minutes every time I've had the displeasure of dining here. My drink (the only good thing) was constantly empty and I never received an extra side of ketchup after 3 attempts. I'm convinced Chingy receives better service than this \"chillin' at the Holiday Inn\" ... Their \"scratch kitchen\" also ran out of tortilla chips AND meatloaf... UNFORGIVABLE. 

If you're a basic wanna be hipster and have a lot of extra free time to overpay for mediocre \"artisan\" food that they probably ran out of... Feel free to come on by."}
{"text":"I'm a local almost never eat at hotels but I was at the pool at Hard Rock last week and my friends and I were very hungry, the Dropout hit the spot, our server Dominique was very friendly and made some suggestions, great burgers and P.B.R... We all went back to the pool very content..."}
{"text":"Ani was such a great hostess. She was very personable and made my experience glorious. Will definitely come back every time I'm in town just because of the impact that Ani's service left on me!"}
{"text":"Worst service!! Sat at the bar, order a drink never got it. The other bartender had to ask me if I needed one. My food came out to-go?!?! It was a joke. I will never go back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Pretzel bites and fondue are AMAZING. There's so much on the menu, and everything with a twist to elevate it. Fresh and clever cocktails, too! We enjoyed some antipasti (although we passed on the fresh charcuterie, I could see them slicing the meats from my table!). And I liked my grilled cheese sliders. My friend really enjoyed the grilled chicken sandwich and the waitress recommended a pretzel bun, which really pulled the whole sandwich together!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant group to begin with, you usually can't go wrong with any of the 'Fox Restaurant Concept' restaurant. Well deserved James Beard nomination

This place has such a great vibe. Came here on a Saturday for an early dinner. Walked in and there was a 20 min break so we went to the bar to have some drinks. The bartenders are amazing here, they really  know their stuff. I ordered a drink off the menu, can't remember what it was called. But it was tasty. My friend asked the bartender to make him anything. It was great! Whatever it was.

Overall great. We did the cheese/charcuterie board,  then split the bistro steak, no dessert.  Great solid meal. Love the way you can mix and match the cheese/meat plate. The meat was perfectly cooked medium rare and well seasoned. 


I'm definitely making this place one of my go-to's"}
{"text":"In my mind, my dad is the best cook ever.  We will go out to eat and I will say, \"You know where I've had a better version of this, when my dad made it.\"
Color me impressed when someone can compare - I would have though my dad was in the back making the food brought out.

We started with the pretzel fondue, cheese - good, pretzel rolls - good! It was a lot of bread for the 2 of us, it could be ordered for a larger group.  But tasty!
My husband ordered the Pub Burger and I had the turkey pastrami, both came out fast and delicious.

We came on a Saturday for lunch and there was no wait for a table."}
{"text":"Burger was best ever! Up selling not so nice!
Good vibe, attentive servers. When I brought up the up charge the server gracefully took it off the bill. Would go back for the food, would closely monitor my bill."}
{"text":"I've been a few times to this location, 3 to be exact. All were okay except this last one. I went on a Friday night (it is beyond busy on weekend nights by the way) and I sat outside with a group of about 8 at one of the fire pits. When we were to order, the waitress took each of our cards to start a tab. I've never been anywhere before where they do this, but it's not something I'm comfortable with to say the least. After about 2 hours of hanging out and conversing, we all paid our tabs and left. I woke this morning to get breakfast with my mom and noticed I didn't have my card. I immediately called the location and they took my information down and told me they would call when they had a manager in. An hour and a half passed and I still had no call, so I went in. Once I reached the hostess stand, they grabbed me a manager immediately. Why wasn't I called when she arrived like they said? I explained the predicament and she checked all 3 places they would put it, found nothing, then called the waitress. The waitress claimed she gave it to another one of the girls in my party. When I called all of my friends, none of them had it. The manager also brought up the fact that I hadn't asked for my card back that night. I'm sorry, but what other restaurant do you go to where you have to ask for your debit card back from the waitress? I had clearly forgotten she had it since it had been nearly 2 hours after she had taken it. Opening tabs is not something I'm used to, I hadn't noticed. Her remark angered me, obviously. So now I've gone through the process of cancelling my card, requesting a new one, and a painful truth pulling experience all for the price of a mediocre pretzel fondu."}
{"text":"Very diverse menu. Great wine list. Great service. Fun people watching. The 36 hour ribs were great!  Really enjoyed our meal here."}
{"text":"First time at CD this past Saturday. The noise level was ridiculously loud, Came to hear the live music, which was great, but hardly anyone was listening. Food was ok - nothing special. Fish and chips were ok but the fish was a little greasy. Tried the antipasti and paid far too much for what was served. Customer service was fine. The menu could have used more descriptions about the brews and the food. Surprised the crowd is so young given the prices. Won't rush back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is HUGE!!!!!!!! Great for Birthdays even when its crazy busy the staffs very calm and relaxed which makes u feel good! The prices are kinda pricy but its worth going! Plus parking is perfect!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and very cool atmosphere!  Recommend the pretzel fondue...enough to share...very yummy. Wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable of the menu and was so right on about all our picks! Had the meatloaf and was floored...just delicious...best I have ever had at a restaurant. Friends had the fried chicken and cleaned their plates...can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I visited again last Saturday afternoon. The staff was very friendly, and the atmosphere was fun. We noticed that they seem to be drawing in a younger crowd than before. Still, this seems to be a place that attracts all demographics--families with children, groups of people looking for more of a lively \"bar\" atmosphere, and folks planning for an afternoon of relaxation with cocktails or a bottle of wine--and somehow, it works. I like it.
Anyway, it won't be a frequent stop, but it's part of the rotation. :-)"}
{"text":"The outside seating is fantastic. It's a huge place that's really open and comfortable. The food was really good, but a little bit pricey for the Mill area. Their beer, wine, and specialty drinks have a ton of options. Particularly the specialty drinks had a lot of different things to try. It's a really great place to start a night on the town or to bring the family since they have games like ping pong, fooseball, and cornhole."}
{"text":"After receiving a Fox gift card from a co-worker my guy and I decided on Culinary Dropout to go use it at. The atmosphere was fun, hip and cool with a warm evening to round it out with outdoor seating. We had already checked out the the menu before heading over so we already had an idea of what we wanted. To start I got the brown bag beer just cause it sounded cool and the soft pretzels and cheese which were amazing!! I also got the grilled chicken club and the \"cheap house salad\" yes that is the real name. My guy got the chicken curry. We were both pleased with the food it was good portions with good flavor but it was nothing that really wowed us. For it being a week day evening the place was about 2/3 with no wait for a table however our only negative comment during the meal was that it seemed to take the waitress quite some time to come back to us  to check in and offer the check. All in all it was a good meal and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just tried this for the first time. is now one of my new favorites. The atmosphere is fun, the service was great, the food was delicious ,drinks amazing-everything was great! Try the pretzel bread and cheese appetizers, wow!!!!"}
{"text":"Only sat at the bar, but got great device and nice menus for beverages and food.  Great ambience and well designed.  Will definitely try for a full meal in the future."}
{"text":"2013 Spring Restaurant Week Review:

While walking through Hard Rock I saw a sign stating \"Patio Open.\"  So, I put on my leg brakes and walked straight on in.

The restaurant is huge and looks like Restoration Hardware threw up all over it.  The servers all look like they were bussed in from Williamsburg.  But, my only focus was the outdoor seating.

It's glorious, by the way. Comfy banquettes, outdoor bar, poolside, and firepits. Fire!

Oh, anyways, the food. 

I chose the carrot-ginger soup, fried chicken, and chocolate tart options from the RW menu.   My table also went for the pretzel and cheese fondue appetizer.  

The pretzel fondue was really great.  The pretzels were soft and chewy and the cheese was delicious, although a little clumpy.  I do wish they served the cheese a little hotter.  Overall, a great appetizer.

My first course, the carrot-ginger soup, was really flavorful.  I couldn't eat it all so I asked for a box.  Instead of boxing my leftovers, they gave me a whole new soup!  

The second course, the fried chicken, was pretty good.  There were three huge pieces and each was moist on the inside, crunchy on the outside.  Unfortunately, the chicken was bit too salty for me, but the batter definitely had a great flavor.   The dish also came with a tasty honey biscuit, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  I really enjoyed the coleslaw because it wasn't caked in dressing. 

My favorite part of the meal was probably the toffee chocolate tart.  I've been on a tart kick lately and this one was the best of the batch.  The chocolate was dark and rich but not too sweet.  A great way to end the meal.

Our server, Thanon (sp? Sorry!), was the nicest server I've had in a long time.  He went out of his way to make our meal amazing. He even offered to box up my leftover Sazerac! Who does that?!?! I would go back just for the service, it was that good.

The food, overall, is probably a 3 star experience, but the service and ambiance deserve extra stars.  I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight. Music was way too load but that's probably because they had a live band and the place is huge! The live band was amazing and they preformed beautifully. Service was okay...the poor waitress was running around busy with people to attend to since this place is massive huge. Anyway my sister and I ordered the blackened mussels and they where great! It was a lot of mussels for a great price. Flavor was great! The lady next to me ordered a Cesar salad. Honestly it looked like just lettuce and cheese on top. It was pretty sad for their impression of a Cesar salad. She told the waitress that she wasn't pleased with it. Moments later a nice man came and said if he could get her anything else. She didn't get anything else but he was really nice and apologetic about the situation. I was very impressed by that. Over all I would come back again but not at 8pm on a Saturday night. Decent food and really friendly employees."}
{"text":"Great service and fun environment. Mikaela took great care of me at the bar. She helped recommend appetizers and makes drinks quicker than the rest. I'll sit in her section the next time I'm there"}
{"text":"Interesting food in a hipster setting. 
If you're looking for typical bar food, you won't go wrong. 
However: Before you order that burger, ask the attentive waitstaff for the chefs or their suggestions.
The pirogues were excellent. So was their version of French Dip. The meat was tender."}
{"text":"Terribly over priced for what you get! Pretzels with fondue tasted like salty rocks dipped in salty cheese honestly I can see how they are drop outs lol. Rude staff as well only come here if you want to have terrible service and pay too much for bad food"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service, meals came out  quick, beautiful environment. New favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place. It has a good, hipster type, atmosphere. They have really good food and the drinks were delicious. Our service was also great..I will return!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, and an awesome atmosphere!  This place is a must for anyone visiting and looking for a good place to socialize, eat, and drink."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed that I actually set up a yelp account for the purpose of reviewing this place. I've been here a couple of times. The first time, it was so loud that I couldn't hear my dinner mates. Moreover, I ordered a salad with chicken and the chicken came out pink. Not sort-of pink. Really-not-yet-cooked-pink. 

Figuring I'd give it another try, I ordered the salmon dish on a different occasion and it was actually really good. Pleasant surprise. This was from the Scottsdale location, which was also so loud you couldn't hear each other despite sitting next to one another. 

Today, wanting some good protein and veggies, my girlfriend and I ordered takeout from the culinary dropout at the yard. Each salmon entree was $22.00. And the container held a piece of salmon, approximately eight thimble-sized parsnip pieces, four tracing-paper-thin apple slices and four Brussels sprouts halves. For $22.00. And I'm the first person to spend money of good food, so am used to large restaurant bills. This, however, in presentation and substance, was pathetic. We actually called the manager to let the restaurant know about the poor take out orders, and he was apathetic, at best. I will not be back to this restaurant, especially given all of the quality food  available in the valley."}
{"text":"Pros the pretzel fondue is ok. Cons the service is atrocious. One would think they automatically add tip but not. They just stink. 
  Actually the closest I can come up with is this is a resturant version of Abercrombie. 
The food is adequate but noting special."}
{"text":"Eat at the bar!! Best service and experience.  Casey and Corey are amazing!  My boyfriend and i come here only to eat at the bar and drink their creative 'off the menu' cocktails."}
{"text":"The vibe, decor, games, etc.... is why i come here. I've come with the fam and with business colleagues for lunch.  We always have a blast.  The food, well the food could use some work. It's not bad, but for there are so many other choices that are much better."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderfully prepared good.  I definitely recommend eating here.  We came 3 times during our stay.  Deviled eggs are really good.  Soup is homemade worthy!  My husband feel in love with the breadsticks.  Salads are fresh and fulling.  Burgers are huge.  Most people I saw could only eat half.  Burgers were made with pretzel buns."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place only has 3 1/2 stars. I love it here. I've tried the pretzels and cheese(heavenly), 36 hour ribs(delicious), pork belly nachos(surprisingly yummy), and the monkey bread(the only thing I did not care for). The menu is very simple but the food is so good and I love the atmosphere. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a restaurant with a cool vibe and great food."}
{"text":"cool warehouse atmosphere, decent beer selection.   Nice informal place to hang out w/ the bar and game area

Like everyone is saying, the pretzel rolls w/ the fondue is a solid app to order.    I tried the trout w/ asparagus and almonds for main course and loved it.    Will be back to try some more"}
{"text":"They have this crazy policy of waiting 10 minutes after paging someone on the waitlist. As a result it is maddening to see empty tables sit there for 30 minutes or more while the hostesses page and wait for parties to respond (mostly not respond) 10 minutes at a time.  

I feel sorry for the wait staff as they probably lose out on a lot of business as a result. And ultimately whoever manages the restaurant should take a look again at this silly policy because I can't imagine empty tables on a Saturday night being good business."}
{"text":"Happy hour was great. Ended up in the middle of a shift change and never got helped after cashing out, which was the only negative. Drinks and food were all really good."}
{"text":"Very very busy place. Inside and outside can be loud however its a lively place. Lots of nice simple games outside so you can enjoy the evening. We had Thai wings for app (delicious) Some of the cheese/meat/veg/bread suggestions (garlic something or other goat cheese!!!) and an entree, it was the ribeye steak with delicious veggies. We actually had dessert. It was a caramel vanilla custard which sounds a little ordinary but was absolutely amazing in addition to the chocolate stuff...yummy! 
I have been there few times now and had a good experience thus far except for one incident with the waiter. They should have more patience and listen to what the order is. This didn't stop me from going back there."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I absolutely loved it! Food was delicious and staff was very friendly. Very clean and comfortable. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I visited this location for the first time recently and will definitely be back! We had Sara as our bartender and she was so helpful and friendly. The food (especially the pretzels and cheese fondue), as well as our drinks, were amazing! Will definitely be back next time I am on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Wife and kids; kids played table tennis in the yard and we relaxed and enjoyed the great beer selection. Food and service excellent. Cannot wait to returns sans kids and have some fun with friends..... Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very attentive and knowledgable bar tenders. Gave us phenomenal descriptions of their dishes. Very cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great good and what a great ambiance! The price is just right too. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The service was extraordinary and the food was amazing !! I ordered the pretzel fondue which was to die for. The cheese was unbelievable flavorful and creamy and the pretzels were melting in my mouth. I ordered the turkey pastrami which was pure goodness. The pretzel bread was so so soft biting into the sandwhich. There was also Atleast 50 grams of protein in the sandwhich itself, it was filled with turkey. The sauce used in this hunk of sustenance was to die for. I would recommend it to the protein lovers. All those who pick up weights :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food is great at this location. Ashley (short brown/blonde hair) made the experience even better by being an amazing server. She was extremely attentive to our tables needs and was quick to get us anything we asked for. I would return here just to have her as a server again because her service was excellent."}
{"text":"Such a great place to hang out for happy hour. My friends and I lived the laid back atmosphere and the happy hour menu was perfect! The pretzel bites with the cheese were amazing."}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices. Good looking wait staff. Hostess was really nice and really cute. Service is fantastic. I come back yes."}
{"text":"I found a piece of glass in my antipasto plate tonight.  I crunched down on an almond mix and spit out glass in my napkin.   I brought it to the attention of the waiter and he apologized up and down, but it wasn't until we paid that the manager made her way to our table to hand us her business card.  She told us next time she would comp an appetizer.  

First time there and it was NOT a good experience.  Given a $6 appetizer for chewing on glass!"}
{"text":"The server had a great attitude and was helpful in explaining the antipasti and refilling our drinks.
Ordered the potato chips, cheese sliders and the Mac Burger.
Potato chips were good, onion dip was ok, didn't taste like onions.
Mac Burger is a good proximity of what that famous burger used to taste like when I was a kid and they were about the same size as this burger.
Cheese sliders were awful!  These were late coming to a table, apology was given and we were told they would be taken care of.  The cost was still on our bill.  Ultimately, the biggest issue with the sliders is that they tasted like propane gas, no cheese or toast flavor.
Would not go our of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink on Friday this weekend and was extremely pleased!
Customer service was great, Bex, was very accommodating and suggested delicious olives and nuts as aps- tried their pineapple Pisco Sour- delish :)
Due to the great experience that I had on Friday, went back for dinner on Sat. This time I tried the oysters, king crab legs and steak.  All were amazing and again the customer service provided bu Bex was outstanding again.
No doubt I'll stop in there next time I'm in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  The atmosphere was very fun.  Our waitress was funky and gave us attention that wasn't overbearing or non existent (right in between).  If you are in the area, try it out.  The mussels were delicious and a good appetizer to share with at least three or more people."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe, great food (gotta get the pretzel balls and cheese). 

This is a cool place for a working meeting during the day, a first date, or a happy hour with friends. Nice, but not stilted. Like all sam fox restaurants, you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale for a weekend and stumbled on this place on Yelp. It has a fun atmosphere and cool live music. When I went, it was a reggae band. They have TVs all around so if you want to watch a game I imagine it's a good place for that. The best part... They have the most AMAZING pretzel balls! They're perfectly baked. They come out piping hot (actually you should probably take it slow at first). They have a slightly crunchy outside and soft middle. They have just the right amount of salt. It comes with some sort of fondue as well. I ended up asking for yellow mustard and thought it was divine. I would come back here just for this!! I also ordered the ahi tuna salad and my friend got a strawberry kale salad. We probably would have been more than fine splitting just one of them. The salads are very healthy portions. Overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"Second time at this location. I made a reservation for two on Friday night. As soon as we arrived and checked in with the hostess they walked us to our table. Even with a reservation, that's extremely rare. The customer service was great. I ordered a ramen dish that was okay, but wouldn't recommend. He ordered the ribs, which are now in my top fave dishes - definitely recommend! For dessert we shared the bourbon black bottom pie (that might not be the exact name) and it was DE-LICIOUS. I would come here again just for this dessert. Drink wise, we ordered the room service - didn't disappoint if you like bubbles, and pistols at dawn - a bourbon twist to a Moscow Mule that will put some hair on your chest. 
My only real complaint was that the live music is LOUD. You can't hear each other speak and carry on any conversation that lasts longer than the breaks between songs. I couldn't even hear my waitress. Not the best place for a date night, but if you're a group of friends who want to listen to some live music and not talk to each other, this might be a nice spot."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and drinks, as well as a cool cast of servers to help you on your choice of menu items. Live music on the weekends makes it a fun place to work and hangout at. I will be paying them a visit soon."}
{"text":"I went to Culinary Dropout while on vacation. The food, service and ambiance was fantastic. I only wish I lived in Scottsdale so I could return weekly!"}
{"text":"I live in Tucson and travel to Phoenix frequently we need one of these as soon as possible the concept is amazing and definitely different. We went on a Sunday and there were many drink specials and food specials. We sat outside where there was plenty of outdoor seating with couches and tables perfect for large groups of friends to relax. We were able to play different games and watch football on the TV all while participating in different drink specials. It is definitely a place that we will have to visit again and hope that they will expand to Tucson"}
{"text":"Fox made a great move putting this concept in Vegas! I had dinner on the patio with a large group and everything was a hit. 
We of course shared a few servings of the pretzel and cheese appy. Always a must have at any culinary. 
I had the fries chicken meal and was blown away with how amazing the breading was. I think it's drizzle in honey.  
Our server was very knowledgeable and made some great recommendations for my friends. 
Will be returning once I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Always a good time at Culinary Dropout. Fun food and great atmosphere. We usually get a bunch of dishes and share between friends. Pretzels with cheese are a must to start things off. The Thai Wings are always a favorite. This time we threw in an order of nachos, changed out the pork for chicken, and the list goes on. Oh yeah, the honey fried chicken is out of this world. If you're in Vegas and looking for a great place to hang out, eat and have some fun you will want to check this place out."}
{"text":"This was the final stop for me and my friend before we headed to the airport so we wanted to end our trip with good food and this place did not disappoint! Our server (I can't remember his name but he is from Spokane) was so friendly, professional and attentive. The manager Jorge just happened to be walking by as I was trying to give someone directions over the phone and he has got to be one the nicest guys we met on the trip. Customer service at this place was top notch! They not only talked to us about the menu, but engaged us in other conversation...nothing deep, but they made us feel like welcomed guests and not just \"party of 2 at table 19\". Our server and Jorge gave us great recommendations and I ended up with the fried chicken which was well flavored and just the right amount of crispy and very juicy and tender. My friend had a the ribs and the were falling off the bone. Both were SO good! We also started out with the homemade chips and Onion dip and anti-pasta. Also very good. The environment was so welcoming and exciting. So much going on, yet not too crazy where you feel like you can't be in your moment. So glad we stopped here because not only was the food yummy but the service was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. I was in town for a conference and wanted food that I cannot get at home. Culinary Dropout did not disappoint. My friend and I shared an antipasti platter with prosciutto, cheese and bread. The bread was amazing - their balsamic is delicious. She had a bacon Bloody Mary and I had the Between You and Me. Both were fabulous! For dinner she had the Thai Chili Chicken wings and I had the fish and chips. Again, everything was fabulous. I've had good fish and chips in London, and London's best doesn't even compare. Wow. We're only in town for 3 days, and I want to eat there everyday...that's how amazing it was. And more than just the food was amazing. The atmosphere was great, not too loud, we were able to carry on a conversation without issue. The seating was very comfortable and the decor is spot-on super swanky and very hip. The service was also on point. Our waiter was very friendly and took great care of us. Overall this place was fabulous. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, and to me, it's for a certain crowd. First time I was here, I sat at the bar and ordered food to go. I had the acai mojito and it was a bit strange. I am a HUGE mojito fan, but it tasted a bit cough-syrup like. I had the strawberry cocktail next, and that one tickled my fancy. I took the pork cubano to go and  it was amazing.
Went there last night and it was really great. The pretzels and fondue is to die for, so are the mussells. And, the monket bread is a MUST for dessert. Great food, fun vibe. More of a younger crowd, really adventurous cocktails, so leave gramma at home. Great decor, too. 

Oh, and the chairs are insanely comfortable. Gotta love that."}
{"text":"I really love going to Culinary Dropout for a drink. The place is so cute and it is in a great location. The patio is really nice to sit at for a drink and so is the bar. 

However, my love of Culinary Dropout ends with the ambiance and the drinks. The food is just so-so. I've tried everything here from apps to salads and nothing has been very good. All of the food is heavy and overly seasoned. 

If you just wanna grab a quick drink before heading out this is a great place, but I'd pick somewhere else for your dinner plans."}
{"text":"Overall I dug it. We were able to get seated right away.  They have a nice cocktail list and some intriguing beers. I was going in a little hungover, so I went with a bubbly cocktail which fixed me right up! We were going with regulars, so they ordered the pretzels; I recommend them. There were a couple nice veg options, so I didn't feel like I was forced into any dish. Our table got a variety of dishes from salads to meatloaf. Everyone was happy with what they got. The decor and vibe is cool- Edison bulbs aplenty with that rustic yet elegant thing going on. Our server was super knowledgable and friendly.  There is a cool yard space with games too, so brunch can easily turn into an all day drinking event. 
My only real complaint- don't force people into valet. After we got inside, I realized I left my sweater in the car, and it was such a pain to go and find it."}
{"text":"We arrived for a special celebratory meal, and the waitress made the occasion super special.  She was very attentive, and the food the appetizers (choice of small sides) to main meal (the best salmon salads we have ever had) was delicious!  

The only thing that may need attention is the outside seating was very uncomfortable from overuse, and may need some replacement."}
{"text":"I got the pleasure of having a work luncheon at Culinary Dropout and since they were trying to impress us food and service was impeccable. Got to try lots of menu items and the manager talked about each one. It was clear he (along with all the staff we interacted with) were truly passionate about the restaurant and the food (and drinks) served. He made it seem that top notch service was their top priority and they would bend over backward to please guests. Of course hearing things like this are common in these types of situations where they are hosting our luncheon. 

However, I went back there a week or so later on a (very late) Friday night and was pleased to discover my experience was just as good even when they thought I was just a \"regular\" guest. Our server, Jesse, was probably the best server I've ever had. The kitchen was already closed when we arrived but he gladly managed to whip us up some of their infamous monkey bread despite this fact. Which paired perfectly with the chocolate stout canned beer. All in all, huge kudos to culinary dropout for practicing what they preach."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. We were seated inside and asked to be moved outside if a table became available and they hooked us up with a great table out by a fire pit. The food was really good and I really loved the ambiance. We would definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of going to the Culinary Dropout to celebrate my son-in-law's birthday. Our reservation was for 6:45 on a Saturday evening. We were seated promptly. Our server and the hostess were pleasant, helpful and overall it was a great experience for the food and service. We had the signature dish of pretzels and cheese sauce and they didn't disappoint- delicious!! We didn't finish them all but they went home and were enjoyed later. My son-in-law and I ordered specialty drinks which were good but seemed a tad overpriced. My fish and chips were really tasty and the Korean beef dish was a big hit too. The reason for only 3 stars was it was incredibly difficult to have any kind of conversation in this restaurant (and they had plenty of open tables when we arrived but by the time we were leaving it was packed inside and out). They were getting ready to have a band play after we left. There would be no chance at all to speak with your  company once a band started so I'm glad we came when we did!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a quick turnaround with the Family the food was great Fried chicken hit the spot. Also tried the Porkbelly nachos must have. Good selection of craft beer and a lot of fun games to keep you entertained. Our server Richard did a great Job you need to try this place."}
{"text":"I went yesterday and was very impressed.  We had an array meets, cheese, bread, oysters and of course really good wine.  Great atmosphere!  My new favorite hang out!"}
{"text":"Nice to place to hangout.  I couldn't find much on the menu that really excited me so I got the Turkey Pastrami.  The sandwich was huge and was fine.  They have really good drinks.  I also like the live music."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great food! Even better drinks. My husband and I stopped to eat at the bar, it was delicious and not that pricey for Vegas. I recommend definitely if your at the hotel."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff was excellent and made sure our experience was unforgettable.  August made sure we had everything we needed and also was very engaging. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour. Turns out that happy hour prices only apply to those sitting at the bar. Every bar seat was taken, rest of restaurant was empty. Asked if we could sit at high tables by bar. Was told yes but would not get happy hour prices. So happy hour is limited to the first 20 people to take the seats - totally ridiculous!!  And that was at 4 pm - we left and will never return ."}
{"text":"We had a team dinner here. It was great. Food was wonderful the salads are amazing. Played ping pong, corn hole, fuse ball. Really good food and the atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"This place is a much-needed restaurant in Tempe. I'd describe it as a mixture of hip, fun, and classy, and the food reflects the atmosphere and taste of other Fox concepts.

The service was what really pushed me to write this review. Over the past couple visits, our waitress, Taylor, went out of her way to make sure that our party was absolutely happy. It was refreshing to see such great service, and we'll be sure to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to come to when I'm in town for work! I was disappointed by the service. The bartender seemed uninterested and annoyed by my presence. And, I found a hair in my food.  They comp'd the meal and were apologetic. However, this experience was not good. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Was on business trip. Went to Culinary Dropout twice with co-workers. Recommend the meatloaf, fried chicken, pretzel bites, pork belly nachos, and brussel sprouts. Can't wait to go back.    Thanks Kevin, Mike, and Steve for making our team dinner the last night of our trip special!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, drinks, food and staff! I have always heard great things about not only \"Culinary Dropout\" by \"The Yard\" as well, we didn't get to be seated in one of the lounges but it doesn't matter where you're seated, your bound to have a great time!  Oh and make sure to try the ribs, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Pro--Great atmosphere and cool vibe.  Cons--Portions were on the small side-even having to ask the server if the salad was a side or the full portion. The kids menu chicken fingers were spicy as well."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here while in Vegas. The specialty drinks are very good... I had the \"Partly Cloudy\" which was probably my favorite drink of my entire trip.  The service was outstanding and the food was all good... wife had the fried chicken, which she loved.  Our entire party shared food with each other and we all agreed all were a hit. Perhaps the only drawback for some in our party was that the Hard Rock pool is adjacent and the pounding house/trance music was an irritant.  I, myself, actually enjoyed it, though. Nothing like bouncing in your seat while drinking a good drink, eating some tasty food, and watching the pool patrons do their thing."}
{"text":"I was here with a group of my girlfriends. They were expecting us and yet when we got there we had to wait forever. Once we sat down they barely had any settings on the table. It took forever for them to come over to get our drink order and it took longer for them to get the drinks to us. The drinks were totally watered down. The food was over priced and there was nothing we had that I can't get anywhere else. After they dropped off our food they never came back. The arugula salad was average, I asked for dressing in the side and it came with dressings. The roasted beets were good, it would take five orders to fill a plate because the order was so tiny. The burger was average. The pretzels were good, nice and warm. I t was my first time here and it'll definitely be my last."}
{"text":"what a great place!!!! stopped in for lunch yesterday and had lunch at the bar.  great friendly staff!  the bar tender was very informed regarding the menu and the service was above and beyond what was expected. by far the best place in Phoenix for Lunch.  i will be heading their this weekend for dinner!"}
{"text":"Very impressed... With themselves that is. It seems their \"style\" is to ignore you and if you like that sort of thing... By all means go. Food is adequate the wait staff is busy texting or something other than food service...lots better places all within footsteps."}
{"text":"Spend your money here instead of waiting in line at the buffet.  The food is on point.  Everything was quality.  Something I would expect in a NYC restaurant.  Although I have to admit the average tourist will appreciate the buffet more than this place."}
{"text":"Came here on one of the pre-opening nights and the food was fabulous with great service.  Fun vibe, high energy and a great addition to Tempe. Started with antipasti; then we had the rainbow trout and Korean style ribeye cap. Very limited availability so ask for it asap.  Dessert was the bourbon black bottom pie. Yum, yum! We enjoyed plenty of wine and scotch drinks."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout just opened last week and was already written up in the Arizona Republic so we decided to try it with another couple.  After reading the reviews, I had a Brazilianaire which was really nice and light, not too sweet (so I had a 2nd one!).  Very big selection of beers.  We had three appetizers:  chips and dip (homemade chips - delicious), mussels, and the soft pretzel fondue.  We had to order more pretzels for the fondue as we still had lots of cheese left over.   For dinner, we had turkey pastrami sandwich, Cuban sandwich, fried chicken, and seared tuna salad.  Everything was delicious!  The seared tuna salad was a chopped salad with the tuna slices in it.  The portions aren't huge, but certainly enough to feed each of us.  Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"When this Sam Foxer first opened, it was DA BOMB!  Trendy and so in fashion. Even the servers were hip and artsy looking.  The food was innovative and fun.....
 
however, as time passes and money is made, the food quality starts to fade....so sad.    
 
the meat and cheese dishes are standard fare.
the pretzels are a hit or miss;  some days fresh and doughy, other days shriveled cold and left-overed-reheated tasting.  The Easy Cheese Whiz fondue is still fun to share with a big drunken group there to people watch on the outdoor patio.  

The pasta dish with rib meat is standard.  Could be a little fresher and hotter. 
The fried chicken, which used to be large cripsy juicy pieces are now sad shriveled dry  pieces.  
The highly anticipated dessert with the Caramel popcorn was so congealed and stuck together that I think I cracked a filling....Again, so sad..... 
 
There's a reason the restaurant is no longer packed to the brim as it used to a few years ago;   it has the same sad vibe as the Pink Taco when it was nearing it's decline.   
 
if you like to party with the ladies looking for their next ATMan card, this is a decent place to go on the weekends.  
 
I'm going to ask my gay couple friends where's the next trendiest place to eat would be;  they know style and food."}
{"text":"I don't get all the rave reviews of this place. I've been to this location and to the Culinary Dropout at The Yard in Tempe. I had the same experience at both places - unfriendly staff, slow kitchen and mediocre food."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Culinary Dropout for a while and it did not disappoint. Ben (our server) had some great suggestions and explained the menu very well. The food was good too but there is so much more I want to try. For my drink I got the \"After School Special\" it was good but very strong. 5 STARS for the atmosphere. Indoor and outdoor seating and live music makes this place really special. I loved it! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was expecting something more based on other friends opinions. The food was just okay, nothing super special to me. The waiter described the food like it was so unique and savory but when I tasted it, it left me wanting more. Other than that, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was fun and easy."}
{"text":"Two words: Acai mojito.  I am usually a beer drinker (which they have a good selection of, including San Tan products), but on a hot day nothing beats a mojito and the Acai mojito at Culinary Dropout was top notch, I had two.  There were many other unique cocktails on the menu, such as the bacon infused bloody mary, that I am dying to return to try.  The menu is inbetween bar and restaraunt type selections.  I had the shaved rib sandwhich with french onion soup for dipping.  It was excellent.  The decor in culinary dropout is posch with dark purple walls and large chandeliers, which is complimented by their tattooed and mo-hawked staff.  A nice place to hang out with friends or on a date."}
{"text":"Tasty, trendy, and a decent price. I do think that the ambiance and beautiful people could make the food somehow taste a little better than it really is but I could be wrong. We ate the pretzels and I tried the french onion soup. That soup was NOT good at all. It was sweet and had the weirdest aftertaste. I don't know what they did to it but it was not what I was expecting. I don't know about you but when I order a french onion soup, I expect salty, beef brothy, oniony, cheesy, and hot. Not sweet..and weird. I do have to say, the server could tell I was trying to eat it, and took it off the tab! Very nice. Half of the table ordered the meatloaf. Random thing to want to order, but it was absolutely delicious. I scarfed the entire plate and was ready to lick it."}
{"text":"I've been in a few times for food and drinks.  The atmosphere is lively and the food is a solid 4/5.  Just be aware that it can get loud during peak hours."}
{"text":"I live walking distance from the Yard and I must admit I've been there almost every week since moving in and that was a half a year ago! They never disappoint. The service is exceptional! Plus they have live music, games, even a photo booth! I highly recommend this location. You will not be disappointed, plus you can catch dinner there before heading to your night on Mill Ave!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool, extremely trendy place to eat and have drinks. We made reservations and only had to wait a few minutes for a table. Once seated we ordered drinks. Their mixed drinks are all very creative. I ordered a drink with muddled jalapeño, tequila and pineapple... it was delicious! My husband and I shared the pretzel bites with fondue to start. It is a giant portion but the pretzel is fresh and delicious, definitely the star of the show. We decided to split dinner after the massive amount of pretzel bites. We took the recommendation of the waitress and split the fried chicken and honey biscuit. When it came out the portion was still large split. The chicken was crispy with great flavor and was served with a biscuit, coleslaw and mashed potatoes. Everything was wonderful. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The decor was fun, but the background music was really odd. The music was too loud to have an easy conversation over.

The food and drink looked really fun from the menu, and were good, but not good enough to rave about.

I may go back, but there are a lot of other places I would try before then.

--Find a different mix of music please! And turn it down, I'm only 24, don't make me complain like an old grouch! --"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice within the last month. The first time was on a Wednesday during happy hour, and we had great customer service, our server was very attentive and helpful. We ordered the hummus as an appetizer and it was great! I also ordered the sangria, my server let me sample both the red and white and both were good! The second time I went in with a group of friends on a Saturday night. It was pretty busy and we didn't see a hostess so naturally we sat our selves. After waiting a while without service, I had to go to the bartender to get a server for us. Aside from that little hiccup, everything was great and service was good. I tried the blueberry beer and it was AMAZING! Also the pretzel bites are the best pretzels I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Was in AZ for Spring Training. Went to a few places that were supposed to be good, but were disappointing. Culinary Dropout did not disappoint. Great food, great drinks, awesome vibe, and amazing service!!"}
{"text":"Fun location for a drink (or two) to toast a wonderful Arizona trip.  Marty was an excellent server and had terrific suggestions for food and drink!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend and his colleagues. The environment is interesting. No privacy and too loud. The food was much to heavy for me, I just ordered some champagne and cheese with bread. The bread was burnt and so hard that when I bit into it, it was a struggle. I didn't even finish the bread because it was so burnt. The champagne was good! I guess this place is just for hungry ASU students. :)"}
{"text":"So much fun!  We came in on a crowded Saturday night  and waited at the  bar. We were so fortunate to be seated outside for dinner. My fiancé had grilled cheese sliders which were \"amazing\" according to him since there were none left for me to sample (o:  I had the mussels created with sausage and roasted tomatoes.  OMG, they were amazing. I loved every bite (o:    Great service, great experience. Already talking about when we can go back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, nacho deluxe with carne asada but drinks were generally okay okay. I had mug less Moscow mule."}
{"text":"This place is hipster to the max!!  I mean, this place literally reeks of hipster which to some may not be such a bad thing..haha.

Overall the food was pretty good.  The fried chicken is a must!  One of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  I'd pass on the pork belly nachos.  For some reason, I expected chunks (like cubed) pork belly, but instead it was like shredded pork (sort of like pulled pork) marinated in some sauce and plopped on top of nachos.  The bacon bloody mary was pretty good although I think I've had better."}
{"text":"We dined here over the weekend and the food and service was spectacular! Our server (I unfortunately didn't catch his name) couldn't have been nicer. He made sure we all got food and beverages to our liking and was very passionate and knowledgable about the menu. The food was great - fresh made and delicious. The decor very cool as well. I recommend the homemade bread appetizer and the apricot wheat beer to start. Overall, a great place to have a beer and hangout before the night really kicks off!"}
{"text":"First off, we were met with really good service. The server was really knowledgable about the whole menu and his advice led to a great meal. 

The cheese and meats were delicious. They also have a gluten free menu. 

As far as the drinks go, I had a smashed Irishman and it was crazy good."}
{"text":"To start we called for a group of 14 and they said they did not take reservations.  OK I can live with that but when we get there and ask for a table we get an answer that there is a 2 hr wait for a table for that big a group so we say how about 2 tables of 7.  Still an 1 hour and 15 min wait.  Some of our group say \"not interested\" in waiting that long so we end up with 9 left.  We go to wait at the bar and the bar tenders are less than friendly although we are running a tab and consuming quite a bit of alcohol!  After 40 minutes we see a table of 8 cleared and set but it's not for us but only 4 people sit down.  WTF???  After another 30 minutes I get incensed as there are still only 4 people at that table and our group of 9 are still waiting!  I go to the front desk and talk to some person with a \"beret\" on (who I guess is the general manager) and let him know my frustration and he gives me some BS about reservations and they take them but they were booked a week ago blah, blah, blah...  I ask him about the table of 8 with only 4 people at it and I get  more BS about they seat people when half there group there and they are drinking... blah, blah, blah .... what about my group of 9 who where drinking at the bar and generating more revenue than the 4 people at the table.  So we finally get our table after an hour and 20 mins.  We are not exactly happy campers.  The servers were very nice though.  I asked to talk to a manager and another gentleman comes over to talk to us.  He is very nice and listens and apologizes for our inconvenience and even buys us a round of drinks.  OK a peace offering.  But he says that their food is the \"best around\" and my response is we'll have to see about that.   I ordered the Korean steak and it was good- I make this myself so it wasn't over the top  but good.  My friend ordered the same as I medium rare but his came out well done except for a single piece. Last another person in the group ordered a burger med rare and it was well done - they did bring another burger that was cooked properly.


The food was good - not extraordinary.  The front desk crew also wasn't very cordial.  Lastly their general manager was a \"Richard\"...."}
{"text":"Walked in to find the typical louder than I can think or hear restaurant.  It was downhill from there.  Service was extremely slow.  Took a long time for the waitress to come to our table.  Took a long time to get our drinks.  Took a long time to get the waitress back to order food.  Took about 1/2 hour to get food.  Food came to the table both dishes were barely warm - likely cooled off waiting for the delivery waitress.  My Chili Verde had no verde.  This is chili out of a can purchased from a local grocery store. Worst restaurant chili ever.  My wife's dish was lukewarm and uneventful."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch because the patio looked inviting. We waited 25 minutes to be seated which was fine. We had the ciabatta bread with oil and balsamic as an appetizer. It was pretty good. I had the \"Yesterday's Soup\" which was French Onion and my husband ordered a burger, cooked to medium and fries. First our waiter came and said our meal would soon be out. A large table next to us that came after us received their food including burgers. Then another waiter stopped and said our waiter said to tell us our food would be out soon. By now it seemed that maybe our order had gotten lost. At least we ate our ciabatta so we were willing to be patient. Our food finally came out, all was good until my husband got into his burger a ways and realized it was basically raw in the middle. We called the attention of our waiter and he took it back. You know how that goes. I was done with my soup  when they brought a whole new burger out. My husband said it was good but what really disappointed us is that when the waiter brought our bill there was no apology and no offer of free dessert or compensation for the screw up.  Maybe if we hadn't been so nice and patient they would of been more accommodating.  First and last time we go there. (The real kicker is that in their drink menu they boast about how much they love you, haha)"}
{"text":"The pretzels are awesome..... I went with a group of girls our service was great she was able to split our checks for us even though she didn't seem very excited about it. Service was great,  drinks were great and most of the food was great 1 girl complained about the kale salad she said it wasn't her favorite but it was ok. No other complaints"}
{"text":"I like the alternative atmosphere and decor with lots of different style seating areas.  There is a good selection of beer and high-end bar food.  The happy hour prices are good but the portions are smaller than the full-priced counterparts.  Try the \"Beer in a Bag\" to entertain yourself and your friends.  I would give a higher rating but the service is somewhat spotty.  I've had good servers there but have also had several with poor skills and attitude."}
{"text":"This gastropub has the fanfare of any gastropub out there in regards to atmosphere and decor. 

The tables here are awkwardly wide, and because it's loud in here you're gonna end up yelling to have a convo. Also, it's unnecessarily dark. I was  tempted to follow suite with other diners who pulled out their flashlights to read their menus. But now you know why my food photos are so dark!

The kitchen thoughtfully split our kale salad  (which was tasty with the sweet potatoes & asparagus and tahini vinaigrette) but we had to wait around for our server to get side plates for our ribs.

Ribs were really good. The caramelized molasses and the flavors of the rub were infused into the meat. The fries were crisp but the coleslaw was soggy and tasted old.

I think this venue is geared more towards a snacking, throwing back a couple pints and enjoying live music than a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I brought my parents here while they were in town on vacation and all of us left raving about how great this place was.  
We had the soft pretzel rolls and provolone fondue appetizer, I could have eaten 3 orders of this my myself, it was so amazing!  We also had prosciutto, super tasty, very fresh and seemed high quality.
I had the Korean Style steak something, I forget the name of it because I was so  obsessed with how delicious it was!  Super tender, juicy, flavorful....yum!
My Dad had fried chicken, which we all agreed was the best fried chicken we had ever had, seriously the best I've ever had in my life.
For dessert we shared monkey bread, my parents said it was a little undercooked, which was their only critique of the night, but that's exactly how I like, so no complaints here.  We also had the caramel custard with caramel corn on top, which was fantastic.  The crunch of the popcorn on top with the creamy custard underneath was a great combination.  
I'm not a big drinker, but we tried some pretty cool cocktails, my favorite was the bloody mary with the bacon strip in lieu of the celery.  
I also loved the atmosphere, really pretty chandeliers and lights, big comfy chairs, and cool industrial vibe.  
Can't wait to go back....might actually go tonight!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the service is awful.   I ordered dinner and the food arrived before the beer I ordered.   40 minutes to get a beer.   I have been here 3 times and the service gets worse everytime."}
{"text":"I've been to Culinary Dropout for dinner several times now and have always had a good experience. We tend to eat early so I haven't encountered the lines or service problems other reviews have mentioned. We've always been seated immediately and have had great service. A few people have mentioned the way the staff dresses; it is true that the female staff dresses somewhat.... uniquely. I'll just say the words \"wholesome family restaurant\" are probably not what comes to mind. 

Anyway, all I care about is the food, which is excellent. My daughter loves the Iberico ham. Their Iberico isn't the 36-month aged acorn-fed amazing stuff you get at Robuchon, but is still quite good. My other favorites there are the Korean-style ribeye cap, fish and chips, pub burger, and fried chicken. The ribeye cap is a must-have, imho. Tender, juicy, and a unique flavor from the marinade. The batter used on the chicken and fish and chips is really nice - very light and airy, crisp and crunchy. The fish in the fish and chips is fresh and flaky. Flavors in the chicken and fish and chips aren't particularly unique or interesting, but the batter, quality ingredients, and perfect cooking really serve to elevate them. The pub burger (with bbq sauce and bacon) is flavorful and juicy. The only dish I've been disappointed with was the meatloaf. Waiters on two visits recommended the meatloaf so I broke down and tried it even though I'm not a meatloaf fan. Sad to say that after trying it I'm still not a meatloaf fan. YMMV if you're partial to meatloaf.

Drinks are a bit pricey, and I wouldn't pick this as the place to guzzle cocktails but the bar area always seems to be hopping. 

Overall, one star off for lacking a bit more creativity in the menu, but four stars for solid execution on what they do have, along with very comfortable seating at both tables and booths."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Their Monkey bread desert is awesome...just took about 30 minutes to make (Which my girlfriend swears the bartender forgot to place the order)....overall great experience."}
{"text":"Maybe I am just getting pickier with each review and less generous with my stars, but I am trying to figure out why the previous reviewers raved so much about Culinary Dropout.  There are certainly things to love . . . the expansive outdoor patio with some of the most comfortable seating around. It's great for people-watching as it fronts Camelback Road, just across the street from Scottsdale Fashion Square. On a hot and hazy summer afternoon, we were still very content sitting on the patio.

On the negative side . . . The food was not even so-so.  I expected so much more from a Sam Fax Restaurant. We have been fans for years with True Food, North, The Greenhouse and the now-closed Bloom, and they are on our regular dining rotation.  Culinary Dropout was how its name sounded, someone dropped the culinary part when they made our meals. I had a hard time finding something that even sounded appetizing on the menu!  We started with the potato chips and onion dip. Nothing to write home about, although I think that if I had a real salt craving, these might just satisfy it. Maybe I should have ordered the pretzel and provolone fondue . . . 

For an entree I ordered the ricotta gnocchi with sausage and mushroom . . . sure sounded like a winner . . . NOT! The gnocchi and sauce were pretty tasteless, and the mushrooms and sausage were so salty I couldn't eat them. Mix them all together and it tasted even worse. My husband ordered the Beef Stroganoff and was very disappointed.  There was no sour cream taste whatsoever. Boring was what he called it.

So the food is not up to par with the rest of the Fox restaurants, but the worst part was the service. The place was pretty empty, and while our server was attentive to our needs prior to our order, after our food was delivered, he pretty much disappeared -- no water refills, no iced tea refills . . . nothing. On a 106 degree day, that should never happen on the patio!!

Needless to say, we won't be making any trips back to Culinary Dropout!"}
{"text":"Great meal great atmosphere great prices would highly recommend. first time in Scottsdale and plan on going back to eat again before I leave!

A group of three of us went there for dinner. We were greeted promptly and seated immediately the place was full but service was quick."}
{"text":"This place wasn't as good as the hype surrounding it. The food was expensive and not super health conscious, just creative. I thought the pretzel cheese fondue everyone talks about was way too salty. The fabulous elements of this place are in its seating, decor, games and ambience. The mood is totally urban and for adults that want to drink. Since we don't drink, it wasn't as fun for us and way too loud. My parents took us out for my husbands birthday, and it felt a little too rowdy to visit even though they liked being hip in the city."}
{"text":"First off- the food was very good. I had the buratta appetizer which was great and a chicken club sandwich that was good. The bad was the rushed service. We were just seated and the waitress came by for drinks order,  We stated we had not had a chance to look at the specialty cocktail list as yet. Came back in 5 minutes and asked again, we still were undecided and she proceeded to tell us what was good- fine, we ordered and said we were looking still for food items- she then gave run down on food items and instead of allowing us time to look and decide asked again for our order. Okay we ordered. Half way through eating she comes back to ask about our dessert order. Uh, yeah we are still working on our dinner- we state we have not looked yet. The restaurant was not full and they were not busy. Comes back again while we are still eating to ask again about dessert, we say no thanks. She the brings the check while we are still eating dinner. WTF. I ask for more water and she asks \"Sure, do you want it in a to go cup?\" Are you kidding me. I can almost understand if they were packed and people were waiting to get in. Still rude, but this was ridiculous. We would have stayed and had more drinks if the service was good, but and that point we left ASAP."}
{"text":"My favorite place to bring out of town guests. Great food, relaxed but polished atmosphere, and great service. 

Best appetizers are the black mussels and the soft pretzels with provolone fondue. 

Make reservations for larger parties or on a busy Friday/Saturday night."}
{"text":"Huge fan!  Service, food and atmospere.  I have been there now twice within 3 week and plan to return again soon."}
{"text":"Loved Culinary dropout...the food is Amazing. Try the ribs; they are de-lish!"}
{"text":"I eat here about once a month and am generally pleased with the menu and selections. The pretzels with cheese is a craving must have for me when I come here. I visited the other night and wanted to start with the meatballs however they are no no longer on the menu. I was pretty bummed to hear that considering I specifically went there for those that night.  I hope they bring them back."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE !!!! I took my friends out 2 eat yesterday & I ordered the Fried Chicken Dinner & the Chicken was Phenomenal ! The Coleslaw was ok needed sum more mayo but the Mashed Potatoes was  ( Thumbs Up ) , Biscuit needed sum more Flavor , it wasn't bad but it needed that Kick... Overall the Food was 8 out of 10... Service was Great , Connor was my waiter , he was cool & keep my drinks flowing.. (Pepsi only) , they have a Ping-pong table u can play After u get done eating.. It's also a bag throwing game on the side.. I like the Place , first seen it @ the Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas ,Nevada so I wanted 2 see how good it was in Arizona & I wasn't disappointed..."}
{"text":"The food was alright.  I wasn't wowed.  The seared tuna salad was good.  The deserts were average.  The money bread came out raw. Service was good."}
{"text":"Cool vibe and all, but the $16 bowl of stew was pitifully small - the stew barely covered the bottom of the bowl!"}
{"text":"In a sentence: Culinary Dropout is a foodie mecca with its plush and lux furnishings, amazing location in the heart of Scottsdale but away from the duche-ery of Old Town, on point entrees that range from classic to what I call contemporary chef-y food, and its trendy lil touches like dishtowels for nanpkins and placemat menus. 

After a short afternoon of shopping, I and the other Musketeers ventured into CD in search of yummy goodness... we weren't disappointed. We scarfed down the Pretzel and cheese fondue. Sorry, I can't remember the exact cheese used, but it tasted like cheez whiz without the nasty chemical aftertaste. 

Musketeer #1 had the Shrimp Po' Boy sammy and was overwhelmingly awesome! With its fresh baguette, crispy shrimp and cole slaw topping, this po boy claimed to have died several times. The fries were good, I'm sure they are awesome with the steak. Musketeer #2 had the truffle egg scramble. She said that it was good... not bad... but not terrific. We love the truffle, and this did deliver however... it just missed something... je ne sai quai... just something. I stole a bite and concurred... the low point in a overall great meal. 

and me, Miss Musketeer #3 had the coq a vin... a MUST! If that or braised short ribs are on the menu... they MUST be ordered! That's the rule my friends. My braised chicken was good, kind of on the sweet side, but over all very good, although the chicken did have an odd texture, it seemed to me that it could have used a few more hours in the oven. I think this is a dish best served before closing when all the flavors had their chance to really marry. We arrived at the top of dinner service and so the chicken was done... but barely.

Musketeer #2 and I both NEEDED bread and butter, our cooler-than-thou waiter was happy to oblige, even though it took a VERY long time t find him to ask for it in the first place. We capped off the meal with their \"famous\" Monkey Bread, it was definatly worth going bananas over! Warm, gooey, delicious and crazy sweet with its pull-apart goodness it didn't need the ice cream it was served with, but we certainly weren't about to send it back! The three of us died over that one! 

To my yelpers I say: if you have the cash to spend (three of us cost a lil over a hundred clams), a few hours spend on dinner (we were there a while) and a NEED to reach foodie nirvana in order to keep from jumping off a cliff into the chain resturant valley... then this is the spot for you! Bring your most expensive IT bag, a pair of oversized shades, maybe a sweater (the outdoor heaters really didn't work) and your most predestroyed designer deconstructed jeans and get ready!! It's gonna be a blast!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Every time I've come here is somehow better than the next. Today my boyfriend and I got the meatloaf sand which in happy hour which was perfect. The bun was baked to perfection and the flavor was amazing. We got roasted brussels sprouts on the side, i wish I knew they were coming out cold but I loved everything else so much that this place still deserves 5 stars. We started with the prosciutto deviled eggs (phenomenal) chips and onion dip and I highly recommend those! So good for how inexpensive they are! I was very vague with what I wanted as a cocktail and the sweet bartender, Lindsey made me the most delicious drink! The other bartender on duty, Chase was also very nice and helpful. I'm in love with the overall ambiance of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time to celebrate my daughters birthday, made a reservation trough open table and mentioned it was a celebration, I also mentioned it to the front desk but there was no  acknowledgment of such. Food was good even though service was a little slow, understandable since it was pretty busy. Overall pretty good."}
{"text":"Slow service and cold (but edible) food. Atmosphere shows it has a lot of potential but \"laid back\" doesn't mean you sacrifice good customer service. Not a spot we'd go to again as there are a lot of better options available."}
{"text":"Pretzel app is killer and a MUST order. Fun atmosphere. Beer knowledgeable!! The burger is tasty and the chicken curry is different but tasty!!! You cannot go wrong with the food. Fish and chips is not overly doughy and good taste."}
{"text":"We were just here on Sunday for brunch to celebrate finishing our school and the location is great. The lighting inside and general energy of the place is awesome. Parking was decent and even though we made a reservation, I doubt the wait would not have been too bad by the time we all gathered around 12. We shared the pretzel bites and cheese, definitely will order again. Then I ordered the salmon avocado toast, for $13. I don't usually have avocado toast but I love salmon so I was excited for it, but the portion of protein was ridiculously small. I could have gone to Einstein's, ordered a nova lox and gotten more salmon served to me for less. I ordered the lipstick and earrings as a drink and it was okay, a bit more savory than I was expecting for something that has orange juice and berries. Our service was great, but having been to enough locally owned restaurants, I wouldn't say what your paying matches to the portions. Maybe stick to the apps and a drink to share rather than pay for a full meal here."}
{"text":"We liked the vibe here. Things to do for all ages. The food was pretty good, though there were not a ton of options for vegetarians. The staff was friendly and helpful. 

I recommend making a reservation. I called 45 min ahead and asked if we should. The hostess said the wait wouldn't be too bad. Then we got there and the wait was 45 min for a table. They comped our drinks as an apology."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 6 pm on Saturday before checking out Zac Brown Band. So glad we had reservations as we were walking in, the hostess was telling a party of three, who did not have reservations, the place was completely booked for the night. Maybe it was due to ZBB performing there that night or maybe that's the usual for a Saturday night. I'm not sure. The hostess was super pleasant and our servers were pretty chill and laid back. Not too obtrusive which is just the way I like it.

The restaurant's decor is fabulous. English Pub meets Vintage Hollywood. Perfect for the Hard Rock. Hip and cool and definitely caters to a younger crowd (or the young at heart). We were seated by the window, which ended up being a quieter table (relatively speaking, of course. The place is loud and unapologetic about it. It is the Hard Rock, after all. Quiet and romantic this place is not.). 

The BF ordered the grilled cheese sliders with fries. I didn't care for either. The bread on the grilled cheese was way too thick, too hard, and dry. Not enough butter, in my opinion. I like my grilled cheese more on the greasy side. The cheese tasted slightly grainy. Maybe the provolone fondue set the bar too high for me that night. The bacon was sparse and a little overdone. The fries were okay. Nothing special about em. The dish looked good but I didn't think it tasted as good as it looked.

I ordered the highly recommended pretzels and provolone fondue based on yelp recommendations. Truth be told, that dish is why I wanted to go to Culinary Dropout. And a little more truth...before I give my opinion on the dish, I need to say I've been going low carb for a while so when I indulge, it needs to be good or I will be a big, terrible, cranky, mean monster. It's true. This was my night to cheat and I was going to do it BIG.

So, was it worth it? Oh. Yeah. 

Did I stuff myself silly?  Yes. Yes, I did. I did share one or two pieces but I wasn't happy about it. 

The pretzels nuggets looked perfect and smelled so good! Deep brown in color and perfectly textured. Crunchy exterior yielding to warm, chewy, and airy interior. Honestly, I could have skipped the fondue entirely. But, I didn't. This was my cheat night, after all! The cheese was excellent. It was a simple meal. But it was a good meal. And I'm still thinking about it..."}
{"text":"Excellent location, plenty of parking, and the food was delicious.  We like trying new things, so tried the strawberry jalapeño margarita (it had a fancy name but I can't remember it!) - it was absolutely delicious, as was the classic mule.  The deviled eggs were very good, and I had to try it the prime rib dip sandwich, even if it was $17.  I hate to pay that much for a sandwich, but I have to say it was one of the best I've ever had.  Our server was attentive and explained the background of the restaurant since this was our first visit & was very nice.  I only gave this four stars, because two drinks and a sandwich cost me $45.  I would love to come back again & again, but at that price point I'm not sure I can afford to - but I sure will try!"}
{"text":"Great food, but pricey. We had the pretzel and artichoke appetizers, fried chicken, grilled cheese sliders, and fried shrimp salad. Everything they serve is non.standard versions of what you might get elsewhere. We would dine here more often if we didn't walk out spending $30pp."}
{"text":"The name says it all, culinary dropout, food and service both worthy of expulsion. 

I have never been so disappointed or disrespected in a restaurant as I was at culinary dropout.  I placed an order for pickup and when I arrived, the food was sitting by the cash register at the bar in the open. It wasn't under a heat lamp or in anything to keep it warm, I even made a comment to the rude bartender who wanted to finish drying his wine glasses before approaching me asking why the food wasn't being kept warm and that it would be cold before getting home and his response was that it was warm. Then he printed out the check and all he said was \"cheers!\" 

I ordered the steak, fish and chips and soft pretzel, all of which were cold and soggy, the steak was already cut up and half of it was fat. Not just marbled with fat, pure  yellow fat! The fries were soggy, fondue dipping sauce was solidified, fish and chips were cold and limp. 

Giving the restaurant one star is generous, they can bet their bottom dollar I won't be returning,"}
{"text":"Great spot for food and drinks! Only reason not 5 star is the Bacon Bloody Mary was disappointing, barely and bacon and presentation lacked"}
{"text":"This restaurant aims to please. The food is fantastic. I've been 3 times, and it will continue to be a place I bring guests from out of town."}
{"text":"TO DIE FOR! My family and I were on vacation and I found this place and decided to try it out and I'm so glad we did. I got the kale salad and it was like I was in heaven. My brother got the fried chicken and he ate the whole thing but thought the mash potatoes tasted like cupcakes in his opinion. 10/10 would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"CD is my favorite bar/restaurant inside my favorite hotel casino in Las Vegas.  A very good yet eclectic drink selection, small but good beer selection and a varied menu.  Add this all up to include a cheerful & competent wait staff and bartenders.....ding ding ding!!  We have ourselves a winner folks!  Others have spoke about the awesome happy hour specials so there's nothing more I can add to what's been said already.

Speaking of the bartenders, Jamie was very attentive and knowledgeable about the various drinks to choose from. She is the best of an already good group.  Her pleasant and happy demeanor made a good place that much better.  Needless to say, anytime I'm back in Las Vegas, a visit to CD will be on my agenda!"}
{"text":"Service is awesome. Food is ok, Mediocre, price doesn't match the taste"}
{"text":"I'm only giving them an extra star because my most recent visit was the only terrible experience I've had out of the four times I have came to this place. 

The food ugh! My pretzels were burnt twice (who burns pretzels is this even possible?) I also ordered the famous fried chicken one was too burnt..one was under cooked... one was just right. Besides my awesome waiter and my perfect drink my experience has cause doubts of the longevity of the chain in the typical five yr life span in the Valley. What was once great not so much and I hope this was a one time only incident with a under experienced cook. I will try one more time before I cut them off completely...but foodies beware quality is at risk.  

To be fair my previous experiences have been 4 stars and they have a great patio area (backyard atmosphere) where you can play adult games with your friends and frenemies!"}
{"text":"The Hard Rock on a Sunday night - empty!  I was here for dinner with a friend and we shared some Charcuterie to start then I sampled their \"famous\" fried chicken.  There was some initial confusion because both our drink menu and our charcuterie options were outdated, but the server handled it well and I was happy with the tasty soppresseta and cheese.  I think it is a little much to charge for bread when I am paying for both meat and cheese separately, but with a few accompaniments, we could have easily made this our meal.
I thought the fried chicken wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, either.  It came with a large biscuit, but no butter and the cole slaw was incredibly bland.  The drumstick and thigh were both juicy, but the breast was quite tough.
We finished with the baked-to-order apple monkey bread, which was meh.
All in all, this wouldn't be worth a trip to the Hard Rock, but if you were there already and hungry, you could find some decent food."}
{"text":"This is another entry from the Fox Restaurant Concepts folks. Typically, I find their restaurants to be a bit over-priced, over-hyped and uninspired. The prices here are better, for sure, but the menu is still....eh....blah. I sat and stared at it for an hour before we headed over and I truthfully wasn't that interested in eating anything on the menu. It's not that creative and healthy is a bit lacking. However, that being said, the staff is wonderful, and what they do have the menu, they do well.

I wish their happy hour went until 7 but that's alright, the wine and beer list is extensive and the prices are fair. I don't know that I would pay what they were asking for their cocktails, though. My husband had the chicken hash which was exactly as described and was a pretty good, authentic hash. I would love if they used Yukon golds or red potatoes instead of russets since russets tend to get a little mealy but the flavors were good. I had the artichoke salad and had grilled chicken added to it no problem. This was very good, very light and very large! I got a dinner, a snack and a lunch out of this. The veggies are very, very thinly sliced so you get very subtle hints of the endive and the asparagus as well as the artichokes and the dressing is a nice, light, vinegar and oil (I'm thinking cider vinegar based on a subtle sweetness). We did have the soft prezel appetizer which was good. I would prefer them to change their presentation on this one, though. The fondue put is far too large for the amount of cheese they give you (the amount of cheese is fine) but it looks silly reaching down to the bottom of the oversized pot. The melted provolone had a lovely texture, was not lumpy or thick and was a perfect compliment to the sea-salted pretzel bites. We split it amongst three and didn't finish it all. 

Overall, ambiance is good, staff is friendly, service is quick and the food is decent. I just wish the menu had a little more oomph or something that made you go \"Oh! I HAVE to try that!!\" I wouldn't come back here on my own but if a friend suggested it again as happened last night, I wouldn't say no."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or just hanging out.  Went for lunch yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered but especially the house potato chips with \"famous\" onion dip and the pretzel fondue as appetizers and for entrees the fried chicken and the amazing turkey pastrami sandwich.  My wife's fried chicken came with a biscuit that she said was the best she has ever had and she's a biscuit-aholic, so that's saying something.  My turkey pastrami sand on a pretzel roll was equally fantastic...so we're definitely looking to go back, soon!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but then they ruined my favorite dish.  The Italian Chop Salad was perfect in texture and flavor, and found a perfect balance in the amount of lettuce versus other ingredients.  Then it became the Italian Wedge, which turned it into a labor of love, you had to wrestle with it.  Then they changed it back to a \"Chop\", but changed the ingredients, added corn, and turned it into a bowl full of chopped up slop with barely any lettuce. Just horrible.  Once a place ruins my favorite dish, I don't go back."}
{"text":"A restaurant with a good theme inside a mall.

I haven't spent much time in AZ, so I don't know how it compares to other establishments, but when I go to a restaurant inside a mall, I expect food for the masses.

The menu had good selection across many different varieties/genres of food. The drinks were eclectic and well prepared. The food the same.

The patrons were mixed - from Coco Crisp on Spring Training from the Oakland A's, to 20's and 30's to snowbirds in retirement.

Outdoor seating with a bar facing the outdoor seating was nice."}
{"text":"Great food, cool gastropubby atmosphere, good happy hour deals. Sangria is good but different. Thick like juice and no fruit chunks in it."}
{"text":"Hip meets gastro-pub with a dash of college fun. I loved this place. The food was comfort with a twist and wonderful.  The space itself is massive both inside and out.  Outside is covered with mist machines to keep it cool.  They have tons of games as well.  This place would be fun to get \"over served\" in.  I would highly suggest coming here.  In short good food, great atmosphere and a lot of fun."}
{"text":"For me, Culinary Dropout was just OK.  Nothing was actually wrong, but it felt like the brainchild of a restaurant group that it is.  The decor is is retro like all new restaurants are these days - tufted banquettes and wing chairs - not like the sleek modern restaurants I normally associate with Scottsdale. And the menu is of course comfort food - again like every other new restaurant.  Sandwiches, fried chicken, even a potato chip/onion dip appetizer. (Haven't had that for at least 25 years.)  Four of us went for dinner during a girls weekend on Sunday night and it really wasn't that busy considering it's high season in Phoenix.  All the food was uniformly good but nothing was terribly original or different.

I'm surprised it won a best new restaurant award from Phoenix Magazine last year.  Then again, new restaurants were few and far between last year in Phoenix.  If your goal is comfort food done well, you'll probably like this place.  And the prices are certainly more reasonable than its big sister across the street, Modern Steak."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to trying this restaurant for a long time. We went with a group and I ordered the Bistro Steak, Medium with asparagus instead of Brussel Sprouts.  The steak came out and I thought it was chicken because it was so done. I tasted it, but the waiter never came back, there were also brussel sprouts on the plate. At the end of the meal, I passed the steak off to my friend and he told the waiter why I did not eat it. The manager refused to take it off the tab and never even visited our table.The waiter told me it was because he checked on me and I said it was fine. I and everyone around me disagreed with him  and told him that I did not touch my food and waited for him to come back. He acted surprised and thought he had. I told him it was fine, but I would not be back and I was disappointed because I had heard so many positive reviews.  I did not tip him well since my understanding was the reason the manager would not remove the food from my bill was because he had said I told him it was fine. I told him I would be posting this on yelp. If you go to Tempe, pick a place who values their customers."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Friday (in the summer) and was able to be seated right away with a party of four.  The atmosphere in the place is really fun, and the beer list is pretty unique!  (A few beers you won't find at many places, and a few I hadn't even heard of!)  There was a good amount of seating outside as well with the misters going so plenty of space!

I had the sweet corn cannelloni and it was amazing!  I would go here again just for that dish!  My husband had the pub burger and he said it was very good as well.  The portion sizes are great, the plating looks like a high-end place, and the waiters were really nice and helpful with selecting from the menu when we had questions.  The price is not too cheap, but not too expensive...think a few bucks more than a Chili's or Applebees, but with WAY better food!

I'll definitely go again, and would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my husband and some friends for lunch. I had the pork belly ramen, and it was awesome. The pork was very tender and the whole thing was well balanced. We also had the pretzels w/ fontina fondue, I could have made a meal out of that!"}
{"text":"Great service and the nachos were amazing. The ribs were not as good as advertised, but then again I'm probably spoiled. If you go, try the nachos."}
{"text":"Been meaning to come here for a while, happy I did. Keeping in mind they didn't have much for \"lighter\" food. Will probably be back in the near future. 

Although there aren't many low calorie options, it's a good place to splurge on fried chicken, gravy & biscuits which was delicious. 
We got a charcuterie of capocollo & prosciutto with a sheep cheese & a white cheddar, all of which were delicious. Could have had more cheese on the plate but the meat quantity was good. 
The seared ahi tuna salad was pretty good, nothing special. 
Our server was pretty good until the end. She was very knowledgeable & helped with any all questions. When it came time for the bill, for some reason she slipped up & kept taking a while. 
I would like to come back & try more things from the menu."}
{"text":"I decided to check out Culinary Dropout pretty soon after it opened.  I was a little reluctant since I went to Modern Steak during its first week, and it was a disaster.  When I entered the restaurant, I liked what I saw.  Good ambiance.  I put in my name and waited at the bar for my table to be ready.  The beer selection was good, we settled on the Chimay.  After 30 minutes went by, I went back to the hostess to see why we hadn't been seated.  For some reason they had crossed off my name without seating us.  Not the best start.  We got to the table and ordered the pretzel fondue appetizer.  The cheese was a little bland, but it was ok.  For a meal we split the chicken salad and pork ribs.  The chicken salad was great.  Definitely the highlight of the meal.  The pork ribs were way too sweet, had almost no meat on the bones, and the cole slaw was bland.  I would not order this again.  Overall, I would return to the restaurant for a happy hour or for drinks and a cheese plate, but probably won't be returning for dinner."}
{"text":"This was the coolest restaurant I've ever been too. The atmosphere was awesome and the food was even better. I had the shrimp cesar salad and it was the best thing I've ever had!!! The band was great too."}
{"text":"The food was so good. My classmates and I came here to celebrate after completing our 2nd grad. residency. Although the flies were a bit distracting (with the windows and doors open), the food made up for it if you can eat before the flies do lol.

The fried chicken was awesome."}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night last week for a friends birthday,  We sat at a table in the back near the bar.   The chairs were great!.   The service was pretty bad.  Took forever to get drinks and the server never came around to check on us.   It took about 10 to 15 min to get the drinks to us.   The servers don't wear polo shirts or any type of uniform either.  So it was hard to find them.    Also  the hamburger we had tasted like a big mac from McDonalds  I guess it was called the mac Burger maybe it was suppose to taste like that.    The pretzels were awesome though.  They came out in pretzels balls  best ever.    Hope they work on the service at the tables.  The bartenders were great!   I asked for a Pepsi and she gave it to me free!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!

Incredible food! We had the mussels with spicy sausage & pretzels with provolone fondue and the kale & butternut squash salad. I'm so full and jolly- just like Santa... Minus the beard.

Great craft beer and cocktail menu!

I would give more stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Went to Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale one late afternoon last week with my son and daughter-in-law.
We ordered 5 appetizers for 4 of us.  The truffle cheese came as a blob on a wood board without any crackers/bread to put it on.  The deviled eggs were the worst we had ever eaten.  It seems that the almonds came out of 2 different containers. The top layer was only OK and the bottom almonds were going rancid.  Trader Joe's almonds are much better and less expensive.  When presented to us, the contents of the presentation board leaked all over the table making a big mess.  We had to clean up the table ourselves with our napkins and had to ask for clean napkins, which took a while.
The men at the table ordered beers.  One came out as half foam from a can of beer and not even the whole can, we returned it.
Getting refills of tea was a major chore.
The entrees were no better.  My husband ordered the fried chicken because it had 2 stars on the menu and we thought it would be something special.  It came to the table just short of being burnt and the meat was so dry he couldn't eat it.  It tasted like it was cooked in old oil. The mashed potatoes were lukewarm and had something, we still haven't figured out what the flavor was, but he wouldn't eat it.  The biscuit was dry and there was no butter.   All in all, this meal was awful and had no flavor.
My daughter-in-law and I split a turkey pastrami sandwich.  It had chunks of what tasted like horseradish on it.  This was not in the description of the sandwich and neither of us liked it.
I also had a small salad.  There has never been a salad that I would not eat until now.  The dressing didn't have any flavor and the salad must have been sitting around for a while because it was totally limp.
The up side of this experience is that we also ordered mussels and they were the only thing that was good.
Over all the service was very poor and the food so bad that we will NEVER go back.
We spent over $100++ for a very bad experience.  The manager did comp the fried chicken meal."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. Where do I start?...  Service:  server brought one drink at a time for our party of four. Not sure if he didn't hear the order or if different drinks come from different bars. Rah member of the party got their drink at a different time. Ordered 2 apps. The first one came out but the second never did. We thought it was going to be a pattern like our drinks, but soon after the first app dinners started to arrive. We received 3 of the 4 and waited a few minutes for the fourth. In the mean time, the salad that was ordered was missing the chicken. 10 minutes later a small, cut up chicken breast was delivered. Server seemed to begin ignoring our table. Food wasn't bad, but didn't live up to the hype as seen on local news shows. Very average. We ordered fish n chips, a few sandwiches and the Kale Salad with chicken. Great bar atmosphere with corn-hole and fire pits. We may return to hang out, but won't return to eat. Cooks shouldn't have dropped out of culinary school. To top it off, valet service moved their station during dinner and we wandered the parking lot looking for the workers. A true comedy or errors."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and the atmosphere is good. It's nothing that special, but exactly what to expect out of a Fox Restaurant Concept."}
{"text":"Let me say first that I have and currently work in the restaurant industry, both as front and back of house.

The food was very good, as I would expect from a fox concept. We shared the pretzel fondue and the pork belly Cuban. The both were great and came very quickly (I am a sucker for all things pork belly) 

The food alone made it a 4 star( a bit pricey but it IS Scottsdale fashion) however the atrocious service made for a 2 star review.

Our server started off ok, greeted us and got our drink orders (a couple of iced teas) then brought the drinks and took our food order. Had I known that getting a refill wouldn't happen I would have paced myself to really savor it.

When our food was ready out server simply handed it over the community bench ( and over my girlfriends head and shoulder) rather than walking it around table side. This seemed downright lazy, and a bit risky and one of the items was steaming fondue for the pretzels.

We didn't see the server again for the duration of the meal, no check in on the food, and my glass sat completely the whole meal. Now I am not afraid to ask for what I need, nor do I need/expect constant attention; however our server was MIA and all the other staff was hanging out by the expo/hostess stand and I wasn't about to go chasing someone down.

Finally when the server reappeared it was to drop the check, then he was kind enough to ask about the refill as he took my card and brought to go boxes.  The last straw was when rather than offering help packing up the to go he dropped the boxes and ran. This left my girlfriend to handle the cast iron mini-pot of fondue ( which held over a tea light was very hot) luckily years of hot pans in kitchens have left my fingers able to handle hot things. I don't see how most people would not burn themselves, seemed like an unsafe practice to me.

Left a 10% tip which is as close as I get to stiffing a server. Having worked in their shoes and seeing servers on the other side of the pass really working their but I generally aim for 20%-25% grat.

Most likely will not return, and will be a little wary of any Sam Fox place I haven't been before.

Recommend any of the other fine Scottsdale eateries in the area just not this Fox concept."}
{"text":"Might be our best meal in Vegas YET! My wife and I ate here at 5pm right before going to a concert at the Joint. Was perfect. In and out in just under an hour. Atmosphere is really slick. Feels like fine dining but without all the pretense that can get old after being in Vegas for a week. 

I would recommend sitting inside. If it's available, the tables that have the leather sofa on one side and a living-room-style padded arm chair on the other side are awesome. You can watch the guys on the line and the wait staff at the pass. Love that they're all in plain clothes and while being very professional, also, being very approachable. 

So for the food...
We started with the Warm Pretzel fondue appetizer. HIGHLY recommend. Especially if you're going to get a burger, because you can use the leftover cheese for your fries! I ordered the Pub Burger which had bacon, havarti & BBQ sauce. SO good. Bun was so fresh and had a great crust on it. Almost like a pretzel as well, but not too hard. Cooked to a PERFECT medium. Was very pleased. Fries weren't much to get excited about, but when using that Cheese fondue, they became amazing. 
My wife had the Beef Stroganoff. It was A+. Beef was so lean and mushrooms were delicious. I love that on the menu they straight-up say \"Frozen Peas\". HA! Again, NO pretense. 

For drinks, I had a Batch 19 Pre Prohibition style lager & my wife had a Smashed Irishman cocktail that she thoroughly enjoyed. I loved that their cocktail menu had silhouette pictures of the style of cup it would come in. They are also sorted into themed pages where each offering on the page is the same price. Very handy.

Didn't save room or time for desert, but the Peanut Butter Chocolate something or other will be on the menu when we make it back next vist to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"While the food is delicious and definitely worth the wait the hostesses need better training. One in a skimpy white romper waited until my fiancé went to the restroom and ripped his seat away while I was casually leaning my arm on it. I was offered a very unapologetic \"sorry\" and wasn't offered any other seating while waiting for 40 minutes. I definitely suggest the Phoenix location over the Tempe one."}
{"text":"Great enviroment, good beer selection and delicious food. What else could you want!"}
{"text":"Opps! How have we not found this place sooner! We will definitely be back! 
The food was amazing! Simple Brussel sprouts and asparagus with some deviled eggs were anything but simple!!! Yummy! 
The pretzel fondue was great and the jerky was perfecto!!! :) 
Cool atmosphere and great service too!"}
{"text":"Awesome outdoor/shaded space with games.   

Food is nothing special.   Small portions for fish and chips and greasy fried chicken.

Can give no stars when I watched the bartender pour a Guinness, out of the tap, in one shot."}
{"text":"Ate here on Friday with some friends and was really impressed! We ordered cocktails and some appetizers and stayed as the live music began.

The drinks were pretty good, though I've had better. I had one drink with banana liqueur in it and it was a bit too sweet for my taste- while my friend had a sake cocktail that was phenomenal. 

The appetizers were really what stole the show! We started with the pretzel fondue as recommended by friends and went nuts! The portion was surprisingly large and the fondue was delicious! We then enjoyed a make your own charcuterie tray with everything from homemade potato chips to goat cheese. The charcuterie tray was a little pricey since it is by item, but still worth it.

Most of all, our waiter was just rad. He looked like K. Fed and had a sick fedora! He was very attentive and checked in with us throughout the night- even when the restaurant got super busy due to outdoor seating rushing inside with an impromptu storm, he still checked in! 

My only meh moment was the live music- it was great but WAY too loud. We weren't even close to the stage and could barely hear half of our party because of how loud it was."}
{"text":"Just had
 dinner there last night before Hall & Oats Concert, great scene and wonderful time had by all. They offer great draught micro-brew beers served cold in a nice pint glass. We both had the soup du jour ( chicken & rice) great stuff. For our entree grilled chicken salad and chicken walnut salad, both were great. Loved there homemade appetizer chips with french onion dip. Bottom line would definitely go again in fact plan on quick revisit."}
{"text":"The tempe location's parking lot is always packed! But then you walk into the restaurant and it's not super packed... busy, but comfortable! That's what I love about this place! It's like you're at the cool kids house,  but can still have a conversation at your table. 
The food of course is delish! This time around we had the chefs board and onion dip with chips! Yum! 
But I think I've had most of the staples and none are disappointing!"}
{"text":"A very eclectic menu here, something for everyone.  The food is excellent, but the music was a little loud for us.  Otherwise, it's a great place to have a very nicely prepared, flavorful meal."}
{"text":"Just about your average place - which is surprising especially being a FOX restaurant. The weirdest thing - happy hour is limited to the bar or patio. Even then the options are no less cheap as compared to regular prices. Makes you wonder if it is indeed happy hour. 

Food was just about OK - nothing to rave about. The one thing I hate is the forced valet. I am old enough to drive and park my own car. And no, I don't want to shell out extra few bucks just because you handled my car without me asking for it. If it is complimentary, why do you need to tip the valet?"}
{"text":"Great spot   Try the fried chicken it's everything you want it to be - just a bit sweet though. 

The spicy kale soup is awesome.  Especially since the fried chicken is so sweet."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the pretzel fondue. They also make a killer moscow mule. Awesome place for dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and games, not so happy about the food. They could improve on some items and it was sort of made to be better than it truly was. Drinks were awesome so I only recommend for appetizers and drinks but not actual dinner."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 1 star only because the food was good.  The service is horrible!!!  From the hostess, to the server, to the manager.  Poor poor poor!!  Get takeout if you want to eat their food or prepared for a whole new type of dining service..Where the customers come in last!  Blah!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time today and it was great. Seeing that there was a line for parking (which is valet by the way) we assumed this place was going to be crazy busy but luckily it wasn't. 
We got seated right away in their patio and got our order taken within a few minutes. 

Our server, Grace, was awesome. She kept coming to check if everything was alright, always had a smile, and made my sister and I feel welcomed.  

I ordered the breakfast burrito, which by the way is amaaaaazing! It came with tasty potatoes and salsa on the side. My sister got a burger and she said that was pretty good. 

Aside from our food, the patio apparently has some games we can play with but there were a few large parties that were in the area so we avoided it, but it looked pretty cool. Also, they have TVs with sport games going on, which I love! 

Overall, this place gets two thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the past year or so. Everything is good. Great atmosphere (at the Hard Rock - Vegas). I could list everything I've had/enjoyed, but I'm sticking with everything is good. Well, not just good. REALLY good. Perfect balance of fancy (food) and casual. Although it's a nice/trendy/hip place, it's not pretentious and the attire is still casual (pretty sure people have come in directly from the pool) and they aren't trying to be over the top clever or trendy with anything. Food is much the same way. Anyway, go here and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The one in tempe was amazing , food was great customer service best I have seen, can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great location.  Nice decor.  The food was adequate, but $13 for the turkey pastrami sandwich was a little high for a lunch.  I guess those chandeliers are expensive and rent at the Waterfront cannot be cheap.  Our server was poorly trained.  She placed the food in front of me instead of the lady first. I asked for water and the server brought only one glass of water and didn't bother to ask about the lady's needs.  This venue is not for those who appreciate fine or even appropriate service.  Sam needs to educate his young servers on the finer points of courtesy.  Our server was also extremely bored with her job, her life, and her existence.  That's the impression we received."}
{"text":"We actually saw this place pop up on Yelp as soon as I turned on my phone when my plane had landed. Based on the reviews, there was no doubt that we had to make time to try this place out. 

The restaurant is located at this huge industrial looking building. It has such a cool vibe!! Pretty sure I'd come here often if I lived nearby. Very large bar that spans across a wide space. Lots of seating. There is even a ton more outside, but we didn't even notice that until we left. 

We compared the menu prices to Bay Area (CA) prices so I'm not sure that it's a fair comparison. But we were happy because a place like this would be so much more at home. We felt like we got a good value for the price  (though it was not inexpensive). 

The food was amazing. I loved everything I had. There was a tiny miss on one thing but I can't even rememeber what it was. I just know that the flavors alone were good but they didnt make a good combination. Yet every other dish was wonderful. 

I hope I can come back again and try more food while spending more time enjoying the establishment!"}
{"text":"It was a great night here!!! Great staff! Very awesome vibe! Good food! I would definitely come back again. The only think to say about this place is don't come hungry and expect to wait about an 1.5 hours or more."}
{"text":"This is definitely the ace to go! They have amazing customer service. Our waitress Ashley Ballard was so fast and always checking on us to see if we needed anything.  Also our busser Jeremy was also a fantastic help! They both deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is a fun spot for dinner and drinks with a group of people.  Everyone loves the pretzels and fondue appetizer, though I find it overrated.  The house potato chips are impressive though!  

It never fails that someone will order the fried chicken, and I'm not sure why it's never been me.  This restaurant is good at comfort food... the meatloaf is worth trying, I've heard great things about the burger, and I love the kale and sweet potato salad.  

Some of the speciality cocktails are pretty good, albeit overpriced.  I stick to some house wine and I'm never disappointed.  Like all Fox Restaurants, their iced tea is lovely.

Make a reservation if you're coming on the weekend, so you avoid a wait.  Then kick back, enjoy some live music and good food in a lively astmosphere!"}
{"text":"First off I will say the food (that we got) was delicious!  The drinks were good too!  But good food and drink will only get you so far with me.  Especially at a concept style restaurant!  Yes the concept draws people in but the service and food needs to keep them coming back.  Waitress greeted us promptly took our drink order. From there 10 minutes for 2 beers and a 2 mixed drinks; it was only 4:30 so it wasn't that busy.  We ordered an appetizer and our entrees together.  It was about 35-40 mins. From the time we sat down until our food came... out waitress was nowhere to be found to ask what was going on.  Then our food arrived; however we never got our appetizer (the pretzel fondue everyone raves about) the food runner didn't know what we were talking about.  She didn't apologize just stated she'll get our waitress.  Before the runner left my sister in law noticed she didn't get dressing with her salad.  The runner just stared at her for 30 seconds we started looking at each other thinking it was some joke... she then says with an attitude umm I need to know what dressing you want.  We told her then she brought it back and with a smug tone she says \"Here's your dressing love bug!!\"  WTF if you were my employee I'd fire you in the spot!!!!! At that time our waitress shows up, didn't apologize about the pretzels ((acted like this happens so much that they were used to it; they've become calloused to kitchen mistakes) we cancelled the order due to our entrees being out.  Didn't offer to comp it nothing just said ok and walked away.  Dinner was done we were getting our check still no acknowledgment of the pretzels not coming out.  Didn't thank us for coming and walked away.  WOW!! I am in the food service business and can't believe this happened... seems like it happens often from other reviews too!  Might be back to try the pretzels one day but most likely try a different place to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious food and service!   Great place to eat before going to the movies !   Fun atmosphere and both indoor and outdoor eating!  Excellent selection of beer and cocktails and the menu offers something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Great food! Try the chicken meatballs. They were delicious. I don't like raw fish... But they are really kind about cooking the shrimp and crab legs in garlic butter so I suggest it to anyone who loves seafood."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm immediately intrigued by any place that has roasted beets AND caramel corn on the menu (as separate dishes, mind you).  Culinary Dropout is not your typical restaurant.  The menu items are creative but not so far out that the food isn't enjoyable.  I loved the crispy shrimp ceasar salad.  They include kale and lemon zest for an interesting twist.  And yes, I tried the roasted beets and caramel corn.  Both were delicious!

As for the decor - meh.  Its appeal is missed on me.  However, I did appreciate the friendly wait staff with their colorful tatoos and piercings.  I liked the fact that the restaurant tries to be different.  It does it well."}
{"text":"First time eating there before a concert the other night and everything about the place is awesome. Ambiance indoor/outdoor, service, cocktails, and of course the food! Pretzel bites, Thai chicken wings, and oysters on the half were all great! Forget which cocktail I had but it came with a Modelo beer to pour in as you go and it was really good, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love, Love this place, Ambiance feels like your going to eat at somebody's home.
Dishes are made to almost perfection, I will definitely come back to try all other items on menu."}
{"text":"Second time at this location, great food and service. 

Menu is seasonal, be on look out for new creations."}
{"text":"Ate here today with a friend (Tempe location) for lunch. Had a nice, attentive waitress who was on top of our order, really appreciated that. We both were drawn to the same menu item, the delicious bacon and BBQ burger. I got mine with fries and my buddy got his with salad, both came out excellent and prepared exactly as we had specified. I have eaten here many times and have never been disappointed. Only reason this isn't a 5 star is because there was nothing that I would consider \"better than expected.\" Was very pleased and will continue to bring people here to experience the yard and the wonderful things it has to offer."}
{"text":"Totally enjoyed our meal here.  We had a Sunday brunch.  It was crowded but you couldn't tell b/c the place is legit massive. However, it doesn't feel like a warehouse.  The décor is hip and very modern but really comfortable.  The food was also very good.  We had mimosas b/c brunch.  We also shared the pretzel bites and cheese fondue which was delicious.  I got the prime rib dip which was very good and my friend got the pub burger.  Our waiter Nathan was great; explained different menu items and was attentive without being a pest.  
I don't live in Tempe or Arizona but its probably a good thing because I could eat here again and again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it. It was a Monday night. I didn't think it would be this super busy. We were a party of 7. They got the order wrong for one. It was for our daughter and it was the turkey sandwich. They were suppose to leave the off the Dijon mustard as well knew my kid wouldn't like it. Her fries were cold too. The services took a while so when the server walked by and we flagged her down to tell her we just didn't want it. They did take it off the bill which we really appreciated. The drinks were all good and the green chili stew was good. However, the egg over top had sat for too long and was no longer runny. Also, we had to ask for 2 of the 7 meals. Our server did the best to make up for it. The Italian salad was really good. I just must be old because it was hard to hear each other and see out on the patio. Again I really wanted to like it and since the food that came warm and correctly was really good. I would still recommend it."}
{"text":"Great...food...cold brews...and entertaining and attentive staff...what else can you ask for...enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We are long time fans of this restaurant that comes from Scottsdale AZ & were stoked to find that they opened one in our hometown... we did a few test runs when it first opened & found it not of the same standards, however its been a year since we dined there because of that (plus the fact that this is definitely only cheat meal food but SO good), but this time, the food was perfect! Just how it is in AZ. The hostess was not at her post & we waited a little bit, once we were seated the waiter was really quick to get our drinks & order our food. Apps came in a snap! MUST order the pretzel bread & homemade chips & dip....and even if you're chickened out, you HAVE to order the fried chicken! TO DIE FOR! ITs amazing. All in all, fantastic & happy we came back."}
{"text":"Let me walk u through the Culinary Dropout experience from some first timers.  First it is a Sunday night....

We walk in and are told about 20 minute wait...not bad.  They text u when the table is ready, which I loved.  Once we sat this is when everything is downhill.  The server was obviously extremely overwhelmed and busy.  We are understanding people,  so we waited.  First he comes over and says \"I'll just get everyone waters\"....well ok then, guess water it is.  He eventually came back...got our drink order and then off he goes.  We did stop him to order apps...which is a whole story.  After waiting 40 minutes and the people who sat after us got their apps we decided to ask.  Mind you at this time we already have ordered our food.  He forgot the  apps....great!! 4 hungry adults and a starving kid...no food 40 minutes in.  Finally food shows up after complaining about it.  The pretzel fondue was delicious.  The chips and famous onion dip were ok.  But the star was the deviled eggs with prosciutto were a show stopper!!!  Amazing!! I will come back just for those little babies!

1 hour and 7 minutes...FOOD comes!!!  Hmmm...majority was good.  I personally got the turkey pastrami....this burger has a identity crisis.  Majority of pastrami sandwhiches I have had are hot.  This came out with melted cheese on top and looked delicious.  Took one bite and ice cold in the middle.  Seriously ice cold!  Ask the server if it's a hot or cold sandwhich, his response \"half hot and half cold\"  Are you kidding me?!?!?!  At this point I am annoyed!  Husband ordered fish and chips.  Fish was awesome!! Everyone else ordered burgers and there were no complaints.  Overall the food was decent...but service was miserable. The guy tried...but was a epic fail at the end.  Overall the dinner trip was over a hour and a half....not sure that's worth it...."}
{"text":"I came here last week and had a bad experience, but Haley (one of the managers) reached out to me and brought me back in. I was so happy that she did. The experience I had must have been a one-off because it felt like night and day. I brought my husband with me and we arrived a little early for our reservation, but they were happy to accomodate us. We are big sports fans and the seating arrangement is great so that everyone can see the TVs with multiple games on no matter where you sit. 

I recommend the pretzels and cheese as your appetizer, just don't fill up on those before you get a chance to have something from the antipasti menu. Our main course consisted of the fried chicken and the steak. Both were amazing! I'm usually the type to just order appetizers and not entrees, but I wouldn't recommend that here, because the entrees are so well crafted. 

Joel was our server and he was great! He made the best recommendations and he knew what he was talking about. When you asked him for a suggestion he wouldn't just make a suggestion, he would give you details about why he thought things would pair well and he gave a preview of what to expect.

A lot of managers and business owners have gotten tired if the phrase \"the customer is always right\" and I have gotten several defensive and rude comments back when I give anything less than a 4 star rating on yelp. However, Culinary Dropout appears to truly value their customer's experience and is invested in ensuring that not just their food,  but their brand is top quality."}
{"text":"We love this place!  We eat here often and find this to be an excellent version of a casual restaurant brought to you by the Fox family of restaurants.   Great menu, great service and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fun atmosphere, wonderful waitstaff. The valet parking is complimentary. There is even a large bike rack for all you cruisers out there in PHX. Love the games and live music. Only complaint is TURN DOWN THE MUSIC. I like to talk to the people I am out to eat with, and the music was ear splitting at times. I hope you can hear me over the music Fox Restaurants. My family will return soon to see if you got my message."}
{"text":"Great place, awesome service. After spending a business trip on the east coast encountering terrible wait staff and mediocre food, this place was a breath of fresh air.
We came in about an hour before closing looking for food (every restaurant's nightmare) on a Saturday. They sat us right away. Mike, our waiter, was extremely helpful. He was patient with us, answered our questions, made great recommendations, and was very friendly. Having to work a crowded place late on a Saturday night, not many people would be so nice. He even gave us a heads up to make our dessert order before the kitchen was closed. Another guy with an epic beard (sorry, didn't catch his name)who wasn't our waiter was just as helpful even though he didn't have to be. Most people would have said they would try to find our actual waiter. This guy stopped what he was doing to help and he was completely genuine (and patient with my friend's never ending questions). The food here is amazing also. I highly recommend the pretzel bites, the turkey pastrami, and my friend really liked his burger, too.

They have live music on Friday and Saturday and the band on the night we went was amazing, and very fitting for the atmosphere.

I hate to tell too many people about this gem, because I want to keep it my little secret. But there is a lot of buzz about this place and it deserves praise."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Really liked the cooling misters! Good Beers and great food! Awesome service too! They have Valet parking and the entrance is in the rear.  Relaxing casual atmosphere! Good place for a big group as well!  definitely a good place for a team dinner. 
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo(oooooo...) delicious!

I came with a pal and his 3-year old daughter. Clearly, this isn't a super child-friendly place, but everyone - our waitress, the other waiters and waitresses, the hostesses, and the kitchen staff - did everything within their power to accommodate the wee one...including making a chocolate milk from scratch.  Ridiculous, and it got applause from the kiddo!

Being at the pre-opening, we had the opportunity to try a lot of different things...like a gross amount of food.  I'm not exactly proud of how much I ate.

We started with the crusty bread and oil, prosciutto (a HUGE pile), another pork meat I can't recall, manchego and prairie breeze cheeses.  While eating them, I wondered why our server didn't tell us which meat was which...and then we noticed they are actually written on the plate paper liner.  Duh....

I had the \"healthy\" salmon entree, which was cooked to perfection and the farro, cooked apple and fennel side flavorful enough that I wouldn't immediate think it was super healthy.   My buddy wanted the Korean Ribeye Cap but it was not available (noted on the menu that it has extremely limited availability), so he got the pork ribs instead.  It was a TON of food again, with a side of cole slaw that I ate.  For kids, we were given the option of grilled cheese sliders, burger sliders, mac n cheese, and chicken tenders, so slightly more options than I'd expect for a not-so-kid-friendly type of place.

My pal had the Bacon Bloody Mary and guzzled 2 of those.  I had only 1 cocktail - the Maria Pepino, which is basically a bloody mary with tequila instead of vodka, and garnished with a pickled pepper.  It was the perfect blend of savory tomato, spice, and acid.

The only \"misses\" for me was the iced tea (no one has plain iced tea anymore...no biggie, but please freaking tell me it's some nasty sweet shit) and the monkey bread, which was overly sweet and had a ton of apples that we picked around.

Our bill was an astronomical $110+ for lunch...which included 3 cocktails, a few appetizers, 3 entrees, and a dessert.  Would I be back for the whole she-bang?  Hell no...unless it's another gratis meal.  But will I be back for the sweet patio and a great cocktail and apps?  Most definitely!

FYI, the large patio space is deceiving...it is actually shared with the coffee shop and oyster bar (not yet open as far as I know), so I cannot imagine there will ever be a time without a large wait for group patio seating.

Lots of parking in the back.  Clean restrooms, but odd how they're set up... They are outside of the main restaurant portion, with separate doors for Men and Women.  But both doors take you to the communal sinks.  Why not just have one door to the restrooms?  

Our meal benefited Make A Wish Arizona - the founding Make A Wish chapter, if you didn't know!"}
{"text":"The food was unique and tasty, the waiters are chill! I liked the layed back, rock and roll (is grungy the right word??) style of the place. Really unique!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff everyone that approached our table was welcoming , Ann was amazing and definitely made our experience remorable. I got the jambalaya and Pistol at Dawn for my cocktail . I highly suggest it . No complaints here"}
{"text":"This place just exudes cool.  I wish I was 20, maybe 30 years younger as this is a hot spot.  Stage - live music, great food, and just alot of fun.  I aspire to play there one night and find at least one groupie that wants to hang with me!"}
{"text":"While it touts it is a new format, I would say it's a great copy of current format and it's done a good job putting the guest first. The food was high-quality and reasonably priced was a great selection of drinks and beverages"}
{"text":"Don't forget your ID!

I wish I could give a better review based on the food but we never got inside because a member of our party didn't have an ID so they refused to let us enter the building to have dinner. The bouncer was a total jerk with a lot of attitude.

We even called to ask about getting in with a minor and not having an ID and they told us it was fine. Unfortunately that info was wrong. They neglected to say the policy changes after 8."}
{"text":"Wonderful relaxed atmosphere at the Hard Rock with live music, outstanding service at the bar, excellent food and drink selections. Located next to pool area. Friendly staff and other customers and affordable menu. Great draft beer selection and burgers."}
{"text":"Came for brunch. The menu is pretty small but the food was pretty alright.  I had the breakfast burrito and it was quite filling. The coffee tasted really good, and the drinks were strong. I feel like this restaurant is doing brunch just for the sake of doing brunch; there's not a lot of thought behind the menu and morning drinks. I would do 3 stars but it gets a fourth because I live across the street and it's really convenient to get too."}
{"text":"Was excited to go here for my 21st birthday. It was a wednesday night and my dad called to make a reservation the lady said they don't take reservations unless there are six in the party. My dad explained to them we were celebrating a birthday and wanted to make sure we wouldn't have to waot long she said it would be no problem tonight maybe a five minute wait. We arrived explained that we called and what was going on and the lady said there would be a 45 minute wait. Great. I knew this was gonna happen. Your located in old town scottsdale you should take reservations for parties of four or more.  The girl behind the hostess stand acted like she couldn't arrange something so went and got what seemed to be the manager who tried to help us out. Over all the food was fine drinks were okay but not a place I would go again for a special occasion"}
{"text":"Super great find in Tempe!  Loved the vibe!  We went on a Friday night and the place was jumping.  We had the soft pretzels and provolone cheese fondue  and the BBQ Pork Belly Nachos!  Both were amazing!  We will definitely be returning!  Loved the food, loved the live music!  Great times!"}
{"text":"The place is impressive. That's what get's all most of the stars.

I'm not a fan of FRC food, but this time I had something half decent. And at a reasonable price, on top of it.

Meatloaf it is. The beet salad was OK too.

It's not cheap but at least I didn't leave disappointed as it usually happens to me at Sam Fox's restaurants. 

The service was barely OK and the valet parking was rude.

I'll go back once in a while but there're plenty of better options in the neighborhood (unless you want to be seen in a cool, overrated, overpriced, mediocre place, then this is your spot!)

Cheers"}
{"text":"The drinks and food were great. The pretzel and cheese fondue was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I moved from Arizona in August and I was happy to leave. I did not know that AZ was capable of a fun place to hang. I love the concept of the yard attached to the restaurant. You can play shuffle board, ping pong, corn hole, and/or chat. This place brings the outdoors inside."}
{"text":"Great venue, but we were here for drinks and apps and they had a acoustic band that was awesome!! Sin City Sinners. Why don't you let them play? This is suppose to be the hard rock hotel!! So turn it up later In the night and let the fun begin!! Missed opportunity in F&B sales. BAND WAS AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Let me start saying something, I'm not a big fan of the Fox restaurants. Nothing personal, just not impressed what so ever.

Than being said, let's start with the location. This location is awesome. Specially with the weather we had today.

Another positive point is the service. Friendly and professional.

The food is my main complaint, which is pretty serious if the review is about a restaurant.

We had the chips with the onion dip. This should be ordered by at least 4 people, they're good but super grease and the serving is way too much for 2 people (given the quantity of oil).

I had the tuna salad which was absolutely uneventful.

The kids burger was OK.

At least it wasn't extremely overpriced, otherwise I would take off another star. 

The location worth the visit, specially with great weather, but would't go for the food (at least what I tried).

BTW, the Arnold Palmer was pretty good.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Maybe it's the fact that my Company rented out the entire patio area and allowed all Corporate employees to go crazy with the company credit card!

Perhaps it's the fact that I had more drinks that night than I have fingers on both hands...

Could it be even that coupled with the 90+ temperatures that week, once I'd had my share of kamikaze' shots alongside Adioses', I was so \"faded, that I wanted to get X-rated\"???

I dunno!

Allz' I know (hiccup), is that the next time I'm in Phoenix, this place is DEFINITELY at the top of my \"To Do\" list!

Thanks for a great time guys!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and people watch! My friends and I went here for happy hour and ordered the pretzels with cheese fondue- really good! As far as the rest of the menu, it's a bit pricy. The indoor/ outdoor space is amazing though..."}
{"text":"Excellent service and fun atmosphere in the Tempe location.  Menu and portions are perfectly adequate."}
{"text":"This is the last time I will be ordering from this establishment--to which I am a regular patron. I called in a simple to go order with two items as well as a few side condiments, and was told that my wait was 20 minutes. I arrived at the estimated time and was told it was not ready, which is fine, I have worked in restaurants and know how it goes, but they didn't seem busy so I did not expect to wait long. Sure enough 5 minutes later I see my to go bag in the window yet it is being completely ignored by the staff. I assume it must not be complete, but it was two of the same item and sides so I didn't expect to wait much longer. After twenty minutes of frustrated waiting and zero attention from the staff I finally say something. I quickly grab my to go, which is completed, and head out as I am in a hurry. I find out soon enough that not only is my meal lacking quality (it is cold and much smaller than the usual portion) but it is missing my sides I explicitly requested. I return to the restaurant upset, and the bartender who took my order tells me to fix my attitude and calls me a \"stupid piece of sh*t.\" I am appalled at this establishments service and organization and certainly will be telling all of my family and friends to avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Unbelievably unreasonable business practice. They won't take reservations for a group over 12..... How does that make any sense? \"We will take your money if there are 12 of you, but we don't want the extra money from the other 8.\" Business must be so good that they just don't need loyal customers or groups.....

Won't be back."}
{"text":"I took my kids to lunch here, i started out with a bacon bloody mary , and Arnold Palmer's for the kids. We had their pretzel fondue, which was fabulous,  and had bacon burgers, and fries and everything was great! The waiter James was very attentive, as well as the manager on duty, James Lee. I would highly recommend this spot. It has a trendy decor, and really friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Saturday brunch was not that busy. Atmosphere is casual with nice views of the pool. Service was extremely slow (but friendly).....Even sitting at the bar. Ordered a breakfast burrito and grilled cheese sliders. Both were really good. Would rate 4-5 star on the food but the service made it 3"}
{"text":"Fun venue and inspired menu.  We loved the pierogi and ravioli dishes.  Great service. We'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Talk about yum! I LOVE THE BEET starter... don't be fooled by the pictures of pretzel bites (their good too) there are also healthy options! All of the salads are amazing and I like the hummus too! Yum yum yum, I look forward to coming again very soon!"}
{"text":"Everything I heard about this place is true. Excellent food, service and atmosphere. Will be back soon ;)"}
{"text":"Based on cocktails and apps. Drinks were well priced and unique. Apps were delicious and the atmosphere complemented everything. Great service and great recovery by the manager and server, Ashley. She knew our drinks took an unusually long time and discounted them because of the fact. Even the manager came by to recognize the delay. I am impressed by the service here. Well done."}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience at the Culinary! We had a group of five people and we were seated in the PDR.  The ambiance was lovely.  It was filled but not overly crowd and a band was playing very good music.  The order consisted of the fried chicken entree, which is to die for. This entree was shared by two people and the staff separate it and plated for two people without being asked.   We also had the nachos and wings with a side salad.  The food was hot and delish!  The chips in the nachos did not get soft or soggy.  They maintained their crispiness.  The wings had a slaw on top which was very tasty.  A big shout out to our waitress, Lorna.  The service is fabulous and the overall feel of the restaurant atmosphere is great. The GM came over and checked on us.  I saw him greet customers and also clean up tables.  The staff was very welcoming.  I plan to stop by on their happy hour to try it out."}
{"text":"A really fun place with great atmosphere & great fried chicken! Plus ping pong & corn-hole.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"My friend that lives in Denver came to Phoenix for the day and she wanted to try this place. Well, as I have never been here,we were off. Easy to find, right on 7th. But, you have to enter through the back parking lot. No entrance on the front or the sides. 
Big parking lot but, I can see where it would fill up fast. This place is absolutely huge inside. We choose to sit outside as it is finally cool enough to sit outside now.
There was a beautiful huge Patio with massive tables and spaces everywhere. We had just missed the lunch rush so it was really good.
The menu is on the small side. But, that is what Gordon Ramsey always says, Do just a few things but, do them really well.
I have to admit that everything we got was really good! I mean actually excellent.
I was driving so I only had water. My friend had a glass of wine.
I got the fish and chips with Cole slaw. The fries were incredible. I do not know what they fry them in.  But, whatever it is it works. Both of us thought the same thing. I had to ask what the fish was, as it was firm and flavorful.        Our server said that it was Rock Fish. Rock on because, it was great.
Julie Ordered a Burger with bacon. Not my cup of Tea. But, she thought it was great and ate every last bite. Giving it wonderful praise. 
I think we came at a really good time of day. Because, it was not busy and it was peaceful outside. I had not heard great things about this place. However, we thought it was amazing. They only have one type of soup though. But, our server too was also really grand.
Very much worth a try if you have not gone before."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great find for us on our recent vacation to Scottsdale, AZ.  We were headed to a matinee showing of the Dark Knight Rises movie at Fashion Square Mall, so we looked around for a place to grab lunch in the area.  

We picked Culinary Dropout because we liked the witty name.  We had no idea how great this would be.

We started off with some of their signature drinks and a bowl of their pretzel bites and cheese fondue.  It was fabulous!  We had to order an extra bowl of pretzel bites because they were so good.  Then came the main course...  

I asked the waiter for some recommendations of their \"specialty items\", and he pointed me to their fried chicken with mashed potatoes, biscuits and honey drizzle (over all of it).  I was hesitant to order that for lunch because it was the middle of the day, and I didn't want to be too full for the movie.  However, another waiter said I would \"love it\" so I took the plunge.  And am I glad I did!

The crust on the chicken was so brown and crispy and the honey glaze gave it a hint of sweetness.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and wonderful as they were topped with cream gravy.  And last but not least were the fluffy and light biscuits.  Having grown up in the South, I've had some good meals of fried chicken, biscuits and mashed potatoes, and I would put this one right up at the top.  I didn't eat all 3 pieces of chicken, but what I did have was amazing!

Finally, the women ordered a caramel popcorn & pudding dessert that was totally different than anything I had eaten before, but it was just as wonderful as everything else we ate that day.

If you have a chance to check out Culinary Dropout, I would highly recommend you do so.  They even have live music to boot (although not while we were there)."}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour during a staycation at the Hard Rock. At first, I had my doubts, because it looked a little too \"hipserty.\" But my doubts were put to rest by our great waitress and the tasty food and drinks she delivered.

We each had a couple of the $3 mug beers. What a great deal! This wasn't PBR or its ilk; these were actual IPAs and pale ales! And although we split only two small appetizers, they were great values as well -- and one was pretty outstanding. The homemade potato chips and onion dip were a retro take on the classic snack. Fine enough, and well worth the happy hour price ($3). But the smoked salmon bruschetta ($6) was fantastic! Reminded me of the smoked fish dip at Ted Peters in St. Pete's, FL. We could have eaten that all day. It doesn't look like it's on the regular menu, so if you want this little slice of heaven, you'll have to hit happy hour. But why wouldn't you? The regular menu prices seemed a bit high ($22 fried chicken, anyone?), but these really felt like a steal.

We used to go to the Pink Taco for happy hour on a fairly regular basis, but I think I've found a new favorite. I hope to be dropping in on the Dropout soon!"}
{"text":"Jade rocks! Great customer service,  engaging,  attentive. Makes experience even better.  Food always good."}
{"text":"Great place, good food and fun atmosphere but the wait staff is eager to up-charge your bill so make sure you ask about prices.  We went for dinner and the waiter was eager to suggest drinks and appetizers that were on the higher end and when I asked for salmon on my salad I didn't find out until the bill came that the roasted salmon was $8 instead of the $5 as the menu stated.  When we asked he said that the smoked salmon was $5 not the roasted but he didn't bother to tell me that when I ordered.  He also pushed a dessert, the bourbon pie that was very lame.  Just question everything they suggest."}
{"text":"I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this place! I'm not from the area and we have nothing like this in my city! 

The atmosphere was great and the people were fun. The servers were excellent! I enjoyed it so much I went twice during my stay in Phoenix! 

I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I had the fried chicken with honey drizzle. It comes with a biscuit and coleslaw but you can also substitute another side. The chicken skin is fried hard with honey drizzle and it's absolutely delicious. Would definitely recommend this place. Next time we'll try dessert."}
{"text":"This is a very fun and yummy place to eat and drink. If you want some entertainment, especially for the kids they have many games to play. Our waitress was also super sweet, happy, and nice even though she was working on the 4th!"}
{"text":"Never ever buy the steak, total waste of money. I've been to the other location several times before have always been a fan of Fox restaurants and love the atmosphere in general. However, went last night to this location and was feeling like a steak. Ordered it and got maybe 2oz of steak covered in a Tom of French fries. The steak tasted good but for $25 bucks the portion was ridiculous and basically just $25 for French fries. I've had other things at the other location where the portions were normal but really disappointed this time. My date ordered the rainbow trout and it ended up having several small bones left in it, I understand sometimes smaller parts of the bone in the skin, but overall not a great experience for us this time. Extremely disappointed!

UPDATE: After getting contacted by the management (Alyssa the GM and Haley the AGM) my date and I went back and had the best customer service and the food was on point! Very pleased with the customer service and food was incredible. Must have caught the chef on an off moment or something the first time but very very glad I went back. Special kudos to the management for being so welcoming and excellent communication."}
{"text":"The food here is not the best, I'm not crazy about it. However, they have a really great Moscow mule and it's the perfect spot to take cool instagrams, or play some games. So if you're not into eating, then this is the spot to be!"}
{"text":"I live in Chandler, but I make a point to come to this place at least once a month.   Been coming here for over two years and the food is awesome...the turkey and slaw on a pretzel roll is what I order the most, had the ribs yesterday and they were amazing.  I will have to say their cocktail list is one of the best I've seen, and the \"After School Special\" is the reason I come back so often.  The other cocktails look awesome, but after one or two of the After School Special, I am in the best mood ever so I usually don't change it up.  The service has always been great, but after meeting one of the lady managers and their recently promoted, extremely personable barback...their service has only gotten better and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good food and great casual dining and, yes, it is a great space like everyone says. The service was a little slow when we were there but the place was packed. Food was surprisingly good for the incredible volume they manage."}
{"text":"Pretty solid. I would go back.  Pretzels and cheese,  same as everywhere that serves them.  Sirloin was good"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner date on a Friday.

We got seated fairly quickly, and got servers drinks quickly. We ordered the salmon bruschetta with fried chicken entree. The salmon bruschetta was really good, and the friend chicken was on point.

I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"It was super crowded for a Wednesday, with a good mix of college age, young professionals and families. We ate at the bar and had good service. We ordered the pretzels, since we saw them pass by, but ours seemed to be over cooked since they were very dark and not golden like the ones we saw. The cheese fondue made up for it."}
{"text":"I came here alone and sat at the bar. The gentlemen behind the bar were quick and extremely kind! Almost to the point where I couldn't look them in the eye. I ordered a subpar glass of wine.. should of ordered a cocktail. They looked amazing! I got prosciutto and manchego with bread to start. Perfect start! I then ordered the butternut squash cannelloni (seasonal) and my expectations were exceeded! Definitely would recommend to a friend and can only hope I can get back to this beautiful city and restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The Pub Burger is awesome!!   Try the Smashed Irishman it was spectacular."}
{"text":"So Fun....... And the food is delicious too.

I was here with my coworkers and was so impressed with the food and atmosphere.  The food was average priced for vegas.  I had the Tuna Salad and my only issue was the fishy taste of the tuna.  The salad portion was excellent and the pretzel bites were awesome!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has the reviews it does. The majority of the items we ordered ranged from bad to mediocre at best. The only item that we ordered that was good was the turkey pastrami, which to be fair, was quite good. The soft pretzels and fondue which are a house speciality were fairly awful. The fondue was more of a congealed cheese wiz, not a fondue and the restaurant should have been ashamed to serve it as it was inedible. The service was also lack luster.  The waitress was no where to be found the majority of our meal. While the turkey pastrami was good, I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place for an after work wind down. Awesome atmosphere as well as delicious food and drinks. Their Happy Hour is the BEST! Thanks Lizza B"}
{"text":"Great concept, great atmosphere & menu!  Only downside ~ the valet parking company they use ~ during a recent visit for an early dinner, I discovered the following day that money, iPhone charger, etc. had been taken from a CLOSED compartment in the car ~ when I called the valet company, they were unresponsive ~ like many others, I valet park quite frequently, and this reflects poorly on the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times now, and it's always an all around great experience. I love the decor, the fabulous chandeliers, the oversized chairs that make me feel like Alice in Wonderland in the tea party scene. But what I love the most is the food. Oh the glorious, tasty, want it in mah' belly-right-now food! Doesn't matter what you order, it's gonna be good.
So far, my favorite place for dinner in the area.
Tip- try the caramel custard desert
Tip- pretzel bun turkey pastrami
Tip- fried chicken n biscuits
Tip- Acai mojito

That is all"}
{"text":"Great pretzel fondue!!! The drinks were great and so was the rest of the meal. The server was very nice and personable. Great place to stop in and eat alone."}
{"text":"Great as pub, but not so much as restaurant, especially at Friday night. One hour for us to find a high table(first come first serve), then half an hour later I received SMS from host tell me a normal table is ready...

Very energetic place in a big warehouse, loud music, young college kids, can't complain about that. But I am not too impress with the food. Soft Pretzels with Fondue tastes reasonable good, though a little too plain. Fried chicken is pretty good, juicy and tasty, though still not something that can be rated as outstanding. I understand it's a place more for atmosphere, so definitely not a bad choice in Tempe, but the food is not worth the waiting time anyway.

It would be better if you want to have a party and play here of course."}
{"text":"had some tasty tasy brussls at the bar while a group of English girls wearing too much purfume were refused drinks because they didnt have IDs. The brussels were delicious and maybe had some kind of kimchee like funk and kick to them (this is a good thing) and the bartender refused them so politely it made me giddy as they insisted they were an eligible age.

Had the ribeye cap for dinner and those littles hrooms were the best part. All in all I apparently went to a korean restaurant for dinner and did not regret it."}
{"text":"Nice place to hangout with friends with a big open space. I had the turkey pastrami, would not recommend if you're looking for something fantastic."}
{"text":"First time there, and the fried chicken was one of the best I have had.  The sides of mashed potatoes and gravy, with biscuits, were less than stellar, however.  Nevertheless, the staff was friendly, and the chicken was great."}
{"text":"This is definitely the See-and-Be-Seen place in that Scottsdale corridor!   I usually opt for sitting outside as I'm easily entertained with what's going on out there.  Lots of eye candy for both sexes here!

One thing you will notice right away is their huge drink list on the right hand side of the menu.  There are some really cool things to drink at CD and my personal favorite is the Ginger Margarita (El Matador) - Yum!!!  They also have an awesome wine and beer selection there on the back of the menu too.  I'm always so torn with \"Do I have a great glass of wine or one of these yummy cocktails???\"  Well the cocktail always wins out here!

For appetizer, you MUST get the Pretzel Bread with the cheese fondue.  They bring out fresh, warm pretzel bread nuggets that you dip in a yummy cheese fondue sauce.  It is to die for and I get cravings for this every once in a while.  Tough to schlep over there for a craving when you live up by Desert Ridge!  I've also had the Mussels appie as well as the homemade potato chips and both were really very delish.

Hubby and I have also done the Charcuterie and Cheese on the left in past visits and all were really wonderful with one of their nice glasses of red wines.

For entree's, there is really nothing that can go wrong here.  It just depends what you're in the mood for.  The fried chicken is BOMB, the Pork Belly Cubano is delicious and the French Dip is one of my go to favorites.  

This isn't a cheap place - i had the pretzel bread, the mussels and the margarita and it cost me $30 before tip.  I was my own expensive date!"}
{"text":"Great vibe good food and perfect location to chill. Must go! We were on a girls trip and happened on this place from a recommendation from a local patron. We had a great time people watching, eating amazing food, and drinking incredible wine all the way up to closing time.
Will go any day - any time of day - and any time."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  I ordered the kobe steak and it was amazing.  My date ordered the grilled cheese and he said it was just okay.  The drinks were small and didn't really taste good, so the 5 stars are for the ambiance and food!"}
{"text":"Had six orders of the prosciutto deviled eggs with my #plymouthgin #roomservice cocktail and rib cap. The Thai chicken wings are also on point. But the absolute star above the amazing food and incredible drinks. Gina. Let me tell you a short story about Gina, I own a bar, and I would hire as many Ginas as I could find. We were in town for #Ellismania, threw in the #MagicMikeLive show. But the six of us stopped by CDO before the #ellismania show, and Gina stole the main event of the night. Thank you Gina, five days at the #Hardrocklv and you were the star. Four out of Six of us are in the industry and were very impressed."}
{"text":"Gina was the best server! During my stay at HR I was here twice. I loved the ambiance, the bloody marys, comfy seating, delicious food and wide variety of choices on menu. Would recommend coming here for casual and flavorful meal with great atmosphere."}
{"text":"excellent service except the drinks were slow(surprising since this is the most lucrative profit point in the business)but couldn't blame the waitress for that.They were out of the green Chile stew but the 2nd choices were great.The chopped salad was more meat and cheese than salad and of course I loved it.Wife had the turkey pastrami which was white meat  and seasoned perfectly.All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had the Pretzel Bun Sandwich with fries and a couple of IPA's. the food was GREAT! I came by to only get a quick bite, but it ended up being the best meal I had by far while i was in Vegas. The view is great of the pool area, with outdoor seating.

4 stars because the service was just... ok.."}
{"text":"One of our family favorites! We do brunch here and on a nice day, you can sit outside close to the pool. It's fun to people watch. We love the atmosphere and the hip staff.

The soft pretzels with fondue are a must as I'm sure you have read from other reviews. Everytime we are here, we order it right away. Crap it's good. Anything on the menu is good. I like the egg white frittata and my kid likes the Cap'n Crunch French toast with Fresh raspberries. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. If you have questions, the servers are great to offer suggestions.

We have also done Easter Brunch here a couple times and then head to the Bellagio conservatory right after. 

It's a great location at the Hard Rock off the strip. You don't have to deal with the chaos the Strip has to offer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to take visitors.  The pretzels and potato chips are amazing. Sit outside if it's warm out.   Only reason it's not 5 starts is because they got rid of the beef stroganoff.   By far the best thing on the menu and they got rid of it!!!! Bring it back please!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome service. And our waiter Ben was very outgoing and personable, made our night outstanding!!!!Thanks Ben for GREAT Service!"}
{"text":"Went here late night with some buddies for some grub during a Bachelor party!  Food is great, atmosphere was great, music was great.. overall a very good time!"}
{"text":"Really cool place!! The Yard is a pretty cool and fun concept.  The drink specials were actually pretty fun. $3 for a beer in a brown paper bag.  It could either be \"Old Milwaukee's Best\" or something good like \"Fat Tire\".  The main printer ran out of paper and the tickets were printing off somewhere else and nobody noticed for awhile.  It took us over an hour to get our food. Hey, that stuff happens, but when it does do something for the customer.  Me and my buddy make our living in the food service industry so we are pretty easy going about stuff especially when it was one of those things.  Just because we didn't kick up a storm doesn't mean you should save the free round of drink for the ones who do.  They staff was great, the concept was cool, and the food was good, but not doing something for your guest when you mess up is preventing me from giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"First things first: pork belly toast with the sriracha aioli is something I wish I could begin and end every day with. I came in on Tuesday night at around 7:30 with a party of 12 and our server (forgot to ask his name sadly) was off the bat super flexible when we asked to add another high 4-top to our now party of 14-15 and overall extremely accommodating, funny, and friendly. As someone who works in the service industry I understand the stresses that come with large parties, but he handled it very well. Our table shared the roasted Brussels sprouts, prosciutto deviled eggs (worth killing over), soft pretzels & provolone fondue (wish pretzels were a little more salted), ma...the meatloaf?!, shrimp & pork belly ramen (can't you tell I love pork belly?), prime rib dip, and some other stuff I can't remember the name of. Overall, loved the cool fusion of foods going on and how well they maintained an abundance of flavors in all their dishes. Especially thought it was cool my ramen came with chopsticks, that's how you know this place is legit! And one last shout out to our cool ass server"}
{"text":"So, I'm staying at the hard rock for a few days and I saw the reviews on this place so I decided to try it... Well it was only just okay, the restaurant itself is really nice it gives off an eclectic vibe. Our waitress (her name is ray) she was awesome, she was extremely attentive, super friendly and did her job well! On to the food... I had the famous fried chicken (well I'm from the south) and this isn't anything to write home about it was dry and tasteless. My husband had the grill chicken sandwich and said it was decent. The drinks (I can't remember the names) but mine was some type of apple with rum and beer it was awful I took two sips and could not finish it. I gave them 3 stars because the server was great the place is nice but the food needs work!"}
{"text":"Cool, laid back, casual yet hipster without trying.  Industrial exposed piping and fixtures intertwined with chandeliers and it works to create amazing decor. 

We made reservations for Saturday brunch. Staff was very courteous and friendly.  It took longer than you'd expect to place our drink order & get them, as well as cash out and they werent busy. The atmosphere is very casual so that could be why. 

Food prices are more than fair, especially for Vegas. Bacon Bloody Mary was good but way too expensive for the size. ($13 for a glass half the size of a normal bloody mary). 

As far as the food goes, it was good but everything had a twist of unusualness to it. The biscuits and gravy are not made the traditional way you'd expect. They were good but very different from any I've ever had. The Cap't Crunch French Toast & monkey bread were great!! 

I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was here over Memorial Weekend with my friend. We waited 10 minutes and got a great table outside.
Our server was so friendly and helped up with suggestions. We probably ordered to much, but some how we did manage to eat it all.
I highly recommend their burrata. It was the 2nd best I've ever had. And we had 2 different meats & the olives. The serving sizes on the meats was very generous given the price. the olives were delish too.
Give this place a try if you haven't yet. Also, the decor is really cool."}
{"text":"I've gone to other Fox Restaurant Concepts in Tucson-Wildflower (love), Zinburger (okay), Zin Bistro (loved, and then they closed it and made it into Zinburger, boo), and have heard Sauce, Blanco, and North are good. I ordered the pretzel and fondue I've heard a ton about and it was good; but not as good as I was expecting it to be after hearing all the compliments about it. I also had the fried chicken (which our server said was one of their best selling entrees), and it was also good, but I've been spoiled with excellent homemade fried chicken (that tops this one easily). The buttermilk biscuit was a bit too salty for my taste. My sister had the ribs- which were very meaty- but the sauce was lacking- it said jalapeno and molasses in the sauce-and all we really tasted was ketchup. I had the acai mojito which was tasty. 

The restaurant and patio are beautiful, the whole area is. Also if you're one that doesn't like louder restaurants-I'd say to sit outside-inside was too loud-I couldn't hear my tablemates too well. Our server was good and paid us the perfect amount of attention- props to her and her service! Overall I'd say Culinary Dropout was good- but not somewhere I'd probably come again if I was just in Phoenix for the day."}
{"text":"Not too busy, it has a picture worthy view.  We went after noon for lunch.  It was early so it was bright and inviting sitting by the window.  I've never been there late to witness if it's noisy or dark as I've read in the reviews was an issue.  

On the drink menu they had bourbon & vodka mules, like a the 'Classic Dropout Mule' is a Moscow Mule, etc.  I asked if they could make my favorite mule a Dark 'N Stormy, basically like a Moscow Mule, but with rum.  Well, it tasted like a sour margarita and rumless.  My friend got a margarita that tasted like the sour mix mostly.  Instead, I was happy that they had Veuve Clicquot by the glass. And even that was flat.  I didn't complain.  

We didn't try the most talked about Pretzel Fondue, but I love Pretzel bread!  I always order a 'dijonaise' over cheese when I eat pretzel bread.  I ordered the Turkey Pastrami on pretzel bread with cole slaw and Swiss.  My friend Jeff C. ordered the Grilled Chicken Club.

Overall, not impressive.  I did like the chewy pretzel bread, but it wasn't the best.  We split sandwiches and I'd have to say his Club was better.  Nothing that I would rush back to try again and not even the service.  I am not sure if the menu is different at night or on the weekends.  I don't frequent Hard Rock anymore so wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"First of all the look of this restaurant is the cutest thing! The atmosphere is so fun! Everything is cooked fresh here daily. The nachos are beyond bomb! The cheese is provolone fondue... WHAT?! Insane! The service is great and really nice. If you want to try something new definitely go!"}
{"text":"First experience.  Happy Hour food was pretty good, although the chopped salad was not what we were told it was going to be.  Smoked salmon bruschetta very tasty.  Drinks just fair. Would question the 12 oz claim on HH beer."}
{"text":"Got the fried chicken dinner, about $20 after tax and tip.

The gravy was VERY salty, as was the crust of the chicken.  I could handle it but I can imagine many could not.  The chicken was very juicy, though the two dark meat pieces were the best.  The crust was a little too oily and soggy on the bottom, and thinner than I prefer.  The mashed potatoes were very whipped and smooth, and I would've preferred more lumps.

They did not have any misters on over the outside seating which made it quite uncomfortable outside.  I also found the music too loud, which made conversation very difficult.

This Yard location does have much better parking than the Phoenix one, but you are forced to walk across a vast swath of roped off valet only spots to self-park."}
{"text":"The pretzel rolls should of been softer. They tasted like the ones you heat up at home in the microwave. I had the bacon Bloody Mary. I don't recommend that either. For a $10 Mary I expected a smooth taste with a pow. No pow! 
It took 40 minutes to get our entrees at lunch time. They weren't even packed. I sent my food back as I had lost my appetite after the drink and bad app.
The manager offered to make it right I told him not to worry it just took forever.
He still charged us for everything! Not even comping my bad mary!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was just ok to me. With little options because we were in a one crunch we dropped in here because of the good reviews and location. My kale salad was just ok and pretty dang salty... I love my salt normally! The oysters were good as well as the cheese."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service & great food & great atmosphere! I love when they have live entertainment."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a hip fun place to find amazing cocktails and food, this is it!   The decor is comfortable yet trendy.  The staff is way hipster. The patrons range from young to older, nice mix of people there at all times!  Excellent food! Incredible mixologists!  Doesn't hurt that the staff is super friendly and there is zero atitude here! Price can't be beat.!  Fox Group you have certainly done it again!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't sit at the bar if you want to order     food. 

-Appetizer came with my food.
- Wasn't checked on once
-utensils were dirty 

By the time I got a new set of fork and knife and finished my appetizer, my fried chicken was cold. 

Didn't even bother tasting it, paid for my meal, left a 30% tip and walked out. 

With such poor service, they'll need the cash more than me"}
{"text":"Excellent food & amazing atmosphere!! You can't tell by the front of the restaurant (inside Hard Rock) that this is a hidden gem! Restaurant has equal parts inside and outside dining area with outside seating more of a lounge feel with couches, high back chairs and fire pits. They have a live cover band playing while u dine as well. Menu is diverse as they have everything from deviled eggs, to ramen bowls to fish and chips. Would definitely recommend and/or come here again."}
{"text":"Very good food, no complaints there. The pretzels are amazing, the mussel portion is quite large, and all the other appetizers were the same. The menu has a variety of different items so there is something for everyone. The prices were a tad higher than what it is worth and some of the waitresses seemed to have misplaced their clothes, but apart from that it was great."}
{"text":"I tried culinary dropout recently I love the atmosphere and open kitchen. I tried the pork belly nachos, pierogis and pretzels with fondue. The pick and guac tasted fresh and added so much extra flavor to the plate. The nachos came out first but the pork was cold. The pierogis were delicious and different because they had Brussels sprouts in them. The pretzels were absolutely delicious. 
I did four stars because everything was good and I would go back if I was in the area but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Came in with reserved seating, waitress was dressed very well and hip to the environment. Ordered drinks very fast, received very fast! Ordered appetizers, received them very fast. Ordered the pretzels with cheese. They forgot our Frideviled eggs and immediately compd it. Above and beyond A+++++"}
{"text":"My GAWD, is this little chain OVERRATED and way overpriced! It's essentially just another sports bar with a clever name and relentless PR suggesting they are the new holy grail of comfort food. No way! For what I paid for a skimpy roast beef (They call it prime rib!) au jus sandwich, I could have had THREE at any diner or even Jersey Mike's subs! It tasted fine, but there is absolutely nothing special or creative about the food here. I'm sure millennials get off on the huge cavernous dining room with the dramatic high ceiling, and the spooky trek through the dark hallway to get to the dining room, but so what?! All the publicity that drew me to this place only to feel cheated reminded me of when I finally made the trek to \"Matt's Big Breakfast,\" another classic Phoenix ripoff sold to the public with hipster puffery."}
{"text":"Nice to find a friendly atmosphere in the Hard-Rock. Full of smiles and hellos from the staff. They even hooked us up with breakfast burritos even though they don't usually serve them on weekdays. Joseph our server was awesome. Thanks again I will be back when we come to Hard Rock"}
{"text":"I was here back in December 2015, and I remember wanting to write this review, but not being able to remember for the life of me what this place was called... and then I totally forgot about it. 

Well, today, I was cleaning out my purse and came across the receipt with the server's name on it - RaeAnne. Or maybe that was the cashier? I had the loveliest waitress from Chicago, and when I came across the receipt, I remembered her and my experience here and I smiled. 

I was pretty hungover and on my own, and I ordered the pulled pork nachos. They were AWESOME! Perfect hangover food. Really great, trendy \"fresh mex\" nachos. I had a mediocre coffee too. But all coffee in America was mediocre to bad, so I can't hold it against this place. There was hardly anybody else in the place at the time - it was about 3pm. 

My waitress sat with me and talked about Vegas and life and she was so nice and so warm and down to earth, that 6 months later, I looked at my receipt and felt all warm and fuzzy remembering that grey afternoon. A+ experience here, all the way.

It's an ultra chic and trendy, very large restaurant inside the Hard Rock Hotel (where I was staying). Apparently they do a great bloody mary and other cocktails, and have one of those menus with things like burgers, nachos and other more varied items... its an upmarket  \"something for everyone\" spot."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hard Rock and came here for dinner one night. It's a hip gastropub that is well decorated with decent food. Here's the rundown: 

atmosphere: ***** 5 stars!!! very chic, cute, great vibe
service: eh, it was alright. Friendly, but not attentive
roasted tomato appetizer: DELICIOUS! I could eat this all day
olives: the big green ones were good but the small ones were bitter. and of course you get more of the small ones
fried chicken dinner: this was pretty good. The chicken was extremely moist, mashed potatoes were yummy and coleslaw was well made. Biscuits were to die for. 
beef stroganoff: this was alright. the flavors were good but I thought the pasta would be thicker and chewier (more al dente). They claim it's hand made so I had high expectations. It was thin and blah. 
pretzel and fondue dip: LOOKS good in pictures, but it wasn't very exciting at all. The pretzels did not taste fresh and the cheese dip isn't any better than the liquid cheese you get elsewhere. 

Get the fried chicken!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great! It is a bit loud but I did not mind personally. It is expected with so many people. I got the Perogies and my boyfriend got ribs, while we shared pretzel bites with fondue. We have leftovers for sure! The pretzel bites are several bites and quite large in all honesty, could be a meal because it is bread and cheese. The ribs were delicious. Very wet and love. The perogies were very good along with the califlower and brusselnsprouts that came. It was a small meal though. More of a appetizer than the bites. I was okay with it however. The lights, decorations and management were great. Everyone is very friendly and dressed stylishly. There are not only tables but couches to sit on instead on booths or tables. I am only 19 however the 21+ area looked very fun with ping pong and the game where you toss bags into holes (sorry I forgot the name.) reason for 5 stars is that I just never give them..... whoops"}
{"text":"I had the meatloaf sandwich at Happy Hour and was not impressed.  It was actually pretty awful.  The games can be fun, and the outside patio \"Yard\" area was spacious.  I managed to pop in here when valet wasn't mandatory, so I didn't have to deal with that headache.

I'd give them another shot though, so I'll probably be back some time in the future."}
{"text":"Funky/ modern decor. A nice hip new spot in Scottsdale. I'm in town visiting from San Diego and wanted to check out a new spot to eat so we checked out reviews and chose this spot. The food was so great! We shared the pretzels and fondue and I had the ribs both were 2 of the most popular dishes. Extremely flavorful. Love the ambiance and the food."}
{"text":"Way too loud, however the food was very good. Additionally, I  don't like being practically forced to valet my automobile. I would like to give this place another chance but it definitely won't be on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Ate here for our daughter's 21st birthday and had a wonderful experience! From the service to the food, everything was amazing. It is not exaggerating to say this is now my favorite place to eat.

We had the fried chicken, French dip and pork ribs. All were very good. 

The ambiance is very cool. I only wish we had been there on a night when there was live music."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best drinks, the atmosphere is so fun and the food is great! I always take my family here while they're in town to visit and they love all the games! Definitely a go to stop for a low key, fun night out!"}
{"text":"Came to this place twice once at night, once for lunch not a line either time or a wait for seating. Place was very clean. Staff was friendly even servers who were not your own were very helpful. 
 Menu is average size. Lots of good options that are not too fancy and not to boring. Appetizers and entrees are fairly priced. I tried the kale salad and the grilled cheese sliders both were delicious and had the perfect amount of ingredients. One downfall is no nutrition facts for you calorie counters etc.
 Overall would recommend for a nice sit down casual inside the hard rock!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this spot! From the minute we got there there was great people-watching, a really cool atmosphere, great service, and incredible food. 

I had the Room Service cocktail (so good I had two) and my group of three split the grilled cheese sliders, squash salad, and soft pretzels. 

I can't pick which food item was my favorite because each one was so great. The pretzels really surprised me because they were so good, but I had pretty low expectations. 

Really enjoyed my visit and definitely if you're with a group get a bunch of items to share."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is one of my favorite restaurants in my \"rotation\" when I'm in Phoenix.  I don't live in Phoenix, so I have to be pretty picky about hitting the best restaurants when I'm there.  Culinary Dropout is one of those.

There's many locations--as I work for an airline, this is the one that I typically eat at.  (Years ago, visiting Phoenix for friends, I first went to Culinary Dropout up in Scottsdale, which I think was their original location.)  It's pretty close to the airport, and many of the hotel airport shuttles where I stay will bring you to this location free of charge.

The locations ultimately have the same vibe, so like the other location that I've been to, there's definitely a hip / indie / kinda hipster feel about this one.  Weird / nifty light fixtures, cool decor on the walls, and kind of a southern / American / new type decor graces the premesis.  As you walk to the restroom, you can take a glimpse into the kitchen, and the bathrooms are nice and pretty unique.  Men, you can see into the ladies restroom, and they can see into your restroom--but only above the sinks.  It kind of freaks you out the first time you see it...  it's kind of weird and kind of cool at the same time.

But enough of the environmental crap--let's get to the meat and potatoes...  literally. I've eaten here many a time, and the food and drinks are off the hook.

I recommend their \"signature\" old fashioned.  (They may have some kind of a cute name for it, as it has a bit of a modern spin on the traditional beverage.). Mmmmm.  Tasty.  

It's hard to pick stand out dishes on the menu as they're all so good.  The pretzel fondue has been mentioned before, and with good reason--it's friggin' amazing.  I think I get it every time I come here.  Dee-licious...  enough said.  

For your mains, the turkey pastrami and fried chicken here are both delicious and memorable.  I've also had and loved the grilled cheese sliders, and those are better if you want something a bit lighter than some of the other entrees.  

But really, based on my experience, you can't go wrong with Culinary Dropout.  The only negative thing that I can say about them is that sometimes it can be slow to be seated here, and parking can be kind of a pain.  (At least you don't feel like you have to valet...  they provide both options during peak hours.) I have had slow service before, but this generally doesn't bother me so much.  If you're in a hurry, it may not be the best place to go...  and if you are in a hurry and decide to brave it, just let them know that you're trying to eat quickly and they'll probably accommodate you.

Also--they're not great about calling your name when you're waiting for a table.  If you feel like you're waiting longer than the quoted time, check in with the host stand...  chances are you didn't hear them call your name.

All in all, great place, and on my short list of places to eat in Phoenix.  It's definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Took my wife out for her birthday, we were both looking forward to trying this place out.  But it started off confusing walking through a back door past a 'gym' and standing at an intersection as people walked past  with no words of where too go.  We made our way too the check in, hostess area.  We were promptly seated and than waiting for our server, and waited.  After being told we were gonna be started with water we looked over the menu and was disturbed with someone else's drink order.  We went back to the menu, waiting too order, and waited.  We,ordered drinks and our meal at the same time cause of the wait.  As we sat we weren't comfortable with the atmosphere, first a train went by blowing the horn every, 10 seconds, which is understandable, but than the music, this was now a club that served food.  We were than disturbed with another other that wasn't ours.  We understand once but twice...  our food came and my burger was good but my wifes meat loaf was buried under ketchup.  We ate while rolling our eye at eachother about our food.  The noise level was ridiculous for a simple meal.  I wanted to leave after we ordered water, but the wife said no.  Should of trusted my gut. I will not be going back"}
{"text":"Ok. So the nachos were delicious. They come with a delicious cheese sauce, the usual guacamole and sour cream and pork belly. There were none left on the plate. I washed those down with a bacon infused Bloody Mary and followed that with the Gorgonzola Chicken Salad. This salad has the right mix of crunchy, tart, sweet and savory. Trust me this is a must go."}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy before a show or when you are in the mood for great appetizers with a wonderful twist.  My favorite was the Thai chicken wings with shredded cabbage but the deviled eggs with prosciutto are outstanding.  Mike was our server and did a standout job especially for a tourist area.  They have separate beer and happy hour menus and the selection is great. All in all a great place to enjoy before a show.  The restaurant opens onto the pool and garden and is quite comfortable. I will be back."}
{"text":"Sweet corn cannelloni was to die for. Great atmosphere. Reasonable prices. Absolutely incredible staff. All around great place to eat. Will probably frequent while I'm here."}
{"text":"So, here's the thing. I already have a chip on my shoulder about Fox Restaurants. Mostly because, while I adore most of their concepts, I have found the quality of their food to be uneven at best. 

The first time I ate at C.D. I was certain that this was the place that would change my mind. Amazing burger. Superb even. I didn't even mind the fact that it was giant-sized. Ate half and enjoyed every minute of it. Fun drink list. Good apps. Cute, eager server. All in all, a great introduction.

Then, the second time. A salad. Lacking variety of texture and totally overdressed (and not in the \"didn't she know it was casual Friday\" sort of way...). The server was trying really hard but it seemed like everyone was stretched just a little thin.

So, we are back to \"uneven\"...

Overall, I think I would come here again. I really want to try it for dinner. And it is way better than the Pink Taco, which inhabited the space before. The food has potential and there are still several things on the menu that I haven't tried that sound good."}
{"text":"I had a good meal here and the music was kicking!  Way better than the pool party music from earlier!!  I will definitely be back! So many others options to still try..."}
{"text":"Came here with a group for work. I made a reservation.  We were seated at a table in the rain.  Upon our request not to sit in the rain the hostess sat us at another table with the understanding we had to leave within an hour because that table was reserved.  She did not appreciate my logic of sitting some other dummy in the rain. The service was odd, indifferent and slow.  The food was just ok.  It was $350 for 8 people and completely embarrassing.  Stay away for business functions."}
{"text":"Third time I've been, third amazing experience. Whoever doesn't like the Fried Chicken doesn't know what authentic means. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I was visiting a good friend of mine in Phoenix this past weekend. Saturday night we decided to meet some other friends for dinner and chose Culinary Dropout. Yes, it's hip, has a cool vibe going on and the food is great! The decor is funky (love the chandeliers), the wait staff is friendly and fun and I love the outdoor seating area. Perfect for a November Saturday in Scottsdale! Yes, we managed to score an outside table, even though it was 7pm on a Saturday. We started with the pretzel fondue and YUM! Wanna make it at home! I myself had the ricotta gnocchi - a delicious bowl of upscale comfort food! It had mushrooms and sausage, it was creamy and velvety and just plain good! My friends had steak, short rib pasta and salmon and one of them ordered the chocolate cake in a mason jar for dessert. How novel, but wonderfully warm and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant. I'm hoping the Fox restaurants in Tucson will compare, as I have yet to try them out."}
{"text":"Yum, I really liked this place! Trendy yet laid-back atmosphere, huge couches/chairs, and awesome chill servers. No need to get fancy here - just order a beer and relax. The Winter Salad I had was SO GOOD... sweet potatoes, goat cheese, pomegranate, apples... perfection! Definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Really good food, and a fun atmosphere! Short wait time to get a table for 2. The staff was knowledgeable about the menu and very professional. This was a great place to go when visiting."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on Sunday before heading to the airport. We were able to squeeze into a spot at the bar. This place definitely has a rustic chicness with a slight rebellious energy. I love the chandeliers and the green vintage couches. A drop-down garage door opens up to the outdoor patio and the iconic Hard Rock pool. There's also a 12-seat raw bar and a full antipasti bar if you're feeling the urge. 

I went with the wildly popular soft pretzels with provolone fondue.  So delicious! The soft pretzels come with sea salt and are so warm and pillowy. The fondue sauce was wonderful with a nice sharp bite and a creamy irresistible texture. Nothing like dunkin' fresh-baked pretzel bites into a pot of creamy fondue. Real crowd pleaser! 

Reconnect with your inner child and go with the Cap'n Crunch French Toast. Dusted with powdered sugar and fresh raspberries and drizzled with a lovely custard sauce. The flavors meld together so well. This French toast has it all! 

The menu offers up such a variety with fried chicken, king crab legs, salmon, oysters, grilled cheese sliders, jambalaya, 36-hour pork ribs, pork belly cubano, cheese plates, Korean rib eye cab and monkey bread...just to name a few.

Culinary Dropout is proving to be a heavyweight in the Hard Rock world, joining the likes of Nobu, Pink Taco and 35 Steaks & Martinis. This place is a great hangout spot with screens, libations, fun appetizers and dishes and a prime pool-side locale. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're staying in the Hard Rock, this is a pretty good option in the hotel. I tried the pretzels, which were recommended on Yelp. Fondue was great, pretzels were just OK. I wouldn't get those again. The fried chicken was all around decent, but not unique in any way. Normally, I'd be happy with that. However the whole theme of this place is pushing the boundaries. Wait staff and service were great. I'm leaving less excited than I entered and can't really recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome place, awesome vibe, awesome food, and awesome service (they even mailed me my sunglasses after I left them on a table).  A great place to escape the heat in Tempe after a long day!"}
{"text":"Had reservation for 9 on a Thursday around 4:30pm. 10 showed and the waiter flat out told us we could not have another chair. 
Mix up with drinks and most of our party got drinks right away but some of us sat around w/o for some time. Then the real kicker hostess comes up and tells us we have to leave pretty much right now as they needed the table for another party. 

There were like 50 to 60 empty chairs in the restaurant. I would not go back here unless forced to go for some other event and then I would make damn sure we had a reservation and I got there early otherwise I might not get a chair!"}
{"text":"Get the grilled bistro steak! It was cooked perfectly and paired with potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Always the perfect portion. I started with a cheap salad as well, yum! Great service and awesome live music."}
{"text":"This is only for the Happy Hour.
To make this short, the happy hour there sucks!
1st they cut the food prices in half but then they give you smaller sizes or leave things off.
The Grilled Cheese Sliders 
Happy Hour: Toast and Cheese 
Normal Menu: Bacon, tomato's, cheese and toast? How is that even a deal?
The salad is half price and half the size?
The beer deals are Ok nothing special.
Im not going back."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed as the food we ordered was average with a minimal selection. Mostly younger folks, lots of drinking"}
{"text":"First I wish they had one in Tucson. This place is a great idea with three restaurants in a shared location with a common outdoor patio with games and such. Thursday lunch visit, service was great, food was super delicious (pretzel fondue and turkey pastrami sandwich), ice tea is slightly flavored and just as delicious. Atmosphere is really cool (urban chic). Great music and still able to have conversations. Will definitely be back and bringing the kids (our Jr food connoisseurs)."}
{"text":"My first experience at Culinary Dropout was not what I had expected. However, my second experience completely made up for the last. Our server was great, the food was amazing like the last time. I'm grateful to have had Culinary. Gotta try the pretzel bites!!! And Of course also everything is worth a try from their menu."}
{"text":"\"School Cafeteria Dropout\" is more like it.

Really pretty disappointed after all I heard so much about this place.  

I had the Butternut Squash Cannelloni which seems like it was house made, +1 on that, but was excessively salty.  It was Edible, but missing something in the flavor department.

Tried a sampling of other's food and it was similarly lackluster.

Top that off with being over crowded and uncomfortable as can be: Too nosiey, choice of couch bent over low table to eat or metal high stool/chairs that made my skinny butt uncomfortable.

Our server was friendly and I felt for the guy... being that 3 times food was returned to the kitchen having come out completely wrong."}
{"text":"Man were we tired after a long travel day.  Started looking around for a bite to eat and we landed here.  Was really great.  Ribs were sauced perfectly and tender.  Kids enjoyed their food too.  My wife had the fried chicken really enjoyed it.  Atmosphere and is funky and cool.  Love it when a roll of the dice pays off!

Oh and be pretzels with provolone fondue.  I'd go there just for that.  Amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"We come here often and everything is pretty great. We usually head straight to the bar and order drinks. The service is pretty fast and the servers are all really nice and friendly. The prices are good here and everything is top notch. My spouse usually gets the brown bag special, which is a mystery beer for only 2$

We would come back here again."}
{"text":"The grilled salmon, strawberry kale salad is to die for. The flavor is spot-on. However for the price, I wish they put on some more salmon instead of itty bitty pieces. The service is pretty fast and courteous. I would recommend the pretzel and cheese dip--they are so soft and delish! At times, the place is on the nosier end. I mostly enjoyed the overall atmosphere. The warehouse feel of the restaurant reminded of dining places in Dallas. The ambiance was hip and trendy. I hope to check out the live music on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is a great spot for drinks and socializing. It is a very tending place with good atmosphere. There drink selection is great and the food is amazing. I have always had great service here and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Pros- nice decor, good use of space.  The pretzel fondue is quite good. 

Cons-really bad service, really screwed up what we ordered.  No mayo actually means no mayo.  Can't really say anything good after that. 

Skip this place"}
{"text":"I went here twice for lunch (almost in one day). Everything is made in house. Non of that soup in a bag nonsense. Yesterday's soup is pretty good by the way. I had the tortilla chicken something or other. The fried chicken is pretty fing good. The biscuit? Phenomenal biscuit. And I can make a mean biscuit. Let's see.. Oh I had the corn chowder cannelloni. That was amazing. I didn't get to try any drinks but seeing that there was some hipster guys behind the bar with righteous beards that made me feel less of a man I think they are probably pretty amazing. (The beards too). Anyway if you are in town eat here. You probably will not be disappointed unless you are a terrible human. Sorry for the lack of punctuation. I didn't pay much attention in public school. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here. Food is always great and the staff is always friendly. 

The only reason why I'm docking a star is because last time we went, my boyfriend had an allergic reaction to some biscuits with his meal that did not supposed to have nuts in it. I assume the tray they were baked on was used for their desserts as well. I hope it was just a one time thing, as we've always had attentive servers at CD when it comes to our allergy requests and questions."}
{"text":"Please don't order the oysters I almost threw up.... This place sucks!!! Everything we ordered was dry and nasty, service sooo slow"}
{"text":"Met up with some friends for a bite and had a nice time.  A little confusing and not a fan of the forced valet parking, but food and service were very good.  I had the Thai Chili Chicken Wings and the House made potato chips.  Both were very good.  The wings had a great flavor and were not spicy hot.  The character came with onion dip and it was delicious.  Put server was excellent.  Sorry I don't recall his name."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hang out in Las Vegas. The food is always good, and I've never had anything but great service here. The staff is so nice. Just seems like you're hanging out with friends that keep bringing you stuff. I'm a fan of the fire pits outside too. I had the breakfast burrito last weekend and it was so good. I wanted to keep eating it after I was already stuffed. The pretzels are one of our favorites too if you need a snack, and the hummus. Yum."}
{"text":"Writing this review is making me want to go eat there again. right now. I've been meaning to try Culinary Dropout since it opened in 2014 since it's always been only a mile away. I FINALLY got to try it and I'm so glad I went. 

My favorite thing about CD is the interior. From the outside, it looks like a shed with empty spaces, which is honestly what I was expecting. I was blown away the minute I walked in because I was surprised with a long low-lit hallway (I know it sounds sketchy) which led into the great dining area. The light fixtures hanging from the top were so so nice, and the red couches, and the curtains, and the game area, the high ceiling, the bar...I could go on and on. The music was great, some songs I had never heard of before and some that I have. The games area and the patio were closed off for a private event so we didn't get to see it. 

The next best thing is the food. My friend and I were a little worried about what we would eat because I was always told by peers that CD is expensive. However, it was apparently Happy Hour when we got there. We ordered the Grilled Cheese Sliders, BBQ Pork Belly Nachos, Thai Chile Chicken Wings, and Fresh Hand-cut Fries--listed in the order I liked them the best. The sliders were the absolute best!  The perfect amount of crisp and softness and the cheese oh my gosh. The nachos plate was HUGE and the pork was cooked to perfection with amazing flavor. My mouth is currently watering. The wings were tangy but not overly, with a little spice. The meat was soft and the pieces were big. I did have one problem though-on two of my pieces the meat inside was a under cooked--it was really really pink/almost red (hence the lack of one star). The fresh were soft and just right with the salt. The sliders, nachos, and fries were from the happy hour menu which I definitely encourage taking advantage of.  

We went around 3 pm on a Tuesday and it was relatively quiet and not full. It is a little on the pricier side compared to other restaurants on campus, but rightfully so because of the type of place it is. It looked like they would be able to accommodate numerous groups due to the large space. Our server, Ash, was fantastic! All the other servers and the hostess were really friendly and helpful. I look forward to coming back here again when I'm starving as I had a lot of leftovers because of the size of the dishes! 

TLDR; Fabulous place for yourself, groups, dates, casual/business lunches/dinners etc. Yummy food in great quantities. Happy Hour. Amazing servers. Pretty lights."}
{"text":"The pretzels with fondue are ah-mazing!  Great cocktails and service. The seared tuna salad was very good and the right size - not too big and not too small. If you like summer beer, get the German grapefruit beer - fantastic!  Great spot to grab lunch!"}
{"text":"I have so many things to say about this place. 

I walked in and turned to my boyfriend and said, \"it's so crazy... There's a place a lot like this in Phoenix. It's called the yard.  They soooo need something like this in LA.\" Low and behold, they are the same company. With that being said, I lovvvveee the brand. It's so fun and relaxed and the food is really really good. 

We were just eating light so we waffled between the fried chicken and the 36-hour ribs. I'm so glad we went the ribs direction. They were fall-off-the-bone tender. We also shared oysters, which were fresh and cold and perfect. 

Really cool place. The server with the Tool tattoo on her arm was fantastic. At ease yet attentive. She was great!! I will definitely be back and I've added it to my places to recommend to visitors."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh my gosh. We said we wanted a food adventure, and we definitely got one at Culinary Dropout.

During our visit to Phoenix, a friend took us to Culinary Dropout, and I was immediately entranced by its hipster vibe. Inspirational quotes at the entrance, open space seating, brick walls, and super chill workers. There's also a huge bar area in the middle, a separate banquet-like room for private events, and a stage. We were also starving -- we had flown in early that morning and didn't have a proper lunch -- so, in our hungered craze, were a bit over-ambitious in ordering.

We also did not expect portions to be effing. huge. HUGE.

We started with the soft pretzels and provolone fondue. The pretzel buns are so deliciously soft and warm, and the fondue is the perfect match for it. I swear, I probably could have eaten the entire order and been perfectly happy. But we stopped ourselves from devouring all of the buns so that we could save room for our entrees. (Fun tip: the pretzel buns are actually still pretty good the next day! Just pop them into the microwave for a few seconds. So don't feel guilty about packing up a box to-go.)

The boyfriend and I split the fried chicken and 36-hour pork ribs. They were nice enough to split the order onto separate plates so we didn't have to deal with cutting everything up and trading plates. But dang. When they brought the plates out, each half order was more than enough to fill what we thought would have been a normal-sized order. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, and the ribs were tender and fall-off-the-bone good. Needless to say, we were so stuffed and couldn't finish everything. We managed to happily roll ourselves out and fall into a deep food coma. Soooo gooood."}
{"text":"If you are starving and thirsty, chances are you will leave this place feeling the same. We came over at 645 pm and order food right away and believe it or not we left at 830pm and never got our food, they took forever to find my card and came back with one that wasn't mine. I got overpriced drinks, nothing special. They need more staff. I will give 0 stars if I could"}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing can't wait to go back to try different things. You must get the fondu pretzel thing  our server Gina was awesome. Hope to see her next time"}
{"text":"I dig the place. The happy hour is pretty decent. It helps that location is centralized and off the strip. There is an outdoor area for dining. I have been here for brunch and I actually prefer brunch here over dinner/ happy hours. But I have to say that those pretzel bites are AMAZING! 

Was not a fan of the service (unless you are at the bar). I just felt that alot of the staff had that \"i'm here to get tips, and do the minimum work... while getting paid\". 

Brunch is what saves this review from getting just two stars. I feel the brunch staff is far more attentive and knows the menu more, while giving their own personal suggestions. LOVE THAT FRENCH TOAST!"}
{"text":"When friends tell me they are heading to Vegas, I always recommend they eat at the Culinary Dropout! Everything we've ever ordered was fantastic - and devoured! The atmosphere was hands-down best place to hang with friends. Servers have perfected the art of hospitality."}
{"text":"Nothing about this restaurant was bad, but it was just not that memorable. I got the grilled cheese--tasty, but something I could probably make at home. Atmosphere was pleasant but somewhat dark. Also, for a \"culinary dropout\" I was hoping for more adventurous or unique foods but all there is, is the typical burgers and salads..."}
{"text":"Ok let me first start  by mention a couple of facts.
1. I have never written a review before.
2. I hate this site.
3. I have 27 years in the restaurant industry.  Mostly BOH but plenty of FOH.
4. I was eating  there with my Culinary Arts Students.
I had a reservation but was 30 minutes early. No problem.  Got to the table and it was clear  to me that the evening previous was busy.  Other tables were set ours was not And never was. In a corner booth on the patio. A piece of tomato was on the back of my giant chair as well as crumbs on the bankette.
Our waitress was friendly and full of energy. And I  know this is petty but  her clothes were very dirty. As if she had worked in them the night before or had just milked a cow. 
As our table was not set I needed to ask for sugar for tea.
When the caddie arrived all the packets had been wet and dried so the sugar would not come out and stuck to the paper receptacle. Which I thought was funny. 
It is not. 
I heard this waitress apologize at least 6 times while I there. To me and to the nearest table. 
After two courses I had to get up to find salt and pepper. 
I should have just looked in my tea because the pepper seemed or at least some of it was floating in it. And of  the 4 people who came to ask how everything was in an hour none of this noticed.

All in all the food was fine. What I would expect from a Fox Restaurant and a little  bit better really but even a Culinary Drop Out would not serve a whole yellowish tomato with a mussel.
Please work with your FOH staff. Or at the very least have a manager who cares.
I"}
{"text":"Great food and service. 
Led Zeppelin cover band, \"The Song Remains the Same\", although touted as the best band that plays there, was not good at all."}
{"text":"Wow..
Everything was oh so good. 
From the Bloody Mary, Hummus, fried chicken. No room for dessert. Everyone was so attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Hard Rock and wanted some convenient food - this place was recommended by the front desk. 

I sat at the bar and ordered the kale salad (who does that?) and some wine. Salad was great, loved all the textures and light on the dressing which I prefer. Nice laid back environment."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise on a weeknight... Great atmosphere and friendly staff. The furniture is rad, very eclectic feel in here with a great cozy vibe, and the food was really fun too. The pretzels with cheese fondue is delicious and huge, we couldn't finish it and we were too full to order dinner- great app for 4 people to share. They have great little snacks that are cheap so you can try a little of everything and not worry about how much you're ordering. I can't wait to come back when it's warmer out and hang on their patio!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, eclectic dining room, nice patio seating. Went for happy hour - great deals! Would return to order from the regular menu."}
{"text":"I love the pretzels and cheese! Fun environment for any group of people, I've seen business people, 20 somethings, and families all enjoying the food and service. Love sitting at the bar!"}
{"text":"The service was pretty slow for a mostly empty restaurant. But, my SO & I ordered the turkey pastrami & pub burger. They were both fantastic. I had the turkey pastrami & the pretzel bun it comes on was what I wish for every bun to be like- nice & crispy in the inside & fluffy on the outside."}
{"text":"Great vibe and food. I ordered everything truffle and it was all superb! Ate outside and enjoyed the breeze. Seating was quick and my waitress provided stellar service. Will definitely be returning.."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas on a company trip and over 200 of us stayed at the HardRock Hotel.  When we got to the hotel around lunch time we had some free time to spend for lunch

We didn't want to go too far since we had to be at the hotel by a certain time so we searched for restaurants inside the hotel.  Culinary Dropouts sounded interesting since we've had Hard Rock Café and Pink
Tacos before so about a 12 of us decided to check it out.

There we see the lunch menu was dominated by a selection of burgers so we all ordered burgers.  I had the pub burger.  Yummy the meat was juicy and the buns were so good~ I should've read the yelp reviews because I know I would totally enjoy the pretzel bites!  I ate everything to the last piece of fries :D

Service was great~ our waitress was fun and happy and had no problem serving our big party :). Thank you for a great time!"}
{"text":"Their take on biscuits and gravy was off and the gravy was not hot enough to melt the added cheese. I still enjoy the place and ambiance and will be back for more great meals On the other hand yesterday's soup was delish and James the manager was nice enough to comp my meal and that's what makes this  restaurant top notch .."}
{"text":"This is a solid four star and if you consider the competition for this place at the Hard Rock they actually venture into the five star category, based on the fact that most of the restaurants at the Hard Rock just try to sell you on atmosphere and not on food. This place has decent portions with good food and fair pricing; everyone in our group enjoyed their meal, from appetizers to main courses. If you find yourself at the Hard Rock in Vegas, give this place a try, they don't over complicate the food and the service is quick and efficient."}
{"text":"In town for a weekend away and the hotel we were staying at recommended this place to us. Great atmosphere, the place was packed but we only had a short ten minute wait. Good menu options that offer GF and vegan choices among their wide variety of comfort foods. We got pulled pork nachos, fried chicken, and a Gorgonzola salad. The food was delicious. The tables next to us got burgers; they looked amazing! The service was great. My only complaint is they don't have a restaurant in my home area!"}
{"text":"I had a birthday brunch with my girlfriends here last month and the ambiance, food & service was great! A few of us had the paper bag special which surprises us with random beers. We snacked on the soft pretzels & provolone fondue which were amazing!! For my entree I chose the smoked salmon avocado toast and WOW!! The only reason I docked a star is because my girlfriends brought in a cake for me and she was charged a $20 service fee which she was never made aware of/we've never encountered anywhere else before. Other than that I'd highly recommend and will be back again."}
{"text":"I've waited 7 days to write this review but the sweetness of the king crab and the slithery deliciousness of the oysters are still fresh in my mind. Oh Culinary Dropout you are bad, very very bad!!! I was staying at the HRH on business and happened to stumble on this place and I'm so glad I did. I don't know if it was one too many vodka whatevers but everything tasted so good. Culinary Dropout you had me at provolone fondu! We started with pretzel and the very good cheese fondu and went to appetizer heaven from there. Next was fries and the homemade chips. Fried were perfectly crisp and the dip for the crunchy potato chips was definitely craveable. Next king crab legs, dozen oysters and huge monster shrimp. The oysters were beyond fresh, I mean it was like someone just dove into the ocean shucked them and brought them to us. Not to big but perfect to enjoy. The crab legs were obese with meat and equally fresh and good. The shrimp were so big that one was equivalent to other restaurants cocktail. Again equally fresh and so yummy. Next not the table was fresh French fries. I know what your thinking, Felicia, you already mentioned you had fries. Well guess what we ordered more!! Pigs, we were pigs!! Lastly, the monkey bread and vanilla bean ice cream. Words cannot do justice to this gooey, cinnamony, pillowy soft pull apart desert demon!! The ice cream was just icing. We didn't even get to any of the main courses so I will definitely be back but it will be so very hard not to order the exact same things. Service was awesome but to be honest the server could have slapped me and I would not have noticed with all of the goods!! You make me proud Culinary Dropout. Oh just in case you were wondering this place is way casual so don't worry about dressing up too much. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This location is beautiful! Our service was very quick and accommodating from all aspects.

 I'm not really sure if there is regular parking but there is complimentary valet (yay) up front! This restaurant seems to be sharing a building with a couple other restaurants so they all share one hostess stand.. smart! 

There are tons of tvs and even games outside to play like ping pong. The inside is super elegant but not formal. We ordered black mussels, side salad, and trout.

The black mussels are delicious and come with bread for dipping. The side salad was surprisingly intricate! I was expecting simple greens with a tomato or something but it was truly all out with tons of veggies. The trout was so soft and juicy. I loved it so much I saved some to eat the next day.

Our server was quick, funny, and accommodating. All out a great experience."}
{"text":"I just came from there. The food was great. The service, though, left a lot to be desired.
I got my food to go, was sent to the bar to order it, and was greeted and had my order taken immediately. BUT, after sitting with an empty glass for at least five minutes, I had to wave to get the attention of the bartender who was standing right in front of me but staring off into the distance. When my food was delivered to the bar, it sat right behind the beer taps for at least 5 to 10 minutes, while the bartenders were serving using those taps, until someone finally got it for me and I wasn't even offered a to-go cup for my iced tea. I assume because I wasn't wearing a skimpy bikini, I was just invisible. These guys certainly didn't deserve the nice tip I gave them."}
{"text":"Food was great & drinks were great too!! The atmosphere was amazing, totally cool. Inside & outside bar with couches & electronic fire pits in the middle. Ping pong tables, corn hole, & shuffle board games in the outside part! So much fun!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for lunch.  In their defense, I was dumb enough to order their Shrimp and Pork Belly ramen as did another friend of mine.  Not surprisingly, the ramen was horrible.  The waitress did tell us it was very good when we asked her, but it should have been obvious to us that the restaurant/bar didn't look like a \"ramen\" type of spot.  My review is based on my one and only experience there and what I ate.  My other friends had their pork belly toast and said it was very delicious. If there is a next time, I would definitely stick with something safer (e.g. Burger)."}
{"text":"I like this place okay. Really cool space and ambiance, however it gets crazy busy on the weekends and unless you're seated at a table, there's no where to sit in the 'yard' area. Sometimes they check your ID's at the door and also at the back barn area, even if you've been stamped and are already holding a drink, which is weird and annoying to me. I don't like having to pull my wallet out again while balancing a beer to show that I can enter another room to drink my beer that I have already been drinking."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Fresh and flavorful! Unusual pairings done very well! Easy pleasant service and very knowledgeable! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really good service.

I actually wasn't a fan of the pretzels. The fried chicken is good. It's like an upscale KFC. The biscuit is delish and mashed potatoes were nice. I really liked the pork belly nachos too."}
{"text":"Second time around, and I am not above admitting when I was wrong. 
This time the experience was way different. We had a server that was knowledgeable and on the ball - frankly, she was absolutely wonderful. The whole restaurant seemed in a cheerful mode and there was live music that I honestly paid little attention too. Even our fellow patrons seemed of higher standard than last time I visited CD. 

Food
My date had the Gorgonzola Chicken Salad, and I had the Chicken Curry. The salad was awesome, and next time I will probably go with a salad myself. I got the curry out, and I expected an Indian curry (don't know why) but instead I was surprised with a Thai-curry. Very tasty and very nice. It is served with potatoes (integrated, not as a side) which was an unexpected approach, but again very tasty. 
Dessert was unnecessary after our meal, but I went for it anyhow and sprung for the Salted Caramel Custard. It was a different take, and it looked great. It was super sweet though. Not my style of dessert, probably because I am a self proclaimed gourmand with a texture and consistency obsession - but it is a very popular item, well worth trying. 

Ambiance
I was so surprised how much I appreciated this place in a different light once I got a great server. This place is still feeding of off its own hipness, but that is all right - in fact it has its own charm. In fact I really enjoyed just being here and embrace my surroundings. (Possibly sipping on a paperbag special)

Service
We just had the best service. Our server was personable, and didn't hesitate to recommend when asked. I would love to give her all credit, but I don't want to hang out my fellow yelper by name ;) It made the whole experience just that much better. 

I wasn't going to come back, but I am sure glad I did. And I will again, and again.. and whenever friends from out of town comes by."}
{"text":"My first visit a lunch visit was V. enjoyable.  The pretzel balls were doughy heaven then to add fondue....you had me at hello,,, good.  My crunchy shrimp caesar was a nice portion size and a creative spin on a great traditional salad.  We didn't have to wait at lunch and the service was fair."}
{"text":"This is absolutely a great Restaurant. I will Highly Recommend this Place. Awesome Service! Food was on point!! If you are looking for a Laid back kind a Day/Night this is the Spot. Check it out! Everything is just Lovely and Friendly."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the owners of Culinary Dropout and North. I am very eager to try all of their locations and restaurants because I always leave satisfied and full!

My family and I came here for lunch on our annual trip to Arizona for the holidays. We were 5 women and sat at the cutest round table (my fav because you can see everyone) in fun, different arm chairs. The atmosphere is really chiq and lively.

We started off with the soft pretzels served with provolone cheese. I never knew melted provolone cheese could be so delicious, but it is! I think my cousin and I enjoyed this the most and probably ate the most because it is that good! As my lunch, I had the grilled cheese sliders. It was the perfect blend of cheese with bacon.

Culinary Dropout is a must try when in the Scottsdale area. I cannot wait to go back and try something else from their electic menu."}
{"text":"I like the place, great happy hour for food and drinks, indoor/ outdoor seating with a giant patio.  Cornhole, ping pong, giant jenga, football, it's a fun place to hang out and relax. Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"Food was really good, they a good amount of vegetarian options for appetizers. The butternut squash pasta is delicious and the waitress staff are really cool and helpful."}
{"text":"Came here for a work event. Honestly, the food was alright. Not the biggest fan of their main dishes, which included mini burgers, nachos, and wings. However, am definitely a big fan of their dessert. Their banana cream pie is honestly so great and would recommend.

Tried a few of their drinks. Room service is a great one if you don't like the taste of alcohol and prefer juicy drinks.

Also, they do have a nice reservation policy for companies, so great for large parties."}
{"text":"Yummy food, nice staff, fun atmosphere. Wish the outdoor seating was cooled better (even with the misters it gets very hot/uncomfortable) and that the pricing was a little lower, but overall I'm pleased with this place and go often."}
{"text":"Please excuse this review as I am writing it as I come to from my food coma. We just moved to Phoenix and at the time of dining we were not familiar with the Fox Restaurant Group. We happened upon CD on accident on a Tuesday night. I must say the place was pretty hoppin' for an early week night. We ordered the pretzels with fondue, the fried chicken and the steak. It was so good we didn't even speak to each other through the entire sitting. It was the kind of meal you don't mind having indigestion after because you get the pleasure of re tasting the deliciousness. Gross, I know, but you know what I'm talking about! The server we had was as good as a ghost. We never wanted for anything but he left us alone. I wasn't super crazy about the monkey bread but my honey ate it like we hadn't had a ridiculously large meal 15 minutes before. I'd kinda like to shave off like a 1/4 of a star because the staff was ultra trendy/Indie as were a majority of the patrons. They looked like H&M and Urban Outfitters threw up all over them but if that's the gimmick I'm ok with it since the food was so amazing."}
{"text":"Had the grilled chicken sandwich with havarti cheese and bacon. And a margarita. Both were absolutely delicious!! First time coming here. Didn't partake in the fun activities on site but the food and drink alone was worth the visit! Booked a reservation to spend New Years here with a group of friends!!"}
{"text":"Food is spectacular... service not so much!  Service is slow, and she couldn't remember our order, even though I filled in our appetizer order and disappeared a lot."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, food and drinks. The beef dip and the grilled cheese are delicious. Highly recommend. Love the room service as my beverage of choice. Waiting to obtain game pieces from the hostess stand is ridiculous. Very poor set up for that. Better chances picking up a game with someone already playing."}
{"text":"Went with the extended family and some guests from England.  Service was very good, food was good but not great (so 4 stars). Really cool space with lots of beautiful people milling about."}
{"text":"So during my visit to Las Vegas me and my cousin decided to try this place out. The set up is beautiful, the out door seating area is cozy, the lighting is dim but it fits the style of this restaurant. 

They have a raw bar which I loved $3 oysters and $3 white shrimps ($3 each)
We also order the fried chicken, it comes with mash potatoes, cole slaw, and a biscuit. The fried chicken smelled good, however after cutting into it we noticed it was pink and still bleeding. We did inform the manager, however we were told that is normal. I'm pretty sure you can get sick from eating raw/under cooked chicken. 

Our server Billy was ok, sometimes you catch people on a bad day. The manager had good energy and was extremely nice.

I would try this place again, I would just be simple about what I order."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday and had their version of the big mac (it was enough to split between myself and my friend), and split a salad.  The salad could have been bigger,  but it was really good.  They gave us a free dessert since it was my birthday.  It was a smores sundae which was AMAZING.  i was only able to eat a couple bites as I was stuffed,  but it was really good.  The drinks from the bar were well crafted as well.  Nice kick."}
{"text":"This is a very cool place in a awesome part of Tempe.   I had the House smoked salmon breakfast and it was average my husband had the Kentucky Hot Brown and he loved it.  Friends had the turkey pastrami sandwich and they enjoyed it.  The service was really good and overall enjoyed CD."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and I have a good experience every time. They are always super pack when I come so I can't say every experience has been flawless but the employees are nice and obviously work hard to give you a good experience. The food is delicious and the yard is a lot of fun. Basically if you don't have a good time here you is seriously your own fault."}
{"text":"I love the food & the atmosphere at Culinary dropout, BUT making a reservation for a group is nothing short of ridiculous.  this is not the 1st time this has come up, so I'm compelled to finally comment.  I have 9 friends in town and want to take them here BUT they don't take reservations past 6 PM.  really??????  so we're left hoping (if I decide to take them, which I won't now) we can get a hightop (again, for NINE people) or couch area, and have to wait for a table at that point.  funny, the Thirsty Lion & several others take reservation times all evening long, and always gets me in (I give them 5 starts for service, food & atmosphere).  you've lost a nice chunk of money this evening, and several others at this point, but guess that probably doesn't matter.  your bad (and no, not 'you're bad')."}
{"text":"the environment is very nice and the food is good! the price is not too bad either. Their cocktails are sooo good. I went with my friends and share the pretzel bits (very much recommended). I also shared a butternut squash salad with salmon added. I thought that was plenty for 2 people since we got the pretzels. I have never been disappointed while eating here. I recommend getting a reservation because even with a reservation you'll be waiting 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I thought Culinary Dropout was a great experience. I met a friend here for dinner on a Saturday night. We decided to sit at the bar outside because the place was pretty busy. 

Eating at the bar was pleasurable. My friend and I became completely enthralled with this what seemed to be whipped cream the bartender was making. Turns out it was actually pomegranate foam to top off one of their cocktails. the clown punch. Since I am always down for anything pomegranate I just had to have it. Excellent cocktail! I totally recommend it!

My friend and I decided to split the fish and chips and a burger. Both were very good. Burger was good, but nothing too memorable. The fish and chips were awesome! I totally would order it again.

What a great space with a great menu, staff and atmosphere. Way better use of the space than stupid Pink Taco."}
{"text":"Super hip restaurant across the street from Fashion Square. Plenty of underground parking.

I came here on a Friday evening for dinner with friends, and we had a great time. The atmosphere is hip and they even had a live band! The food was indulgent and delicious. I'd highly recommend the Fried Chicken.

Overall, CD is a great place for dates and groups of friends. I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"Thirsty? Order the paper bag special. It's basically cheap beer, but a cool story behind the name. Drown your sorrows right along with the servers that coined this clever concept. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My go to spot when visiting Las Vegas! Great breakfast! Every time I stay at the Hard Rock it's a must!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Cool vibe. Ping pong & cornhole. Good food. Our first time at Tempe location. The Tucson location is a go to for us when we're in town. Great place to cool off when in AZ. Cocktails. Pretty good beer list. Fun environment for kids, teens, young adults and families."}
{"text":"Cute hip little joint good food and service 
We had a great time and actually went back"}
{"text":"This makes the fourth installment of visiting culinary dropouts! One of the outstanding things about the restaurant is no matter which one you go to the food is consistent and great! The pretzel fondue and Italian Salad are spectacular!"}
{"text":"Located within the hard rock hotel, this place is a very casual yet trendy. The staff is always friendly and courteous. Do yourself a favor come in during happy hour and order the pretzels and fondue or the house potato chips and onion dip!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot, my third time to visit and I'm never disappointed! The staff are all very friendly, especially Evan. My friend and I stopped in for lunch before leaving to go back to DFW. Sometime between lunch and our cab, my friend lost her jacket. We called CD to see if it had been left, when we were told no, Evan offered to run up and down the street looking for where she may have dropped it. He did not find it, but the fact that he took time from his busy lunch crowd was impressive. Thank you Evan and all the CD staff for your help!"}
{"text":"I want to give kudos to the manager Clancy Smith... I ordered an entree with two friends.. there meals arrived  and were consumed and mine was never delivered. Clancy went out of his way to make sure we were incredibly happy.. Side note my friends loved their turkey pastrami sandwhihes"}
{"text":"So I'm sitting at the bar and I've never had a better old fashion that what superstar Ian poured... seriously... this drink and the service was amazing and if you read my other reviews I'm a jerk!

So thankful for this day"}
{"text":"We came here MLK weekend for a friend's birthday.  There was a group of about 10 of us dining.  The service was great.  Everyone had their beverages going.  We ordered the pretzels and fondue (always a good choice). My friend ordered the pork belly and shrimp ramen.  It was OK.  I ordered the meatloaf.  Nothing too exciting.  The flavor was sweeter than I liked, but still good.  I really like this addition to Tempe."}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Loved \"The Yard\" even though we didn't have time to play. Food was great.  Very crowded and had a reservation but had to wait about 25 mins anyway. Valet service was very good and a must for this location. Live music was good but made it impossible to really talk during dinner.  Very fun and open atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Culinary Dropout at The Yard is a GREAT place to go for food, fun, games, drinks, events or just to hang out and relax. 

The menu is awesome, the staff is friendly and the place is a lot of fun. 

The Antipasti plates are a great way to start. They also have salads, soup, sandwiches and some really good entrees. The roasted salmon is tough to pass up. Other things on the menu are Shrimp and pork belly ramen, Meatloaf, fried chicken, a bistro steak with gorgonzola that is *really* good, sweet potato cannelloni and more. 

Do yourself a favor and save room for the \"Bourbon Black Bottom Pie\" for dessert. You'll thank me, I promise. 

They have a full bar and a bunch of specialty drinks, too. For local brews, they serve up hops from Four Peaks, San Tan, Huss Brewing and more. 

The place is cool, for sure. Good for small and large groups. Private meeting space available, as well.

Valet parking is available.

A great addition to Downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"This is definitely somewhere that requires a return visit! 

We were quite a large group and were seated out in The Yard - a large covered patio space filled with cosy couches, tons of super hot fire pits, and games. Sadly I didn't get to try the games this time around but hopefully I will next time - I feel like that could have been a highlight!

We sat at a fire pit with a large L-shaped couch on one side, and several adorably mismatched chairs surrounding the other two sides. The fire pit was HOT, seriously hot! Open flame and booze seems like a risky combination to me, but who doesn't love a good backyard fire pit?? 

It was a little tricky eating our meals off the side of the fire pit, and there was more than one occasion that had me concerned I was going to a. set something on fire, or b. have a melted beer glass from the sheer heat of the flames!

My beer was quite tasty - a good local brew. We shared some tasty devilled eggs, some ok potato chips (a little greasy and under-flavoured for me), and some well done hummus (you can't go wrong with hummus!). For my main I had the grilled cheese sliders; I'm not sure what I was expecting but the flavour wasn't quite there. The three little sandwiches were super cute and filled with well melted cheese slices, bacon and tomato - great for when you're looking for good throwback food to your childhood!

I'm looking forward to my next trip here - I think it has huge potential and I had fun, I just think I could have a lot more fun next time! :)"}
{"text":"We went for dinner on a Saturday evening and thought we would go a little early. It's a very popular place and lots of people were already hanging out by 5:30. There are multiple venues in one location and to the novice a little confusing but after we walked around a bit we figured it out. We were seated inside because it was a Phoenix scorcher but it wasn't much cooler inside than in the outside area. The noise level was way over the top with the restaurant at only 50% capacity. It was so difficult to hear each other and the server. The first server dropped off an antipasto order sheet and didn't really explain what it was. It wouldn't matter couldn't hear her anyway. The second server greeted us and gave us great customer service. He acknowledged that it is always loud and gets louder as the evening goes on and noted his ears ring at the end of his shift and his throat is sore from having to yell to be heard. But he noted that there is a live band that shows up later. Really? You can't hear your table mates as it is. We ordered the fried chicken and steak and potatoes. The fried chicken was good but the steak and potatoes were not. It was too fatty and flavorless and the potatoes were burned. The server noticed i didn't like the meal and offered to get me something else. At least I think that was what he was saying. :-) Three drinks and the meal above came out to $80 of disappointment. All in all it's a hipster hangout and a cool scene but not a place for great dining and not a place to catch up with friends or take a date. We probably won't return."}
{"text":"Took some friends here that were visiting from Alabama. It was also our first time. We all really enjoyed our lunch. Sitting outside by the pool was relaxing.

The pretzel and cheese appetizer was probably my favorite part. I also tried the fried chicken that is in a honey batter and the prime rib french dip. For desert we had the caramel popcorn on custard and the monkey bread with ice cream.... MMMMMM!

Had excellent service as well. Our waitress kept our drinks refilled and the manager even said hello as we were being seated and gave some food suggestions."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.   Ordered Pub burger well done and fries.   When burger came it was cooked medium.    Red throughout and juices red.    Not even close to well done.     Mistakes happen and that is fine so I sent back burger.    My burger came after my lunch date was already done eating.

The second burger was cooked OK.    The food overall was just OK  not good or great.    Nothing outstanding about atmosphere.  

Most disappointing part was they charged me for the burger and did not offer anything to compensate for our ruined meal .   My friend had to eat alone and so did I.  No manager came over to apologize. 

We will not go back.   Too many other great choices in that area."}
{"text":"Lots of great drinks. Lots of great food. 

Patio is near pool and fun to hang out during happy hour and enjoy the atmosphere. 

Indoor still open to the patio and lets the birds and breeze in. We sat by window. 

Got the pretzel. So much food. Plenty to share and dip. Built a meat and cheese plate with the crusty bread (5star bread)."}
{"text":"This place is walking distance between my apartment and Mill Avenue. It is easily one of my favorite spots to spend an after work gathering of Sunday afternoon with some friends. They have corn hole and bar games in the back of the venue and nice selection of beers indoors. I particularly like the Menu because they have a bit of everything. I like to get their cheese plate, Thai wings and pretZel fondue. The main entrees are even more expensive but I imagine still worth it because everything here is amazing."}
{"text":"I loved this place like 4 years ago. Came again recently and it's pretty terrible. The food is average, at best. The atmosphere is okay except on weekend nights when they have live music that is SO LOUD that you literally cannot hear the person sitting next to you. For what you're getting, the prices are pretty ridiculous. But the worst part is the service! I was blown away at how terrible the service is here. This place is very Scottsdale, trendy and what not, so definitely good if you're into that! Otherwise, I would suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The pork belly nachos as an appetizer is definitely my favorite. Best part is the chips are made to order so that kicked it up a notch in my book. 
I had the fried chicken for my main course and one of the top 5 fried chicken places I have ever had. 
The female wait staff is easy to look at so I never had a shortage of entertainment."}
{"text":"Really conveniently located in the hard rock hotel of Las Vegas. They have a hip menu and I really recommend going there if you're looking for a brunch vibe. They're breakfast burrito is AMAZING. I stayed at the hotel and went there several times because the food was delicious and the service was good."}
{"text":"I am absolutely amazed by this location every time I go! The people that come out to this location are truly wonderful and always make the best atmosphere for dinner, happy hour, or even lunch! The bar tenders are friendly and attentive, while always having a smile on their faces. The food is delicious and the happy hour menu has so many great, cheap picks to choose from. They were even accommodating when we asked to change the tv channel to a specific game. Plus they have vegetarian options! Love it!"}
{"text":"nice indoor/outdoor atmosphere and other activities to do.  food had a good selection.  vegetarian entrees would be nice.  VALET parking was NOT nice.  having to be forced to park your car and valuables even though it's complimentary, you are obligated to tip.  ahhh no....

the drink was a margarita apple and very good however, small and not cheap $11."}
{"text":"I heard that this was a great place and wanted to check it out for my birthday. The security is very strict in the evenings. I had just moved to Arizona so I had a temporary paper license and my old license with a little hole in it (that's what they do at the DMV). When I presented my old  license, the security guard was very stern and would not accept it and told me to come back with the paper version of it which I left in my car a mile away. (Even tho I'm way past 21). I get it, it's a college town, there are liability issues, but the guy was so unfriendly, I left on the first occasion, not wanting to do a 2 mile trek to return.

I came back for lunch to give it another shot for football Sunday. My friend and I ordered a cheese fondue which I found to be rather mediocre. The cheese resting in a mini cauldron sits on top of a little candle. The cheese hardened within minutes. However, the salads are decent as well as the monkey bread. There are also a multitude of TVs so you can catch whatever team you're rooting for. Great spot to watch sports. 

The outside leads to The Yard so you can play all sorts of games like corn hole, ping pong, take pics at the photo booth, or just hang out."}
{"text":"Meh. Not impressed. True Food... good. Zinbuger... great. This place... meh.

I can think of 100 other places I'd rather drop $30 on food for just myself."}
{"text":"Came for HH and a craving for the Bacon Bloody Mary, but alas there would be no BM's today, as the mixes were not made.  Settled on one of the HH drink specials-a $3 mug of Batch 19 Pre-Prohibition lager.

We sat inside, watched the pool frolickers and I breathed a sigh of relief to see that our drinks were not served in mason jars-they were used for jelly jar lighting instead-insert sigh of relief here-and I could  just get back to singing along with the Arctic Monkeys with my inside voice. 

Soon after we were seated came a whole table of douchery, worse, a hoard of excessively drunk and loud douchery lead by a extremely loud douchebaguette.  Fortunately, she didn't have the moves like Jagger, nor the constitution like Richards and vanished (most likely to the nearest restroom) for the majority of our stay.

All our niblies ( which turned out to be a vast amount of food) were expertly served by Devon:

Pretzel Bites with Provolone Fondue-totally delish carb and cheese goodness

Grilled Cheese Sliders-a bit uneventful

Meatloaf Sandwich-too muted and bland

House Potato Chips & Onion dip-succinctly tasty 

Would definitely return to try their main menu."}
{"text":"Vegas for a Bachelorette party... YES!!!!
Being the maid of honor, I had planned that Vegas weekend to be chill, wild and relaxing all at the same time. 

It was our first night in Vegas (Friday night) and since most of us drove out there from LA, I wanted the girls to have a relaxing night with dinner, drinks and the room right upstairs just in case someone wanted to call it quits early. Therefore, I decided to make reservations at Culinary Dropout. After reading a couple of reviews and checking out their pictures, I liked that it looked like a \"chill\" spot with live music, good drinks and great food.

To begin, the decor was very intimate and yet somewhat hipster-ish yet industrial at the same time. The live band was great. They even played Backstreet Boys!! Took me back to when I was a teen. Haha. Anyhow, the staff was great and our waiter was awesome! He was super attentive and beyond helpful. He definitely made sure we had drinks in our hands. 

For dinner, I decided to go with the steak and potatoes... OMG! This dish is one of the most delicious dishes I've ever had. The meat was beyond juicy and extremely tender. The potatoes were saute perfectly. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.

As a dessert, the waiter gave the bride to be a free Salted caramel custard topped with caramel popcorn. I had a little taste since I'm not big on dessert... deliciousness. It's enough for like 3-4 people since it's extremely sweet.

I would definitely go back to this place. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We love coming here. While we love the food and drinks, we're more in love with the staff. Kyle is a great bartender and server. He always takes good care of us and his personality shines just like the awesome shirts he wears. The rest of the staff is also fabulous. The pretzels are our fave and you can't go wrong with the drunken panda (sake based drink). Money and time well spent"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I decided to check out Culinary Dropout, valet parking, and bouncer to check your age. The ambience is cool, very hipster, plenty of ping pong tables, horseshoes , etc. Drinks are good, if pricey. My friends all ordered different dishes, they were happy, however my shrimp and pork belly ramen was just overtly salty. Salty and the broth was lacking in flavor. Service was nice, all in all pleasant experience , however, order anything else, but the ramen."}
{"text":"Epic atmosphere, great cocktail and beer selection. Fried chicken was \"on point\", moist, crisp and a perfect honey aftertaste. It will be a must for future Arizona trips."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Very impressed with the meat and cheese appetizers. The main courses were unique and not too pricey considering you're in the heart of Scottsdale. 

This place is a must visit if you want a quality dining experience that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Culinary dropout has to be one of my favorite spots to visit on a normal Monday night or a busy Saturday evening. The food is always A-1, and the customer service is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Moved here a few years ago. This place is great for a night out with friends. Lots of different things to do and drinks are made well."}
{"text":"Everyone has been raving about this place, but the food is just OKAY. Nothing is special about it. The following are the reasons for one star:

1) HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! we got a party of 7 on a Thursday evening. When we got there, the hostess wasn't specific and pointed at a table. We sat down, the manager asked us to move because we didn't make a reservation. We moved to the skinny tables for 7 of us next to the bar and shared it with another unknown customer. The table we originally sat down was vacant all evening. They also had 2 more without no one there. Why you pretend your restaurant is busy when it's not??? Mind blowing.

2) my chicken sandwich was awful. The meat is dry and tasteless. My salad had no dressing, I had to ask for it.

3) Overpriced, overpriced and overpriced!!!

4) our server has NO personally. He did not seem to want to be there nor to serve us. No smile. He handed us the flatware with bare hands on my fork. He served other people, cleaned and touched money...who knows what his dirty hands had touched, then handed down the flatware. 

5) the music was so loud that we screamed over one another.

6) the place is hot as hell.

I will never return to this place. Not my cup of tea!"}
{"text":"Met friends for dinner and had no idea how much fun we would have!  Great atmosphere, lots of games and an open, festive environment.  The food was great also and the menu had a wide variety of selections from healthy to not so much but it all was tasty.  We would go back for sure.  

Pub burger, Pretzel with cheese dip and the Asian wings were highlights!!"}
{"text":"Presentation is really sharp, and the prices for a strip location is pretty reasonable. Just becareful with the charcuterie because, that adds up fast. The Capn Crunch French toast was good, not super flavorful but, fluffy which was a plus. The only complaint I had, was the coffee was dreadful lol.. like, the worst of what drip coffee has to offer lol.. however, I would come back here again !"}
{"text":"Was in AZ for a day earlier this month (July) and came here at the recommendation of a client. This place did not disappoint! 

I ordered the 36-hour Pork Ribs. Portion is large and comes with cole slaw and fries. To my surprise (and the waitress') I ate the entire dish. 

Did not have room for dessert, but the next time I'm in Arizona, I'll be sure to stop by again.

Venue is very spacious. Good for large groups. Date friendly as well."}
{"text":"met friends here for lunch.  cute place.  very busy you can sit inside or outside. we chose inside.   our waiter was Coooer.  He was fantastic.  Since non of us had been here before he explained alot of the menue and what he recommended.  
i had the prime rib dip sandwich that came with frys.  The meat was so flavorful and
 moist.  On a role with cheese and the dip was just right in flavor.  fries were extra crispy as I had requested.  
one friend had the Italian Grinder was full of salami, ham, provolone cheese also with french fries very good.
other friend had the Italian chopped salad salami, ham, pastrami cheese.  also good.  
we did start with crusty bread with dolce gorgonzola and strawberrries brie pistachio. was just perfect before the meal.  
we did not know what to expect and we were not disappointed.  
also ask for Cooper he will treat you right"}
{"text":"Delicious food great service! 

Our server Taylor asked us to write a review and I was happy to oblige. The food was terrific. We had 7 people so we got to try a bunch of things: For appetizers we had the pretzels, and a plate of prosciutto and a plate of one of their cheeses. All were so good we couldn't stop. They were out of the Burrata, which sounded awesome.

I had the fried chicken, yum! Mashed potatoes and gravy that came with it were ok but not as good as chicken.

Good beers as well. We went back two nights later, and it was good once again."}
{"text":"I had dinner with some friends and they suggested Culinary Dropout. The menu wasn't that big but they had a few things that caught my eye. I really wanted to try the soft pretzels appetizer but my friend wasn't that hungry so I didn't. The table next to us ordered them though and they looked amazing! lol

I had the Warm Italian Grinder with fries. It was a sort of a grilled sandwich on pretty large bread. My friend ordered the fried chicken and it looked delicious!! I'm not that into fried chicken usually, but I will order it next time for sure!!! She said it was as delicious as it looked.

The atmosphere is laid back but very trendy decorations. Our table had a couch on one side of the table instead of chairs and big, comfy chairs on the other side. So overall a comfortable atmosphere! I noticed a nice patio outside but it was too chilly for us."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I'll start with saying, the night could've been one of the best nights but quickly turned to the worst. All thanks to the bearded, wannabe hippie, JERK of a bartender named Brandon and the unprofessional, rude \"manager\" of the night, Bryan Carter. 

Let me back up, the food was amazing. Probably the best food I've had. Service though...absolutely terrible. We had a freak ping pong accident where a guy in our party cut his head open. The bartender couldn't have been more rude and unprofessional about it. He complained about helping him get a rag, having to clean up a little blood (literally four drops), and gave us nothing but a bad attitude the entire time we were at the bar. 

Moving onto the joke of a manager. After the ping pong incident, we were harassed by a fellow customer. After explaining the situation to the \"manager\", he rolled his eyes and told us there was nothing he could do. Well, there's a lot you could do but you're too lazy to do it. 

I'll end my rant now. But just know, I will never be back. No one from our party will be back. Which is quite unfortunate. Because it is a very delicious restaurant but not worth the harassment and disrespect."}
{"text":"Horrible management.  Good idea having empty kegs near your photo booth area and then kicking out people's designated driver out of the bar when one gets picked up and put down for a photo at your restaurants photo booth.  Spoke to the manager an he could care less.  Last time we will come here.  Idiots."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great food and great vibe!!! The fried chicken and pretzel appetizer was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with so much to offer ...
Stage set up for live performances , always a plus! The decor is old school hipster .! The food is amazing! I had the Kale and Spinach butternut squash chicken salad . A burst of popping flavor. The pretzel buns with fondue ; a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Hit and miss at best.  I was excited to try Culinary Dropout because I've never had a bad experience with a Fox restaurant, but this one came up a bit short.  It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting, perhaps places like North and The Green House have set the bar a little too high.  
First of all, the service wasn't great.  Our server was inattentive, and we spent most of the night getting drink refills and new silverware from another server, who was friendly and happy to help.
Tried an assortment of food off the menu.  The anitpasti was excellent; I loved the selection of meats and cheeses and our ability to mix and match.  Next we had oysters on the half shell.  They were fantastic! After that we tried the gnocchi with Italian sausage.  They shouldn't call it gnocchi, it was more like mashed potatoes.  The whole dish was a bland, mushy mess.  The one saving grace of the dish were the large pieces of Italian sausage.  Finally we tried the cuban sandwich, which tasted good, but was nothing spectacular.  
I'll be back at Culinary Dropout, if only for drinks and apps.  Any place with Moose Drool on tap is pretty good in my book."}
{"text":"I had the French Dip.  Delicious.  Great service.   All around great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Our server was incredibly charming and encouraged us to order the pretzel/provolone fondue. I'm so glad we took his advice. It was delish!! Anything salty & with cheese is great in my book.

My girlfriends all ordered salads here for a late lunch. The portion size was fair and they salads weren't over-dressed.

I'm a big dessert person so I ordered the salted caramel custard & the apple monkey bread. 

The monkey bread was warm, soft and tasty. If you like apples in your dessert you'll love it. It wasn't as cinnamon-y as I would have personally liked.

The custard was divine. It's topped with caramel popcorn which I picked off. 

They have an outside patio seating area and indoor seating as well. Prices averaged around $10-12 per entree."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and helpful staff bring the place to life. The food was good but not amazing. I'd recommend the HH for large groups. I wish we had a place like this at home."}
{"text":"Great food spot with awesome cocktails and a huge beer menu .... there's something for everyone! 

The antipasti make your own board is amazing... you can't go wrong... goat cheese, beats, fig and meat selection is great!

For entrees the sweet corn ravioli is amazing - so rich and well flavored!

Fun spot with live music - enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went here after looking through Yelp reviews for local eats. 

I got there at 740 with a reservation at 8 (for a tip make a reservation because it was busy). I always feel awkward making a reservation for 1 (makes me feel lonely) but whatever. 

The bar area and restaurant had a really laid back but busy vibe. They had a live band which was actually really good. 

I had the Lumberjack Heff....delicious. My solo mission was to get the ribeye cap, but they were sold out (sad emoji). I didn't have a backup plan but I settled starting with the wings. They were nice and crispy but for me a little too salty. For my dinner went for the meatloaf....I thought it was a little underwhelming. It was filling but I wouldn't say great.

The overall area and solid beer choices I'll be back to give it another shot...but only for a ribeye cap. Ribeye cap or bust!"}
{"text":"The pretzels and fondue were AMAZING! That was easily the best part. It's a great spot for a date night. The ambiance is nice. The service was spot on. We got the French dip and chicken sandwich. I preferred the French dip."}
{"text":"This review wont be long. lol

Over priced!

Good decor and people.

Very loud! Have to almost yell at your server during dinner time.

Fun activities.

Interesting restrooms.

Parking Sucks and must valet

Would return when I have another $100 to waste. And I only ordered mussels and several drinks for the wife and I.

How does Fox get away with these prices?? All his establishments are over priced and people love it for some reason. Must be the new hipster age and no concept of the value of money."}
{"text":"The decor is inviting, like having dinner at Z Gallerie! The food was out of this world. I had the crunchy shrimp caesar salad and the two dollar olive oil and bread app. It was fantastic. The service was impeccable. The staff was friendly. The bathrooms are super cute!"}
{"text":"First time here for Labor Day weekend! Had the grilled cheese and it was really yummy! Not just your normal grilled cheese had bacon and tomato and was made on fresh home made bread! Felicia was our bartender she was great and when I couldn't decide on a drink she made one for me! Definitely recommended this place when you're staying at the hard rock"}
{"text":"Extremely loud! But, a fun night out if you want to listen to a live band and hang out on a weekend. That is probably the only reason I wouldn't return for a romantic quiet night out which is what I was looking for on this particular night. Nonetheless, if I'm in the mood for a fun spot to have good drinks and food I would definitely return. Everything we tried was exceptional for being such simple dishes. This restaurant has tricky parking. You valet in the back and it shares sorta of like a play area with barrio urbano where you can enjoy corn hole and ping pong with friends."}
{"text":"Always enjoy this place when I come to The area! The location is just absolutely superb. I prefer a patio type seating, but during the right seasons they have the big doors open anyways. The crowd is always beautiful and popping. They understand gluten free. And have enough options to make it a decent spot for us. The drinks are the real reason to come here. The food is just a proper bonus. 

You will love this spot. I promise!"}
{"text":"The roasted salmon on a bed of black rice was what I ordered.  While it had a good mixture of cauliflower and snow peas, they were a bit on the saltier side and the black rice didn't seem to help.  The salmon itself was alright."}
{"text":"We went here last night on a whim to listen to the band Vinyl Station and they were excellent as usual.  I had no expectations and had a great time.  I dug the atmosphere and vibe.  We both will be going back.  We ordered off the antipasti menu and had the pretzel fondu. Our waiter, Rocky, stated it was a favorite here.  Props to Rocky for being so attentive. We went outside to The Yard and I ordered the modified Moscow Mule at the beer garden area.  Modified, I believe meaning, they use lemon juice instead of lime and there was no copper mug, but that was unnecessary as the drink was more than appeasing.   The food will not knock you off your feet but it's pretty decent, however,  If you are looking for something a bit more eclectic, this is your place.."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome atmosphere and great, friendly staff! Their pretzel bites are a must to start, and I love their garden kale salad. Culinary is great for lunch, dinner or a special occasion"}
{"text":"2.5.

The pictures here looked so good. SO good. Sadly, all the food was pretty meh. Nachos were generic. French fries were horrible. Ribs were crap. Burger was incredibly generic. The fish portion of the fish & chips was decent. Pretzel bites were about the best thing.

Good live music (just a guy/girl guitar duo singing covers on the night we went), though way too loud if you're seated too close to the small stage.

Friendly service, but it was quite slow. At least he was apologetic about it.

Good cocktails, but their signature list is a bit small."}
{"text":"What a great improvement to this space! The Waterfront area is really adding to the number of unique dining choices with the addition of Culinary Dropout. Given that it was opening night, I was still expecting the experience to be rough around the edges. However, you would have thought the restaurant had been open for months. 

The decor is pure Sam Fox. Large chairs, interesting textures and some great chandeliers.  They have successfully shaken the gaudy ghosts of Pink Taco. Happily, they have done so with the menu, as well. 

We were promptly seated and met by Michelle, our server. She was very well versed in all aspects of the menu, including the drinks. I tried the Home-Ec Martini, which I found to be tasty and not too sweet. While others at our table went with more traditional wine and cocktail choices, they were all wowed as I passed my drink around and had them sample. 

For starters, the Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue jumped off the page at us. Yes, it was as good as it sounds. We also had some Prosciutto and Gorgonzola antipasti, which was a surprisingly large serving for the price. A great start to the meal! 

Unlike my boring dining companions (who ordered salads....boo!), I wanted to try an entree. I peppered Michelle with questions. Her overwhelming choice was the Kurobuta Pork Ribs, which she said were marinated overnight and just \"fell off the bone\". 

Let me digress for a moment. I generally don't like ribs of any type; the main reason being that they are messy and hard to deal with. Sure, they're tasty...but the effort-to-reward ratio is just to high. Still, Michelle made an impressive sales pitch, so I relented. Let me just say that my fingers didn't touch one drop of sauce. I was able to easily fork the meat off the bone......incredibly tender and tasty. If you just give a sideways glance to these ribs, the meat falls off the bone. Hands down the best rib eating experience I have ever had. Michelle, you were right....I was wrong. 

It's worth noting that for my second drink of the evening, I couldn't resist the \"Paper Bag Special\" for $1.95. While Culinary Dropout has a great beer selection, I just had to give this a try. In this case, it ended up being a can of PBR, delivered in a small brown paper bag. Several servers stopped by to marvel at my fine tastes....apparently, I was one of the first to go with this option. Michelle informed us that the actual beer offered as the \"Paper Bag Special\" will vary over time. So, you never know what you may get. I've never felt quite so classy. 

Lastly, I insisted we try the desert; specifically the Apple Monkey Bread, which Michelle described to us as \"cinnamon roll meets apple pie, served with a side of vanilla ice cream\". It is baked to order, so we had to wait for 15 minutes for it to arrive. When it did, it was hot and fresh.....my dining companions, who had eschewed desert, suddenly found room.....and it was devoured. 

All in all, a great dining experience. I am a fan of Sam Fox restaurants. Some I like better than others, but they all offer a unique and fun experience. Still, my expectations were exceeded by Culinary Dropout. This ones a real winner and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Unique gastropub this is not.  Any restaurant that needs to specifically state on it's website the following:
 \"the chefs on the line with silver-studded ears and mohawk hairdo, to the inked-up, decked-out bar staff mixologists shaking and stirring some of the most creative cocktails, we're all dropouts here.,\"
 I find to be totally ridiculous marketing nonsense.  Silly me, I didn't realize that those individuals with multiple earrings and tattoos should be considered dropouts.    In that case, I guess I should give up my M.S. degree and professional career because I have a lot of ear piercings and tattoos as well.  Now, onto the food.  I had the garden kale salad.  It was uninspired.  Nothing I couldn't have easily made at home and probably would have done a better job.  For an appetizer, I sampled the pretzels with the provolone fondue.  As expected, they were just as dull as they were when I tried them at sister restaurant Arrogant Butcher.  The atmosphere is loud and you can play games here.  I guess cause that is what dropouts do.  They have mohawks, mix drinks, and play ping pong.  Maybe its just me, but I just find it really stupid and annoying that Fox restaurant group specifically created a concept and restaurant idea based around this notion.  Instead of trying way too hard to be clever, I think they should focus on improving the mediocre service and the boring menu."}
{"text":"We had such a great time tonight... this is my new favorite place in Scottsdale! The service was great, the atmosphere on the patio was cozy and lively... and the food was amazing!! We shared the pretzel fondue, turkey pastrami sandwich and salads...My sisters agree, this will be the spot we'll come back to every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"First time here and loved it, great atmosphere, took advantage of their happy hour, amazing food. Conveniently located inside the hard rock hotel, gave 4 star instead of 5 because they don't offer wine on the happy hour drink list. Server Gary was great!"}
{"text":"We came here for Mother's Day and had made a reservation 2 weeks prior for our party of 13. They had us wait longer because they had our reservations set to only 10 people because they didn't think our entire party would show. Obviously if we made a reservation for 13 we would have them all accounted for. They even called two days beforehand to confirm that our party would still be coming. Our waiter was kind and patient with our party. Sometimes with this big of a party the service tends to not be its best. We appreciate that! The food was good. The crispy shrimp Caesar salad was a little too saucy for me (might want to ask for sauce on the side). The avocado toast breakfast also was a bit small and that's coming from my petite 90lbs sister."}
{"text":"Recently I had a very good experience with videographer Harold Adler of  Adler Videography/Photography. Based in Northern California and the Bay Area, he did some videos for my daughter's wedding. He was very nice to work with and produced a very  professional product. He loves to photograph weddings, Bar Mitzvahs and all types of parties and celebrations."}
{"text":"FOUR THUMBS UP!! my first time going here was on Halloween night..had a room and needed some grub! The waiter was really laid back but not like the rude lazy kind (I wish I remembered his name..maybe Anthony?) anywho, the portions were PERFECT and the food itself?? LAAWWDD!! It was amazingggg! I had the pub burger, my fiancé had the meatloaf.. Both to die for! Literally..aaaannnddd to top it off, the price was the next best part! My stomach and wallet were both very happy!"}
{"text":"I like it, but I don't love it... that's how I felt after leaving Culinary Dropout. Out of all the Fox restaurants I've been to this one isn't the worst, but not the best. I HATE True Food but LOVE the Arrogant Butcher. Culinary Dropout was somewhere in the middle with everything- service and food. Our server was OK, he was kinda slow in between courses and when we wanted to order, but since we were hangin' with friends it didn't matter too much. 

Of course the pretzel fondue is amazing. They weren't served as hot as at arrogant butcher, but still very good. I had a salad, which was fresh and the chicken I ordered on the top was REALLY good. It was grilled and full of flavor, which is sometimes lacking in chicken you get on top of a salad. Everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their food- I tried my Husband's grilled cheese sliders, which were greasy, but obviously good given its ingredients, however it didn't seem like enough food for a full meal. We skipped dessert and had foyo across the street. 

So in conclusion, if I was in the area and really had a taste for some pretzel fondue I would go back to Culinary Dropout.... although the pretzels and wetzels are better... now I'm confused..."}
{"text":"Hey hey hey Phoenix ,culinary dropout @ the yard is a must try! Great food, great atmosphere, great services , great live entertainment as well as outdoor games . Heads up ,call ahead for reservations and be prepared to valet park ,there is no other way to park . No worries it's complementary . As always if you go give it a try and let me know"}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely a staple for the Tempe area.  Whenever I have visitors in town, they always request to come here.  The atmosphere along with the food and drinks is a combination you cannot beat.  

If you go, you have to order the pretzel balls for an appetizer.  All of their food has very large portions, so make sure you go here with an appetite!  I would say this spot is perfect for a fun night you're looking to get out of the house and not cook!"}
{"text":"Really good, fresh food in a fun environment.  The service was very good and the food came out and was very tasty."}
{"text":"Had a large group (10 guys) attend a dinner Thursday night as party of a bachelor party. 

The restaurant could not have been more patient with the group as one of our two uber was sent to the wrong location. 

Food came out as fast as possible and the wait staff ensured we were well taken care of. 

Was the perfect location to kick off the night in old town from."}
{"text":"Pretzel bites are good, but the cheese fondue is just jarred cheese dip.  Was expecting better based on the reviews I read."}
{"text":"I hate to be mean and say that the name of this restaurant is so well deserved and it seems like the chef needed to stay and finish the culinary school.  Excellent fun atmosphere but the food is sub-par at best. There are many hit and misses. Meatloaf is slathered with sweetness and nothing like what mom makes. Fried chicken at $5 a piece is dry with heavy coating and once again sweet.  I know it is hot in phoenix but having so many customers fanning themselves from heat is not a good sign. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Whenever I get a chance to take a friend or family member to a new place I want to take them here for many reasons:

1. The atmosphere ROCKS. I love the green emerald chandeliers that line the dining room. The stage the live music plays on is cute and quaint. If you are sitting inside, the leather restoration hardware-ish couches are so plush and comfortable. If you are outside the wrap around couches and ambiance is great!

2. The fun drink menu - my husband is a beer enthusiast but still every time we are here he cannot help himself but ordering the brown bag special for $1.50! He loves playing the guessing game of what awful beer will be in the bag! Who cars if its a nasty beer he says for $1.50 its worth it!  I happen to be a fan of the blueberry beer myself!

3. The FOOD - I love the meat and cheese small eats menu.. the jamon iberico meat is WORTH the $13, just trust me. Its a black hoofed pig from Europe. If you were to order this meat from a butcher it would run you about $138 a pound which is why the small portion you get is $13 but it is AMAZING and the only place in town that I know serves it. Order that along with the goat cheese and you will be in heaven! For the main course, you have to absolutely order the prime rib dip. God, I am craving one right now! The meat is so tender you do not even have to chew. The bread is so soft and the provolone cheese adds a perfect touch. They serve it with French Onion Soup to dip your sandwich in which adds a great compliment to the sandwich! 

There are many things on this menu to satisfy just about everyone. My only complaint is there can be a super super long wait at times and ordering a drink can be a pain but other than that this is my favorite among the Fox Concept Restaurant chain!"}
{"text":"Good clean food in a Vegas casino? Look no further than the kale and butternut squash salad here. Add smoked salmon and I'm in heaven! And a side of the amazing toasted on the grill ciabatta with a balsamic drizzle. Yum and yum."}
{"text":"Shared the split chicken dinner meal. My first piece was very tender the split chicken was kinda dry. Very cool atmosphere and the live music was great.

I decided to change my star status! Amazing customer service and response time. Thank you for valuing your customers and wanting to make things right. That speaks volumes!!!"}
{"text":"Really unique menu. The sea salt pretzels and provolone fondue as appetizers were very delicious. Fresh baked pretzel buns. Live acoustic music (2 members of authority zero to be exact) added to the ambiance. Loved the experience, would def come back. Only downside was how loud the guests were. Service was on point."}
{"text":"Loved this place!   Excellent costumer service!   Great food and drinks, too!   We had their prime rib french dip,  which is by far the best french dip I've ever had!  We will definitely hit this place up next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the pretzel and cheese fondu! The fried chicken and crispy shrimp Caesar salad were AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This is the go-to place in Tempe if you want a laid back place to eat & drink, while avoiding the college-y Mill Ave vibe.

The soft pretzel balls with cheese fondue are a MUST. Everyone I know raves about how they could drink the cheese because it is just that delicious.

Other items on the menu that I would recommend are the pub burger and the sweet corn cannelloni. The one thing I would not recommend is the ramen - it was pretty bland, didn't have shrimp as advertised, and when I asked for Sriracha to jazz it up, I never received any. That was probably more of a miss on my server's part though.

There is tons of space for activities, so it is GREAT for large groups. But heads up: if you go to the back area near where the games are you can only order from a limited food menu."}
{"text":"Fri noon lunch... I'd come back again for sure.

Memorable cocktails: Smashed Irishman and Hijinx and Rye... Just my style, too: decently strong but balanced.

Impressive flavors: Turkey Pastrami (i hate turkey but she brought a sample of it and i was sold)... The blended if the flavor of the bread, the slaw, the turkey was impressive. The HH Antipasti was big for the HH price and had good qty of olives, Marcona almonds, prosciutto, etc.

Great service: she was upbeat, friendly, quick, no annoying water refill interruptions, got me a sampler of something i was hesitant about (turkey pastrami)

Location: easy parking, some construction currently in the area but still easy to access lot.

Ambiance: very open area, good music level, crowd noise is acceptable level, comfortable seating, looks clean and modern."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. The cannelloni and sherry beets. DELICIOUS!!!  Loved it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would say that this place is ok.. The atmosphere was pretty cool.. Loud with the live music and the tvs all on. The service was ok.. Very casual with everything. Food was pretty good. We had the soft pretzels & provolone fondue.. This was really good, A little too much sea salt on the pretzels but it was still really good. We also had the 36-hour pork ribs and the fried chicken, both were pretty good. Those two plates had pretty large portions so if your not a big eater I would share it with someone. 
Only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I felt like it was a little overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Wow, MAKE THIS A MUST VISIT. I wasn't sure what I expected, the food choices in the Hard Rock haven't been that great, but suffice it to say, we were blown away.  GREAT Service!  Tasty craft cocktails, innovative and interesting menu and comfortable surroundings!  We can't wait to go back!  This place is similar to yardbird But Like five million times better. If you have a choice, make this your stop

Jambalaya rocks!  The trout was cooked perfectly and awesome!  All of the apps were tasty and the cheeses available were surprisingly good for a casual restaurant.  You have to order the Pretzel bites...HAVE TOO.

Only wish I had ordered the chicken, next time for sure!  We were so crazy on Apps and meals that we didn't have room for desert either.

Great job!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. My first visit was kind of average. We did enjoy good food and good drinks but my most recent visit was amazing.

This place might get better the more you visit... which I plan to do again!

My husband and I arrived and were greeted by a friendly hostess who gave us a sitting promptly. They were busy but can accommodate customers inside and out.

The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. I didn't hear any servers apologizing to nearby tables for mistakes and people genuinely appeared to be enjoying their time.

We didn't make it up to the bar or outside. I would like to do so on the next visit though. I'm not sure if the outside games are first come first serve or reserve but we are interested in returning to find out.

Now for the food! I had the BEST honey fried chicken and delicious coleslaw. My husband ordered tacos and they were also scrumptious. We both liked our meals so much that we decided to share half and half. We went here more than a week ago and he's still recommending to others to go try the fried chicken. He says, \"It was the best fried chicken I have ever had!\"

We started our meal with hummus and ended it with a baked apple desert. Everything we had was delicious and every drink was yummy. Our server, Manu, was very attentive and made sure we had whatever we needed. He managed to keep all his tables happy. He really did his best to keep us happy but balanced it well with allowing us privacy.

This visit has us wanting to return for more! As long as they keep that chicken filled with honey, I will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite spots to eat, hang out, and spend time with friends and family in Tempe. For reference, I took my dad here, who is a French-trained professional chef and never has much to say about the restaurants I take him, and he was all about it. Huge kudos to Culinary Dropout for delivering. 

The grounds are gigantic, as this location has a Yard attached to it. The nice thing is that this place is always busy but never really feels crowded. Take a seat at one of their expensive-looking couches, chairs, and tables. 

From the several times I've eaten here, I've had the fried chicken, ribs, the antipasti plate, gorg chicken salad, Italian chopped salad, and the pastrami. I have never been disappointed or felt like I should've ordered something else. Though I have to say that I am a huge fan of their salads. 

Really no need to talk up the bar at all because it has everything that a craft beer lover like myself is into."}
{"text":"While the food at Fox restaurants is always good this location, on a slow afternoon, had very poor and indifferent service.  We were made to feel unwelcome and as if the staff could not be bothered despite the place being almost empty.  I will continue to dine at Fox places but not this location"}
{"text":"Had dinner here. Yea it hard rocks. 

Overall the dinner meñu is not too extreme but the food is still at to above average but the phenomenal drinks, trendy vibes, and super friendly service totally make it worth it. 

I actually enjoyed the pretzel cheese fondue but the burrata, that was amazeballs. It's a semi soft slightly sweet cheese with chimichurri and marinated tomatoes. It's like a Spanish version of a bruschetta. Definitely try it. 

The fried chicken is phenom... Hang on to the cheese from the pretzel fondue, it's good for dippin!  I had the pork belly sandwich and it was thick cut, juicy, and tender. 

Favorite drinks: honestly I'm more of a red ale, malbec, and straight up martini kind of guy, but this is one place I have ventured a bit... At least so far as trying everyone else's drinks. That counts!

Drunken Irishmen, clown punch, malbec. YUM"}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to downtown Tempe. Watched the AZ Cardinals game, they actually play game sound in the back bar. The menu is different from the Camelback location, but still fantastic. There is so much space for large groups and games. Will absolutely be returning - try the Shrimp & Pork Belly Ramen, delicious :)"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants far as lunch! I'm always excited to have \"Gina\" as our waitress!
She is so Attentive, Prompt, Courteous and Cheerful! 

She is very knowledgeable of the menu and what we might enjoy to eat. The food menu is so good, the atmosphere is spacious and a bit intimate!

I hope Gina is give the opportunity to work her way up into Hospitality Management she's just simply the best!!! Looking forward to eating here again maybe dinner...."}
{"text":"Yumm! I was fortunate to be invited to their VIP soft opening last night. Sam, the owner was so sweet and comped the girls and I an amazing meal and drinks! Thank you Sam! ;) I will upload a pic.

Their cocktail menu is fun and varied! I forgot the name of my cocktail but it was made with champagne and ginger, delish!

We unleashed our inner fat girls, and at Sam's recommendation, ordered a variety of menu items:

Raw Bar:
-Oysters
-Black mussels
-King Crab Legs

Appetizers:
-Artichoke
-Pretzel bread and cheese fondue
-Gorgonzola chicken salad

Entrees:
-Salmon with apples
-Rainbow trout
-36 hour ribs

Dessert:
-Apple Monkey Bread

WOW everything so good!! My favorite bites were the selections from the raw bar, especially the black mussles, the broth was so flavorful! I also really liked the 36 hour ribs, the sauce was so rich and delicious.

That said, I think the best bite of the night was the apple monkey bread. It came in a cast iron skillet with a scoop of ice cream on the side. If your favorite cinnamon roll and your favorite bread pudding had a love child, it would be Culinary Dropout's apple monkey bread!

Service was fantastic, we had numerous waiters and staff being very attentive to us.

I can't wait to come back, thank you again for treating us so well Sam! xoxo"}

{"text":"Culinary Dropout is in the Hard Rock Hotel. My GF and I went there on a whim today for some lunch. We were not dressed up and we were hungover, but we decided to go in anyway. My brother frequents this place in Arizona, so we had some ideas about what to order. We started out with the pretzel bites with provolone cheese fondue. I highly recommend this appetizer, the only downside is that I filled up and could not finish my pub burger. The burger was exactly what I was looking for, gastropub style with lots of flavor. I was sad that I could not finish it. My GF got the breakfast burrito, which was fantastic. For drinks I had The After School Special. Thumbs up in my book. The girlfriend had the bottomless mimosas, can't go wrong there. We had our service dog with us, the staff was more than friendly with him being with us ( I know it's a law that an establishment can't discriminate, but trust me, it happens) We sat on the patio and had our drinks while watching the staff shave their Mo-vember mustaches off. Great people watching. Our waiter Shaun, was not only a great server, but a great human being. He talked with us for a long time and made us feel right at home. I really liked this place and will be back. Next time you are at Hard Rock, skip the gross restaurant Pink Taco, and head into Culinary Dropout. Look for the tattooed server named Shaun, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Interesting place
I have been twice.
It is really interesting and the place is enormous.
The food is good but a bit pricy for what you get.
Seems a tad over priced but the size and uniqueness of the place is part of that price I'm sure.

I will be going from time to time"}

{"text":"Happy New Year! Well, it's official - January has flown by and I'm not even sure where time is going!! I hope everyone had a great celebration to ring in the New Year. My husband and I dined at Culinary Dropout on NYE to take advantage of their amazing three course meal.

We went straight into \"treat-yo-self\" mode when we got there and started off with Korean Style Brussels Sprouts and the Bacon & Parmesan Grissini from their Antipasti menu. My husband found the Brussels Sprouts to be his favorite item the entire night; I was on board with the Grissini which were basically really long breadsticks (not sure how to describe them)!

For our main meal, I went with the Smoked Salmon Toast / Fried Chicken / Apple Crisp. My husband went with Sweet Potato Pierogis / Fried Chicken / S'mores dessert.

It was kind of difficult to pick which of the starters we liked more, both were good in different ways! I actually preferred the Pierogis because the dish was a little bit of sweet & salty but the Smoked Salmon Toast had a good flavor also. Now, my husband and I typically don't get the same entree when we go to a restaurant so we can share but if there's one place to do it, it would be at Culinary Dropout - their fried chicken is always super crunchy and tasty. No regrets on this choice! Both desserts were good but if I had to pick again, I'd go with the S'mores; it was very rich & decadent but amazing. I'm typically not a huge chocolate person but I really enjoyed this dessert!

Overall, a great meal. We did go early in the evening with a reservation so we were seated immediately. They have a nice bar area plus games if you're waiting for your table and have some time. I'll go ahead and keep my rating at 4 stars after multiple visits!"}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was even better!
I tried the pub burger and had a banana pie for dessert!It was cooked perfect I will def come back here again!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was pretty standard for a gastropub. I had the fish n chips and it was solid. The atmosphere was nice as well. There was a pretty good beer selection. However the service was really lousy. Our waitress stopped by twice over the course of an hour and 10 minutes. We evetually just started walking up to the bar for our own drinks. It wasn't too busy so I'm not sure what was going on. Price was pretty high too for what you are getting. I'd skip this place and head to four peaks."}
{"text":"I think I would have a given Culinary Dropout 5 stars had I reviewed it after my first visit - during which I had the delectable patrale (sp??) sole roasted tomatoes and asparagus and the  HEAVENLY monkey bread for dessert... I was also tipsy on maybe 3 vodka sodas so the 1 hour wait didn't bother me either...

but after I came back to the second time I was like eh... the food was less than what I remembered - this time I had the french onion soup and a salad and the cougar-ish ambiance was beginning to annoy me...

I must admit  though that the waitresses are AMAZING! during both visits - they were VERY accommodating, first to my dairy-challenged husband and second time to my vegan friend where they modified the chicken salad by adding more veggies and taking the chicken out so she can eat it.

Plus its priced moderately... money tawks!!!"}
{"text":"Popped in for dinner here during work travel and not sure I can add much to what has already been said. Very lively place that serves up some excellent food. We rolled in on a Tuesday and were told an hour wait for a table so after hovering like vultures for 15 mins, my boss and I grabbed a couple of seats at the bar. I will say the charcuterie was one of the highlights as their were so many choices to build your own board and the 10 items we chose were all excellent and there are about 30 things to choose from. Cocktails were on point too. Definitely recommend this place and would come back again. Rachel, here's your Yelp, girl! Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"This is my third time coming to Culinary Dropout and it just keeps on getting better. This place is always my first stop when I'm in Arizona. The Tempe location is the place to be."}
{"text":"Good food but very loud! My girlfriend and I went there for dinner we were't sure what we wanted.  They don't have a large menu (usually a good thing).  I had the broiled fish which was very good.  My friend ordered the hamburger which she said was very good. Having a conversation is nearly impossible."}
{"text":"I went there on a Thursday evening around 5:30pm.  It wasn't all that packed and I was seated by the kitchen in the back against the wall looking out.  It was a sunny evening.  When I first heard of the name, I thought, wow, people who dropout of the culinary school must all go there.  I was totally kidding with that remark.

My date and I ordered Chips & Dip, it was homemade chips, not too salty and not too oily, which was great because I didn't want my fingers to be all greasy and sticky; We also had Korean Chicken & Shrimp on sticks, it doesn't have the flavor of being a Korean food and it tasted blend; Their HH food and drink items are just $3, it's totally worth the buck.  And the beer came in a small cute glass, it will definitely fill you up.

Our server was Benjamin, he's service was excellent.  If you aren't sure what to order, make sure you ask him as he'll tell you what's good and what's not so good.  Try it out the next time you are in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner the other night while I was in Scottsdale.  I ordered the meatloaf, which came with mashed potatoes and gravy and green beans.  The meatloaf was tender and had great flavor.  It was the right amount of food and I'd order it again in a heartbeat.  Another solid meal."}
{"text":"This would have been a five star review if we were going off of how delicious the food was because it is mighty tasty. But, the server we had was just rude. There were 7 in our party and 2 were from out of town and we wanted to take them somewhere with a fun atmosphere and great food. Our server, upon arrival, seemed annoyed with us. The entire time we were there he seemed bothered if we needed anything. The real problem was one of out of town guests ordered a second drink that she never received after asking more then once. He brought the bill having charged her for the second drink and we brought it to his attention he made it seem as if the fault was ours. I get that the vibe of the staff is chill and cool but maybe they should put more effort into customer service instead of the way they look"}
{"text":"First impressions last the longest.  This was our first time there.  We were impressed with the atmosphere...very \"hip\" (and loud) indeed.  

Our server came to our table...he could have been a homeless person for all we knew...bearded out, tattooed, gadged earrings, and a nose ring that told us he was a rebel and perhaps did some prison time?  Rad.  He took our drink orders. Came back with our drinks and my date and I asked for straws...came back with un-covered straws.  What I mean by that is he came back with straws that were open to the elements.  Whatever.  I put my straw in and took my first sip of Water and to my dismay, tasted something sweet on my straw.  It appeared that something was on my straw!  Was it our servers sticky fingers?  I wasn't thirsty anymore.  Diner's beware, ask for a straw with caution. Drink responsibly. 

We ordered the pretzel fondue for starters.  Very good. (Thanks Yelpers)  Asked the server for suggestions as to what was good there and he basically read the menu...thanks man....not helpful but thanks anyway.  It was then that I decided that it was my goal to see if I could make him smile or show some sort of human emotion  (I failed...). He was a bit of a harda$$.  Hard to crack but he was \"hip\"...fitting place for him to work. I ordered the ribs.  \"36hrs\" of something enticed me to get them.  Meh. They were boiled and had a decent sauce in them.  Nothing special.  My date got the fried chicken.   She offered a bite, I took a bite and grease poured out. Nasty.  That just tells me the oil used hasn't been changed for a while.  Mmmm...tasty. 

Overall, great place to drink and people watch.  The Scottsdale crowd is great to entertain us people watchers.  Food and straws are funky.  For that I give them two stars. Maybe that's why their called \"culinary dropout\"."}
{"text":"Nice place! Cool staff, great food. We loved the crispy shrimp Caesar salad! Yummmmers"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch staple. Always a high level of service and atmosphere. The hostess/wait staff are laid back yet phenomenal at their job and you can tell that the food is made with precision for quality. Great tap-beer variety and they serve probably the greatest appetizer in the world: Soft Pretzel bread rolls with provolone fondue."}
{"text":"Tempe, Arizona

Out of towner's perspective.  The vibe and service were 5-star.  Seemed to be a very 'Trendy' place with a lot of pretty people if you know what I mean.  Being a loner I sat at the bar where I was served by several barkeeps. All were excellent.  

My food was really pretty good as well.  I had some of the mix and match anti-pasta items and the Korean Endcap.  Both very good."}
{"text":"Waitress Megan, better known as Dance, was the best part of dinner. She's a five (actually a ten, but that's a different scale).

Place was nice enough, and we sat outside with a nice breeze that was delightful.

Food was definitely, as the Yelp two star review puts it, \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" It wasn't bad, just nothing special."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance! Chic! Unique! Cozy! Comfortable! 

 The service was impeccable! Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. He had tons of recommendations and he was honest about menu items.

The food was just okay. We ordered the pretzel bites which I thoroughly enjoyed but the $22 chicken while flakey and tender, lacked seasoning. We also ordered the $14 BBQ pork belly nachos which most individuals would enjoy...I was too excited while ordering and overlooked the \"BBQ\" part. I'm not a fan of mixing BBQ and nachos! Just a personal preference. We also tried the $10 monkey bread and ice cream for dessert. I would have preferred the bread to be a little softer but it was flavorful and served HOT out of the oven.

An enjoyable experience but we won't be returning. Too many other restaurants to try in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The service was OK it could've been a little bit better.  Staff seem to be a little bit behind. We didn't receive any napkins or cutlery until a 10 minutes after we received our food.  I did not lower the stars for the service.

My wife and I ordered sweet peppers which were good.  The Thai chile chicken wings were very tasty.  My wife order the Garden Kale and I ordered the Pub burgers. Both of these dishes we're mediocre in my opinion.  That is the reason I gave this place 4 stars.  You should still visit this establishment because they do have a wide variety of dishes."}
{"text":"The pretzel rolls and fondue! This gets 5 stars for that alone. But honestly all the food we have tried has been delicious. Played ping pong while waiting for food. Fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The soft pretzel and provolone cheese fondue is a must get appetizer. Good size, plenty of pretzels for a group of 4. The cheese isn't too sharp or harsh, great complement to the pretzels. The pretzels are almost like rolls, tender and satisfying. 

Drink: Deviant Behavior. Fruity and not syrupy sweet, can't taste the alcohol at all, I could easily drink this too fast. They give you the rest of the can of beer... which is great but I wish they would refill the strawberry and lemon too. 

I got the prime rib dip sandwich and wasn't thrilled. Good roll, tender meat, but not exciting. Just meat, bread and cheese, good basic sandwich. My sister in law got the fried chicken, I wish I got that. It was crispy and juicy and the honey was a good touch. 

Great place for groups but very loud, you'll have to shout to hear each other."}
{"text":"Did a date night here last night and it was amazing!!  From the service to the atmosphere and of course the food!! We started with the pretzels and fondue cheese dip and meat and cheese board..... yummmm!  For dinner we had the garden kale salad which was insanely good (I could eat salad everyday if it always tasted this good) and the butternut squash cannelloni with steak and it was honestly the best thing I have ever had!   The flavors were sweet and perfectly savory.  Finished the night with the banana cream pie which was also amazing! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"What Culinary Dropout is NOT good for:

- High Expectations - You have to take this place for what it really is... a gastropub. Not a restaurant dining destination.
- The Menu - Don't come here if you're looking to be wowed by the food.
- Special Dinners - Don't come here for special occasions unless your looking for a bar atmosphere with bar quality service. 
- The Wait - Don't come here past 7pm wanting a table unless you don't mind a lengthy wait, so plan on hanging around in the crowded waiting area/bar for over an hour.

What Culinary Dropout IS good for:

- The Bar - Consider CD a bar, not a restaurant... so pass on a table and gab a seat at the bar! It's 10x more fun and the service is excellent!
- The Atmosphere - Friendly, fun and a seen and be seen kind of bar. It's the perfect spot for a night out with a group of friends. Inside, the décor is a funky and fresh combination of chandeliers and textured walls with a mix matched assortment of tables/chairs. 
- The Patio - Comfortable seating and fun people watching near Fashion Square Mall. It's a prime hot spot location.
- It's absolutely perfect for day drinking.
- An excellent place to watch a sports game! 
- Bar food - As far as bar food goes, CD does not disappoint. Yeah the food is average if you compare it to a restaurant. But compared to other bar menus... CD's menu rocks! Try the ahi salad & the trout.
- Great drink selections. Get the acai mojito and try out the paper bag special! And if you love bloody mary's you've got to try theirs because they infuse their vodka with bacon!
- The pricing matches the quality of the food & drinks. Don't forget that even though it's a glorified bar, it's still one of Sam's Foxy spots."}
{"text":"Francesca was a great server but the food on the other hand was not good. The 2 stars go to our server , and the pretzels and provolone fondue. The deviled eggs with prosciutto were seriously the worst deviled eggs I have EVER had. Along with the crusty bread with olive oil and balsamic. I thought you would get bread with an olive oil/balsamic mixture on a separate plate with herbs and they just drizzle the balsamic and olive oil across the bread. Not only did it hurt the top of my mouth, it just wasn't good. I probably won't ever come back here."}
{"text":"Went here for a business meeting and it was nice. Okay, okay... it was FUN and not much of a business meeting. How many smiles can an actual business meeting generate? Apparently, more than I can count. The food was good, the scene was cool and very entertaining, service just okay though. If there was another business meeting there I wouldn't complain."}
{"text":"Pulled Pork nachos are the best!!!! Get them during happy hour. Drinks are a bit pricey but that's comes with the great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome! Great ambience! Great food! Love the concept here. Good food too! Loved the pretzel rolls and fondue!"}
{"text":"The menu at culinary dropout is simple, but doesn't limit customers to a variety of tastes. The atmosphere was very nice and relaxing. My girlfriend and I ordered the meatloaf, which was absolutely delicious, easily the best I've ever had. We ordered some appetizers and they were all very flavorful; I particularly enjoyed the pork belly. They also have an extensive drink menu. Overall the prices were reasonable and I had a great experience there. Only complaint was that our table was crooked so it shook a little and the tables with the decorative chairs are uncomfortable if you are shorter or like to lounge."}
{"text":"So we stopped in for a quick bite to eat! Ended up getting Turkey Pastrami on their homemade Pretzel Roll! Great selection on this one! Turkey Pastrami was a Pastrami seasoned turkey breast just spiced enough to give it the Pastrami Flavor and was heated but yet moist like a well prepared Turkey breast! Their signature pretzel roll.  Our server Barry (new) did a great job! The modern atmosphere with rustic touches gave a nice want to Party touch! 
Recommend coming here on a visit to Vegas they do have a Raw Bar on site!
May have to try the dinner menu on another trip!"}
{"text":"Very good food, great casual atmosphere, and excellent staff service. Great place to come and watch a game with some friends."}
{"text":"Hit or miss! the days they are on the ball food is fantastic and i would give them 4 stars 
tho the last few times i have been in food has been a bust, service has always been good and the managers are always prompt if there is a problem, this place has always been great to get some great late night food ,i dont know what has happened recently, food had been cold, over done, not fresh made, they have run out of things, and not said anything, 
come on Culinary get yourself together you act as if you dont care anymore, and that is restaurant suicide in arizona, the minute you dont care is when you go no matter the money one has backing you, 
many times people would ask me where to go for late night food i would say here, as in my mind they sat at a solid four,now i can not say that as it has slipped to a 2.5 maybe 3stars. and i do noy  want to run a risk of someone blaming me for a poor recomendation
yelp doesnt allow half stars otherwise   i would do 2.5 stars allas 3 stars will do as ¡ i rounded up for the amazing bartenders and servers that do care !"}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey but I think it's worth it.

The pretzel and fondue deal is pretty legit. And they are well known for it. 

One thing I do hate about this place and all the eateries in the hard rock is you have to walk into the lobby to use the restroom. It's a pain.

Either way this place is a great little spot and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to Culinary Dropout a couple of times; the first time I took it as a fluke since the service was so poor, but after another experience that was similar, I'd say it was not a fluke.

The first time we went in we opted to just sit at the bar & have drinks & dessert. No one was attentive; we had to flag down the bartender to take our order & get our check. Additionally, I got a lot of attitude when I told them that I didn't really like the dessert. Overall, it was just a blah experience, especially considering how much we paid for our order.

The second time we went, the service was a little better than the first time. We sat down for dinner & ordered the mac burger & the fried chicken. The coleslaw which came with the fried chicken wasn't very good; if ordered again, I'd get just the chicken with mashed potatoes & gravy. The mac burger was large & my date seemed to enjoy it.

Overall, however, I find that there's nothing great about the meal or the experience when dining at this restaurant. I understand there might be other meals that are worth the money but as I've experienced it, I can't justify going back & getting $16 fried chicken & mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Great location and cool building. But you still have to eat!! Most average food of all the Sam Fox restaurants I have been to!!"}
{"text":"Such a lovely restaurant. The food is AMAZING. Every time I have been here the food has been wonderful. The fries are cut fresh and are to die for. I crave this place all the time!"}
{"text":"We attended the 4-course beer pairing and I highly recommend it.  The service was amazing and fast.  The pairing experience lasted about 2 hours and you are seating with other diners at a table that seats 16 people so you have an opportunity to really interact with the other diners which for us made the experience more fun.  If you are not a social butterfly this type of dining experience may not be for you.
During the pairing the beer representative made his rounds explaining what we were drinking and the history behind the beer and how it is made.  The chef also made his rounds after each course was served to give us the ingredients and techniques used.  Overall a great experience, plenty of service and we didn't have to do anything.  The only things that could have been a little different was the lighting was very dim so reading about our experience or reviewing the catalogs that were on the table was difficult and it was at times difficult to hear what was being said over the restaurant and other patron noise."}
{"text":"While visiting town from the foodie capital of the the country (Portland), I decided to try this place out. I had lived in Phoenix for twenty years and was familiar with the Sam Fox concept restaurants. Culinary Dropout is a hybrid of Sauce and The Arrogant Butcher, which was disappointing. Many menu items were identical and in a tragic twist of fate, less tasty than I remembered. 

Our service was lackluster. The server was either overwhelmed or just not interested in her job that night. 

The pretzel fondue was great. The chicken gorgonzola salad lacked both the meat and cheese it promised to deliver. 

The restaurant itself is a great venue to meet friends and have a great night out. Tempe has always been a town with hit and miss service."}
{"text":"Very cool space and vibe....add great food and you can't go wrong.  Live acoustic music on Sundays is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday.... This place is pretty cool... Pricey but cool.

I just love the set up and the food was delicious!

We were stationed in the middle area in between the main dining room and the area where they amhad ping pong and corn holes. There was a big group of us in the couches and chairs.

That night was freezing and the outside heaters kept us warm... I just wish they had a bigger area to eat out food because our table had a bonfire type thing in the middle and my fave felt like it was melting when I was eating my food lol.

I got the chicken sandwich and it was sooooo good! I was very happy with it... And my friend got the ravioli... She let me try some of it and I wanna go back and order some for myself! The PaB buger was delicious too!

I was very happy with the food and the atmosphere...plus our server was very good at keeping track of all our orders throughout the night :)

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The Fox management commented on my post offering to make up for my awful experience. I emailed her back right away and I never heard back from them. So, if you see them claiming to make up for awful reviews, just know it's probably just to look nice on the Yelp page. They're not going to make up for it."}
{"text":"I have never been here before.  I had lunch today at this location and will say it is pretty good.  I ordered the shaved beef sandwich.  It was really good.  The house fries were okay, but I will get another side next time.  The au jus was really tasty too.  I like this place and recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Service is why 3 stars .  My kale salad was amazing, but, my order included two appetizers that didn't come out.  When I mentioned the mistake there was a sincere apology, everyone makes mistakes, and they were brought out after the salad.  Which kinda ruined it for me.  I am going to give it another go next time I am in town and maybe only order appetizers and small bites.  The selection is large and could be very satisfying.  But, kudos on the kale salad nonetheless."}
{"text":"I came here expecting overpriced average tasting food. Well half of my thoughts proved true. Foods pricey but was better than average. We ordered the $22 fried chicken and the $18? French dip sand. They were both very good but my partner was taken aback by how good the gravy on his mashed potatoes were. He even asked me to try them knowing I despise gravy AND mashed potatoes. But I tried anyways and even I thought it was okay. The fried chicken was awesome in my opinion. 

I ordered The Room Service cocktail and yum!! I loved it and at the time said it was the best is ever had. Everything I like in one drink. 

Plus my server was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Meh! Culinary dropouts is a perfect description. Look there is a reason to eat here but it's not the food. The atmosphere  is wonderful. Sat on the patio and enjoyed the service and breeze off the pool. 

We had the pretzel knots - good, large, salty, fondue was a little cold and cooled even faster. 

The pork belly nachos minus the pork, if you can call it that. It was really chopped ham in some kind of bbq sauce, more cold fondue, some beans scattered about. Smaller portions than you would expect. 

And the fried chicken. Salty, like really salty. Biscuit was over cooked. Mashed potatoes were more salt. 

I think the alcohol is why people come to hang out. Not the food. 

Our server I have to say was brilliant. Pleasant, likable, worth a star all by herself."}
{"text":"Sooooooo.....goooooood! Drinks were great. Recommend the soiled dove for the drink. It has hints of BlackBerry and a luscious taste of grape fruit. Great balance of sweet and tequila. Fried chicken is to die for. Crispy on the outside with a splash of honey and the inside is nice and juicy cooked to perfection. The black muscles were great. Nice balance of beer and garlic. Totally recommend this place for food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks. Classic decor with a modern touch makes for a welcoming atmosphere. Spicy cocktails are"}
{"text":"Two trends that need to end.  ASAP.  Really, ahorita:

1.  Bacon mixed with everything under the sun.  Bacon doesn't need an accompaniment, it's amazing all on its own.  No more bacon donuts.  Please, for the love.

2.  Overuse of truffle oil.  Dumping truffle oil on a dish does not make it gourmet.  Please stop.  For real.

Culinary Dropout is guilty of succumbing to these two trends.  That being said, the service and atmosphere make it forgivable.  Our server and the manager were hyper aware of how long we'd been waiting.  Even though it was not that big of a deal to us, it was nice to know they cared.

They mean well when it comes to cocktails, but they were a little lightweight for me, relying heavily on simple syrup and mixers to dumb down the alcohol.  Their beer list made up for it, though.  I've never had a stout in a can, but they managed to find the brewery that pulled it off.

Yeah, my ricotta gnocchi was drenched in truffle oil, but the sausage and mushrooms made it actually a pretty good dish.  And the beets were fresh and delicious.

I liked it, I'm not gonna lie, but I wish they'd stop falling prey to the trends and branch out a bit.  Culinary Dropout, you're better than that."}
{"text":"Ample seating indoors and outdoors. We even saw a huge 20+ group assembling indoors. Outdoor seating affords the view and music of Rehab when it's underway without the admission fee. We sat outdoors but not in one of those super comfy looking tall lounge chairs you wouldn't expect outside. We even saw a wedding party taking their wedding photos there! 
The menu is varied from standard American, to seafood. Prices tend to be typical of on-the-strip in-hotel Vegas restaurants. Our waitresss, Taylor, was very accommodating with our orders. Decent ever-changing draft beer selection but champagne selection was limited."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere and design of this place. Live music playing in an open air dining and bar setup. We ordered the nachos and seared tuna salad and both were delicious. Staff was very cordial and friendly. Would recommend for anyone looking for a laid back and casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. However the nachos did feel a little bland. Environment was not bad. Staff was friendly, didn't really enjoy their drinks though."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast recently.  Place looks cool, but the food was incredibly bland. The smoked salmon hash browns looked great, but had absolutely no flavor.  The egg white scramble was passable, but still very forgettable.   Also tried 2 of their breakfast cocktails, which were awful.  Bacon Bloody Mary was just some tomato juice with a piece of bacon in it.  The Red Rooster Bloody Mary had cheese bits floating in it, and had some gross sweetness to it.  Very nice waitress offered to swap out the drinks, but that was the only high point."}
{"text":"This place is trendy and fun and has decent food....IF you ever get served. I ordered the pretzel fondue one hour ago (yes, I'm currently here on Saturday afternoon). Still no fondue despite asking bartender 3 times. I also ordered the most delicious spring veggie salad about 35 minutes ago (thinking it would come quicker) but still NO food. And I finished my drink 20 minutes ago and no one has asked if I want another. There are 5-6 bartenders and the bar isn't that packed. What gives??? Oh, and let me mention that others at the bar who ordered after me are already done with their food. And let me make clear: neither my dining companion nor I are ugly or rude!!!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to come and try this place based on the reviews. Sadly, I never got to eat. We were seated and had no one waiting on us for 25 minutes, so we left. People who came in after us were seated and provided with drinks. The wait staff walked by several times and no one stopped to take an order. 

I never write bad reviews, but I was certain to write one today due to the horrible service."}
{"text":"Great date spot. Games such as corn-hole, ping pong and chess in the back and modern but casual dining area in the front. Also comfy outside seating available. I've never eaten anything here that wasn't delicious. 

Definitely reserve a spot on either the Open Table app or call ahead or you'll be waiting forever on the weekends. 

Kid of expensive but you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"We have corporate events here every other week. NO MORE! Some random person knocked into one of my employees and the manager decided to cut our corporate event off. Very disappointed in Sam Fox. We will find another establishment who would appreciate our $3500 every week."}
{"text":"Now, a somewhat dinner review.

My out of town visitor said she wanted a place like Buffalo Wild Wings, but better. And she wanted beer. I said...ok. Culinary Dropout it is.

Last night, we were promptly seated, ordered our beverages, and then got the pretzels and cheese fondue. Absolutely amazing. As always. It was my day off from the gym, so I said...\"What the hell!\"

Instead of ordering entrees, we decided to order a place of prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes, and some manchego cheese, served with crostinis.

Everything was flavorful. The sun dried tomatoes were perfectly marinated, the manchego was at just the right temperature, and the prosciutto was finely sliced like a delicate piece of angel paper. What the hell is angel paper? I have no idea. I am just free-writing. Go with it.

Bottom line, you will never go wrong here. Appetizers, Entrees, Charcuterie....anything. This is your spot. 

Service is a tad spotty in the evening, but I suppose that CAN be a good thing if you are in a good conversation."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! We had lots of fun!  We even met the Manager, Clancy.  Awesome guy!  I highly recommend Culinary Dropout!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried it a few times now.  Had too, \"Team Lunchs\",  I don't care for it.. Just trying to be safe with a burger, but Under Sized and always Dry,,,"}
{"text":"We brought four hungry children at 930pm after swimming all day. They accommodated our needs and offered the kids a special plate of pretzels and macaroni. The live music was awesome and the environment was great. The service topped it off. Great place!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp Caesar and my wife had a turkey sandwich. 

The salad - for the greens it was what appeared to be iceberg and kale. The kale was okay, the iceberg was inedible. It was all these gross corner pieces that basically wasted half of the salad. 

The sandwich - it had almost no flavor and the bun was hard. 

Seems to be all hype and no substance.."}
{"text":"We ate here with customers this night.  This place is good.  The service seemed a little out of sync to us.  The food was good.  I think I had the French dip sandwich with slaw.  We had a pretzel appetizer given to us by mistake and it was good.  The chips that were house made we so so.  I would try them again because homemade chips depend on different things.  The pork belly nachos were really good too.  I like pork belly a lot and so did my guests with me.    

This place is loud.  My hearing is so so and understanding the server was a challenge at times. Could be a reason why things seem out of sync also. I did notice the patio when leaving and will sit there next time.  That way I can hear better."}
{"text":"I have always been really impressed by the Culinary Drop out but our waiter tonight made it a heck of a lot better. I am lactose intolerant and he made navigating the menu super easy and ask the chefs if they could make it lactose free. They were incredibly accommodating and kind. It was wonderful."}
{"text":"had the fish and chips.  Great crunch descent flavor.  Fries were good and the grilled cheese was tasty.  Glad I tried."}
{"text":"Recently I took a day trip to Phoenix with my hubby. We stopped here for an early dinner around 4:30pm on a Friday. Staff was very friendly. Our server was great.

I had a tasty cocktail and the tri tip dip. Melt in your mouth amazingness. Seriously. The happy hour cheese plate was good as well.

I would definitely recommend this place if you want a good place with tasty food."}
{"text":"Very very slow with the food coming out of the kitchen and the waiter bringing our tab took 21 min. The food was good but a little over priced in my opinion for just a regular hamburger, cool environment in the restaurant helped them with the 3 stars"}
{"text":"Super fun place to go on a date night or experience something new, the menu is so delicious and the vibe is pretty cool. I love the ping pong there and corn hole. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is located inside the Hard Rock in Vegas and unlike Pink Taco that is also in there, this place is really good.  Decided to check it out due to the persuasive hostess, glad we did.  It's got quite the selection of food.  The appetizers we had were homemade potato chips, really good, and warm pretzels with cheese dip, ah-mazing.  Service was great too, quick and friendly.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken I've had in my life.  PLUS amazing decor, great/fun service, delicious drinks, and the rest of the food (outside of the incredible fried chicken) is darn good too.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Last night had a delicious turkey pastrami and coleslaw on pretzel roll with perfect fries.  The prices were fair and the staff was very friendly, courteous and quick.  To top it off there was a great local band playing (Stoked!).  Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Loved the restaurant, the live music, and the food & drink were all top notch.  Service was great, too, even with a big group on a busy Friday night.  Memorable dishes were the fried chicken (amazing - great flavor and very crunchy), the pretzel fondue, the cheese & charcuterie plate and the ribs.  

We ate the next night at Mastro's Steakhouse and everyone in our group wished we had eaten at Culinary Dropout again.  Mastro's was 3 times the price and everything was below the standard set the night before.

I hope they come to Denver soon."}
{"text":"OMG... great place!! Loved the roasted beets, the Winter Salad, and ESPECIALLY the YUMMY carmel popcorn dessert.... AMAZING!!!! Definitely be back here soon!!"}
{"text":"I was invited to Culinary Dropout for a Moms night out - and as a mom - nothing is better than having good food, a few drinks, and nice conversation.  I really wanted to be excited about this place but as soon as I saw the drink list was more extensive than the actual food menu I knew I was at a bar (which isn't what I was going for)..

That being said - the drinks were exceptional - between the HomeEc Martini to the bacon infused Bloody Mary...  Hands down, FIVE stars..  Overpriced?  I think the pricing aligns with the market/area..

The place was loud..  Like, really loud..  Which again, kind of aligns with the whole \"bar\" feel.  It wasn't conducive for conversation that didn't require yelling..  However, the general appearance of the place gives your senses a little tingle because it is beautifully decorated, from the multiple GIANT chandeliers to the purple, textured wall, it was pleasing to the eye.  Which was a nice distraction from the groaning in my stomach from the hour and a half wait.

When it did come time to be seated and order I was forced to review that scant menu once again..  Because of all of the Yelpers recommendation, we got two orders of the pretzel fondue, as well as one order of oysters.  Nothing wrong with any of it.  Oysters were nice and fresh and properly prepared (very important!); the pretzel fondue was good but I didn't see God or anything.  Pretzels were nice and fluffy.  I kind of 'get' the 'dropout' concept from the menu - meatloaf, fried chicken, beef stroganoff, burgers, gnocchi - I guess they are giving a twist to comfort foods..?  The descriptions were lacking, and I didn't read one description that screamed \"eat me! I'm awesome!\"..  I finally settled on beef stroganoff simply because I imagined it would be hard to be disappointed.  It was obvious to me they are using quality, fresh ingredients.  The stroganoff had peas, nice pieces of meat, mushrooms, and a nice beef broth; but ya can't give a girl a dollop of sour cream?  C'mon man!  It wasn't terrible - but it wasn't the eighth wonder of the world either.  

Will I go back?  For drinks, yes...  But will reserve my meal for a better menu, with better tasting food, probably some where else."}
{"text":"Very urban spot but there's a bit of wait in the food, very family like oriented place with lots of ambiance"}
{"text":"The Korean Beef is really good but overpriced.
The fish and chips were average.
The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Wow. The food was great and the atmosphere was enchanting. Crazy beer list including a mystery beer in a brown bag. The fried chicken is on point and the Korean Ribeye is mind blowing."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for my birthday dinner with my bf and his family. Ordered a drink at the bar which was yummy (two soft words). Our food came out very quickly..after only like 10-15 min. Bf had the PUB burger which he claims is one of his favorites. I had the fried chicken. Tender. Juicy. Delishness. Even though we didnt order any dessert, they gave us a small thing of monkeybread with ice cream as a birthday treat.. supposedly the person in our group who made the reservation mentioned it. It was enough to tide us over for my after dinner treat of sprinkles cupcakes. Also had a fun game of corn hole (beanbag toss game). Service was awesome"}
{"text":"We have been to the Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale and Phoenix. We didn't care for the one in Phoenix but we wanted to try the Tempe location. There were 4 adults in our party and we were celebrating our adult daughters' birthday. First of all, the restaurant is hard to find - many one way streets and construction. When you enter you go down a long hall to the actual restaurant. The restaurant itself is similar to a large convention hall with poor acoustics. It was very, very loud - making it difficult, at times impossible, to have a normal conversation. Our server was really lacking in just about every trait a server should have, including the 4 rings in her exposed belly button - not very appetizing. From the moment we arrived we felt very rushed by her. Our meals were pretty good. I had the sweet corn cannelloni, which was an unusual dish and very sweet, my husband had the Italian Grinder - something he always orders at CD, our son had the fried chicken which he said was very good and our daughter had the grilled cheese sliders, which she thought were OK. We had ordered a bowl of the \"daily house made chips\", which were stale. Despite our opening gifts, cards, etc., the server never acknowledged our celebration. 

Quite frankly, I am sorry we chose this restaurant for our daughter's birthday. It was a disappointing evening. I expect more from a Fox Concepts restaurant."}
{"text":"We are big fans of the Fox Concepts restaurants and have been to most.  We have eaten at the Culinary Dropout  in Scottsdale several times and really enjoyed it so we were looking forward to having lunch at the one in Phoenix.    In order to park you have to use the valet (for insurance reasons, according to the valet guy).  The restaurant was dark and very loud, not the usual Fox Concepts ambiance.   Our server, Raegan, was excellent  - upbeat and  knowledgeable  She checked back several times to see how our food was. This is unusual, anymore, an upbeat, attentive server.  The food was OK , yet pricey- not the usual Fox Concepts quality that we have come to expect.   All in all, except for the server,  a disappointing experience so we will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Monkey bread and Cap'N Crunch French toast were most note worthy. Our service was a little slow. We went for brunch Saturday and weren't in a rush but it took a while for our server to come by in order to ask for things we wanted."}
{"text":"The pretzel fondue! The caramel popcorn! Culinary is the best palace for comfort food with a twist.  Their cocktail menu is one of the best in old town for bourbon drinkers."}
{"text":"I have been to Culinary dropout once before but my recent visit was remarkably amazing. I am a vegetarian and they dont have anything on the main course menu for us veggies which is why I ordered a nachos without meat as an appetizer. When I ordered hummus as the main course, the waitress felt bad and quickly ran to the kitchen to talk to the chef if he could hook me up something veg and came back with a couple of options. We finally settled on a veggie wrap and I jokingly said that you should add this to the menu so that I remember it the next time. The next day when I was heating my left over wrap, I was surprised to see the recipe on the box. Truly nice place and nice people. Here is the image of the box with the recipe: http://i.imgur.com/DDLlAlK.jpg"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see the construction of the Culinary Dropout at The Yard! Many a Sunday, I have made the long trek to the Culinary in Scottsdale and now I have my very own right up the street! The service here is always great and I love to watch the food preparation with the open layout providing a great kitchen view. Since I am not a meat eater, I tend to order the sweet corn cannelloni for dinner or the tuna sliders for lunch. However, regardless of the time of day, I am always able to eat my fair share of the pretzels and fondue....If it was socially acceptable I would drink this provolone cheese sauce. 

If it is time to get your happy hour on, try the Singapore sling and drink it on the open concept patio. They make the best I have ever had. The patio is huge and has enough games to keep you occupied while sipping on one of their many fabulous concoctions."}
{"text":"This place is great. Excellent pretzel apps. Humus was awesome. Dinner was cannelloni, ribeye and burger. All sensational. Drinks cold refreshing and tasty. Very cool atmosphere. Went late Sunday after moving my son into ASU. Manager thought our order took too long so apps and dessert were comped. Really not necessary. Can't say enough good things. We will return."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both experiences were equally great. The atmosphere is perfect- laid back and trendy with a great view of the pool. The food is unique and delicious while the drinks are original and tasty. 

Food Review:

Crispy Prosciutto Deviled Eggs: Yummy but too salty (due to the prosciutto)

Oysters: I love that you can order by the oyster ($3 each)

House Potato Chips: Very crispy, served with house made onion dip

Gorgonzola Chicken Salad: We chose to have ours served on a pretzel roll instead of a salad and it was delicious! Crispy apples and celery cut through the gorgonzola. 

Meats and Cheeses: We tried a variety and they were very tasty, served with crispy bread. 


I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"no outside tables available on a Sat night so we opted for immediate seating indoors. The best way that I can describle the vibe is edgy. Conversation can be a bit challanging due to the noise level. Our waiter was very friendly anf enthusiastic. He was right on the money with the soft pretzels with cheese fondue. Amazing. Very creative menu. I tryed the gnocci with sausage and mushrooms. The gnocci were light and delicious but they were overwhelmed by too much sausage. I give an A for creativity and a C for execution. No drinks or deserts"}
{"text":"Second time here and food and service were great again.  It was easier to get a table in August than it was in April.  For appetizers, the nachos are great as are the pretzels with cheese fondue.  The 36 hour ribs are good, meat loaf was tasty, the fried chicken is also very good.  The steak is not bad.  The fish was good but a bit salty, could be because we don't use salt in our food."}
{"text":"I personally love going to this Culinary Dropout. I feel that this one is upscale restaurant vs. the other locations in the valley. In addition, this location is very relaxed and the fact that it is right across Fashion Square is definitely a plus.

I have tried their pretzel cheese fondue, boy is that delicious. I have also had their Fried Chicken Biscuits, which are very tasty. Their salad options are great and are delicious. 

The staff there are very sweet and always asking their customers if they need anything throughout the customers dine in experience. 


The only reason why I did not give them a five star is because if you book them on Open Table for reservations, they do not affiliate themselves with the points that open table has. With that being said, it's not going to stop me from going here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I love the food, atmosphere and staff. I had the French Dip sandwich, it was great! My favorite drink is the Classic Mule. It's definitely the best version of the Moscow Mule I've ever had. Both times I've been, the same bar tender took care of me. His name was Matt, he dressed very sharp, provided quick service and was laughing and engaging with all who were seated at the bar which leads to the atmosphere: it's fun! Hipster style, very open and airy, (entire wall facing pool area is wide open) and trendy. Definitely make this place a stop for some good food and drinks with a high energy atmosphere."}
{"text":"***This Culinary Dropout has a great look (it takes up residence in a modern warehouse) and the flavors were there too; unfortunately, the food on hot courses was lukewarm to cold, which hurt the overall experience***

There is a string of Culinary Dropout restaurants throughout the Phoenix area. This gastropub features a variety of classic dishes like meatloaf, fish and chips, fried chicken, and more. The preparations are contemporary, but they are also fairly straight-up and safe. A few more globally inspired dishes like Korean style beef and ramen also appear on the menu. 

I started with the soft pretzel bites with provolone cheese fondue. This was fairly good though there is a gastropub at the Wigwam serving a superior version. The preparation at Culinary Dropout is satisfying enough with a good pretzel crust on the bites and a creamy cheese fondue, but the pretzel bites were quite big (which results in a lot of bread that diminishes the impact of the salted pretzel crust) and the cheese fondue was not hot enough (in terms of temperature and not spiciness). 

For my entree, I had the Korean style ribeye cap and the quality of beef was very noticeable. With ribeye cap, you get the interior of a ribeye but a more distinct exterior like hanger steak. This allows the kitchen to achieve a far superior and more crispy crust than a regular ribeye and that is exactly what happened here. The interior was juicy, tender and flavorful while the outside had a nice crispy char. The Korean marinade, thankfully, was not too spicy and thus did not overpower the natural flavor of the steak. 

The garnishes were also cooked appropriately as the onions, mushrooms, zucchini, and bean sprouts were sautéed to the right texture. Unfortunately, everything on the plate was lukewarm to even slightly cold. This plate definitely sat a little too long on the pass. 

Service was very friendly and the food came out at a quick pace. However, both lukewarm to cold food for both starter and entree was worrisome. 

Prices were reasonable though prices for food in the Phoenix area tend to be more reasonable than other big city restaurants. 

This Culinary Dropout has a great look. It is located in a big and new looking warehouse complex that houses several upscale and modern restaurants. The industrial look combined with the variety of seating and even lawn style games creates a lively and energetic atmosphere. Unfortunately, I felt the restaurant was slightly uncomfortable as the seating was a tad stiff and the room temperature was too warm (which was surprising; I thought the room would have been more drafty than warm given its warehouse location). 

This Culinary Dropout near ASU has a great look and the menu serves fairly good food. However, the lukewarm and cold food worries me that guests may have a truly poor experience here from time to time. If you live in the area, this gastropub is worth trying considering the food quality and reasonable prices though I would suggest giving them a shot at a non-peak time. 

This restaurant has a free parking lot. Complimentary valet is also available."}
{"text":"Thanks Brian (the manager) for taking care of us after our experience. Speaks volumes. 

 The decor is really dope. However this is the worst customer service. We have been sitting here for 15 minutes and no one has taken our order, after we waited 45 minutes to be seated. WOW THAT WAS THE RUDEST WAITRESS EVERRRRRR"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a Moscow Mule and the Pretzel Fondue! Obsessed!"}
{"text":"Loved the pretzel bites and cheese fondue. Super delicious, with just salty enough pretzels and gooey cheese.  

Fresh local beer was wonderful and good selections. We also had an old fashioned. It was flavorful and fresh. 

And loved the Italian grinder sandwich. Lots of taste and tomatoes were so fresh. 

Our server Kobi was outstanding.

Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"love this place!!!  tempe and tucson
fox restaurants are the best!!!
super bowl, potato chips/dip....yummy!!  
fried chicken!!!"}
{"text":"First timer today & was not disappointed! In fact, this place is my cup of tea.  The food was more than perfect, the service was incredible, and the setup is ideal for a good time.  We had the pretzel with fondue, fried chicken, & pub burger with a side of onion sauce.  *deep sigh*  The pub burger with the onion sauce is the best burger I've ever had.  Ever. We will definitely be back for some Giant Jenga & Foosball."}
{"text":"I ordered the crispy shrimp caesar salad and it was delicious! I also LOVE the pretzel bites! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas from Sam Francisco and was looking for a quick tip from yelp. This place had solid four stars after 123 reviews. How could that many yelpers be wrong.?

Well they weren't!  Had the pretzel fondue and yesterday soup for starters and both were great! Soup was very flavorful and came with a slice of toasted seasoned garlic bread. Only critique here might be a little less seasonings on the bread so you can use it to balance the taste of the very flavorful soup to your preference. The fondue was nice and saucy after having a chance to heat up. To make it easier for hungry diners to dig right in, perhaps it could have been melted to saucy consistency right before serving. It was only Luke warm when it got to the table, but warmed up nicely after a few minutes. After that, consistency and taste of cheese and pretzels were great!

Fried chicken was the main course and it did not disappoint! Cooked perfectly juicy tasty and tender, you get half a chicken, two sides and a biscuit so be hungry! Or share. 

Monkey bread for dessert. Fresh from the oven with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Like a different kind of apple pie a la mode.  If you have room left to enjoy this is the dessert to get! Or jut come in for dessert after a night of party or gaming."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and you get a great amount of food for what you pay. Sitting outside is my favorite and the Pretzel Bites are the best!"}
{"text":"Finally made it up to Culinary Dropout and glad I did! I was surprised to see so much menu crossover from other Fox establishments but that didn't stop our table from sharing those famous little pretzels with fondue. Mains were good but nothing mind blowing. The desserts were the shining stars.  I'm glad we had friends to split the chocolate torte & caramel pudding with because I really don't think I'd be able to choose beween the two."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool!  If it weren't for the server who started out awesome and ended up rude, I would give it five stars. I guess three middle-aged patrons weren't nearly as interesting as a table full of Girls' Night Outers. Once the ladies showed up, I sat for the next hour with no refill of water and no question of whether we wanted dessert or not.  When we finally flagged him down(after lots of arm-waving and attempted eye contact)  for the dessert menu, he said, \"Well, there are only four things,\" and he hurriedly rattled them off and did NOT wait to see if we wanted any of them!  RUDE!  Fortunately for this awesome restaurant though, I will only knock off one star for this jerk, as the rest of the place is to die for. 

I love the design and decor.  As it was about 82 degrees this day, the front windows were opened up into the patio area.  Lots of cool chandaliers throughout the place, and for lighting over individual seating areas?  Trouble lights!  Just like the ones my dad uses when he works on stuff, only slightly more trendy. Seating included leather couch-type things, and at the end of the place was a giant screen television.  I would love to come here to watch an important game!  By the way, my dining companions thought the noise level was a bit too loud, but I thought it was fine. 

Now for the food.  I ordered the pork belly Cubano, and it was wonderful!  BF ordered some sliced filet medallion things that were so perfectly cooked and flavored.  Our friend ordered some kind of squash dish that didn't appeal to me, but she said it was great. Additionally, we had the pretzel fondue appetizer, and I devoured it.  Finally, the beer selection contained a variety of bottle and tap selections that would appeal to anyone's taste.  

Would I return?  Definitely!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places you hear is good. But when you finally get a chance to try it your mind is absolutely blown. The atmosphere is playful and relaxed. The service is quick, skilled and friendly. But the food messed me up. It ruined me for other restaurants by raising the bar so high. Wish I could give them 6 stars."}
{"text":"Gastropub - my definition is nice fatty fat fat bar food that usually can't disappoint, but we were not only NOT disappointed, but very impressed.  According to their website, Culinary Dropout is a gastropub created by Fox Restaurant Concepts.  The first time I encountered a Fox restaurant was in Tucson, AZ with Wildflower and it was amazing.  Food was fresh.  Flavors were well-rounded and the decor and staff were very attractive.  =)  Our experience with Culinary Dropout Las Vegas proved to be product of the brains behind Fox.  Though a different type of restaurant all together, all the details similar to my experience at Wildflower came together.  The service was impeccable (waters filled constantly, all staff checking on you, very smartly dressed in hobo chic for girls and vests for guys).  The food was fatty, delicious and well thought out.  The decor was romantic, whimsical and relaxing, so much so that I felt like I was in an episode of The Hills reality show.  Definitely a date night place or nice cozy hang out with your friends.

Foood.
1.  Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue - Usually not a fan of pretzels, but theses lil' guys were fluffy and perfectly salted and hard to resist once dipped in the warm pot of cheese.
2.  Grilled Cheese Sliders with bacon and tomato - Baby sliders!  Just as tasty as they were cute.
3.  Jambalaya - Well rounded, robust and perfectly sauce.  Best jambalaya yet? oooo
4.  Fried Chicken with honey biscuits, potatoes and gravy - Nothing can beat fried chicken at Ad Hoc in Napa, but this chicken platter had it's own character.  The breading was delicate, light and uniquely seasoned (cumin, my friend Tina says?).  The honey biscuits were slightly sweet and fluffy; I totally commandeered the rest of said friend's biscuits.
5.  The Pub Burger with havarti, bacon and house bbq sauce - Big burger = Big flavor.  Nice moist burger patty with sweet smokey bbq sauce.
6.  Monkey Bread - Ooey gooey, warm and comforting

Conclusion:  I'm coming back to hang out when I want feel trendy and eat well.

p.s.  For the HGTV addicts, we saw Antonio Ballatore and got a picture with him!"}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips and it was amazing. Get a side of their home made ranch full of herbals and seasoning."}
{"text":"This place was great. It has complementary valet parking. The wait is long but worth it. 1.75 mystery beers in bags, awesome. Mystery shots served in little airline bottles was hysterical fun. The food was excellent with some classic and some modern dishes. I especially liked the antipasto and it's wide selection. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My teenage daughter and I used to love this place! However, the service is getting so bad... We likely won't be back. I thought maybe because they are busy... but as they started to clear out it got worse! We sat for over two hours, one drink and had to ask for it twice! We asked for BBQ with meatloaf, twice... She brought it when we were done. How do they stay in business?"}
{"text":"Loud and sub-par service with decent food. Pretzel bites are addictive, chicken curry was good, the Irishman drink was pretty good.

Waitress was untrained and lazy when it came to service. She could have easily sold a few more drinks if she had even bothered to ask if we wanted another.

Music is cranked to the point where you have to yell to be heard, which only makes the problem worse because then you hear everyone adjacent to you yelling to be heard.

Fine for some, not really for me."}
{"text":"Great experience and even better food. The manager, James, took excellent care of us. Fondu pretzels are awesome. Ribeye and trout were also great. Ended with the caramel pudding...wow. Inside was pretty cool and hip. Great selection of bourbons and scotches. Go there. They will take excellent care of you"}
{"text":"Overall I (and my 5 dinner companions) were very impressed with this place. As many others have noted, the pretzel fondue (provolone) ($10) is outstanding. The \"crusty bread and good olive oil\" ($2) is also very good. Main courses were mostly to everyone's liking - after chowing down on the pretzels and bread I was glad I ordered the Crispy Shrimp Caesar Salad ($13). Though crispy, the shrimp wasn't greasy, and the salad had just the right amount of dressing for my taste (not too much, not too little). My wife didn't have as much luck with the fried chicken -- too much honey flavor for her. We took the rest home and I ate it today; I agree, though the chicken itself is perfectly prepared. A friend who ordered it had the same experience.  I also liked the interesting selection of beers, including some locals (like the Four Peaks HopKnot IPA - very powerful flavor, very good; and the SanTan Epicentre American Amber - light but good; they also offer lots in cans, which apparently is all the rage). True, it's too loud, and service was great albeit overly attentive, and one could complaint about the price of the drinks (but it is Scottsdale, after all). But overall a positive experience; I'd go back, at the very least for the pretzels."}
{"text":"I had a relative in town a couple of weekends ago so decided to meet up with some other friends and family at the Culinary Dropout on 7th Street on Sunday morning for brunch.  There were 5 of us in all and we are seasoned \"brunchers\" , so we were excited to try it out.  The first warning sign came with my call the day before; I got someone on the phone who was downright rude when I asked about whether I should (or could) make a reservation.  I was apprehensive about the next day and surprised because this is a Fox restaurant and I expect better from them.

We arrived the next morning in different cars and were greeted by the valets, who were really nice.  I stopped in at the Ladies room and found that both doors to the restroom go into the same place.  I'm no prude but it felt awkward to me.  We were shown to an outside high table which proved to be uncomfortable to one of our party due to back problems so we then moved to a regular table but still had hard chairs.  I was eyeing the sofas but was told that they were \"reserved\" for large parties.  Amazingly, those \"large\" parties somehow shrank when the guests began showing up.

The food showed up promptly and was enjoyed by everyone.  I had the biscuits and gravy, my visitor had the breakfast sandwich, and others had more traditional egg dishes.  I had coffee which was decent but had trouble keeping it, and our water glasses, filled.  I suspect the service will get better once the team figures things out.

So, Culinary Dropout, here are my suggestions for getting me (and all the friends who rely on my suggestions), back again:

1.  Central Phoenix is NOT Scottsdale.  There are a ton of great restaurants very close to you who are really service-focused.  This is a crowd who wants a good meal and to be treated well.  When that happens, you get fierce loyalty and repeat business...just ask the Windsor about that.

2.  Focus on doing what you're good at.  You cannot be all things to all people.  There are other restaurants in Central Phoenix who are having the same issue and it is hurting them, in my opinion.  Try to focus on the neighborhood locals; they are the ones who will keep you healthy.

So I didn't want this to sound so harsh but you have little time to \"make it\" in this neck of the woods....I sincerely want this to work for you and the neighborhood.  Until these things improve, I won't be back.  Just sayin'....."}
{"text":"OK where do I begin. 

During an three day weekend to Las Vegas, I had opportunity to visit  Culinary Dropout three times. 

 When we initially walk inside the location, we were greeted by an young lady, whom was very friendly and cooler than a fan.  She then provided us on options of where would we like to be seated, the bar, a table or sitting down at a table outside facing this awesome jungle style pool. I decided NOT to get my George of the jungle ON and we said by the bar. Being the cool person I am me and the lady posted up by the tvs like we had the remote control . Lol

The menu is pretty basic but offered the right options we needed to satisfy the beast. I order the Fried shrimp Caesar salad, and the breakfast burrito since it was only 11:30 AM. Boy did they both live up to my expectations! The breakfast Bburrito display much flavor and is a good size. You literally can split this with a partner or friend. The breakfast Brito also came with some crispy delicious potatoes. On the side came this delicious salsa to get my toes twinkling. The salad was very fresh and the fried shrimp was very crispy.

I also tried a new IPA call Big Dog that was referred by the cool bartender with the awesome tattoos. Word-of-mouth is that Dig Dog IPA is on the rise. 

Our food came out extremely fast and the service promptly took care of us. Thank you for a good experience. 


 If any readers try Dig Dog IPA or had tried it, please let me know what you think about it."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch yesterday. The bread is amazing. Smoked salmon avocado toast was really good too. The ambience was awesome. The service was a bit awkward at first but our waiter ended up being great. Great drinks too. Definitely will be back when it's warmer to sit outside."}
{"text":"Okay....a restaurant is called Culinary Dropout which lead me to believe it was probably another \"foo foo\" restaurant......I was wrong!! Went there for the first time today and found it casual and a good place to kick back with friends. It has a good variety of appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, etc. We had a couple of appetizers and then I ordered the chicken tortilla soup......it was incredible! I am a \"tortilla soup aficionado\" and this was as good as any I have had in the valley. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"In a word, this place is overrated. I get the dark ambiance of the Hard Rock and every business within it, but I should at least be able to see my menu without having to whip out my phone for a light source. That being said, nothing on the menu stands out.

They're really pushing the pretzel fondue, but the table next to us got it and it didn't look appealing. Prosciutto deviled eggs sounded awesome but were in reality a let down- I guess for $4/order, that shouldn't surprise me, but the \"prosciutto\" was more like bacon bits than any other meat I've had. 

Italian antipasto salad makes a decent and filling lunch, with ample protein and a tasty dressing. But the \"yesterday's soup\", chicken tortilla, is basic- I mean, at least add some sort of garnish for $7/bowl. Chicken was a bit spicier than expected but overall the dish fell flat.

The only thing saving this review was friendly service. But I can't eat service... Menu has no direction and the food received did not interest me enough to warrant ordering an entrée or returning.

NOTE: HH is from 3-6PM,Mon-Fri. But good luck getting a HH menu, no one seems to want to give them out. Maybe just cancel it if you don't want to honor it?"}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out and get out of the casino environment. It is loud but they have a cool outdoor seating area w fire pits. Everything I've had here is great. Fried http:/chicken, meatloaf, prime rib, pretzels, artichoke. The best spot in hard rock to eat at."}
{"text":"We ordered the pretzel rolls and cheese, turkey pastrami and the grilled cheese. All three were delicious. There was so much food that this is where the review gets real..  we took some of everything home. The pastrami was just as good the next day, the grilled cheese was not soggy and was still crunchy the next day and the pretzel rolls tasted so good with the cup of cheese they packed
Me to go. 

We also tried the s'mores dessert and the monkey bread. They snuck apples into the dessert and I didn't even mind. The s'mores were great. 

Of course there were drinks. Something with jalapeño which we drank quickly. The blueberry daiquiri and the dirty bird (the soiled dove). 

Service was fast and very friendly. All employees seemed genuinely happy to work there and our waiter Johnny (Ric) was outstanding. 

I recommend everyone go her to eat."}
{"text":"We were told the wait would be 30-40 min. It's been an hour and twenty min so far.  Once we were seated the managers were very apologetic. Totally redeemed themselves. Plus the food and drinks were delicious!"}
{"text":"Solid Happy Hour with a decent wine selection. The Antipasti platter for 7.00 is excellent and such a great value."}
{"text":"My wife and I love eating here. This was our second time eating there this week the staff is the best! The food is great. 
Highly recommend the antipasti."}
{"text":"Ok I am a sucker for ambiance and culinary dropout had me from the moment I walked in. This restaurant cum fun center looks like a massive barn with a fun bar, games and outdoor and indoor seating. 

Perfect for:
-playing & watching games while eating (ADHD eaters)
-dates where you're afraid the convo will be boring
-lunches with coworkers you want to tune out

They had me again at turkey pastrami. If you're not familiar...it's one of the most flavorful meats you can have without eating pork. And it's even more flavorful if done right.  This place does it right.

Beer selection:
Solid selection of local beers and an interesting cocktail menu I want to come back for."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great! Our server was attentive and gave great suggestions. He knew the menu well. The pink Cadillac marg was very good. I tried the dropout classic mule as well, but I'm not a huge fan of ginger so I knew I wouldn't like the mule that much. My cousin and her husband got the shaved prime rib dip & the grilled steak tacos. They both seemed very pleased with their order. I got the kale salad with hot salmon (instead of the cold smoked salmon), and it was delicious! I would definitely order it and come here again. We arrived around 6:30pm on a Wednesday night, and there was a 45 minute wait. So they're definitely really busy, so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They are open later than most in the area and have a wide variety of food to choose from on the menu and always live music playing old songs with a new twist or new songs with their twist lol. Staff is always friendly and the ambiance is eclectic and shabby chic/ homey. Great place to just have drinks or dinner or both! My husband loves the waffles and chicken and I'm more of the salmon but I've tried everything and no complaints! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"There wasn't much to do at the Hard Rock on Christmas Eve- the casino was empty, I didn't feel like going over to the strip quite yet, and I didn't want to be the only person at the casino bar.

Well, I ended up being the only one at Culinary Dropout's bar anyway.

Wild berry beer ($7) seemed to be a good choice after a quick Yelp skim- the cute bartender said it was a very smart choice: tastes just like juice but contains 8% alcohol and you don't get all the beer bloat. Yum.

It seemed like the consensus was brunch, which surprised the bartender because he said they didn't usually get many people in for breakfast/brunch. No problem, I wasn't planning on breakfast, anyway. I love my carbs, so pretzel bites and cheese fondue it was.

Not sure the Chimayo [beer] was worth the $12, but you can't put a price on experience.

Halfway through, I really had to go to the bathroom (downside of having a small bladder). There's no restroom inside the restaurant. Cool thing is, they let me walk out without having opened a tab with a credit card or paying.

I came back only to watch some middle-aged guy across from me inhale a hamburger and a Sicilian man next to me down two cups of coffee. By the way, did I mention he works with Manny Pacquiao?

Cute bartender is also a responsible one. After he made me two more drinks, he wanted to make sure I didn't go \"stumbling out\". Thanks, but unfortunately, nothing gets in the way of this girl shopping on the strip. The bill was ridiculously cheap, which I had to make up with a gracious tip.

If anyone discovers a new Mexican/Asian fusion restaurant open on the strip and the co-owner is a young man from Tijuana who moved to Vegas for family, chances are, you're in good hands."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place has eclectic options and is a great spot for people watching.  With an outdoor dining area and belly up to bar service, it's a great spot (except in summer when it's too hot to be outside).  Great beer and wine selection and the food is great."}
{"text":"Hubby and I liked this place -- friendly service, fun atmosphere -- but we probably won't be back. The food's good, but not great. The only memorable dish was the chicken chicharrones -- now THAT was yum, but not good enough reason to return. Plus, it's super loud."}
{"text":"Fun place where you can eat drink and play games- all while listening to music!  If youhave not been here, give it a try. They tend to have a younger crowd- but all there seemed to be having fun!"}
{"text":"I revisited the restaurant a year later and had my favorite dish the seared tuna salad. It was wilted, missing cashews and dressing was very bland. After being cured for a month of my gastritis I am highly sensitive to flavor since I have been eating a bland diet. So for me to say its bland, that's wildly bland. I think the proper protocol when a customer returns a dish is to be compassionate, apologetic then offer them something off the menu immediately. Like \"my sincerest apologies about the salad, let me offer you a different salad or a sanwhich\" suggest suggest suggest, don't ask me what i would like without a menu, .....just some people make an uncomfortable situation more uncomfortable. Ehhh"}
{"text":"I really like this place overall, very lively (we arrived middle of happy hour).  Really inventive menu. Had brussel sprouts for an appetizer which I never thought I would and they were, in fact, delicious. Had their kale salad and topped it with salmon steak which was Perfection. Their fried chicken is good, it looks like it's over cooked, but it's not, it was really juicy but it's kind of sticky. Mashed potatoes and gravy were okay, but kind of surprised their coleslaw was a little plain given that everything else was so flavorful.

Did learn a lesson - if you order drinks, wait till they arrive before you order your food. We ordered cocktails and they did not show up until we were 2/3 done with our dinner, not the time I usually enjoy a cocktail. Cocktails were delicious, but still the flow of service wasn't really in place. However, our waitress was nice and accommodating and the manager came over, they comped a piece of their yummy banana cream pie. So definitely going back just now know wait for drinks, then food."}
{"text":"I really liked the outdoor patio dining area.  Our waitress was really nice but dressed in workout clothes.  I thought it was weird that they have a very loose dress code.  We had the ribs and ribeye.  Both were excellent.  I definitely preferred the ribs.  They were great.  The ribeye was spicy and didn't have a lot of flavor.  It wasn't something I'd order again for the money.  We had a gift card so it was doable.  Parking could be difficult because it's located right across from the Scottsdale mall.  We lucked out and found a space across the street.  Otherwise you'd have to park in the parking structures."}
{"text":"The food was SO good! Nachos, ribs and MAC burger were great. Plus, some fun live music on a Friday night. The service was definitely a miss here though. Our waiter was not attentive- we really could have used a second round of drinks! Oh well."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today. The food was about average and the cocktails were weak. The worst part, sharing my lunch with flies. It was absolutely disgusting!!! Suffice to say, I couldn't finish my meal."}
{"text":"It's local, but it's also a chain and the food quality reflects that, except for the pretzels. Those are crazy good. Big, loud, and kind of a hipster a whole place. Wax yer stache, comb your beard, and roll up the sleeves of your fashionable button up a quarter of the way up; make sure your peers see your new ink! So unique. There will also be plenty of baby boomers there spending their money while they have the energy to do so, play corn hole with those raisins. 

Dudes smoking weed right out the front door when we were leaving at about 9:30 on a random Thursday in feb 2018. Lol. 

Reposted this review after inadvertently posting on the wrong location of this chain restaurant and post removal by yelp. (Maybe the chain restaurant group had something to do with the posting complaints? Hmm). Ps. This Place serves the Sysco bull $&!t food service garb. Over rated."}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype. Games to play while waiting or before you eat shuffle board corn throw ping pong. Food is all spectacular just a bit unusual shrimp Caesar incredible tons of tiny shrimp. Pretzel balls great better than imagined"}
{"text":"This restaurant is best suited as an after-work place to gather with co-workers to have a few drinks and, maybe, eat. As a destination for food, alone, it is \"OK\", but not high on my list. 

During our first, and likely only visit, the best part of the experience was the service. Concierge staff greeted us with a positive, friendly manner. Our table server was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. 

I would like to give a 4 stars, but the food was simply too average."}
{"text":"I've gone to the Scottsdale location for a few years each time I go down to visit for spring training.  So, when I heard that Fox Restaurants was opening a Culinary Dropout in Vegas, I was very excited.

Fun atmosphere, with great natural light as both the bar and restaurant open up to the patio to overlook the pool at the Hard Rock.   Food seems to be right on par from the Scottsdale store - pretzel bread fondue, fried chicken and pork belly cubano, taste just like I remember - great flavor, good portions and good value.  Beer menu and cocktail menu is top ten on the strip (if you want to put Hard Rock on the \"Strip\").  I sat at the bar to watch some Sunday Football, our bartender was very friendly and it was good to see she had her bartending skills honed - technique looked sound and she makes a good crafted cocktail.  Thank god she served us, as another bartender came in later and she seemed to be to wrapped around her nails, her looks and some other bartender rather than serving any of the guests.  

If only this was a neighborhood restaurant located at the District in Green Valley, I'd be a permanent fixture...  But I look forward to going back soon!  Sam, thanks for bringing Vegas a concept we have been lacking for way too long - next time, bring it to my neighborhood.  :)"}
{"text":"Really great food at a reasonable price. Excellent service, and friendly staff that really seem to help together. My only hesitation would be the low lighting, and hard to hear the over the loud music. But do not let that stop you from going."}
{"text":"Disappointed! The first time I went, the fish and chips were incredible. Second time, fish tasted different ! Cooked differently. I would recommend, but something was off. Though, the fries were great !"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends before heading over to the Magic Mike show, which is right across from here. It was happy hour and the four of us were sat immediately which was great cause we were in a rush! We ordered sangria off the happy hour menu which was only 5$ and they were big! They had both red and white, both were delicious. I ordered the pork belly nachos, only 9$ and the portion was HUGE, I almost couldn't finish them. We also had the pretzels with cheese, and they are hands down the best I've ever had. The cheese it came with was SO delicious and flavorful, you could definitely tell it wasn't some cheap cheese from a can! When I return (which I definitely will) I'll be ordering those again. Overall great experience, great service, and amazing happy hour!"}
{"text":"Updating my review because of the almost lightening speed they got back to me when I posted my bad experience. I'm glad they will be addressing it. Like I said as a business owner, I know how it is and training staff is an ongoing thing. Bravo to James for addressing it so promptly and on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"ok, I seriously hate sharing really good secrets for fear that they will switch it up and do away with my secret place, however we have been going here about once a week for the past two months. 

They have happy hour m-f 3-6 and while yes, the signature pretzel rolls are amazing, they give you a lot...why is this a problem...because the rest of the food is just that good too.

My husband always insists on having the meatloaf sandwich, so we forgo the pretzels most of the time now.  I always have to get the antipasta plate.  Usually pretty consistently the same, but they switch the cheeses out or the nuts out for a different flavor.  This is my favorite meal anyway, so very happy to get it for such a great deal.

And you'd think that since we go in for the cheap happy hour deals that the staff would be snooty...never once.

Oh and I forgot the fries...so good.  Actually much of their menu looks worth trying, but this stuff is so good that we don't want to try anything else.

So I am sharing my secret because they are usually a little slow...yes, we are there at their slow time, so I hope that they get enough party business to stay open....they are really good and really the menu prices are pretty decent for the location.  

So now that I wrote a review about your awesome happy hour, please do not change it :)

Update....this is still my favorite happy hour, but we did try the fried chicken, however I am a connoisseur of fried chicken and it didn't change my world....however I wanted to tell the manager to please be sure to take off the horrible instant mashed potatoes...if they don't want to make them, serving fries is perfectly acceptable w fried chicken.  Have also tried the chicken club sandwich now and while good, it is not as good as the meatloaf sandwich.  

Servers are always so super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"We found this place while waiting for us to check in our hotel. Great local beers and tge armosphere is amazing. The design of the building is awesome with plenty of edison bulbs and seating. They also have a outdoor covered patio with misters! Plenty of free games from foosball, corn hole, shuffleboard and free photo machine. Atmosphere is excellent, with indoor/outdoor bar. The food was awesome. I had a Turkey Pastrami Sandwhich and my wife and the pork belly nachos. Everything is made from scratch. The tortilla chips on the were crunchy and hell and even survived the queso and meat bath that was bestowed upon it! Will definately be back before we head back to Dallas. Oh and the San Tan Moon Juice IPA is a local beer that is smooth and not as happy as most IPAs."}
{"text":"For as much as this restaurant was hyped, and for as much thought as was put into the aesthetics, I expected much better food.

We visited CD on a Friday around noon, when I thought the place would be full.  Instead, we found it virtually empty, which is not usually a good sign, especially for a place so centrally located in Old Town Scottsdale.  I tried the cheeseburger, which the waiter described to me as the best burger he had ever had, hands down.  While there was nothing wrong with the burger, I would probably not order it again.

Sure, it's a cool looking place, and I'd go again if it were just for drinks, but I wouldn't recommend it as a restaurant...not when there are so many better restaurants so close by."}
{"text":"Went here with family and friends on Saturday.  Most of us were out of towners from San Diego, but a local recommended us to drop by here.  My girlfriend and I split the steak, and a chicken sandwich.  Both of which were really good.  Our fries were very cold, which obviously wasn't ideal, our server got us a new batch after we mentioned it though (two others at our table also had cold fries).  Our veggies were really really salty.  

The game room was very fun, we did ping pong and corn hole for a couple hours and then called it a night.

If I'm in the area I would come back."}
{"text":"Can only comment on happy hour food but was delish! HH Is from 2-5 and they have some smoking deals! Sangria is a tasty and dangerous and i could have easily had a pitchers worth! Split the meatloaf Sammie plus the pretzel fondue with another person was plenty of food for two or 3! The meatloaf Sammie tasted more like a meatball sub with the cheese on it but deff not complaining! Friends ordered The nachos -they were delish the meat was sweet which gave it a good twist! Large location and good atmosphere. Plenty of parking ."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice on visits to Tempe.  Great atmosphere...sometimes a little loud but still nice.  The pretzel bites to dip in fondue is signature appetizer.  First time I had a great chicken herb soup..(can't recall exact name) was delicious but it wasn't soup of day on 2nd visit.  Enjoyed the sandwiches...."}
{"text":"4 stars because Stewie is a G and one star because the food, restaurant and the ambiance is lovely. Let's talk about Stewie... Very tentative, very knowledgeable on his wines and also very kind as he gave me free dessert for my birthday!! My fiancé and I ordered the antipasto cheese and meat platter which was delicious. I ordered the ramen, which was good but needed sriracha to spice it up. My man got the fried chicken which he raved about! Lastly, the monkey bread is a must if you love dessert!!!"}
{"text":"I just can't put into words about how I feel about this place.  
I am staying at the hard rock casino for the night with my family who is visiting in town.  We picked this place because the name made us smile.  It all started with when we sat down.  We were lucky enough to get Mr. Paisly and Ms. Arlene.  They greeted us with a smile and a lot of laughs.  My wife and I are vegan and the menu was a little confusing. They explained it to us and we just said what ever the chef wants to make us.  
By far the food we got from chef Helena was the best we have had in this town.  We then learned that she is also a vegan.  
Overall great experience and it would of not been the same without Ms. Arlene and Mr. Paisley.  They are awesome and if I had a restaurant I would want them to manage it.  Thank you to the chef Helena for a great meal."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! I have been multiple times and every time has been fantastic. The atmosphere is great and a few times that I have gone there has been live music."}
{"text":"Culinary dropout is this awesome spot in a trending neighborhood in PHX. I've had a business dinner here and while the spot is definitely geared towards young professionals and a hangout spot it turned out to be a great location for our purposes.
The restaurant overall is a modern-fun atmosphere, the restaurant is a large indoor space that opens up through roll-up doors (yes they're open) to a giant roofed outdoor space with lounge chairs for dining and an open space with lots of games (cornhole, etc) to choose from for entertainment and hang-out. Great vibes!

What surprised me was the food as everything we ordered was very tasty and the flavor was spot on! Not what we expected but a welcome surprise.
The menu is a more classy/refined twist of a pub menu. From all items we ordered the wings are what stuck out - probably the best I've had anywhere so far! The nachos were mean and loaded with well made pork belly. My seared tuna salad came out great and as raw as tuna is supposed to be - well balanced.

I'll definitely be back here on my next trip to PHX and highly recommend this place as a spot for a casual hangout in a fun atmosphere and good food!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in on a Wednesday for HH and the place was packed but got a table and we had the best server Christian. We both work in the service industry and Christian was very helpful and suggested many different drink options as well as being very knowledgable on food items. For how full the place was our food came out in a very timely manner. After eating we ended up staying another hour or so based on Christian being very energetic as well as the atmosphere. We also got a complementary desert from Christian which was their Monkey Bread which was awesome. Will be coming back for sure for HH next week."}
{"text":"I went there a couple of days ago and had Rebecca. The service was absolute perfection and I was in complete shock especially since the last time I went there I swore I would never come back. I went to this restaurant with all of my friends (everyone of us are servers) and we were all talking about how incredible our waitress was. Because of Rebecca I'm coming back to Culinary Dropout this weekend."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful afternoon at Culinary Dropout! Our Server William Wilson was amazing and delightful. 
Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! 

Staff is amazing (super friendly).

Food is so good (if you like meat TRY pork nachos!)

Beer and liquor selection is great. They even had Mezcal, I was shocked. (They have something called, paper bag beers or how I like to call them, mystery beers, only $1.95)

And finally, Live bands (some nights) and cool background music.


Not over....on top of that, they have games (love the ping pong and foosball table). 

What else you need?"}
{"text":"Andrew, the best server ever helped us choose our dishes. The food and service was off the charts.  We normally would not eat on the strip, but this is going to be our new go to place. 
Highly recommend trying this!!!"}
{"text":"Made a special trip to check this place out and they were closed for a private party. Seriously? On a Saturday? One of my biggest pet peeves when restaurants do this because ultimately, it's not good customer service. Can't recommend this place until I am confident they are open to the public on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"I don't have any revolutionary thoughts on this place, but my friends and I had a great meal here when we were visiting the Scottsdale area. First, what everyone says is true, get the pretzels. The pretzel bites on their own are well made, and when you throw in the provolone fondue, they're just stellar. I could have eaten these for a meal and been happy. Our group had already done happy hour snacks before hand, so I stuck to a side salad for my main course; I needed some greens after loading up on pretzels and cheese.  There's not much you can say about a side salad, all the ingredients were fresh and the buttermilk ranch dressing had such a tang that it blew my mind. I also had a specialty cocktail made with blueberry moonshine and cucumber, that shouldn't have worked, but it did. 

Our server was friendly and the right amount of attentive. There was a guitarist at the perfect sound level. I thought this place had good food, and really excelled at the details to bring it to that next level."}
{"text":"I dig Culinary Dropout. From the decor, to the food offerings, to the casual, trendy vibe. To the music selections, to the ping pong tables outside and the misters that help during hot Phoenix summers.

What separates Culinary Dropout for me from the other places in Tempe is the way the restaurant carries itself in attitude. No one is trying to upsell you stuff that you don't want, and it's just a chill place to be. No obscene drunks, and no stupid bar fights you might see nearby on Mill Ave.

Word of warning to prospective customers; this place is LOUD. When coming here, make sure you're okay with this, they sometimes have live music here which makes it even louder and can make conversation difficult especially if you're on a date. 

Some favorite menu items of mine:
\"Ma, the Meatloaf!\" - Classic meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans. The green beans are not the crappy kind from the can. Meatloaf is packed full of flavor yet makes you feel just the right amount of full.

\"Korean Style Ribeye Cap\" - This dish has hints of Asian Korean flavoring; it is a consort of ribeye steak and assorted veggies. Really good, would get it again.

\"Bistro Steak\" - See how I've only been ordering red meats here? The bistro steak paired with the fries is really good, whatever they use to flavor the steak is out of this world, some combination of a strong herb and a cream base.


As far as drinks go, I haven't had a bad drink here, but word to the wise, when I get moscow mules here, it's not served in a copper mug. Still, not a bad drink.

Would and have returned.

No need to talk about service; it is good."}
{"text":"Love this place and the food.. The pretzel roll on any sandwich is to die for! I always like to eat when I'm in town. Good vibes and energy!"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR WAS FUN, the service wasn't that great, they switched us waiters like 3 times and we had to wait a while to get our drinks. The food was very good though! Happy hour is from 3-5 FYI, but she overall a very good place to go if you have the time to spare!"}
{"text":"Looks appealing from the outside but menu is very limited and the drinks are overpriced. Service is slow."}
{"text":"Antipasto platter. Delicious.  Fried chicken. Delicious.  Drinks. Delicious.  Our server Rayanne awesome! Can't wait to come back. So good!"}
{"text":"What a great place with fantastic food. Whoever came up with this concept, good for them because they nailed it.  Waitress Angel was so friendly and accurate. everything we had was great. Korean steak cooked to perfection, apps and drinks were all perfect. Fondue pretzels were the best I've ever had.  Simply amazing"}
{"text":"Upon arriving we walked up to the hostess who asked how many and my name. I told her 3 and my name then she just continued typing on the screen for a minute then just sat there. No communication whatsoever. I finally had to ask if that was all and she looked at me like I was dumb then said \"yeah.\" OK, I guess the usual \"we'll call you when its ready\" or \"it'll be so and so minutes\" weren't in her vocabulary.

We came back after 15 minutes and were seated outside where it was nice. Then another 10 minutes of waiting for someone to take our order because they were severely understaffed even though it wasn't that busy. Our waitress was amazing though and that was probably the only good thing. 

Fish and chips were pretty oily and the fries just soaked up the oil. My friend got the burger that came out almost cold raw in the middle. Bloody mary's were mediocre. I'd definitely eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Jamie Lee our waitress was absolutely amazing! She was spot on with helping us navigate the delicious menu and the drink options were unbelievable. She really made our culinary experience exceptional."}
{"text":"We loved this place! All of the staff was extremely friendly! I had the shaved prime rib dip which was fantastic and my husband had the fried chicken which was also fantastic. We tried to the pretzel bites and fondue cheese and it definitely lived up to the hype! We went on a Saturday night and they were PACKED but our service was still excellent. I'd recommend  making a reservation on the weekends :) The atmosphere is really fun- we will be back for sure! If it's your first time, you can sign up on their website and receive $10 off :)"}
{"text":"I went with a group of 5 for dinner on a Friday night.  The wait wasn't too bad and we were seated at a nice, round table.  We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and dinner.  Our drinks finally came out and were disappointingly low on taste and alcohol.  10 min. after ordering, our entrees came out.  The waitress told us that our appetizer wasn't ready so she brought out our meal.  The entire meal felt very rushed.  Finally, our appetizer came out, midway through our meal.  
Overall, the food was mediocre and the service was barely satisfactory. There are many restaurants in town with more creative menus and better service."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place out.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to its 4 star yelp rating.  We dined on a Wed night- very slow.  

There was a group of 9 men at a hi-top that was being waited on by our server.  We were also a 9 top.  Our initial greeting by our server was great, but after that it all went rolling down hill.  

Service was horrible.  Drinks took forever.  Thank goodness we ordered the pretzel fondue and chips to start.  Food was ok.  Nothing to die or fondle over.  Our server took over 30 min to take our dinner order and we made it easy for her, as we ordered everything to share.  

The worst part was the entrees- it took over 45 min to get our entrees and when it came, It was stone cold.  Our ribeye was seriously COLD!  Obviously they tried to put up all 9 entrees at once,but could not keep everything hot.  Very, Very Poor!  1/2 of the entrees were COLD and the other 1/2 was Luke Warm.  

At this point we were truly disappointed, but we are not complainers.   Our belief is, we just won't come back.  We still wanted to believe in this place and ordered dessert to see if this place would redeem itself.  Unfortunately, it got a little better with dessert but not service.  

The Monkey Bread was a 7 on a scale of 1-10 and the Salted Carmel Pudding was an 8.  That was the hi light of the meal, sad to say.  

Service overall was poor.  Our server was non-efficient and non-existent and it was super SLOW!  No excuses when you are the servers ONLY table!  

$500 later and it was the WORST meal we had all week!  Yelpers beware of this joint.  Don't dine on a slow night.  Mediocre food and terrible service."}
{"text":"We've been here 4 times now and it never disappoints. The best cocktails I've ever had and I love the build your own antipasti plate. The servers are genuinely down to earth and real, always steer me to a delicious choice. Love love love the entertainment. Cover bands and acoustic guitar!"}
{"text":"I went to Culinary Dropout on the 14th after my graduation and it was awesome. Our server was Logan and we couldn't have had better service from him!! Not only was he friendly and full of life, but he also took the time to appeal to our party and purpose for being there. For me its all about service and he takes the cake with his ability to take all of our orders, share his personal preferences and opinions, and be playful with our sarcastic banter!! Aside from the service, the food was so delicious- not a single complaint, the drinks were plentiful and varied, and the prices were decent! They have a free valet service so we took advantage of that, too! I'll be back and hope to have Logan as our server again... (for research if you're reading this, Logan! haha).

I had the jalapeño honey lemonade which tasted so fresh and perfectly spiced; wings; pretzel bites which I presume to be a popular fave; shrimp caesar salad; the homage chips were great and so were the mussels!"}
{"text":"Snore. If you have three of the same restaurants, at least try and do something different at each one (besides ping pong). So, once you go to one Fox place, there is no incentive to visit any other. Additionally, Happy Hour has been slashed to only 3-5pm? This decision eliminates serving HH to the people who deserve it most - people who work until 5pm. It is a pretty dramatic increase in food prices when HH ends, but plenty of cheap beers still abound.They have House beer ( a can) or PBR for 3 bucks or a bagged mystery beer for 2 bucks, so it's a decent place for cheap drinks. Also, please hire a female bartender, having eight bearded males prowling the bar is a bit too much testosterone for myself."}
{"text":"Really great vibe, popular place.   Servers very professional and took great care of my son and I for lunch. 
Our take-home box of pretzels accidentally got thrown out in the kitchen, and they made more fresh, for us to take with us.   I'd recommend to everyone!   Pretzels & Fondue, as well as Burger were delicious."}
{"text":"Very good food. Small portions. Restaurant Web site deseptive.  Our backyard has better furniture and we don't charge $28 for six ounces of steak and a couple potatoes. Your bill will have an eight percent tax added if you are there when live music is played. I have had worse experiences, but our bill of $185 for four entrees and adult beverages left us feeling like fleeced tourists."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my family here last night. Everything was amazing. Definitely try the bread w/ olive oil and the pretzels w/ provolone fondue. For antipasti, the tomatoes are very good. For entrees I had the bistro steak which was good. 

Service was good, quick and friendly. (Maybe a little too quick)

Food: 5
Service: 4
Total: 4.5 rounds up"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and each time its gets better and better!  Love \"Ma the Meatloaf\"!  I also had the chicken meatballs I love their approach on this, its has the same components as a eating boneless wings.  The paper bag special is always amusing ha ha and the atmosphere is always the same!  Great food and such a great atmosphere!!!  Its definitely a must if your in that area."}
{"text":"Terrible experience from start to end. Hoestesses have no idea what they are doing . Bartenders are rude. The manager has terrible customer service. He has no clue how to treat his customers. we waited 3 hours and were quoted 2. They lost our reservstion. He was supposed to help our large party, pretty much accused me of lying and never came back to our table. We could have spent hundreds of dollars there but we were so mad we left. We will never be back. First time experience was horrible."}
{"text":"Friday night fantastic....... this place is great. Atmosphere, food, vibe, service, music, location, Culinary Dropout has it all. Given the fact that we had a party of 30, my expectations were that of chaos. It couldn't have gone any smoother. The sampling of appetizers were all delicious. On the basic side, hot pretzel balls dipped in a very mild fondue appealed to everyone, the hummus was unique and fresh, while the wings blended a complex array of flavors any foodie would enjoy. Fried chicken and 36 hour smoked ribs top the comfort food list if that's your mood, or dive deeper into the menu for something more exotic. Top it all off with live music and great cocktails for a truly enjoyable evening. Give this place a try"}
{"text":"This place has everything you want in a hipster restaurant.  The space has a very open feel and the bar and restaurant are divided in sections that just feel right.  The food was quality and cooked correctly, but boring.

The food was a little LCD for my taste. (least common denominator = great for the whole family).  BBQ was tame, the coleslaw was nice, the fries were good, and the fried chicken was fine.  It almost seemed healthy.  This menu needs a kick in the tail!  The sleeper must awaken!"}
{"text":"Dined at CD on Wednesday night. As always, it was an excellent experience. Our server Kat was really funny, attentive, and awesome. She recommended some cocktails and food for my group. Ambiance was upbeat and the food/drinks were delicious. I will definitely be coming back to see Kat and to get some soft pretzels!"}
{"text":"No wonder their name it culinary dropout. No problen living up to their title. Frozen food. You might as well go ti mcdonalds for a big mac Instead of having their Mac burger. Absolutely horrible food. Beer overpriced. Careless waitresses. Managers are useless but never helpful. Theres a hundres other restaurants much better in a milr radius"}
{"text":"I sooo want to love this place. It has a great atmosphere, good service, but the food is just alright... My husband and I have tried several dishes on multiple occasions. I give up."}
{"text":"4 stars for the yummy food. Upped it to 5 based on the yummy drink I had and the way-above-average service for a casual place such as this."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is great and so is the live music. I celebrated my birthday here back in June. The waitress couldn't have been any nicer. Will be back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! Huge space with lots of tables and an area with corn hole and ping pong tables. The food was excellent!"}
{"text":"My friend and I got a bottle of the Cabernet, Napa Valley, CA. It was delicious! We ordered a few appetizers, the Lemon Garlic Hummus, deviled eggs, and fried pork skins. They had a DJ the night I went and it was so much fun dining outside in the patio area with the misters on. Our server was very friendly and attentive to us, thumbs up Fox."}
{"text":"Lovely place to chill and hang out. Tons of places to eat in the same area. It's like a upscale bar area."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with friends recently.  We had to sit outside in winter weather due to it being busy -- heating lamps don't quite cut it.  Had the pretzels with fondue which was OK (cheese was not that warm).  Had a salad which was good.  I like the ambience of the interior."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend while visiting from Dallas. We were just having cocktails which were very strong and tasty, but ordered the soft pretzels and provolone fondue. Best. Fondue. Ever. In my opinion; I've never had a cheese fondue so flavorful and the perfectly baked pretzel bites were so perfect dipped in the melty deliciousness. The service was great and I definitely want to go back and try even more of their yummy creations!"}
{"text":"Okay if you haven't been to Culinary Dropout your missing out! Everything in the menus is mouth watering. The best part is how different it is, it's not just your average dinner place the menus is truly unique and amazing! Love having parties here and taking family to have a fun night out. Also the portions are huge so your get your money worth! Highly recommend going! You'll never find a place like it."}
{"text":"Good food, happy hour starts too early and ends at 5 PM but understandavle due to it's location in downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"We stopped in to grab a few drinks and some apps at happy hour. Old fashioned was lovely - sangria was also pretty good (huge plus that it was not full of useless fruit - just a little sweet for my personal taste). Pork belly nachos and chicken/shrimp skewer were both quite tasty. Bartenders were talented but not particularly friendly. Overall, this place has a cool vibe. 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"I went to Culinary dropout for the first time a few weeks ago.  We were with a big group, celebrating a friend's birthday.  What an awesome atmosphere and place to relax with friends!

To start off, we shared the pretzel fondue which was simply delicious.  The pretzel balls are soft and cooked to perfection as is the provolone fondue.  It was a great appetizer to hold us over before our meal.  

Most of us got cocktails, which were equally as yummy, although a little pricey.  I think my drink was $10 so I had to make sure to savor it.  

For my dinner, I ordered the house made fettuccine.  Yum!  No complaints here either.  The portion was very generous...I couldn't even finish it!  

I'd highly recommend going to Culinary Dropout to anyone!"}
{"text":"When you're trapped in a hotel for a week for a convention, you hope it's one with decent food. I don't have a lot of great things to say about the Hard Rock, but this restaurant is one of them. You feel like you're in a hipster joint in the cool, up-and-coming neighborhood rather than in the back of a smoky casino. Definitely start with the pretzel rolls, and take the staff's recommendations on drinks. Some of the fare is common, but some of it is uncommonly good---like the pierogies. Having grown up in the pierogi capital of the world, I certainly couldn't pass them up. I'm so glad I tried them, as they were delish! My friends enjoyed their sandwiches and salads (though the small house salad isn't anything to write home about and I didn't finish it). Overall, a great atmosphere and great food, if you happen to be out that way."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hang out, eat, drink beer and just relax. Pretzels and beer cheese are awesome."}
{"text":"Glad to see a newer dining selction inside the Hard Rock. Culinary Dropout fits in nicely between the ultra casual Lucky's 24/7 Diner and the much higher end NOBU and 35 Steaks and Martini on the HR property. Culinary Dropout is more what I would describe as comfort food, they have a pretty decent menu that should suit most. Some freinds and I dropped in for a bite and ate outside poolside for lunch one afternoon. I went with an order of the hot pretzels with fondue dips and a turkey reuben, both were delish. Service was good too, I have no real complaints and would recommend this place to fellow Yelpers and freinds in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Great place for a team dinner with 20 employees - fast service, fun atmosphere, and the food was great.  Had the pretzels and cheese app, amazing butternut squash pasta and the monkey bread dessert was insane.  Others has the ribs and fried chicken - tasted and was outstanding."}
{"text":"Food was great. However the service was not. Had reservations for a party of 8 at 5:30 to celebrate graduate school. At 5:45 they told us any remaining guests had to hurry because there was another reservation at our table at 7. Very rude because what restaurant tells their paying guests to hurry up. Then, they sent another server over to remind us again 15 minutes later. Knowing very well they wouldn't kick us out of our seats, and we weren't done hanging out, we took our time and stayed. Around 7:30 a hostess came back to tell us that the party who reserved our table had arrived and we needed to leave. SO RUDE. If you have that many large reservations that calls for way better planning. Not being blatantly rude to your guests. Won't go back for a long time. Entitled undergrad employees who have no customer service abilities."}
{"text":"This Culinary Drop out is a really fun location. Connected to two other restaurants and a common area with sitting areas and games like ping-pong and bean toss its a really fun and energetic place to go. I love it, I really do and have been a couple times now. The staff and management are fantastic and do a great job with serving and keeping people happy. I only have two complaints. One is that the menu seems to have allot of sweet dishes. I'm a girl who loves sweet things but not on my main dishes. The meatloaf that my fiance had ordered came to our table with a sweet tomato based glaze of some kind, and my fried chicken was supposed to be drizzled in honey, which I ordered on the side. When we asked about why the meatloaf was sweet we were told that it was \"traditional\" meatloaf..... Well, I grew up having my mom's meatloaf being savory, not sweet. So maybe I'm not aware of this being common. Needless to say they removed it from out bill to accommodate us which was very nice. My second complaint is the cost of the drinks. 10.00 a pop across the board for mixed drinks is awfully hefty in my opinion for being a place that clearly attracts people in there 20's-late 30's. for a group of five, each having two drinks each is 100.00 dollars? ouch! Although there is nothing to say with the quality or quantity of the drinks. Overall I can say I will keep going back despite these two things. The pretzel bites are probably my favorite app to order and you can stick to cheaper beer and wine. They have bands on the weekend and its a place a cant stay away from."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Always enjoy happy hour after a spring training game. Draw back this year, all tables seem to become reserved as it approaches 5. We squeezed up to the bar and the tables mostly remained empty until we left at 6? 
We love beer in a bag...surprise brand, the pretzels and cheese and this year tried their house made cinnamon vanilla whiskey! yummmm Can't wait to be back in Phoenix next year for another stop in!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite spot in LV! Culinary Drop Out was one of the first places I discovered after moving to Las Vegas in May and I'm so glad I found it.

Their food is the best and you get a lot for your money! I've tried many different items on the menu and have never been disappointed. In addition to a fantastic menu, the atmosphere and service is what makes this restaurant a place I choose to frequent. The servers and bartenders are welcoming and super friendly, they really want you to have an awesome experience. Most evenings they have live music playing on stage, Good Day Ole is my fav. CDO is always on the top of my list for places to take visitors from out of town because it's a guarantee that we will enjoy great food/drinks and just have an overall fun time!"}
{"text":"Fantastic location, amazing food and a wide variety of cocktails to enjoy on the patio. I've ate several times at the Culinary Drop Out in Las Vegas, so I had high expectations for the waterfront location and I was not disappointed. Always a great experience!!"}
{"text":"We recently took our family who were visiting from out of town to Culinary Drop Out for dinner. It's always tough to narrow down places to eat with visitors in town because Phoenix has plenty of awesome spots to choose from. Culinary Drop Out was perfect... the service was in point and super friendly. Our table shared several items on the antipasti list and I had the fried chicken, it was soooo good! Everyone really enjoyed their food and had a blast!"}
{"text":"I did a lot of research to find a place to take my bosses to lunch since they are visiting from San Diego this week.  I did my research and this was close to my office and had great reviews so I decided to roll the dice.  I was absolutely not disappointed!  From the small plate appetizers to share to the wonderful salads we got for our entrees, everything was outstanding.  The service was friendly, the atmosphere was comfortable and the food was amazing!  I recommend the Antipasta salad.  The portion was just right and there was no shortage of meat and cheese so you had some in every bite!  Very happy and will definitely be taking my family here for dinner soon."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places in Phoenix, and I am never sad to go back. We went to the location at The Yard. The set up is just ideal. You have pre or post dinner activities in The Yard, ping pong, foosball, and corn hole. 

The food is delicious comfort food. We have went twice, just the two of us and then with friends. Both times we enjoyed the small plates. It was a great way to sample a few dishes. I would highly recommend the green chili cornbread and the prosciutto deviled eggs. I've had both the crispy shrimp caesar salad and the beer battered fish and chips. Both are great, depends whether you are looking for something healthier or to treat yourself. 

Also there is often live music, which was also on point."}
{"text":"Good Food, Drinks, Ping Pong, Corn Hole, Foosball, picture booth, and great service. What else do you need?! I truly recommend this location. We'll definitely be back. I recommend the Ribs, Brussel Sprouts and charred Broccoli. 

Shout out to our waiter, Patrick for taking care of us. 

This location is 'Primetime'!"}
{"text":"If you're at this place now reading this review...RUN!!!  

Where should I begin listing all the nightmares at this terrible place?  Slow service.  Awful food served in microscopic portions.  FOOD POISONING!  My friend and I ate there around 9:00 PM this past Wednesday.  After waiting at the bar for half an hour for a table, we ordered two entrees (steak tacos and trout).  Well, the food was terrible, both in quantity and quality.  The bill was equally egregious given how terrible the food and service were.  I got home about an hour later and started feeling really bad.  I spent the next few hours hurling my guts out over the toilet.  My friend texted me saying he was also feeling sick, and he called the restaurant to complain.  They told him they'd make a note of it and see if anyone else experienced the same problems that night--no apology, no comp for the garbage meal they served...nothing.  Thanks Culinary Dropout...now I know why you're called a dropout!"}
{"text":"Dined here late at night (11:30pm) and was impressed with the service despite being so close to closing. My partner and I shared a bottle of newton cab which was a juicy delicious cab, she got the salad with apples (I forgot what it was called) and she really enjoyed it. I ordered the prime rib dip which I really enjoyed. The service from Tony and the rest of the bar staff was top notch and left a great impression on me as I did not have one from a different fox restaurant. Coming to this fox restaurant really changed my mind for the better."}
{"text":"Favorite menu items:

-Pretzels & Fondue (half off on happy hour M-F 3-6) The BEST pretzels I have ever had!
-Shaved prime rib dip
-Pork belly cubano
-Monkey bread

Everything on the menu is yummy though. For a drink I highly recommend the clown punch. The pomegranate foam is so unique and delicious.

The decor here is awesome and service has always been very attentive!"}
{"text":"I have to start by saying there was a weird vibe about the place- like 4 hostesses waiting for us, a couple big security guards walking around... It just doesn't have much of an inviting ambiance like the one in Scottsdale does. But we kind of got over that once we were seated.  

So my boyfriend and I started with the house-made potato chips and french onion dip. These were SO good and I'd definitely recommend ordering them while you wait for your meal. 
We ordered the Thai chicken wings... So, we're both from the South and we're kind of wing/bbq snobs so maybe we're being picky. But these just were not good. They were pretty slimy and a little bloody as if they weren't cleaned well enough or cooked long enough. However, our waiter was VERY nice and accommodating when we asked if we could order something else instead. We got the fish & chips which came out pronto. They weren't bad, maybe a 3/5.

Overall our waiters and the staff we encountered were very nice and helpful. This place was not horrible by any means, but I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Food done well in a fun atmosphere. Super friendly service. Nice sized portions unique fair for any palate. Only wish I had more time  to eat here again."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of dining at Culinary Dropout the other Saturday night with friends and I have to say wow! The complex is huge and has several other restaurants there (Little Cleo's seafood and Barrio urban) Our server 'Connors' mentioned to us about how amazing the fondue is, I mean who doesn't want some delicious salty pretzels and cheese to dip in?! He also mentioned about the selection of charcuterie boards with various meats, cheeses, snacks - we decided to share a few items like prosciutto and bread with manchengo and goat cheese! Yum! I highly recommend for a fun evening out and also explore the fun games in the back! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"I had the most wonderful experience celebrating a new job promotion here. I had a big group of 8 but our server Lucy did a wonderful job taking all our orders and making sure we were taken car of. She was funny, sweet, and attentive to all my friends. I was also very impressed with some manager named Andrew. I've never seen a manager working the guest area and checking in with all the tables along with helping out the servers. He was efficient yet took a few minutes to say hi to my friends and asked us what we were celebrating. He seemed very genuine and really tried to make sure we had a positive experience. I'm so glad I came here with my big group and would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"It was very crowded as the evening went on, and we had a table of 11, but service was still very good, the food was really good, and they make a killer Moscow Mule!! I would definitely go back to this restaurant!! We had a lot of seperate checks, and that even came out right! Very impressed :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love to go to Culinary Dropout for a relaxed environment with some great food. I recommend going there with a completely empty stomach and a ginormous appetite. 

The first thing I suggest there is the The Clown Punch (for two of course!) It is served in a huge glass, with two straws! It tastes like fruity deliciousness, but it's not a pansy fruity drink, the BF likes it too! And it comes with some sort of foam on top that adds great texture and taste! I have yet to try their Antipasti platters where you can choose your meats, cheeses, vegetables and snacks, but I heard it is amazing as well. 

As an appetizer, I highly recommend the Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue - the best appetizer in my opinion! Think of light fluffy balls of perfectly cooked pretzels lightly salted that you can dip into a provolone fondue...it is just to die for! And the cheese comes with a little candle lit underneath it so it doesn't get hard and you can continue to munch on it throughout your meal. I do recommend splitting it with two to three people because you want to save room for the great entrees! 

For our main meal we love to split the M.A.C. Burger which is very tasty as well! It is Culinary Dropout's version of a Big Mac. One of my favorite parts is the really light fluffy bread they use for the bun - sometimes its the care that you put into making the bread that can make a dish really stand out. Add that to a delicious meat patty with cheese and lettuce and you have got a killer combo. It comes with a side of fries that are perfectly cooked - not mushy or soggy or burnt. Just cooked to perfection.  If you get the M.A.C. burger, you are definitely getting bang for your buck!

As for dessert, a must try is the Apple Monkey Bread. It is baked to order (always a plus). If you enjoy a really great sweet treat at the end of a meal - you're in luck!  

Besides the delicious food, there are other things that keep us coming back to Culinary Dropout. First, the service is great. You have waiters and waitresses that know the menu, appreciate a good meal, can make great suggestions (which I always love), and literally have you want to try different things on the menu from their great descriptions. I also love love love the decor in the restaurant. It's a very sexy restaurant with all the huge chandeliers, and at some tables you have huge chairs that you would imagine kings and queens sit in! In my pinon it all adds to your experience at Culinary Dropout. 

This restaurant is an absolute must-try and one of my favorites in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great energy, big place. Casual and fun. Nice bar, pong pong and corn hole while you wait. Fun comfort food type of menu. Everything was good! 
Ribs, fish and salads were great. Finished off with the delicious monkey bread."}
{"text":"The food is good if a little over priced. The whole Boho, Millenial Hipster vibe seems a little bit of an affectation."}
{"text":"Been to this place several times..the drinks are good and the food is even better. Try the house made chips with dip or the pretzels with fondue as a starter. You'll think me later.  For entrees the pork ribs are really good and the fried chicken with biscuit and honey is even better.  They have a great happy hour Monday-Friday 3-6. Cheap drinks and 50% off apps.  Come hungry and thirsty!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, great food, great drinks and atmosphere. The bar staff could not have treated us better. The ranch dressing is absolutely to die for. Please someone send me the recipe .."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I was recommended this place by a friend who was traveling to Phoenix, who raved about it.  Again, we went early- I think around 3 or 4 (6-7p OH time) so we made it for happy hour.  It was hot! But we decided to sit outside under the shade and near the misting fans, and it was very comfortable.  The outdoor area is very cool and seems like a great place to get drinks and hang out with a group.   We ordered the pretzels and fondue as an appetizer and it was a huge portion! We also ordered the kale and butternut squash salad and fried chicken to share (it's all about balance!).  Everything was delicious!  The chicken was crisp, and flavorful, and the biscuit was amazing! The mashed potatoes were okay, and slaw was warm due to the heat and everything else warm on the plate.  The salad had a lot going on, but was really good! It was a \"softer\" kale than I typically have, so not sure if it was baby kale or what.  The service was great, the only downfall is they give such tiny glasses for water, which in 90+ heat, a bigger glass would be great!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch.  A little slow on delivery but well worth the wait.  I am sure it was slower because everything is hand made from scratch.  Service was good!"}
{"text":"Yum! Best spot for a relaxing time with absolutely yummy food! Mussels are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch around 12:45pm. Wasn't busy at all.  Waiter was nice however they too a very long time to refill \"Bottomless\" mimosas, food was ok,  service is not great don't think I'd come back,   Check out DW Bistro, a bit far but food and service makes it worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to several Fox restaurants while on vacation in Scottsdale and this was the worst by quite a large margin. The food wasn't good and the service was terrible. I was also put off by how slutty the waitresses appeared."}
{"text":"Love the food here! The charcuterie plates are the best and their service is amazing. If you get a chance to go in, ask for Gary. He's exceptional and very knowledgeable about the menu. Their beer choices are amazing and they feature local breweries too which is always nice to try. Also their Moscow mule is so delicious. Last but not least the pretzel and cheese appetizer is to die for. They are warm and it comes with a cheese fondue. Be careful because if you eat too many you won't be hungry for the rest. Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Hard Rock or Vegas!"}
{"text":"Listen, 5 stars is a lot--I understand--but this place is awesome and it is in a great location at the Hard Rock!

AMBIENCE:  5 stars.  Great vibe, cool decor with lots of wood and metal and an awesome chilled seafood station, hip bar, and awesome patio with views of the pool.

SERVICE:  5 stars.  Similar to other places that require you to have a certain amount of flair a la' OFFICE SPACE, I think the servers and other workers here are required to have a certain amount of tattoos and piercings!  The service is excellent, the staff knows their menu inside and out.  The bartenders deserve special mention as their craft cocktail menu is really unique and really good!

FOOD:  5 stars.  Upscale bar/pub food!  The soft pretzels are homemade and served with a delicious cheese fondue. The fish and chips is AWESOME!  The chilled shrimp, oysters, etc, are great.  I have eaten here probably 5 times over the last two years and I have never been disappointed!

ALCOHOL:  5 stars.  Very creative and diverse bar menu.

OVERALL:  5 stars!  This place is a lot of fun, with great service and really good food!"}
{"text":"Me and my gfs came here 3 times. Service was great, friendly, and quick. Food was amazing. Loved everything about this place.

(we had the soft pretzels, 2 eggs any way, grilled cheese, breakfast sandwich, and chicken sandwich - all great!)"}
{"text":"Go during happy hour the food is reduced prices and smaller portions but you get to try so many amazing food. Its worth it for.the food must try the beet salad and pretzels"}
{"text":"The food is great and the apps are well priced and very good. The beet and cheese app is amazing and the monkey bread is great."}
{"text":"Food is always great- get the fondue pretzels and you won't regret it. Great atmosphere, drinks, and food- get the fondue pretzels and you won't regret it. I also had a blueberry beer here and it was awesome! It's fun during the day or night."}
{"text":"Great food here. Try the corn ravioli and the Gorgonzola chicken salad."}
{"text":"Great spot in the Hard Rock. We grabbed dinner here before Magic Mike and it was perfect! Matt was our server and he couldn't have been better -- he was fun and had great recommendations. I had the perogies... to die for... and the house made chips and onion dip... also really good. They also had oyster shooters, which were really unique!"}
{"text":"We had a 5:45pm reservation and arrived at 5:30pm.  Despite there being open tables, the host told us we had to wait until our time.  So we stood there and watched the open tables and had a bunch of people seated before us.  Lo and behold, after waiting 15 minutes, we were seated at one of those open tables.  WHAT???  Insulting.  They never called us - apparently I was supposed to know they were going to text me; phone is in my purse and it is noisy in there so I didn't hear a thing. Finally seated and the waiter was great, but the typical wait way too long for the check and the payment processing.  

The food was mediocre.  Appetizers over $10 and food over $20.  I had the nachos and they were okay - I wouldn't order them again.  Friend had the meatloaf and said it was good.  Two other friends had burgers and they were just ordinary - and very salty. 

I have no idea why everyone loves this place.  The place is in Tempe, so the college crowd probably loves it."}
{"text":"The ribs are delicious! The have the perfect rub that provides a bit of spice and the BBQ sauce that give the sweet texture to the ribs. This by far one of my favorite locations for ribs. The atmosphere is very casual and enjoyable. The staff is very friendly and the fried chicken was a little dry but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I spent the Fourth of July in Phoenix because I had to catch a plane the next morning. We were looking for someplace nice to mark the holiday and also celebrate our honeymoon. (But remember, we're from Tucson, so our definition of \"nice\" is a little different.)

We'd been to a few of the other Fox restaurants and wanted to try something new. Culinary Dropout was open late, and their menu looked fun.

We certainly got what we bargained for -- classic comfort foods with a twist set in an alternative atmosphere that was really enjoyable. Initially, we were worried the place was over-hyped (lots of tattooed hipsters and a dining room that could have been featured in a Rock 'n Roll issue of Dwell magazine. Luckily the decor was a compliment to the food instead of a distraction.

We got the pretzel bites with provolone fondue for an appetizer, then my husband got the meatloaf and I got the fried chicken for dinner. Ho-le-cow the food was good. I mean totally delicious and better than Mom makes (sorry, Mom).

The service was great and the food was really something to write home about. We'd definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"The vibe here is laid back, in a trendy way. The waitstaff has a polished edge to them, if that's possible. And the food has just traditional fair done gastro-pub style. I feel like a hipper person for just knowing this place exists.

I've been here many times, typically for drinks and apps but occasionally for dinner as well. Tonight I was here for a company dinner for about 10 of us. It was a 5 star evening. Not all my experiences have been 5 star here, but they were on it tonight. Bravo CD!!

The waitress was helpful and accessible while never obtrusive. Our meals all arrived at the same time. The water was refilled at half empty (or half full?). I ordered the seared tuna salad and enjoyed every bite. A few extra prices of tuna would have been nice, but for $15 I definitely got my money's worth. 

The bathrooms were clean, spacious, and had flattering mirrors and lighting. 

Coming back isn't a question for me. Great place!"}
{"text":"The decor was pretty cool (very Scottsdale).  Food was excellent - braised short rib pasta = superb.  Corn pasta dish was very good.  Biggest surprise was the service.  The wait for food was somewhat long - 30 min or so, but they repeatedly apologized and gave us free carrot cake for the wait.  Service industry in Scottsdale has come a long way.  If you are in the area, you must stop in here."}
{"text":"This is a very cool place! The food was outstanding. I highly recommend the ribs. We also had a fabulous waitress. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super trendy, yummy, & great location.

This place has an overall fun, hipster vibe. They poke fun at themselves with menu items like the \"cheap house salad\" and \"ma.. the meatloaf!\" (A la Vince Vaughn in Wedding Crashers). 

I had the Gorgonzola chicken salad which was light and fresh and all around delightful.

They had a hearty selection of cocktails, which is always an A+ in my book. 

Bonus: prime location on the outside of Scottsdale Fashion Square. 

Stop by if you are in the mood for good food & good drinks (so basically anytime ever!)."}
{"text":"Disappointing visit. Not as good as the Scottsdale restaurant. Ordered the pretzels and fondue, 36-hour pork ribs, and bistro steak.

The cheese for the fondue tasted processed. I liked the concept of the appetizer and the plating was fun. It's a great social food. However, the quality was poor.

The bistro steak was OK. I didn't feel that it was a great value. Small quantity and all you get for a side is fries? It looked like a sirloin cut. I would have rather gone to [a popular family steakhouse] and got their 8 oz sirloin meal. It would have been more meat, better quality, tasted better, and more sides for a well-rounded meal. I swapped the fries for green beans and they were served under-cooked. They still had a pretty fibrous texture.

The 36-hour pork was the greatest disappointment. The meat was overcooked. Extremely chewy. I had a hard enough time breaking up the ribs with a knife.That was really sad because we came back specifically for this meal. Last time, at the Scottsdale location, the meat simply fell off the bones. The sauce was still great.

Parking at this location is horrendous. There is no self-parking nearby. The three restaurants share a complimentary valet service, which is a nice perk. If you'd rather park yourself, plan on parking across 7th St in the Basha's lot and walking.

This is just my opinion, but I feel that the meals are overpriced. I think you're paying for the location and atmosphere. Definitely a fun place for a night out. Since there's three restaurants at this location with combined seating, it's a huge and loud crowd. It's a trendy restaurant with an urban feel. 

The only compliment I can give for this trip was the service. Our glasses were always full and we were able to pay quick and get the heck out."}
{"text":"Melissa had Fried Chicken, mashed potatoes, and a biscuit. I had deviled eggs, monkey bread, and Thai chili chicken wings. Deviled eggs were a little salty for my taste. Everything else was great, and very fresh. Lots of things on the menu that I'd like to try. 
If you like people watching, this is the best place. The place is busy, and a lot larger than expected. People of all ages, but mainly ASU students. Lots of pretty girls wearing revealing clothes, so thumbs up for that too. Very entertaining place to eat. They also have corn hole and ping pong..."}
{"text":"Kitchen Dropout.  Service Dropout.  Bartender Dropout.  Absolutely no one graduated from this White Trash University.

A group of about 15 of us came here for a business lunch, which brings up an important point here: This is not a business appropriate place.  Extremely loud music, and a meal takes about two (2) hours to complete.

Three of us left without ever receiving our meals.  Or an explanation.  There was no manager on duty, and just a couple potentially intoxicated servers and busboys left to look dumbfounded as we asked for water.

The whole experience was like an episode of Jerry Springer unfolding before my eyes, but with inedible cheese fondue and spoiled artichokes.  

Make no mistake, this is overpriced pool food, except it's wretched.  It just reeks of desperation.  There's not much left to say."}
{"text":"Great fun place to grab some good food and drink.  Pretzel bites are amazing. I also had the green chili stew.  I was very happy with both.  Nice beer selection.  Not a lot of choices but a good variety.  Chicken wings were really tiny so that was a lesson learned. Our server Anna was very attentive without hovering.  She kept us in food and drink on a very busy Saturday evening. 
we will be back."}
{"text":"I am surprised to see that CD has 4 stars on average.  Of the three times I have eaten there, only one time did we have good service.  Last time we were there, our server forgot to order my drink and tried to blame it on the bar.  I waited 30 min for my first drink.  I reminded the waiter after 15 min and it took another 15 to get it.  He also ordered the wrong meal for my boyfriend, and the others in our party waited a very long time for their drinks, too.  It was hard to order a second drink because our waiter was no where to be found.  The waiter didn't comp anything after messing up the orders.  The food was mediocre.  CD seems too big for the staff to give even adequate service.  Now when friends suggest meeting there, I suggest other restaurants."}
{"text":"I have to ask; \"Doesn't Phoenix have enough restaurants like this already?\" Take one old warehouse/bank/lumber yard, install a couple of rolling garage doors and other miscellaneous industrial fixtures. Recruit a contingent of full beards, skinny jean clad staff and you are in business. There are several other places on Central that offer similar fare, the Windsor, Joy Ride etc. Anyway, food wasn't terrible, wifey had a prime rib sandwich, and I had canneloni, both were very average and a bit overpriced. Valet parking only for some reason? I noticed a lot of BMWs in the lot so they must be attracting the kind of clientele they need."}
{"text":"Really cool vibe here. It's dimly lit inside. I went on a Saturday late night and there was plenty of seating. They had a band playing cover songs. I sat at the bar, the staff was friendly. I had the chicken sliders. They were delicious, cheesy with chicken and tomatoes. Three sliders come on the plate with fries. They have valet parking but I parked down the road at the Nordstrom's parking structure, it's about half a block down on Camelback and Goldwater."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting Vegas for a few days and decided to try Culinary Dropout since it was in our hotel. Not only was the food amazing but our waitress, RaeAnn, was the most helpful and nicest waitress we've ever had. She chatted with us about why were visiting, suggested delicious items, and treated us like friends. I would go back to this specific location just to have her as my server again."}
{"text":"I went here with my friends and family. We all got pretzels which are delicious. But there are really fun games to play like cornhole, ping pong, foosball, and shuffleboard. But if you are under the age of 21 then you can't be in the games area past 6. Which is garbage because little kids come here to play with there parents. There is also a lounge area for you to watch tv. Also for the bathrooms you can walk into whatever gender door. You will see when you get there. Overall it's pretty good and I recommend trying it out for yourselves."}
{"text":"I searched for a restaurant for lunch that was not on the Vegas strip. Although this is in a casino hotel. it was so much more reasonably priced, and the food was better than other food that we had on our visit to Las Vegas. The service was also very friendly. I'm so glad we visited and wish we had time to go back"}
{"text":"Me and my wife came here for a late lunch. First of all, our server Shon was phenomenal. All the food here is fresh and made on site. Shon talked me into the fried chicken and I'm glad I listened. It was awesome. All the food on the menu is reasonably priced and very filling. The restaurant has a nice feel to it and is well decorated and very open. The great food and location was just made even better by what a great server Shon was. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fun environment, great fun service. Fabulous ribs and fried chicken. Flexible host stand and friendly staff throughout."}
{"text":"Happy hour here rocks!  M-F 3-6pm they have a variety of appetizers including meatloaf sandwiches ($6), grilled cheese sliders (3 sliders $6), pretzels with cheese ($4) and fries ($3).  The drink specials are pretty fair by LV standards with $4 wells and $3 PBR mugs.  The service was fast, and I liked the laid back atmosphere here.  It was a great place to start off our night with tasty food and a few drinks.

The meatloaf sandwich was delicious!! It has a ketchup reductions that was sweet and savory, perfectly complementing the soft egg bun and tender meat.  The grilled cheese sliders were nicely toasted and tasty as well.  Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for a work party the other night with 30+ people. It was a hell of a time. Someone from my office pre-planned our entire menu, which was a bummer at first since I wanted to order a bunch of stuff, but they ended up picking a bunch of good stuff so it worked out. 

Food:

Pretzel Bread & Cheese Dip - BEST. EVER. I basically filled up on these...
Thai Chili Chicken Wings - Best chicken wings I've had tbh
House Potatoes & Onion Dip - Needed waaaaaay more dip
Turkey Pastrami Sliders - More pretzel bread win but kinda dry.
Grilled Cheese Sandwiches - Just okay. Nothing extraordinary.
Roasted Garlic Hummus - Also just okay. I got sick of bread at this point.

Drinks:

After School Special - 7/5 - Cocktail AND Beer? Yes. 
Velvet Death 5/5 - Gin everything always please.
Room Service - 100/5 - I think I ordered 4 of these. So good...

Place had awesome energy and entertainment. I wish we had these or anything even remotely like these in California! Great vibes, foods and drinks. I hope to go back before my trip is over and try out more stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"We had the asparagus (delish), artichoke (good but my personal issue of never knowing how to eat it) and the house specialty of fried chicken which was really good and huge portion 4 pieces so totally shareable. Ok selection on beer but the bacon bloodymary looked good. Loved the ambiance right up my alley being from Portland Oregon."}
{"text":"Even on a Friday night at 8:30, we were seated within 5 minutes (we booked a reservation online for 9 PM). Our server, Martin, was wonderful. He remembered details of our order, was friendly and attentive when he needed to be. Very cool atmosphere, although I left with half my hearing and half my voice from the extreme noise. Not to sound like a 90-year-old telling them to tone down that racket, but the music was so loud and we were seated at an awkward 2-top in between other tables. Thus between the large party next to us on either side within inches and the music a few feet away, all we could do is stare awkwardly at each other and text from across the table to communicate. Now, that's a hot date! 

The music was good and started just after 9 PM on a Friday(picture of stage). I wish they had placed the stage in the patio/party area and built a designated little dance floor because we would have jammed out for a bit since we couldn't talk or function with the noise otherwise. 

I ordered a classic mule drink (which was not as sweet as usual elsewhere) and my husband got the brown bag special(a random, surprise can of beer). This was a cool, cheap concept and you get to try a beer you otherwise would not have picked. He liked it a lot! 

Due to the soft pretzel hype and our unhealthy love of fake cheese, we got the pretzel app. Wanted to love it but were disappointed. The cheese wasn't melted or warm and had no flavor. The pretzels were much bigger than anticipated (more like small roll size) and were a good consistency. Unfortunately, they didn't have any flavor. Quick dip in butter or salt would have added a little something. 

For entrees, we had fish and chips and the pub burger. The burger was juicy and flavorful with an awesome smokey taste to the meat. The fish was pretty good with a bit of a spice, but the slaw was probably the best part of the dish. Both meals came with cold, seasoning-free, limp fries that had clearly been sitting for awhile and a tiny tin bowl with a squirt of ketchup. I would recommend a different side. 

We were bummed that all of the bags and ping pong areas were taken. Assuming these are open more frequently at off peak times of day. As an FYI, we were carded twice for entry. Not sure if this is only for weekends or other times as well. Food runners seemed very disorganized. We were asked three times if an item they were holding was something we ordered. They asked all the tables around us. 

Overall, we are glad we tried this place but are not itching to go back...at least not on a weekend when it is so loud and busy. 
We were not impressed enough with the food for the price."}
{"text":"We had 9pm reservations. They finally sat us at 9:25.    

I am going to sound like an old man.   Because after all, I am 54.   Last night we had a party of 14. The live band was so loud everyone just sat there for the entire time and stared at each other.  Occasionally trying to read each other's lips.   Food was delayed.    But as always, it was awesome.  Meatloaf was especially good.   As was the fried chicken. 

But the band was a miss.   They pretty much cleared everyone out.  It was hard rock that was as loud as any concert I've been to.   My ears are still ringing the next day.   We will return but only if they nix the band."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss depending on what you order.  Hip vibe and good happy hour menu.  If i'm in the neighborhood, I'd go again, but it's not worth it to drive here.  Service was pretty good, servers were attentive enough.

What I had:
Pretzel Fondue
Pretzel balls can be a little more chewy and softer, but the molten cheese for dipping is quite fun.  

Port Salut
Semi-soft, creamy, and delicious with their baguette.

Jamon Iberico
Acorn fed, free=-range, black hoof pig....so they say...It was delicious and thin, but were sliced with a machine!!  They weren't hand carved by an experienced jam on handler...but then again, this is Phoenix.  What do I expect?

Grilled Cheese Sliders
These were \"slider\" sized or personal size grilled cheese that were not so mini.  Crispy outside, fluffy and cheesy inside.  From their happy hour menu.

Korean Shrimp & Chicken Stick
I don't know what's \"Korean\" about this, but the marinade was spicy.  The veggies were also very spicy and good.  The chicken could've been more juicy, but the overall dish was pretty good.

Smoked Salmon Bruschetta
My fav item.  With pickled pink onions, tomato, capers, and olive oil.  Tangy, smokey, crispy.  Addictive!

36-Hour Pork Ribs
Full rack of baby back ribs that are slow cooked for 36 hours and basted with sweet and spicy jalapeno and molasses sauce.  Served with fries and yummy coleslaws!  The sauce was very tasty, but there were some spots on the rib that were too salty for some reason.  Then there were other parts that weren't salty.  Perhaps the chef literally threw a handful of salt on the ribs!?"}
{"text":"This place is a good improvement for Hard Rock! Very nice indoor and outdoor seating options. I had a great experience here with very friendly staff! I had the pretzel with cheese fondue appetizer and it was yummy! You have to try the Monkey Bread dessert! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I have had the enthusiastic suggestion to visit Culinary Dropout from quite a few people, and today I decided to indulge. upon entering the restaurant, on the right, you are faced with a long hallway covered in black and white pictures of chefs, food, and various other gastronomical items. to the left of the podium is an oyster bar. The chairs and  tables have almost a rustic / disheveled look to them. each table has their own set of seat backs and seats that don't match the others. There are large glass chandeliers hanging above the larger tables, and I counted 3 small fire pits on the patio. There is also a full service bar to the right of the dining room.

I was offered a seat at the bar, but requested a table in the dining area. After being seated a waitress by the name of Rae (I hope I remember correctly) approached, greeted, and sat down at the table to discuss the menu (since it was my first visit.)

This is the type of hospitality and customer service that I really look for in a restaurant. After explaining what she liked and helping me through some of the things I fancied, we both decided that she would just bring some food and I would eat. When the food arrived it was just simple food on a plate. no pretentious arrangements, no rediculous garnish, that's not intended to be eaten, just good food prepared well.

Her attentiveness is really what made the experience for me. Super down to earth/chill people, showing that you actually care for guests is what sets this place apart.

After paying the bill I was even give a to-go beverage, when again, I didn't ask for or expect, but it was the thought that counted.

I would highly recommend this place, especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"It is a joy to find covered parking in Scottsdale in July. Easy access to Culinary Drop out without melting on the sidewalks, elevator B.  Very welcoming atmosphere and employees. Food was very good, had to have the Pretzel Bites and they are as good as everyone says.  Ordered the Prime Rib Dip and Pub Burger and they were delicious.  Our waitress was fairly attentive.  With the amount of customers there getting drinks seemed kind of slow but over all pretty good.  The only real knock is the noise level.  Unable to speak to or hear across the table. Made having a group (4) conversation pretty much impossible. Dropped in around 2 PM on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Live band on the weekends. Fresh oysters and delicious late night food. The service was fast and friendly, not a bad word to say about the place."}
{"text":"The nachos were saltier than the ocean. The grilled cheese sliders tasted like old Kraft Cheese. #disappointed"}
{"text":"I've been to one in Austin and now this one. The drinks are kind of weird, the atmosphere is awesome and the appetizers are really good. The French dip wasn't great but the ribs are good. The bacon Bloody Mary was too bacon-ey."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, and perhaps one of the only reasons to ever visit the Hard Rock Hotel for my family / friends / co-workers.  The charcuterie seafood and salads are amazing, it would be great if they could add 1-2 more entrees to the mix.  But the fried chicken is probably my favorite in Las Vegas (maybe Lagasse Stadium is tied).  Great place."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere and although the dish that my fiancée and I are obsessed over is their pretzel rolls and cheese. We will go out of our way just to get those bad boys. I would highly recommend this for an afternoon/weekend date night. Although it does get rather busy and loud on weekends because of their LIVE music, it's worth it for the experience."}
{"text":"The chips were awesome....the pretzel bread with provolone fondu was AWESOME, the fried chicken was juicy and sweet...the almond rainbow trout was great, and the biscuit with the chicken was phenomenal.  Don't know how this place is just a 4 star? Wow."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Phoenix to hang with friends in the lounge, to catch some live music with Vinyl Station, or to celebrate life events. The food is divine comfort food and of course the pretzels & fondue are a must!! Delicious cocktails and a paperbag beer are a fantastic accompaniment to any dish. Staff is always friendly and accommodating. A must for all."}
{"text":"Tonight was our 2nd time dining at this establishment. 1st time was for opening weekend and we had the best time! Service was great, food was great, Kelley James band was awesome... wish I could say the same for our experience tonight.  Had reservations at 7:45, was promptly seated & then it all went downhill. We weren't even acknowledged by our waiter for 15 minutes.  When our spiky blonde H&M wearing waiter decided to give us the time of day we advised him we were ready to order or drinks & apps & our entree seeing as we were already sitting there for 15 minutes (no care in the world from him) 

Food... It turned into an over priced gastropubishh meal.  Had the chips & dip app ($7 for over-fried kettle chips) Mac burger (bun falling apart after each bite) turkey pastrami sandwich (decent) shrimp salad (recommend but still over priced at $15) oh and they are super stingy on the fries! 

Now back to our waiter - typically we tip 20% + but I honestly had a very hard time giving him even 10% sorry dude but you possibly gave us the worst service we have experienced in LV. 

Culinary Dropout I wish I could love you, I wish I could recommend you, but you simply just aren't a place for repeat customers.  You won't be seeing anymore of our $$$"}
{"text":"We dropped in here while cruising the Mill Ave district.  It is off the beaten path so you might want to use your GPS app.  It is well worth the visit.

It is in a building called the Yard in the Farmers Art District. (If you have never been to the Tempe downtown Mill Ave area about a block away it should be on your bucket list.)

We had a server named Alex who was exemplary.  A server can make or break your experience at a restaurant.  If you have a good one with great food, like we did, you'll tell a friend.  If you have a bad experience you'll tell ten friends.

Since he could tell that it was our first visit, he took time to go through the menu and give tips.  Also, when we placed our orders he asked if certain ingredients would be ok.  Two thumbs up.

When our wines were served, the person serving asked if we wanted to sample them first.  Another two thumbs up.  I wish that I had a dollar for places where the wine was terrible yet there was no such sample first procedure.

We had the garlic hummus & pita bread. (excellent)  The grilled chicken club was good but was heavy with the smoked ham and bacon.  Good, but I'd not order it again.  

Although we did not see live entertainment, they do offer it on several nights during the week.  With concrete floors you can tell it will be loud so be aware.  There was a sign for tailgate events prior to ASU football games.  It would probably be great but you might want to get a bike cab for the few blocks to the stadium.

Based on our experience we'll definitely return and try different dishes."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It has really good and really large portions.  I strongly recommend you don't miss out on the pretzels.  Lexie provided awesome service."}
{"text":"Decent.

We ventured here last weekend on the recommendation of someone who is local to Vegas.  The atmosphere fits right in with the Hard Rock.  It has a fairly open floor plan...which I like specifically for people watching.  The service that we had was really good...spot on and efficient.  The food was just decent, though.  We started with the pretzel appetizer...I didn't find this as appealing as other reviewers have.  I ordered the grilled cheese sliders for my entree...nothing special, but not bad either.

I would probably mention this place to a friend visiting Vegas and I would probably return."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Great happy hour, delicious food, and phenomenal customer service! 
My girlfriends and I go out every Tuesday night to enjoy happy hour. We try to find new places but tend to stick with Joyride because of the food and most importantly the service! 
The Yard/ Culinary Dropout surpassed our expectations! 
I tried their white sangria and it honestly wasn't very good and our server Kelvin made me feel completely okay, being honest and letting him know that! Then the manager, I believe, Kyle came over and talked to us about what we didn't like about the sangria and brought over a complimentary red sangria which was phenomenal!!! 
Overall it was an exceptionally good experience and we will absolutely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great concept. Lots of space, lots of interesting design elements, lots of wonderful choices on the menu. Very impressed at the level of service, especially since we inadvertently showed up close to closing time. Waiter had plenty of great suggestions, and the chefs obviously put in effort in spite of the late order.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've come here a half dozen times with different groups at a variety of times and it has always been a hit!  We come for work lunches and they are welcoming to large groups on separate checks.  We came with my family for new years and they had the full regular menu as well as a specials menu.  I also came for a late dinner and drinks with friends and it was a great hang out bar atmosphere.  Finally, we went with my mother in law who has extremely severe food allergies and they were informative of the ingredients in each item and very accommodating.  The wait staff is always polite, helpful and attentive.  The food and drinks are always delicious!  I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in this Friday afternoon for a couple of drinks and some small bites at the bar. When we came in the hostess said that it would be a 45 minute wait for a table which is to be expected in this area on this date at this time. However, the service left quite a bit to be desired. I understand trying to keep the flow going, but being asked if I needed a drink or if I was going to order dinner every two minutes got really old really fast. After the fourth tome being asked in 15 mins, I asked for the bill and abruptly left. Ugh, so annoying!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: I liked that they have a stage, upbeat music, happy hour and you can see the kitchen.  Re: Good looking staff:  We had a handsome waiter, the other young ladies are just average looking.  The chairs had worn out cushions and i sank in them. 

The food was good but a few discrepancies on the menu: 
The Butternut squash Cannelloni  is actually Ravioli! Do you reviewers not know the difference? And there was supposed to be corn, white asparagus and sugar snap or snow peas with included but were missing--they would have added to the overall taste, value and nutrition of the menu. 

Appetizers: ordered the mussels and got a great portion with a wonderful broth and superb toasty bread for dipping. A few of the mussels had an off taste though. 

Also a port cheese from France which I thought would have a port wine swirl through it but it was very tasty. Served with a berry jam, I would have preferred a crushed olive dipper. (for $4 I can't complain.)
Desert: carmel corn custard something or other, more than for one person. It was more sweet than an expected sweet and salty. 

Shared the entire meal and it came to 51.and change. Good deal for 2 ladies who are watching their calorie intake and want something different. 

Will be back for appetizers and happy hour. 
Of note: Again, I am a seasoned fish and chipper-- please serve malt vinegar at the table when serving. The coleslaw looked very healthy, not  mushy."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was absolutely delicious. The coleslaw seemed fresh and the honey biscuit was not too sweet. We had the nachos Adan appetizer and our server recommended we try them with half fries and half chips instead of all chips. Is recommendation was excellent. Place was great. They split up our salad and fried chicken entre onto two plates for us to share. Would definitely go back and have already recommended it to multiple friends who are traveling to the area for spring training!"}
{"text":"Fried Chicken and Waffles Done Right! Their Appetizers are awesome too! We had the brussels sprouts! Place was an absolute gem! They had a cornhole tournament being played outside and sports on every tv. Our waiter was knowledgable and helpful! Would Definitely go back! All of these Fox Restaurants have been excellent!"}
{"text":"It's okay. Food is good, pretzels and fondue were the best! My gf and I had a reservation and stood in line to be seated by the hostess. When we got to the front, they asked if we wanted to join their email list...rather than asking for our reservations and seating us. They assumed we were there with the 2 men in front of us, who had just sat down in the waiting area for their table. Is it possible that two adult women had gone to the restaurant on their own agency and accord without the company of men? What a crazy concept. LOL"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fantastic and the menu looked great. Unfortunately sat at the bar for 20 minutes, took 5 minutes to get menu and could never place an order. A lot of staff, asked to place order and they kept passing the buck. Phoenix does an amazing job so will wait til I'm back in that city."}
{"text":"The inside of this restaurant (while loud) is super fun and wonderfully decorated. We were seated quickly inside (would have been a much longer wait for outside).

Our waiter (who looked like all the other waiters!) was fun and did a nice job. I had the ricotta gnocchi (over the prime rib pasta at the waiter's suggestion) and it was great. My parents split the steak and the pommes frites were delicious.

The anti pasti menu seemed fun and we would have indulged on other nights. I liked that while the meals were rich, none were too large."}
{"text":"I've been to - and loved - all the Culinary Dropout locations in Phoenix, but I chose to write about this one due to some great service! A small group of friends and I went to Culinary Dropout on Camelback Rd to have a nice meal and celebrate my bachelorette weekend. As always, the food was great. My friends and I split a number of small plates; the salmon, the pretzels and cheese sauce (must try!!), parmesan chips, meat and cheese board, and pork nachos. I also recommend the Room Service cocktail (gin, strawberry simple syrup, prosecco). 

When we got to the restaurant the host staff was very friendly and we were seated immediately, but then it took a little while to get things going. Once they found out that my sister had called ahead and left us a bottle of champagne and prepaid half the dinner, they were much nicer to us and doted on us, but I saw other tables being annoyed by the lack of service they were receiving. I don't remember the name of our server - just that he looked a lot like Jason Mraz! He was very friendly and took whatever ridiculousness my friends and I were saying after a bottle of champagne and 2 cocktails each with a smile and a laugh. He was a great server and I hope some day to return and learn his real name! :)"}
{"text":"We showed up at two different locations, at two different times in Phoenix with out a reservation, and both times there was an hour and a half wait to get a table. So, we called and made reservations  for a third visit, and when we showed up, we were informed that our table wouldn't be available for thirty plus minutes. Why bother taking/making reservations then? I can honestly say that I will pass going here in the future."}
{"text":"Food is completely mediocre.  Nice people.  Service is spot on. But when you tout your food, best be sure it's great.  Oil was old so the chicken came out dark.  Fish and chips the same. Drinks were tasty too. Would have given a two overall but the service, people and drinks saved it.  Drink here.  Eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"The soft pretzels and fondue cheese dip at culinary dropout are perhaps a more iconic and defining part of my annual spring training experience than any actual baseball viewing. Cocktails are varied and interesting. 

Pro tip: hit their happy hour most days of the week for apps and drinks before a night game, or after a day game with a big group."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Management was great and gave us a gift certificate and we enjoyed some great ribs, chicken and pretzels. Kudos to them.

Well, the price fixe NYE menu was apparently too good to be true or even honored on New Years eve 2018. You were supposed to get two apps, two mains and one desert for $48 total, but at 9pm we were told (lied too) that they weren't offering that menu because the dishes sold out or were limited items. Obviously this was untrue as the same four \"sold out\" dishes kept coming out of the kitchen including my fried chicken and also the ribs. The chicken was great and the biscuit, potatoes and cole slaw were slam dunk winners. The huge slab of ribs was tender and fell off the bone - quality stuff. Not looking to take the switcheroo bait, we just ordered main dishes and a drink and we reached the $48 original price. Culinary owes us a desert and some apps as this was just a clear bait and switch."}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant with good food, good service, and nice ambiance.

My group popped into here after a trip to the mall, and we were immediately seated in their outdoor patio. Their menu is quite diverse. Sandwiches, salads, seafood, ribs. A little bit of everything. Although we didn't try them this time around, their pretzel fondue is supposed to be delicious. I had the fish & chips and was very impressed with it. It wasn't soggy or overly greasy, and the fish tasted really fresh. The fries were crispy and the coleslaw, which I gave to my Dad, he said it was some of the best he's had at a restaurant.

The restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived, but our waitress was still very attentive. Food was delivered quickly and hot. The food is on the pricey side, but it IS Scottsdale, where things aren't the cheapest. For our table of three, it was $40-some dollars. Parking can be a bit of a pain, but we lucked out and found a spot in the mall parking lot across the street.

I wish I lived in the area because I want to try the rest of their menu! I'll be sure to stop by if I'm ever in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"The food is great as promised, but my favorite aspect was the happy hour menu and pricing!! We got two drinks and two appetizers (which were enormous) for 28$ in Vegas!!! Unheard of, and delicious! We will certainly return!!"}
{"text":"Overall, the experience was good. The food was tasty and the price was very reasonable. 
Some drawbacks...
It was VERY loud and not a good place to go if you are wanting conversation with the person you're dining with. 
During the summer in Arizona, I think it is important to have a break from the heat. Unfortunately, the evening we ate at Culinary Dropout it was miserable. The restaurant was so hot. Our waiter was sweating and complaining that they had the \"garage bar doors\" open. It was unbearable! 
I will return to the restaurant again- but not until the temperature drops 50 degrees or so. Hard to enjoy your food from a sweaty server and be uncomfortably hot yourself."}
{"text":"Omg everything I ate here was awesome. I stayed at the hard rock for 4 days and I ate here twice a day for four days. The food is decent priced and the atmosphere is beautiful. I loved the crusty bread ."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love a bloody mary in the morning!  Not every morning, mind you, but definitely a lazy weekend morning when I'm enjoying some brunch time with my crew.  I like mine with pretty much any tasty veggie tucked in - pickles, olives, celery, whatever...  So imagine how pleased I was when I ordered Culinary Dropout's bacon-infused Bloody Mary -- FREAKIN' YUMMY!  A little spicy, rich, delicious and fragrant... A BLT in a glass with vodka on top -- and a big ol' slice of bacon stickin' out.  But hold on, I got a little anxious -- let me back up for just a minute...

Culinary Dropout is in the location formerly known as Pink Taco.  I never went to Pink Taco because I'm just not going to eat in such a ridiculously trendy Scottsdale hangout, especially one named after a euphemism for female anatomy, so when I found out that trash hole of a restaurant was gone and this new gastropub opened in its place, I was anxious to check it out.  I have no idea what the decor used to look like there, so I can't compare (which I think is less biased anyway), but I really like the giant tin tiles lining the ceiling/walls, the gigantic glass chandeliers, and the comfortable and homey wood furniture.  The place is comfy casual but totally upscale.

When I arrived at the restaurant the hostess greeted me in a friendly manner, immediately disarming me and making me comfortable.  I was at a table of 10 girls, and our server was just awesome - friendly, funny, and helpful with the menu.  As an accompaniment to the earlier mentioned \"BLT in a glass\" I ordered the shrimp po' boy.  Wow!  Typically po' boys come on toasted baguette like buns that always seem to rip up my mouth.  I usually end up picking the shrimp off with my fork and leaving the brick bread to rot... Not so here!  My shrimp po'boy was on a soft roll, and the shrimp was chopped and mixed with a slightly smokey remoulade, so no shrimps rollin' off my plate! Definitely a big meal, as I couldn't even finish the second half, but my sweet server girl so pleasantly offered to box it up for me so no complaints here!  Not too pricey, as I think for 2 drinks and a sammich it came to about $30 total.

An extra bonus here is the patio, which lines the outside of the restaurant, looking out across Camelback toward Fashion Square mall.  There were both seats and benches (with backs) so the tables looked cozy and pleasant.  And our server said there's live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  May have to hit this place up again in the evening!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to come here for a long time, and finally got the chance to! 

This place has a trendy, loud, modern vibe to it, I wasn't sure if we were going to like it since it was getting hard to hear the other person talk. But the food and our server (Bam-Bam aka Kyle) made up for it. It was Halloween weekend, and all the employees were dressed up in Halloween outfits.. 

It was the Bistro Steak with fries, house salad, Jalisco Flower, Strawberry Martini and cheese fondue made us fall in love with this place. The drinks were extremely strong, the steak very soft, tender, juicy, and fries were plentiful. The cheese fondue was addicting, and the salad was interesting since we've never seen salad served in such a small bowl like that. Kyle was on top of everything, and took great care of us. All for about $85, and a nice tip. For Scottsdale, I was thinking we'd probably get ripped off, but surprisingly, we didn't. We love the place!"}
{"text":"Great spot for food an absolute must if you are in the area. Cant beat the environment either. Highly recommended if you are in town getting over to this."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was maybe best I have ever had in my life. Service was great.  Good vibe. Nice place. Will go back."}
{"text":"I can't believe that Culinary Dropout is rated so low.  Honestly, that sort of lends weight to the commonly-held belief that people in Arizona don't know food.  That is a terrible shame, though, because the Phoenix metropolitan area certainly does have some of the best food I have ever had in the country.  

Whenever possible, I try to give a restaurant a couple shots before giving it a review.  Since I don't live in Scottsdale it hasn't been easy to get back to Culinary Dropout for a second visit, but it was certainly worth the effort yet again.

Everyone raves about the \"Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue\", but it certainly lives up to the hype.  If I lived in Scottsdale, this would be the joint to gather with my friends for happy hour EVERY DAY just to eat these pretzels.

Personally, I have at least tasted the \"Shaved Prime Rib Dip\", \"Pork Belly Cubano\", \"Gorgonzola Chicken Salad\", \"Fried Chicken\", \"Kurobuta Pork Ribs\", \"Bistro Steak\" and \"Caramel Corn\".  Every single one of these dishes is generously portioned, packed with flavor, and unpretentious.  How refreshing to find a place with a menu broad enough to satisfy a large group of friends with varied palates at a really reasonable price.

The drinks are amazing.  Have them all, but start with \"Dirty School Girl\" and \"Smashed Irishman\".

And don't forget the pretzels..."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great environment. If you want to play corn hole or ping pong, sit at the bar, or sit at a table, you can do it all here. Service is good and the food is fantastic.

Don't forget to try the pretzel bites dipped in cheese if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Literally thee best Seared Ahi Tuna Salad I have I had in my life! The service is great, atmosphere is lively, parking is normal Tempe college life, but hey! It's worth it! Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, the perfect blend of stylish and casual, trendy but not pretentious. Some items were overpriced and not too inventive, but their selection of cured meats and cheese is great. They also have a great cocktail list. During the day the outdoor seating is gorgeous. I saw their breakfast menu and it looked like perfect hangover food. Service is friendly and happy to help. The Jambalaya was sub par, but for the overall success of our meal I'd still love to return."}
{"text":"We wanted something new for dinner & I decided on the Culinary Dropout. Made reservations & we were seated promptly. Dress is casual, young crowd, but very noisy! Kyle our waiter was very attentive. We split the ribs. They were very tender, slathered with a yummy barbecue sauce, the fries were thin & crispy.  When Kyle asked how our meal was, I said it was delicious! Then I made a comment about us being the oldest people in the restaurant, he replied, \"but you're young at heart! What a charmer!"}
{"text":"If you want Salmon that will make your nipples hard this is the place for you. Their Salmon dish is OVER THE TOP. I have eaten at several Restaurants in the Hard Rock and this dish was the BEST of them all. Conner was my server and what a great job he did. Pleasant, professional and swift. I was in and out in about 30 minutes including Dessert. You gotta try this this place!!!"}
{"text":"I am so upset at my recent visit to your culinary dropout location here in Vegas!
I had called around 530 to make a reservation because I had heard so many good things about your restaurant and read that you had great unique dishes! So I called and had my friend from out of town make a reservation for a party of 2 at 10 pm. I hadn't seen my friend in a while so I was really enthused to show him this amazing location inside of the Hard Rock. When we got there we were seated by someone that wasn't a host. I didn't get his name but I do remember that he walked us to our table. Before we were sat we made small talk with this gentleman and asked him if it was busy, he said that it was a slow day and then grabbed menus and walked further inside the restaurant. Halfway into the restaurant he asked us if we had preferred to sit outside and seemed very indecisive on where he was going to seat us even though there was plenty of tables with servers in their section to accommodate a measly party of 2. So he instead walked us outside where there were no tables and sat us near a fire pit. Since the outside tables weren't set up he moved a table and two chairs over from a different sections and sat us down. About 5 minutes later a server by the name of candy walked out and introduced herself. I had never been to this location so was interested in the menu, the ingredients and the favorite and best selling dishes. She said \"everything on this menu is surprisingly good\" that didn't sell me on anything so I told her that we would start off with two beers first and we would look over the appetizers. She smiled and walked into the restaurants. My friend and I started catching up and talking and within that time we noticed that she started going to other tables and putting dishes away and closing out people's tabs and completely ditching our table! Twenty minutes had gone by and I didn't get a drink and she didn't come back outside to check on our table. I was infuriated so I walked inside and looked everywhere for a manager! Everywhere I went and everyone I asked didn't seem to know where he was! So I patiently waited by the bar when suddenly candy made her way to me and said I am finally here do you want to be sat at the bar now? What can I get you? I was so mad that she hadn't even apologized or taken the amount of wasted time in to consideration. She had simply dismissed the idea that she had neglected our table and was polishing and putting things away because she wanted to close. Another 5 minutes later the general manager approached the bar and didn't introduce himself and all he said was I'm sorry that she dropped the ball I'll buy you guys drinks. His name was Danny I believe and he also didn't try to asses the situation or make it any better. 5 minutes later he had asked the bartender to give us a round of beers on the house and upon giving me my beer the server spilled the beer all over me and my belongings. So, not only did I waste my time by going to a place I thought was legit and amazing but I was sat outside at a dirty table neglected by a uninterested server and then I got a beer spilled all over me. The manager was the worst experience for me because he did ABSOLUTELY nothing to try to make the situation better. When he was talking to us he was distracted and uninterested in making things right. I am disappointed in the level of service and professionalism that this place offered and I will be telling everyone not to go there! Your company has been known to provide good services, and such events tarnish the company name, so please address this issue soon."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, get the fried chicken. 

Will definitely be back when we have more time to play some games and get some fun drinks"}
{"text":"We had a large group of ten people plus two infants.  We had reservations and were seated immediately upon arrival.  I was impressed with the decor and lighting in the restaurant.  This place looked like a hot spot to be.  I had never been there before, but could tell this would be a fun place for dates and groups of people.  It was a Sunday evening, but still very busy.
Items I would recommend.
-A must is the appetizer pretzels balls with heated cheese.  Wow.  I ate way to much of that and should not have ordered and entree.
-Mystery beer and Mystery Shot for $5.  Kind of fun to not know what beer you are drinking or the kind of shot you are having.
Our waiter was always checking in, great service.  If I went again I would have the mystery beer with mystery shot and pretzel balls with cheese."}
{"text":"We arrived a little after 6pm 45 min wait but while waiting drinks & appetizers available.  My suggestion don't do appetizers because by the time we got to the table we where done. We ordered the couples 3 course meal for $44.  My buddy ordered the salmon bruchetta, meatloaf, salted caramel custard.  I ordered the salad, ribs, salted caramel custard.  By the time I got thru the salad I was done because I had already ordered nachos as an appetizer we both ended up taking our food home.  Culinary Dropout amazing service.

Now this was our 1st time there & it's amazing 3 restaurants in one Phenomenal idea.  Our next visit will be Little Cleos."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend from work on a whim on a Friday afternoon for late work lunch.  Boy am I glad we did.  The place has a great vibe with a younger professional crowd at this time of day.  We sat at the bar had a nice cold beverage and started with their fondue with pretzels.  You get enough in to share with 8-10 people.   They were soft and fresh and cheese was very creamy blend of mild cheese.  For lunch we opted to share two dishes based I. Our servers Rex's- the French dip Wichita came with the best salty au jous you could ask for. We got the side salad cause we had so much for our spritzer. It was a modest sized salad with heirloom tomatoes and s house made ranch tossed perfectly to coat each leaf.  Then we got the house made ravioli with a corn filling- These were on the sweeter side like most creamed corn dishes.  Had a smiley undertone that I was not expecting but was very happy about to balance out the flavor.  Ithe pasta was perfectly made and very beautiful to look at.  A nice environment that seems like it can be a great place to hang out all day eat drink and have a great time with friends. Their outdoor area has games and there is free valet, no atm so bring a few bucks to dip the guys in the heat all day.   It's a large space but they do a great job at making you feel cozy despite the concrete floors.   Great job will be back again their menu had a little bit of good for most everyone, not sure if there were vegan choices."}
{"text":"It started out good, but sadly the main course failed to deliver.
We came to Culinary Dropout after a super long day driving to and from the Grand Canyon and we wanted food that was convenient. It's literally an elevator ride away from our room on the upper floor of the Hardrock Hotel. 

Loved the super spacious layout of the interior. Great for groups and it opens out into a patio area near the pool. Great for the lovely summer weather. We came on a Thursdays night around 10pm (they close at 11pm) and the restaurant was fairly empty. Service was attentive and they happily made recommendations. We ordered:

*Pretzels and provolone fondue: Good! I was a little hesitant at first but the whole combination was delicious. Also, the pretzels weren't overly salted but buttery, which was great. Fondue was a great consistency too. 
*Pork belly toast: Good but the open face baguette the pork belly was on was a little soggy. The flavors were fresh and reminded me of a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich. The pork belly was flavored so well, and was cooked so that it was crisp. 
*27 hour pork ribs: Lackluster, except for the fries. The pork ribs were cooked decently, but the molasses sauce was a little too tangy. The coleslaw was really bad. It didn't taste like anything at all. I rather have a side salad raw. The cool thing was that they split it for us because they knew we were sharing. 
*Bourbon black bottom pie: Great! Chocolate ganache and graham cracker crust. Soooo good. The bourbon flavor was actually pretty strong. We got it for free was a birthday treat. Yay! 

SIDE NOTE: Culinary Dropout allows their servers to wear anything that they want, this include jewelry and facial piercings. While our server was talking to us, his lip ring fell onto the floor and we never found it. While it wasn't a big deal to us (although I found it hilarious), I'd imagine a worse situation in which it could have fell into a drink or food. Sooo...just keep this in mind. =P"}
{"text":"Great food. I took my husband there for his 30th birthday with 15 of his friends. When the waitress came around to take drink orders she noticed I was 8 months pregnant and skipped my order...as if l didn't exist. I had to track her down to order a water for myself. 
Extremely unprofessional service if you ask me. Also, the restaurant wasn't busy but they brought us our checks right after our food came to the table. We felt pressured to leave. We would have stayed and drank for a wh"}
{"text":"\"Dropout's\" recent beer-pairing event (March) was a great surprise from start to finish.

The ambiance of the large outdoor dining area was, as expected, a pleasant visual treat aided by a setting sun and surrounding mood lighting.

Two tables had been set aside for this pairing event and shortly after the scheduled time the Culinary Dropout (cool name) crew got on with the good stuff - a five part/course pairing of food and brew.

Tony (AGM) and Ben proceeded to describe each upcoming brew and dish with fine detail.

So what's behind my 5-star rating?

Several off-property chefs participated in the tasting. Two of them did not favor one of the brews offered but respected all dishes in the pairing.

Although not a proclaimed \"foodie\" myself, it is noteworthy to report that each pairing was appreciated by all served. One woman and a visiting chef (noted above) found the Apricot Hefeweizen not to their liking while my opinion was that of great balanced and a welcome pairing choice.

Not a favorite, but the Starter (Antipasti paired with the Apricot Hefe) was a good effort and primer for the main dishes. 

Poussin paired with Scottish Ale (2nd course) did the trick and was followed up by Double Bock Braised Short Ribs paired with a Devastator Double Bock - wonderful!

The S'Mores Tart was stellar. Eager to dig in I snapped a picture after already enjoying two bites. The Outer Darkness Imperial Stout made for a wise pairing for this tart.

Despite almost all pairing seats being occupied, service was top-notch. Timing between pairings was relaxed and each dish/brew was served as if you were a VIP.


Congrats to Tony, Ben and Chef Mike - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great! It was hearty... drink were pretty good, but hostess was not a good reflection of what this place offers. She was put out to answer questions and unaccommodating regarding seating preference."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for The Nine Inch Nails concert, ended up staying at the Hard Rock so I had to try this restaurant. 
You simply have to try the Sweet Corn Ravioli... it was simply delicious!
For dessert I tried the Monkey Bread and that is another must try. I do recommend it with NO SUGAR GLAZE though, I mean that is really subjective but I hate sugar coating and I think that brings out the apple flavor more."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! Especially the pork nachos. Service is usually pretty great too. Their drinks are ridiculously expensive though. A martini like drink is served in a small champagne glass used for toasts at weddings. We'll go back and order cans of beer though."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here recently.  Atmosphere was great.  Service was outstanding and food was delicious

I'd recommend for anyone looking for a casual dinner with great food

Only drawback was kids barred from table tennis after 6"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Good beer choices and incredable food. I was never a fish and chips person 'till I got them here. Yes, they sometimes get packed but I'll deal with it to get their awesome food."}
{"text":"The Tempe location is my favorite, food is consistently good and the service is just as good.  The pretzel and provolone fondue is a MUST have, I like the selection of meats and cheeses, the fried chicken and the wings are fantastic.  So many drinks to choose from, I had the classic mule and another one with bourbon and cabernet, yes BOTH and it was delish!"}
{"text":"Just fun all round. Took my grandma here and the entire hipster staff treated her like a queen. Fun atmosphere (bags, fire pits, stage) and equally solid food. Pretzels, deviled eggs, brussel sprouts, beet salad, burger all executed on point. Always a good excuse to dine here."}
{"text":"Really, really good food. Some similar items to Arrogant Butcher (both Fox Restaurants)...
Once again, I had the pretzel fondue which consists of this yummy hot cheese in a little pot, accompanied by these absolutely to-die-for \"pretzels\" . These pretzels are NOT the box variety, but little baby loaves of pretzel bread, which I have now started day-dreaming about...
In addition, I had the turkey pastrami sandwich (also on a pretzel bun) and it was perfectly wonderful. 
My husband had the ribeye, which was sliced and had a delish blue cheesey sauce on the bottom. He loved it (I snagged a bite, it was mightly good!). 
This is was weekend night, and the place was packed with beautiful young people all decked out (well,except for us, that is). The music was a little bit loud (like bar loud) for me, but the food will be calling me back...not to mention that fabulous pretzel bread..."}
{"text":"I discovered this place at a friends birthday dinner .  The food quality was just brilliant.  From the simple like pretzel and cheese fondue to the more complex flank steak, the place succeeded in matters of taste and presentation.  The decor is impressive and fun.  The wait staff left a bit to be desired, but we were in a large group so it is understandable.  Lastly, the bar (while appearing to be a full bar) had a very limited selection in alcohols.  A really cool place though."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and frequent here often.  Everything I have ate there has been good even though now most of the time I just fill up on the pretzels!  Happy hour is a lot of fun here and the staff isn't too bad to look at either.  I do agree that this is more of a drinks/appetizers kind fo place rather than a common dinner spot.  Really good drinks,  great atmosphere, and really friendly staff."}
{"text":"I typically don't do this but honestly I was extremely disappointed with my service. We didn't have a reservation on a weekend (we figured it would be a wait, no big deal) they told us there was a long wait for a table but the bar was open seating, they didn't even ask if we wanted to get on a list for a table which for me I thought was common courtesy. Moving on, we eventually found open seats at the bar and decided to eat there. From there it was all down hill. It was like pulling teeth to get anyone to even look at us, let alone hand us a menu to look over. We ordered an appetizer we knew they had as we were starving but beyond that felt like an inconvenience to the entire staff. I already had a drink the I got before we found seats but ordering a water was taking it too far apparently as the bartender rolled her eyes while she poured them. No one gave us plates, napkins, silverware for our shared food. Every time we would try to catch someone's attention it felt like every person behind the bar was actively trying to ignore us. I've been in the service industry and feel that I am a very understanding customer but this was flat out bad service. I shouldn't need to feel like an inconvenience when all I'm asking you to do is the job you signed up to do."}
{"text":"The menu is a bit small, but the food is fantastic. Our leftovers were not enough for another meal, but we couldn't just let it go to waste. It was so delicious.
 Also a big shout out to James! Wonderful server."}
{"text":"5 stars for service. Quick, attentive and checked in just enough to be observant but not intruding. 
The brussel sprouts were not the same that I remember and love from the Austin store. The seared ahi salad was maybe a 3.75/5.  I liked the wasabi peas in them for the added spice and crunch. The tuna was just OK, didn't have much flavor and kind of got lost in the salad.
I would definitely go back and try something else, they've got a great vibe, I just had a better taste experience at the Austin location."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night. Mistake #1. We waited almost 2 hours and then the girl said she paged us when she clearly did not and we had to wait longer. Finally it was determined that our pager was not working...really annoying. They didn't even bother to apologize. 

As for the food - wow! The pretzels were amazing! The beer was good too. I would definitely go again - just on a different night. The servers in the restaurant was nice enough. Parking is ample and they have live music on Saturday nights. It seemed more like a bar type of atmosphere based on the amount of flirting/pick up lines going on.

All in all this place would receive 4 stars if the service wasn't so terrible up front. The food is really good, but there is no reason to be snobby about it!"}
{"text":"I came here last week for my birthday dinner was had a wonderful time! The ambiance was so cute and charming! My boyfriend and I started off with the \"paper bag special\", a surprise beer that comes out in a paper bag :). I ordered the mussels and they were DELICIOUS. They came with some sausage as well as two bread sticks. It was a large portion for a good price and I was stuffed for the rest of the night! My boyfriend ordered the pastrami on a pretzel roll which I would also recommend Our bill came out to about thirty dollars, what a steal! I would come here again and again!"}
{"text":"SOOOOOOOOO disappointed with the Culinary Dropout.  I came here not once but twice in the same weekend.  

The first was for beers (a good selection) and enjoyed the artichoke (if a bit watery) and the soft pretzels bites with (really thin) provolone fondue. 

The second time was for bunch on a Sunday.  Service was super slow and forgetful. The worst part was the biscuits and sausage gravy.  It was tomato-y.  TOMATO.  I just... *shivers* I don't want to talk about it.  It was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Cool place to have lunch!  I love the atmosphere and the outstanding service!  The pretzels w/ beer cheese is die for!  

From the meatloaf to salads to fish n' chips.  Everybody left happy and full.

I will definitely go back when I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Rebekah and the management staff were outstanding. They were able to accommodate a large party and cater to our needs. After a reservation hiccup they went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. The food was amazing and we will be sure to visit again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Took my wife to the Culinary Dropout (CD) for our date night.  We had heard a lot about this place since it took over the spot where the Pink Taco (Mexican food yeah right) use to be.  We started out with Provolone Fondue and pretzel bread.  We also ordered some of their hard to find premium meat (Jamon Iberico).  The fondue was very mild in taste which was good but nothing that would stand out.  I did wrap the pretzel bread with the Iberico which was a good combo.

For a main course I had the ribs and my wife had the shrimp po boy.  The ribs were good but were not smoked, and they are also boiled before they are cooked.  If you like ribs that are not traditionally prepared (smoked/bbq) then you should like these because they do have great pork flavor.  The po boy was also good.  It had great flavor overall but you could not taste the shrimp in it.  The other flavors in the sandwich were just to overpowering.  I think if CD marinated the shrimp and grilled them instead of frying them it would have held up better to the other flavors.

Service was good but not exceptional.

Overall CD is a good restaurant but not special in a sea of trendy bar/restaurants.  It is the typical Fox project that has good food but nothing that would be classified as unforgettable.  Would I go back if a friend had not tried the place yet, yes but I would not go back for a second time with my wife nor would it be a place I would suggest to people as a can't miss."}
{"text":"There is some stiff competition for the best Sunday brunch in north central Phoenix and culinary dropout is miles from even having a foot in the race.  With an underwhelming selection of brunch items that are average at best take your brunch appetite elsewhere.  The only reason to pick this place is if you are more into the alcohol/beer selection and fun atmosphere than quality of food you are getting.  

I tasted a couple meals today ( I ordered the eggs breakfast and tasted a friends frittata).  The eggs breakfast was pretty standard -eggs cooked about right (ordered them medium well and got them more over easy), I subbed sausage for bacon (sausage was not great and I got about one piece if that - see pic) and the potatoes came out of a bag and were awful.  They really need to change the potatoes to homemade hash browns. Who doesn't have wheat toast nowadays?! 

The frittata was not any better.  Looks like someone just poured a cup of egg whites in a pan and threw some veggies in it.  It was lacking both creativity and taste."}
{"text":"Located in hard rock casino and it has the perfect casual atmosphere.  They have a patio outside facing the rehab pool.  
We started with the pretzel bites and cheese which were amazing!!! The drinks were really good as well.  They had this jalapeño based drink that was to die for!  Everything else we had was pretty good as well. My only complaint and reason for 4 stars is not having more items on the menu.  The menu is limited. Prices are okay for a casino.  I'll be going back just for the pretzels alone. Pretty much the best pretzels I've ever had!"}
{"text":"All I can say is this place was AWESOME!!!  Found it on open table as a great place for brunch and they surpass my expectations.  I wish I could give them a 10 because everything was hands down amazing from the food to their service to the ambience.  

I came with a group of friends for a bday brunch.  We ordered a bunch of food unfortunately I was on the hungry side so I wasn't able to get any pics.  I ordered the garden kale salad and Avocado toast, I was hungry and needed to fuel up on some nutrients.  Out table also ordered the pretzels which smelled amazing, wasn't in the mood for too much bread so I passed on them.  The food was so yummy and the coffee omg so good! I asked with sever if it was Abel's to be purchased.  The company originated out of Arizona and the beans are locally brewed there.  The server was kind enough to give me information on how to order it online.  

Speaking of service, outstanding.  They were so accommodating to our dietary request, even suggesting options to sub for our vegetarian friend.  She also suggested places to check out that are local hangout spots while we were in town.  

The place was very clean and had a cool outdoor area.  Since we are staying in the dessert they are not used to the heat so much, so there are heat lamps everywhere to warm you while dinning outside during their \"winter\".  I would definitely return to this place if I am in the area again.  Not located to far of the strip in the hard rock hotel."}
{"text":"We are here every year for Spring Training and we stay down the street, by far the best bartender is , BLAKE he is amazing. My boyfriend and I are bartender from Northern California and a he hands down has made the most amazing drinks I've ever had! Dirty martini shaken with an olive??? Wow. Man I've learned so many new techniques. You my friend are here to stay. Service and drinks top notch! Come here! You'll be missing out if you don't!"}
{"text":"it's hip, it's fun. great vibe and decor. the staff is friendly and no wait with full bar !"}
{"text":"I love Culinary Dropout.  As someone else mentioned...you have to think of it more as a bar than a true sit down restaurant.  It's a pub, that has been \"Fox-ified.\"  I love coming here with friends just to drink and have some light food, before a night out.

Their cocktails are all really unique and really tasty.  My two favorites are the Bacon Bloody Mary and the Sauerkraut.  The BBM is self explanatory....bacon infused vodka is used, and even served with a piece of bacon instead of the typical celery.  I'm not normally a huge bloody mary fan, but if I'm here during the daytime I always order it.  The Sauerkraut martini is amazing....gin, elderflower, orange marmalade, and dijon mustard.  With the mustard in it, it is a very savory cocktail...which I love.  Goes perfect with the soft pretzels & fondue, which is my favorite app to get.  As far as entree's, the short rib pasta is my favorite, simple and delicious.  Everything I've tried here is really tasty...but again, think of it as classy/modern/unique/upscale bar food, not gourmet restaurant food."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour. It was practically empty - just a couple of other folks sitting at the bar. The space itself is nice - big and open. The bartender was really nice and friendly. The happy hour deals are great. $3 for draft beer. And an assortment of half-off menu items - chips and dip, fries, grilled cheese sliders, etc. I went with the chips and onion dip. The portion was plentiful. The chips were large and just the right level of thickness and crispness. The dip was creamy and tasty and not overly onion-y. Based on my limited experience here, I would most definitely return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and loved the steak meet dishes. We had 5 folks and everything was great. The drinks, try the El Matador, the steak dishes, try the Korean Steak and then the desserts, try the Monkey Bread. Banana pie was way too salty but overall a great meal."}
{"text":"My only complaint is that it's very loud, but then again what do you expect in Vegas.  The live music was great.  The food and drinks were very good, and we enjoyed our time.  Had the meatloaf and it was delicious."}
{"text":"We love the Yard in Tempe! We have been here several times and it's been a pleasant experience each time. We have tried nearly everything! The ribs are wonderful and the fried chicken is worth the wait. You can't go wrong with the steak too. My brother had a burger last time and it was one of the best I've ever tasted! Pretzel is one of our favorites for a app! I would suggest making a reservation if you go on the weekend, it's a big place but they fill up quickly!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, great food, great atmosphere. As an Interior Designer, I was surprisingly pleased by the decor, furniture and vibe. Everything about it was comfortable and inviting. Food was great. They need to train their bartender on drinks. Ordered a Sex on the Beach and got Vodka with Soda Water. Another bartender tasted it and replaced it with a way better version. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I come to culinary a lot and normally sit at the bar but today we sat in the lounge. Jasmine was our server and she was so nice and attentive. It's rare that you get a server who knows the perfect amount to check in on you. She did not check in so much it was abnoying but was still around when we needed her. Thanks jasmine!"}
{"text":"Awesome outdoor seating area, interesting and delicious menu, entertaining and friendly staff, and yummy cocktails! No complaints here!"}
{"text":"I have heard wonderful things about Culinary Dropout, so my husband and I were super excited to try it with some friends.  I ordered the fried chicken - now, I have to say, I am a Kentucky girl.  I know my fried chicken.  I haven't had awesome fried chicken since I moved out of Kentucky almost a year ago.  Culinary Dropout has ahhhhhmazing fried chicken.  The prices are a bit high, but the food is delicious.  My meal came with three pieces of chicken (a leg, breast & thigh), coleslaw, mashed potatoes & a honey biscuit - for $22.  

The restaurant, itself is beautifully decorated.  There is an open patio section with cool fire pit tables.  (My description is terrible - go see for yourself!).  I'm a professional photographer & would looove to shoot inside this place.  It's so cool.  The staff was very nice and our waitress held herself together well when some douche grabbed her butt while she was taking his order.  For me, the music was a bit loud.  We could barely hear our friends talking, so it's not great for conversation.  & the only other downside is that it's in the Hard Rock, which is quite possibly the douchiest place in Las Vegas.  We dodged about 10 Bachelor parties and a gaggle of obnoxious drunk girls (at 5:30 in the afternoon - I know this is Vegas, but geez...at least wait until after dark to be so drunk you can't walk.) just getting to the actual restaurant.

Go.  Eat.  Dodge drunk guys.  Be happy."}
{"text":"After an extremely rough day of our culinary tour/pub crawl, we need a place to sit, collect our thoughts, and continue eating and drinking.  While I was trolling yelp for a place to go, this popped up.  Several of the items on the menu are the same as The Arrogant Butcher so I put on my detective shoes (translation: used the internet on my phone) to discover that yes indeed, this is a Fox restaurant.  

Oddly enough, the two items mentioned are the only duplicates from Arrogant Butcher.  The menu is casual gastropub fare and the drink list is fantastic.  Our waiter was attentive and kept us mired in food and drink.  The pretzel bites are a must order (here or at Arrogant Butcher).  We also ordered a meat and cheese plate - yum!  Drinks were inventive and tasty.  Dessert was delicious as well although I was a tiny bit disappointed in the apple monkey bread.  It was good but lacking a little something-something.  

The outside patio is lovely.  I recommend going on a Saturday afternoon when it's not terribly crowded.  

Bueno!"}
{"text":"Right in the heart of Scottsdale's fine dining and shopping area. Great service. Outdoor seating (that's covered). We showed up right at lunch time and were able to be seated immediately. The crowd wasn't there yet. 

They have an antipasta appetizer menu that includes choices of different thinly sliced meats and cheeses. We had prosciutto and two types of cheeses that were phenomenal. Followed that up with a kale and sweet corn (minus the corn) salad for me and a crispy shrimp salad for my colleague. My salad was extremely good and that they were able to modify it made me very happy. 

The service was excellent and the pricing was really decent as well."}
{"text":"Good food.  Not one of my favorite fox restaurants-wouldn't go out of my way to go here.  But, the service has always been good and the ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"Breakfast Sat AM: overall okay. Food was quickly served, which was good since there weren't many people around. Service was attentive, also a good thing considering how slow it was (sometimes servers slack off when it's slow). 
It was pretty empty so got the pick of seats, asked for shade outside, but the hostess tried to sit us in 1/2 sun. She was nice enough after asking again to move us to full shade. 
Egg white fritatta was good! It was served with Kale but that was kind of tough; doesn't look like they massaged it well enough to soften it up. 
Family had eggs & bacon, and biscuits & gravy. Expect french-style bread- quite crusty so unless your mouth is used to it, it can hurt your upper palate. However, it was toasted on the grill and buttered nicely. 
Biscuits & Gravy was good, but oddly had American cheese on it. I was put off, but my brother liked it. 
Irish coffee wasn't really. Not sure if this was the SAT AM bartender, or not. It was just Jameson and coffee, no cream, no sugar."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout would make it to my list of top 5 restaurants. The atmosphere is very fun in the outside seating. They have corn hole and ping pong tables to play with your party before or after your meal. As well as live music- which is both a pro and a con for me. Pro: he sings acoustic covers and is actually good at it. Con: the music is always way too loud. 

Recommend: pretzels and fondue, bbq pork belly nachos, fried chicken. 

Tip: it's been a year since I've gone, but if it still holds true- happy hour all day long for Sunday football."}

{"text":"Best place in tempe! Awesome atmosphere and the food is delicious! I honestly can't choose a favorite because everything I have tried is amazing. I definitely recommend trying the pretzels, turkey pastrami and the sweet corn cannellonni... I promise you will not regret it! The service is always awesome as well! Not too in your face but very attentive!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance that's trendy and casual. It is family friendly before dark but even then it can be iffy depending on the crowd. It is a college hangout with ASU a stones throw away so you have a mix crowd but mostly with college kids. They have a nice outdoor area with couches and pool and bags. The food was good, service could be better and the prices vary depending on what you're there for but I guess average.   While it is cool, I felt very old and out of place even being in my early 30s with my family."}
{"text":"Too loud under the aluminum roof. Food variety is good and I like the mussels appetizer. I've been to similar places downtown Tempe with a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place last Friday. I loved the atmosphere and the patio area. All the employees were very nice and I did enjoy being there. The reason I give only two stars is, the food is EXTREMELY over priced. I had the trout, which was very good, but came with just the fillet and some green beans. That's it. And it was $19. This is way over priced. And the other reason is the bathrooms. I really HATED the fact that, while I was trying to use the sinks, there were woman walking around behind me. I am not a prude by any stretch, but I was not comfortable with this AT ALL. They should change that. I will not be coming back because of this."}
{"text":"I love the Hard Rock as a property, and want to love all the food options as well, but wouldn't make the effort to return here. Funniest item was a honey almond micro brew from WI which came in a can so large that it was impossible to finish-good thing for beer I guess! Prices were firm for the portion sizes which were not generous-and the Seared Tuna Salad which I ordered was reasonably tasty-but the presentation was lackluster at best=looking like a bowl of lettuce with a few shreds of this or that thrown in and a few chopped up pieces of grey looking tuna which were certainly hard to distinguish from a lettuce leaf-hardly the normal presentation of fresh slices of seared rare tuna one would expect as the featured item in your bowl. Service was mediocre=no refills on ice tea and long lapses with barely a suggestion of dessert on a not full Monday night. Seems like an adequate option if you want drinks and bar food in an interesting vibe-but don't come hungry and expect to fill up unless you order plenty and if eating healthy is the idea-would pass also. Most of the rave food options are fried and heavy on fat loaded dips-maybe the right idea to ward off a hang over.."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, great live music. Food was also good. Excellent selection of beers and craft cocktails. Wait staff were outstanding. In town for son's ASU grad school graduation and entire party couldn't have been more pleased. Waiter Zach did superior job."}
{"text":"If found this place from a google search, and I absolutely LOVED the experience!  It has a really cool vibe, with a pseudo Mid Century Modern decor, a lively (mainly) 20-30 something clientele.  I was sorry to discover that they were out of the Korean style prime rib (I arrived after 8pm), so I ordred the Bistro Steak and it was FANTASTIC!  I will definitely try to fit this place in my schedule when I visit Phoenix next."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place has bad reviews. The food and drinks are amazing! I'd def get the pretzel cheese fondue. The fried chicken and ramen were also delicious. The cocktails are yummy and strong. They even do live music on Fridays which was great! Also best service we've had in Scottsdale yet."}
{"text":"I'm in town bartending for the super bowl and staying in tempe. I am from San Diego and pride myself on great food, solid cocktails, and a rad ambiance. This place is on point. The staff def gets a 5*****. My fav is the raddest Manhattan from my boy Jake killin it in the service well. Brian is full of rad hospitality and helpful recommendations. Ivan's service skills are on point as well as his cocktails and his jean vest. This place is def as rad as all the beards I see. Well played boys. And a mighty thanks. Def recommended!!  Cheers and hangloose baby."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a group of friends, great place for a large group. We ordered all the top recommend items pretzels, fried chicken, and the salted Carmel dessert. Everything was awesome! The only reason I didn't give this place five stars is because the temp. Inside had to be 85' it was so damn hot!!! We actually left early because it was so hot inside. I was there a month ago and it was hot inside also. Dress cool!"}
{"text":"Cuinary Dropout is alice and wonderland, a purple room Beyonce would have in her house, and Elton John. Mix that in a blender.

The menu has some gastro pub favorites,  unique takes on classic dishes and then burgers, fries, appetizers, desserts, wines, beers, well drinks, fluffy purple things.. 

I would recommend 

drinks-
room service
moscow mule 

food- 
meat/cheese. sopresatta, manchengo, marcona 
the butternut squash raviolis or corn cannelloni fun 
the M.A.C. Burger   (wayyyyy better than McD's makes- yes there is a middle bun present)

Many more dishes to try with their seasonal menu. Will definitely be back, especially for happy hours and after going to Fashion Square.   Walking around the Scottsdale waterfront afterwards is definitely worth checking out.  *~*~*"}
{"text":"Very cool place, had the antipasto which was awesome , lots of fresh deli meats and asparagus and special breadsticks , excellent, the salmon was great Andy friend had the fish and chips, and another had the chopped Italian salad, all great!"}
{"text":"I actually ate here 3 times in 5 days. Yes, it was close by & convenient, but also, great service, & super delicious. 
The first night, we came starving for dinner. We tried the pretzel bites with provolone cheese dip, the fried chicken and biscuit, and the kale salad. All of which were seriously outstanding. The fried chicken was worth every calorie. The salad made me forget i was eating a salad. The pretzel bites were great, but the order is HUGE. Plenty to share between 5 or 6 people. (I overate)
The second time, I went alone for breakfast, & got treated so well, I almost felt like one of the employees. Their coffee is wonderful, & the classic egg breakfast was just perfect. 
The third time, we went there for lunch and I tried the egg white frittata, & also revisited the kale salad. Once again, Everything was top notch."}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious food. Cool atmosphere. Heard a lot of great things about this place and it delivered on every spot. Very similar to Arrogant Butcher, especially when it comes to the delicious pretzel bun on the turkey pastrami, but those are not comparrisons to shy away from. The deviled eggs with prosciutto tasted fresh and the M.A.C. burger was simple, yet savory."}
{"text":"Great service and great, affordable food in Vegas! Our waiter was hilarious and kept us laughing as he attended to us. The only downside is that our entrees took a while to come out, but once we got them they were oh so tasty."}
{"text":"Big open area great for large get togetherness. The bathroom doors are 90% see through which is very uncomfortable. Beer selection is good. I recommend  the brown bag special . Food is ok nothing spectacular or must try. I did have Asian tuna salad and there was barely any tuna in it. The cashews and sesame seeds were a nice touch of crunch and umami."}
{"text":"Having only lived in Scottsdale for two weeks, I found my self here twice! 

The staff is casual, knowledgable, friendly and efficient.  

The decor is fantastic: texture, color, light and ambiance is a true bonus to the food. It's very laid-back \"rocker\" but inviting to all.

Though I would skip the \"fried chicken\" - - the flavor is nothing to write home about (the chicken fingers were better, leaner and non-greasy compared to the fried chicken entree but it might be the house made sauce that may have saved them). The name of the place makes me think that the Chef should up the anty on flavor.and the biscuits are def better at KFC - - Even the $5 cheap salad is just Ok.  What I do highly recommend the pretzel ball and provolone cheese fondue!  Yes, yes, yes.  

Their happy hour is a noteworthy event: in the summer they have $4 wine coolers that are addictive (wine, dash of liquor, soda and fruit) and a select menu of half off goodies. Plus a decent beer selection.

All in all, everyone SHOULD give this place a try at least once."}
{"text":"Place is huge and love all the bar games but also has a fresh look to it! And the food is good!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying every item of food that we ordered was AMAZING. The pretzels with the provolone fondue, the steak and potatoes, and the fried chicken. Our waiter was courteous and helped us with our dinner decisions without being pushy. 

The only reason I'm  giving it 4 stars is because of the mismatch of customers and ambience. The menu is pricier and the restaurant is beautiful- with hanging chandeliers and cute lounge chairs for seating- but the people in there aren't very dressed up, most wearing workout clothes. My boyfriend and I dressed up because we had been to a different location and it was much fancier so it was disappointing to feel \"overdressed\" at such a beautiful place. 

Overall I would come here again and recommend it to friends!"}
{"text":"I can't say good enough things about this place. The food and atmosphere is great. Matt, the bartender is AMAZING! So friendly and such good energy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was recommended to me by the concierge at the hotel I was staying at. I was by myself and sat at the bar. Definitely a lively place but the bartender was attentive. He made me several excellent cocktails. 

The food was decent, although my mussels were a bit undercooked....definitely not good for shellfish. I had the kale salad as an entree and they added salmon to it for some protein. All in all tasty, but not outstanding."}
{"text":"For my first time here, I was pleasantly surprised! It wasn't very busy, we went on a Tuesday night around 8:30. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is fantastic! We love coming here for a night out with friends or just drinks and appetizers. Would give this place 5 stars for sure :)"}
{"text":"The place is lively and it looks good. The menu is fine and the quality of food is good. I've been in a few times now and can't get over the service standards. The staff is friendly but on 3 of 5 visits...the food hits the table before the drinks. The 9 dollar beer needs a glass...no, not a tumbler. Something in his brand (SFC) of restaurants is missing something....I can't put my finger on it, but they all have that \"missing something\" feeling about 'em. This one is no exception. 
But hey, he's doing something right because you see his concepts everywhere..."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant, awesome menu design, good atmosphere, and pretty good food. Service....RUDE! Snotty pretentious female server yelled at one of the guys at our table because she couldn't understand what he was saying. Bad day or not, your job is customer service. Other than her, try the fried chicken and the pretzel bites with the cheese fondue. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is so fun! It's in a great location. Wonderful service. Delicious food. Quick delivery of apps and entrees and even speedier delivery of drinks. It's a great place for a classy happy hour. 

The kale salad and pretzel bites are definite must try's."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great hip vibe. If you are a 20s something you'll love the vibe here. Very cool. Even for a middle aged dude, I love it. 

Seating is inside and outside.  We sat outside by a fire pit which was nice. They also have an area for games like cornhole, ping pong, etc.  However you must be 21 to enter!

Food is always good here with unique twists on traditional dishes. Another great chef here.  The Dropout in Scottsdale is great too."}
{"text":"Recently dined while attending a show at the Hard Rock Resort on a Sat night. The restaurant had a nice energy and vibe and what was really cool is there is an outdoor area that's near the pool. Being that it was Feb - the weather was slightly cool but they had heat lamps to make it comfortable. The outdoor area is quite expansive and features 'cornhole' games and it was a nice respite from the noise inside. Ordered the pretzel bites with fondue to start the evening. As other reviewers have mentioned this can maybe be shared by 4 people. Nice warm almost small cup cake sized sea salt pretzel 'bites' and a small cauldron of provolone cheese fondue that was heated by a small tea light candle - YUM! My guest had the Turkey Pastrami sandwich with a side salad and I had the fish & chips. The sandwich was good portion sized and the fish was not overly breaded and nice and crisp with sides of ketchup and tartar sauce. The fries were average but served nice and hot. Everything was served promptly - there some nice cocktail options as well. The table next to us had the Italian 'grinder' sandwich and the shaved Prime Rib Dip sandwich with au jus. They said they were really good. The food and atmosphere is reminiscent of what I would say more of a pub type feel. A fun place to gather with friends for before or after a show or to watch a sporting game on the many tvs throughout both inside and outside. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Phoenix!
The pretzel fondue appetizer is always a hit, and I loved the kale and sweet potato salad. Culinary dropout knows how to do healthy-tasty right! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food was not great, waitresses did not dress professionally, and they got my child's allergy order wrong and it had to be sent back.  The place is also very noisy so was very hard to hear each other talk.  Also either the chairs were too short or the table tops were too high so it was an awkward seating.  The parking was convenient though."}
{"text":"One of the managers... with a super sweet beard lol refused to change one of the TVs ( to US men's ice hockey) in the corner making up some excuse that there have been people all day watching the figure skating... I turned around and NO ONE was watching it of course but instead of admitting it, he insulted me and called me 'salty' haha pretty immature but if that's how you treat a group of 5 you don't deserve our service... had a great meal at the Lodge and the service was great!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Culinary Dropout enough times that I've probably tried half the items on the menu. It's a great place to enjoy a \"hip\" evening on the town. The outdoor seating is especially nice and they have heat lamps for when it gets a little cold out. The pretzel fondue appetizer was a crowd pleaser. The meatloaf, butternut squash cannelloni, and chicken curry are standouts on the entree menu. The best aspect of this place, though, is the amazing service. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Overrated! The food was cold when it came out and the service was decent at best. After we couldnt eat our food the manager paid for our whole meal which was amazing. I will try it again"}
{"text":"This is a fun, funky place with a great atmosphere! I love going with a group of friends but two people can be fun too! You can sit inside or out on the patio, which I recommend unless it is too hot or cold out. (Duh) I love turning people on to this lovely unpretentious gem in the city.
The food is top notch! The pretzel knots with provolone fondue is great, as are the house made chips and onion dip. Oh and the meatloaf is off the hook never eaten such a tasty one. Chocolate bourbon cake is divine! The Moscow mule has a big kick! I recommend going during happy hour try the different appetizers on the cheap!"}
{"text":"Both locations (Camelback and Tempe) are fantastic! If you are looking for a relaxed, chill atmosphere where you can sit back and enjoy great food and great service, I highly recommend either location. This is now one of my favorite places to visit. Love it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely best! We tried several items on the menu and everything was outstanding and the atmosphere was perfect for a laid back afternoon."}
{"text":"I took my son to a going away lunch celebration to Culinary Dropout.  The service was great, the atmosphere was fun and the food was fabulous.  Couldn't have been a better experience.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It is my second time at this restaurant it is fabulous. From the service, the ambience and the food. Everything is excellent. The cocktails are great as well. One of my favorites in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Although our experience did not start out well, as we were leaving (due to the poor service) we encountered the manager Kyle. 

He could not have been nicer and more gracious. He convinced us to return to the restaurant to give them another chance.

Calvin was our server. He was terrific! He was knowledgeable, attentive and kind. 

We ordered the house potato chips that came with an onion dip...yummy!

I ordered the kale and sweet corn salad and my husband ordered the meatloaf. Both meals were fantastic and more than we could eat!

Both the manager Kyle and the server Calvin came over several times to check on us.

Kyle not only saved the evening and our opinion of the restaurant, but his actions and kindness convinced me to use the facility for an upcoming event.

Kyle is a true manager. He took control of a bad situation and completely changed the outcome. I admire his abilities."}
{"text":"The server was awesome! This was our first time and he recommended some great choices. For drinks we loved the devious behavior! We had the pretzels with fondue. We couldn't put them down! But we had too because there was so many. For our entree we split the fried chicken and did the up charge for two breast instead of dark meat. I loved that they even did that. When they brought out our plates they plated it separately which was awesome. Thank goodness we split it because it was the perfect portion split. It's a huge entree for One. Loved this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped on a Sunday evening and the  place was almost packed.  We didn't want to sit inside due to the wait and to the noise level.
We sat outside at the bar which was fine.
We ordered drinks which were very good and ordered some food.
First we ordered off the antipasto menu, goat cheese and grilled asparagus.  Then we ordered the gorgonzola chicken salad which was outstanding.
The only negative was that the service was very average and could have been friendlier."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Thank you @jakeslane for joining me on our own V day. Ken's service was incredible! Food was amazing!!!! @hardrockhotellv #hardrockpartyrock 
100% Man food, Lady food, everyone food! 
This place is the bomb."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with coworkers and ordered turkey pastrami on pretzel roll. Pretty tasty."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE experience, rude bar tenders, inattentive service, messed up my check, not ever coming back.  TWICE we had to call manager."}
{"text":"Food is super good and there is a great atmosphere. Only problem is once I came and they said there was a 4 hour wait! 4 hours?! Why not just say you aren't accepting any more people?"}
{"text":"Went there on a friday nite so cant expect service right away. However, still took way too long to get seated. Food was ok, but nothing that really stands out. My biggest gripe however is when I went there, it was taking forever and a day just to get get my car into the parking lot. They were having valet parking. I ended up just driving thru the neighborhood and parking on residential street. Literally took me 15 minutes to drive my car 100 yards due to this stupid valet parking. Just end the valet parking and let people park their dam cars in the lot and get on with their nites! How frustrating that was!!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit (after a rude hostess at another Fox restaurant turned us off while calling for reservations) and we loved it!  The wait staff was attentive and demonstrated a real team effort.  We started with a Tempe craft beer and crusty bread.  I opted for their signature fried chicken (I waited for it as the menu stated) but was disappointed :-( which was the only reason for 4 out of 5.  The outside was far to crispy to bite into and had to be peeled away to salvage the chicken.  Pretty over cooked I guess.  The wife had the meat loaf which was more than awesome.  The mashed potatoes were very creamy and tasty.  

The menu is short but with a wide variety of selections.  

Atmosphere was a younger generation, so it felt good to me celebrating my 65th birthday.  Lots of activity in the game area, fun family style digs.  Convenient with plenty of lot parking (valet available) and street parking if you're early.  We'll drive the 40 minutes again just to experience the fun."}
{"text":"Heard about this place in Tucson but happened to be in Tempe and wanted to give it a try. Reserved a table through open table for 7:30 thinking it was going to be hard to get in to on a friday night Arrived at 7:15 and was seated immediately. Tess, our server, came right to our table. She was wonderful. Took care of our every need. Made suggestions to us that were spot on. The pretzel bites and cheese fondue was wonderful and practically a meal by itself. Heard the fried chicken was great and the reviews were not wrong. Entree of friend chicken came with mashed potatoes and gravy, Cole slaw and a biscuit. So much food! I will have leftovers for tomorrow. It was wonderful and reasonably priced for the quantity. They had live music which just added to the enjoyment of the evening. Will certainly come back. Well done!"}
{"text":"We tried this place yesterday and it was very disappointing. This restaurant is extremely loud so if you're planning on getting together and catching up with friends it's a bad idea. We were seated at 8:50 it took us over an hour to get 3 sandwiches. I had the grilled chicken club and my chicken was burnt and bitter. The bun was so soaked in whatever sauce they had on it that it fell apart when I picked it up. It was a mess. My fiancé got the prime rib dip and his food smelled just like dog food. Our friends split the Italian sandwich and they were happy with it. The fresh pretzels are the only reason I give this place 2 stars. The staff was nice but it's so hard to distinguish the difference between employees and customers. Very casually dressed no name tags. Might give the Las Vegas location a shot assuming service might be a little better but won't be returning to this location"}
{"text":"I have visited Culinary Dropout over a handfu of times.  I give 5 stars for the pretzel and cheese fondue as well as the homeade carmel corn but the other dishes I have tried have just been o.k.  
I will be back for my favorites but I probably will not venture to try anything new."}
{"text":"I've been here two times. The first time, so delicious. If I were to have done my yelp review it would have been five stars at the time. My second time at this place not so much. My food simply wasn't not as amazing as it was the first time. I ordered about sandwich this time and honestly, it came out about room temperature. A little disappointing."}
{"text":"The service great and the food was delicious..I had the fried chicken. Good stuff. No complaints and the ambiance was perfect.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Liked this place so much we came back twice in our visit to Phoenix. Love the huge outdoor area with firepits and a wide array of games. We played cornhole, ping pong, and shuffleboard. Great place to come as a group or as a date night. A must try when in the area."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place more than I did. It is massive but I think there's empty space that is still underutilized. They should put in more seating around the patio so people can chill while waiting. It's loud and fun. Good place to hang out with a group of friends. Food and drinks are pricey for the environment though. Be prepared to wait if you come during peak times. Tip: Don't be rude by keeping game equipment while you're not using them; give them back if eating/drinking so others can enjoy."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today had some pretty interesting dishes.  Great waitress (forgot name, pretty Asian girl) very nice.  

We got the wrong salad on accident. It happens and were not at all upset. Our waitress brought the manager (taller white guy) over and truly impressed us.  They seemed sincerely upset about the mistake and took care of us. 

Mistakes happen, it's inevitable but what a business does after is proof of a good operation.  Outstanding service, very professional and should be a model for any and all restaurants! 

If you want to know how to run a restaurant, invest in a visit here and take notes. As a former GM I hate seeing shitty service, good service should be recognized."}
{"text":"The team at Culinary Dropout did a great job. Josh and Billy the servers were amazing! They handled a party of 22 people without a hitch. The food was great, hot and all came out together. Loved the atmosphere. Thank you for making us feel so welcome. Our Holiday Party was a success!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and definitely one of the better \"chains\" I've been to. I hope it pops up everywhere!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Recommended from a friend. Loved the open vibe and choices of seating between, couches, bar, and table tops. I had the fried chicken and the BEST!!  Not greasy, great crust, and so white and tender in the middle. Service was also top notch. Relaxed environment of college kids, locals, and business guys. Open air type place in some sections and feels like a huge open covered barn. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Love love their food and their service is always on point! Easy to get to location out of the hustle and bustle of downtown Tempe. Great place to meet up with friends coworkers or even family get togethers. Plenty of seating and fun games. It's a definite go to!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. The pretzel fondue appetizer was amazing. The live band was great. Great place!"}
{"text":"I am a NEW Fan. The food was too die for. Our server, Olivia was very welcoming and wasn't too busy to help us with our questions about some of the food and beverage options. Will put Culinary Dropout on my \"need to visit\" again list when in town."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience. Went twice in a short time and had excellent service and food. The steak tacos were excellent and the shrimp ceaser was filled with shrimp. Definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Met my sister and niece here for dinner. What an amazing place. EVERYONE that works here was so friendly and attentive. The waitress Brittney, as well as two others (Lexie & Justin) were three of the most personable people I have had the pleasure of attending to my needs while dining. And Britney went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed.
We started the evening off with house made potato chips & onion dip as well as the pretzels & fondue which would have thrown us over the top, however, we were warned to not overdo it, so that we might enjoy the dinner menu. We then moved on to the main course which was extremely satisfying. We split two main dishes between the three of us, the Sweet Potato Cannelloni and also the Bistro Steak, and were NOT disappointed. I'm not sure which I loved more, so I will just say order either and you will be happy!
Not to be outdone, may I say kudos to the bartender for serving up one of the smoothest Lemon Drops I've had in quite a while.
I will definitely make this a go-to place when I'm back in the Scottsdale-Phoenix area again"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! If you want to escape the club culture of Mill then come here! While there is live music some nights, it is just a place to relax and have good food and drinks. I really like that there are games to play: corn hole and ping pong! One of my favorite bars/restaurants in Tempe."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!!!!! Great beer great service not one thing to complain about!!! I would recommend to go here and go here now. This place is great. Just be ready because it crowded because it's amazing"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's laid back and has an awesome burger. The sweet potato kale salad with shrimp very yummy. Out door patio is open and comfy. This is really good pick to bring a large group of people with picky eaters! There is something for everyone:)"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend to catch up I have a service dog and a with all the things going on in the world I was questioned that's not a big deal but they question me incorrectly and I informed them so It should not happen again I was promptly sat and given a drink probably from the bar I played ping-pong and when sat unfortunately I was not giving my drink and food for a very long time with my friend and his girlfriend complained wanting to leave they sat us immediately and took care of the entire bill showing then this is not a common occurrence I as a true patron and being here multiple times can a test this is not a common thing. 

All in all they were understanding about learning more about service dog laws and when the complaint happened they would not accept us leaving with a bad taste and promptly fixed it"}
{"text":"Consistently great food in a fun atmosphere. Attentive service, quality food, live music, and great drinks make this a real winner!"}
{"text":"This was a really fun place! The Marcona almonds were tasty - as was the crusty starter bread, olives and cheese. While my husband found the fish and chips to be \"ok\", my Kale salad with salmon was fabulous...maybe best salad I've had at a restaurant! We went on a Thursday night and really liked the duo playing music. Music made it a little hard to talk but I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is perfect for people watching and trying new drinks. 

This review is based off two visits. 

My first experience at C.D. was just to meet a girlfriend for drinks the opening weekend. The place was packed with the typical 'Dale crowd - I was prepared for this. It was very hard to get a bartender's attention. It was almost that they didn't see beyond those seated in a bar stool. My girlfriend and I had to go to the service well to get noticed and although the servers were probably annoyed, that's the only way we could get served. The drinks were good, pours were a bit on the weak side, but the atmosphere was great. Live music starts at 9pm or so. 

My second experience at C.D.: 

A few girlfriends and I decided to give it a try about three weeks after it opened on a rainy Saturday evening. Of course we knew to get there early so we wouldn't be waiting too long for a table. We arrived at 6pm and were quoted 30 minutes for a table. An hour later, I stopped the manager and asked him if he knew how much longer it would be until we got sat and he came back with menus in hand. We were sat at a round table with great big, comfortable chairs right in the middle of the dining room. We were quite comfortable and understanding of the long wait - especially because no one was opting to sit on their heated, yet damp patio. 

For an appetizer, we started with the delicious pretzels with cheese fondue. Deli-sh! I prefer mustard, but tasted the cheese and it was great. There was enough cheese for dipping the french fries that came with the meal. 

The entree menu is full of food that I would consider to be comfort food - choices that you know you may regret eating after you inhale the delectable food. I opted for the Turkey Pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun as suggested by the helpful manager that took us to our table. I, by far, had the best meal of my girlfriends. Two girls split a burger and salad (the burger meat tasted very fattening and \"meaty\" to me) and our other girlfriend tried the Prime Rib sandwich, which was tasty and a huge sized portion. 

Overall, the food was good - but nothing too great. Our service was fantastic, once we got sat. The bussers were definitely cute as well. I would suggest Culinary Dropout as a place to see and be seen and for drinks. You can skip the food unless you really want to sit. The bar stools are hard to come by."}
{"text":"I came here for my anniversary with my boyfriend for the first time ever and was not disappointed. We went to the bar for a cocktail first before we sat and got excellent service from the bartender, he was very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations. We then sat at our table and our waitress was so pleasant and I am sad I don't remember her name to give the credit. But in general the food was amazing, definitely recommend the Brussels and nachos! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the best experience eating dinner at CD last night. From the min we walked in we were greeted and seated very quickly. The restaurant has a nice ambiance and cool decor. THe food was Amaaaazing and our drinks! I will def be back next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"We visit this location quite often and service is usually very good. I was very disappointed last night. Made a reservation for 6 at 5:45 on a Friday evening. Hostess refused to let us sit inside which was unusual because they don't usually take
Patio reservations. There were several open tables inside when we arrived, while we were there and when we left. It was 108 that day and incredibly hot on the patio. I don't understand why we couldn't sit indoors when there was availability. Shame on you guys, you've lost my business. Dinner was miserably hot and unpleasant."}
{"text":"Really great food, nice atmosphere, and great service. The wait staff was very friendly and personable. We got the fried chicken and the turkey and pastrami sandwich. Both were great."}
{"text":"Made reservations on open table, they said they couldn't find them.

We sat at the bar, there was literally a fly in our drink.  The bartender offered to make us a second drink then charged us for it!!

It was not a good experience!!"}
{"text":"This place has such a good atmosphere. They have a good menu with good options. There is a ton of seating. I'm told this is place is the largest restaurant, by the size of the building, in town. It does seem pretty expensive based on what you get but I would say the environment makes up for it. The staff members are great. They really take care of the customers. I love it when a server keeps drinks topped off and can give us their opinion what to get on the menu.

There is always a lot going on in this area but there seems to be a good amount of parking right at the restaurant so you don't have to park in a parking garage.

I can see myself coming here again in the future but not very often. The price is a pretty big deterrent for what you get."}
{"text":"Such a cool place to grab a meal or happy hour. The atmosphere is always lively, but it works for a work lunch too (not rowdy, quick service, and tons of tables). The menu doesn't have a ton of vegetarian options but the few they have (pasta, salad) or that you can make vegetarian (burgers without the meat) are good.

I especially like the corn and mushroom cannelloni, which is an awesome vegetarian entree. The flavors are complex and satisfying, and the dish is filling on it's own without an appetizer or salad. The salads are decent sized, but I find I usually need something extra to make it a meal (some cheese and crostini from the tapas menu, a side of fries)."}
{"text":"Loved this place today! The vibe is really good. Very open setting. Super cool to see in kitchen. Everything local, fresh, creative. I was there on a business lunch so I only took a couple pics. Our server provided several great recos. We shared the amazing pretzels and dipping sauce. The pretzels we're golden and salted.  
I went with a recommended burger black and blue style and I had it wrapped in lettuce. Amazing taste. Loved the pickle and salad. I hope to come back next trip and experiment with the menu. Great service also."}
{"text":"Started on a positive greeting at the door upon arrival. The place has a great vibe. Since dining solo grabbed a seat at the bar. Promptly and pleasantly greeted by Louie. Super chill and gave me both beverage and food menus. There are so many interesting items to chose from. Hard to choose. Louie made some great recos describing the items. I decided on the Prosciutto deviled eggs. Craze great. The prosciutto is crisp, the deviled eggs are perfect and there is a taste of truffle oil. Let's say a flavor explosion.  Louie reco'd a lovely Pinot Noir. 
I chose the Ahi salad as my main course. Nice steak size pieces perfectly seared along with crisp lettuce, cashews and great Asian flavor. 
Service and food 5 star. Thanks Louie I'll be back and reco to friends. And to try the Jerky."}
{"text":"Leaves something to be desired... I've been here a few times because my mom LOVES this place. I, however, do not. I've frequently been served food that is cold (especially their fondue - I'm sorry, but that little candle isn't going to melt the block of cheese you've served to me). The food itself is over-spiced, unimaginative, and blah. Not to mention, I've been left running to the bathroom probably every time.

Its a fun atmosphere, so if you're looking for a fun place to grab drinks, this place is great. If you're looking for good food, seek elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday at 8:30 with a reservation. We had a simple and lovely waitress who took a while. She kind of looked like an elf. 
I wish she had asked if we could sit on the patio area. But she didn't. 
Anyway, I ordered the pretzel fondue and it was delicious. I then looked at the menu again and I noticed how overpriced everything was. So, I ordered some fries and the cheese fondue as a dip. 
My friends ordered the club sandwich and a soup and salad. They were mediocre at best. (I tasted the food. Bah!)
Everything in this place screams Hard Rock and the ambience is great. But the food is way overpriced and under made. Oh and the tapas are $8 an oz for cheeses and meats. Hamon de Seranno at market price was $18. That's more than an oz of silver. I would of given the place 1/5 stars initially. 

The only reason why I gave this place 3/5 stars were the drinks. They're $12 for mixed drinks, but they don't skimp on the alcohol. And they're good too. That's it."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing! We made a reservation for 7 people. Unfortunately, we had to wait for our table longer than when our reservation was made. BUT, the staff genuinely apologized for the extended wait. Also, they provided a free appetizer to snack on which was very very help to prevent us(me) getting hangry. Ordered the fried chicken dinner, which was very delicious. Also got the brown paper bag special, which is a random cheap beer in a brown paper bag with a small travel size of random vodka or tequila for $5. Definitely will come back or recommend  this place based off the great customer service. But the food was phenomenal as well."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the service.. we had a 8pm res, which we were seated on time, but the appetizers were served 20 min apart and the girl didn't light the candle for the cheese on our pretzel bites.. the food portions were small compared to the price! 
Plus the waiter only asked once if we needed a refill on drinks.. disappointing!"}
{"text":"French dip is off the chain! A must eat in Scottsdale. Staff is well trained and friendly."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was ok. Forgot our order but it's ok. We got pretty full with the burger. We got to sit right by the fire so it was really nice and cozy."}
{"text":"My new, all-time absolute favorite place for fried chicken!!!! This is an excellent place for a great culture and fun food! The Arizona Restaurant deal is superb! The beef tacos are also a great choice if you enjoy a little spice  I would not recommend the s'mores desert because the Carmel is slightly excessive and just the flavor of it wasn't my favorite. But excellent service!!!"}
{"text":"Adam and I went here for brunch one Sunday morning before REHAB, the pool party (YELP review to follow) and it was great. We sat outside and it was early so beautiful weather. Our server was awesome and so funny. Our food was delicious and came out very quickly. The coffee was delicious and I loved the coffee cup they served it in. Overall, it wasn't fancy or ghetto, just a quick little spot to grab good food!"}
{"text":"Pros: Food was great! We got the pretzels and fondue which was delish. My eldest got the pan seared steak and he loved it. My youngest got the Italian salad and he was pleased. My man got the ribs and said they were the best ever. I got the vegetarian entree, sweet corn cannelloni, and I would def go back for it. So, that being said, the food made everything else worth it. 
Cons: it was very noisy, but we were at the hard rock hotel, so that's to be expected. My biggest issue was the temperature. It was about 107 outside and for whatever reason they had the wall behind the bar open, which let all the hot air in. I was literally sweating balls the whole time and it was after 9. Uffff. I guess it helps with their beer sales."}
{"text":"A $550 dining experience that turned into thousands of dollars. 

We had reservations for a party of 13 on May 11th to celebrate my daughter's graduation. We were seated at a table very close to the door nearest the valet parking. Our waiter was great and the service (drink and food arrival) was a tad on the slow side so there were a few times that different members of our party went outside to take pictures, grab presents from their vehicles and smoke. During this time, the doors were wide open with other customers going in and out while security was also standing at the door. 
I myself went outside numerous times during our two and a half hours at the restaurant and each time was given a \"once over\" by security. I thought nothing of it at first and chalked it up to people watching on security's part. 
We all finished our meals and some of our party ordered deserts and some ordered celebratory shots. Soon after, our waiter informed us we were cut off. When asked why or by who, he stated he had no idea why because it didn't come from him or the bartender but came from security. Alrighty. Squared up our bills and went to leave. Everyone started heading towards the parking lot while being followed by two security guards. We had two designated drivers whose vehicles were already full so my son called an Uber and while waiting for their ride, everyone waited with them by his car while he grabbed a few personal items. When the Uber showed up, they got in and everyone else walked to their vehicles (including back to the valet area). While pulling out, the Uber vehicle was flipped off by one of the security guards who were now both standing at the doors facing the larger parking lot. No one thought much of that at the time other than a \"WTF\". Until the next morning. 
My son's car was vandalized beyond belief. A smashed drivers side window, dents and footprints from them kicking the car, keyed everywhere and even damn puncture holes in the body. A mint condition 1993 Nissan 300 ZX. Which, by the way, is a very rare historic vehicle. 
It was brought to the GM's attention and she came out and took pictures of the vehicle. When asked about security cameras, she stated that they were only on the door by valet. She went and looked at the cameras and stated that her managers personally walked security out to their vehicles at 1:45 am and that it was on camera. Managers walk security out to their cars?? Shouldn't it be the other way around? We asked to see the tape as we should have been on it as well being followed by security and she offered to send it but never did. 
She offered to speak with her night staff that came in later in the day and call back. As you can imagine, no one knew or saw anything. When she asked if there was anything she could do, short of paying to have the vehicle fixed, what exactly was she offering? So, we asked for a refund of the amount spent at the restaurant to offset the thousands in repairs and she seemed surprised we even suggested it. She said it was the first she was hearing about any bad service. That's not the point. We didn't complain about the restaurant itself but the destruction of our property and since SHE ASKED what she could do, we took her up on it. No dice. She then pointed out that \"this happens all the time\" as if we aren't the only unfortunate customers. 
We then got a call from Erica, the Regional Operations Manager who not only offered the refund knowing how expensive the repairs would be but also was way more interested than Alyssa, the GM looking into what happened. She also informed us that security has zero say when a customer is cut off. It's strictly up to managers and bartenders. Neither of which came to our table, and even served my daughter another drink immediately after being cut off. She also seemed very surprised to hear that this is a common occurrence and it was not to her knowledge. 
Hopefully security gets their shit together and this is looked into and it never happens to anyone else. Cameras definitely need to be placed outside the doors facing the larger lot."}
{"text":"The food is perfect!  The name of the restaurant may depict that the food wouldn't be good but wow! It was delicious!  They need to open a Culinary school. . Glad our hotel recommended this place."}
{"text":"Pretzels with fondue to start. Loved!
Butternut squash cannoli for the entree. The smokiness of the shallots/mushrooms made it divine. Very light and not too heavy.

My better half had the ribs which were very sweet but not spicy at all which the description made it seem, we wouldn't order this item again but everything else would make us go back for a second trip.

 No wait time, excellent service."}
{"text":"No stars, but I had to do one. The prime rib dip sandwich fell everything short of satisfactory. There was no care involved in the preparation of this \"prime rib\", it was lunch meat warmed with melted cheese no better than you would find at subway. $17 for this sandwich is highway robbery."}
{"text":"I don't like that we have to valet or park Teo blocks away. The waiters are young  and nice looking . We tried their fried chicken  and butternut squash  pasta . The chicken  was cooked perfectly  . The skin a little  on the salty side . Cole slaw was fresh and unique  . Service was good . The biscuits  was over cooked"}
{"text":"Three stars or four stars, three stars or four stars...I had such a tough time figuring out where Culinary Dropout belongs on Yelp and I am resting at a hesitant three for now.  

Love the rock-emphasis decor, kitchen employees, and music.  I heard some great songs that I've never heard in a restaurant so props to that right off the bat.  

I went as part of a huge, crazy, birthday extravaganza so the service aspect is to be expected as a little on the slower side.  Their beer selection is pretty formidable, while their tap beer selection is definitely lacking.

I tasted the fabled pretzels with cheese dipping sauce and yes, they were probably the one thing that would suck me back into this place against my will.  The rib tip pasta wasn't bad, it was filling but seemed to lack a certain pizazz that would leave me wanting more.

The prices were definitely on the lower side for the area.  I'll probably come back here, and I'll probably like it but I probably won't know why."}
{"text":"This place is FABULOUS!! Food is great.. Service is great.. And love the ambiance!! I highly recommend the 36 hour ribs!!! Out of this world!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place, I really do. I continue to go back and every time I do, I forget about the hack live bands that play at night. Immediately puts me in a bad mood. Everything else: service, ambience, crowd, food is above average, but if I have to listen to a shit cover of \"Wonderwall\" by Oasis on  a Friday night again....I might shoot myself."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Fox concept, great atmosphere and good take on new American foods.  

The fried chicken is amazing, Ma' The meatloaf is good, MAC burger is awesome and the mussels were tasty.

The cheese and meat plate is great starter, bit pricy but good.

Plus good looking staff."}
{"text":"Get the pretzel foudue! - this place was great and a great suprise, we didn't know it was here."}
{"text":"So so crowd, some cool areas to sit that make you feel like you are outside. Had a few drinks at the bar, but what we ordered to eat first rooks forever and then never came. That was disappointing. The drinks were good, bartenders (several) seemed to be extremely busy, but not sure why with 3 people at the bar. Would like to see this place on a busier night. The bathrooms are unique, they have a hand washing station that the men and women share."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! Bar area with free games to play while you wait. Reservation on time. Food was Great! Service was Great! Everything was made from scratch. Had the freshly baked pretzel rolls with cheese fondue, soft fresh hot baked!!!  Fried chicken was very crispy and had a slightly sweet taste, exceptionally tasty!!  Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Culinary dropout is really good and the vibes and atmosphere make it even better! It's the perfect place for a group to go to because the drinks and food are all very authentic and traditional."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is the BEST restaurant at the Hard Rock. They have a fun staff. We loved our server Benny and the others that took care of us. Their happy hour is really good, they make amazing drinks - Bourbon Mules, a Dark and Stormy, or if you fancy tequila they have a great selection of spirits. And all their juices are freshly muddled. Their food is awesome too. For snacks, they make their own potato chips with an onion dip but my favorite thing on their menu are the hot pretzel bites served with a fondue dipping sauce. RIDICULOUS!!!! I ate those 2 nights in a row and could polish off an order all by myself. For happy hour they are half price too!!!  They also have a kick ass kale and corn salad and to-die-for SWEET POTATO CANNELLONI. The pasta is so thin so you can taste the filling which is a beautiful mixture of smoked shallots, mushrooms, snap peas, and parmesan. LOVE this place and wish there was one in LA!!!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty good and the meal was comped based on my play (read: losing) which keeps this from being 1-star. My friend and I shared the ribs ($27) and the fried chicken ($22) and both were honestly, terrible, especially given the price. The ribs were dry, tough, and for some reason very salty (the rub) while the chicken was very dry and lukewarm. My friend is a big guy and didn't finish his meal and honestly went to Capriotti's for a sandwich afterwards. I tried this place a few years ago when it first opened and did not have a good experience but gave it the benefit of the doubt because it was new but it doesn't seem like things have changed too much which is unfortunate given the name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place off the strip, just didn't feel like dealing with parking and then walking through a long line of slot machines to get something to eat. So Yelp to the rescue. We were right by the Hard Rock Cafe Hotel so we decided to give it a try. 

The waitress was friendly and we were immediately seated. 

I took the advice of my fellow yelpers and immediately ordered the puffy pretzel bites with cheese fondue. Oh my gosh just order them. You get a basket of 12 warm pretzels. They are not hard and accompanied by cheese fondue.  Perfect for sharing. 

We then shared a turkey burger which was also excellent. What I liked most about the place was that it was nice but not too pretentious. After all, it is VEGAS. We weren't ordering a lot of food and we didn't get any attitude. There were some dressed up people but others were casual.  They have a pretty big beer and whiskey list.

They had a live musician playing on a stage. The music was entertaining but not overpowering. It was a cold and rainy day but if not I would love to sit outside on the patio- they have fire pits- a great place for a big group."}
{"text":"Such an amazing experience! Just moved to tempe and Tiffany was full of knowledge of the area. Made the dinning experience unforgettable. She is truly one of a kind."}
{"text":"While the Hard Rock is a bit off the strip, believe me it's worth the drive for happy hour! They have a large indoor seating area and a fun outdoor patio section with a view of their fancy pool. 

Happy hour is Monday-Friday from 3-6pm. All of their draft beers are available in a small mug for $3! They have a good selection ranging from Chainbreaker White IPA, Lagunitas Pilsner, Stella, Apricot Hefeweisen, Coors light, etc. They also serve well drinks and sangria for $4.  

You can't go wrong with the happy hour snacks. My top two recommendations are the kale salad and pretzels with fondue. The salad is the perfect size to pair with an appetizer and includes unique toppings like beets, cauliflower and goat cheese. The pretzel fondue is really something special! It's a blend of provolone and havarti and is served with soft pretzel rolls. I have begged for the recipe and even tried recreating it myself, but haven't figured it out yet. We have also tried their burgers and bourbon black bottom pie and have been very impressed."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with sister and it's excellent. I had the bbq burger and it was amazing. My sis had the chicken salad and she said it was equally as amazing. Their cocktail menu is impressive and the bartenders are generous with their liquor portions. Our server was friendly and upbeat as well. She even gave us some recommendations for future Phoenician stops. This place is highly recommended by folks visiting from Wisconsin- or any where! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is normally good but when they have nobody here their service is awful!!!! So slow! Waited 20 minutes to get our drinks and then even longer for food. Server was probably high."}
{"text":"I've always heard mixed reviews from friends about this place. I finally broke hesitation after years to try it in Scottsdale. First off starting with the charcuterie board, it was actually really good. Grilled asparagus and roasted Brussels sprouts were bangers. I recommend the Brussels for sure. We underestimated our appetite And ordered pretzel bites, and bbq pork nachos. All were really good. My friend then ordered a cheesesteak dip, another ordered a full rack of rib which was not a certified banger. In overall I think it's a great place to hangout with cool interior. The food was good and I'll make sure to moderate over ordering next time!"}
{"text":"A few friends came in town last night who were staying at the Hard Rock so I immediately said, let's try Culinary Dropout. I had heard so many things about this place that I thought it would be great. Maybe I had too many expectations but then again, it is the Strip so I should have high expectations. 

I got there a little bit before my friends and thought I would stop by the bar and grab a drink. I asked for a Menu and was only given the dinner menu. It was 5:30 and I had thought there was a Happy Hour but of course, that wasn't mentioned AT ALL since we all know the only important thing is to rip off tourists. Nice job there bartender chic. Now that I'm sitting at home, I check your website and find out that yeah, you kinda ripped me off. Nice. To add insult to injury the drink I did order wasn't what was on the menu. Yes she said that they were out of one of the ingredients, but I really question WHY? This is Las Vegas. THIS IS THE STRIP. You shouldn't be \"out\" of anything. 

My friends get there and we are seated outside, which was kinda nice. It was a pretty night in Las Vegas so it was nice to enjoy the weather and chat. Someone comes over and drops off what looks a lot like a sushi menu, but it was for their antipasti and appetizers. No one really said anything about it, because you know, it's normal to get a sheet of paper and a pencil to order your food??? My friend order some asparagus, which btw, never came. Let me point out that we ordered that and drinks then waited a little bit to order food, so how asparagus can't make it to the table is a bit confusing to me. 

I must remark on the server. Seriously hipster dude comes over and does the lame, \"Have you been here before.\" Servers need to stop that. Especially at Strip restaurants since well, IT'S A TOURIST SPOT. Unless you are going to conduct a game show to enable food ordering, I'm pretty sure I don't need this lame spiel about your restaurant and menu. I can read English and have never had a major mishap ordering dinner before. I know. Amazing as that sounds. I also don't need this dude to tell me how they were rated a top new restaurant by US Weekly or some such nonsense. If the food and restaurant are great then I'll know that when I leave. Let it stand on its own merits not some pseudo hype that you want to use to \"impress\" us silly tourists. 

We ordered our food and enjoyed conversation. It took a little longer than I would expected for fried food and a salad in a not-at-all full restaurant. My salad was good but it wasn't anything that jumped out in my mind. My girlfriend got the fried chicken. She said it was ok. Seeing that we're from Mississippi, we kinda know our fried chicken. She also commented on how it was WAY too sweet as well as the cornbread was WAY too sweet. Not shocking. This place is like all these other \"trendy\" restaurant popping up that have \"Southern\" food on their menu that they charge way too much for. They have no one in the back who can find the South on a map, let alone know how to cook food properly. They've just watched one too many episodes of Paula Dean and now think they now. Meh

We got our bill and handed the server my debit card and told him that I had the ONE drink and ONE salad. The rest was to be taken from the Hundred that my friends handed him. SEVERAL SEVERAL SEVERAL minutes later he comes back and asks them if they needed change. WHAT?!?! Just run my card and bring it as well as their change back and let them look it over. My friend replies, \"Well I don't even know how much it was since you needed to run her card.\" He IMMEDIATELY tells (not bring a check or anything) her the total and then just kinda stands there. It was a weird, and unnecessary, few moments. My friend replies, \"No just keep the change but bring her her credit card.\" He quickly runs over and runs my card and brings my receipt.

That is a tacky and pushy way to get your tip dude. Seriously. I can't believe that a server would ever do that to someone. I've worked in plenty of restaurants and a few here in Las Vegas and the only time I would say anything to that affect is if I had just that second picked up the check, not when  I've walked away and made calculations that amount to me assuming I deserve what's left over. It was a HUGE turn off on top of many turn offs. 

All in all I was very under impressed after all the hype I'd heard. I see absolutely no reason to ever go back there again. I definitely won't be recommending it and I have friends come in town ALL THE TIME. I'd give it one star but the atmosphere was kinda nice and I liked the patio. Though neither of those were great enough to get to go have mediocre food and get ripped off on drinks. I hope everyone else has a better experience than I do. For me I can think of dozens of restaurants in Las Vegas I'd rather go to. Heck, I would have been MUCH happier at Firefly down the road. Sigh...lesson learned"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place.  My niece was in town and I finally talked my guy into giving this spot a go.  We made reservations thru Yelp.  We had skipped lunch and a full day thus we arrived an hour early.  Plenty of tables open by plenty I counted over 5 and more outside that needed to be cleaned.  There was a young man and girl at the hostess table.  We asked if we could be seated early; they both were quick to point out we were early.  Then the young man said he could seat us but we would have to eat quickly as he would need the table back in an hour????  I have never in my life been asked something silly like this.  I just moved here and finally have a piece of home with me and you want me to rush my meal?   Wow!  Then to make it worse the girl states you are early what do you expect?    Then asks us to sit at the bar as it is \"family friendly.\"  If they worked for me and treated my clients this way,  it would be unacceptable. Less of condescending tone and more kindness.   We wanted to enjoy your restaurant and see what all the rave was about, sadly we did not get the opportunity."}
{"text":"The restaraunt is very noisy. Parking lot is oddly configurated.the waitress was friendly . However cold air was com I ng in from the side entrance. The food was good portion reasonable large green beanns were very fresh. The sauce on the meatloaf was sweet.we enjoyed their pretzels were good.after we had our d I nner service was lacking and our dinnerrt sizes were small"}
{"text":"This is my first time writing a review but I feel like I must just because I have had it with this place. We live very close to the Yard and have come here for multiple occasions. Every time I am blown away by how awful the service is. I understand that it is a busy place but people should have the common courtesy to acknowledge you when you are waiting at the bar. I will go out of my way to not come to the Yard again!!"}
{"text":"Came in for date night and the place looks awesome! Sampled a couple beers on draft from local breweries. We ordered the turkey pastrami, chicken chili and house salad. All the food was fantastic! (If they have the chili, order it! It's a sin not to) Shawn was a fantastic waiter too!"}
{"text":"Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue. JUST DO IT!!! Seriously the best thing on their menu. Total foodgasm.

Went out on a double date Saturday night. Pro tip: make a reservation. I absolutely LOVE the decor, ambiance, vibes, and music in this place. Definitely a place with heart and soul. I dig it.

Service: We arrived late (sorry!) and were still seated rather promptly. Staff and service and great. Shoutout to our awesome server who's from Napa, CA. The dude was wearing a green t-shirt...but so was everyone else on St. Pattys Day :P He was top-notch. I'd give 5 stars for service. He was friendly and really attentive. Drinks refills were appreciated. 
 
APPETIZERS:   
- Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue: giant soft pretzel bites that have the perfect amount of sea salt and flavor perfect for dipping into your cheese fondue pot. A bajillion times YAAAAAS! Super filling you'll feel fat & happy.
- Hot Wings: Culinary Dropout, you shouldn't include \"Hot\" in the title if you can't bring the heat. We both know they can be hotter! They're good, just not hot.

DRINKS:
Y'all don't mess around here! Definitely worth a shot.

ENTREES:
I was bummed to find out you ran out of grilled steak tacos :'(
- Meatloaf served with mashed potatoes and green beans: good stuff, especially if you are a meatloaf lover
- Tuna and chicken salads are both VERY GENEROUS portion sizes. Honestly not sure I necessary liked the taste and flavors of them, but there's a lot to eat if you do (-1/2 star)
- Steak: nicely cooked, fabulous plating and presentation. Too bad it was served cold (-1/2 star)

DESSERT: 
- Monkey Bread: Sooooo good! I wish I had left more room in my belly to enjoy and finish all of it by myself!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is located near PF Changs and Wildfish across the street from Scottsdale Fashion Square. You can find free parking in the garage underneath the restaurant. Don' let them sucker you into valeting. which is located just before the garage entrance. 

They serve happy hour specials throughout the restaurant. The service is a bit slow. We ordered the pretzels and fondue app to start and it took forever to come out to us. I thought we would get it with our dinner, luckily the fried chicken took so long that it wasn't something we really should have worried about. In all fairness they did warn me that it would take awhile, which I appreciated and did take forever but I was craving fried chicken after being out in the sun all day so I was going to get it damn it. So worth the wait. It was crispy deliciousnesseses. The pretzels and fondue were good too, but you don't get enough pretzels to scoop out all the yummy cheese.  

I have only sat outside so I didn't notice the loud music. Sit outside if you want to catch some great people watching (or car watching in Mike's case) from the patio and you want to be able to hear your dinner mate(s)."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a nice lunch or dinner. I had the kale salad with salmon it was super tasty and delicious. My daughter had the fish and chips.  They can't be beat. Sydney was our waitstaff She was knowledgeable and friendly--attentive , but not pushy. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken I have had. The fried crust was so delicate and flavorful while the chicken was super juicy... Drizzled with some honey made it that much better.  And the biscuit that was served with it was top notch !!!! My kids had fish and chips that were great !!  My wife really liked her ramen soup and she is quite the ramen aficionado.  I was told that the turkey Rueben is amazing and can't wait to go back to order it ( although the ribs being suvied  and prepped for 36 hrs will be hard not to order ).. Oh yeah definitely get the pretzel nuggets as an app!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken was pretty good!
Go for desert!!!
Monkey bread + coffee! Great!"}
{"text":"the bbq chicken wings are amazing. so delicious & of course 12 wings for 12 dollars is always a steal, especially when they're as well prepared and delicious as these. + the ranch is amazing!!!! definitely top ten wings I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great vibe, plenty of space inside (bar area in the front and back), games section with ping pong tables and corn hole boards, and the food is outstanding. The custom drinks were all excellent although the bartenders at the front (main) bar were at times inattentive and aloof. If you want to get away from the crowd go to the back bar (The Coop) - better service and calmer atmosphere. For Antipasti - the meat and cheese tray was delicious (make sure you choose the small batch beef jerky as one of your options). Soup & Share - the pretzels and provolone fondue are a MUST and one order is enough to serve three people. The pork belly nachos are also solid but could definitely use more pork belly. Entrees - the 36 hour pork ribs were good but nothing to write home about. The Korean Style Ribeye Cap is solid with a nice char on the outside and great flavor profile overall. The star was definitely the fried chicken. Crispy and flavorful breading on the outside, tender and moist chicken on the inside (it comes with three pieces). Overall this concept works and provides a very enjoyable drinking and dining experience."}
{"text":"**Edited: See note from CDO. I guess they didn't take over Sail Inn! Whew. I feel better. 

I've never been more flip-floppy (totally a word) about a restaurant in my life. I either love a restaurant or hate it and usually it's for a very Seinfeld-esque reason. The name is wrong. The font on the menu is pedestrian. The website is horrible. *none of which apply to CDO, btw. 
 
I'm kind of mad that CDO took over for the Sail Inn so for sentimental reasons alone; I don't like CDO. However, I was blown away by customer service and attentiveness of the servers that were assigned to my group for our work event. We were well taken care of and the tokens to use for drinks were way better than ticket methods. Having ping pong, corn hole and stage nearby make for the most fun atmosphere. 
Food is typical bar food and nothing I MUST HAVE and need to go back for. Restaurant week is coming up and I don't feel like I'm missing anything if I don't visit Culinary Dropout. 

For atmosphere, drinks and food; this is a great spot. I could also see myself coming here on a date or suggest it as a \"first date\" spot."}
{"text":"Some of the best (if not the best) fried chicken I've ever had. Prices were reasonable given the quantity and the service was excellent. Would recommend and will be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous HH spot! Trendy atmosphere, games, sports, $3 beer mugs, $4 well drinks, $3 Sangria {and more} and a variety of full sized apps for $6. {Of course, my favorite app is the pretzels + fondue} YUM! Both 'Yard' locations are on point! {Central Phoenix & Tempe} HH runs from 3pm-6pm Monday -Friday!"}
{"text":"What a nice Saturday night out.  Lovely ambiance and a great waitress.  They have some pretty cool things on the menu, and the appetizers we got were very good. I did order the Italian hoagie to split with my husband and he ordered a different entrée. The Italian hoagie is a little bit of a rip off but his dinner was fantastic. Portion sizes great and the location is very, very pretty. They do have valet parking you just have to pull around the side of the building and that made it very easy for one of our guests who was walking with crutches. The volume is a bit louder so if you are there to have a conversation make sure they either put you outside or up against one of the outside walls inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"When I first heard of this place, I was very intrigued by it. I loved the concept of the big open floor and live music. When a group of 11 of us went there last week, we were not impressed. The service was terrible.  It took 25 minutes for the waiter to come around and take our orders. After taking our order, the food took about 40 minutes to come out. Unfortunately, they forgot to place one of our orders. It took another 40 minutes for our friend to get his food.

As for the food, it was terrible, at least for me it was. I had the beer batter fish and chips and I felt like I was eating  cardboard. It was flavorless and tasted like it was fried in old, overused oil. However, my husband had a burger and he loved, but seriously, can you really go wrong with a burger? 

This place is just not amusing."}
{"text":"First of all this is the type of restaurant I could see myself conceptualizing so I was sold when I first was told about it. 

The food is great! The menu is definitely a mixed bag but all of it is d'lish. The atmosphere is awesome. Culinary would get only 4 and 5 stars if they fixed one thing. THEIR SERVICE!!! 

Your hostess suck! It's almost worse having a bad hostess than a server because the hostess is a persons first impression when entering a restaurant. The wait staff needs it's improvement as well.

Pros: 
- awesome food
- great atmosphere
- heart of downtown Scottsdale

Cons
- bad hostesses
- so-so service
- horribly long waits(they may forget about you on busy nights)
- snobby attitudes from staff at times"}
{"text":"We wait for one hour or more. They bring the food, was cold and nothing really good, expensive for the kind of food they have. Awful very disappointed, we came here for the good reviews but was not true."}
{"text":"Love their Kale salad.  The pretzels with fondue I rocks!  Great service. Fun energy.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was here last weekend and I'm honestly still a little confused about the entire premise of this restaurant but I also loved it so much at the same time!! Like is there multiple restaurants in one? Just different seating areas? Seemed like a big hodge podge in an amazing way. 

A few takeaways - drinks: first round is very light on the alcohol until you start asking for doubles and then they start pouring (just to make sure you're serious, I guess). The appetizers were phenomenal. I don't know what it is about Phoenix and their obsession and expertise in deviled eggs, but WOW so good. For my entree I ordered the pierogies and now that I'm thinking about them I want them right now. They were very creamy and hot. 

The only downside to this was that our server didn't even notice that one of the members in our party didn't receive their entree. Literally for about 10 minutes and then we had to tell her about it. We eventually got it but it was also still included in the bill. Didn't seem very professional for us to ask to have it removed when one member of our party was sitting without a meal for 10 minutes for the server to not even notice."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is a great place to get good food and be very social. This location is great for groups and has extra things to do because it is connected to The Yard so you can play ping pong, cornhole and shuffleboard. 

Lindsay was our server last night and she was great. Customer service was on point and she has a sense of humor. 

It's a little pricey but you're paying for the environment."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Attentive staff. Turkey pastrami sandwich was awesome. Great location. The s'mores dessert is a must have"}
{"text":"Was over at the Showcase room (located inside Culinary Dropout, in Tempe) 
for a corporate event.   My 1st time there and wondering how I missed this place!  
Convenient location, valet parking, great vibe and wonderful staff.  
Loved it and going back there for sure!   Hypnotist Jeff Bliss"}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Our server Bree was amazing. It was so crazy busy in there due to the ASU UOfA game and she brought all of our food out in a timely matter and was very attentive. Not to
Mention our food and drinks we're sooo amazing."}
{"text":"What a great experience! Saira our waitress was awesome...the ribs are amazing and her suggestion on adding kale to the salad! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great venue with whole Foods that taste amazing and is moderately priced. Menu is seasonal and expertly presented.  Since everything is prepared to order, do expect a little wait time.  This isn't Applebee's.  Worth every second of wait time. To wrap up the whole package, the staff was amazing.  Reservations are recommended as this place fills up quickly during peak periods."}
{"text":"late night fun with bridge, marcus and dani.

ah, Culinary Dropout, Old Town never fails at 1) a good time 2) an awesome dining/drinking experience 3) consistent good service 4) yummy pretzel bites with a delish cheese fondue and 5) one of the best desserts in Phoenix, their awesome monkey bread!

I love the overall vibe of this place and no matter the countless repeated visits to this location, I love their patio, the varying chandeliers, the comfy chairs and diversity of sizes, and just the look of the place. It's not trying hard with the cool factor. I haven't been dismayed once with bad service (yet.) and I hope never, and not once have I seen their host staff give on an upturned nose attitude. Kudos for that. 

I totally recommend the pretzel bites it's yum! I've had the same bites at Arrogant Butcher and for some odd reason Culinary's is best. The baked mussels is good as well. Entree wise, I do enjoy their fish and chips, as well as their fried chicken, and no complaints of the bistro steak but seriously it's not worth more than $20. But don't miss out on the monkey bread, that's like coke, it's addictively good. =P Oh, and when they're crowded just try to avoid sitting near the stage, let's just say, head nods and smiles will be the focal point of your dinner conversation and you oughta brush up on lip reading. Overall a good place. =)"}
{"text":"Awesome service, really a scratch kitchen made me my own vegan burger which was awesome! Great dx"}
{"text":"We hosted a company event for ~50 people at culinary dropout.   The staff was amazing, the food was great, and the space was perfect.    We had an issue because construction was taking place outside so the restaurant GM asked them if they could take a break for a couple hours until we finished.    The construction team obliged and we bought them lunch.     We were completely floored by the initiative and cooperation from both sides.    Setting up the event was a breeze with Lindsay.   Kelly and Marv from the wait staff were also amazing.   We'll be back!   Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"More pretzels and cheese, please!!!!! I mean really, they are THE BEST THINGS ON THE PLANET! I could seriously eat Culinary Dropout's pretzels and cheese every day for the rest of my life and never get sick of them. SO YUM. Anywho, during this visit, I tried to go a little healthier for my main dish to offset the pretzels and cheese and ordered the Italian Chopped Salad but subbed chicken instead of the Italian meats. It was FABULOUS! Super light and delicious. I loved the dressing and the pickled veggies throughout. I would 100% order it again! I know for a fact that I will be back soon for their pretzels and cheese, happy hour specials and maybe even that delicious salad again!"}
{"text":"Place is great. Had a wonderful server and the chef even made a special order shake. What great service . Loved this place.  Great prices too.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great spot for a date night. Patio is perfect when the weather is nice!

We started off with the pretzel bites fondue and the homemade potato chips. Yum and yum! Perfect snack while waiting for entrees. If I wasn't pregnant, I would have definitely enjoyed one of the many cocktails or beers. Pretty good selection!

Main course was the butternut squash canneloni for me and the meatloaf for my husband. The canneloni was absolutely delicious! Loved the sauce and veggies. Mmm! Husband really enjoyed the meatloaf and green beans. Only minor complaint is that the mashed potatoes were a little over-whipped for our tastes (we both prefer them to be a bit lumpy).

For dinner, we couldn't pass up the apple monkey bread and vanilla gelato. So, so good! It was like adding chunks of apple pie filling to monkey bread.

Definitely worth the trip from Gilbert! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time with my sister and her hubby who were visiting from out of town, and after a day of shopping this seemed like a good spot to get some lunch. I have to say the inside is pretty impressive, very sexy décor, I dig it. The napkins kinda weirded me out, mostly cause the dang thing shed all over my black pants, but whatev, no biggie.

I had the seared tuna salad with wasabi peas, and LOVED IT. Sis had the shrimp Caesar and said it was great, and hubby had the shaved prime rib sandwich, which he enjoyed thoroughly!

All in all good experience, will definitely be back. Seems like it would be a great place for happy hour or evening cocktails with the ladies before a night out !"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. Had a plate of incredible nachos and a beer to wash it down.  The outdoor dinning overlooks the pool area so it's good people watching , listening to music and enjoying a beverage and snack."}
{"text":"I went in today with a friend asking for a space inside for 15 people. We were taken outside and suggested we sit on the patio. We just walked a 5k walk about wanted to celebrate in a cooler atmosphere. The area we pointed had 3 people in it otherwise empty. We asked again to go inside, the said we needed a contract for that they didn't seem to want to explain any real reason why we couldn't sit inside. So our people were split up in 2 1/2 to 3 areas all apart from each other. I decided along with some others if they aren't willing to allow us to sit together, we won't give them our money. I ordered water and say, visited for an hour and left to go to another place to eat. Some stayed some left, but because they were so dating unaccommodating, just didn't feel the need to spend my money there. Bad move on your part, this crowd knows how to party. Not sure I'd go back. Looks like it could have been a fun place. I had looked forward to going there finally. Not the experience I wanted."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot for lunch meetings, happy hour, or just a nice easy dinner! Very upbeat atmosphere with great energy and good food and drinks! You can't go wrong with the pretzels and cheese and for a salad the crispy shrimp Caesar is amazing! Overall this is just a great place for a great time!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. Good location on where the restaurant is at. The beer selection is nice. As far as the food it's not the best. The appetizers on the cheese is so minimal. They need to have a cheese platter. The baked chips is good. This place is good to eat at if you want to drink and snack."}
{"text":"Drinks were thirst quenching; food was yummy (although the pork ribs were a little salty...the pretzel bites & provolone fondue was to die for); service was always with a smile; and ambience was perfect! Didn't get a chance to make it back into The Yard to play some games (having too much fun in the main dining room)...but next time!"}
{"text":"I love this spot! There is something for everyone on the menu. Good cocktails, good food, and GREAT vibes! If you're looking for a place to have a casual night out with friends, this is the perfect place. You can order a variety of drinks and snacks for the table, or come in for a meal, or sit out in \"The Yard\" and play outdoor games and ping pong.

I'd recommend their Pretzel Bites and Nachos. The Antipasti Boards are fun to try as well. I haven't had a bad drink there yet!"}
{"text":"The Culinary Dropout is super cool! This place is a hip, trendy, swanky casual atmosphere with a mix of decor, chandeliers, and awesome servers!

We loved Tori, who recommended the best selections and satisfied our cravings. For our comfort food appetizer, a must try is the Cheddar & Potato Pierogies - wow! Next was the Gorgonzola Chicken Salad with the most tender chicken, it literally melted in your mouth. Finally, we have the Sweet Corn Ravioli - this dish is the freshest, most amazing thing I have ever tasted! And for the finale, a chocolate s'more dessert that was better than any camp ground s'more this side of the flames!

This is a MUST go to place!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful design! We really loved the rugs, the eclectic mix of warm traditional furniture and industrial looks. There was a great band playing for lunch. Totally appropriate volume and really a treat. We shared antipasti and fried chicken. It was so delicious. The kitchen split our chicken for us so we didn't have any fights.  the server was so nice I wanted to invite him to eat with us."}
{"text":"So many reviews that talk about service and decor - 5 stars, but what about the food? Food-centric reviews are 3 stars or less. Lmao.  Pass.  

Came here mid day on a weekday. Saw five cars in a massive parking lot that probably holds 50 spots.  

Then, I see a sign that says valet only.  

Asked to self park- was told to park on the street.   

Typical trash restaurant that's just a marketing company that sells food.  Who pays for a valet with no customers in sight?  Serious question. 

I parked (and ate) elsewhere."}
{"text":"Been here twice now.  Once in AZ and once in Vegas.  Just don't get what all the hype is about.  Good Bar environment but for a restaurant it is super loud, service needs to improve, pricey for what you are getting...

I did enjoy the Turkey Pastrami and would recommend that if you go.

I will give it one more try before its either on or off the list of repeat dining recommendations.  There are so many options in Vegas."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night to meet friends for appetizers and drinks. I asked the waiter to recommend a cocktail based on the idea that I liked whiskey. He offered some fruity drink so instead I chose to get the mule. It was great! But it was also $11. 

The appetizers were well sized but a little on the pricey side. Their pretzels and cheese are the way to go! The music was so loud and awful at one point everyone was covering their ears. 


I recommend trying this place out during happy hour when no music is playing to enjoy their food.  The next time I went I just had the cheese (you can order individual cheeses to make your own little cheese board) and a beer and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"My wife and were in town for one night on our way to visit the Arizona deserts and we stopped in here for an early dinner... Wow!
My Pub Burger with fries, complimented was a side of freshly chopped jalapeños was delicious! And to finish our dining pleasure, we wrapped it up with fresh-baked Monkey Bread for dessert. Double tasty! Also, our ASU server, Shawn, was very friendly, attentive and engaging, adding to the experience. Love it!
The Culinary Dropout building was originally a retail lighting store for over fifty years and the current application of subdued lighting reflects that history, as well as creating a relaxing, casual environment.
Visit... you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We dined at culinary dropout in October and loved it.  We decided to bring back some friends for dinner Sunday night.  The food was great as expected,  the service was ok,  had to ask for silverware,  short changed $1 on payment.  My biggest issue and probably the reason I will not return is that towards the end of the night they begin cleaning the floors,  using cell phone flashlights to illuminate the floor, it was so distracting and rude. Here we are trying to enjoy the evening and we have bright flashlights surrounding us.  I have never experienced anything like it."}
{"text":"This place is HUGE! Couches can be reserved as well as the back room area. There was a group of 25 of us and there was a spot reserved along with buffet style appetizers. This included a large meat/cheese/nut board, small sandwiches and chips. There was an operating bar back there that made for fast service.

Ping pong tables and a bean bag toss area are here too. The paddles, balls and bean bags can be used for a small deposit/fee. This is certainly not your normal eating/drinking establishment, and that's a good thing!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for drinks and appetizers with friends. Their meats and cheeses are to die for! The pretzels and fondue also cannot be beat. Their cocktails are unique and delicious. If you are a Moscow Mule fan like me, you will love their different varieties! One of my favorite mules is made with tequila, grapefruit, jalapeno, and ginger beer....SO yum!  :) The games (tailgate toss/ping pong) and open vibe make for a really great hangout spot to meet friends, celebrate a birthday or bring out of town guests. I know for a fact that i'll be back soon! (Especially since it is FINALLY cooling down in the Valley!) Their HH prices are also spot on!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks are fantastic even though they are overpriced. I've been here twice and the first time I enjoyed the huge serving of mussels and the second time I went off of the bread and cheese menu which was fantastic. You can't beat having a great meal and then playing ping pong for an hour with drinks afterwards."}
{"text":"In this place I can see the kid who dropped out of culinary school to tour with a band.  This place is rock and roll refined.  There is a sense of culinary knowledge without the pomp and circumstance.  

The after school special cocktail is a raspberry infused michelada with Modelo unceremoniously delivered in the can.  The brunch menu is spot on.  The Cap'n Crunch french toast was awe-inspiring.

The biggest knock on this place is their lack of Red Bull.  Apparently, the whole Hard Rock campus is devoid of Red Bull due to some contract limitations....how Rock and Roll."}
{"text":"Came in from KCMO and ate here with some friends! So good! I had the Pub Burger and it was very good. Others had the ribeye and they said it was fantastic! My sister had fried chicken and loved it. Drinks are also awesome! 

Ok I've been back here two more times since my initial visit. Still love it so much. I've had the meat loaf and filet (can't remember exactly what it's called but it's amazing). Also, you have to try the pretzel bread with fondue!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant.  Went here on a whim after getting stranded in Vegas post-Hurricane Sandy.  The pretzels and cheese fondue are to die for, so do NOT miss them.  The build-your-own meat and cheese plate is amazing, and everything that comes out of the kitchen looks phenomenal.  The furniture inside is gorgeous and the exterior has a great campfire feeling to it.  Staff was awesome as well as amazingly helpful in recommending a good place for us to go that night to party.  I will most definitely be coming back here my next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Place    Fried chicken was amazing the prosciutto deviled eggs  the bacon  Bloody Mary   The. Cheese   Plate."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! I enjoyed a beautiful Mothers Day Brunch with the gorgeous weather and amazing service,  it was a great way to start my day! 

We were seated at the indoor/outdoor section,  great view of the pool area and quiet enough still to enjoy my amazing company.

Started out with the bacon vodka bloody mary! Omg, mouth watering to say the least. It wasnt strong and it didnt inhabit that overly strong vodka taste. It was just right! 5 stars!!

I then had the lobster benedict. Large peices of lobster, served over a poached egg and sauce to top off its amazingness!!  

Definitely recommend this super trendy spot for a brunch day with the ladies or a day date!!"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place since before it opened, and finally got to give it a go this week! Unfortunately we were still full from lunch, so we didn't get to eat as much as we would have liked, so I'll review based on what we did have...
Our server was great. She was super helpful, and helped us decide on cocktails, which were awesome. My husband had the Bells n Whistles, a spicy whiskey cocktail (don't order if you don't like spicy!) and I ordered a sparkling strawberry gin martini (can't remember the name but it was delicious!) We ordered the pretzel bites with fondue and the burrata (yeah, we like cheese, what about it?). The pretzel bites were...ok. A little less than warm for my liking. The cheese sauce (more sauce than fondue) was yummy. The burrata was OMG. I would definitely get it again. It was served with compressed pears, bacon syrup, walnuts, and greens, and the flavors and textures were all perfect together. 
Like I said, by this point we were already full so we called it a night, but we definitely plan on coming back again and again until we have tried all the yummy things on the menu!"}
{"text":"The good: Our waitress was absolutely stellar.  Very friendly, knowledgeable and fast. The decor is interesting and unique with a nice open layout.

The bad: They were out of one of the cheeses and two of the beers that I wanted to order, that's just unacceptable.  The band playing was a pretty weak cover band and they had the levels up so high that conversation was impossible.

The ugly: It's in Scottsdale so many of the patrons are of your typical douchebag variety.

I will come back and try a regular meal sometime but I'm not in a rush based on this experience."}
{"text":"First, I never drink whiskey unless it's St. Patrick's Day. I had a painful end to a long week and decided to switch to something other than my usual vodka. The Smashed Irishman lives up to it's name. The honey makes it smooth and sweet, but I could feel it workin' it's magic on me. I got it on the recommendation of our sever. He was wonderful, although I got a little jealous when two girls sat down at our communal table and he gave them the same flirty treatment. You know flattery gets you everywhere, don't deny it.  

I decided to give the gnocchi a try since it is my absolute favorite thing in the world. Well, Avanti's gnocchi is my absolute favorite and I wanted to do a little comparison. Culinary does it with sausage and mushrooms. It is delicious, although heavy. The sausage made it salty, but in a good way. I still must say that I love Avanti's version more and probably always will. Nothing beats them, NOTHING. Why am I so obsessed with their gnocchi? I think they put some sort of drug in it. 

Those two flirty girls next to me started with the grilled cheese sliders and again, my side of the table was jealous. Actually, they ate a surprising amount of food so I got to see a lot of what Culinary Dropout had to offer. Back to my side of the table, the butternut squash cannelloni was to die for (according to my friend, I did not taste it) and the fried chicken was better than KFC...  so, I guess everyone was at least satisfied."}
{"text":"LOUD AS HELL, but FUN!  If you're looking for a quiet conversation, this is NOT your place.  The food is pretty good.  My prime rib sandwich was ok.  Not great.  The pretzel ball fondue appetizer thing is worth the trip.  SNAP!  Great beers on tap.  FUN and creative!  I know it's cool for the waiters to wear whatever they want, but it also makes them hard to find, because they look like everyone else in there.  Fun idea, but maybe they should have hats or something distinctive."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and came out at a decent time but what lost two stars was the service. Our server Jaime, was far from friendly and didn't care about serving us. She wasn't friendly and fairly rude. We sat waiting for her to come around multiple times but was ignored. When we were ready for the check we had to ask a different server because she was more interested in talking to the servers at the well and the bar. When she finally brought the check she more or less tossed it down and left without a word."}
{"text":"I must say that I have been here before for dinner then games and LOVED it. This time however, we came just to play games. 

First off, all of the bags boards were occupied so we decided to attempt shuffle board...well there was only one set of weights and they were apparently \"checked\" out to someone and there WEREN'T even playing so we were a little pissed that they didn't have an extra set ... we will talk bout extra sets in a minute. Then we asked about playing beer pong at an open table they said they don't do that there so we went and got paddles to play actual ping pong. It was hard as hell because you could barely see the ball whizzing at you with the dim lighting...fail. Last, once we finally saw an empty/ not used board for bags, I went and checked one set of bags out. I even had all of our bags set up and ready to play  when my friend got back from getting us more drinks...and they had checked another set of bags out to someone right after me and they tried to play 'teams' with the four of us...that made us pretty aggravated because WHY in the HELL would you check out more bags than you have boards to play on. Makes NO Sense. 

Overall, I used to recommend this place to people asking about something fun to do in Tempe but I don't think I can do that anymore."}
{"text":"This is definitely a great place as far as coming to hang out with family and friends. There is plenty of space to spread out, there's also an area that has corn hole and foosball tables to partake in. I was in a party of 11, we got there early, so we were seated immediately. Our waitress was great! She was patient took all our orders and brought everything promptly. The Brussels sprouts appetizer was great. The drinks, very tasty. Overall, food entrees were just okay. I had an egg white frittata that lacked flavor. My brother and dad had a breakfast burrito with house potatoes that was just okay. Id definitely return for a few drinks with friends and the hanging out. The food itself, I may hold off or try something else."}
{"text":"This place was a hidden gem! We went for happy hour and sat at the bar. It wasn't crowded, staff was friendly, and food was absolutely delicious! We ordered the happy hour bites ... Salmon bruschetta, antipasto, and chips w/ onion dip. The portions are definitely snack size but it's affordable to order several since it's the happy hour menu. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great service, awesome atmosphere!! However, Do NOT try the Fried fish.. Worst dish on the menu.. It was disgusting, i couldn't get past half of one... The server didn't offer to exchange it for anything else after I mentioned it didn't taste well, so i settled for the fries on the side!!"}
{"text":"First meal in Scottsdale - great food, service (ty Jamie) and chill vibe...

Beets n whipped goat cheese was lovely, Korean style Brussels sprouts were good - I needed to add a bit of salt to make them pop, and pleasantly surprised by the trout recommendation - tasty, caramelized onion, green beans, shaved almonds and sauce was very good"}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend in Tempe, AZ, and she had to work for the day, so I took a stroll to lunch by myself. This was only 6 or 7 blocks from her townhouse, so it was a perfect walk, and it was something we had not yet tried together. 

Since I was alone, I decided to sit at the bar. There were about 10 other people at the bar, and the bartender was understandably busy. However, when someone who sat down after me was greeted before me, I got a little frustrated. I stared down the bartender, and we made eye contact. He came over and apologized for the wait and brought me a glass of sauvignon blanc and the menus. 

They have a small plate menu that you can check the quantity of each item you want or write in what you want if it is not on there (entrees). It reminded me of a sushi restaurant. I asked him whether he liked the Kale and butternut squash salad or the Chicken gorgonzola salad better, and he recommended the Chicken gorgonzola salad, so I got that and the roasted brussel sprout small plate. 

The brussel sprouts were cold, but so cold I assume they are meant to be served that way. They were drizzled with balsamic vinegar, and they were delicious. The chicken gorgonzola salad was also very good. All of the unique flavors combined together very well. 

I loved the atmosphere. This place is huge! It would be interesting to see what it is like at night. I would definitely come back here if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Love the bar away from the Yard.  Not a fan of the Yard at least not at sunset when it is overrun with kids.  I'm sure its complexion changes quickly as it gets later in the evening.  El Matador drink is terrific.  But ordering cheese plate is ridiculous.  You order different cheeses for about $4 each but what you receive is the weakest, most pathetic single thin slice.  So 4 stars as a place to drink, 2 stars for food which is how I arrive at 3 stars.  I was going to give it 4 stars but went somewhere afterwards that had an amazing kick-ass meet & cheese spread for $8."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. 
Love the urban eclectic atmosphere. 
Great food. 
I had the chef's tomato saffron soup with a cheap house salad. Very, very good. 
My daughter had their signature burger with a house salad. Great. 
Our waiter (wish I remembered his name) was fabulous. 
Can't wait to go back. 
A lot of restaurants could take a lesson from this place. Good food, good atmosphere, GREAT service."}
{"text":"Good cocktails, good food, one less star because the service was super sweet and nice BUT slow. Even still I would definitely go back... the service just gave us more time to visit and talk."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant today and it fantastic.  Our server, Lorna B was so nice and sweet. She gave us recommendations on food choices and everything was delicious!
We are locals and will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Great places for large parties, food is always a solid 9. The big game area is fun for all ages after dinner or while you wait!"}
{"text":"This is reviewing this CD against the one in Scottsdale. The one in Scottsdale is a fantastic experience for both food and service, see that review. This one was a totally different and disappointing experience. Bartender, young guy with a fancy fedora, was using his time plastered to one waitress in particular. Had to waive down other servers to order, get a glass of water or pay. Then they would go tell him and he would come over like nothing was wrong. Like he had been there for us our whole lives, our best friend, named his first child after us.... too cloying! You can't make up bad service by being so condescending. We're not that stupid."}
{"text":"Love it, love it! Sat at the bar and the bartenders gave us a fantastic experience. The place was rocking, but their service and the food were perfection. They flowed back and forth down the bar, like a well choreographed dance. Menu guidance was right on, questions were answered in valuable detail, orders were taken promptly and food arrived hot and delicious. 
BTW - send the bartenders from the Tempe one here for OJT. 180 degrees different in how they treat customers."}
{"text":"The food was good, would not order the ribs, the meat was tough, did not fall of the bone.  The fried chicken was tasty along with the chopped salad.

When it is hot out stay away from sitting by the door.  The flies were bad, asked to close the front door, they did for 5 minutes then they opened it back up and the flies were back!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and that was probably the wrong thing to do. Being a trendy joint, I thought it would be awesome to try this place out. I should have known something was up because Mr Lucky's next door had a longer line then this place. 

I ordered the Bistro steak medium but it came out well done and my steak was luke warm along with my fries. The food also took FOREVER to come out. From the looks of it I think the reason it took a long time for my dish was because it was just sitting around getting cold. From the time we sat down to finally paying our bill, it took almost two hours. I also ordered the bacon Bloody Mary which was a little spicy for my taste, and that drink finally arrived to me about 20 mins later. 

1 star for the friendly staff
1 star for the turkey pastrami hubby ordered who said it was yummy. 

-1 for the extremely long wait for our food and drink
-2 for the food"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is secondary to the insufferable noise level.
On a Friday evening we asked to be seated where we could converse.  That meant nowhere indoors.  We were seated outdoors, but with their open-to-the-outdoors layout, it really didn't matter.  We asked several different staffers to turn down the music volume.  They all responded with a well-rehearsed statement (having been asked before) that they have no control over the extremely high noise volume of both the recorded and live music.

The food:  nothing special, and certainly didn't warrant putting up with throbbing eardrums.   The smoked chicken salad was formulaic:  a portion of greens, a portion of chicken, a portion of nuts, etc.  Not inspiring.   The ribs were reasonably delicious.  Substitutions for fries were made cheerfully.
 
The service:  high school level - well-intending but naive, with requests made repeatedly.

In sum, go here if you don't have much to say to your companion because the noise level won't allow you to be heard anyway."}
{"text":"Bill Dutcher on the first Saturday of every month is tough to beat. Great location, great food, great drinks, great music. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Great for large groups. They have first come, first serve seating in the back in the area called \"the coop\". Only difference is that there is a slightly more limited beer selection, but the full menu is still available. The place is huge and has really unique seating options, including banquet tables and large square seating arrangements around a fire pit. The game area is great and the visibility into the kitchen is really cool too. I ordered the grilled salmon with veggies. I'm trying to be mindful of what I eat so I ordered something on the healthier side. It didn't matter though- everything was delicious and didn't compromise on flavor, regardless of the fact that there are obviously more decadent items on the menu (36 your ribs????). A must try for Phoenix."}
{"text":"Met a couple friends here for happy hour - I can't speak to the regular menu, just the happy hour offerings.

For round one, (the two gals)  we ordered the fries - $6, the antipasti for one(chef's choice)  - $7, and two of the grilled cheese sliders at $2.50 each.

Service was prompt and all the food was very tasty.  
I knew about the bacon on the grilled cheese, but not the tomato.  I am not a fan of hot tomato, so I would have asked them to hold it had I known...but that's preference, not quality related.  The bread, chesse and bacon were just right...and I could have made a meal of these alone.
The fries are thin cut, fresh and very nicely seasoned.  Everything you could want in a fry - and generous basket of them provided!
The antipasti platter was my favorite.  Choice today was brie, sopressata, almonds and roasted tomato.  The bread served with it was perfect...crusty on the outside and heavenly pillow within.

Round two (the man joined us after he got off work), we ordered three additional grilled cheese sliders, the crispy shrimp and the chicken tenders ($5 each.)  I ordered the red wine cooler ($4 happy hour special, available in red, white and pink.)  As the server suggested - it was cool and refreshing with blackberry flavor.
Loved the shrimp...similar to popcorn shrimp but perfectly exectued.  Hot and crispy outside, tender inside and lots of flavor.  
Was let down by the chicken tenders.  Nothing wrong with them, per se...but everything else was so well done, the plainness of the chicken really stood out.
Will definitely be back for happy hour...and as my bank account grows, I'll look forward to working my way down the very cool drink list!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix just for an afternoon and we decided to become here because one of my friends loves it. We had a really good experience. The atmosphere inside is very trendy and cool. We ordered the pretzel and fondue for an appetizer which everyone enjoyed. For my meal, I ordered the grilled chicken club. The chicken was flavored really well. It also comes with ham on it. I'm not a huge ham fan but it's a nice addition to a club sandwich in addition to bacon.

Another cool thing is that our back there is a patio where you can play things like ping pong and corn hole. You just have to give an ID to the hostess and it's so easy to get the equipment. It was pretty empty outside when we came on a Thursday afternoon so we were able to play ping pong for a while which was fun."}
{"text":"Shared the pretzel fondue, normally something I wouldn't touch but they are perfectly crisp on the outside with a freshly baked doughy center and the fondue is creamy, de andante but not too heavy. 
The salads were fresh and dressed perfectly, not drenched, allowing you to taste the fresh and balanced toppings. Definitely try the Italian chopped for a savory blend. 
The meatloaf is a comfort food made with quality ingredients and full of flavor. A little more upscale than grandma makes it but not lacking the true American spirit of meatloaf.
Turkey pastrami is hard to find and they clearly get it right here both on the sandwich and the salads. The charcuterie is a must, they do not lack in quality on the meats or cheeses.
Drinks are unique, well balanced and refreshing. I recommend trying one of their house cocktails topped with beer or champagne. 

Service was better than average, the staff isn't overly friendly but they get the job done."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Servers wear what they want, which I think leads to a relaxed experience.  Menu was explained well, drinks were awesome, Felecia even suggested we take our last drink \"to go\" so we could get in line for the show- and, no, I don't think she was trying to free up a table or get rid of us,...great idea, we needed to get in that line!  ANYWAY, food was great, fun, just the right mix of fancy and casual, great flavors, and not heavy.  Fun sitting outside and watching people at the pool- comfortable atmosphere, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Their grilled cheese sliders were delicious!! They were the perfect portion, and even the side salad was good. I'm not a huge bacon person, but it was amazing on these little sliders! 

A friend also ordered the pretzel bites with provolone fondue, and there's a good reason these are so highly recommended! 

Overall I would definitely come back to this place. It's the perfect spot to come and chill for a drink and share a couple appetizers with some friends!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and overall vibe of this location. The chicken coop is super charming with lots of fun games. However, I came with a party of 12, so the server was shown a lot of grace. But we did wait tremendous amounts of time in between appetizer meal and dessert. Also, 4/12 of us got the teas berry and kale salad with chicken. However 2/4 actually received chicken and 0/4 got the menu promised avocados on top. So pretty turned off by that. A decent but lengthy experience."}
{"text":"This place gets pretty crowded with youngsters playing games from time to time but a fun place to hang out. The pork belly nachos were the best nachos I have every tried, and there have been many."}
{"text":"This has got to be the coolest restaurant I have ever been to. I saw it on Yelp and was on a Business trip. Funny enough a coworker suggested dinner there. 

Its a large open air restaurant with yard games and such. Really cool atmosphere. In fact IF the food had sucked...which it didn't they would have still gotten 3 or 4 stars. 

We had a bunch of small plates to share. Pretzels were awesome! Deviled eggs were good. Perogies were good. The pimento cheese...not exactly my southern grandmas recipe but it was ok. My only complaint, the \"cracklins\" weren't cracklins they were pork rinds. Little different. 

But it was an awesome experience, lively and fun! Def stop by if you are in the area, but this was worth a drive in my book."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe, great food and drinks, fast service, really fun atmosphere. This is the place to be if you're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout/The Yard is an amazing spot. Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere. Plenty of space, full of games and fire pits. I usually enjoy the fish and chips with a nice fresh squeezed IPA by Deschutes. 

However, one thing to warn you about. Went there the other day and bought two drinks for a friend and myself. The total for both the drinks was $20 after the tip. My card was charged $25 for whatever reason. Called to have it fixed to no avail. $5 is definitely not a big deal at all, but my only concern returning here going forward is getting overcharged again. This place is great besides that one little flaw."}
{"text":"Trendy and overpriced.  The staff, and overall look of the furniture and fixtures make this a very hipster hangout restaurant.  I tried the Korean Style Ribeye Cap which was touted as one of their signature dishes.  I expected something marbled with fat and as tasteful as a cut of wagyu beef and I was sorely disappointed.  It was not that much meat and didn't come with any sides.  I had to add a desert just to fill me up."}
{"text":"Let me just say that if I lived ANYWHERE NEAR Scottsdale, I'd eat here several times a week. I've eaten here twice and loved it both times. The food is amazing and creative and the staff is fun and efficient. The mozzarella and heirloom tomato salad was perfect and the seared tuna salad was a mix of amazing flavors. I had to stop myself from licking the bowl. 
I work in Scottsdale a few times a year for less than 24 hours at a time, but I'll be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I just demolished the Pub Burger, fries and a diet coke for lunch. Without question, THEE FINEST burger known to mankind. 

My new friends from Calgary joined me..."}
{"text":"When we walked in we were greeted by the lovely staff and were treated like royalty. Matt and Madison were lovely at the bar and so attentive; they served us so super good!"}
{"text":"In the Hard Rock, this was an easy walk from the Embassy Suites. They have indoor, outdoor, and seating in between. The menu at lunch has sandwiches, salads, and other meals. I had a bowl of chilli and a side of their house made potato chips. Eh, i didn't care for either one.  Service was good, food a bit slow."}
{"text":"We brought our one year old, sat outside, and received amazing food and great service--really like this place!"}
{"text":"The only reason this is four and not five stars is for the prices. Besides that, this place is awesome. Cool vibes, young crowd, and a fun hang out place. I had Jameson on the rocks and it was over $11 which sucked, but the place was so cool it made the prices worth it. I started out with the pretzels and cheese. OMG. Forgive my basic white girl terminology but that stuff is freaking amazing. I mean, last meal on Earth would definitely include those pretzels. I think they were $13, but it comes with plenty of pretzels and plenty of sauce and if you're looking for a foodgasm you get that too. I mean, I would be cool just eating that for dinner. But I was chillin watching sports so I ended up staying a while and god hungry again. Went for the Korean BBQ flavored ribeye. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT FOODGASM. I swear to god that was the best piece of steak I've had in my life. So much flavor. Perfectly prepared. Paired with the most delicious vegetables. I've eaten at a lot of bougie (sp?) places with ridiculously priced menus and gotten Kobe beef or filet mignon. I'd pick this piece of steak over any of that any day. Best $26 I've spent on food in a very long time. Ball out and get it. YOLO."}
{"text":"I hardly ever give five star reviews. My experience at Culinary Dropout today prompted me to do so. The reason we checked this place out was because I had a 25% coupon from Fox RC for Labor Day. First things first: The employees are extremely good looking. There is lots of tattoos and bare skin. Our bartender was awesome. He answered all our dumb questions with a smile and made some killer drinks. I had the Bacon Infused Bloody Mary and my friend had the Acai Mojito. I will be going back again to have that Bloody Mary. It was SO good. We started out with the homemade chips and onion dip and it was delicious. We pretty much filled up on those before we got our meals. I ordered the Havarti Burger, my roommate got the chef salad, and my other friend got the canneloni. Everything was super good, but it was too much food! My burger melted in my mouth and I kept stealing bites of my friend's salad. So, in a nutshell:

- Great vibe.
- Great food.
- Great drinks.
- Hot employees.
- Clever menu titles/
- Great experience!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  It has quickly grown to be one of my fav's!  Great ambiance, great food, great service!  It is the first place I take guests visiting AZ."}
{"text":"Only visited for lunch with business associates but we had a lovely meal both times.  

The pretzels and provolone fondue appetizer are a MUST order.  The portion is huge, so definitely need to share.  It was so good, we ordered it again the next time we visited!  

On our first visit, I had fried chicken and one of my companions had the trout.  The chicken was hot and tasty and the buttermilk biscuit was delicious, but the mashed potatoes were just OK.  My friend loved the trout so much she ordered it at our second outing!  I had the prime rib dip and fries on the second visit.  No fat on the beef and roll was nice, fries were good.  I enjoyed the sandwich, but the chicken was better.

Atmosphere is a bit loud at lunch but not unreasonable.  Seems to get crowded - we had a reservation our first visit (and had about a 5-10 min wait for noon on a Friday) and no reservation on the second visit (no wait, but it was a Wednesday).  I would guess it gets pretty loud evenings.  We ate in the main dining area, not the Yard.  Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Came in mostly based on the name, as it is a great one. The decor and feel were really cool, and our server was very friendly and accommodating. I had a burger with bacon and cheese. The burger was very good and the fries were as well. They had some happy hour deals, and I got a beer on tap. I came in around 4, so it wasn't too busy, but I look forward to coming in again at night time and checking out some of their other drinks and food."}
{"text":"Excellent service with great food and drink selections. Came for lunch today with my wife, she had the French dip and side salad and I had the turkey pastrami. The sandwiches were great, but the fries and side salad put it over the top. Best salad I have had in a while. Recommend the atmosphere for lunch or dinner outing with friends."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend. The restaurant has not atmosphere and is cool and trendy. I had the burger with havarti cheese and bacon - Delish! The burger was moist and juicy and the bread it came on was so fresh and tasty. I also had the grilled asparagus, but did not really like it served cold, so next time may ask that they heat it up. All in all, it is a must try."}
{"text":"Been there for a Sunday night dinner. Nice atmosphere, good service ok food. 
I'm not that impressed by the food. I think the presentation is awesome, the meal is ok  and the prices are high.
We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to review this place for years.  My heart literally hurts because I'm not near this place anymore.  I can honestly say this is a top 5 dining experience in my life.  Aside from the hostess that I fell in love with and still see in my dreams (the girl with the something tattoo), the food, service, and ambiance were out of my wettest dreams.  The music went from \"straight outta compton\" to foo fighters to muddy waters, and I loved it.  

We had a group of about 8 and over half of the people there weren't foodie-ish like my friend and me.  By the end of the night everyone had found a new or unknown love of food.  We ended up going through about 90% of the menu, ordering all their meats and cheeses, each entree, a few appetizers and finished with too much alcohol, almost to the point that it blurred out how good the food was.  Have been back on numerous occasions since that first night and this is one of TWO restaurants where I'm ok with going in and telling the waiter to \"order whatever you think is good\" and never look at the menu.  Seriously, that's how I order there. 

Three years later of ordering this way and I haven't had a moment of regret yet, except that I'm not able to eat more."}
{"text":"I really liked the vibe of this place. Very cool decor, industrial and modern/hip/chic. I ordered the egg white and chicken Fritatta. Ta-da! chicken and eggs. Yes, psychological but -- tasty :)"}
{"text":"So my first visit to the Phx location a few years back wasn't so great. But I thought I'd give this location another shot considering Fox restaurants usually have favorable reviews. So I was trying to book a party of 14 on a Saturday evening and called around all over the valley. I was denied several times (Thirsty Lion was incredibly rude on top of it. Uggg.) until I called Culinary Dropout. The hostess on the phone was great to work with and they were very accommodating with my party's size. Thankfully majority of my party arrived on time (we were here on 3/25/17). The food was great! We really enjoyed the soft pretzels and cheese and the pork belly nachos were amazing. Nobody in my party complained about their food and the prices were what we expected. So I'm dropping a star because of our server Megan. She did take our order and got our food delivered to us with no issues. The problem was she wanted nothing to do with us. We tried to make her laugh and we thanked her many times over. But never once did she make us feel welcome. Not one smile and super uptight. Everyone at our table kept saying \"what's her deal?\". It was a real downer to have her as our server other than getting our order right (btw ... I was a food server for many years back in the day and no stranger to customer service). But we did have a blast in the patio area playing cornhole. You just need to drop your ID off at the host stand for the bags. So thank you Culinary Dropout for taking us in, for the yummy food and for making it a fun night to celebrate. Please do me a favor and reevaluate your server staff."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place while walking around the area of Scottsdale! Loved the decor and outdoor/indoor seating.

Good place for a group of friends!  Our waiter was super awesome.  Gave a few suggestions.  We started w the pretzel fondue and it was hugeeeeee.  It was only my mom and I and we could only eat  a few.  She also loved the soup of the day but I loved the honey fried chicken!!!!! 

TRY IT TRY IT TRY IT.  You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Great gastro-pub in The Hard Rock Casino. We sat around a fire pit out on their patio and had some drinks before ordering a late dinner. Make sure and try their house made take on Fireball. Not as sweet and finishes with a little habanero. We had some very good Parma Prosciutto with crusty bread,Brussel sprouts and deviled eggs for apps and all were top knotch. Main course for me was the chefs take on Ramon with crispy pork belly and soft eggs. It was amazing! The broth is a mixture of beef,pork and chicken with a touch of miso. Was perfect sitting outside on a cool Vegas evening."}
{"text":"First time going to this location and we were so not impressed! We were told it would be an 1.15 min wait for a 4 people. They have open seating in the back that after 20 mins were able to sit and get served. At first the service was great! Got our drinks and orders taken very quickly. Then had to wait 40 min for food to come out! Our waitress totally forgot about us! She never can back to refill drinks and we had to flag down another server to get refills. 
The food was ok. I got the hummus appetizer and it was good. Just not very much for 12 $$ price. 
My husband got the broccoli cheddar cannelloni. The cannelloni itself was very good! But it came with 3 big pieces of broccoli on top that were burnt to a crisp! They literally were disintegrating. We asked waiter if that's how they were supposed to be and he said they were supposed to be \"charred\". They were in no way edible. Our friends got the same dish and there's was exactally the same. 
After this experience we will most likely not be going back! At least not to this location. Nothing is worse than bad service and burnt food!"}
{"text":"More like Culinary dropped the ball. We went here for some easy pre-going out food since we were staying at the Hard Rock and I was not so impressed. 

I came in with high expectations because it seemed like a super cool atmosphere with fire pits and good lighting but left annoyed and unsatisfied. 

First, they wanted to sit us at some chairs outside that didn't have a table where \"most guests just put their plates on their lap\" I'm sorry but I'm not paying money to have a glorified picnic. 

When we did get a table our waiter took foreverrrrr and he was not accommodating to vegetarians AT ALL. Usually restaurants have several options (not just one salad) seeing as people have dietary restrictions. I would have been happy with regular pasta with marina sauce but no. 

When we finally got the food, it was luke warm and again, disappointing. When we tried to get our bill, we had to find another waitress because our waiter was MIA. Like I understand it's busy but don't neglect your customers all together."}
{"text":"This was an awesome experience! Being new to Scottsdale my wife and I made this our first destination.

The service is quick, knowledgeable and witty.

We had periegonie and pork belly nachos. UNREAL! Yum yum yum!!!

The decor is sort of modern meets Middle Ages.

Super cool place, try sitting at the outdoor bar so you can watch the bar making action as well as the kitchen on the far interior.

Very fun."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! We came here for lunch in between business meetings and it seemed like everyone else here was doing the same. The entire restaurant had this open air feeling with some great decor. We had the homemade potato chips with French onion dip- one of the best dips I've ever had! As my entree I had the kale salad with smoke salmon- the lemon tahini dressing was amazing. One of my coworkers ordered the green chili stew and the other order the cheddar and potato pierogies. No one had a complaint especially with the French onion dip."}
{"text":"New Year's Day, roll in with a reservation at 1900 hrs. super excited only to be let down from there. We place a drink order, drinks don't come, waiter comes back, we order appetizers. Appetizers come out, zero drinks have yet to make it to the table ( Bar isn't full) then the appetizers come and we wait another 5 minutes for water and another 15 for beers in total 30 minutes to get a drink. Water  should be served if the kitchen or bar is behind, we eat the cold appetizers and leave to the Thirsty Lion across the street and have excellent service. Gladly will share my experience and disappointment. Email me charleslanoue@ymail.com"}
{"text":"MYO cheese plate was so fun! Great drink selection... had sour beer and Moscow mules."}
{"text":"Great time at this restaurant! Very crowded on a Friday night. We were luck to find a bar seat on the patio and got served quickly. The bartenders were busy as can be but still gave us just the right amount of attention. 

We ordered the antipasti plate ... it was perfect! 

I also tried my hand at the Bacon Bloody Mary ... I can't stop talking about it. HUGE FAN."}
{"text":"Tuna salad, iced tea on a Tuesday in Phoenix. Guess what ? Culinary Dropout is in PHX. 

HAPPY !!"}
{"text":"Too busy for their own good. Impossible to get a drink at the bar even though there appear to be three bartenders working.  Won't survive long like this."}
{"text":"I've only had appetizers while hanging out of the Yard. But the two I had where AMAZING! Best wings I've ever had, the Thai Chile Chicken Wings! Thai is typically a little spicy, however these have a perfect combination of sweet and spicy! You have to try them! Also try the roasted garlic hummus. Great flavoring and generous portions!"}
{"text":"I have always loved culinary and I brought my dad here a few weeks ago for dinner. Although our server was new he was knowledgeable and went out of his way to accommodate me and my vegan lifestyle. I wish I remembered his name because it was the way service I have ever had here! The chef happily cooked me up an amazing vegan dish that was not on the menu. The staff was friendly and made this lifestyle transition for me even easier. Thanks culinary dropout!"}
{"text":"This place has the looks, vibe and scene of a typical hipster restaurant you'd find in uptown Colorado. But the food is ridiculously below par. I ordered the Kale Salad and it was suppose to come with sweet potatoes and they left them out. I asked for avocado and they put two small pieces. 

My buddy has the steak tacos and he wasn't impressed at all. Everything is so over priced. I'd come here for a drink and that's it. 

Think of the food as generic Red Robin."}
{"text":"Celebrating my husband's birthday at a very wonderful, unusual, urban place.  I really wanted to give it a 41/2 but will wait for the next visit and pretty sure it would get 5 stars.  Atmosphere & ambience is very cool...outdoor ping pong tables, shuffleboard, fire pits outside or sit inside and you still get the same flavor.  Great waiter, helpful, attentive.  But most of all, GREAT menu.  We started with their antipasto board with an array of choices...meats, cheeses, hardboiled eggs, roasted aspargus, beets.  What a great way to start.  The bistro steak on a bed of melted gorgonzola was mouth-watering.  And hot carmel monkey bread with apple filling and vanilla bean ice cream, on the house, to end the birthday celebration.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went to Culinary Dropout with my hubby tonight.  We just missed their happy hour which ends at 6pm but we did enjoyed a nice dinner there.  We shared the pretzel fondue which was simply delicious.  We found out that they make their own pretzel bread daily.  The pretzel bread is soft and has a right amount of saltiness.  The cheese fondue is perfectly match with the pretzel bread.  
We really loved the atmosphere as well.  Their style is like a gastropub (a modern house which specialize in serving high quality food) in Europe with a splash of Southern Mix.  We appreciated the chef really focus on the food freshness and quality.  Plus it definitely a great place for happy hour, dinner, and watching a game.  They have live music on Friday night and Saturday."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo yummy!! The pretzel and cheese for an app is amazing!!! The pretzel pastrami sandwich is to die for! Follow it up with the salted carmel dessert and you are good to go! Ask for Hayden! She is the best and cutest server there by far!!! You will not be dissapointed in this pick!"}
{"text":"I had the green chili stew with a fried egg on top. It was good and spicy. The two pieces of corn bread were a nice touch. The pretzels with the fondue were really good.  Louder environment with open airy space."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food that's VERY reasonably priced and a very fun environment! Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"so a girl i know works here and after a discussion in mexico about why i don't like fox concepts, she convinced me to come and give it a try. 

so she sent me a message the following week telling me she was working the lunch shift and i headed in. 

she was so sweet and brought us a free pretzel app. my lunch date and i were both trying to eat healthy but felt bad not eating it. so what were we to do? 

wrap the pretzels in a napkin, shove them in my purse, and feed them to the guys at work of course! 

our food came out and it was pretty decent. the price was fair and of course you can expect it to be darling bc that's what fox does best. 

i'd be willing to go back! the service was friendly from all the staff, not just my friend :) 

a- ok!"}
{"text":"I went out to Culinary Dropout last night for dinner and the food and server were great!! The Garden Kale salad was awesome and the hummus was good too. My server also did a great job there. His name was Jon Jon, he was super cool and made my experience at the restaurant really enjoyable for me and my date!! Thanks again Jon Jon!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. Fresh prepared and unique menu options. Gorgonzola chicken salad was very tangy and delicious--not too much mayo-- and the service size was right.
Don't miss the fresh potato chips with onion dip, either.
Place is casual, including staff, so don't come here expecting the snob treatment (vegas has PLENTY of other options for that!) our server Felicia was friendly & fun and got out out to our concert on time-- all with a smile."}
{"text":"Problem with our reservation but the manager went above and beyond to make our experience a positive one. Great cover band tonight (Nick and Taylor), delicious food as always, and awesome bartenders. Love this place!"}
{"text":"After searching a few websites I kept seeing this place come up.  Figured what the heck and made reservations. Trust me, on a weekend make reservations.

For starters we got the salami, dulce gorgonzola, and crusty bread.  Salami was OK, shaved thin, not my cup of tea but good.  The cheese, take it slow if you get the gorgonzola, it packs a punch.  In the good way.  Crusty bread was perfectly toasted, nice and crisp with a good center.  Light garlic oil and balsamic on top went well.

My wife got the kale and butternut squash salad.  She said it was wonderful and the one bite of kale she convinced me to eat was not bad.

I got the fried chicken.  I never thought I would find some of the best fried chicken outside of the south.  The outside was a little greasy but when I bit in!!! Great breading and perfect on the inside. Mashed potatoes were mashed potatoes,  in other words, good.  Slaw was light and crisp, thinly sliced, making it one of the few slaws I have not instantly hated.

Service was ok.  The place is super busy.  Nice staff but not super attentive due to the vast amount of people.  It is very loud inside so you may have some communication issues with the server.  Not a place for a quite date"}
{"text":"Loved our lunch here. Fun and comfortable ambiance. Delicious food that appeals to all different tastes. Drinks were well made, too. Parking was a bit difficult to find given that it was in the middle of the holiday, but we thankfully got a spot so we could enjoy the restaurant! We can't wait to return again soon!"}
{"text":"SUCH amazing food and great service and the atmoshpere was so beatiful and calm! I will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"While visiting Arizona, my friends told me that we HAD to go to Culinary Dropout. Two steps into the restaurant and I understood why - this place is gorgeous!

We don't see ever see this huge of restaurants in the Bay Area due to space restrictions. Culinary Dropout was really big and airy with a variety of seating spread throughout (bar, regular tables, table tops, etc.) Didn't feel claustrophobic at all, but rather, very relaxed!

[FOOD]
~ Korean-style Brussels Sprouts: Perfection. Crispy with a delicious spicy/sweet flavor. I would eat this every damn day if I could.
~ Pretzels & Fondue: My friends ordered this and let me try one. Don't think I could ask for pretzels to be cooked any better. The cheese wasn't as amazing (tasted a smidge like \"fake\" cheese), but that still didn't stop me from drowning my entire pretzel into the sauce.
~ Mussels: Great flavor, but very sandy which was a bit of an annoyance while eating.
~ Beer in a bag: For around $2, you get a surprise can of beer that is not on the menu. Such a cute and cheeky idea, so of course I had to give it a whirl. Ended up getting a random beer that I've never seen before, and by no means was it amazing - but hey, it was a nice way to wash down my pretzels and an overall fun idea.

[SERVICE]: Our server was super friendly and definitely added to our enjoyable experience. The only minor comment I have to make is that our table ordered 2 portions of the Pretzels & Fondue. Only one came out first while the second took another 5-10 minutes. It was awkward considering these orders were not meant to be shared with the entire table, but to the specific people that ordered them. Not sure why they couldn't have just waited to bring the first one out at the same time as the second one.

All in all, I loved Culinary Dropout. From the wonderful ambiance, to the quirky menu and food - I'm sold!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations coming to Culinary Dropout. I go to school in Phoenix and have eaten at several of the other restaurants by Fox RC. I don't think they have a restaurant that I haven't loved, and Culinary Dropout was no exception. Our server, Elliot was very attentive and it almost seemed like whenever I wanted something he was right there. The atmosphere was very cool. We sat on the patio outside and, despite being surrounded by a huge hotel, the lights and decorations created an intimate atmosphere. 

Since this was our first time at the restaurant, we asked Elliot to select some of his favorite items on the menu for us to share. He brought over mini grilled cheese sandwiches, roasted artichokes, soft pretzels with cheese dipping sauce, crispy bread with burrata cheese, pork ribs, and an ahi tuna salad. Everything was fantastic. I had a great time there and will definitely return on my next Vegas visit.

As you can see by my rating, this is place you should check out."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food. Great selection of local beers, gracious portions. Fun, young atmosphere. Upscale but not stuffy. We would love to return but was just there for a couple of nights. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!!! the food is awesome, the atmosphere is incredible, the staff is pleasant to look at and talk to. if you go here and don't enjoy yourself I would be shocked....."}
{"text":"First time culinary dropout. The four of us arrived at 7:30 on a Monday night (holiday) and it was 3/4 full. 

Between us we ordered a Mac burger, kale salad, grill cheese and a cheeseburger. I got the Mac Burger, which was interesting. 

I thought it would have some sort of baked Mac n cheese on it, since the menu was vague. It was called the Mac Burger cuz it was similar to a Big Mac: three layers of bun, thousand island dressing, you know the rest. 

Although it was a large, colorful and tasty burger, it was nearly impossible to eat. Picture your classic Big Mac, but about five inches in diameter, with lots of sloppy secret sauce. It kinda went everywhere. I switched to fork and knife but still couldn't get it right. 

My family was happy with their meals, so it could've been worse. I'll try CD again but with a different menu choice."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere pretty enjoyable! Empty on a Monday night, so service was fantastic and food was great, drinks soso. Opted to sit inside, but  there's ample open seating areas outside with a couple games! Great for large groups who just want finger food and dranks. 

Server was attentive and provided great recs. 

Pickled Sweet Peppers were mildy pickled, would've loved for it to be picklier, flavor was there though. Oysters were alright, would pass on this next time, but I rec the $3 white shrimp- just one to try though! 

Wanted to try the 36 hr pork ribs and Fried Chicken but they RAN OUT OF BOTH? Wha the fudge. So opted for the Roasted Salmon and Thai Chili Chicken Wings. Both were actually pretty tasty, can't imagine how them ribs or chicken would taste. 

I had the Pistols at Dawn drink with bourbon, ginger agave and a splash of red wine...interesting combo huh! Tasted almost like a whiskey smash bramble combo. Had a sip of the Old Fashioned...tasted a bit watered down..was a slight disappointment. 

If I am at Hard Rock again, I'd come back!"}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome! Totally recommend this to all my friends and people coming in looking for a chill hangout atmosphere! Will definitely return soon! Can't beat $3 happy hour mugs (includes all beers)!! Woot woot!"}
{"text":"Great service from all and a really fun atmosphere. Honestly we came to play ping pong and enjoy a few drinks but decided to order dinner. I sampled the shaved prime rib dip sandwich that a friend ordered, it was very nice with perfectly rosey prime rib. I loved my pub burger and fries. Fries were hot, crispy and flavorful and my burger was one of the best I've had. Next time we go to the valley we know where we'll eat."}
{"text":"My mother, sister and I popped in for a Mother's Day brunch, and right away we loved the space.  They had tons of indoor seating, live music, and they even had seating close to the band!  We were able to snag those with a reservation, which was easily made online, and the serve staff were so nice.  

But the food yo.  The fooooood was so good.  I got a plain egg and cheese scramble with bacon and potatoes: hands down one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. This is legit my new birthday place."}
{"text":"Not bad. It was hit or miss depending on the dish. The fried chicken is a miss. Just not done properly from batter to the chicken. The green chili stew was very good and the pretzel balls with cheese were delicious.

Dinner
* Pretzel balls with cheese (Excellent)
* Chili stew (Good)
* Fried chicken (Ok)"}
{"text":"The bar tender was super nice and helpful with selecting a beer. Pretzel bits are amazing! Fun atmosphere I love this place"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with a Fox Concepts restaurant. At least this has been my experience so far. I met a client here for lunch. The location is HUGE, lots of meeting space and lots of seating.

Side note: when I walked in a guy was looking for his credit cards he lost the night before, he said he had \"too much fun\" there the night before...lol. I hope he found them.

Anyhow...you can make a reservation here and probably should. It does get busy. I had the salmon - amazing. My client had the meatlof - loved it. We shared the pretzel bites with cheese. OH EHM GEE. I wish I lived in Arizona so I could eat those more often. Those plus apple cider beer would just be heaven.

Ok maybe it's good I don't live in Arizona so I can't eat those all the time. Probably not good for the gut...

In any case, this place is a gem. Definitely check it out. It will suit all food preferences and your foodie friends too."}
{"text":"Yes, 4 stars for the reason you go to a restaurant: Food!
Quality was good.  Atmosphere was Trendy Scottsdale.  Love the name and well executed theme of the name throughout - menu, tables, decor, employee uniform etc.
Food was really tasty, Pretzel fondue hit the spot.  Monkey Bread was great, seasonings on the entrees were done with tasteful restraint.
Waitress was cute as a bug's ear, although she did forget part of our order; to her partial defense, the place was packed but I would have liked to try the forgotten appetizer.
The Death's Door adult beverage was a perfect concoction: I want a large pitcher with a long flexible straw . . . floor here I come!  But for $10 bucks it better be darn good.
I was not surprised to learn that this restaurant was part of the Fox Family of restaurants as my other experiences with them have all been top notch (Olive & Ivy, Bloom, Sauce).
Fun place, I will go back if nothing else to try more tasty food.
Final Rating: 4.3"}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I go in the bartenders, servers and managers are always so amazing and nice. They really make it a great experience. I always sit at the bar, but even the servers and managers come over to say hi to me. Food is great too! I've had everything from Mussels, to perogies, to sandwiches, to their antipasti. I have yet to be let down. Working in the service industry, it's good to find places to go that make you feel good and happy. Not a disappointment at all!! Love it!"}
{"text":"went here for brunch one sunday afternoon in the fall.  sat outside and it had a gorgeous view of the pool.  pretty good brunch menu and great ambiance.  the pretzel appetizer with the cheese is so yummy!"}
{"text":"NEVER COME TO VEGAS W/O EATING HERE. Wow factor food, prices and service.. Our server (Natalie) might have been the best, ever. Cool, unique place and the PATIO IS TO DIE FOR! Time and money well spent here, always."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Put our names in...and only had to wait about 30 min. Not too bad. The bar was a little too crowded to wait there, so we went a couple of doors down to pass our time.

On to dinner...we had a great server.  He was super friendly, nice and was vocal with his opinions.  I would love to tell you that all of his reccs were spot on...but they weren't.

We started with the pretzels and the cheese fondue. DELISH.  I went halfsies with my friend and we shared the prime rib sammie and the shrimp caesar salad.  The prime rib sammie was mediocre.  The beef wasn't flavored at all, and when we got the fries, they were cold.  Hot plate, cold food..not a good sign.

We did get fresh fries, I didn't finish my half, and moved on to the salad.  The salad was good, but not great.

All in all, I would go for a drink and some apps, but wouldn't really want to eat dinner here again.  I may have just ordered wrong...but two meh things do it for me."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent, but service is exemplary at this site.  It would be a disservice for them if I tried to describe how great they were.  The pretzels and fondue are always a delicious option and during happy hour prices are nothing short of incredible.  Very reasonable for high end food.  Definitely not your average pub food.  Ambiance is nice especially on the patio in November when the area is decorated for Christmas."}
{"text":"Kai was an amazing server. He recommended awesome drinks and food and everything was on point in his department. The kitchen on the other hand was kind of slow, our food was cd and took a long time to get to us but Kai made up for it. If you're eating there, you need to make sure he's your server. Other than that, my meal was good but would've been better hot."}
{"text":"Stopped for drinks and a snack here in between gambling and walking around. My dad did their brown bag special, which was a can of beer in a brown bag so you don't know what it is. It was something cheap, which made him laugh. He's no snob so he still drank it. I had their Riesling and my partner had the moscato, both were good. Did the pretzel bites with fondue and home made chips with french onion dip. Chips and dip were good, pretzels and fondue were amazing. I was surprised that they did provolone but it was excellent. Saw mussels, fried chicken and a few other things go out. All looked good. Ambiance is cool. Love Hard Rock, like this place too."}
{"text":"So, we walked past this place on the way back from Olive & Ivy and thought the name was interesting.  I couldn't remember Culinary Dropout and kept referring to it as the Shi**y Chef.  Wound up going in on a Tuesday night... missed happy hour, dang it.  It looked like Fangtasia from True Blood on the inside.  Velvet, black, chandeliers, etc.  Very dark inside.  Had to use my phone light to read the menu.  Lots of pretty people working.  Our server, Alyssa, was quick and efficient.  Talked super fast, but knew her stuff.  We had the smoked salmon and short rib pasta.  Both were excellent and served quickly.  Really like the pasta and wish I could replicate at home.  The prices weren't too bad, either.  I enjoyed my meal at the Shi**y Chef.

Pros=interesting concept, great food and service
Cons=seating is very close to other diners.  Had to sit near a woman (I think it was a woman) who was missing a lot of hair (not cancer-style, just pattern baldness, I think).  Distracting.  Parked at the mall and walked over."}
{"text":"I would say this place is solid but not outstanding. We made a reservation however when we arrived (about 1pm on a Friday) this place was empty. We were seated promptly and were quickly greeted by our server. We started off with the pretzel and cheese fondue (thanks yelpers!) which was the best part of the meal. I had fish and chips - they were soggy but had a decent taste. My husband had a club sandwich which was meaty, a large potion but just average in taste. Our server was pretty good just a tad slow at times. 

The vibe there was geared towards 20 something's which left us feeling a bit out of place. I felt I was too clean cut and clean to be here!!

We would probably not come out of our way to eat here again. Any of this food I could easily find on the strip. Then again, that pretzel shiz was pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in early this afternoon for my final lunch before heading to the airport, glad I did! Not only is the food great, but the morning bartender made the whole experience even more pleasant.  It's hard to find bartenders or servers that naturally have this and he sure did. Happy New Year to you guys, keep up the great work and I'll be definitely stopping by on my next visit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  A upbeat cool atmosphere with boho chic furnishings outside.  The menu is small but with enough to lure the varietal tastes of my party of 4. I had the roasted salmon and the compliment of quinoa, apples and jicama made this dish simply awesome.  Culinary Dropouts is my new favorite place."}
{"text":"This was the first meal we had when we arrived in Phoenix! Had Culinary Dropout for dinner and it was not crowded at all for a Saturday night out. Our waiter was exceptional. She answered all of our questions and even recommended a couple of drinks. They had live music that gave the restaurant a nice ambiance. They had a pretty standard menu and had something for everyone. Bottom line, culinary dropout is a safe bet if you have those who do not have an adventurous taste bud"}
{"text":"Came here after work for dinner with some friends.  I've been meaning to check out this place for quite some time because of all of it's raving reviews.

First and foremost, parking.  There's tons of parking space which is great! However, this place is seriously popular, especially after work around 5PM. Despite the relatively large parking space, almost all of the spots were taken -- my roommate and I got lucky and pulled in as someone was pulling out. I will note that there is complimentary valet though (bring cash, just in cash! Don't forget to tip!)

Now onto the interior. Gorgeous, gorgeous place. From the floors, to the walls, to the women's bathroom, to the relaxed (or absence of?)dress code for the staff... this place is so trendy and hip! I'm especially fond of the lights (they dim then around 6pm!). I'd definitely love to get a little dressed up and go here to grab some drinks with my friends. This is the perfect place for that.

The staff? The staff was great! Super accommodating and responsive. Constantly checking in on how our group was doing. Loved it.

Now for the appetizers. We had two appetizers: the pretzel and provolone fondue as well as the pork rib nachos. Both were fantastic and very easy to share. So much flavor and cheese! I love cheese. I'd love to try all of the other apps (I'm thinking the wings next time!)

As for the entrees, I ordered the Italian grinder with a cheap house salad on the side. The salad was awesome! It's presentation definitely did not match up with its name. Now, the Italian grinder looked quite delicious (I asked for lots of jalapeños in it!) but man.. it just wasn't good. I was pretty full from the apps so this may have contributed to it, but geez, I really couldn't bring myself to finish the sandwich. So I asked for a to-go box and decided to save it for tomorrow's lunch.

When I got home, I had a HORRIBLE stomach ache (I'll spare you the details). I told all my friends thinking that maybe the appetizers were the cause. Everyone else was fine, except for me. Perhaps I had something else to eat earlier on in the day that upset my stomach? So I gave the sandwich another shot.

NOPE NOPE NOPE. Eating the remainder of my sandwich ended up with the same results. I learned my lesson. I am never, ever going near the Italian grinder again. 

I didn't have the most positive first experience here... I will definitely go back to this place for some drinks and apps and MAYBE some of the other entrees but in all honesty, none of them really caught my eye -- which is how I ended up with the sandwich.

At the end of the day, this is the perfect place for some apps and drinks, but I don't think I'd ever come here for dinner. But who knows? Maybe next time I'll change my mind and work up the courage to give some of the other entrees a shot. Maybe I'll check out the location in Scottsdale or Phoenix. Until then, my stomach and I will definitely be avoiding the dining area at this location for the foreseeable future. If I ever go back, you can find me at the bar."}
{"text":"The pretzel fondue is my favorite thing.  Also the fried chicken was pretty good"}
{"text":"If you are in Tempe, this is a must eat. Very cool place and the food was outstanding. The chairs were stained and the complimentary valet (we didn't know until we were already in the parking lot) was too busy. Too many cars for only 2 valets. I had to get my car myself. If I could give it 4 1/2 stars I would."}
{"text":"5-stars for cool ambiance, 3-stars for undercooked chicken wings. We had a work dinner at Culinary Dropout which included a myriad of shared dishes and cocktails. I had my heart set on chicken wings which were unfortunately not cooked correctly. Kitchen mishaps happen, but of all the chicken joints in the world... why did it have to happen to mine? Other than the chicken wings dinner overall was a pleasant experience with the pretzel bites and cheese being my favorite dish! Will give it another try on my next visit to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is one of those places where the food is good, and I could have given it 4 - 4 1/2 stars but the service unfortunately is always a hit or miss. 

I always start with their meat and cheese plate which consists of some solid items. Some of the meats and cheeses are the same ones you can find in Arrogant Butcher (and AJs) which are delicious. For the cheese, my favorite is the prarie breeze (cheddar). I love getting the crusty bread with balsamic vinegar, and the prosciutto for the meats. I have had their chicken noodle soup before which I loved.

My friends and I come here often and when we do, our go-to is the house potato chips with onion dip. The onion dip is amazing! My sister likes getting the bbq pork belly nachos, and she likes to have the pork belly on the side. It's not amazing nachos, (The Vig has better nachos to be honest) but it's pretty decent. We have ordered the crispy shrimp caesar salad and it is tasty. The breaded, fried (?) crispy shrimp surprisingly pairs well with the salad. 

For entrees, I only ever get one thing - Culinary Dropout masters their fried chicken dish. I order it even when I am at home through Uber Eats or Postmates. The chicken is perfectly crispy with the right level of saltiness. The buttermilk biscuits are so good. I don't get anything else. I've had the meat loaf before which was not worth the $15. My boyfriend has ordered the korean style ribeye which he thought was just okay."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and our service was ok. We only ordered an appetizer, the pretzels with beer cheese, because we are on a search for the best pretzel/beer cheese. 

It was good but not \"the one\". Our server forgot about us couple of times so it took far too long to get a to/go box and the check. She was friendly, knowledgeable and bubbly, but forgetful."}
{"text":"I had been before for lunch a couple of times two years ago when I was in town for a conference and thought the food was really solid and the service was great.  So when I was coming back into town for a friend's bachelorette, I planned a dinner for the 9 of us here.  It was not the same place I remember.  First, when we arrived our table was unavailable, so we had to wait and eventually decided to take a table outside since they didn't know when one inside would open up (which I know is out of their control, but really set the tone for a below-par evening).  The hostess was very nice and apologetic, and told the bride-to-be as we were being seated that they'd send over some complimentary appetizers to make up for the wait and lack of indoor table.  Except those never came.  Then, half of the things people at the table tried to order they were out of.  And the waitress (who was probably slammed) forgot the drink my friend ordered.  Next, my friend ordered the bacon and parmesan grissini, which were literally the little skinny hard breadsticks that you get for free at many italian joints.  Like 4 of them.  For $3.  My friends and I ordered entree salads that were the same size as the house salad my other friend ordered, but for twice the cost.  And the food was pretty bland overall.  There was an amazing guitarist playing music inside but it was SO LOUD we couldn't even hear ourselves talk.  Big bummer, as I had really hoped it would be as good as I remembered."}
{"text":"What a great spot to hang on an NFL Sunday! Went here with some friends and had mimosas and delicious pork nachos (they were massive! enough for 2-3 people). Nice open air environment. They even put little NFL team pennants on the TVs so you know which games are or will be on each TV!"}
{"text":"I'm not planning to come back, but wouldn't say no if someone else wanted to go.

I've visited twice now with mixed experiences. I thought the food was as expected from a Fox restaurant. Not exactly to die for, but definitely better than a Chili's. My aversion to loving this spot is the menu prices and the extreme wait during a lunch \"hour\", and I use the term hour loosely there.

Had I not been out to lunch with my boss already, I would have likely had a stern \"talking to\" when I got back to the office two hours later. We had six people at our table and took about five or so minutes to peruse the menu. The staff was quick to deliver our drinks, but four salads, a burger, a meatloaf and 50 minutes later meant my lunch hour turned into a lunch two hour. I didn't exactly expect a ten minute turn around on our food; but really, almost an hour to deliver these dishes is seriously extreme. Even though my boss was with me, by the end of our lunch I was itching to get back to the office as to not waste any more time.

The burger I ordered was on the menu at $12, not exactly cheap to begin with. The waitress asked if I would like fries or a salad with it, but I asked if there was a vegetable I could have instead and she was happy to bring it out with asparagus. Regrettably, she failed to mention an added charge to make that swap from spuds to veg. My $12 burger, now $18 after fees, tax, and tip, is why I usually skip lunches during the week and bring in my own from home. :-(

I did; however, like the food itself, the company, the location, and the waitress was nice enough as well as apologetic about the long wait. I like the LARGE outdoor patio complete with shuffle board, corn hole, ping pong, and foosball. Seems like it could be a fun place to come for drinks in the evening hours with a couple of work buddies.

On my previous visit, I had the meatloaf, the meatloaf itself was good - and I did really enjoy the green beans, but not awesome and not really worth the price IMO, especially when adorn with what can only be described as fancy ketchup, really, ketchup on a $16 meatloaf (after tax-tip). Honestly, I feel the food on the menu is priced about 20% too high for most of the items. I wouldn't mind returning for happy hour, but outside of that, I'll likely just stick to \"grabbing a drink\" or two with friends if I'm ever back."}
{"text":"I love that Sam Fox has opened another Yard...this time in Tempe and on the light rail!  It is such a great concept, but it sure does get crowded!  We stopped in one night with friends and enjoyed some drinks, dinner and a lot of ping pong...what a blast!  The kitchen completely messed up our order, but rebounded quickly and made it right.  I would give this place 5 stars if it didn't get so crowded all of the time."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Stopped here for happy hour only to find out we had just missed it (apparently HH is over at 5 at the Tempe location) but we decided to sit anyways.  The place is very spacious, with a great variety of seating options.  It was a little loud, but much less loud than I was expecting considering the size and number of people there. 

We ordered the MAC burger, the fried brussels sprouts, and deviled eggs. The burger came out first and was so good!  Perfectly cooked and the toppings complimented it well- thousand island, white onion, lettuce, and pickle.  The portion of fries was generous, and our server was able to split the burger with no extra charge.  The sprouts had too much sauce, but were very flavorful otherwise.  I also really liked the deviled eggs, which was surprising!  They were seasoned well and had bacon, which gave them just the right amount of saltiness.  Our server kept our drinks filled and was very patient in explaining the menu.  Definitely will be back for HH!"}
{"text":"Sam Fox has some interesting restaurants, in my opinion this is without a doubt one of the weaker ones. 

I went with a group of people and we split two appetizers, the soft pretzels with fondue and the potato chips. These where actually pretty good, the only downside was that the server didn't inform us that the \"happy hour\" portion are some what smaller than the normal appetizers so that left us all a little put off. 

When the meals arrived everything seemed to be in order. I can't speak for the other people who I was eating with, but my pork belly sandwich could have been much better. It seemed very one dimensional and lacked any other flavors than ham and mustard. Had this included some sort of aioli or spread I think the dish would have been elevated to desirable instead of just wanting to put it down. 

Overall it wasn't a bad experience but it is not a place that I would recommend to a friend unless they only wanted pretzels and fondue lol."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place. A cool establishment, very trendy, with a scratch kitchen and  some quality crafted cocktails. The food was a bit underwhelming and pricey, but live music, the transformed warehouse, hip and friendly waiters and the overall experience was definitely 4/5 stars. You'll definitely drop a pretty penny here but I don;t think you'd leave disappointed since the overall experience at a place like this is hard not to enjoy. Fresh food, a large, visible kitchen and great selection of beer and cocktails. A cool place to bring a date or a friend to."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. I highly recommend the fried chicken. Service was a little slow but they make the food from scratch so we are fine with that."}
{"text":"First visit and my opinion is alright ( the decor makes it better than it is). A little pricey for what you get. The fish & chips looked really good but they gave you very little chips. C'mon be a little more generous! also our server didn't know how to explain the lager beer my husband asked about. That's horrible! I had the shrimp Caesar which I have had at the Scottsdale location. Not bad, but it's not a I wanna run back & eat that again dish. I am open to trying some of their dinner entrees but lunch could get pricey."}
{"text":"Let me start this off with saying this is more about the atrocious service and how downhill this place has gone. 

About a year ago I had some clients, or are restaurant venture capitalist back in NYC, in town and we stopped by CD for drinks and a casual dinner. Great time, they loved it, so we went back last Saturday.

Got there, drinks at the bar went perfect then we were sat, were all went downhill. Our waitress was this shorter blonder girl with longer hair, wish I had gotten her name to call her out. Took her 30 minutes to get us water and drinks, blamed it on the bartenders being all new, which is a lie because the bartenders had taken excellent care of us 20 minutes earlier. Spilt two of the cocktails all over us then proceeded to tell us they ran out of pretzels but if we wanted she could have them make it, 30 minutes after our order was placed. Did you run out of them or forgot to put it in? Instead of a beef barely soup she brought a beef stroganav, mind you she wrote this order down on paper twice because she said she lost the pad the first time. Burger with no cheese? Arrived with cheese. Then comes the bill at which point she tells us that we shouldn't worry she didn't charge us for the pretzels she never brought or the drinks she spilt on us. 

Then she left us with more words of wisdom, you should all come back on a Monday and Tuesday when it's slow and empty, Saturdays are too busy and we should expect everything to get screwed up.

Are you kidding me? I think they've started employing either complete trashy idiots or people who are drunk or high while on the job."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Amazing food and fair prices. Visited last Saturday night and thoroughly enjoyed the violin quartet. Ask for Sean he is an absolute doll and gives great service. Best waiter ever."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent food. The menu, service, and crowd are always great. One of my favorite casual dinner + drink places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not only is the food and atmosphere AMAZING, but I can't express how much I appreciated the service, care, and concern. Our friend got sick with a terrible migraine and had to leave. Our waitress and the Manager, Sam, got her a wet towel and bags, and called her a cab when Uber wouldn't take her. They were so quick and responsive and soooooo kind. If I lived here I would be a lifetime loyal customer! I feel like family already. Thank you so much!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband I came by for happy hour  .. we got sangria and the chips with French onion dip... definitely a good deal ... $4 per  generous glass of sangria which was delicious! And $4 for the chip app.. Would come back."}
{"text":"Bomb food! Plain and simple! The pretzel with fondue is sooooo yummy and I love the chicken and Gorgonzola salad! Plus it's central to old town, walking distance from the clubs or the mall- major bonus"}
{"text":"Amazzzzzzing service and food!!! You're an idiot if you don't eat here while in Vegas."}
{"text":"LITERALLY THE BEST FOOD I HAVE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! The fried chicken was INCREDIBLE! I never thought something as simple as fried chicken could be so life changing. I live in Colorado & my boyfriend & I often think of flying back just to eat here. My only complaint is that the music was WAYYYY too loud! We could hardly even hear each other speak & we sat on the complete other end of the restaurant. Music so loud like that can make for an unpleasant experience. However, our waiter was super cool, friendly & informative, drinks were well priced & again... THE FOOD ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a girlfriend of mine visiting from San Diego.  Got our Girl's Day Out started off right by choosing this place.  Walked in and were greeted by very friendly hostesses.  They seated the 2 of us at a table nearest the host stand which I was worried might be high traffic and annoying, but it was actually a great vantage point for people watching.
  
Our server came by and was very friendly and informative as this was our first visit.  We ordered a starter that was a \"build-your-own\" type of snack menu.  Ours was spreadable chorizo, herbed goat cheese & grilled crostini.  Nice flavors and perfect starter portion.  Entrees were the Sweet Corn Canneloni and the Roasted Salmon.  Both were DEE-licious!!  
All in all, great experience.  Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and the bartender Dylin was great. He made us some cool cocktails and helped us pick out our food. 5 star 5 star"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for dinners with some friends and once for lunch with a friend. I'd have to give it a third try for dinner but I definitely like the decor and found the food to be good. 

At dinner it was packed and we had to wait but not more than 15-20 minutes and had some drinks at the bar. I had the ricotta gnocchi which was delicious. The beer selection was great as well with beers I usually don't find elsewhere.

Lunch was great too. Decided to go a little lighter and had the smoked chicken salad. The waiter was kind enough to tell me there was mustard in the sauce, something I usually dislike, but decided to not change or ask for anything specific. Very good with pears,chicken, pistachios and gorgonzola cheese.

Only negative so far is the awkward seats inside. They seemed a little low and bulky for the tables, that's just me being nit picky though."}
{"text":"Well, here's a first. I'm still at the restaurant and leaving a review. THAT'S how much I like this place. First, the decor and atmosphere are just cool. You instantly feel more hip and fun once you cross the threshold. It feels expensive but casual. Put together but not trying to hard. 
For lunch, I had the grilled cheese sliders and fries. Once the server told me that everything was homemade, I knew a side of Ranch had to happen. Trust me...when things are homemade, you always get the Ranch. My meal was delicious. The bread was buttery but had a crunch that resulted  in crumbs all over me. The cheese was melty and delicious, and the tomato...well, it made me feel better about myself, I suppose. The fries were great and the Ranch...man, I could talk about it all day. 
My server, Janelle, was super busy but attentive and offered lots of suggestions. The only bad thing about this place is that I'm not here with my friends to enjoy it! Great place. Excited to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I wish I had given this restaurant 5 stars before this review. I apologize for not reviewing them for the many positive experiences I have had at this location before. Unfortunately, I feel there is no longer a management presence and the staff is completely allowed to do as they wish. I will no longer visit this location due to lack of hospitality. I used to like the laid back vibe of the staff, but it has turned into a slew of partially impaired \"hipsters\" who feel they are \"too cool\" to stop their banter amongst themselves to help the guests waiting to patiently pay for food and drinks.  I apologize in advance if valet parking and waiting for dinner makes me seem entitled. Like I said before, I previously liked the staff and experience, but recently felt like a number, not a guest. I wish the staff actually cared about my experience as much as I did when I drove there."}
{"text":"Came here for a conference at the Hard Rock hotel so just happened to stumble upon this and walked in. We wanted a quick step away from the conference so couldn't go far. This place seemed like a nice little place mainly because of all the open outdoor seating that overlooks the pool in the casino tower. 

Food was just okay. I ordered an ahi tuna salad which I thought would be nice pieces of ahi to dip with soy sauce wasabi along with a salad like the name says but what came was disappointing. The ahi was in many pieces and didn't seem super fresh actually. I ate half of the fish but the salad and dressing were pretty good. 

As a table we had the pretzel with cheese dip which was just okay and the deviled eggs which were super creamy and delicious."}
{"text":"We really like this place....strongly suggest the pretzel appetizer but beware it is rather large so plan on sharing. Nice atmosphere, good service. Usually it is hard to find a place we want to return to but we have been back to CD, it's that good! Hard Rock us a fun casino to walk through as well. Overall, good times."}
{"text":"We had the fried chicken, meatloaf and kale salad. The chicken was moist and juicy. Huge portion. Meatloaf was tasty and string  beans were crisp. Kale salad was ample. Lighting was too dim for me to really see the salad! Waitstaff was friendly and attentive. Food came within a reasonable amount of time. Music selections were awesome, good variety from the 60's and 70's.  Very cool atmosphere - decor, etc.  would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and big groups.  They can keep up with the numbers.  There are tons of staff to keep you and your friends happy and glasses full."}
{"text":"I had Fish & Chips, that was pretty good, service excellent and fast. Nice atmosphere, great for groups."}
{"text":"They've nailed it here.  The atmosphere was great.  The service was amazing.  It was super busy.  They had wait staff and service staff that were amazing.  Friendly, not annoying, purposeful.  It was a great experience.

The Food was amazing.  I had the fried chicken.  2nd best fried chicken I've had.  The deviled eggs were amazing as well.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The place looked pretty cool. They had a big outdoor seating area and the bar was split inside and out. This place is pretty hipster also. The host wasn't so friendly though. He had a little attitude. About the food, I ordered a Moscow mule, an IPA beer that was fruity, artichoke hearts dip, pretzels with cheese fondue and \"Soup from the day before.\" The artichoke hearts were pretty good. The presentation was good also, definitely not the average artichoke hearts. The pretzels with cheese fondue was pretty good. The pretzels were soft and the cheese was also delicious. Lastly, my soup was okay thought it could have had more chunks of veggies and seafood. Maquel our bartender was pretty awesome. She was very good about explaining the food and beers! This place is good for crowds and catching up because of the space and outdoor areas."}
{"text":"Consistency is critical, and difficult when there are so many factors needed to have a good experience dining out...but Culinary Dropout has never been a disappointment- food, service, decor, and ambiance! Love the antipasti create your own menu, its my favorite! Other items I have tried that have been amazing: House Potato Chips, Soft Pretzels, Onion soup, Roasted Chicken salad, Grilled Cheese Sliders. The deserts are so flipping good, the best being the Salted Caramel Custard. Not sure what happened to the Chocolate Cake, its the best in town and I miss it."}
{"text":"How could I forget to Yelp the Culinary Dropout? I was staying at the HRH with my brother Tom this past December, and we dined @ the CD twice. The first night (a Monday I believe), we were one of two tables eating dinner at around 6:00 p.m. The servers here wear \"regular/hipster\" clothes, and are very helpful with the menu. The very pretty blond server, complete with cutoff shorts, recommended the pretzel and cheese appetizer and fried chicken. Both being Foodies, we inhaled the appetizer. This is their signature dish and it doesn't disappoint. Tom got the fried chicken and I the Italian sandwich. Both were tasty and well prepared. I have the feeling from other Yelpers, that the menu is a can't miss on all dishes.
       The interior of the DC is modern. They have a square bar, a stage for bands, and an outdoor area with heat lamps. I recommend the bar if you are getting just an app and drinks. On our second visit, we got the pretzel app again an a few beers. They have a great beer selection on tap. We also sampled some Absinthe......wow. So, if near the HRH and hungry, take a chance on the Culinary Dropout. You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"This was a fun atmosphere. Big restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating + game area. The menu isn't overwhelming and the food was good. Ordered form the sandwich menu"}
{"text":"What's not to like about Culinary Dropout? The antipasto was not only phenomenal, but during happy hour is an incredible bargain. If you're into vodka, the Moscow Mule is a fantastic drink served in an old-school copper cup. The ribs were incredible and almost too much to handle for one person. I managed to finish them off though. Full menu at the bar, and the service was great. This is a very cool hang out."}
{"text":"Let me see, pretty much I'm really overwhelmed how diverse this place. In a good way. Live band-check, the lively crowd- check, games-check, food-amazing, the service-excellent. Three different businesses shared in one place. CuliNary dropout, The Yard and Little Cleo. The crowd mostly young professionals. A place where you wanna chill and hangout after work with your friends, and share foods and drinks. It's a must!!"}
{"text":"Great food- especially if you are into Italian meats & anti pasta dishes.  This is a fun place to go but the volume is loud so if you are wanting a quiet dinner spot- this isn't it.  If you want lively & fun, it's a good bet!"}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. Our server was bad. She hardly checked on us. She took a long time to take our drink order and food order. It was not a busy day. We went long periods until they refilled our waters."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Have never been disappointed. The atmosphere is super casual and has a cool hipster scratch kitchen vibe. Can't wait for one to appear in tucson! 

Their pretzel apitizer is amazing and their fired chicken and well worth the wait. I have not order a dish there that I was not more thab satisfied with and great prices!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The reviews on Yelp got me a little amped up and was about to forget about the fact that I'm about to spend $22 for a fried chicken dish. Others raved it was amazing and worth it. 

The hostess was great and seated us near the bar. We noticed it was incredibly hot in there and asked the staff if the air conditioning was on. Then I noticed the large sliding door behind the bar was open. Why would you have it open in June with it 95+ degrees outside. We were about to leave, but decided it would be worth it to stay.

Our server was the next bad part. He came right away with water but when we told him we were ready to order he told me he is only taking drink orders right now. We settled with just water. He came back 20 minutes later to finally take our food order. Again, we stayed because we knew it had to be worth it.

I ordered the fried chicken of course and my buddy ordered the stroganoff. Luckily it didn't take too long for the food to arrive though it wasn't fast either. I was starving by the time it arrived. I took a bite into the chicken and didn't really expect the honey glaze. It was alright, but just a little surprise. The chicken was cooked amazingly. The breast was very juicy and not dry at all. It did need some more seasoning though. It came with gravy so i guess you're supposed to dip it into it. The gravy was pretty bad. It tasted like it came in a paper pouch that you buy for $.50 at the grocery store.

The side dishes were not good. The cole slaw was soggy and lacked any flavor. Even with a ton of salt & pepper it didn't taste very good. The mashed potatoes tasted bland. What restaurant just serves mash potatoes with no seasonings or spices in it? Again, the gravy was bad. The biscuit though was really good. The honey crust on top was flavorful.

I wouldn't come back here. Everything on the menu was overly priced and sorry but the chicken was over hyped. Sure it was fried very nicely, but lacked spices."}
{"text":"Poor service, the server had far to large of a table and couldn't handle it. I waited for my food and after everyone with me had been served I still waited an additional 10 minuets before finally canceling my order.  The sever then replied oh, your food will be out soon if you Cancel I have to get my manager, 15 minutes later they brought my food out and I refused, the manager never showed up to the table either. I wasn't the only person at the table that didn't get food ordered. 

Word of advice don't feed the only pregnant person at the table LAST. Get help because you know you needed it. Don't make false statements. Finally, don't give paying customers an attitude."}
{"text":"Not knowing where to go for a casual brunch with family and friends, we ended up at The Yard and it turned out to be the perfect spot. The setting is just the right blend of chic and relaxed (wife's words, not mine), and the food was wonderful (our table had a frittata, turkey pastrami, kale and sweet corn salad, yogurt parfait, and a kids M&C - all to rave reviews). The highlight for us boys was the ping pong-foosball-shuffleboard mini-Olympics, while the live music was an unexpected added treat for everyone. And the service was as good as the atmosphere and food. We will be making this a regular weekend stop with the kids!"}
{"text":"Sat outside at bar.  Good for hanging and enjoying the people and the breeze.  Ahi salad and homemade chips are both very good.  Cool vibe."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. The service was great.  I liked the chopped salad I shared.  I also ordered the Pub burger.  It was okay- nothing great. I don't think I'll be rushing back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my parents. We had an antipasti plate with prosciutto, jamon iberico and manchego cheese - absolutely delicious! I could've eaten it for dinner! Instead, I had the chicken curry and it was wonderful as well, but not nearly as spicy as I would've liked. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here on two of my visits to Phoenix and I've been impressed both times. The food is really tasty and it comes from a unique menu, which I love! The drinks are also really creative. My only criticism is that they're a little pricey but they're really not THAT expensive. A lunch for two, including an appetizer and drinks, was around $60. Overall, both times were enjoyable experiences."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Review:

We had a nice time at the Culinary Dropout's HH this past Friday. We arrived around four-thirty and the inside bar was pack. The hostess said the HH was limited to the bar area inside and out. Nahhhh we thought, we'll stay inside thank you very much. It was 105 degrees and the outdoor water misters were totally ineffective 

I mentioned in passing that I had read about their HH on Yelp. After checking with her Manager, she came back and offered us one of the communal tables near the stage.

AMBIANCE/MOOD:
The crowd was a mixture of Millennium's and Gen X'er, along with an equal number of retires.  So eclectic? The interior had that old tin and aluminum stamped walls, reminiscent of the NY in the 1930s, with a large stage.  It also has several large B&W photos from the 1960s of Janis Joplin, The Who, Roy Orbison along with a very young Boss, creating some good Karma.

MENU:
All of the food is $6.00: Grilled cheese sliders; Chopped salad; yummy Korean beef on a stick (photos); Pretzels & Fondue; meatloaf sandwich; Smoked salmon bruschetta, Antipasti and much more.  All beers are $3.00 served in a 12oz mug; most wines are $6.00 and the Well cocktails are $4.00.

SERVICE:
Tom our server was pretty cool and on top of things.  He worked hard at refilling our glasses and had an intimate knowledge of the menu, both HH and regular dinner.  Even though this was HH, there was a focus on the regular menu.

FOOD:
Everything we tried was excellent.  The salad, Fondue and meatloaf sandwich, were all very large. While the Korean Beef on the Stick was very good though it could be larger.  But it too was delicious, and not overly spicy.

PRICES:
As I mentioned the Happy Hour food prices were all $6.00. Our bill came to under $41 including taxes but not gratuities.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Marissa was a fantastic server. Food was simply amazing. We will definitely be back. Very fun and delicious signature cocktails too"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Based on all of the stellar ratings, I was really excited to have a major culinary experience. What I got was an overpriced bar with overhyped food. That said, the best part of Culinary Dropout was their service! Our server was excellent. She was very knowledgeable, friendly, and made sure we were happy. The outdoor seating was great for people watching. I just wish the food had lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"The ribs. The ribs. The ribs. Travelled from the country has yielded some tender, well sauce meat, but this was near the top. So good.

Beer selection was very good. Cocktails looked tasty

Environment was friendly and inviting. The PATIO! Ugh, so perfect on a shady evening. 

Whoever my server was, he was hysterical and helpful. Perfect level of service. 25% tip level of service."}
{"text":"Pretzel Fondue is to die for!

Fried Chicken is the best I ever had. 

This place is off the charts.


Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Nothing too complex here. Everything tasted well, but there's definitely room for improvement. Meatloaf was cold, the manager did take care of it. Green beans, needed a minute more in the sauté pan.. Fried chicken was good, the dark meat was moist, crisp skin, but the white meat was dry. Homemade potato chips was overly salted. Deviled prosciutto eggs, needed more than just prosciutto. No hostess to greet you. You have to find them. My Singapore sling was well made. My server was good, but I knew she was swamped. I guess a culinary dropout makes meatloaf, a graduate makes a terrine... Maybe it was a terrine, that's why it was cold...."}
{"text":"What happened to their perogies?!!! They used to be amazing. Now they taste and look exactly like they came from freezer section and are Mrs. T's Perogies. This was the whole reason we even came here. Seriously disappointed. On a better note they now have sangria on menu. Last time we were here they didn't but the bartender mixed up some great Sangria anyway. I hope they go back to the old perogies."}
{"text":"I went here for restaurant week. The service was awesome, and the atmosphere was vibrant. The salmon bruschetta was delicious. For my entree, I tried the Beef rib sandwich which did not taste good. It was very.. meh. The salmon dish was much better! Overall, a great spot, just wish I hadn't ordered the sandwich. :-/"}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent, which is why it's getting 2 stars instead of 1.

The whole experience was tarnished by the EXTREMELY loud and horrible EDM \"music\" from the pool area (back side of restaurant is open to the pool).  The bass was just so overwhelming that you could feel it rattle in your jaw and 2 of us left with migraines.  And this is coming from someone who's been to hundreds of metal shows.  At least when I go to a concert I know what I'm getting into and I bring earplugs in case it's too loud.  

I shouldn't have to bring earplugs to dinner.  It's really a shame because the restaurant is great otherwise.  If they ever change locations I'll be back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat and have drinks in Tempe hands down!  Perfect place to bring friends and family from out of town."}
{"text":"Delicious good & specialty cocktails! Be sure to make a reservation if you're wanting to come by for dinner. This place gets packed!"}
{"text":"Whoever decided to put this bad boy together is a genius. It's casual but cool, funky and fun, sportsy but sexy. It's really got something for everyone and I have to assume that it's regularly packed with patrons. If I had a backyard, I'd totally build this bar there. 

Our food was decent -- I had a good salad and nibbles off the appetizers but nothing that stands out to me as gastronomical bliss. It's got a solid selection and range though and our servers were pretty prompt. I get where they're going with the fire pits but I think the execution leaves something to be desired. 

First, glass near fire seems problematic. Also, the fire pits are like really on fire. So you can't reach across the area to share and it becomes this odd game of pass the plate. Our water glasses were hot to the touch and you can imagine what that meant for anyone with a wine or a cocktail. Their menus are paper... and as it turns out, paper can catch on fire. Ours did not but I see the potential for serious hazard. Not sure how you remedy this architectural snafu but maybe turning the blazing pits down would be a good first start. 

It's legit though -- I'd come here for some beers and pretzel bites, a round of cornhole and some flaming fun."}
{"text":"Fun ambience, great funky decor, live music, killer cocktails and food, what more could you ask for? 
The El Matador was sooo good!!! Kyle was our bartender and was great! Five stars!"}
{"text":"We had a great time and enjoyed the food and drinks. 
We tried their staple pretzels with beer cheese as well as the antipasti platter, which features small portions of very expensive meats and cheeses at a reasonable price. 

The deviled eggs were good but nothing amazing. We tried the fifty dollar bill drink and smashed Irishman, pleasantly surprised at how tasty they were. 

We ended the night with the salted Carmel custard. My friend thought it was too sweet but I liked it. 

Our service was outstanding. The only real negative was a hostess that my friend saw in the bathroom who didn't wash her hands but proceeded to fluff her hair and rub her hands on her lips. Eww!! We are hoping she was only a hostess and didn't touch any food.  

Note: if you're looking for the game area, they are not at this location.  This location is in a great area for wandering and shopping though."}
{"text":"I've yet to visit a Fox restaurant that I didn't like, and Culinary Dropout is no different. The laid-back cool feel, eerily good looking staff, and funky decor make for a fun Happy Hour or dinner spot in Scottsdale. As usual, everything is tasty, and starting with the pretzel bread fondue will not disappoint. Burgers, salads...all the entrees are sturdy and good, but the stars are really the appetizers and the drinks. Feeling adventurous (or cheap)? Get the paper bag special...a \"mystery\" cheap beer served in a tiny, can-sized paper bag."}
{"text":"The food is super tasty, I would eat the pretzel bites until I was sick if I could. The drinks are reasonably priced, and I've had decent service every time I go. My only complaint would be the wait time. Because it's a great place the waits get crazy, but if you plan ahead then you shouldn't have much of an issue."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner with my niece and nephew and their families while visiting Phoenix last weekend. Good food at reasonable prices. My spouse and I split a burger and a chicken entrée salad, and both were really good, although the salad was a little shy on the chicken.

I ordered an old fashioned (my favorite cocktail), and they did it right: No muddling or splash of seltzer water, just bourbon, bitters, an orange peel and a Luxardo cherry (not one of those highly processed neon cherries) on ice. But it was a little watered down. My guess is the bartender made our drinks and they sat too long with the ice melting before our server brought them to us.

Loved The Yard, with games like ping pong and Foosball. I played with my niece's and nephew's kids until an employee came up and told me that kids aren't allowed in The Yard after 6 p.m. Really? Not even with adult supervision? That kinda sucked. They had to go back to the table and watch other people play games they wanted to play.

I would come back for dinner but not with kids. It was too heartbreaking to tell them they couldn't play the games."}
{"text":"This is a must stop for me now. Me and a few buddies went for breakfast on morning and we talked about the potatoes for at least a week! Also the fried chicken and meatloaf."}
{"text":"The food was great--take the advice of the other reviews and get the fondue! Also got the deviled eggs. I only had a couple, but could have indulged with more :) You could easily make a meal out of just the appetizers!

I also ordered a burger. It was tasty, but nothing too special. I wish I had gotten more apps, as those were incredible!

It's kind of pricey. Still, a good place with a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in the area and planning on trying something new and found this place. The Atmosphere was very hip and vibe, and we were seated really fast and was offered drinks the moment we sat down. After about 10 minutes of waiting, we received our drinks and began to order our Antipasti. Everything was going fine with the fine cheeses until we received our cornbread, which was flavorless even with butter and whatever the powdery cheese was that also had no flavor. It took yet another 10 minutes for the server to come to check on us, and another 10 minutes for us to order. My girlfriend ordered the Turkey Pastrami with fries, and I ordered the 36-hour smoked pork ribs with fries and coleslaw.  
Here is where everything started to go wrong, it took a while again to receive the food and be offered drinks again, or even had our water topped off. 

Our food was...TERRIBLE. The Ribs and sandwich came out lukewarm and cold, and our fries were soggy and cold. Our server was nice enough to send it back, and have it come out hot. Let me say this, we spent $75 for a meal, so we expect FRESH food ESPECIALLY for BBQ ribs (36 hours smoked at that) and turkey pastrami which is always served as HOT sandwich. We got our food back another 5 minutes later which we were extremely disappointed as the food was incredibly salty, almost inedible, and the food was dried out from microwaving. That is not okay, what restaurant charges 3/4's of a $100 for food that is not fresh, incredibly salty, and microwaved. We were tired out after a long day and with 2 hours of service that should have taken no longer than 45 minutes-hour, we come to the conclusion that we will not be returning. This was just awful.

Tip (for the cooks): If you advertise ribs that have cooked for 36 hours, a customer such as myself expects the meat to fall off the bone, and be real juicy. Not a microwaved saltpile. That goes for the Turkey Pastrami. 

We give this place 2 stars solely cause the bartenders were magical with their drinks and the server was very polite and easy to talk to."}
{"text":"We loved this location! The food and service was fantastic. The kids loved playing games while the adults had a chance to visit. The valet parking was a great bonus, no charge, but we tipped generously. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I was at their opening weekend event with Local First Arizona.  

First off...I need the soft pretzel & Provolone Fondue in my life every single day since!  They were so soft and the provolone fondue was creamy and serious perfection! My friend and I accidentally filled up on these and hardly ate any of our entree.  Whoops...but we didn't care, it was sooooo worth it!

And as for the Bacon Bloody Mary I had...well, THAT was something to remember!  I will be coming back just fo the pretzels and the bloody mary.  I'll probably be judged by everyone sitting around me as I scarf the pretzels and wash it down with the BM.  But who cares?!

That being said, I didn't love my entree as much.  I got the shaved prime rib dip.  While the prime rib was cooked and shaved just right, it wasn't something that jumped out at my tastebuds.  My friend had the Italian Grinder and didn't' feel partial to it either.  Neither one of our sandwiches were gross, but they just weren't what we were hoping for.  

Loved the bathrooms here!  They are communal and tripped me out for a slit second.  But it was even funnier to watch a man come in as I was getting ready to walk out.  He turned around faster than he could zip his fly up.  He was so embarrassed and thought he had walked in to the women's side.  Hee hee.  

I love the atmosphere Culinary Dropout has put together here.  It has this awesome yard vibe but with a modern and stylish fun.  Not sure I'd go here again for an entree.  But I'd love to come back for the pretzels, BM, and to sit outside and take more of the restaurant in."}
{"text":"Had a great time for happy hour, great choices tried the Korean shrimp and chicken and it was great. Everyone told me to try the soft pretzel with fondue and I am glad I did. The service was really great too, can't wait to come back when its cooler and really enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, with a creative menu that is executed very well. The 36-hour ribs just fell off the bone, and the fried chicken was done to perfection. We ordered 7 appetizers and they all tasted great. Service was awesome as well. I can't wait to come back again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the low ratings this place has gotten, because I had a wonderful experience here last night! Granted, it was a first date, so maybe the stars in my eyes had more to do with my companion(?) I really liked the open-ness of the place, the colors and low lighting. The chairs were pretty comfy too! Here's what happened:

Unsure of what our future plans were, we started with the antipasto menu (not available in the bar, I heard). A couple of cheeses, veg's and meats were really fun to share and made for good first date food. 
After deciding we were too relaxed and close to the movie we planned to see, we ordered dinner. Holy hell- I cannot say enough about the butternut squash ~pure genious! It combined my absolute faves- butternut squash and ricotta cheese, along with some mushrooms and brussel sprouts (very small pieces-dont be afraid!) It was like dinner and dessert rolled into one. We also tried the spare rib pasta. It was good, but definitely overshadowed by the other main course. 

As first dates go, I found out that my companion has a sweet tooth, so bring on dessert-dessert! Our server ferverntly recommended the custard, whichis, as I had previously told my new-date, something that I absolutely adore! It came in a glass overflowing with carmel popcorn! The p-corn had nothn on the custard! OMG! SO great! Terribly rich though. We couldnt finish it. (but after everything else we had, its not a wonder why)

Our server was amazing as well, she provided us with food ideas and always made sure our drinks were filled. She checked in to see that we were happy, but didnt bug us. It was a great experience and I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I ate here on a Saturday afternoon. The atmosphere was awesome and our server was amazing. I ate the burger and it was solid, actually one of the best burgers I have had in a long time. My buddy had the chicken sandwich, he said it was awesome! Overall I would highly recommend this spot to anyone. The outside decor was really cool. My only complaint is that the music from the pool/rehab was really loud. Overall not a big deal!"}
{"text":"The inside was comfortable. It the area outside was too hot. The staff did turn the fans up but it wasn't quite enough. 
Food was good. Really good, but the menu is Limited if you want more then finger food. 
Wait staff was great. Friendly and willing to go the extra mile. 

The 3 stars is solely. Excuse it was hot out there."}
{"text":"Good food and good cocktail. Just slow service. It's always busy last 6pm and make sure to stay inside after 7pm so they can serve you better. Love their pretzels."}
{"text":"Pork belly toast with sriracha sauce and cucumber was excellent. Expected not to like the smashed Irishman drink since I don't like beer or whiskey but it was really good, without the harsh bite I expected. Service was good but not great. Nothing horrible or exceptional.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in Scottsdale for dinner before leaving Phoenix to head home from vacation.  The sangria was delicious.  The appetizers (chips and meatloaf sandwich) were yummy and just right.  The shrimp salad was a very entree.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout Where have you been!?!! I've lived in Vegas for over 6 years now, recently had a friend in town at the Hard rock and we stumbled across this place and fell in love. The food is delicious and had the best Moscow mule with fresh slices of ginger with jalapeño made by Matt. Delish!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty fun it's connected to the yard so you can order food and drinks then play cornhole, ping pong, or Foosball. The food was like an updated gastro pub kind of food. It had a smaller menu but fun drinks. The only drawback for me was the drinks were waaaay over priced."}
{"text":"The Italian grinder is fantastic and the grilled cheese sliders were great too! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"What's the big deal?  I feel like this place is over priced.  Their ideas are ok, but nothing spectacular.  Portions aren't very big.  I might come back and see if anything's improved once a year or so...  Or maybe come for happy hour where I can see what's going on at a lower rate.."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food.  Close to light rail stop is a huge plus in my book.  Service was ok.  Appetizers were very good, mussels were done well, ribs were tasty.  I was disappointed in the corn cannelloni, it was good but not special.  Everyone in our party had a good time."}
{"text":"This place is perfect! Somehow, it can accommodate a family setting with children and a typical scottsdale bar hopping crew at the same time! It has delicious food but the drinks are unbelievable. BEST BLOODY MARY in town!!"}
{"text":"3 out of 6 of our group had serious dietary restrictions including gluten and dairy free. The waitress was very familiar with the menu and ingredients, alternate meal arrangements and substitutes to accommodate. She gave multiple options for everyone and was very thorough. The food  did take a while to be served up to about 45 minutes or so but we were in no hurry and enjoy conversation, ambiance and drinks while waiting. The food was good and follow up/attentiveness of our server was fantastic. We enjoyed ourselves and will definitely return."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Culinary Dropout in The Phoenix area.  Nice atmosphere and great food.  The servers were very attentive and helpful. We all enjoyed our meal and would visit again if we find ourselves in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Now, it's said, God is happiest when his children are at play. 

I wouldn't know about that.

But Culinary Dropout is where the rest of us come to play. 

I would say that some of Fox's other Concepts need more time on the drawling board, but Dropout is a judgement free zone of piercings and tattoos and Burts Bee's Beard Wax and skinny jeans. 

Where statements of individualities are clash and blur like Saragossa sea of trends. 

All ironies forgiven. 

But I like it here. 

And why not, their menu is an unapologetic assortment of Gutsronomy / Fusion ' esque recipes pulled from other tried and true places not here. 

This place has just that right sort of atmosphere that allows you to eat well and socialize with music provided but not to disrupt the luxuries of either.

It's good for families or just a night out with the babysitter. ------ take that however you want to.  :-)

And they have games for drunks. It's like if your frat house decided to open up a restaurant. 

And that's not terrible. The path of least resistance has lead to more then a few comfortable seats here. 

I give them great credit for that, they are comfortable. 

I don't know where this old-is-new trend in restaurants came from--you know, where the sit you in Circa 1940's hardwood, Boarding School, desktop chairs--but if I wanted my ass to go numb, I would've purchased 2 Groupons for that \"Discount Dominatrix\". 

. . . Aaand. 

And... that's all I have to say about that -- Forrest Gump."}
{"text":"Went there twice and love the atmosphere. Was a little frustrated with the long wait since I had a reservation but the good food and service made up for that. The first time I went I got the meatloaf which was perfect. The second time I went I got the fried chicken that was a bit on the salty side for my opinion but the biscuits were perfect"}
{"text":"Awesome hangout and delicious food!!
Looks can be deceiving, from the Hotel lobby it looks like a little bar, but it has a huge outdoor patio next to the pool, fantastic food, great happy hour and awesome service !! We went there twice in one day it was so good!!
I wish they served breakfast, I would eat there 3 times a day. I highly recommend the fresh hot soft pretzels with hot cheese fondue! Great vibe and big comfy chairs, we hung out for a few hours during happy hour and they didn't try to rush us out of there. 
I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Cool place on the Waterfront!  I love the atmosphere, the food was good and the service wasn't bad.  Great place to sit outside and people watch."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Of course we found it on Yelp with great rating, so we wanted to try it out.  Culinary Dropout is located in a huge building with indoor and outdoor seating.  You can make reservations, but who would have thought on a Tuesday night at 7pm there would still be a 30 minute wait to be seated.  The resturant was alive with lots of activity. Loud music tonight and a really good mix of young and old enjoying their meals.  I already posted the menu.  How can you not want to try a place called Culinary Dropout? We got seated quicker than 30 minutes and Wyatt our waiter was right there  getting our drink orders and explaining the menu. We were sitting at a round wooden table with really comfortable chairs. The atmosphere is very fun, but loud. What do you expect from a packed restaurant.  I could hear my husband so the noise level didn't interfere with our conversation.  Dinner OMG, we started with the pretzels and cheese. About 20 soft round pieces of pretzel which just about melted in your mouth.  I got the meatloaf which was the best meatloaf I have had in the Phoenix area.  My husband had a late lunch and he had the grinder. We really enjoyed ourselves.  They do have live music and other events.  I definitely want to go back with a whole group of friends. Good food, great services (thanks Wyatt) good times."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! We made reservations last Saturday but couldn't get in because of the long wait. Then management sent us a text offering to come back and have dinner again on them for the inconvenience. The food was great and the staff is friendly and helpful. Thank you so much for welcoming us back to your restaurant. Great drinks and atmosphere too, one of my favorite date nights in Scottsdale ever!"}
{"text":"The yard is a great Sunday afternoon casual drinking and eating place! There's lots or little to do depending on your energy level! I had the seared ahi salad, definitely worth a try at $15. Great time with the family!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and excellent service! I had the roasted salmon and my husband had the shaved prime rib."}
{"text":"Delicious pretzel balls with cheese fondue- enough for four. Wasabi ahi tuna salad combined many textures and tasted amazing. Both the Pistols at Dawn and Old Fashioned cocktails were to die for. Wish I could hold my alcohol better. Eat and drink here- great experience all around."}
{"text":"Delicious food with great service.

Bathrooms are a bit far away but not to be missed (doors & mirror).

The prices are a little steep but worth it for a nice splurge.

I had the Korean Style Ribeye Caps ($26).  Delicious and smaller portion which leaves room for appetizer or dessert.  My husband is gluten free so ordered the 36 hour pork ribs and fries ($23).  The iced tea was also quite good."}
{"text":"I wish this restaurant would open a location in Los Angeles!  See ... in Los Angeles we have a lot of these \"foody-type places\" that just suck.  They're these middling restaurants that cost $50-$75 or $100 for two and they think they're all rad and ... they're not.

I just said to my girlfriend that I would almost drive the 3 hours to Vegas to have the turkey pastrami sandwich they have.  It's fantastic.

We started with pretzels and provolone cheese sauce.  Again, fantastic!  

The charcuterie was both generous and the selections were very well-curated.  

I should also mention the service.  In Los Angeles we have actor-waiters.  They suck.  Perhaps not all of them suck but at least 90% of them suck.  We both always tell people to get real service -- and sometimes \"real food\" -- one has to go to Vegas.  This restaurant didn't disappoint.  Anne Marie was amazing.  She knew the menu well and made recommendations that we all enjoyed a lot.  

Oh, yeah, the Manhattan cocktail they have is terrific!

When we go back to as a couple and not when I'm there for meetings we are DEFINITELY going back here for at least one meal!  

Bravo, guys!  Now ... get off your asses and come to Los Angeles!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very delicious and the beer selection was awesome. I highly recommend the charcuterie plate and the Brussels sprouts!"}
{"text":"Cute brunch spot we dropped in to on the way to the airport. No wait for the Sunday brunch crowd. We wanted the fried chicken, but didn't have a lot of time to wait. 
We got the bloody mary with a slice of bacon and a ginger/cabernet drink with the word don in title. 
I got the yesterday's soup which was broccoli and cheese with chicken, my husband got the turkey sandwich which was also great. 
The service was great and our waitress was so nice and informative. I also like how the waitresses wore their own clothes, no uniforms made it seem very personal and relaxing just hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Visiting PHX area before flying out on a European trip and decided to give this a try for Dinner on a Wednesday evening and did a quick reservation online via open table in the afternoon .   Very easy to find and there a big parking lot and also valet parking available if you don't want to walk through the parking lot.  This place is huge.  Good thing we made a reservation as there were several graduation parties going on so this place was hopping.  I honestly don't remember what we had, but it must have been good, because after flight issues, we decided to come back again the next night for dinner again.  Happy to see they use HF Coors (Arizona made plates and dishes)! and have lots of good options for meals and drinks.  The Fried chicken was great as well as their Kale salad. We had the Pretzel fondue and it was excellent and a very large portion, that a small table of 3 could not come close to finishing, probably since we were not drinking a lot.   There was live music on Thursday evening.  Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and the first time was awesome, lots of laughs, great service, delicious food. Of course, I had a few at the bar before, so everything was fun...
The next time, we had dinner on the patio. We waited and waited and had to ask the waitress who was waiting on the people right next to us for service. We finally had a nice young man wait on us and of course, we waited for everything. We waited for the water, drinks and the food. 
So, we will be back but not too soon. Okay, here is a funny story to share...We sat next to 2 women who asked their server if the Articoke salad had articokes in it...come on, that is funny."}
{"text":"great food! Thai Chili wings and Fried Chicken were delicious. Do yourself a favor and get the Antipasta."}
{"text":"Food was good but our order was so badly done (sausage soup without sausage; dangerously undercooked egg), that the manager came to our table and offered a free dessert.  Drinks were good; food was ok.  Noise level was deafening and we could not hear each other talk.  Servers were overworked and place is understaffed. Force valet parking is unnecessary in a huge lot.  Not worth a return trip."}
{"text":"We just had an good overall experience at culinary dropout. Our waiter was nice and gave us several great recommendations from drinks to appetizers to entrées. I have that between-you-and-me drink which was Belvedere vodka and a mixture of juices, it was amazing! For an appetizer we had the pretzels and cheese which were delicious. For dinner I had the sweet potato cannelloni which was fabulous also. It was an overall great experience they also had live music which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Wife:  This is my favorite place to go with friends!  The Yard, linked in with Culinary Dropout is an offers plenty of entertainment, (ping pong, shuffle board and corn hole) making it an ideal place to socialize and talk smack!   Culinary Dropout's food is always delicious!  Watch out though!  The serving size is humongous!!! Ladies, I strongly suggest sharing a plate if you are not a hardy eater!!! Their Soft Pretzel with Provolone Fondue was absolutely AMAZING!!!!  I have a hard time just eating one.    I absolutely love their House Smoked Salmon and their Beer Battered Fish & Chips were wonderful!  Hubby had their Meatloaf.  Of course, I had to try it out too.  And yes, as always, this dish was excellent!!!  I totally recommend this place, especially if you are meeting with other people!

Hubby:  Just a fun, energetic place for all crowds.  I generally split whatever the Mrs. Is having and try to play some corn hole if available.  Bathroom freaked me out first time I went as you wash your hands you can see into the ladies side.  Like wife said, great social gathering place."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best cocktails, good food, and great service. Sam is an amazing bartender as well. He always takes great care of us when we go."}
{"text":"Bad Service... Good Food

So we went on a Thursday night with 4 people at about 7:30pm. The restaurant wasn't busy but we had made a reservation just to be safe. We ordered the mystery drink shot thing and were disappointed that we ended up with keystone and some terrible raspberry whiskey shot for $8, but it was a mystery thing so we get what we get! I also ordered the pretzel bites which were delicious!!! (even better when you reheat them later after a night of drinking) I also ordered the steak tacos which were really good but I ate waaaay too many pretzel bites to really enjoy the tacos.

Our only complaint was the terrible service. After getting our food for us our waiter disappeared for over thirty minutes. We watched him chatting with other staff members, checking his phone, doing anything but coming over to see if we needed anything. We finally had to ask another staff member to get our checks for us.

I still give it four stars because the food was really good and I am sure some of the other waiters are more attentive!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Wednesday and it wasn't too busy. This is one of the coolest restaurants I've ever been to! They have ping pong tables, yard games and super spacious and fun seating. Our waitress was very friendly. Our food came out quickly and was all delicious. I wish the cheese plate came with crackers or bread. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Oh this place has gone downhill, it's not even a place I'd go back to. Service was bad, food came out all different times. Everything's over priced and lacking flavor. So sad, the first time we went we raved about how good it was, in just a year it's plummeted. 
The atmosphere is great, they have a nice outdoor space and bar. 
They need to get it together, I had the grilled cheese and didn't wanna eat it, and that's rare!  How can u mess up grilled cheese?
We also ordered the Italian grinder,  just a bunch of deli meat thrown on bread. I coulda made that at home. 
So sad, this place a awesome, now it less than mediocre. I wonder what happened."}
{"text":"I first saw Culinary Dropout in Austin, TX, but I had missed my opportunity of trying it there. I saw that there were several locations in AZ, but both a Lyft driver and my friend, who is a local, suggested that we go to the Tempe location. Culinary Dropout is such a cool restaurant, and I so wish that there was one in the Bay Area (specifically San Jose, CA, of course)! It is the perfect place for a fun date night or a chill, lowkey hangout with all of your friends. It has indoor seating, a centralized bar, an open lounge area, a games area, and a stage. This location has valet parking. 

What I thought was awesome about Culinary Dropout was how it can be the one-stop shop for your all around entertainment needs. You can go there to play games, listen to a live band, or watch sports. There were plenty of TVs all around the restaurant, and I was pleased that the Warriors game was playing right by our table. After dinner, we went to the games area and rented out pucks to play table shuffleboard. Other games I saw were Cornhole and Ping Pong. There may have been more further in the back, but I didn't venture past this area. 

Great customer service on all levels. I previously had made reservations for 6:00pm through OpenTable. We were stuck in an hr of traffic to get out of the damn airport, so I must've called the restaurant 3x's to keep pushing our reservation back. Shoutout to the hostesses who did their best accommodating us. They were able to fit us in at 7pm, which ended up being perfect timing. As soon as we walked in, there was a table ready to go for us. I really appreciate when we don't have to wait longer for a table to clear up. The wait staff was awesome. Our waitress, in particular, was upbeat, friendly, and attentive. Since 2 out of the 3 of us were new to Culinary Dropout, she gave us a detailed rundown on what was good on the menu and how to order the meat and cheese board. 

The cocktails were enjoyable and certainly creative. I had the Drunken Panda, and my friends ordered a Deviant Behavior and Between You and Me. The Drunken Panda was very refreshing with the cucumber sake and calamansi. As I drank the cocktail, I would top off the glass with Lucky Buddha lager. Between You and Me tasted slightly bitter and tart from the grapefruit. Deviant Behavior tasted like strawberry lemonade. I felt like I could down those back to back no problem lol.

I thought the food was excellent. There were so many items off the menu that I wanted to try, but I was able to narrow it down to the Shaved Prime Rib Dip and Fried Chicken. Luckily my bestie wanted the same things. We figured one of us would order one item, the other person order the second item, and then we share halves. Our waitress did us a favor by recommending us to split these items, which was an awesome alternative since everything was portioned evenly. The Shaved Prime Rib Dip was pretty good. i'm not sure if it was coming off the meat or the au jus, but there was something salty and peppery I liked about it. The side of fries were cooked well too. I loved the fried Chicken platter. It came with sides of mashed potatoes with gravy, coleslaw, and a biscuit with honey drizzled. The coleslaw had creamy dressing that it wasn't overly drenched in, which allowed for a nice crunch. The mashed potatoes were smooth and buttery. The biscuit was fine but a bit dry. Lastly, the fried chicken was delicious. I found that the chicken meat was moist, and I liked the sweetness of the fried batter."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time.  All I have to say is \"Wow!\"  This place from the decor to the food just blew me away.  The place has such a homey feel to it that my wife and I enjoyed it right off the bat.

We had the pretzel and provolone cheese dip for an appetizer.  This thing was just phenomenal.  The pretzel, seasoned with sea salt, comes out with a nice provolone dip.  The pretzel was great with or without the dip.  

We had the Korean Ribeye Cap.  This thing blew my wife and me away.  The meat was so tender and juicy.  They cooked this thing where everything was perfect.  The spice, the vegetables, the seasoning, the meat; everything came together for a perfect blend.  This is the one thing I would recommend everyone trying.

For dessert we had the monkey bread.  Like someone else already posted if you wanted a bread pudding mixed with your favorite cinnamon roll this would be it.

Everything is great, the price is reasonable (especially considering this is Vegas), the waiters are very attentive, and the cooks are great.

Like I said this has become a staple visit every time I come out to Vegas."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice about Culinary Dropout are the HUGE comfy chairs that surround some of the tables. And the leather couches and the gorgeous chandeliers. The wait staff doesn't wear uniforms and is extremely knowledgable and helpful. Our waitress steered us toward the soft pretzel fondue as an appetizer and we were very glad she did. Warm salty pretzels and a cheese fondue = heaven!
The chopped salad was yummy - but a little less dressing would have been nice. The flavors of the salad got a teeny bit drowned in it. But still a good one. 
The only drawback is that this is a very noisy space - especially when there is live music, as there was on our recent Saturday night visit. The band was wonderful, don't get me wrong, but we couldn't hear each other due to the music, the large table and the general acoustics of the room. No biggie for us that night, but if you want to catch up with old friends, head to the patio so you can hear each other.
The wine list was nice - smaller side, but what was there was good!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food, great servers.

They don't force valet anymore. I'd suggest getting an antipasti appetizer and MA THE MEATLOAF or the Pub burger. I've had the Rainbow Trout and Beef Stroganoff, and they're very tasty and flavorful! The serving sizes aren't huge--good news for you, tubby!"}
{"text":"The Butternut Squash Cannelloni is AMAZING!!! I can honestly say that this is one of the most delicious things I have eaten in a long time! Fun atmosphere and great service. If I lived in town, I would definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"If you come to eat, ask to be seated in John John's section.  He's the most amazing waiter I've ever had in my 43 years on this planet.  Your drinks are replaced before they're empty.  Food is brought out immediately.  Drop a napkin, John John will have a new napkin on your table before the old one hits the ground.  He definitely made our experience there one we will never forget.  Amazing waiter. Thanks John John!"}
{"text":"Lauren was our waitress this weekend, and she was amazing. The food was great, the drinks were on point, and the atmosphere was very cool. There is a nice area outside with a great view."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere!! I almost never write reviews but I had to for this place. The whole setup is just amazing with how it's semi outdoors semi indoors. You get such a unique feeling in here that's hard to find anywhere else. The wait was a bit long but the waiting area has bags, ping pong tables, and all sorts of benches and seats to relax & socialize while you wait. After getting seated all 3 of the employees that helped us were excellent! It's nice here how they all work together instead of getting assigned one waiter/waitress like the typical restaurant. The food is a bit pricey, but it's worth it. The ribs were awesome (highly recommend them!) This is the perfect spot for a date or a Saturday night with friends."}
{"text":"Love this place, great comfort food. The Mussels and ribs were to die for. Atmosphere is great and could day drink all day here!"}
{"text":"Girls Night Out celebrating my 60th birthday!!  The place was full of Great energy! The food was delicious. BUT best of all Kyle our server was absolutely amazing! seriously! He made the evening for all of us. He was attentive and fun and not bad on the eyes. We had a wonderful time. Thank you Kyle!  We will return!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fabulous.  The weather was perfect and we were able to sit in the Yard area and stayed most of the afternoon. We had Yesterday's soup which is a great concept as the flavor is always better next day (as the menu stated).   Also tried the pretzels, Fish and Chips, and sampled many beers. Our server was tremendous.  He was a musician who made our day much more enjoyable as he engaged in fun conversations with us as he took care of us.  Service was perfect--we wanted for nothing!  We weren't very hungry so I will definitely go again and try some of the other menu items.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It angers me to be so hyped up about a place and then have to give them such a low grade rating. Overrated, overpriced and under serviced would be the top 3 ways I could describe it. I was so stoked to try the new raw bar, fresh antipasta made in front of you, outdoor seating with firepits restaurant the Hard Rock was offering. Not to mention menu choices like beef stroganoff, ribs, fried chicken, and meatloaf. I for sure thought I would be in heaven. 
Now let me start with the 2 good things about this place.
1- The ambiance. It was a huge indoor/outdoor 2 bars, view of the pool. AMAZING set up. If you sit indoors, you can watch them make your antipasti platter fresh in front of you which brings me to the the highlight of the meal
2- THE ANITPASTI! So it was for sure over priced. $8 per cured meat. $5 per cheese. $4 per snack (snacks included olives peppers, bread, etc)
My super awesome platter cost $38. Sad that it was the only thing worth it. The meats were perfectly salted and the cheeses were imported. I would actually order this again if I wasn't worried about the cost. 
Thats it. All the positives. 
On to the reason for the 2 star rating. First and foremost the shitty service. Not only was our waiter unattentive and slow. He was careless. He didn't once offer to refill our empty glasses we had to ask. He didn't notice nor care that 1 of the 4 of us barley touched her food due to it being undercooked. (seriously meatloaf pink??) We also noted that our order was put in around 7:30, and we were patiently awaiting our check at 9:20. 
Between us we had ribs that had jalapeno in the title, yet tasted sweet. 2 orders of undercooked meatloaf. And a steak. 
The side items were decent, but even the taters that came with the meatloaf lacked consistency. 
My boyfriend insisted we get dessert since all 4 of us were still hungry and there are not many places in town you can get freshly made monkey bread. Again a dissapointment. Small, and it took more like 20 minutes versus the 10 they claimed it to take. 
Overall the bad food may have been a fluke. I could tell there was a potential for yummy-ness had they cooked the meatloaf another hour, added spice to the ribs, and a little love in their kitchen. On this trip they really lived up the the \"culinary dropout\" name and left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I get the same thing to eat every time I come here.  I start with the cheap house salad which is delish.  Then I get the turkey pastrami.  I hate coleslaw but the place kills it with the apple slaw its so good.  The turkey pastrami is an amazing sandwich and they never disappoint.  However I do wish they still had the strawberry jalapeño margarita!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night following a triathlon and we were ready to eat I'll tell you.  Although the service we had from our waiter was courteous it was not prompt.  From the moment we sat down we waited for a long while, we ordered two beers...the she had was the Abita Purple Haze, maybe that will be desert.  I had the Iron Fist American Pale I believe and it was strong.

I will say though, those ribs might be 3 star, but that's because my expectation of ribs are so high and rarely met.  So good show, they were solid. And I'd eat them again.  She had the Mac  Burger...why would I try to eat that ptuy it tasted like a Big Mac...why you have things that taste ew?  

I like the concept...but service made this thing tank, and the amount of employees running around for such poor service shows that the staff is under or poorly trained."}
{"text":"Have been to Culinary Dropout/ The yard a few times and haven't had a bad experience yet. The staff are friendly and attentive and the food/drinks are good. Nice atmosphere and pretty cool that you can play cornhole and table tennis etc. My brother and my best friend were in town from Australia and raved about the pretzel bites!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, but holy frickin crap somebody please tell the band they dont have to play so loud.  The four of us sat at the table and had to scream at one another to be heard even then we were still asking each other \"what did you say\"."}
{"text":"Great meatloaf (mouthwatering). I hated when it was gone!"}
{"text":"I have been to Culinary Dropout a couple of times and my enjoyment is based on how crowded or uncrowded it is.  We stopped in a while back on a rainy Sunday afternoon and really enjoyed sitting at the bar and enjoying a Room Service cocktail (ooh la la!).  Next time I'll enjoy the pretzels and cheese fondue again...totally sinful!"}
{"text":"I went here last night at 7pm with a party of 7.  We were certain the place would be busy so we called ahead.  Turns out the place was pretty dead the entire 2 hours we were there.  This is why I love AZ in the summer.

I love the decor of the place.  It is real open and airy (at least when they have all the doors open), they have nice big tables and comfortable seating.  The decorations are interesting as well.  The whole place has a great vibe to it.  I just don't like it that they play the music a bit too loud.

Though I didn't have any, they have a pretty impressive and reasonably priced beer/wine/interesting cocktail menu.  They have a big list of real random cocktails that I would like to come back and sample.

The Food:

* House Potato Chips = excellent. a bit too salty though.  I have no idea why the onion dip is famous; it is pretty good but nothing that you couldn't get out of a can.
* Soft Pretzels & Fondu = very good and exactly what you would expect....pretzels and melted cheese.  Nothing fancy.
*Artichoke Salad = very interesting and pretty good.
* Kurobuta Pork Ribs = excellent. very very tender and very very tasty.  this dish really doesn't jive with the rest of the menu but whatever...I ordered it anyway to go against the grain of my party.  The fries and cole slaw that come with are not very good.
* Ricotta Gnocchi = very interesting and pretty good.

This place is very interesting to say the least thus the name I guess.  I'm not sure I would rush back but it was very good and the service was great."}
{"text":"Ahhh culinary dropout...where do start? 

There was nothing particularly  wrong with our visit. There were seven of us for a bachelorette party and just wanted good dinner and drinks. The apps were fine (pretzel fondue, chips, chicken skin, etc). It wasn't until we got our entrées is where things were off.

Combined we ordered: the burger, pork belly ramen, steak, fried chicken and the ribs. I had a taste of it all and it was okay, with the exception of the fried chicken. The fried chicken was amazing! I wish I ordered that rather than the burger. 

It's worth a trip out and to try for yourself. But nothing to run home to tell mom about."}
{"text":"Noisy ambiance with hard surfaces, loudish music, and cavernous spaces.decibels reading via my phone was 85, and this was on a Tuesday late
Lunch.

Uninspired menu. We had difficulty choosing what we wanted to eat, not because there were many options, but because there were so few. Little that could be called healthy eating, our impression was that this was a young mans restaurant. One of us had the cannelloni, which was good. Tomato, asparagus and shallot in a butter sauce with Parmesan. Another had the kale and sweet corn salad. Mostly kale with tiny amounts of roasted cauliflower, snap peas (2), avocado, almonds, goat cheese. It was suppose to have roasted beets, but I never found them. Dressing was bland and unremarkable. Our third had the BBQ pork belly nachos. Interesting\"chips\" with a little pork belly, a nice amount of guacamole, some salty black beans, covered with a glutenous cheese sauce that weighed down everything and contributed to a general sogginess after about 5 minutes. 

Servers near us were dressed in short shorts - lace or leather, contributing to a hooters- like atmosphere. Service was good, however.

Parking is challenging, a short trek across a dirt drive. About half a city block. Only one handicap spot near the door that we can see. Grateful we didn't need it.

Food was pricey for what you got - not worth it"}
{"text":"In a quest for an establishment that wouldn't be bursting at the seams with families, we decided to give Culinary Dropout a go for brunch on Mother's Day. I made a reservation for 10a via Opentable. Moseyed in right as they were opening & selected a table on the cusp of inside & outside. Perfect choice! From the hostess to the random employee passing by, everyone was super friendly & chill... my brunchmate seemed memorized by them. Not really knowing what portion sizes to expect, the two of us ordered 3 items to share: Cap'n Crunch french toast, grilled cheese sliders (with fries) & (a special item) asparagus toast. As for the portions- they are more along normal sized (to some they may seem on the small side), so the 3 items for us to share were perfect. The CC french toast was cool!... I'd totally get it again & highly recommend. The grilled cheese sliders & fries were tasty & had great texture... another one I recommend! The asparagus toast should be a regular item... perhaps swapping out the asparagus with whatever is in season? To be honest, I forgot what all was on it... I saw asparagus & was sold. There was perfectly grilled asparagus, truffle oil?, these amazing crackly potatoes & two sunny side up eggs. From the sweet, salty & texture perspectives, we were thoroughly satisfied! By the time we left, the place was full... reservations are definitely the way to go. I'm looking forward to going back again for brunch, but also checking it out for dinner!"}
{"text":"We went for a last minute date night dinner.  Live music is only on Fri and Sat, so we missed the music, which is too bad.  But the food made up for it.  It was delicious and our taste buds were happy.  Here's what we had.  

A share plate of 5 Antipasti items (small portions packed with flavor):  
- Jamon Iberico, truffled crescent and crusty bread, garlic oil & balsamic - delicious combo of flavors and texture
- Korean-style brussel sprouts (with sauce on the side) - crunchy, crispy, charred brussel sprouts with a little spicy and sweet chili paste sauce to balance the slight bitterness of brussel sprouts.
- charred broccoli, red chili oil, parmesan breadcrumb - with a squeeze of lemon juice, it was crunchy, crispy and savory with a tiny amount of tart and spice.  

BBQ PORK BELLY NACHOS - It was exactly what you would want in a great plate of nachos. Great to share, so you don't overdo it.

BISTRO STEAK with horseradish cream, peppercorn bordelaise, herb fries - Steak portion is small (that's not a bad thing necessarily, since it's built in portion control!) and it was cooked to perfection at medium rare and the horseradish cream sauce was awesome, as were the herb fries.

Drinks:  The old fashioned and manhattan cocktails were citrus infused and nicely presented, stirred, on the rocks.  

Excellent menu and drink selection.  Great customer service by the wait staff (very important factor in a restaurant).  They have the right balance and know how to make the customers feel at home.  Two thumbs up to the management, kitchen and service staff."}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast way too hungry to enjoy the open, airy ambiance and the delicious Eggwhite Frittata topped with Sriracha sauce. 

This place is nice for a first, second or multiple dates if you get there as soon as it opens.

It is also a nice place to go if you love to be doted on...waitstaff and the owner I think -- were absolute sweeties."}
{"text":"If u wanna be pleasently disappointed, stop by. We enjoyed our food with plenty of salt and mayo...thank god it's dark. Monkeys are dying on Africa...check out the menu.  Bring a camelbag cuz the bartender takes so long to pour a drink."}
{"text":"Service is amazing. Food is the bomb. Atmosphere is perfect. Shout out to the best bartenders ever, Joseph and Chase, you guys rock! Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and I love the ambiance! It's a great place to go if you're looking for a fun/relaxed atmosphere, and the food is fantastic! As a picky eater, I tried things there I've never tried before, and actually enjoyed them. Good way to go for a night out."}
{"text":"I was out n about w/ one of my roommates running errands and we were both hungry, so I jumped online to find a new lunch spot I have not tried.  Curinary dropout was one of the few choices we were considering and due to its catchy name, I decided that was the place to try.  I'll just start off by saying I'm glad we made the choice we did.

The food was excellent and the service was very friendly.  Definitely gets a thumbs up from me and I am sure to try this place again!"}
{"text":"This place was very sub par.  First of all, the server was extremely rude.  He forgot drinks and most of all blamed us for an order malfunction where one person in our group didn't get his meal.  He was very accusatory and very bad in terms of servicing his guests.  The atmosphere is ehhhhhh and nothing to come and see.  There are many other places on the strip to eat other than this place and in my opinion, would skip this place entirely."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of parents and our soccer kids after a tournament. Place is huge. Great for groups. Looks great on the inside - like a big airplane hangar. Kids menu with great prices. Drinks were unique. I had the something Dove and despite getting crap from my dad friends, it was really good. Everyone loved the ambiance. My group kept talking about how good the food was. Not terribly expensive either. Waitstaff was pretty fast given we had 10+."}
{"text":"The place and venue is phenomenal. Right in the heart of Tempe and Arizona State University. The energy in this place is something else. 

I was where before for lunch, and now came to grab dinner and drinks after work. The place was packed and very, very lively, virtually no place where to sit. 

The 3-stars rating is due to the low customer service. There's just too many people to receive any kind of minimal, acceptable level of customer service. 

The servers staff would benefit if they could spend more time with the people there supposed to be taking care of. 

If you sit at the bar, pick the inside section. The outer section had the AC blowing right on my face. I had the pork belly ramen and some great IPAs from Deschutes"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best part of this hotel. Great burgers and sandwiches in an awesome setting. Cool decor and very comfortable. Nice happy hour options. Loved the turkey pastrami. The hotel is lousy but this restaurant is great!"}
{"text":"god damn i love this place... 

my wife and i frequent this place alot... the food is absolutely amazing.  the service is top notch. i am a big fan of their pretzel balls and meatloaf.. and their oysters are to die for! 

5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Their fried chicken is on point, go get some! Their desserts are also awesome!

I've been here several times and the service has always been great. I also like the laid-back but clean atmosphere. Like I said... try their fried chicken. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I have noticed that when one goes for late lunch, 1 pm or after, one often receives bad service.  I'm not sure why but it happened here, too.

I was seated at the bar and ignored by the bartender who seemed to be washing glasses.  He didn't even say, \"I'll be with you in a minute.\"  He saw me but he said nothing.  Nada.  After 5 minutes, I asked to be reseated.  The hostesses put me at a table in the dining room and I was served immediately.  The food was good.  

Would I return?  No.  It wasn't worth it to me."}
{"text":"Nothing but mistakes! My wife and I went there for lunch last Friday. She ordered a salad, dressing on the side. I ordered a turkey pastrami sandwich that came with coleslaw. The salad came with the dressing on it, not on the side. The sandwich had the coleslaw on it (I had assumed, it was on the side) and it had spicy mustard on it. The menu did not mention the mustard, which I don't like. I asked the waiter if it could be made with the coleslaw on the side and no mustard. \"No problem \", he says. A few minutes later they brought me a new sandwich, it was exactly the same as before with the coleslaw on it and the mustard. This time the manager came over to apologize and tells me he'll take 1/2 off the bill. I told him that wasn't good enough, they screwed up both our orders and he should comp it all. He didn't seem to like that but said ok."}
{"text":"I came here with some fellow out-of-towner Yelpers after reading the buzz here on Yelp and the restaurant's website. Let's just say that it wasn't at all what I expected.

The website proclaims: \"... Culinary Dropout is going to be a really fun, cool and casual chef-driven gastropub.\"

Gastropub? I think not. Try gastroclub (TM).

Instead of a casual, low-key bar that also serves great food, CD is more like a club where the music is more important than the food. Certainly the blaring music dampened any culinary excitement I had when we walked in the door. We could barely hear the hostess as she told us it would be an hour wait. We put our names down anyway, saw that the bar was packed, and then escaped outside to wait.

Eventually we grabbed seats at the outside bar, where two other patrons had just polished off two platters of oysters. No fewer than three servers came to ring up bills and chat while we sat right there in front of them with the platters and dirty silverware piled up, but nobody bothered to greet us or clear the plates until about 10 minutes later. By the time the bartender was ready to take our order, we got called for our table and re-entered the restaurant.

We were seated at a four-top just in front of the stage, where a musician started playing a short time later. Not surprisingly, we had a hard time carrying on our conversations. Instead we buried our heads in the menu, which offered a promising variety of eclectic dishes. Our table went with the onion soup, artichoke salad, fried chicken, butternut squash cannelloni, and kurobuta pork ribs. 

I'll admit the food was good. The artichoke salad was refreshing: crisp shavings of artichoke hearts, asparagus, and endive mixed with some frisee and a slightly sweet vinaigrette. My fried chicken was excellent. Although I initially thought it looked burnt, due to its mahogany color, the meat was succulent. The coating was just a touch spicy with a hint of cayenne, nicely crisp, and also drizzled with some honey. Everybody else enjoyed their food as well. It was the service that continued to be a problem. 

Our waitress, although attentive at first, disappeared after she took our orders. Other servers brought our food to us, which was probably the reason that we received only one order of salad, split. We'd wanted one order to be split between two of us, and another order for the person who was only having soup and salad. When only two bowls of salad were delivered, two of us shared one of them. Later, while we were eating our entrees, yet another server tried to drop off another bowl of salad, but we waved it off thinking it wasn't ours. Suspiciously, however, this bowl was twice as big as the others we'd received. We flagged our waitress over to ask for water and silverware and explained what happened. She promised we'd only be charged for one salad. Yet, when the bill came, we were charged for two. Again, we had to explain that we'd only received the split order--and finally the lightbulb went on, or flickered. After consulting the kitchen to confirm what happened, she redid our bill and apologized.

Would I eat here again? No, not unless it was for lunch because I can't imagine it would be as painfully loud then. The food was good and the service issues can be worked out, but the concept seems confused. Even though the dimly-lit decor featured chairs you might find in a pub and leather banquettes, the overall vibe was far from pub-like. If you're okay with a noisy gastroclub instead of an intimate gastropub, go ahead and come here because the food seems worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a bit indifferent regarding my experience. I'd like to give more stars, but because I stood at the Host station for several minutes before anyone acknowledged my existence made me rate this establishment lower. Although the food increased the rating to the 3 Star because of the superb taste, I was left feeling hungry (I'm a size 2) after due to the small portions. 

This placed was packed on a Tuesday night so the wait was 30-45 minutes, but I was able to quickly find seating for 1 at the bar. There were about 5 guys working the massive bar, so no one acknowledged me for several minutes as well. Once I was greeted by a curly hair bearded gentleman he was nice and pleasant. I really wanted to try the Chicken because of all of the high reviews and it seemed hearty for my empty stomach but elected to try the Roasted Salmon instead. 

The Roasted Salmon came quick and right away I noticed the the proportions were really small for a $22 plate. Nonetheless, I'm aware that Salmon is costly. It was good in taste and satisfying. 

I'd like to give this place another try to improve in service and for the Chicken. A few others near my seat ordered the Chicken; it smelled and looked great plated and I felt that would've fill my stomach. 

I'm leaving to go spend money at a nearby eatery because again, I was left with a semi-full stomach.

UPDATE: I had to come back to my review and update all of the Yelp'ers with my Wow experience from Culinary Dropout. 

About 2 mins after leaving my initial review, I was politely approached by the GM. I had NO idea that this person was a General Manager as she was the one that helped me after I waited to be acknowledged by the hostess post. Anyway, she immediately apologized for the service I received (I'm still in shock that she even knew who I was, I do not have a picture of myself on my Yelp profile). She also mentioned my review and said she'd like an opportunity to make it right and didn't want me to leave without having an opportunity to make things right with me. She offered the Chicken entree AND another glass of Moscato since I spoke about wanting to try it, at first I declined but after a slight push from her I obliged to the offer. 

Not only did I receive the Chicken entree, but another young lady followed up and mentioned how I'm a valued customer and that they really appreciated me giving them the opportunity to make things right for me. Whoa!! I was MORE than taken care of. 

I travel a lot for work and this is my 4th time in Tempe in the last 6 months. From Orlando, Virginia, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Philadelphia and Texas to name a few places in the last few months I've never had this type of service!!! I do Trip Advisor reviews, Google reviews, Yelp and even BBB Reviews if it gets really serious and in my business as a Facilitator Consultant in Human Capital Management teaching about Branding is vital to the success on a business and personal level! They have truly branded their service in a newfound way for me. 

I will tell everyone and anyone about my experience and incorporate this scenario into my classes when training. I feel valued. I feel special and I feel like I'm more than a customer. All three people I interacted with tonight truly made my day! Shout out to Deven (my bartender)  who told me to \"Pay my Experience\" forward and I will do just that! Thanks Culinary Dropout! I won't forget how you made me feel.  

BTW: the Chicken was EVERYTHING! It was so good! I really enjoyed both plates - they were equally delicious!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is appropriately  named.  The food just wasn't that good.  Hipster service and atmosphere was great.  However, the mostly fried and over-priced food was disappointing.  The kids did love the Yard though and throwing the bean bags around.  At the end of the day though, I go to restaurants to eat."}
{"text":"The Friday night music was AWESOME!  The atmosphere was great and really a fantastic spot to bring out of town friends as we did for the overall experience.  With The Yard just walking distance from our dinner table it made for a really fun night out.  The food however was ok.  Three of us ordered salmon dishes which could have been part of it.  Maybe fish isn't what you should get when you go there but it wasn't anything over the top that I would drive back there for.  I would however go back for the experience.  I will say though the pretzels and smoky cheese fondue was my favorite part of the meal.  A must have if you are stopping.  Music, games, atmosphere were all great.  One of the people with us ordered a sandwich that looked well done but for sandwiches I'm always heading to Ike's in Mesa from now on.  Overall a fun spot with ok food."}
{"text":"Good service. Good food. Great beer choices. Want to try more menu options! They all sound great. Only complaint is the barstool was too tall for a short gal."}
{"text":"This place is great! It has a great atmosphere, attentive/friendly staff, and most importantly, awesome food! The pretzel and cheese fondue appetizer is a must! That cheese was so yummy, I couldn't stop eating it (and had to order another round because I felt bad that I ate most of it). Also, the fried chicken is probably the best fried chicken I've ever had.  Actually, scratch out \"probably\"....it definitely was!

Note that I also discovered that fried chicken and champagne compliment each other very well! Or at least at this place anyway."}
{"text":"Pretzels with the Fondue cheese sauce.... off da hook yo! This place is a killer restaurant tucked in between the coffee shop and Nobu, Don't pass it by! It is really really good. Fresh Seafood, Burgers, Curries...   It's a must have."}
{"text":"Had a lovely Caesar salad w/ shrimp and kale for lunch. It was very tasty and delish. The ambiance was awesome as well. Co-workers had the pretzel sandwich with turkey and pastrami and raved about it. The Italian grinder sandwich received a two thumbs up as well. Definitely a must try when at Hard Rock Hotel."}
{"text":"Only fun friends allowed! This is where you go if you want to share creative dishes for brunch or late night shenanigans, have drinks, play games, or just watch sports. 

Culinary Dropout is at the forefront of the next wave of American restaurants, that cross between summer backyard bbq, drinking games with your friends, mixed in with a sports bar and maybe even a live band on some nights. Kinda hard to describe it, other than to say they have it all!

There's indoor seating and covered outdoor seating. There's a mural of Amy Winehouse, Freddie Mercury and Johnny Cash done up in Mr. Brainwash style. Ping pong tables, corn hole, foosball, shuffleboard. 

Drinks:

Hijinx & Rye ($11 - Bulleit Rye, Blackberry, Jaime Torres Valencia Orange, Allspice Spritz) - Good if you like your rye with some berry fruitness. A good balance of sweet and fruity but not too too sweet and fruity. 

Grub:

House Potato Chips w/ Onion Dip ($6) - Loved the housemade potato chips, they were the perfect thickness for dipping, lightly salted. The onion dip was a little on the creamier side. It would have been perfect if it had a little more onion kick. 

Cap'n Crunch Crusted French Toast (Cereal Milk Custard, Fresh Blackberry) - Tasted great but it had the potential to be so much more. They ground up the Cap'n Crunch to powder form and then dip and coat the bread in it. It tasted like Cap'n Crunch but I think it could have been more bangin' if they sprinkled some Cap'n Crunch pieces on the top or if they imbedded some in the side of the bread before throwing it on the grill. If they didn't tell you it was Cap'n Crunch, you would not have been able to tell by just looking at it. It's dusted with powdered sugar and you get a few blackberries and syrup. 

Fried Chicken ($16 - Honey Drizzle Buttermilk Biscuit, Coleslaw, Mashed Potatoes and Gravy) - Wow! The fried chicken here is all that!!! Well seasoned, light, flaky crust with juicy chicken on the inside. Cooked perfectly! They give you three large pieces (breast, drumstick, thigh) and I could barely finish it all. The biscuit was good also, the honey drizzle is more subtle than in your face sweet, but a nice touch vs. your standard biscuit. Coleslaw was alright, mashed potatoes were alright. Get this dish either for yourself or to share!

What do I need to try next time? The Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue and the Grilled Cheese Sliders. 

They also have burgers, salads, mussels, oysters, charcuterie, cheese, ribs, fish & chips, monkey bread, sweet caramel custard and breakfast on the weekends along with other items. 

I went to the Tempe location so that crowd skews a little younger being nearby ASU. The location is huge.

I really enjoyed the vibe here. If you're looking for food and fun at moderate prices, you'll need to check out one of their locations!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Andrew, our waiter was so kind and helpful! Steve Austin \"the people's chef\" treated us like royalty! Definitely try the pork skins and the Brussel sprouts. Awesome restaurant, good atmosphere, great people! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The vibe was great, trendy and cool, but not in a trying too hard sort of way like some \"hipster\" places are. The service was outstanding - our server was very helpful and eager to offer suggestions on everything from menu items to good shopping spots in the area. I feel bad that I don't remember our server's name so I could give him a shout out, but really everyone was very helpful. There were about three different people that helped my table to varying degrees thought the evening, and all were really friendly. The food was great too, and the chef was happy to make creative off-menu accommodations for any dietary restrictions. I would definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"Very cool place, and the pretzel balls dipped in the provolone fondue lived up to every raving yelp review I read on here. I do feel that the average age was on the more late twenties range, and for our \"girls weekend\" of 21-22 year olds,  it wasn't totally the Friday night vibe we all wanted, BUT our waiter was beyond helpful & friendly to us, giving us suggestions of local places and where it would be safe for us to walk, as a group of girls, etc. he went above and beyond and for that I'm leaving this review!"}
{"text":"My friend was visiting me from out of town and wanted to do something fun for happy hour while enjoying the sunshine. We decided to swing by CD for happy hour and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The red sangria is awesome - not too sweet - the pork belly nachos, chef salad, and antipasti dishes were yummy! I forgot our server's name but she was super sweet. I'm planning to come again to try out their main dishes and check out the evening scene."}
{"text":"Love this place and there anti pasta options! We got the marcona almonds, ciabatta, truffle cheddar chips, salami and manchego. Delicious! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Can I eat here every day of my life forever? Never once been disappointed. One time my burger was a bit undercooked and they brought me out a new one with extra bacon and some extra fries. You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu"}
{"text":"Every time I come here for drinks and dinner I am more and more impressed. The service is great and the atmosphere is awesome. The live music is always so good and add so much to the experience. This place is great for a date night or dinner with friends. I recently took a group here for a bachelorette party and it was so enjoyable. They accommodated our large group effortlessly and the food was fast and delicious. I recommend the preztel balls and dip for a snack or appitizer!!"}
{"text":"The staff is very courteous and very knowledgeable regarding drink and food taste. They go so far as to compare it to things that I happen to know and love back in NYC. The Gin and tonic #33 is definitely one of the best gin and tonics I have ever consumed. The usage of uncommon gin, with a touch I haven't seen anywhere else. The precision and craft is taken to the next level. The fried chicken, I would put up to most other places I have tried throughout the country."}
{"text":"The muscles for appetizer were delish . We ordered the steak and the Korean Rib eye , both spot on and delish...I really wish they made sweet potato fries, chips , or pretty much anything ...
Our server Larissa was great , attentive very helpful with the recommendation."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming here on Saturday night. It wasn't as crowded as I expected it to be, and the drinks were top notch. The food menu on the patio where all the games were was pretty good as well. I loved the pretzels and provolone dip, but my favorite thing was the brown bag special beer. Its basically beer roulette (I peeked, sue me) and I took the better out of the bunch and gave my three amigos the others. We did this a few times, so you can imagine the hilarity after drinking craft beer for the past years and then getting a Milwaukee's Best. I like that there is a huge parking lot in the area, that makes my life a lot easier in Tempe as well as the live band."}
{"text":"I loved, loved, loved it here! We stumbled upon this place on our way over to the mall from the W hotel. One look at the menu and I was super excited to try it. Everything looked so good, I was already making plans to come back before we even ate there so I could try everything. 

We got the chips and onion dip to start. It was SOO good. We pretty much devoured it on the spot. (we were hungry). I got the smoked chicken salad (minus the Gorgonzola) and my husband got the turkey pastrami sandwich. I was excited he ordered it because it was my second choice. Both the salad and the sandwich were awesome. Usually when I ask for no cheese, somehow there is always cheese. We could see when our order was up and saw a server thoroughly inspect my salad for cheese. I was convinced they made a mistake but when the salad was brought over, behold, no cheese! In fact, the server was inspecting it to make sure there was nothing in there! 

We were too full to get dessert and never made it back there during the trip, but next time we are in town...I know where we are going!"}
{"text":"Now I understand the meaning of the restaurant name....

Disappointed with the service.... a little slow for a Monday night but still took almost an hour to get our orders.... others who arrived after us got their dinners ahead of us.  

$22 for a slice of salmon.... no sides.  The rest of the party had sides with their dishes.  Street tacos were too spicy to eat.

Not worth the prices they charge..."}
{"text":"I've been anxious to try CD since the Pink Taco departed a few years ago and Fox Restaurant Concepts put Culinary in it's place. I took my bestie here last weekend to celebrate her birthday. We got there before the 'rush' of dinner arrivees landed and scored a primo spot on the patio for good people watching.. not in the patio bar.. but just in the right spot... well, so we thot. Get to that in a bit! 
We started with catching up as we usually do and opted for mojitos...plain and simple. The waitress was a little.. hmmmm .. what should we describe her as. Well, she sat down when I was putting on a refresher of lipstick and asked me, \"Why I was putting on my lipstick?\"  (cheesy smile). I could not tell if she was being funny or patronizing me. So I came back with a .. \"Ummmmm, well, because I wanted to put my lipstick on and leave it all over the mojito glass?\" (cheesy smile.)... She laughed and took our order. Weird. But laughable. We opted for the pretzel and fondue app. Both of us had heard much ado about it on yelp, of course. And it was going by all around us... so it must be good. She asked if we had ever had it and when we said no, she asked \"What rock we had been living under\".. \" Oh just our own.. little rock in the library up the street\", I said. Really? Does this girl want to go with my wit? Or with my sarcasm? I can't tell. :-) Let me say this.. that stuff was to die for. Worth the heaven in your mouth.. worth the TWO workouts you will need after you have it! Nextly, we both ordered salads.. I ordered a chopped veggie salad and added shrimp. My bestie a greek style salad.. (the name has left me! ) with salami. Both were very good! We switched to Pinot Noir red wines. NOW comes the seating issue. Prom girls have arrived. Like about 8 of them and their 1 mom. They sat in our seats. The mom took pics in from our table. Over our food. Over our wine. Finally we give up our two seats not being used. Which was weird for the seating because its lounge type seating on the patio. After about 20 minutes of hovering , Mom departs. Our waitress did become funny and fun over weird and just hard to figure out. Overall it's a great place. But people seating behind us at the entrance on random seats. Taking our seats. That would have a been a cool thing if the waitress would have stopped that. Pricing is Fox Concept pricing. Valet your car. No way without parking across at Fashion Square and hoofing it over gonna work."}
{"text":"Bar service is bad. They don't pay attention to food pick up. Food cold. Korean rib cap was actually top sirloin. Cool place but food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our recent trip to check out the new \"Yard\" location.  I have always enjoyed culinary dropout, it is hard to keep from indulging in everything on the menu!  I always love their array of cheese and snacks to start off with, it is hard to choose between the Pretzels and the Meats and Cheeses!

I had the Italian Chopped salad and had the rest for lunch today.  Though, they really made the lettuce more of an afterthought and was less salad than I wanted.  My boyfriend had the Shrimp and Pork Belly Ramen, and said the pork belly was nothing to write home about, but good.  

The space itself is very beautiful, but we were sat in a half booth that backed up to the cornhole games, and personally, I would not want to sit there again.  Randomly having some guy yell in my ear is not what I want.  I felt that was different from the Yard in Phoenix because the dining and the games are a little further apart.

All in all though, I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The atmosphere is fun. I wasn't too sure what to expect when I walked in but this place was strongly recommended by friends. It looked like an old warehouse so I was naturally skeptical. After a few turns down a hallway I was pleasantly surprised to find a hip restaurant and bar, complete with games such as corn hole and table tennis. I ordered the MAC burger which was delicious. The soft pretzels and cheese were to die for. The kids had a blast as well and loved their chicken fingers. The whole experience was memorable and I will definitely come back when I'm in the PHX area again."}
{"text":"This is our must stop place everytime we are in Vegas.  Staff was amazing and big shout out to Gina our waitress.  She was awesome. The low stress dining is perfect.  Laid back and easy going everytime we been in.  The pretzel bites are 100% reason why we go. Every meal we have had is amazing tho.  We will be back in 6 months and will always return."}
{"text":"Hands down, A FANTASTIC DECOR & AMBIANCE. 

But I got to tell ya, the menu sucks. It's disappointing, and the flavors don't impress."}
{"text":"It looks super fun, don't get me wrong. And the food is good, don't get me wrong there either. And the service was actually quite good, so definitely don't get me wrong there. But seriously, I came here while on the Whole30 diet and went through the menu tediously before hand to see that I could eat something at this restaurant before coming. I ordered the steak and potatoes and NO WHERE on the menu does it mention cheese. No where. Additionally, when I asked the guy at the bar to please provide me with new potatoes because I am dairy free, he brought me back HALF of the potatoes that were on my plate in the first place. Really, HALF?! Maybe I'll come back when I don't have eating restrictions, but if you have any, don't come here."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout in Tempe is even cooler than the one in central Phoenix. It feels like a restaurant in an old warehouse building that you'd find back East. The food is great. But it's the atmosphere I really like. There is SPACE everywhere. High loft ceilings, used brick walls, open bars with acres of room in between tables, lots of very attractive wait-staff and 80\" flat screen TVs to watch if you're eating by yourself. This place has huge tables for large groups, small intimate settings with fire pits, and even a game toss area in back. It's the kind of hip place you feel comfortable going to if you're by yourself, young or old, or with a large group of friends. Great experience and does not feel like any other restaurant you've been to... !"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly as hell, nice spot for fam & friends to kick it and hang out! 
A bit wait? But soooo worth it, can't wait to go back!
SD definitely need a spot like this"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, tasty food and the Moscow Mules were delicious! If you are looking for a unique, appetizing venue, go here!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was pretty good, service was great, but not a huge fan of their \"36hr\" ribs.  I prefer less chew vs they have a more fight it off the bone style rub. The flavor was good, just not what I prefer."}
{"text":"The food is but its very loud and service is mediocre. Avoid on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is not worth it. Some staff are rude and inattentive, the manager is a jerk, and the food is mediocre. You have to close a tab and start a new one if you move to another table. The second, and last, time I was there someone put $36 worth of drinks on my tab. I disputed it and they removed it, although when I checked my credit card statement I discovered that they had recharged me the next day! There are so many great places to eat in Phoenix; this place is totally not worth it."}
{"text":"Great place for meeting friends for happy hour.  Sometimes it can get a bit crowded, so get there early so you can snag a couch and have fun!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning had an amazing experience. Food was great,drinks were delicious and the service was awesome! Our sever Danielle was very helpful and was great with her meal and drink suggestions! Thanks Danielle for making our experience such a great one, will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"No country for old men

Demographically I don't fit the mold.Guy over 60. Had a beer finished it,after 10 minutes finally had to grab someone for a second one. Ordering to go .We will see,I am invisible in this place."}
{"text":"I can always appreciate complementary valet. So for that alone they score high, but even better was the food. It was flavorful and right on point. My 2 starters knocked it off the park. The Goat and beets appetizer is simply exquisite. For the first time ever I'm interested in a recipe. It's nutty & sweet. The only bad thing is the quantity. They should charge more, but make it bigger for sure. The clam chowder is high up there as well. Very homey. Lots of veggies. I want to be back for the pork tacos. Or for the beets salad again.. Ok, for both then."}
{"text":"I feel like this is a place where I could hang out with my bros, i.e., if I knew any bros in Phoenix. You know what I mean by bros? Those are the dudes you chill with as you down pints and swap stories about the ladies, man. But I was recently in Phoenix for a business trip, and this cavernous place was the chosen location for our pre-offsite team dinner where we were supposed to bond and talk shop. So no bro talk...and someone would have had to teach me how to talk like a bro anyway. Old dog, untrainable. The proprietors appear to be attracting party-hardy types, the kind who leave big tips without calculating the percentages, as well as big families with kids who like to run around among strangers.

This was a huge space at 53,000 square feet, a lot of it taken up by covered patio seating, ping-pong tables, foosball tables, and corn-hole tosses. Fun for the kiddies but pretty much taken over by the bros. I met my colleagues at the mammoth bar where they had beer on tap for days (photo: http://bit.ly/2nF78og). It was Happy Hour, so I took advantage and ordered a $4 Sangria which was refreshing no matter how you slice the lime (photo: http://bit.ly/2FOPncB). A couple of us ordered the $7 Antipasti Plate, a generous portion of Kalamata olives, balsamic-drenched asparagus spears, peppers, prosciutto, honey almonds, cheese toast, breadsticks, and Parmesan cheese wedges (photo: http://bit.ly/2FNfRes). Tasty treats abound.

When the rest of my team arrived, we were seated at a table that appeared to be in the middle of all the activity going on in the restaurant. I behaved and ordered the $16 Kale Salad with big slices of grilled chicken breast, heirloom tomatoes, avocado, asparagus, pine nuts, and Parmesan cheese. I had them put the lemon tahini vinaigrette on the side, a good thing since it turned out to be quite a creamy concoction (photo: http://bit.ly/2E5fD6l). It was TGIF-good but little more. Ready for a band to play, there was a small stage at the back of the main brick wall with a big sign that said \"Four Wheels Move Your Body But Two Wheels Move Your Soul\", a shoutout to the badass bikers since the building was once a motorcycle garage (photo: http://bit.ly/2E8mx6J).

FOOD - 3 stars...the bar bites are familiar but decently satisfying
AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a whole lotta space if you need it
SERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty good given the number of people flooding into the place
TOTAL - 3 stars...I kinda get why it's called Culinary Dropout"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and they have a large brew menu and cocktail menu. Deffamt would come back again. 
I had the turkey pastrami and my date had the Kale garden salad. They were excellent and a great recomindation by the waitress."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!!  Took my family here (so wasn't cheap for 4 people) and we were all thrilled with the experience.  We had to eat outside as they were all booked up for the entire evening. So if you plan on trying this place on a weekend...reserve your table a few days ahead. Sitting outside was made tolerable with their misters.  It was actually nice being outside as the live blues music going on inside would have been a little overwhelming.  If you're not into screaming over live music while you're dining out...eat outside or come before the music starts.  We shared the pretzels with cheese fondue...and I would have been happy just ordering more of that for dinner.  It was a near religious experience.  They had a nice (but smallish) selection of some craft beers and I had a nice IPA to go with it.  

My daughter ordered the pork belly nachos...I'm pretty sure they used the same cheese fondue on them...delicious.  they should just put that stuff on everything...even dessert.
I had the fried chicken.  It was actually the least amazing dish out of the others.  Very good, but I just liked the other stuff better.  
My son got the ribeye cap...melted in your mouth.  Yeah I had dinner envy at this time...I choose...poorly.  
My wife got the sweet corn ravioli.  Not like any ravioli you've tried.  Very different...in a good way.  
For dessert we split the banana creme pie and the bread pudding.  Both were exceptional.  

You get smallish portions here.  This is a good thing.  It allows you to try a lot more of what they have to offer, and I believe they are appropriately priced for quality and portion size.  It's great to be able to split an appetizer, enjoy your entree, and still have a little room for dessert without risk to permanent bodily injury.  

I will definitely be back when I visit the great state of Arizona again."}
{"text":"Apple monkey breadddd. Pretzels and cheese. pub burger. mac burger.

Oh my god I love this place.

It may be weird how often I go.

However, if you are in the Phoenix Metro Area - it is a must. 

Although I rave about the food, the atmosphere is what drew me in. It's amazing! There's chandeliers and exuberant chairs, but then our napkins are dishtowels and common dress is jeans and flip flops. The whole place is an oxymoron. I adore it.

Oh and the service is amazing too. (FYI)"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken around!  The pretzels with cheese fondue dip is a must have.  Had a wonderful ravioli for dinner with shrimp added.  Wonderful flavor...great service...excellent staff.  I have been to several of their restaurants and so far, I have never been disappointed.  Casual, fun atmosphere, with a hip vibe."}
{"text":"Good place to come eat while shopping, nice outdoor patio and bar. If not crowded, just do it!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  the food is good, but the menu doesn't WoW me.  It's standard stuff.  

The staff however is really accomodating!"}
{"text":"This place takes the typical pub food but takes it to culinary genious. The pretzels and fondue are amazing. All the food is pretty good and the prices are what you would expect for a higher class establishment. Valet parking is free which is a nice perk. They also have games inside. Come on down and enjoy where the hipsters hangout. They know good food when they see it."}
{"text":"Would have stopped into Culinarily Dropout at the Yard on Sunday.  Was put off by the Complementary Valet car parking.  Not much onstreet parking nearby due to Resident only parking in the surrounding streets.  How about just opening up their parking lot to park in as provided by most businesses?   Pretty simple fix.  Thanks."}
{"text":"I come here for the atmosphere and the pretzel fondue! Culinary is right in the middle of things in Scottsdale and it is a fun atmosphere for drinks/dinner before a night out on the town. It is trendy, upbeat and has live music on weekends, which can also make it pretty loud. 

The food is pretty good too, but not a ton of options for those (like me) who don't eat meat. I have never come here and not started with the pretzel fondue (they're amazing) and my go to menu item is usually the Ahi Salad."}
{"text":"Attended for Restaurant Week for the first time and enjoyed everything, from the decadent  yet relaxing decor, to the atmosphere, food, drink and attractive wait staff. I started off with a red wine spritzer, a first and oh so tasty, the antipasti appetizer plate, which was simply scrumptious! For dinner I had the rainbow trout with green beans and toasted almonds, which was so delicious I ate every bite and for dessert the carrot cake. I was too full to eat it, but had to try a bite to make sure the trifecta was complete. Everything exceeded expectations and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I was with friends who ordered before I was able to be seated. There ended up being such a plethora of food that I didn't need order! I tried the hummus: probably some of the best hummus I've ever had. I had a bite of the 36 hour pork ribs, and they were fell off the bone tender, with amazing flavor. The roasted salmon was creamy and delicious. The steak and potatoes were awesome as well. For dessert, we all chowed down on the caramel corn and the monkey bread. YOU HAVE TO TRY THE MONKEY BREAD!!!!!
The second time I went there I had the sweet corn cannelloni with grilled chicken on top. The cannelloni is a great vegan option, I just added the grilled chicken for added protein. Oh, and of course we had monkey bread. It's addictive!
Everything I've eaten and drank here is great. They need to come to Virginia and open one up!"}
{"text":"Thursday night from hell!!!! 

Good food, but last Thursday night 3/15/18 was the most awful experience I ever put up with of a restaurant staff and ownership (no joke). My parents, my uncle, and my great aunt (89years old) were in town, I thought I'd take them somewhere new and delicious that they haven't been too before. First off the first 20minutes were fantastic....until we had a live band playing. Totally fine! What went wrong was, the level of music was incredibly too high/loud for the entire inside. My parents and myself were so upset with the 3 TIMES WE ASKED OUT WAITRESS TO LOWER THE MUSIC (she'd come back and tell us whoever or if she did that you couldn't). My father is in the military and the level of sound in your restaurant was unsafe, no one would hear an emergency (if there was one). The band should of played on the patio or lower the music for the small dining area inside. We won't be back because it was entirely too loud to hear or try to carry on a conversation with family. And how rude to do that when spring training is going on or spring break with people are visiting and obliviously eating."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service looked to be bad at first but got better. Great selections of beers. Probably be back even though we don't live in area."}
{"text":"I have been here three times (last time was Jan 10th) and every time gets better!  I have had half of the menu already.  Top three must haves #1 Pretzel bites with cheese sauce, #2 Pork Belly anything, #3 Ramen bowl.   Go on Sundays for the half off specials!  

The ambiance and trendy lighting make it very hipster and I love the family atmosphere on Sundays with the outdoor games.   I'd probably have a wedding reception here.  It's really nice."}
{"text":"This place is very eccentric. The atmosphere is very cool and upbeat. The staff I personally dealt with were nice and friendly. The food was good and the drinks were good as well. It was a place to go to have a great time with friends. They have plenty of seating, though we could not understand why there wasn't any type of fan or cooling mechanism on the side we were on near the near the gaming area. It would have been great aside from that. Living in Az there should be something in place for cooling the customers during the summer. I would definitely go back but will make sure to make a reservation ahead of time to sit inside where the air is."}
{"text":"Great atmoshpere, drinks are no lite ;) which is great. Got the pastrami turkey which was delish, and pretzel fondue yum...that is a meal in itself!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, but food was not that great especially for the price. The location is amazing though and you can eat/drink right by the main pool which is perfect."}
{"text":"Hubby and I recently visited Scottsdale for a brief weekend getaway and based on reviews here on Yelp decided to go to Culinary Dropout for dinner on a Saturday night.  I knew based on reviews here that it would be a cluster bleep on a Saturday and it was but thanks to the dedicated Yelpers I wasn't shocked by that.

We arrived around 7:45 and of course the place was elbows to assholes as expected.  But yay...we must be living right because we had no sooner given our names to the hostess for the 1 hour long wait and stepped towards the bar to try and elbow our way in to try and get some alcoholic relaxation when 2 folks got up from their seats at the bar, hell yeah, we sat down and proceeded to imbibe while waiting for our table.  Thank you God.

Finally, 2 glasses of wine later (in my world that equates a little over an hour, you mean people actually keep time in minutes, for me I keep time by the number of glasses of wine I can consume!!!!!)

Pager finally goes off, go to our table, (place BTW is coolly decorated----green chandeliers....purple fabric on walls...overly hip, you get the idea right?  You wouldn't decorate your Mom and Dad's dining room this way, but hey, that is why we go out right?  To see how uncool and dorky we really are.)

Once seated order MORE ALCOHOL FIRST, that is always a must, forget the fact you just received at the bar a glass of wine and a beer that you haven't even touched, ORDER MORE BOOZE-guys, it's not my rule, it is what it is.  Then ordered the pretzel balls and fondue.  It arrived promptly was was delicious.  The hype about this appie is true.  It truly is yummy.

Hubs loves chicken (fried of course, if it has the skin and bones removed and is baked and healthy forget it.  It has to be in GREASE and dredged with all kinds of artery clogging breading or in his world it doesn't exist).  Me, don't really know where my brain was (how many glasses of wine are we into now.....oops not quite sure now) but I ordered the Stroganoff over the Meatloaf.

The cute pretty server informs the hubby that they are out of white meat, understandable, by this time it is approaching 9:00 on a Saturday night and the place is a total cluster but hubs ain't too thrilled.  He does have his standards, 
GREASE=GOOD, BREADING=GOOD, DARK MEAT=NO WAY JOSE.  He asked if there was anyway he could at least get one piece of white meat.  This is very cool, the server went back to the kitchen and the chef himself came out and talked to hubby and assured him he would give him the last breast.  Don't know if it was actually THE LAST BREAST or if they were holding out, but it was cool that he took the time on a busy Saturday night to come out and speak to us and provide the exalted white meat for hubby.

Food arrived and was good.  However, to me Stroganoff should have sour cream to make it creamy and this had none, it tasted really nice but wish I would have gone with the meatloaf now.  Hubby enjoyed the chicken.

There was live music, think Mumford and Son's, and we had fun.  Only negative, if you want a romantic intimate dinner forget this place on a Saturday night.  It was noisy, loud and cramped.  But a cool space none the less."}
{"text":"First time attending this location. I didn't know what to expect going in, but I was presently surprised. We were seated outside in the covered patio area. They have ping pong, corn hole, and other games to enjoy while dining. The area was spacious and lots of room to move around. Great atmosphere, this would be a great venue for a team building event as well. I had the wings and what great flavor, I also had the kale salad with smoked salmon. The menu had lots of good choices to choose from and reasonably priced.  The service was awesome and I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is a welcome addition to the Vegas Strip scene, by offering inventive gastropub type food, an awesome beer list, and a fun vibe with reasonable prices for being inside the Hard Rock. On my first visit I ordered my go-to, a Rogue Dead Guy, and the Steamed Mussels which were AWESOME. The portion was much bigger than expected, and the broth was flavorful and packed with herbs and chorizo, accompanied with a side of toasted bread for dipping. 

I took some friends from out of town here last weekend, thinking we could get some good food in a fun place that wouldn't break the bank. I was nervous in reserving a table for 8 at the last minute, but upon walking in at 9:15pm, I noticed that there was hardly anyone there, much like my first visit. The restaurant is huge, with a large outdoor space, but I don't know why there is never anyone there! Our server was awesome and so friendly and patient with a bunch of hooligans at the table, I regret not being able to remember his name. 

My friend and I shared the pretzel bites and provolone fondue which were fun, and generously sized. The pretzel bites were soft and warm, I think our table ordered 4 orders, they were that popular! We also split the buffalo chicken meatballs which I wasn't a huge fan of, they were slightly tough and dry. The smoked salmon salad was more like cooked salmon that had been infused with a smoky flavor, versus cured, smoked, salmon aka lox. It was still good, and came with some melba toast type crackers for spreading, but wasn't entirely what I envisioned. 

Given the size of the venue, the huge stage available for live music, and the patio, there is so much potential for an awesome dinner/drinks experience. Book bands! Do beer tastings! Pingpong outside?"}
{"text":"Super fun,  a modern themed culinary pub. Steak Tacos rocked, beverage in a bag is their claim to fame. Live music on the weekends,  draws a large crowd, so get there early to dine, then enjoy the music. 

Try the monkey bread,  and lose your head.


Convenient free parking garage entrance, right beside the location."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this location at all. The concept is great, but the experience was less than. We waited TWO hours for a table after being told that the wait was 60-90min. The menu was small, but everything sounded great. I ordered an antipasti appetizer and the sweet potato kale salad. The appetizer was soooo small and way overpriced for what we got. The salad, which I imagined being a healthy serving of kale topped with radishes and sweet potato (from the menu description), was tiny and the \"sweet potato\" was literally potato peeling shaving as a garnish. I was not expecting to pay $12 for a bowl of lettuce and a few pieces of kale. The other dish we ordered was the turkey pastrami, which was okay, but the fries were luke warm. After just two beers and the above food items we ended up paying almost $70 for a dinner that could have been made at home for under $20. I say don't waste your time or money going here unless its happy hour and not packed."}
{"text":"Tried it for AZ Restaurant Week - SIMPLY AWESOME!!! - there were 2 couples so we got to try a bunch of stuff.  The Antipasti plate usually isn't my thing but I tried it and everything was wonderful!  Also tried the pretzels and cheese which are legendary! The prime rib dip which I ordered was excellent and I heard good things about salmon and chicken too...  for dessert I had the pie which was great but I got to try my wife's Caramel Corn topped Custard OMG There are no words!!! You just have to try it!  At $44 per couple I declare Culinary Dropout \"Winner of Restaurant Week\""}
{"text":"When visiting Tempe and we saw this place on Yelp and wanted to try it. First impression on walking was amazement at the size of the place! 
The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is that there was a 45 minute to and an hour long wait to be seated and it was pretty loud. 
With that being said, we weren't in a rush and enjoyed the fun and hip atmosphere! There are also yard games - corn hole, ping pong, etc. that you could play while you wait! If you don't like to wait, I would recommend making a reservation or coming early! 
The food was delicious and probably one of the best meals I had while visiting Tempe! I had the Kale salad, my husband had the Turkey Rueben, and our friend had the corn ravioli! So good! 
If you like great food, a fun atmosphere, and tasty drinks then this is the place for you!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Daniel the manager is Simply Amazing. I traveled from another state craving my happy hour favorite. I did not know it was not a regular menu item on the weekends. Feeling very disappointed and not hungry anymore, he went in the kitchen himself and made it for me.!!!!!!!! Words can't express how excited I was. He is the best! I come to Vegas just for Culinary Dropouts food.  Best food in Town hands down..... 

Thank you Daniel from the bottom of my heart for going above and beyond for me. Forever a loyal customer. You deserve a raise and a promotion!!!! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great place for a weekend hangout. Very lively and positive atmosphere with games and a live band it was the perfect spot for a fun night out with fiends."}
{"text":"I ate at the culinary dropout last night and I will totally come back! The restaurant has a great modern atmosphere and live music 3 times a week. I ordered the butternut squash cannelloni and I was very happy with my decision. It was filling but not too heavy and the butternut squash was a sweet alternative to traditional cheese. The staff was very helpful and polite. Overall, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I've been a number of times and the food and service have always been great. The pretzel fondue and the Capt Crunch French toast are really good. Also the patio has a great view of the ReHab pool. It's a bit pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"$63.78 for 2 cocktails 2 appetizers and 1 dessert.

Would be fair if there was an entree or 2 in there but all we had were appetizers. The food was fair but not great. The monkey bread dessert was good and the \"After School Special\" drink tasty but not worth the over priced bill.

Do yourself a favor and go to Mr.Luckys next door. Ask about the 7.77 special thats not on the menu."}
{"text":"Should be 0 stars but no choice. Went with party of 3, slow on drinks, understaffed. Ordered entrees 45 minutes later told they were sold out of steak!?? No charge for drinks left hungry. Had to complain to Hard Rock management to get $50 food credit."}
{"text":"Sam Fox has done it again, but in a hip grungy kind of way! But then again anything is better then the douche Nic Richie's Pink Taco that occupied the space in the past.  I had a idea of what I was in store before walking in and was surprised upon arriving. The first thing I noticed was the crowd. Not your typical Scottsdale fucks. Kind of a CenPho meets tempe and have kids type of people. I didnt see a single guy wearing a bedazzled foil shirt. The second thing I noticed was the music. Band Of Horses, Queen, Nirvana, and other great bands hitting my ears at the perfect volume. Am I dead, cause this is heaven. Oh wait...I'm going to hell. Better company down there. Since they don't take reservations, which I think is a Fox Concept Restaurants thing, they gave me a buzzer. It was a bit applebees'ish. While waiting, I read off some trivia questions to my friends. After a 10 min wait we were seated. We instantly turned to the booze menu and ordered quickly. I was thirsty.  The second I saw the Smashed Irishman cocktail, I knew I had to have it. This was the best beverage that has ever touched these beautiful lips. I wanted to put my dick in it; I wanted it's dick in me. We decided to opt for dessert instead of a app and it was a wise decision. I ordered the Pub Burger. It was damn good but not the best I've had. Now back to the dessert. We got the Monkey Bread and holy shit...foodgasm! I'm not a huge sweets guy but I'd bathe in this shit! It was warm gooie goodness with its bestfriend of ice cream keeping it company. After all this you would think I'd be 'unbutton your pants' full, but not the case. I felt perfect. Then the bill came and I felt even better. Great food for a stupid low price. I cannot praise Sam Fox enough and Culinary Dropout jumps to my favorite in his line of restaurants"}
{"text":"For a brand new, only been open for 2 weeks venue we were really impressed. I'm confident this place will easily be 5 stars and a favorite hang out of ours. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the food was all quite a bit over salted and they reeeeally need to work out a better parking situation. Again, minor kinks to be worked out.

We arrived around 2:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon before going to the Sun's game downtown. The very small parking lot was packed and \"Valet Only\" the surrounding streets were neighborhoods and cars were parked in front of houses for blocks. If I lived in one of those houses I would be pretty pissed every Friday and Saturday night.

We almost left because we thought the place would be over crowded but decided to give it a try. The inside of the restaurant was decent sized and had a very comfortable and inviting vibe. The patio was ginormous to quote Will Ferrel and lavishly decorated with plush green couches and large wing backed chairs. Large light bulbs were strewn across the covered patio along with pretty chic chandeliers making for a lovely lit canopy in the evenings. Casual? Yes, you can wear jeans here but don't mistake this place for a trendy, of the moment venue were the patrons are dressed in their very best wanna be Scottsdale attire.

Enough with the decor (Oh, but I didn't mention the bathroom shocker.......) 

We were there in the early afternoon, it was busy but we were seated outside promptly.  I ordered 2 appetizers, the \"Grilled Artichoke with Lemon Aioli Sauce\" and the \"12 Hour Slow Roasted Tomatoes\".  My husband orderd the Fish and Chips with Cole Slaw.  The artichoke was grilled perfectly, charred in all the right places with a hint of smokiness and not to oily. The lemon aioli was divine. There was a bit too much salt which would have been fine if all the other food wasn't over salted as well. The tomatoes were Roma style and served whole and cold which I wasn't prepared for. They were a nice accompaniment to my artichoke but were all-in-all over glorified canned tomatoes. My husbands fish and chips had a smoked flavor which was wonderful and the fish was cooked perfectly and fell apart nicely and was moist and flavorful again, a bit over salted but still good, all the more reason to order another beer.

Our waitress was very friendly, helpful and prompt!"}
{"text":"9/26/15 - So last night we enjoyed another evening at Culinary Dropout in Tempe. This follows a bad experience we had there a few weeks ago and and I must say they did a great job. The food was great, the service was excellent and a we were indoors (Yay!). A shout out to our server Joey - he's the best, as well as manager Samantha. Thanks for a fun evening, I'm sure we will be back. I updated my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I came here with a Bachelorette Party last weekend. We put our name on the list and the hostess said it would be 15-30 minute wait for a table for 8. it ended up taking over an hour. We were given complimentary pretzel balls and fondue at our table as an apology for the long wait. The pretzel and fondue dish was delicious! definitely one of the best things we had on the table the entire night. 
I ordered the salmon which was ok but the portion was very small. Someone ordered the gnocchi which was not good. The cannelloni was good but the portion was small...again. The salads were large and very good. To sum up the food, it was OK but not great and we were all still hungry after we left the restaurant.
The music playing was also extremely loud. You can barely have a conversation in the place. We were very happy when the live music started. It was a nice touch and the band was very good.
The ambiance is OK. Beautiful long tables and leather couches and gorgeous chandeliers. 
I hate giving this place a bad review, but I would never spend $$$ to eat here again."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places. The outdoor patio is amazing. Fire pits, ping pong, corn hole and a ton of tv with sports. Food is amazing. It is not sport bar food. I ate the ribs and would order them again. My wife had the chicken salad.  The next family gathering will be here."}
{"text":"This was my second time here, and yet again I wasn't disappointed. We were looking for entrees to share, and decided to go with the fried chicken and beer battered fish. The portions were generous and the food tasted great. We also tried their Irish whiskey dropout called the \"Smashed Irishman\", and it tasted amazing as well. As far as price goes, this place is not amongst the cheapest, but I would say it's worth the money. Their gaming area could use some improvement though, the ping pong balls and racquets certainly need to be replaced with newer ones. But overall, it was a great experience! :-)"}
{"text":"Not a disappointment.  I remembered the 1st time I came here I didn't think it was awesome but I remember it being good.  If I had remembered it being this good, I would've come back here several times last week.  
We sat at the bar and shared a few things - 
I ordered the Moscow Mule at the bartender's suggestion and it was super tasty and the ginger root was fresh.  
Bread & olive oil - served warm & nicely seasoned
Chef's salad - nice balance of dressing 
Short rib pasta - another recommendation - I thought it was good but it didn't knock my socks off
Salted Caramel Custard - last recommendation - one well made!"}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT
Located off the main floor of the Hard Rock, this restaurant is easy to find and surprisingly large. There's both indoor and outdoor seating, which is practically pool side. Most seats have a view of the pool area, which is great for people watching. 

Came here around brunch time on Sunday with no wait and lots of open seats.

APPS
Soft Pretzel Fondue - Exactly what it sounds like. YES!

SALADS
Kale and Corn  + Chicken - surprisingly filling. I didn't even finish it."}
{"text":"Delicious, great service, wide variety of options! Have brought so many visitors here!"}
{"text":"I am not sure if I would go so far as to say they are \"breaking all the rules\" it seems like the typical trendy gastropub atmosphere.  However the pretzels and provolone fondue will be recommended by me if ever I hear of anyone going here or if I ever come here again. My table had mixed reviews on the food. Everyone agreed on the pretzels and the burrata. The salads were only ok and the Brussels sprouts were good but not great. My friend did not like her chicken meatballs although I thought they were ok. I had the fried chicken and I was the envy of the table. It was crispy and very hot when it arrived. I thought it was good but very oily. Back to yardbird for me for fried chicken.  I would come here again and try something else.... And the pretzels."}
{"text":"Trendy and comfortable decorations. Flavorful food with quality ingredients. Excellent service despite being busy. Well designed menu with good selections and some interesting items.

I love the tomato appetizer best. The tomatoes are amazing."}
{"text":"Had such a blast here this past week! There was a big group of us (8) and we were all very well taken care of. Our waiter was awesome and even stood on a chair to get our picture!! we also really enjoyed the outdoor game area, definitely a fun and unique atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say about the awesome experience my wife and I had at the Tempe location. We had reservations for 630pm. Unfortunately the place was a super zoo for some reason... on a Tuesday night and we didn't get seated for another 20 minutes. The manager and the staff were super apologetic because of the wait. We love CD and have been to the Scottsdale and downtown locations.  I must say the service and attention to detail in light of the messed up reservation was well above my expectations. This location is truly the best of the local, in my opinion. Thank you Clancy for taking care of us. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Brought the fam for an early dinner and we had a good time. 
I had: fried chicken entree 
Hubby: Korean beef entree
4 yr old: buttered noodles w/fries

Well we all finished our plates! We enjoyed our food so we will be back for sure. This time though I might have to bring my own hot sauce since their only options are tobacco cholula and sriracha, & you just Can't have fried chicken and Not have Louisiana hot sauce!! So that was disappointing but the chicken was still delicious. The batter is slightly sweet & im not a big fan of sweet entrees but this was subtle and the chicken was tender & juicy so I have to say that I liked it more than LoLo's. Which I'm sure is a big statement for some people. Lol my biscuit Was (I capitalize because I ate that $hit up!) fluffy, buttery, & sweet. 
4 year old daughter ate everything up which is rare so we are happy that money wasn't wasted! Shell type of noodles, a pretty good serving size & Parmesan was easy to eat. 
Hubby says his plate was amazingly tasty. Period. He was satisfied so overall we had a great experience. 
Service was good. He (Conner) had quite a few tables so I just had to make sure not to forget anything when he did come around."}
{"text":"as recommended by many on Yelp we tried the soft pretzels fondue... and it was a success!  definitely need to limit yourself so you don't get too full before your meal.

the menu has a little bit of everything, but not overwhelming. the only hard thing is deciding what sounds better!
we tried the pastrami sandwich and the chef salad. both are DELISH! I'm not a big pastrami person because it has a distinct taste to it, but this one was definitely an exception. it wasn't dry and it didn't have a weird after taste. it had you wanting more.

the chef salad that was recommended by our waitress & it was definitely a great choice. it wasn't the usual boring chef salad - the taste was different & the dressing didn't taste store bought.... i could be wrong....but the ingredients all together worked perfectly. the quality of the ingredients made a difference.
I'm a carboholic - and the sandwich was definitely worth having, but i think the salad for me is worth having again.

we'll be back and our next objective is to tackle the fried chicken.... until next time culinary dropout, until next time...."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is rad. I really like this place. I've only been there once so far, but I can't wait to go back! The ambiance is crazy cool. The service was friendly and helpful. The French Dip type sandwich I ordered was melt-in-your-mouth amazing. The fries were utterly addictive (*drool). They have this Paper Bag Beer special that's pretty cool too; it's a cheap beer (PBR or another of their choice) that they'll serve to you in a paper bag (at a cheap price). Love it, haha! I also snacked on these pretzel bites that you dip in fondue cheese; those were really good too. I'm certain Culinary Dropout has 5 Star potential, so I'm really looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"I go to the Hard Rock almost every time I'm in Vegas and it feels like this spot is a different restaurant each time I'm there. Finally they put a restaurant there that's reasonably priced and the food is amazing. We went on Saturday during brunch and their capn crunch french toast is really good. I hope they are still there next time I go to Vegas so that I can try their other menu items and they cocktails because everything sounded so good."}
{"text":"A few folks fromwork had gone to cul.d.o. and raved about how fab it was ....so I went for lunch today i sat at the bar which is my m.o. I was greeted by a very lovely young lady bartender I ordered the fish and chips which i heard were great and the bar tender confirmed that . i will say the fish was decent  but  the chips(fries) were soggy and greesy and not that warm. I will probley go back for a 2nd try update to follow"}
{"text":"Food is subpar.  Everything seemed to lack flavor. I LOVE pretzels with cheese. Theirs wasn't great. Honestly, the cheese I get out of a can is more flavorful. Mussels were pretty good. The 36 hour rib thing was okay. Not a lot of meat, but lots of sauce coating it.  Service was great and the place was cute but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Hip little hangout near Mill. The food is unique and delicious. The \"Ma...The Meatloaf\" is absolutely amazing. I truly enjoyed the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"From 5/20/16

We stumbled into Culinary Dropout after a show at Vinyl looking for a good meal to soak up all the alcohol we consumed. 

We were seated, the guy who brought us to our table was really friendly plus hilarious, and so was our server. 
The ambience here was nice, they had an open patio where you could see the outside while eating, which was offered up if we wanted to sit there, but since it was a windy Vegas night we declined.

We ordered our food I got the Burger. It was so good; the portions were decent as well.
I will come back and try their other dishes next time we're at the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"The food here is superb. It's become impossible for us to go here and not order the pretzel bites. They're perfect. Everything else on the menu has been great as well from the bistro steak to the salmon. I love the layout as well. It can be loud when it gets later so it's not the best if you want a quiet dinner, but that doesn't bother me at all."}
{"text":"Our Uber driver steered us in the right direction on this one...We sat on the patio and were quite comfortable with the heaters fired up.  Our meal began with an order of wings, which had a nice bit of heat.  I had the Korean Style Ribeye Cap, which was delightfully spicy and cooked perfectly to medium rare.  My dining companions had the fried chicken, which they described as having a lovely sweetness to it and the Pub Burger, which was very good as well.  We are from NC, so us being happy with fried chicken in Arizona is kind of a big deal.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  We left full and happy!"}
{"text":"Eh.
It was ok.

Just ok though.

I was hoping for a bit more WOW with my seared tuna salad.  
Meh.

I'll come back, as some of the other things on the menu sounded worthwhile."}
{"text":"I actually have returned to Culinary Drop out and their food has improved a bit. They gave more Pretzel nuggets for their Pretzel Fondue. I talked to one of the managers, and she said that they're still trying to improve on some things. 

During our second visit my friends and I tried the Black Mussels, the ribs, the MAC burger, the gnocchi, and the the Salted Caramel Pots De Creme. They were all so tasty. My only complaint was that the gnocchi was not that filling."}
{"text":"I have driven by Culinary Dropout (aka The Yard) multiple times and it has always piqued my interest. Finally, after many random drive-bys, I stopped by for a drink and a bite to eat. 

Completely blown away by the interior set up and design. The actual entrance is connected to a small boutique called Madison's--super expensive clothing with simple athleisuere style. (While the clothes are cute, I don't think I can pay $58 for a tank). Anyway, follow the hallway to find a corridor that leads you to an open, transparent kitchen and a cool, upscale restaurant. Completely open concept, industrial, and artsy. 

Patrons were young business professionals, older important people in suits, families brunching together, and then me...day drinking on my day off with messy hair. This is definitely not the bar or restaurant you go to for cheap drinks to find life's answers at the bottom of the bottle. It definitely has a classy feel. 

Stage in the restaurant has live music with the upcoming acts listed on the giant blackboard. The Yard is connected and is the gaming area. 21 and over only in that section.

Service was good. Food was good, drink menu was awesome! Prices were decent, but on the higher side overall. Definitely recommend this place to impress a date or a fun girls night out when you're in the mood to get dolled up."}
{"text":"I've been to Culinary Dropout a handful of times and always have a great experience! The pretzel bites are SO great, always a hit. Their cocktails seem to be overall pretty good but typically I get the sangria. I live the ambience and the hint of rock n roll/ grunge in the decor. Staff is very friendly... can be challenging to figure out who works there as there is no uniform but if you see someone who is stylish and attractive chances are they do"}
{"text":"Cool place. Food was good. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food, cold beer and fun games to play while you wait.  This funky restaurant is a new find for our family.  We got there and had to park in the complimentary valet (no big deal).  We were seated immediately, although it seemed busy.  Ordered drinks and apps.  Took the kids to play corn hole in their game area.  They have ping pong, foos ball and corn hole, just check out equip. with ID. Food was ready, went back and had a great seared tuna salad.  Ami had a Cobb salad and my mom had a good looking meat loaf sandwich.  All in all a great place.  Will definitely go back when in the area!"}
{"text":"I have herd about this place for so long but never went I finally decided to give it a try it's located inside the hard rock casino by nobu .....

I sat at the bar to take advantage of the happy hour I mean why not lol I was greeted right away and ordered a white sangria it was pretty tasty course I've had better 

I love oysters so I ordered half a dozen :) they came out pretty quickly .... they came in a small little
Dish which wasn't totally my favorite when I kept trying to put the empty shells back down but hey not really a big deal they were fresh and sweet just perfect no complaints 

I ordered there salad of the day off the happy hour menu and there pirogies cheese and potato  

I didn't like the salad at all but I'm not a huge kale person but they nicely took it off the bill for me which was very nice of them and appreciated 

The potato and cheese perogies were delicious though :) I fairly enjoy them 

I would definitely come back here again to eat check out some more stuff on the menu I got full so I couldn't explore that much but I will return"}
{"text":"Ehh.......first impression......not impressed.
I won a $25 gift card at work, that's why Im here.

$10 tiny apps.
$7 beers.
Irritated bartender that a couple of 40 somethings were sitting at his bar. 
Oh, a $2 beer in a bag?  Sounds fun....let's try it.
Then charge me $3.50 for it at the end.  Pffffftttttt.
It came out of your tip Chance or what ever your name is."}
{"text":"Very creative menu with options to please everyone! We were very happy with our meal and our service. Huge open space with plenty of seating options. We started with the BBQ Pork Belly Nachos which were to die for! The cheese on those nachos was incredibly memorable and when we inquired were told it's also the same cheese heaven they use for the pretzel fondue which we will try on our next visit. The fried chicken was served with mashed potatoes and gravy and coleslaw. The ribs were fall off the bone tender and the Pub burger was cooked to perfection. Definitely will be back not just for the food but for the level of service that we received from the moment we walked in the door. The hostess, the server, the manager, the random guy who walked by...everyone was so nice and happy to be there working on a beautiful sunny day! Can't wait to go back for those pretzel bites with cheese."}
{"text":"The food here is sooooo good, I highly recomend the experience of this place, very high energy, expect to talk really loudly to the people you're with, its loud"}
{"text":"So we went on a Friday night and their valet service sucked! Awful.

The hostess uses text messaging to tell you if your table is ready which is an excellent option, and one more places should use.

There was about an hour wait for a table so we went back to the bar in the cube, and service was slow until a guy named Matt came and took our order and was easily the high point of the nite. 

If you see a happy bartender with a bushy beard, and he is taking care of you, you will know you are in good hands.

We didn't get service from a server, but our busboy went out of his way to keep our water filled and empty glasses and coors lites off the table, which in some places is a forgotten art but not here.

Our bartender Matt recommended the turkey sammich which was great, the Thai wings and nachos were also good. 

In conclusion, I walked in with a real shitty opinion of the place because of their valet service, and left knowing Matt the best employee in the building, and California the busboy and they made up for everything and then some."}
{"text":"Was lucky to be able to attend a Pre-Opening event supporting our Local Boys & Girls Club. 
Props to the management for:
What seemed like a well trained and knowledgeable staff
Having the staff try everything on the menu so they could recommend knowledgeably (as told by the waitress)
Supporting a GREAT local charity to build brand awareness prior to opening.

We tried the pretzels. They were good but I would have preferred a smaller bite (hard not to double dip being that large) and not sure I fancy provolone. We asked for mustard.
We shared the fried chicken and the Beef Stroganoff.  The coleslaw on the chicken plate was surprisingly scrumptious. 
We had a amazing peanut Butter & Chocolate tar with fresh cream
Oh and their Coffee (passport organic we were told) was very yummy.

Cool vibe, great music, great décor, great staff and fun place. Not sure if the food tickled my taste buds enough to return but if I had a lot of younger friends to entertain I might consider taking them there."}
{"text":"Went here and food was good.... I had the deviled eggs which was ok..... My best friend and I shared a plate of ribs and plate of fried chicken..... Both were great. The fried chicken was the star. We sat outside and that was nice but the cushions were not as clean as I would have liked that is my only real complaint. Great lunch spot"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Well, it is in the Hard ROCK Hotel, but that aside, cool vibe, really fab furnishings and decor, and an outdoor patio that is poolside.  The food is unique.  I had the prime rib french dip with fries, and the fries were not hot, which was a bit disappointing, but there were homemade and I found that they were just as delicious.  The sandwich was well flavored, on housemade bread, crusty-chewy, just right.  

We also returned here the next night to check out the libations and live band.  Truly fun establishment off the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"I came here for a lunch meeting and this place is definitely a cool place for happy hour.  The wait staff was wonderful and very informative.  The place was clean with a very positive vibe.  

I ordered the Fish and Chips and it came with a side of cole slaw.  When I see the fish and chips resting on with the pool of grease, it definitely turns me off.  It was still tasty once I peeled off the grease soaked batter.  I will definitely go again but will order something else."}
{"text":"One of my faves! Their happy hour is always on-point, and their Shandies are so perfect in the summertime. We often go as a big group, sharing several of their appetizer options (veggies and hummus, chips and cheese, pretzel bites, etc.) and the pork belly nachos (LEGIT)! The place is huge and has very trendy/hipster vibe. They've generally got a lot of great beers on tap, so check out the draft list if you're into it. My only real complaint is how slow service can be sometimes. It's been pretty hit or miss for us, but if you can get someone that's on top of their game, it's a great experience!"}
{"text":"It's not typical of me to hit the bar with a friend to grab some beers but I was in AZ for a conference so I met up with an old Army buddy at this place. It was perfect! I mean beer is beer but the service at the bar was great! Valet parking was a bonus, and the pork belly nachos were killer! This place seems like it would be a ton of fun and I wish there was one closer to me in southern California. I guess there will be another trip in my near future! Keep it up, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My wife ordered the meatloaf and the kale/Sweet potato salad; A virtual Carnival in your mouth. The Kale salad contained perfectly mixed hints of sweetness with sprints of tart and bitter emanating from the kale and goat cheese.  While the dressing was light and slightly lemony.  As far as the meatloaf goes -way above the standard but not exceptional -exceptional, tangy, sufficient portioned, tomato and vinegar-based red sauce on top but the meat itself was just slightly above average for the caliber of the restaurant.  I ordered the Brussels sprouts.  I lived in Germany for two years, and have eaten brussels sprouts throughout Europe and America. Most restaurants have no idea how to make brussels sprouts the favorite spot on the dinner plate.  Let me just say this much, the culinary dropout is where you go to taste brussels sprouts if you want to like them. I also had the pork ribs which were also delectable."}
{"text":"A few nights ago, I came here with my boyfriend and three other people. One of the people in our party was a friend visiting from California for the week. So we had our own little version of a lazy \"Friendsgiving\" at the Culinary Dropout.

We had to wait just a bit before our table was ready. It was our first time there so when you get the menu, the top portion is starters with several different cheese and meat options. We each ordered a drink, which varies from beers to cocktails. (My personal favorite is the Moscow mule. I ordered the pomegranate one, but I wasn't a fan of it. Thankfully I liked another drink someone else from our table ordered and she winded up liking my drink so we just switched. No harm, no foul!)

It was fairly dark and pretty busy so when our platter of cheeses and meats came in, it was hard to see without shining our phone lights on it to determine what meat was what. The waiter also rushed through what order the meats were in and none of us remembered what meat was what. We figured it out as we ate. Everything was absolutely delicious and mouth watering. All the cheeses and meats were completely gone by the end of the night.

We also ordered some entrees, like the fried chicken, fish + chips, and the salmon toast. The two guys who ordered the fried chicken said it was mediocre. I personally didn't try the fried chicken, but the fish and chips were good!

Between everything, we split the check evenly which came out to around $40-ish per person. (There were 5 of us in total.) This place is definitely way more expensive for a dinner outing, but it's great for big groups. There's a Bob Marley wall, with a mural of his face along with his famous song titles surrounding his face. I was also told that they apparently have music nights on Fridays and Saturdays.

Overall, decent food and good customer service! The waiter was very sweet and attentive. I forgot to mention our group ordered the Brussels sprouts plus the mac and cheese, which unfortunately were all sold out but our waiter was very kind about informing us and letting us chose a substitute for the unavailable starters."}
{"text":"Best brunch in town. Came in this Sunday for brunch, place was pretty busy but service was on point. Had the French toast, chicken club, and the kale salad. Everything was amazing and tasty. What a great place to have brunch"}
{"text":"This place is super chill. Our waiter was really nice and recommended the pork belly nachos and a bunch of other things that we passed on. The nachos were good  tho. Apparently my sister liked them just cause the chips were different haha. But my drink was strong. The kale salad was really good. And the valet dudes were on their game cause they seriously ran to get our car. I shall be back!"}
{"text":"Great dinning experience at Culinary Dropout.  Looking forward to going back to try the other restaurants that are attached.  The Barrio (I think)  a seafood restaurant and the Yard with lots of outdoor activities to do."}
{"text":"This was a great addition to the Hard Rock Casino, which was lacking a good restaurant to relax and enjoy good food. The staff and service was attentive.  The food was even better.  We ordered the Fried Chicken, Fish and Chips,  Chicken Club and all dishes we shared were good, Not a bad bite of anything.  The Monkey Bread for dessert is a must!  For fun we ordered the Beer in the bag, which came with a surprise beer each time. If you like cheap beer like Pabst or Milwaukee Best, this choice is for you.

The overall ambiance is cool, dark stained wood with industrial look inside and modern and hip patio with a view of the pool.  Great for people watching and wondering eyes."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was awesome, great atmosphere but a bit too loud for my taste. 
Service was great even though it was packed."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this place after a bad experience in February.  In the interest of full disclosure, I was invited back by the manager for a free meal to make up for my prior bad experience so I will comment on that experience separate from the food.  

As far as making up ..they did that and more.  The service this time was excellent.  We were very well taken care of and I appreciate that my negative experience was important enough to them that they would bring me back to take another crack at it.  Great service ..the chef even personally delivered our meals (we all had salads).  

The food today was also excellent.  We had the gorgonzola chicken salad and the crispy shrimp caesar.  Both very flavorful.  We also tried the pretzel bread and fondue ...might be one of the best appetizers I've ever had.  The bread, by itself is great and ..of course ..most things taste better dipped in cheese.

So bravo to culinary dropout ...I am willing to go back there just for the pretzel bread ..but I am also anxious to see how the service is when my meal isn't being comped ..but they earned another shot ..so we'll see."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!  Matt the bartender is so friendly and attentive and very accommodating!!  Next time you come here make sure to sit at the bar with him!!"}
{"text":"Super trendy restaurant with pretty decent food. Service is kind of slow and the place is loud but it's in a great location and definitely a fun place to go whether it's your first or only stop of the night. 

If you like other Sam Fox restaurants like Sauce you will probably like this place. The pretzels which cheese fondue are so yummy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great! Very friendly servers and host. The ambiance and decor is light fun. They have yard games out back. 

A good selection of AZ beers, I just wish all were on tap but most were in cans. 
We ordered the pretzel bites as an app, this is a must! They are so good and provolone fondue is fantastic. Just make sure you mix it a bit so it completely liquifies. 
For lunch, I ordered the pub burger with bbq sauce bacon and fontina. It was a great burger! Exactly what I was looking for post marathon! I'm not sure I breathed while eating. I also chose the salad as my side, and I was actually impressed! Not being a fan of ranch, it was light enough to not be overwhelming. 
Many in my party chose the shaved prime rib w au jus. They raved and I mean raved. If this is down your alley -- go for it!!! 

We did have a gluten intolerant person in our party and they had a very hard time, if this is you. I hope you came for the drinks!"}
{"text":"Wow great atmosphere great food! Loved everything I have gotten fish and chips perfectly breaded. Pork nachos have great flavor and enough to share. If you love rainbow trout this is the place to get it! Various beers and my fav Deschutes Black Butte Porter!"}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner here a couple years ago, it was somewhat of a task to get a reservation for a party my size however, and if we wanted to reserved a table on the outside near the activities, it was something like a $1,000 minimum (I could be wrong, I just know it was something absurd). In any case, we ended up having a few more people, for which they gladly accommodated us, and still had a great time. Food is always good, and I'm a sucker for the pretzel bites w/cheese dip! Have been to both Scottsdale and Phoenix locations on many occasions, definitely a go-to spot when you want to get away from the generic bar/club scene."}
{"text":"Nice spot in the Hard Rock, good sized bar and outdoor area with corn hole to keep you entertained while you eat and drink. Staff was nice and attentive.  Small Pub style menu, but everything was fresh and tasty. We left satisfied."}
{"text":"I went to Culinary Dropout for a business lunch. Of course my business lunches aren't very \"corporate\". We usually talk business for about 30 min then its just regular chit chat. I enjoyed my experience here; I didn't give a 5th star just because of trying to find the place once you've parked in the garage (free parking). Other than that, the ambiance was right, chairs/benches are comfy, our server Matt was always on top making sure our glasses were full and we had everything we needed. 

We started off with the pretzel fondue; Yum! My main dish I chose the Grilled chicken club. It was better than you're traditionally made club. The bacon gave it this wonderful sweet taste I wasn't expecting.  The homemade fries were good, not at all greasy or oily.

I will definitely bring friends and family here again."}
{"text":"I'm glad I finally had the chance to try Culinary Dropout. Their Tempe location has been bookmarked for a while now but I have not been getting a chance to head their way. A couple of days ago, our team's Christmas dinner was held there. It was chosen because of the Yard that's kind of attached to it where people can hang out, play games and just have a good time. 

We got there at around 3:45pm on Tuesday. There is a complimentary valet service. When we arrived, I noticed that the place was slightly busy considering it's mid-week. I reviewed the main menu. They also have a happy hour menu which has a good selection of items for a good price. 

With all my food intolerances, I had limited choices on the menu to select from. This was pointed out to me by the waiter who senses that I was asking questions related to food allergy items so he made sure he clarified whether I had any allergies so they would assist me in picking the right thing for me or making adjustments to any menu items I may select. I started off with the bread with oil, balsamic and basil. I also ordered French fries. Other members of my team ordered Nachos and fondue with pretzels. Feedback on all those items was very good. 

A little later the waiter came back to take our orders for main dish, after going through the menu many times and crossing out things I couldn't eat, I was left with the salads particularly a chicken salad and the Shrimp Caesar salad. The waiter made sure he checked if the batter they dipped the shrimps in had eggs and suggested that he would replace them with sautéed shrimp if the batter had eggs. A few minutes later, the salad came out with the fried shrimp. The salad tasted great. There were so many shrimps, I was impressed. Never have I had a dish hay had so many shrimps outside my house! The portion looked small initially but by the end of it, it felt pretty generous, I was full. 

Overall, good service and food. Prices are reasonable too with some menu items being on the more expensive side. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the Hard Rock gambling and looking for somewhere to grab a bite.
I always dread the thought of food in casinos due to all the buffet type places I ate at while growing up.
Found the Culinary Dropout on Yelp with strong reviews.
 Yelp did not disappoint. My husband ordered the Pub Burger which he enjoyed fully.
I ordered the Italian Grinder . Italian sandwich on a lightly grilled roll. I can't say anything negative. Food was fresh and generous portions. Each plate came with a side of fries.
Cool environment and great service. When I'm back in Vegas will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a very good time.  If we had just gone for drinks, I think I easily would have given it 5 stars as everything was stellar.  Service, portions, bartenders - excellent.  
The food itself was very nice.  We ordered the pretzel balls and were not disappointed.  I ordered the chicken salad with the cherry vinaigrette despite the waitress's recommendation for the fried chicken, but I wasn't sorry for that in the least because after I finished polishing off my salad, I realized every one else was going the same.
Over all, I would take anyone interested in going to Scottsdale here since I had an excellent time even if it's popularity does make it a little hard to get into during peak hours."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and both times I thought the food was great! The space is large, with a bar, indoor floor, outside floor, and outdoor patio game area. There has been live music both times I went here - once was a solo musician on acoustic guitar doing covers and the other was a full out band that seemed to be playing their original work. I definitely love the variety in music! Food is really good too! Have tried the meatloaf and the trout, both were awesome! Lots of fun cocktail options too and tons of yummy appetizers! Will definitely be back for a third time!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is setup with 3 unique and very cool themes. The first part reminds me of a swanky apartment. There are plenty of tables and would be my pick if you were going out for dinner to enjoy the \"gastro\" part of this gastropub.
 
The second section is The Yard - a covered patio with plenty of patio couches, fire pits and backyard games. This is where I spent all my time so I'll tell you a bit more about it below!**

I believe the third part is called The Shed, or the Garage or something like that. It's a smaller, very rustic, barn-like building at the far end of The Yard and looks like it could be a whiskey bar or something to that extent. It was closed at the time so I didn't get a chance to check it out.

**I over heard a guy and a girl talking about how much they like corn hole.
I looked at them like a cow looks at an oncoming train. You could hear my eyelids blinking in confusion through the silence until another, more savvy Canadian at our table filled in the gaps for me...

\"It's that bean bag game, Dale.\" Suddenly it all makes sense!

The Yard is awesome. It's like a gentrified version of cousin Cletus' famous family BBQ - Fried chicken, pretzels, fire pits and games galore, including (you guessed it) Corn Hole! Maybe I'm taking this a little far. The Yard is by no means redneck. It's relaxed and quite lovely - you could hang out here after work, bring the the kids, go on a date, or yell belligerently about your college football team late at night. I have no doubt that this place must draw quite the party crowd on weekend nights, but you don't need to be that crowd in order to have a good time here.

The food is and upscale version of American comfort classics. Even though I was pretty fooded-out by the time I arrived, I still suckered myself into the fried chicken and I regret nothing. So dang delicious and served with a sweet sauce and a slice of corn bread."}
{"text":"Name well chosen !!!!!!!!!!!

Not to be sarcastic!!!!
The menu is worthy of any proper culinary drop put school.
I ordered french toast felt like card board, got another order but was as bad.
Black mussels dish was flavorless but we lucked out cause we had Tabasco to make it eatable.
Service was great though."}
{"text":"Went here after a stop at the Spa in Hard Rock- and maybe that's where I went wrong....set up and music are good but felt no connect - had the pretzel fondue and then the kale roasted beet salad with Salmon. The pretzel nobs were very good. Fondue was bland. The salad and dressing was very good but as soon as I smelled the salmon I knew something wasn't right. Not good. And then they were out of 2 drafts including Dales. Maybe It was was me...maybe I was there in the wrong night. Maybe."}
{"text":"Really good food and the setting was great place to hangout with friends. Good place to go on the weekend and enjoy some live music and have a good time."}
{"text":"Ok.. I have stayed at the hard rock a couple times but had kept missing their happy hour. So in December, we finally made our way in...and it was really great minus one hiccup.

I was coming off a diet with no bread so the decision was that any bread I had needed to be stellar!!! My gf I was visiting was very whatever about the famous pretzel fondue I told her about but once we got it, she was super happy lol! Who doesn't like cheese and bread? It. It for the vegan and gluten free for sure. We also ordered a round of cocktails and the pork belly nachos. Most of my friends are pork belly crazy but I am not, that said, these were great. 

Because they were slow and we wanted to visit, we did ask to sit at a table. I also have a leg injury I am rehabbing so long sits at a bar can be annoying. Some places can get a real attitude but they accommodated. Our server was great and that was before she gave us some extra cheese to take home with our extra pretzels we weren't able to finish. This was great because my gf's kids got to try it out and they were in love....super special and unexpected. 

The only blemish of the stay that keeps it from being 5 Star was an expediter/other server- the fit lumberjack type white guy with a beard, made a snide comment about the quantity of food we had when he dropped off a plate. 2 plus size women with two appetizers as our meal didn't appreciate it..."}
{"text":"Chilled vibe. Drinks were creative. Food was good. Had the Korean style brussel sprouts followed by the butternut squash cannelloni. Both great, but added the Korean sprouts to the sprouts in the cannelloni sauce and the dish elevated to the next level. Maybe the chefs should do this....It is a fun place. Great last stop on our tour of AZ."}
{"text":"Food's all good.  Hard to find a spot at the giant bar.  Charred Brussels sprouts were yummy."}
{"text":"After eating here for dinner three times, I've decided that I won't come back--at least not for dinner. I was impressed the first time by the trendy, swanky atmosphere and great selection of antipasti starters (you can create your own platter of meats, cheeses, and veggies). But the dinner menu isn't that great or plentiful. The list of salads and sandwiches outnumbers the list of entrees. Maybe I'll like it better if I try it for lunch next time."}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks, and service. Mike was the server, pretzel fondue for an app, fried chix and pork belly Cuban for the meal. Best fried chix I have ever had. Five plus stars. Only thing that would make it better is if it was locally owned."}
{"text":"I guess you can't please every pretentious a-hole with a handlebar mustache.  You can impress this guy though.  Pork Belly done correct."}
{"text":"The service started out great as they seated us before it was time to open! This never happens, great start to my day! Big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am usually a pretty forgiving person when it comes to restaurants. I really try to see the goods when there are bads and I will usually give a place a second chance since I understand that the wrong item is sometimes ordered. Yes, in a perfect world, every item on a restaurant menu should be amazing, but that simply is not the case. Anyways, I digress. This review is going to be pretty harsh because I honestly found nothing good about this place. Thank god I only came here because I had a gift card that needed to be used. I would have been pretty pissed if I actually had to pay for what we got.
When entering CD, I was somewhat impressed with the décor. However, even though the seats look big and cozy, I did not find them to be that way at all. Also, the hostess was not overly friendly. She wasn't mean or anything but not friendly either. The hubby and I decided to order the pretzels and fondue that everyone else raves about. It was ok. The pretzels were soft but most were not hot, and the fondue was simply ok in my opinion. For entrees, I decided on the sweet corn cannelloni while the hubby chose the fried chicken. I would also like to add that hubby was going to order the 36 hour ribs believing they would be fall off the bone, what with cooking for that long. The waitress was actually considerate and thoughtful enough to let him know that since they were not babybacks, these ribs were not going to be fall off the bone and most past customers actually felt they were a bit tough. After that information, he decided to retreat and order the chicken instead. 
The entrée portions were actually larger than we had expected. However, neither entrée was impressive. My \"cannelloni\" turned out to actually be ravioli. Also, I was surprised by the intense flavor of bacon on my dish, which don't get me wrong was ok since I eat meat. For someone who is vegetarian on the other hand, this really should have been mentioned on the menu. The flavor was ok, but really nothing impressive. The husband easily allowed me to try his chicken, which I knew was not a good sign. Usually when something is really good, he will be a pain in the ass about letting me try it and usually will tell me order my own. The chicken itself was cooked ok, but the batter had no flavor to it and the honey drizzle was only in certain places. The hubby was disappointed in the entire entrée stating that the biscuit didn't have enough honey and no butter provided, the mashed potato portion was puny and they were nothing impressive, and the 2 bites of coleslaw were bland. 
Because we had a 50.00 gift card, we needed to order something else so we decided on the apple money bread dessert. We were told that it would take an extra 12 minutes, which we were fine with because we thought it would be something amazing. Not even close. What came out was a small dish of \"monkey bread\" (which resembled bread pudding) and a small bowl of vanilla ice cream atop cut out pieces of menu which we presumed to be pre-used due to the large grease stain on the one underneath the bowl of ice cream. The monkey bread was very disappointing as it was mostly apples, and the cinnamon/ sugar mixture appeared to be sprinkled atop after the dish was done baking. Additionally, there was a spice used in it (I think it was ginger) that was wayyyyy too prominent. It left a disgusting aftertaste in my mouth. The ice cream was fine but we were pretty sure it was Dreyers. 
After finishing dessert, we waited and waited... and waited... only to wait some more. We had already let it slide that our waters were empty while eating dessert to which the waitress said she had several other tables seated so she was scrambling back and forth between them all. I found it interesting that she said this because the restaurant was practically empty. Anyways, as we sat waiting for the check, the hubby informed me that the delay was because she was sitting at a table with some obvious friends who had come in and basically just shooting the sh**. This really annoyed me. Normally, I am a patient person, but after having a crappy meal, I really just wanted to get home. I believe we waited for about 20 minutes just to get the check without her attempting to check on us during that time. 
So to conclude, Culinary dropout was highly disappointing. Food was not great, service was crappy... This is one of the few instances where nothing impressed me and I see absolutely no reason to return to Culinary Dropout. I gave it 1 extra star because the food was not horrible, portion sizes were decent, and the décor was aesthetically pleasing. One last thought though: Maybe the chef should go back to culinary school to learn how to season chicken properly and perhaps learn the difference in pasta's?"}
{"text":"Being a local I don't adventure out towards the strip at all but I'm very happy I did for this place and would make the effort again!  Came here for happy hour and sat inside due to the 104 degree weather outside. However they have a very cute and cool outdoor area with couches, bistro lightening and corn hole game.  Fall night time I can see myself coming to enjoy the outside part.  We only did happy hour food and really had no reason to go beyond since the pretzels and nachos we ordered were completely satisfying.  Most of our drinks were not on happy hour however we're very tasty and worth the typical $12-$15 vegas prices.  Our server was Sean and he was a delight.  We stayed for 5 hours and during this time had a chance to enjoy some live music... three ladies playing modern hits with their violins.  Pretty cool.  In any case just remember if there is a concert that night there is not happy hour.  Otherwise 110% recommend this place for happy hour!  Cheers."}
{"text":"The name is apropos!  I ordered a glass of what was supposed to be Argentinian Malbec at dinner, and is tasted like 2 buck chuck. I then ordered a steak with \"horseradish cream and herbed fries.\"  There wasn't a bit of horseradish within miles of that sauce and the fries had been sitting for a while.  I'd say my food was comparable to much less expensive, neighborhood chain. To top it off the service was slow. Our server asked how our food was and when we told him \"so-so\" he failed to check on us again. Skip this place!"}
{"text":"Good food. Loud echoing atmosphere. Services staff that was clearly hired only for their image.

Seriously bad font of house staff. 25 minutes to get my check after I asked for it. The bartender at the bar before being sat was rude. The staff didn't know the product very well. They were mistaken about several of the beers  (styles, taste, ect.) and couldn't answer simple questions about the food. The food was very good though. Credit to the back of house, they know what they are doing.

For such a polished looking operation at those prices I expect better from the front of house staff. At least they are pretty if nothing else."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch spot! We have three kids, and the relaxed atmosphere makes this the most comfortable brunch spot for us to meet up with friends. The food is great, and the service is even better! We love the central location, options for reservations and kid-friendly brunch environment on weekends. It's also great to meet up with friends for a kidless cocktail hour during the week!"}
{"text":"I only went here once because I had a $75 worth of Fox Restaurant gift cards and this is the only place in Tempe... I think. Anyways, I decided to take my parents here for a nice, relaxing Saturday lunch... Not what I experienced.

We arrived and the server sat us right in front of a \"band\" playing music. It was waaaay too loud. I requested to move across the room immediately which they accommodated. I think they were ticked off though because our server checked up on us like once the entire time we were there until the last 10 minutes when we paid. No water refills...

We ordered mussels, their oft-posted pretzel appetizer, butternut squash ravioli, and steak. The steak was overlooked for a medium steak without much flavor, the pretzel rolls were too salty, even after we brushes off all the salt on the outside of the roll. That compounded with no water refill and we were barely able to eat them. The mussels were also overlooked so they were really tough and the sausage that was supposed to be in the mussels were like specks, about the size of crumbs. Highly misleading. 

The one redeeming dish was the ravioli. It was slightly sweet with aromatic hints and well balanced. Nice dish.

The whole meal used up the $75 gift card but the one item I liked was the ravioli. My parents had one comment which I thought was funny. They said, \"We're glad it was free. The Red Lobster place was better.\" Hah! They know an overpriced, sadly lacking in taste meal as well as any foodie out there!

I only went there once. Maybe there normal cook was out sick. I don't know but I can't think of a reason to come back..."}

{"text":"Best restaurant in AZ! A must stop on our family trips. Lovely ambience, great drinks, and amazing food. Highly recommend the pretzel and cheese fondue, friend chicken entree, meatloaf entree, Moscow mules, and the cocktail called \"Room Service\"- all extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"A great place for vampires!  Huge chandeliers, dim lighting, wood floors, open late and one of the best gnocchi dishes I have had in a long time.  Great service, they split our order when we said we were sharing.  They also have an interesting order form for charcuterie which was really tasty and went well with their different wines by the glass.   Pretty and young people all hanging out late on a Friday night in a classy part of town."}
{"text":"After my last review, the manager contacted me and asked me to give culinary dropout another try. It was worth it. The pretzels were hot and delicious; and they made a special vegetarian sample platter that was pretty impressive. We couldn't even finish it. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food. Relaxed, chill atmosphere. I'd go again. Yum!"}
{"text":"Clubby atmosphere.  But great food and selection of beer. We had fish and chips, ribs, and tortellini.  Everything was tasty and filling.  The place is huge!  You HAVE to try the pretzels with fondue."}
{"text":"We came here on our date night...not exactly the best place for that occasion.

The girls up front were very nice and cheerful.   Our server was also helpful and patient in answering all of our questions about the menu and drinks.

It was so freakin' loud and dark in there.  The gothic decor was very interesting...I'm not sure what style they were trying to achieve.  While the booths were comfy, it had more of an office-leather-sectional appeal.  I hope I don't know the interior decorator personally or I'm in big trouble!

The menu was very similar to Arrogant Butcher but with \"hoochie mama\" atmosphere, hubby dubs (it was funny, I thought I'd share).  Since hubby wanted the pretzel bread and provolone cheese fondue ($10), I decided to go light with my dinner.  The half dozen oysters  with mignonette and cocktail sauce ($14) sounded so good right then with a side of cheap salad with ranch ($5).  I know I should follow the old adage of eating oysters in the months that ends in \"r\", whatevs.  The condiments for the oysters are very basic, nothing exciting.  The refreshing Acai Mojito hit the spot, tho--must try!

The yellow Chicken Curry ($14) was rich with coconut milk, but not too spicy.  My hubby enjoyed the overuse of lemongrass that paired well with the Sierra Nevada pale ale.  We were so full, we didn't have room for dessert...darn pretzels!

It was a good time and at least we can say we've finally been to CD."}
{"text":"Made an open table reservation for Saturday morning. (Don't need a reservation if you are there at opening). Outstanding service! We enjoyed mimosas, breakfast and cheese platter which was amazing! We had a fun time in \"The Yard\" with ping pong and corn hole. Live music was playing. Great mix of families, couples, and celebrations happening. You have to try this place! So fun."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here.  Service was excellent and extremely accommodating. Ambiance was great and we thought the decor was well done. We started with creating our own antipasto which was not only fun but done well.  I thought they could find a better dish to serve this on as a white china oval platter seemed bland. For lunch we also split the Mac Burger which put the golden arch version to shame. Chased it down with a tasty SAN Padre Blueberry Daiquiri!  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have absolutely loved everything I've had here! Great service and food keep us coming back!"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding and the food was amazing. This was my first visit to the Culinary Dropout and I had high expectations based on reviews from friends. I was not disappointed. Actually, I was impressed. I received a warm greeting from the host and our group was promptly seated. The atmosphere was energetic and although it was very busy we were able to enjoy pleasant conversations while partaking in the food and beverages."}
{"text":"I love culinary dropout its one of my favorite restaurants in tempe! Last time i went there i had the fried chicken and it was cold inside, i was so disappointed.."}
{"text":"I love this place! Wish we have more places like this in CA. Both the indoors & outdoors area are really cool. There's cornholes and lounges in the outdoors area. 

The drink prices are reasonable and the mixed cocktails are delicious. You can't taste the alcohol in the Deviant Behavior and it seriously tastes like a strawberry lemonade. The Gin & Tonic is also decently good here but I guess you can't really messed up on that. 

Really wished I was able to try the food here. Heard the fish & chips are to die for. I might have to come back to Arizona to just try the food here...maybe just maybe."}
{"text":"This place is always super packed. The yard is right next door and you have access to it from here. You can play games or sit and relax outside and enjoy the view. I come here for the fried chicken. It was awesome."}
{"text":"We have been here three times now and the service has always been well beyond average. We have always quickly been ushered to a table and the wait staff serves you with a smile on their face. I love the environment as well. 

My wife and I usually get the house made chips with onion dip appetizer and it is delicious. One time we got extra chips. I would recommend going during a happy hour, getting some drinks and this appetizer. I have also tried the meat loaf dish and it was very good, well cooked meat loaf and tasty mashed potatoes. This most recent time I got the fish and chips and it was incredible. The fish was perfectly crunchy balancing the delicious fish inside. The fries were also top notch. It was my wife's birthday and we were given a free dessert! What great service. 

As a musician, I am anxious to come back here to see the live music. I will probably do that sometime soon. Lastly, I want to share that we went to the location in Tempe on a night when they somehow lost power. We were greeted as we came in with not just an apology, but generous coupons for our next visit. Go here, both you and your taste buds will be treated well."}
{"text":"I requested to go to CD for my birthday.  I absolutely LOVE their pretzels and cheese.  They aren't anything super fancy, but it's one of my favs!  My turkey reuben had a somewhat soggy bun from the cole slaw but was still excellent.  I also got a free dessert for my bday- not something every restaurant does anymore.  The table shared a salted caramel custard which was garnished with caramel corn- AMAZING!  And i'm not much of a fan of salted caramel.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, this location is so LOUD!  It's really difficult to hear when you are inside, even when they don't have live music.  The tables are so big, it's hard to have conversation with anyone who isn't directly across from you.  Might need to rethink design...."}
{"text":"Such a fun spot!  Great food and the drinks were the best!  They have live music on Fridays and Saturdays which makes dining that much better!"}
{"text":"Delicious,  but pricey.  We were looking for another restaurant and came across this one.  I guess this would be a great place to hang out during the summer, for there is an adjoining pool area, but we came here during the winter months when the atmosphere of the restaurant was mild to nonexistent.    They have big tables for large groups which is great.  After all, it is Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ok, I really dislike signing up for things like Yelp.  Passwords, account set up, log in, etc.  BORING.  But this place was worth the effort.  I was super hungry for some good fried chicken, which is hard to get outside of my mom's kitchen.  I ventured in late (about 11:30) on Friday night.  I wasn't sure what to expect because end of the night dining usually gets end of the night service, food, etc.  I was pleasantly surprised.

     It started off with a stop by the hostess stand to ask if they were still serving.  She was nice.  Really nice.  That isn't always the case.  You know how some hostesses have that \"whatever\" attitude?  Like they are doing you a favor by talking to you?  Great first impression.  I've worked in hospitality and pay attention to things like that.  I told her that since I was eating alone I'd like a table where I could people watch.  She let me choose the table that I liked best.

     My server went through the menu with me but I was set for the chicken.  It came out pretty quick but that was ok because I was hungry.  The dish looked great.  It tasted even better.  The chicken had a slightly sweet, crispy, not soggy breading and was juicy inside.  Man it was good!  The biscuits were ridiculous.  Almost like little cakes.  Soft and moist inside.  I almost asked for more.  Mashed taters were rich (lots of calories I'm sure) and the gravy was the best I've had in a restaurant.  Tasted like the kind that comes from a cast iron skillet in your kitchen.  The surprise was the coleslaw.  I really liked it.  Usually restaurants mess it up.  Too much vinegar or too much mayonnaise.  This was good.  It's rare that I like all of what I'm served in a restaurant.  You know when what you are hungry for tastes just like you want it to?  Bingo, it all hit the spot.

     The manager was walking around checking on guests.  She recommended I try the monkey bread dessert.  So I did.  Think cinnabon meets your grandma's apple pie.  Comes with vanilla ice cream.  Soooooo good!!  The only problem is that I ate so much I had to take a nap in my car before I could drive home!  Lol.  JK.  The manager made a good call on that dessert though.  Perfect way to end my meal. 

To sum it up...it was a great experience.  Great food, good service and a cool vibe inside."}
{"text":"It's more hype than what it delivers... Parking is annoying, I haven't been back in over a year. Many better places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Food was a big let down and very disappointed. I got the prime French dip and the meat was very fatty and tuff to top it the waitress spilt the aju and made the bread soggy my wife got the beer batterd fish and it was very oily we could not tell our server because she never came back to check on us so needless to say we went with out drinks being refilled as well by our server but asked another person who he was great about it and he would let our server know to come over.. It took another 15 minutes and she came by and said do you need anything else or any boxes since most of our food was not eaten. Told her know and why. She then said the kitchen must of spilt the aju because I'm always careful and that the fish is a big seller.. Do you need anything else I said yes my check and the manager. She said okay but we're really busy. Walking away waited BTW we told her leave our plates to show manager. But no such luck no one came left my cash and no tip with a note on receipt to be called by manager.. Never got a call. I really didn't think I would but wanted someone to know the issues."}
{"text":"Great afterwork hangout-good food and drinks!
I recommend the pretzel roll fondue for a group.  It is typical mini pretzel rolls with a cheesy dip.  The portion is so large (good thing) that we took the extra home with dreams of using them for home made sliders.
We also ordered the deviled eggs which have a delicious earthy flavor that I believe comes from truffle oil.  Just order them!
Our last app was the beet dish.  Not a fan and I love beets.  They just were not anything special and were drenched in a balsamic dressing that was lack luster at best.
Dessert rocked.  We had the carmel corn and the salted carmel custard. Yum.
The room is large, noisy and conducive to having a good time.  Ask for the corner table for the best people watching,  Oh and order a mule to get things started!"}
{"text":"Great place for a fun dinner! Cozy but hip lighting and cool chairs and decor help set the vibe. There's live music most nights of the weekend too!

We split the Shrimp Caesar as an app and they didn't skimp on the shrimp. I had the mussels app as my entree and it was a huge portion!  Prices aren't horrendous, and service was great. 

Would definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I've gone a few times since and have had much better experiences. The food was good, the atmosphere was fun."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot for casual dining. It has a decent drink selection, good bartenders, but not so much of a food menu. It is sometimes very loud, but a nice environment if you are feeling social, but do not want to be in a shoulder-to-shoulder crowded place."}
{"text":"I am so picky.  This place is fantastic.   First off our server was on top of her game.  She lived the menu and enjoys her work.  Made it fun to be there.  We loved the variety.  The pimiento cheese spread was amazing.  My favorite thing was the s'mores dessert.  We are usually not that big on Dessert, but that dish was mind blowing my good.  A must try for anyone who appreciates amazing desserts."}
{"text":"Love this place... Great drinks great food and even better service a must to check out while in vegas"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, but our server was inattentive. The ambiance wasn't all that great...tables too close together, so the server's ass is in your face."}
{"text":"We ended up here for a business dinner, in one of the private rooms. This place was JUMPING. A very young crowd, I'm sure due to its proximity to the ASU campus. We were served house made chips and pretzel bites as appetizers, and both were excellent.  For our entrées we had the option of meatloaf, fried chicken and some type of fish. I had the fried chicken, it was 3 bone in pieces, white and dark meat. It came with a biscuit, mashed potatoes and coleslaw. It was decent. My husband had the meatloaf with green beans and mashed potatoes. The meatloaf was average, he's not into ketchup smeared on top, and then they put the green beans in the ketchup in top of the meatloaf.  For dessert they brought banana cream pie, and a s'mores pot de creme type thing. The s'mores was pretty tasty!  I'd have loved to have had a real meal here, but I'd bookmarked it before our trip and was glad to get to try it!"}
{"text":"I only gave them 3 stars because the atmosphere is nice. I went with a big group so lots of different food was ordered, none of it was good. Fried chicken was supposed to be one of the top rated dishes, I was not impressed. Biscuits and gravy, salty. Broccoli n cheese soup, tasted like week old soup- to cheesy and lumpy. The waitress was great and the Shandies are awesome.  Make sure you try a Shandie."}
{"text":"Of course I always have a Shandie because they are the greatest (dark beer mixed with a hard liquor and fruit) a must if you go there. I was not impressed with the food last time so I tried a deviled egg. They have a $3  bite menu that just right when your drinking. It wasn't the greatest but it did the trick. I'm anxious to try a different bite next time I go."}
{"text":"A bit pricey at times, but the drink specials are great and the food is quality. Also great environment for fun with friends."}
{"text":"I really like this place, although it is a bit pricey and the menu doesn't have a ton of options - they're still good ones. I love their sweet potato kale salad, but it is a bummer that it's seasonal so you can't get it year round there. The music on the patio is a little loud during the lunch hour during the week, but the service is always great."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, friendly service, and great food! Very accommodating. We enjoyed the pretzel bites, trout, filet, and salmon.. All delicious! The dessert (monkey bread) was also amazing. Recommended!"}
{"text":"WOW!  just went  first time  and loved it.
Pretzels n cheese appetizer was a much larger  portion than I expected absolutely delicious. Homemade potato chips and french onion dip was great also then entree fried chicken was great scanning  other tables everything I saw looked great 
Will return for certain"}
{"text":"First time ever coming here let alone the hard rock. Came for a bite to eat before a concert and we got Ian as our server. I gotta say I work in the food and beverage industry and he delivered exceptional service! Definitely will recommend this place and come back. The food and service was awesome."}
{"text":"I came here twice during my vacation...2 Times! The name is really catchy and saw the reviews and decided to give it a try. The location is very edgy and very big. Love that it never really gets too busy to sit you down right away. Anyways we started with appetizers and everything was so fresh! The Brussels sprouts were delicious, the pretzel buns and cheese dip was so good we took some back to the hotel! The waitress was very down to earth and helpful. Sorry I forgot your name! ? but she was great and attentive. I ordered a blueberry beer and I highly recommend trying it!
Overall my lunch, brunch or whatever was amazing. The place is super chill and the ambiance lived up to its hippy/ edgy name. I will be back to try some other foods... oh the fried chicken was soooooo tender and juicy.  lol I hope you give them a chance."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails and delicious appetizers and great music.  Can't beat that!  We did make a reservation which was needed.  Seated inside which was perfect for people-watching and to listen to live music.  We both had mixed drinks and loved them.  We did a cheese/salami/ham platter and several other appetizers.  Definitely order the cracklings with cheddar - they are delicious.  We also split the kale salad - tangy tahini dressing and the kale was nicely dressed.  Great night"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to meet up with a large group or bring out-of-towners! This location is attached to the Yard where customers can play corn hole or ping pong to pass the time. The food is absolutely phenomenal and there is a full bar inside or outside. The pretzels and cheese fondue is a must anytime you visit and is super cheap on happy hour too! All the entrees are delicious, but even my grandma can't stop raving about the battered fish she got. For dessert, I'd go with the monkey bread which is enough to share with the table. The had to deduct a star because the wait is soooo long a majprity of the time, they don't accept reservations, and it's mandatory valet :("}
{"text":"Great location great atmosphere!!! I love this place, super  energy and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Yum!  Oh my God - if I lived here I would be a groupie!

Very cool vibe here and really good food!

They offer an antipasti menu that works very similar to a sushi menu. You select items and they bring them out on a platter (or in our case two).  We had an assortment of cheeses (highlights were the manchego cheese and the olives) roasted peppers and tomatoes, and it came with bread.  

For dinner I had the butternut squash cannelloni with mushrooms and brussels sprouts.  The only thing I could to improve this was to put actual brussels sprouts, not just some leaves, into this dish - otherwise it was perfection on a plate.  If I could I would have picked up and licked my plate clean - the sauce it's in was so good.  

Almost forgot - I ordered a strawberry with basil martini which was also very good. Apparently the bartenders are award winning mixologists.  

The downside for us was our server was really bad. He was nice and friendly, but I don't think he knew what he was doing and seemed to disappear for long periods.  At one point he came back to our table to explain that he brought the wrong drink for someone at our table. Who by the way was drinking it without complaining.  The waiter sat down the correct drink and then nervously apologized, and said \"I'm sorry, but I have to take this\" and took the half consumed \"wrong\" drink.  

But, the food was so good that I just don't care - and am eagerly awaiting my next trip to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I had decided to go here with a friend in the spur of moment, not really knowing what the place or pricing. 

To start off, the service was great. It would seem that they knew right away that we were knew to the place and the owner came out to introduce herself and the point of the restaurant. 

We decided to get happy hour appetizers because we didn't realize how expensive this place can get and we had already eaten before we came to this restaurant. I got the nachos and my friend got the cheese fondue with pretzel and greatly under estimated the amount that would come out. 
The nachos were really good, the pork brisket was tender and full of flavor and the cheese wasn't overpowering and gag-worthy. I'm not a fan of cheese but the nachos were really and I would definitely come back just for the nachos. 

The only reason why I am giving this 4 stars, is because the cheese fondue was pretty plain for the price it was selling for. The pretzel was good for being made from scratch but I wasn't impressed as I was with my nachos. But I could be biased because I'm not a fan of pretzel and cheese anyway.. 

Overall we paid about 13-14 dollars for both plates and there was so much leftovers to bring home 
 
I would most definitely come back here to try their drinks and other food. Everything sounded so good. If it wasn't the fact that I am a lightweight and it was during the daytime I most likely would have tried their drinks no doubt."}
{"text":"Everything had craft as a big part of it which, when it comes down to it, is what makes a meal worth eating outside of the home. It is worth your money. 

The pierogies are everything everyone says they are-- just order them!  The monkey bread is perfectly moist and not too big-- perfect for 2 or 1 if your meal isn't too large. 

We want to come back for happy hour sometime because we have heard really good things! 

The General mood of this place is EXTREMELY cool. Like, so cool we felt both underdressed and overdressed at the same time. Just be prepared to feel inadequate. 

I didn't actually like the Korean cap that much ? just not my fav flavors and it was pretty price. That's the only thing we wouldn't ever order again."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout.. what do I do with you?  I love coming here for some day drinking.  The ambiance day and night says you need to come eat, drink, and be merry with me, but the food doesn't fully live up.

I followed another yelpers suggestion on the olive oil and crusty bread which was great.  I got some olives to go with it.  The shaved prime rib dip was okay.  The french onion soup was just a bit too viscous.  The gnocchi my gf got was really dry, but I remember another time it being awesome.

The different cocktails are fanciful and tasty.  I'm usually a scotch on the rocks person, but their acai mojito and bloody marys are great wake me ups.

Ambiance + Drinks are great.  Food is meh.  Figure out what you want to do, but I say stop by for a drink and some apps.. then maybe make your way down to herb box or fnb."}
{"text":"You simply cannot go wrong in any of their restaurants. It's a bit pricy, but man is the food good. The service is also quite good. By all means order the pretzel and cheese dip - the round pretzel balls are fabulous as is the cheese dip! And, there are lots of them! We go back and back and back!"}
{"text":"poor service, cold food, witnessed the wait staff being extremely rude to a family that brought their teenagers for lunch and play the ping pong, foosball, etc. 

 I get that they are focusing on adults, but at 1 pm when the place is empty they should get over it...

wont return. ever."}
{"text":"Check out their happy hour. Monday through Friday, from 3-6, it includes $3-6 snacks, as well as $3 PBR mugs, $4 well cocktails, and $6 mystery shot and beer.  I stuck with the wells, but they were well made and you can get them with their house-made lemonade.

We sampled the meatloaf sandwich and cheese sliders (both $6) and the house-made chips and onion dip ($3).  The portions are great (regular sized meatloaf and three mini grilled cheese sandwiches); these were delicious. The grilled cheese were perfectly golden and melted and the meatloaf was tender with a great sauce. I loved the homemade onion dip---yum!  The pretzel bites looked good and came in a generous quantity, and the antipasto platter also looked good, but alas, we were too full from our hearty snacks.

Great open floor plan lets you see the kitchen, the bar, and out to the patio/pool (it was closed on the December evening when we were there). Service was great, and although it was a Friday evening at 5 pm, with a Bowl Game in town, we were able to be seated immediately.  I wish that I would have gone on earlier in the week (so I could go back several times during my trips."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! It definitely fits in well at the Hard Rock. We've been here a few times, and each time was great! 

We tried the Korean spiced Brussel sprouts, oysters (so fresh) their signature soft pretzels and nachos! The pretzel portion is HUGE! Enough for at least 4 people. 

The service is great too!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Scottsdale, this was one of my favorite places to bring out-of-towners. For those of you who are familiar with FRC's this one will not disappoint. For those of you who don't know what FRC's are look it up, and then come here. 

The only way to start is with the Pretzels with Provolone Fondue. If you come a second time or have several people the house potato chips are very good as well, but don't fill up on appetizers. Also, if they have a good \"Yesterday's Soup\" namely the tortilla, I highly recommend. 

I've had just about every entree and a couple of the salads, or at least tried. The Bistro Steak is a pretty good steak, but if you are looking for a good steak, head over to Modern Steak across the street instead. The two best entrees in my opinion are the 36-hour pork ribs, and the Fried Chicken. 

The ribs are so tender they literally fall off the bone if you try to pick them up so don't worry about them being messy, best if you use a fork. The fried chicken is somewhat of a mystery to me. I'm not sure how they do it, and I can't even put my finger on what exactly is different about this fried chicken than other contenders, but this is by far the best I've ever had. 

If you don't mind low-end beers, they have the \"Paperbag Special\" for less than $2, which is a bunch of assorted shitty beers. I always liked it to save money and create mystery. 

They have a book of cocktails with really cool names. I've never been one to order cocktails at restaurants because I ALWAYS feel like they are a waste of money, but if you're into that kinda stuff they have some seemingly pretty solid ones here."}
{"text":"We came to Culinary Dropout after reading Yelp reviews, and if I'm being honest, also because I like the name. It was my first time at the Hard Rock Casino and Hotel. We parked in the garage and that entrance wasn't a far walk to the restaurant. We decided to dine on the patio and enjoy the nice weather. Maybe we should have chosen an inside table because the music was blaring out of the speakers. Seriously, the music was disturbingly loud, and I wasn't able to properly enjoy the meal or atmosphere. Also, we were there during Happy Hour but specials weren't offered that day because there was a concert in the city later that night. Keep that in mind if you're going specifically for HH. On to the food. We ordered several appetizers. 
Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue- good; but a huge, very filling portion. 
Cheddar & Pork Cracklings- very good; light and airy, great flavor, my favorite out of them all 
Strawberries, Brie, & Pistachio- ok; prefer them served colder
Sherry Glazed Beets & Goat Cheese- ok; if you like beets, then try them with goat cheese
Crusty Bread, Garlic Oil & Balsamic- ok; basic bread, flavors didn't stand out
Oysters (1/2 dozen)- good; if you like them, you know what to expect
The Soiled Dove (cocktail)- very good; I like the individual can of Jose Cuervo they gave me
Overall, an okay experience here.  A few adjustments are needed, but I would give it another try."}
{"text":"One of the more edgy/younger/hipper of the FRC's. Hence the name. 

I've been here a lot and here's what I like to do:

Start off ordering the Pretzels with Cheese Fondue and/or the House Potato Chips with onion dip. Neither of those will disappoint and go great with beer/cocktails. 

Don't waste your money on the specialty drinks that outline the menu. They're all pretty expensive for what you get and I've never been truly impressed. They taste more like the bartender was a dropout. Go with beer or mixed drinks that you know. Feeling risky? Order the Brown Bag Special. You'll get a can of Natural Light, Busch Lite or PBR. A nifty novelty. On Sundays, get the bacon infused Bloody Mary. The bacon slice was bigger than the one on my burger. No joke.

I like to order the Pub Burger. It's got havarti, bacon and nice bun. Not as overwhelming as the MAC Burger. If you've had FRC burgers, these don't stray from that recipe. The Fried Chicken is greasy and incredible. Ask for extra wetnaps. I'm also a big big fan of the Turkey Pastrami sandwich. The tender meat meshes well with the bread and cheese. I'm not usually a pickle person, but for some reason the side dill pickle complements the overall flavor perfectly. Honestly, I've been satisfied with almost everything here - except the curry.

Don't go on Fri/Sat nights unless you want to wait an hour. There isn't a dress code for the waitresses/hosts so it's got a cool hipster vibe. The patio is a good place to sit on an amiable night.

Bottom line: Order your favorite drink, one or two of the appetizers, and split an entree."}
{"text":"CD was actually a large amount better than I expected it to be.   Driving past it, I thought it was a cooking school for hipsters but once I found out it was actually a restaurant I was intrigued. 

I had a taste of the soft pretzel & provolone fondue which was awesome, and then for my entree I had the Short Rib Pasta which I wished would never end.   Seriously, I ate slowly so it felt like it lasted longer.  

The only star I'm subtracting is for the over-the-top douchy ambiance, it's definitely tailored for a \"certain crowd\", which is a shame because the food was so good.   I would feel awkward bringing my parents to this restaurant.

Its almost like they are trying too hard to try too hard.  

Seacrest out."}
{"text":"Unbelievably wonderful food. Great decor and atmosphere. Comfortable patio as well. My only gripe is that sometimes I'll get a host/hostess with a total snob complex and/or a server who seems like they don't have a brain cell working.  When I drop good money to dine out, I expect courteous, accurate, and efficient service. It's just as important as the food. If they can weed out those people from their staff, I'll give them a 5 star with no problem."}
{"text":"Probably everyone's favorite place around here! Such a fun place to take friends or family when they are in town! Their pretzels are totally the star of the show. They also have amazing drinks if that's what you're in to! Their food is good, nothing crazy. However I think their awesome environment makes up for it! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and area but the place is very echoey.  The restaurant is large and very accommodating and we will be back.  The biggest draw back was how it amplified the noise, much different then the Scottsdale location. Wait staff was amazing!"}
{"text":"Solid food.  Good service.  Great outdoor ambience.  Off Mill and good crowd to just chill.  Hard to beat this place when the weather is fabulous."}
{"text":"Love the set up of this place. Huge patio and two restaurant options. Great drinks and food is good. The pretzels and jar of crab are a must"}
{"text":"Food is very good! Atmosphere is trendy and the patio is casual!
Really liked this place"}
{"text":"This is a great spot in downtown Scottsdale.  I am visiting from NY and found this place to be trendy with a great atmosphere and even better food. Everything my group of 4 ordered was amazing. Definitely order the frIed chicken or ribs as an entree. The pretzel fondue was fantastic as well.  If you are visiting Phoenix you need to check this place out."}
{"text":"It's been a hit and miss here. Had some great service, and some that made me never want to come back (being overcharged on my birthday dinner, for example, because of the waiters mistake). Their bread and cheese fondue is a must. Great atmosphere! Best service I have ever had here was tonight with Brittany, and we were a larger party. Props to her for handling all of our needs and making it a great evening!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and play games. Played corn hole and ate lunch. Love the appetizers  of antipasti and variety of other foods."}
{"text":"I drove by this restaurant last week and remember thinking \"wow, that font style is very Fox Concept-y!\" Lo-and-behold, I wasn't wrong! 

My friend and I had dinner here on Saturday night for her going-away farewell. We were told by the hostess that the wait would be 5-10 minutes. I ordered a Home-EC martini while we waited, and it was okay. I love basil, but I'm not sure if I could get used to it in my drinks. The size of the drink for the price was a bit disappointing as well. 

For an appetizer, we ordered the soft pretzel and it was amazing!! The provolone fondue with the soft, warm pretzels were so delicious! My friend and I were really surprised, and impressed. The chicken tortilla soup was also really good. There were small chunks of tomatoes in the soup that had just enough spiciness. After two impressive starters, I was excited for my coq au vin, but I was actually really disappointed. The sauce was way too sweet for my liking. The vegetables and chicken were cooked well, but it was pretty difficult to put down the sauce. 

Although we waited much longer than 5-1o minutes for our table, the service here was pretty good."}
{"text":"Not a ton of vegetarian options, but super fun and cool atmosphere. great place to hang out w games for customers. a little pricey but worth it for fresh food and festive atmosphere"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout has a lot of ups and little downs.  That atmosphere is awesome.  It's really laid back, sometimes it can get a little to loud if you want to have a conversation.  The Pretzels and Cheese Fondue are unbelievable!!!!  I usually make it my meal.  I was disappointed in the Cesar Salad, but the Meatloaf was awesome.  The drinks are ok, and somewhat overpriced in my opinion.  I've always had great service and the staff is really friendly.  Overall I really like Culinary Dropout, but I would recommend this place if you are looking for a quiet place to have a conversation.  This is a place to have some drinks, be loud and be excited for the weekend!!!"}
{"text":"Don't read any reviews other than mine of course. Just go here, order a drink, then have the meatloaf, and you will be the happiest person on earth. Peace out. WE will be back, lots. Oh and the pretzels with the cheese dip? They will change your life."}
{"text":"I was greeted immediately when I walked in.  Only had time for a drink and a quick bite.  There were plenty of choices for both.  However this place makes the best old fashioned  in the valley anywhere.  
Service was superior and they actually take the time to meet, greet and get to know you.  
Decided on Pierogis and enjoyed every bite.  Took another order home for later.  

Weather is getting perfect for outside dining and there is plenty of room there.

Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Came in for a fairly large company function and had a great time out in the Yard.   Played bags and Ping Pong.   Came back to eat at the restaurant and was very pleased with both the food and the service.   Pretzels and fondue were amazing.   Enjoyed the best Old fashion I've found in the valley.   Great live music ( not so loud so we could still enjoy each other ). Easy Valet Parking.  We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, fantastic service and yummy food.  The restaurant is dark and enchanting with sparkly chandeliers.  nice place to go for date night.  We sat next to the stage where they have a live band playing on the weekends.  Had the pretzel & fondue~yummy, chicken salad and fiance had the burger with havarti cheese & bacon.  the burgers and sandwiches come with fries and they are thin, crispy and addicting!!!  I'm not a burger lover (aside from an in an out plain burger) and i loved his burger.  delish!  will come again for sure and i'll order the havarti and bacon burger."}
{"text":"Say what you want about form preceding function in the west-coast restaurant scene (and you'd be right), but Fox RC knows what they're doing. All of their restaurants are well-designed, well-staffed and well-fooded. [The notable exception being Olive & Ivy, which I feel is like the gorgeous girl at the party who talks a lot, but really shouldn't].

Culinary Dropout is one of Fox's best and, so far, most unique productions. It's a beautiful contradiction. Trashy class, unrefined elegance. And it's confident, in both its design and cuisine. The Fish and Chips (with a PBR of course) were the best I've had in my entire life, and not by a little.

But CD is not for every person, nor for every occasion. Establishments with this much arrogance forfeit the luxury of being able to rub everyone the right way. Generally, I don't see it as a \"girls night out\" destination or a place you'd go for Mom's birthday. Then again, I'm sure there are some classy women out there who'd appreciate the paper-bagged Pabst as much as I do.  CD is something to be experienced, at least once, even if you decide afterward that it's not your cup of tea. Stop by for dinner or drinks, appreciate the place for what it is,  and know that the menu means \"crusty bread\" in the best way possible.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Solid IPA selection, positive service, good food.  Get the pretzels and cheese/meat plates!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch with my husband after reading the rave reviews. Have to say I was a bit disappointed. Had the pretzel with provolone fondue---pretzel bites were warm and tasty and so was the fondue, but it tasted more like cheese whiz than a restaurant fondue and definitely did not taste like provolone. Ut was creamy and warm--I can see this as satisfying drunks, not real lovers of fondue. Had the Cubano sandwich, another disappointment. The roll was too soft and couldn't hold up to the thick piece of pork--which had a lot if fat pieces. And who puts lettuce on a Cubano? It made it slimy and half way thru I switched to eating with a fork. Fries were good. The decor was ok---a bit dark for my taste, that always makes me think they're hiding the dirt in the floor. We had a nice server though."}
{"text":"Moved from Austin Texas to PHX. All I have to say is  ATX Texas would be a better town if they had this place to eat at.
Food was incredible, and the atmosphere was awesome.
Will be back and you have a walking billboard for free with me. I will send anyone I know here because I have no doubt they will Love it.
Thank you"}
{"text":"Great place.  Lots of new, American Cuisine items to choose from.  Very trendy and hip.  I have taken many clients here, and they always seem to enjoy it.  I recommend the Pretzels and the Italian Grinder!!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out for the first time tonight. First off, it was packed. There were LARGE parties everywhere, including bachelorette groups galore. I had mojitos and the pretzel app while waiting for our table at the bar. The mojito was standard and fine but not worth the price tag. The pretzels were good but the cheese fondu it came with tasted really strange to me. I was not near as impressed as the other Yelp reviewers with this particular dish. 

Dinner was a bit better. We waited about 45 minutes for a table but once we ordered our food it came out in less than 10 minutes. I tried the fried chicken, which was generous in size and cooked perfectly. However, the mashed potatoes were standard and the biscuits were dry and flavorless.

I will say the staff was very nice and extremely helpful. Also, the cover band that was playing when I left was pretty damn good. I also thought the decor was interesting and well done.

Overall, I would say the food is ok but I feel it's more about the Scottsdale scene than anything else. If that is your thing, you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Love the yard! It has ping pong, corn hole and many more things to do in the huge patio. The signature drinks are great. The only downfall is how busy it is some times and the wait time for a table"}
{"text":"Great environment! Good for groups too! We had the pretzels and cheese fondue. So so good. Entrees...Italian Chopped salad. Oh dear lord...amazing. Super fresh and more than enough per serving. Husband had the prime rib sandwich. (Can't recall the actual name). Super tender meat with cheese on a nice lovely roll. Very tasty.

They even have games like ping pong on the large eating area/patio section. So much fun! We'll be back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Really good and clever menu and the food is terrific. Service was spot on and the drinks were good. Pretzel w/cheese dip and chips and dip were devoured!
Three entrees: rainbow trout. Pan seared and delicious with sautéed green beans and tossed almonds. Fried chicken had a little honey in the batter which made it very rich. Piping hot- cooked perfectly. Biscuit, Cole slaw and mashed sides were excellent. Fish n Chips were hot flaky and delicious. 

I think this is my favorite Sam Fox Restaurant Concepts restaurant.

Oh- a little loud hence the 4 stars. But that's the way people like it now so, take that for what it's worth."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout features deliciously creative dishes, in a relaxing but tasteful environment. Price points are higher as it is Scottsdale, but not outrageous enough to make you gasp.

I stumbled across Culinary Dropout while exploring Fashion Square, and what a pleasant surprise it was.

To drink, I went with the Soiled Dove. A mix of blackberry, and Paloma, it was very refreshing and super easy to drink.

For food, I started with the Perogies. Served in an order of 3 for $10, at first glance, I was a bit disappointed due to the cost for the portion size. As soon as I took my first bite however, this opinion quickly changed. The perogies were incredible, and some of the best I've ever had. The mustard creme fraiche they were served on top of only further helped add to the dish, and really made it stand out.

For my entree, I had the Turkey Pastrami Sandwich. While I love the Turkey Pastrami itself, and the pretzel roll it was served on was quite delectable, I didn't particularly care for the slaw on top, as at times, it sort of took over the dish, making it hard to taste the rest. It was served with a side of handcuffs fries, but not a personal fan of the fry style, I only picked at them, rather than eating them all. 

Service was fantastic throughout the entire meal, from the very friendly hostess who greeted when I came in, to my server, Kelsey, who was always around whenever I needed anything.

I will definitely be returning to Culinary Dropout again in the future, and look forward to returning on a night they have live music!"}
{"text":"Had a decent meal here...it was close to our time share! Our server was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu! Had a Kale Chicken Caesar Salad. Was good the kale was tender so it was treated well!! My husband's burger was HUGE and looked  delish!"}
{"text":"It just goes to show that you don't need a formal culinary education to cook beautifully. Culinary Dropout hits all the right notes with its delicious food. Take great ingredients, interesting compositions, and beautiful presentation and you have CDO. 

The place can be quite boisterous as it gets later on in the day. Sit at the bar if you're dining alone and have a few beers or some wine. There's local Arizona beer as well as canned beers in paper bags. 

Don't miss the charcuterie. It's only $5 for a healthy one-ounce serving of any of these meats. It's sliced paper thin, almost transparent, leaving the flavor no space to hide. Prosciutto is classic. A supplement of $8 is what it'll cost you for the Jamon Iberico, a truly special kind of meat that comes from special, acorn-fed Spanish black Iberian hogs that will leave you hungry for more. Rarely do I see it offered at restaurants but when I do, I always order it. You should too, as their slicing technique is perfect and the meat is perfectly salty and flavorful.

I also ordered the special (very limited) Korean style ribeye-cap. Ribeye cap is the fattier end piece of ribeye that is normally discarded after grilling or broiling a whole ribeye steak, but the kitchen does wonders with it, recognizing with a keen eye that we should not treat it as a second-class cut of meat. Instead, they marinate it in soy, ginger, garlic, spicy Korean paste (gochujang), and other aromatics, grill it until nicely charred on the outside and medium rare on the inside, and serve it dressed with sliced zucchini, bean sprouts, beech mushrooms, onions, cilantro, raw garlic, and more of the soy dressing. The raw garlic is amazing, providing a zip and delivering a respectful nod towards authentic Korean BBQ.

\"Yesterday's soup\" also caught my eye -- the name on the menu is meant to do that. The name will definitely solicit questions; maybe they should change it. But I enjoyed a bowl of chicken noodle, rich with flavor, as if my grandmother had been simmering a pot of chicken bones for hours. My only complaint is that the white meat in the soup was dry and flavorless. In the future, maybe the kitchen will learn that tender chicken meat in soup is welcome (either dark meat or white meat that's just perfectly cooked).

In any case, the service is wonderful, the space is lively and noisy, and the food is amazing. I'm looking forward to visiting again and seeing what a culinary dropout can do."}
{"text":"Not as good as its Tempe counterpart, but equally as creative. The menu omits a few things that the Tempe CDO establishment proudly showcases. However, it has the mainstays from the menu, such as steak with gorgonzola sauce, fried chicken, and 36 hour ribs. 

The space is airy, spacious, and perfect for relaxing with a beer or glass or wine while watching Sunday football. Come here with some buddies and split a charcuterie plate. During brunch, it's not on the normal menu though (strange)."}
{"text":"Easy safe bet. Decent menu, good bar, good overall, this only real downer is the insane amount of people stacking up in there on weekend rush hour..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here twice and really liked everything about it, so I decided I wanted to have my birthday here. I called a week and half in advance and they told me they couldn't reserve the spot that I wanted for my party but I could come at 5 and wait around until 7 so I could save the spot. I declined. I had my boyfriend call back the next day to see if we could reserve a table or tables in the patio area for 12 people. They said yes they could do that. Today the manager called my boyfriend back and told him that they couldn't reserve a table for a large party after 6pm (party at 7). They told him if we wanted a table at 7 we would have to come as 'walk-ins' and take a table that was available (if there was any available for that many people)

Overall I felt very discouraged and unwelcome. What Resturant doesn't take reservations for large parties? Wouldn't a Resturant want to have large guaranteed party to come in to spend money at their place?

I highly doubt I will go back anytime soon which sucks because that place is pretty cool but their policies and staff are not!"}
{"text":"Every time I tell someone I ate at Culinary Dropout, they give me the same blank stare. If you could see the puzzled look on their face, you'd know they are trying to resolve this oxymoron.

Last week, I met a business colleague for lunch at the Tempe location. My previous visits here were around happy hour and dinner. Lunch time is busier than I expected, so I'm glad we arrived early. It was a gorgeous day sandwiched between the recent rain storms, so we were happy to sit on the patio.

Speaking of sandwiches, I selected an excellent salad! I'm a big fan of seared Ahi Tuna. Who knew how good it could be on a simple chopped salad? And it's even better when paired with cashews, avocado, and sesame seeds with an Asian dressing. The portion of the salad and the Tuna were both very generous. This was a New Year's resolution kind of meal, but I'd be happy to enjoy a salad like this all year long.

The vibe at mid-day is unusual. Having seen this restaurant/bar/lounge/game room in full swing in the evening, lunch feels like the calm before the storm. To be more specific, this storm has a unique atmosphere, excellent service, a laid back attitude, great food and drinks, and lots of fun activities on the patio.

Culinary Dropout is a just a hop, skip and an illegal U-turn off of Mill Ave. Stop standing there with that look on your face and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good beer selection. Staff is somewhat impersonal and treats you like a dollar sign. But that is on par with the behavior of the staff in Old Town and the rest of Mill."}
{"text":"Great place for large groups! The place is spacious and clean with multiple options to entertain yourself and have fun. The food is good, although in my personal experience it has been very \"hit and miss\". Although to be fair, I tend to be a little picky about my food."}
{"text":"Place is big and open, a lot of room for big parties. Tried the pub burger and was not disappointed. Their salad was also really good. Very friendly staff. Complimentary parking too."}
{"text":"Come for the food stay for the atmosphere. I got the 36hour ribs for my Birthday they were amazing. Will be going back to try the rest of the menu. Staff was super friendly, Rob our server, did a great job with our order and help us our with our appetizer issue. Awesome experience can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Pretzels and cheese... omg!  The pierogis are the best! Drinks are delicious. Can't say enough good things about this place! Oh turkey pastrami... daaaaamn good"}
{"text":"Decent food, however over priced for what you got.  I had the sliced prime rib sandwich $17. Way too pricey and I have had better a half the price else where.  I would recommend not having a live band on a Sunday lunch afternoon in the dining room.  Not only were they bad, it was way too loud.  Couldnt hear yourself speak.   If you have to have the live band at that time of the day, maybe on the outside patio would be better.  I did like the layout of the bar, will probably come back to sit at the bar for cocktails and appetizers."}
{"text":"Got in late one night so I gave this place a try. Cool place with dining outside right next to one of the pools. I had the chicken club with fries. Nothing special. The fries were great. The bacon was outstanding. ( yes, I love bacon that much, and yes outstanding was the word). Beer was cold, the fireball was not?? She did offer to chill it though. I'll be back. There was a ton of stuff on the menu I want to try."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to take clients! Food of the charts and friendly servers. Really enjoyed our lunch can't wait to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"So, I've been to a couple events where culinary had a booth and I really liked their pretzels and provolone fondue. So I bookmarked and made my way over. Me and some friend decided to go for dinner and grab some drinks and food. We of coursed started with the pretzels and fondue and some drinks. We each ordered our own drinks and passed around. We order the Moscato, Room Service, and After School Special to start. I was the lucky one to order the Room Service. It has gin, strawberry simple, lemon, and sparkling wine in it and I usually have other liquors, but it was served up and it was delicious. We then ordered our food. I ordered the fried chicken, which came with a biscuit, mashed potatoes, and slaw. It came with 3 pieces which was more than enough but it just wasn't very seasoned. It was just okay. Allyface ordered steak which I thought was a little cold and Niy Niy ordered the shrimp and pork belly ramen. I think his was the best bowl at the table. We also ordered another round of drinks. Next order was another after school special, between you and me, and pinot grigio. I wasn't too thrilled with the between you and me. The belvedere and grapefruit just didn't do it for me. As far as service they were great. We came in and were brought out water before we even started ordering. Our waiter was helpful with the selections as far as drinks and choosing between some menu items. I just wasn't impressed. I mean it was good but it wasn't worth the $150. I still want to go back and try the captain crunch french toast, that may win me over... we shall see."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, really nice atmosphere with cool live music! Pretzels with fondue and pork nachos were amazing, left feeling stuffed."}
{"text":"Fun place!!!! Great ambiance... Great people.... great food... Fabulous drinks..."}
{"text":"This location is very hip with a funky vibe.  A little too funky for my taste.  I felt very out of place, not dressed like a hipster.  The food was pretty good though, servings a little small but tasty.  That being said the pretzels and fondue weren't out of this world even though the server told us they were the most popular item.  I will say service was spot on so mega points for that!  I don't think we'd return to the Tempe location, but we might check out the one in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow, we got absolutely terrible service. The only reason that this place is getting more than one star is that the good was great. 

When we first sat down, I asked about the happy hour specials and was told what they were but that we couldn't get them and would have to pay full price because we were seated inside. I told the hostess three times that I wanted outside as he was bringing us in, but I didn't want to make a fuss about it. We asked to be moved and the girl said that would not be possible, but what we could do is go to the bar. My friend and I went up to the bar to get our happy hour specials while our third friend who doesn't drink waited at the table. While we were getting out drinks three different people came up to my friend who was still at the table asking what the problem was and where we were and what we were doing. They were so rude to her she wanted to leave.

Pro-tip: if you offer different prices at different spots in your restaurant people will go for the cheapest.

The rest of the time the waitress was very rude to us and even ignored me several times when I asked for our check. I don't want to come back here if I can help it."}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant my husband and I really liked the decor especially the leather couches we had the strawberry and Brie the fried chicken and ribs really good food I will be going back to try something else"}
{"text":"Horrible meal.  I rarely post bad reviews but this place is an exception. Lots of flair and show. Not good food. Just wanted a huge steak and got such a small portion I couldn't even find the steak in between the vegetables and way over spiced.  My husband just wanted some easy fish and chips and it was so overcooked it was hard and chewy. We didn't even finish our meals and went to find pizza.  The manager offered to comp the meal but not to remake anything.  We paid our bill regardless as we aren't out looking for freebies. Save your money and skip this place.  It seems the dropout in the name is real. They need to go back to chef school."}
{"text":"A very cool and hip place to hang out with awesome food. Get the big pretzel fondue. It's big enough to share and very tasty. We also had the burger and meatloaf. Both were excellent and the portions are more than generous. 

This place is huge, spacious and has cool bar and game areas, lots of outdoor seating.  There are also plenty of tvs to watch for sports fans."}
{"text":"It makes me so happy that Phoenix has so many great food choices.  My husband, daughter and I landed at Culinary Dropout for dinner Friday night.  I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the Chili Thai Chicken Wing appetizer as my entree.  It was quite delicious with a nice balance of heat and sweet.  I was missing just a bit of garlic but that's it.  The slaw that accompanied the wings was also tasty.  My husband ordered the Bistro steak with potatoes and said it was outstanding.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly.  My daughter gave two thumbs up to the Fish & Chips.  Our dinner was topped off with Monkey Bread and Caramel Popcorn (two separate dishes).  Excellent all around.  Oh, and the live music was excellent too.  I would recommend and return to Culinary Dropout."}
{"text":"For Happy Hour & appetizers I give it 4 stars. But our meals were not worthy of more than 3.  

I had a very bland prime rib dip with an overly sweet french onion au jus.
Burger and ribs....average.  Now the fried chicken looked good and the pretzel balls with cheese fondue were fun.

Specialty drinks with school themed names like \"Dirty School Girl\"....very fun!  Mind you their all about $10 each, yes just for 1 drink.  That's Scottsdale for you.  High rent has to be paid!"}
{"text":"The facility is very nice with an large open patio. Family friendly with cornhole games and a casual environment. The food was decent, expected more from the brunch menu. The service did not live up to it. Staff dressed in casual jeans, whatever shirt they wanted and converse in all colors. I'm not necessarily opposed to it, but it made it impossible to determine who was staff. Waiter sat at our table to ask about drinks, food, etc. - awkward. The meeting spaces looked nice. The weather was nice enough to sit outside with space heaters and misters that spray everywhere. That seemed like a design flaw. Huge wrap around couches which were actually plastic."}
{"text":"Really good food and environment. If not sure what to get, get the nachos or the meatloaf!"}
{"text":"Really great place to grab a drink and eat tasty bites! The entrees are good and antipasto is awesome! Raw oyster choices are nice too. A good place to eat when you are visiting the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino."}
{"text":"This is probably the best review I've left on yelp! I was absolutely in love with this place. We stayed at a nearby resort for our (kidless) anniversary weekend and took a lyft to the yard/culinary drop out. We were lucky to team up with a couple playing cornhole while we waited for our table. Two games later (losers!!!) We were seated. 
Jeffrey, who was so awesome, was our server. He had recommendations, knowledge and a great personality. We had Thai wings for app (yummy!!) Some of the cheese/meat/veg/bread suggestions (garlic something or other goat cheese!!!) and split an entree, it was the ribeye (some special cut I don't remember) with delicious veggies and a few cocktails. We actually had dessert also. It was a caramel vanilla custard which sounds a little ordinary but was absolutely amazing. 
What a perfect evening. It was our 13th anniversary celebration and couldn't have been better. I want to come back for my birthday! Great food, awesome wait and extraordinary service. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Granted, I have only visited this locale once, but it was enough that I felt compelled to offer my opinion. 

I went with my new boss as a lunch outing to talk and get to know each other. The ambience was super cool. Wonderfully comfortable seating and they had a whole area dedicated to games like ping pong and bean bag toss. I want to go back just to enjoy some of that! They get kudos for the whole setup.

I decided to get the (what I considered expensive) roast beef au jus. Let me say, I do not know WTF they were thinking. First off, not enough meat, then they decided to butter the bread inside (wait for it...) and then put mayo along with onions and the beef. YACK, it was so greasy. I compare eating that to eating the nasty mayo-ey ultimate cheeseburger from Jack in the box. You end up not wanting to eat everything because the greasy mayo-ey mess is nauseating. To top it off, not enough fries either and to be honest I wish they offered a healthier side option because that was too much fattiness. 

I will go back and give them another try, but that sandwich alone put me off. I think I want to just go drink and play ping pong...sorry CD."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout. Three stars, I'm sorry. It's nothing personal. It's just the vegetarian / broke college kid in me doesn't find your menu very accessible. What can I order beyond the pretzel and cheese dip that is going to be worth the pretty penny? I was super excited about this place because of all the rave reviews I had heard from friends and colleagues, but ultimately it wasn't the place for me. Interiors are beautiful and service is not bad, the menu could use more variety for sure but may be I will come back for brunch to give this place another fair try."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come when I'm in town. Matt and Lauren are amazing bartenders! Thanks for putting up with Travis and I."}
{"text":"I am in town visiting family for the holidays and the last Tuesday night of 2016 my brother & I chose Culinary Dropout as a prime spot for our double date. We were lucky enough to have Jade as our waitress. To put it simply she was amazing from start to finish. Jade has a very natural pleasantness to her and a sincere aura that made us demand she remain our waitress even after we moved tables out of her section. Culinary Dropout is a great place in itself and Jade is going to be the reason I remember it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the entire experience! Had an amazing server in Felicia (spelling wrong) and also had Great interaction with Alyssa! Food was very creative & great flavors. I have Celiacs and have to eat gluten free, & server was aware if any modifications I needed to make. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The appetizer menu is to die for with the pretzels being the best in my opinion. I'm not a big drinker but do enjoy a good cocktail every now and then. The Moscow mule is very good and the Bloody Mary with bacon is perfect. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it can be hard to get a seat especially on the patio but that's a good problem for them to have!  Busy place!  Take that as advice to get there early."}
{"text":"Honestly, I loved this place for so many reasons. 
1. Everyone was extremely helpful and looked like models. So it was hard not to stare at them. 
2. Very hipster feel to the restaurant and they have live music. At night it's beautifully lit outside and not at all hot, even during the hottest time of the year. This restaurant is huge! 
3. Customer service was on par! Especially for someone like me who is on crutches :(. They helped me out by opening doors and clearing a walk for me. AND did I mention how gorgeous every work is? Lol. For such a big restaurant they were well staffed. Our waitress did an excellent job. 
4. as for food, I had the Mac burger. It was amazing!!! It's like a McDonald's Big Mac but taste a million times better! I loved it. 
5. This restaurant is unique. If you are a tourist, this is a must go to place. 

All in all, this restaurant had everything, a great crowd, a great decor and atmosphere, amazing customer service, and the food was exceptional. 
Oh AND it's right downtown Tempe but has free parking for their guest!!"}
{"text":"Great potential.....okay service but what really was annoying is the hype of the happy hour.  This is only available if at the bar or at a table.  So 12 of us there....no where to sit and they wouldn't give us happy hour pricing.  Happy hour  is everywhere to me...so none of my friends or I will be back.  Feel this is a bit of bait and switch.  Food and beer good.  Need better management."}
{"text":"Ambiance and decor is awesome. They have a live band Thurs- Sunday in the evenings. The appetizers were my favorite part- Get the pretzel bites and cheese dip! My entree salad was small, but good."}
{"text":"They have a good looking and friedly staff. I tried the jambalaya and chopped salad both were well executed. I could have went for a more spicy jambalaya but  it was spot on. Good job!"}
{"text":"Our first time in Tempe and Yelp reviews brought us here.  It is an lively, energetic vibe much like the town.  Food is 4 star but corn holes, pool tables, giant bar and wide open space filled with happy people make it a 5 star.  Ribs were delicious, and cocktails were nice heavy pours.  Our waiter, River, was friendly and gave great service and advice about food and ASU.  Will will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good.  Beer was good.   Our bartender treated us well.  We really enjoyed our dinner.   Food was okay but not over the top.   Really depends on what you order.   Service was great though and I would go back."}
{"text":"Sadly, not the usual level of service I'm used to bringing clients here during the week. Came in around 5:30pm. There were plenty of open tables. But instead the hostess said it would be a half hour wait to get a table and instead offered my teenage daughter and I a table in the bar area. Let me tell you, the conversation around our high top table was not appropriate nor the amorous behavior of a couple directly across from us at the bar. Just for fun we kept an eye on four two-top tables during our entire dinner. Not a single person was seated at them during our stay. A bit frustrating to say the least as we sat on a backless bar stool. In addition, it was a bit surprising the number of flies we had to shoo away during our meal. Will be finding another place in Tempe that is more accommodating for meetings and events in the future instead of ever subjecting a client or friend to this kind of disappointing level of hostess service."}
{"text":"prime rib dip....i had better 
the bread are very thick 
onion soup/ad jus needs more broth 
nothing special 
the way i see it ...its' just another Fox restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible service coupled with cold food. Stay away from this place. It seems like it's ran by unprofessional young staff that need more training in customer service so they know not to conversate with fellow employees when they should be attending to guests. It feels they just don't care about your experience.  Yeah, the managers are nice and fix the cold food thing but when it's happens 4 times on different visits somethings wrong."}
{"text":"Not to thrilled..... Everything was super salty.  The fancy drinks were very gastropubish and they did have a paper bag wrapped beer for $2.95 (didn't try it though) the apricot heff was yummy. It tasted like a light blue moon. My amazing girlfriend who wrote this well thought out review enjoyed the ambience of the outdoors but wishes that there was either fans or misters. 

Chicken meat balls, way to salty..... Pretzel fondue, ask for for no salt, it was so salty it was unpalatable! 

Devon was an excellent server, he obviously didn't cook the food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the industrial look. Our server was great very attentive, she proactively apologize for our food taking long and we did t even realize it was! I got one of their specialty vodka cocktails which was delicious. For an appetizer we had the pretzels and cheese fondue. Soo good and large order, these pretzels were the size of biscuits! I was disappointed with my meal, I ordered the kale salad and it was way over dressed which made it very soggy. I would definitely come back and order the dressing on the side with any salad."}
{"text":"Always super delicious! The pretzel bites are a MUST HAVE!!! Food is a little on the expensive side, but understandably so with the ambiance and food delivered by the kitchen. Great spot for group/company outings."}
{"text":"Been twice. The first time, it was a 3 star visit. Thanks to my second visit I was impressed and added a star. The food is decent. I wish there was a few more options for breakfast. I came for the Miss Margaret drink since it's fantastic. Server neevr asked how my meal was until we received the check. That's what really lost a star in addition to having the wrong food delivered to out table instead of to the table next to is. I recommend siting at the bar for a bit! The bartenders are fantastic and make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cool, and our waiter was nice and friendly. But the food was subpar and very expensive for what it is. Overall, this is a restaurant and they are in food industry not the atmosphere industry.  You will enjoy this place if you are okay with spending $5 on a bite of cheese."}
{"text":"I say 4 out of 5 stars. Here's why. It's actually partly my fault for not looking more into it, but it's hecka noisy in here. I came here for my birthday on Friday night and none of us could really hear each other. The music was great though. Which added on to not being able to hear each other. The second reason why I am giving 4 out of 5 is it's really expensive and they don't have a lot of choices. Again my fault. I forgot to do my friends are vegetarians.  I'm an awful friend. So if you're vegetarian, there isn't a lot of choices. I spent $22. I could have easily spent more money. That was on 2 appetizers and my meal. I almost got a drink and/or dessert. But decided against it. The drinks were pretty expensive too. I got the smoked salmon avocado toast. Holy crap it was amazing. Everyone loved their meal. Which is why I still say 4 out of 5. The place is really big and really cute. The service was great too. Just the level of noise became sorta bothersome. The price I was okay with since it was my birthday but I have my friends to think about too. I also got two snacks as appetizers. I got the balsamic asparagus and the deviled eggs. Both were very tasty. I'm glad I came here and got to try. I recommend trying but just forewarning it's a bit more expensive and a bit louder. Expect to just listen to music or have to talk over the noise. I'm still impressed with this place otherwise."}
{"text":"Perhaps Culinary Dropout should have stayed in school... Great vibe and atmosphere, if this wasn't a restaurant I'd rate it 5/5. However this is and the food is bland, cheaply made, and expensive for the quality.

The gentleman that waited on us, said he was new and didn't know much about the menu or beer list. Perhaps he could have guided us to better choices. Overall the atmosphere and energy was great. Just disappointed in the food. It showed little effort to plate or/and prepare. The salmon was in odd chunks over the three pieces of avocado toast. The nachos were completely dry under the minimal amount of toppings. The fondue tasted like queso to me out of a can."}
{"text":"Management was unwilling to work with us while planning a birthday dinner. They said they do not take reservations and we could call ahead when we were on our way. We called ahead and the guy who answered the phone said that they are really busy and can't fit us in. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"So not worth the hype, went there with a friend Saturday around 630, was quoted 45mins, which was expected for Saturday night. Ended up waiting an hour and 30mins, given a free appetizer, that was cool and we were super excited to try the food. We were told that everything is made in horse fresh. Had the fried chicken which was not good, no seasoning. Sub the coleslaw for Mac and cheese and tasted like it came from a box, mashed potatoes tasted instant. The biscuit was pretty good. My friend hated her meal the same as mine, sent it back after 2 bites. At the end the waitress packed our food and she didn't end pack all my food, I had one bite of my biscuit and half a piece of chicken on my plate and i ended up paying $25 just for myself. So annoyed will not go back. Please don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but the food was overall delicious! The Buffalo Chicken Meatballs were fantastic. Great craft beer selection. Ambiance and Decor was Hip. Definitely recommend the Pretzel Balls with Cheese Fondue."}
{"text":"This place is pretty gooooood.  I think the meatloaf is still my favorite by far, but the best part is imbibing on too many cocktails."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hoopla is all about? 
Great location, very busy and loud. Plenty of eye candy also.
I ordered the Bistro Steak. Well, the garlic fries were good at least. I expected a much better steak, but that didn't happen. Friend of mine also ordered the steak and also mentioned when the fries taste better then the steak, the meal must have missed its mark. 
We had a company dinner there, had about ten people. Made reservation about a couple of days before. They had the table ready to go about 30 minutes before our reservation. Service was great, the staff were very friendly. There was one of our co-workers very satisfied with the ribs. He gave me a sample and it tasted great. 
So there you have! Order the ribs, not the steak."}
{"text":"Went here on July 3rd for drinks and played shuffle board. It was really fun. It was 110 outside, but inside the patio area it wasn't too bad. The drinks were yummy too.."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite restaurants, this is where casual dining meets amazing chefs. I love to sit at the bar and watch the chefs prepare the antipasti... those guys are amazing at what the do!

I highly recommend the Capicola, Sopressata Toscana and the bresaola salumi meats, paired with the Humboldt Fog... I ordered... and re-ordered this 3 times during  my dinner!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 5pm on a Saturday evening. We sat next to the window to get a view of the patio/pool area. It is mid August and they had the door open to the pool area, OPEN! It was so hot and uncomfortable in the restaurant. The open door invited unwelcome guests to our dining experience like flies on the window and 2 birds that hung out around our table. 
We ordered grilled asparagus- $4 for 5 wilted spears- that comes out to $1.25 a SPEAR.
I ordered King Crab legs for dinner. They came on a plate of ice. They were only slightly cracked. I asked for crab leg crackers. The waitress said that they didn't have any. How was I supposed to eat my crab legs? She took them back and had them split again. Needless to say I ended up with crab meat in my hair, on my lap, and on the floor. 
My bf had a burger that he compared to the average burger joint.
The resurrection of the meal was the monkey bread. It was hot, moist, and delicious."}
{"text":"Oh Man!  I love this place!  Came to eat here before the Linkin Park show back in January!  The drinks were pretty tasty and gave me a pretty good buzz!  The food was great - pretzel bits and the Salted Caramel Custard were my faves!  Service was spot-on, even the chef came to deliver our food and chat a bit!

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food was good as always, but this is by far the most disorganized location! I had reservations and ended up waiting AN HOUR for a table. Don't bother making reservations, they literally meant nothing. Most of the staff was polite about the situation except for one blonde girl at the hostess stand who was very rude and acted like it was my fault that they didn't have my table. Excuse me for thinking that reservations mean that you shouldn't have to wait an hour. She continually told me we were next to be seated which wasn't true. I had a party of 6, which is why we made reservations days in advance. They sat multiple other parties of 4 in front of us at tables that we saw parties of six get up from. The hostess then told me I was wrong about that. She then told me that had to seat parties in the order they arrived (what are reservations then?) and basically began ignoring me. I really tried to be polite, but when she basically accused me of lying about the parties of 6 I saw leave, I was mad. Like I said great food, but if you have plans avoid this place because they do not honor reservations."}
{"text":"We begrudgingly came here after Rehab once we found out Johnny Smalls was no more.  We weren't prepared to like the food or the decor or the staff.  In fact nothing in our minds could compare to the endless small plates we could have ordered at Johnny Smalls.  But we were mistaken!  The food was delicious, the staff was extremely helpful and hospitable, everything was reasonably priced, and the decor was reminiscent of dining in the park.  There were some tables with a firepit, couches, household mirrors on the walls.  Very hipster, very fun, great food.  Love."}
{"text":"I was visiting Arizona for the first time and exploring and enjoying the sights and flavors. My friend suggested we try here. This place offers causal cool dining with lovely decor and the most unbelievably comfortable dining chairs on earth. The food did not disappoint. The burger and fries I had were made to perfection. I tried a drink called the After School Special - if you enjoy tequila and beer, plus some added tastes to sooth your pallet, then this is your drink of choice. Meet a friend, enjoy the music and savor the expertly prepared food and drink selections. Definitely a place I plan to visit when I return."}
{"text":"Very dope spot. 

Great Salads, sandwiches and charcuterie. 

The Ice tea is amazing. 

Get the chicken Gorgonzola salad and the deviled eggs."}
{"text":"Love this place for HH. Plus, the space is adequate for larger groups and work parties. Culinary Dropout is definitely a go-to for me.

Order the pretzels and cheese, but be warned, THEY ARE DANGEROUS. I will eat a whole basket if my pals don't keep an eye on me.

Service can be kind of slow, but I've always had a good time."}
{"text":"I decided to give Culinary Dropout another chance and damn, I'm happy I did. I decided to go solo as I just wanted to eat not participate in a social gathering. I started out with the pretzel rolls and cheese fondue and those were perfect as they always are. I really love those things because there are always plenty to take with and enjoy at home the next day. As my second appetiser, I ordered a variety of things off of the checklist that is left on the table. It's a paper that reminds me of ordering sushi as far as checking off what you want and how many. Anyway, I ordered quite a few things and this is what they were (I did take a picture as well). Olives, brussel sprouts, capicolla (2 types) grilled asparagus, cheese that was so soft I could spread it with a fork on the bread, and the toasted bread slices that had their own variety of items on them as well. This I cannot forget. There was what I believe to be white raisins in a sweet \"sauce\" that was UNBELIEVABLE!!  It was just a tiny portion supposed to be more of a flavor accent and it was so good I could've eaten a small bowl of it. Just absolutely delicious!!! For the main item I had the Korean style ribeye cap. I ordered it medium rare and it was actually cooked exactly as requested. I don't know why but most restaurants can't seem to get medium rare cooked as requested but this was melt in your mouth, perfect! It was sweet with just a tiny tiny bit of spice to it. The combination was actually perfect as I don't like too much spice especially on beef. It came on an iron skillet with bean sprouts and zucchini and was thickly sliced. This ribeye was about perfect! For dessert I had the monkey bread. This was baked to order so there was a bit of a wait but the wait was worth every second. I'm sure most of you are familiar with this dessert but this was different in a good way. The reason I say that is because it's baked in its own tray and actually has chunks of fresh apple baked with it that are still crisp, crunchy, and sweet. The vanilla ice cream that comes with it in its own cup is delicious as well and is perfect to cool down each bite you take because as I said, this dessert comes fresh from the oven. I finished this off as well and enjoyed every single bite. I forgot to mention that my beverage of choice in addition to water was a new beer featured from Rogue Brewery called something 8. I'm sorry but the name escapes me right now. This beer had an 8.8% alcohol content and was smooth as butter. I say that because there are beers or ales out there with a similar alcohol  content but are harsh and actually unenjoyable to drink. This was the total opposite and was very very easy to drink. Great choice, Culinary Dropout!! I took some pictures this time of most of the items I mentioned and as you can tell, this dinner was a much better experience than the last time. My last trip just happened to be one of those nights where things just didn't click. This night they did and everything meaning the service, food, wait times, and just how everything worked out I guess you could say was spot on. I really had no complaints. I just went in with an open mind and let things work out as they would work out and I was happy. This is definitely a \"different\" restaurant in a good way and I think when you go in just have that open mind and you'll be happy as well. My servers name was Lisa and she did an excellent job as well. She was informative, attentive, and very nice. She had a great personality and sense of humor and was a pleasure to work with. Culinary Dropout, you have renewed my opinion about your establishment and again, I'm very happy I gave you another shot. My dinner and experience was awesome and I for sure recommend you to anyone out there!"}
{"text":"This is a must visit! The environment and the home made pretzels are the best. Travel quite a bit and like to try different restaurants and this place was a recommendation that was awesome!"}
{"text":"I went here two times and tried at least 6 different foods and all of them were terrible. They even messed up a pretzel and cheese.. didn't think it was that hard. Harkens has better food.. it's trying too hard to change one little ingredient to call their own. The fried chicken wasn't very tasteful and it had 2 stars on the menu (compared to the rest of the menu with no stars). Also, the nachos tasted odd.. which was probably the cheese they use."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is a fantastic restaurant located in the Hard Rock, Las Vegas. The menu is fresh and the food is delicious. 

We ordered pork belly toast with chips and dip to start. The pork belly toast is so juicy and flavorful. The combination of pickled items with cilantro, the chili oil, Sriracha aioli, and the tender pork belly on a crispy toast that soaks up all the juice goodness is to die for. I would eat two of these as a meal. I was pretty bummed to share such goodness with my husband. Fortunately, the chips and dip were enough for 3. We took the pork belly toast plate and poured the leftover sauce on the plate all over the chips.  It was fantastic. The French onion dip cooled my tongue down from the slight spice on the pork belly appetizer. The chips were super thin and very crispy. They're perfect. 

When our food arrived, I ordered some fries since my Korean cap comes solo. It was a lot of meat and tons of vegetables. The Korean flavor was great with some serious spice. I couldn't stop eating. My husband's chicken was hard not to eat, so I grabbed the drumstick and dove in. I love how crunchy and hot the chicken is, and the coating has a ton of flavor. Their chicken is super tender and juicy, and between the homemade biscuit with a but of mash, gravy, and coleslaw-say goodnight! 

The fries were beautiful. They come hot, fluffy, and with the perfect amount of salt. I almost ate the basket solo but I shared at one point. 

Good food makes people happy, and this restaurant left me smiling. I'm I'm a fan and will be back for more."}
{"text":"This place is fun, it's like a big warehouse with indoor games. The food is goooood...The pretzel fondue is my favorite appetizer (but all the appetizers I've tried were yummy-house made chips and dip, pierogies) and my usual choice is the turkey pastrami...lots of good choices, service is usually good. I dig it."}
{"text":"So good! Great food, fun ambience (if a bit raucous), live music, creative cocktails. One of my fav's. Usually full on weekends so get there early."}
{"text":"Alyssa reached out almost immediately after I posted this. She was determined to make it right and wanted us to have a good date night again. Alyssa asked if we'd be willing to come back another night and that she would pay for the meal. We came back and it was great as always! We really enjoy coming here and enjoy the fun atmosphere. Alyssa, thanks for making our experience great as always! We'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"We visit often. The food is consistent and the patio is a lot of fun. Beware...sometimes they close for a private event, so call ahead if you're using Uber!"}
{"text":"Eh.

First, the dress code is really off-putting. If I had children, I would never bring them here. I felt very uncomfortable with half naked women walking around in what I thought was a \"nice\" restaurant.. it just seemed very unprofessional. 

We had a coupon for free pretzel fondue, which we've had before and loved! I can't believe it's 10 dollars though. Really?! It can't possibly cost more than $2 to make. 

I ordered the pub burger and was completely unimpressed. I asked for well done and the meat was pink inside and oozing liquid which made me bun soggy (gross). Also, there was barely any BBQ sauce... I couldn't even taste it. The pickle was delicious.. and the fries were below average. 

My husband got the grilled chicken club and didn't care for it. 

Ultimately, there was nothing on the menu that we were excited about... Nothing sounded good. (besides the over priced pretzel fondue).

I doubt we will go back, there are so many other choices out there. 

OH AND THE MUSIC IS TOO LOUD!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. The pork belly nachos were enough for 4 but skimpy on the meat. The perogies were a great twist on the classic. Great craft cocktails. Very loud inside. Possible wait before 7 . Packed with local college kids. This would be a great spot in California."}
{"text":"I think this is really 3 1/2 stars so know that going in.  Also know that I'm going to be really, really picky right now because I think they can handle it.

Mother-daughter lunch New Year's day. Walked in to a not-too-full, not-too-empty restaurant at 1:30.  Hostess was charming....and our waitress was as well. Very, very good service.

Ordered the chips and dip (again) - they were perfect.  I see I wrote last time they were a little greasy....this time we couldn't stop commenting about how NOT greasy they were. Perfectly browned, crispy and delicious. Plus we swore the basket kept refilling itself. No matter how much we ate it never seemed like it was disappearing.  Weird.

Daughter had the grilled cheese sliders (with bacon and tomato) and liked it a lot.  I had the seared tuna salad....and here's where I'm going to get picky.  The whole thing was waaaaayyy too cold. Especially the lettuce.  I felt like the flavors had absolutely no chance to work together to create a deeper flavor.  Towards the end, as it almost came to room temperature, I started to actually be able to taste the flavors of the tuna, the light dressing, the avocado, the cashews and the wasabi balls (or whatever those are called). Please....don't serve this salad that cold.....it truly does make it fairly flavorless. Also - the wasabi thing-a-ma-jiggys really didn't add anything - the cashews gave me a crunch - put a little wasabi in the dressing if you want that flavor in there.

I'd still come back - I like the atmosphere, the service, and definitely the menu choices."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. 

The decor is modern and eclectic. They sometimes have live music on weekends which is great. 

The service is always good and fast.

The food is great!  We were told to order the pretzel dippers and loved them. Ate them all which filled me up so I couldn't finish my salad. But our meals were amazing as well. Large portions. Drinks were great too! 

When people ask me what my favorite restaurant is, this is always a top three for me. Love it here."}
{"text":"Creative, fun, and on top of their game. They have the food down, the service down and the locale....just go!"}
{"text":"Found this place based on other yelp reviews. I mean, how else do you find restaurants in a new area? We were here at lunchtime and this place was hopping. No wait though and we were seated quickly. Hubby and I shared some pretzel bites for an appetizer. Absolutely delicious and the cheese fondue dip was excellent. We shared a chicken pesto club with fries and it was delicious.
Super cool atmosphere and we definitely want to return on an evening when there is live music on the patio."}
{"text":"what an interesting place. there ain't NOTHIN like this in cincinnati. 

for real, a very cool concept. i wasn't sure what to expect, but this is like a restaurant + lounge + bar combo kinda deal. all under 1 roof. lots of cute places to sit and very trendy/hipster vibes. 

we ended a weeklong trip out west with 1 night in Phoenix before flying home to good ole cincy. i scoured yelp for somewhere neat to eat, and Culinary Dropout came up. ordered the uber--who advised us to try out the location in Phoenix as opposed to the one in Tempe, which  she said would be dead due to college being out for summer. 

i started with a sour apple margarita. twas a margarita with chunks of green apple in it. refreshing, but not really anything outstanding. 

for our app we got the pork belly nachos, and these were the standouts of the meal. who doesn't love a heaping mound of nachos? more importantly--how can you mess up a heaping mound of nachos? my only comment is that i wish their had been more porky belly in them. wasn't a lot of meat for the price. 

for my main meal i got the black mussels. it said they were steamed in stella artois (nom) and had spicy sausage. again--not a lot of meat included in the dish. more disappointment. the mussels were good and flavorful and came with some grilled bread (which i could barely get down after nacho fest 2017), but i enjoyed it. 

the restaurant was quiet/nearly empty... probably due to the fact that we stopped in on a Wednesday night at 8 PM. i imagine this is a cool place on the weekend and shoulder-to-shoulder packed. 

anywho, twas a good meal in a neat location--if not a little skimpy on the meat for the cost of everything."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a drink with friends. When it comes to there entrees, I would pass. I love fox restaurants food, but culinary dropout always has bad food.   Last time I had the fried chicken and it was horrible. The mashed potatoes tasted like it was from a microwave dinner or from a airline.

Fun place to drink not to eat."}
{"text":"The drink menu is fantastic! And so are the nachos. This is a really cool place with great seating. Corn hole and ping pong as well. It was extremely loud in the outside area but I guess that's part of the charm for a big party scene. Excellent food either way."}
{"text":"Came twice in one week and got the pretzels with cheese dip both times. Both groups I came with enjoyed their food! Try it!"}
{"text":"First time to the Culinary Dropout and I really enjoyed it.  I am new to town and I will be bringing my guests from out of town here.  Love the atmosphere, the food is excellent.  I brought guests from out of town who are quite picky and everyone also enjoyed this very much.  Great food, great place."}
{"text":"Love CD! The only problem is that it's hard to get a good table during peak hours."}
{"text":"Can't give a good review... I showed up at 5:45 for a friends retirement dinner and didn't have my ID so I figured I'd just sit and have some food but the location that the party was \"the coop\" apparently doesn't even allow people in without ID so I had to leave the party and leave my girlfriend there to be with her family. I will never come back. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I will cut to the chase because there are many reviews here. Seared ahi tuna salad is not only the best thing I have eaten in a while, it may be the best salad I have ever had. Perfect balance in taste and texture. Lightly sweet, some wasabi kick, crunchy, creamy.. it simply had it all and I can't recommend it enough.
 
The place is loud and crowded, but modern and fun. Foodie without being prententious, and seems to have a little sense of humour. Live music was good and not at an overpowering volume. I am here in Tempe on business and came in strictly off Yelp reviews, and can't see how I won't come back again while I am in town. Service was on point.  Lots of nice choices on the beer menu. Also had the prosciutto deviled eggs, which were great."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3 stars for the food and but I'll give it five stars for fun! Depending on what your looking for this may be the spot for you! If you there to hang drink a few beers, eat a couple appetizers and play some yard games then you've found the right place! But it's called the culinary dropout for a reason lol! Just keeping it real!!!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit Culinary Dropout at The Yard earlier this year as part of a Yelp Elite event and I have been looking forward to coming back ever since. If you've never been to The Yard, then you need to check it out. Located in Central Phoenix close to Missouri and 7th Street, The Yard offers three distinct restaurants and a common patio area - a GREAT place to hang out with friends. On this recent visit, I took a small group of customers there for lunch. While I was leaning towards Barrio Urbano (SO amazing!) one of the guys in our group had just had Mexican food so we decided on Culinary Dropout. We were glad with the choice!

We started off with a few small bites: brussels sprouts, roasted beets, and truffle cheddar potato chips. The brussels sprouts were perfect roasted with a nice char on the outside. The beets were small cubes served with light balsamic finish. They  had a deep, earthy flavor that hit the spot. The chips were also very good, crisp and salty with shaved cheese on top (can't go wrong with that!) All in all, the snacks were very good - only $3 each but a little on the small side. I'm glad we got them all as starters.

For my lunch, I went with the seared tuna salad, a large bowl of greens served up with a light ginger vinaigrette, cashews and crunchy wasabi peas, topped with petite, delicate seared ahi medallions. The smooth taste of the tuna mixed with the fresh greens and dressing (with the occasional crunch) was wonderful and I was very satisfied.

The sandwiches also looked very good. One of my customers ordered the chicken club and it looked like a monster bacon cheeseburger with a grilled chicken breast in lieu of a beef patty. Cheese was oozing down all sides and it looked amazing. I might need to try that next time!

If you are in the Central Phoenix area and are looking for a cool place to hang out and enjoy some great gastro-pub fare, then look no further than Culinary Dropout at The Yard!

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"There are some seriously attractive women working here! That being said, when you walk in, it can be confusing with all the random rooms. Eventually I got to the main dining area and I was on a date so my date knew where to go. Waitress was so nice and REAL. The Fried chicken dinner in the menu warns you that you have to be patient for the chicken. The waitress said it would take 14 minutes but it arrived sooner. It arrived and looked good but the batter was waaay too thick and heavy. It was glazed with honey and the meat was tender and juicy. The chicken was hot. I had to get some siratcha to add flavor and the skin was way too crunchy. I recommend less flour. The mashed potatoes and gravy were excellent. I don't like cole slaw and didn't attempt to like it. My ginger and Jameson was amazing as always! My friend got the nachos and he couldn't finish it because it was so much! There were a lot of FLIES in the place and the air conditioning wasn't effective enough. I overall had a great experience though. The chicken at lo Lo's is better though"}
{"text":"Took my mom and my 7 year old here before a show at Gammage. The place was not crowded at all as it was Sunday afternoon.  The service was great (weird though having two waiters shadowing each other, kind of creepy) and the food was delish. Even my kid finished her plate. The ambience is super cool, and I wish there had been a band playing on the stage so we could have experienced the nighttime atmosphere during the day. I will definitly go back the next time I am in Tempe- wish we had some cool restaurants like this out in Peoria."}
{"text":"Only been here once as I was visiting from out of town, but what a great visit! The food was delicious and nothing short of filling -- I personally loved the pretzel rolls and monkey bread! The ambience is casual and the place is very modern looking and comfortable! We dined towards the back near the bar area, and it was great! My cousin held her wedding rehearsal dinner here and I would definitely return if I had a group with me. No complaints, the servers seemed very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Loved The Decor Decent Early HAPPY Hour 3 To 5 Drinks Well Priced & Some Appetizer Selection At Special Prices We Tried The Nachos But The Taste Were Odd Meat Was Sweet ...& Cheese A Mild Queso & Really Not Great  Pretty Disappointed. Tried The Dessert $9 4 A Small Slice of Banana Pie We May Go Back & Try Something Else.  And REALLY Yelpers??  Why Do I Get A Soup Spoon For A Desert Pie ??? Someone  Please Explain??? More Restaurant Do This After 15 Years in Catering & Fine Dining  Know We Put A Small Fork & Small Spoon  Above The dinner Plate    They Are called Desserts Fork ?Desert Spoon  ?Drives Me Crazy If I Order CHILI I Expect A Large SOUP Spoon So What will the Serve With Soup A Ladle ??? Just Saying ...?"}
{"text":"Service was OK, staff was nice.  Decent beer selection.  Food was pretty good.  Comfy chairs at the tables.  GOOD appetizer / tapas menu if you don't want to go with full dishes.  Note: I was here for lunch not dinner, not sure if the menu changes for dinner."}
{"text":"This place continues to amaze me. I eat out often, and go here often. The staff is incredible and well trained. The food is delicious, and the atmosphere is vibrant. No wonder you can't just walk in and sit down. 

Please keep this great food, service, and vibe going in the Farmers Art District. Don't know where to point you on food selection, except just pick one. 

Daniel, Christina, Kayla, and Tony, you guys rock."}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette party before a night out. It's a fun environment with interesting decor and live music on the Saturday evening we were there.

We ordered a lot of appetizers and my favorites included the pretzel bites, hummus and deviled eggs. Because the appetizers were so good I was very let down by my entree. 

I ordered the mussels and when I got them, the broth was lukewarm and the bread was hard. We didnt get all of the entrees at once so I wish they would have brought the mussels out when they were ready."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great big space.  2 hour wait on a Sunday unless you have reservations, then there are high top tables or you can be first come/first served at the bar.  Waiters were nice and friendly but super slow on getting food and drinks as well as not coming back to wait on us very often.  Many times drinks were empty and dirty plates were just chillin' extra long on our table."}
{"text":"it is a little hipster and over priced still worth the trip. Was here lately and the guy playing was very depressing. Seems like a great place for a corporate event"}
{"text":"So happy to have come across this place on my recent trip to Vegas! We had a party of 8, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food and drinks. Our server, Ben I think, was really awesome, super attentive, and really helpful with giving us ideas of places to check out! They have a nice range of food, from fried chicken to salads. I had the butternut squash and kale salad with salmon, which was deeeeeelicious! The best part was that it wasn't sopping in dressing like you normally get. Also, they make the best moscow mules! My favorite drink! The prices are also very reasonable, but the drinks are standard around 12+ per cocktail. The atmosphere is cool, they usually have someone playing live music up on stage, and right outside they have fire pits and couches where you can sit and relax. Would definitely come back here. Actually, I did, I went twice during my stay."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was great! Get the pretzel bites, SO good and so worth the extra calories"}
{"text":"The name says it all...Culinary Dropout. Even a person that barely gets by in culinary school can make better food than what I just ate here. 

To start the music was so damn loud I felt like I was at a club.  I couldn't hear the people at my own table. Next, we ordered a couple apps...nothing special there. I actually have to say that the mediocre apps were the best part of the meal. For my entree, I ordered the \"sweet\" corn cannelini. The corn and tomatoes that were in my dish were rancid and spoiled. Apparently the kitchen staff doesn't know how to properly rotate their product. It had such a sour taste. So I left it and proceeded to eat the pasta. I made it past 3 and had to stop because they apparently dumped a whole gallon of kosher salt on it. This dish should be called \"spoiled, rancid and salty\" corn cannelini. It was disgusting. My husband ordered the fried chicken. This was not even made to order. This was most likely done before service and kept under a heat lamp or a hotbox for the remainder of the service. Awful food. I will never go back."}
{"text":"This is a very noises restaurant!  Patio seating is the way to go because the heat lamps are warm and its great people watching. Great beer selection!  I think the antipasto menu is the way to go if I ever return. 
Not the best of the Fox restaurants but it's crowded on a week night so there must be done hidden gem I missed."}
{"text":"Just ok. Good drinks but the food was sub par. The nachos were terrible. Basically cheez whiz and the meat was only on 1/4 of the nachos. Ehhh won't be back. 
The grissini from the apps were the only good thing on the menu. 
Italian salad was ok...not enough salad as it was mostly meat."}
{"text":"Came with my large family the night before ASU's graduation.  Still waiting on our waiter.  20 minuets so far."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. We are here a few nights while staying at the hard rock. Happy hour has great prices. I wish could remember our servers name. Spunky tattooed male. He took great care of us. I really liked the caramel custard with caramel corn! Yummy. Not sure if it's all the time but if you have backstage pass with the hotel...free pretzels with fondue. Deliciousness"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are moving to the Tempe area and we wanted to check out a restaurant while looking at apartments. We decided to try Culinary Dropout and we were glad we did!
We ordered three appetizers: Thai chili wings, hummus, and house potato chips. The wings were amazing! Saucy and a little crispy above a bed of cabbage. The hummus was tasty as well except there wasn't enough pita for the amount of hummus given and the $9 price tag is a little steep. The house potato chips were good as well, I loved the onion dip.
I ordered a drink - the jalapeño lemonade something in which I was pleasantly surprised! It was refreshing with a little kick of spice.

As for the service, no complaints. Our server was attentive without being overbearing. 

I'd love to check this place out when the live music is happening! Definitely will be back. :)"}
{"text":"This place is great. It's a young semi classy environment located right across the street from the mall. Our service was excellent (shout out to our server) and the food was just as good. The only down side was that we really didn't want to stick around for 10 & 11$ drinks all afternoon. Which were good but not worth it."}
{"text":"Beautiful people, chic decor, and above average food.  The tried and true Fox formula.

Highlight:  Butternut Squash Cannelloni"}
{"text":"Holy shit. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch, and Jesus Christ we'll never come back. We have both bartended and served in the industry for 5 and 6 years, respectively, we tend to go into places with an open mind toward what a place has to offer. 
First off, our server was training a new girl, which usually means better service, you're getting a two for one for gods sake! At the very least you get 1 1/2 times the service because one of them is learning. But sweet Jesus we ended up with 1/2 what we would expect from a single server. They disappeared for long periods at a time, we had to specifically ask for napkins after receiving finger foods, and NEVER got silverware, at any point in time. We got our appetizers and watched it get cold as we continued to wait for our FIRST round of cocktails. 
Apparently the bartender was training as well, those two menu ready cocktails took over 20 minutes (yes, we looked at the time) in a restaurant that was MAYBE 1/10 capacity, including the indoor, outdoor, AND bar seating. 
The drinks were so unbalanced I wanted to smack whomever trained the trainer AND trainee of those bartenders. It's hard to fuck up an old fashioned once you know how to make it, but watered down whiskey with a bourbon cherry on top does NOT an old fashioned make, my friend. 
The menu and cocktail list, along with the quirky name, seemed to have the potential to be a great restaurant and cocktail stop. But the service was horrendous. If this restaurant were not riding on the back of the Hard Rock Casino big brother, I would laugh at the blatant foreshadowing of a business ready to close its doors before the idea could blossom into a singularly successful business. Beyond the total disregard for anything mimicking customer and/or industry service, to see new additions being trained to act as such was blasphemous for all proper restaurants and bars in the world. 

Shame on you and your mooch business model mentality, that clearly relies on a presence inside of a large, profitable casino, that overrides the necessity for an individual attempt at creating a thriving business with a staff worth regarding."}
{"text":"First and foremost I would like to say that the pretzel fondue is amazing...although it is something familiar that I have tasted before so I wouldnt go out of your way to go here. Their drink combinations are pretty good. Their food is small portions for the price! Atmosphere is unique and almost every table has a different set of chairs and style which is different. 

The reason I am giving Culinary a terrible review in stars is because my poor boyfriend got food poisoning from the Beef Stroganoff! We came into AZ to re visit my college town and friends and he was out all day saturday, most of sunday, and still not up to par on Monday! I realize this was not their fault that their food was possibly contaminated, however, it was the aftermath that I was unhappy with...

I called the restaurant to talk to the manager....he didnt seem to sympathetic with saying things like \"did he go to the hospital?\" or \"I served 27 of that dish Saturday Night and I have not had one complaint yet.\".....definitely not looking for any type of discount but with working in customer service for 10 years that is NOT the way to handle things. He was proceeding to tell me the length of time it can take and how it could have been from something earlier that day or the night before...really?! Needless to say even though I did not feel sick from the food I will NEVER return to this restaurant again!!! I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Incredible atmosphere and food.

What peeved me about this place is if you order an appetizer and drinks, the food always came out first--something that is really confusing for me.  Not to mention the poor service that came along with it.  I came here to celebrate my birthday and left rather quickly because the drinks were coming out so slow.  Our waitress was very nice, but she had no interest in actually doing any work... 

And to throw one more thing on top of it, I showed her my email from fox that stated I was entitled to a free dessert... She never brought me out the menu again so I could choose one. Anyways, by this time I was ready to move onto the next place!"}
{"text":"In LAS for my GF's B-Day and she chose this place before a show. I made a reservation on their web site which asked for \"special requests\"  in which l mentioned the B-Day.
There was never any mention of my special request on arrival, so I assumed that l wasted my time and didn't want to give an impression of \"gaming something free\". They were not busy. 
The server was very friendly and asserted that everything was fresh and cooked to order. We ordered the potato chips which promptly arrived cold and unsalted. We were told that they are made in advance and if wanted them fresh and hot we had to request that. 
The main courses were very good and large in size. Best things are the Meatloaf and Ribs. 
One other problem...... this is located in the Hard Rock Casino. If you use rideshare you have a very long walk to a special pickup zone in a smoky indoor parking lot, not the convenient main entrance."}
{"text":"Brunch is where Culinary Dropout shines! The Kentucky Hot Brown and the Smoked Salmon Avocado Toast are truly amazing. If you are craving something savory, you can't go wrong with either of these options! Also, the portion sizes are super generous. I split each dish with a friend and each half serving easily could have passed for a full portion.

I'm not personally a fan of Culinary Dropout's dinner options. Compared to their brunch options, the dinner choices seem a tad overpriced. However, they do have good happy hour deals and their outdoor games make it a great place to decompress after work.

Try to keep an eye out for events here--last month they had a free series of yoga class from CorePower Yoga. They even gave out free drink tickets just for going to the event!"}
{"text":"Super nice. Great staff and food. Love the menu. 

Second trip did not disappoint. Best drink - Partly Cloudy. 

Waitress: Brittney very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"Only reason for 3 stars was because the server was excellent. As far as the food goes we got the pretzel and cheese which was good and also the chicken and shrimp skewers were good. The eggs and crusty bread were some of the worst I have ever had. Francesca the server at least made the experience decent so props to her on the service. Sadly will not be returning for dinner anytime soon. If you do come in I would ask for her as a server."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place... great atmosphere, food and entertainment"}
{"text":"Seriously this is the first restaurant I've visited two times in one day whilst travelling. The Brunch, vibe, atmosphere was so compelling I had to see if the same could be said for dinner - It can be. Well done. So good I may leave Miami for a month next winter and move to Phoenix / Tempe. Menu? Broad enough top bistro fare for anyone - every plate a work of art. Try it asap !"}
{"text":"My wife and I have ate here three times now and it's been great every time! Most recently we sat out outside near a green wall with a pool view. Great vibes, great atmosphere, and great service. Gina is awesome!  Will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"I wish they had more vegan options, but a custom off-the-menu salad was the only way to go. I asked our waitress about vegan options, but she said she didn't know of any. So, it was time to get creative.  I ordered a salad with romaine lettuce, pistachios, sour apples and ginger vinaigrette.  It was super tasty. If they had more vegan-friendly items on the menu, I would go here all the time! I'd love to see a veggie burger, tofu entree or entree with an eggplant or mushroom main dish on the menu."}
{"text":"I had the most phenomenal server and service at Culinary Dropout. Our waiter Michael was incredible, he was attentive, patient and efficient throughout the entire evening. The evening started out with my reservation of 12 turning into a party of 22, while most servers would flip out or become agitated Michael just maintained composure. Seriously this guy has mastered the art of multitasking! 

The food was fresh, delicious and super hot when it came to our table. There were so many people I felt like I got to try everything on the menu. I sampled the wings, salad and a bite of the burger, all of which were amazing. But let's be honest the pub burger with bacon and bbq sauce was where the money was at. 

It's not a question of if I'll go back to this place, it's a matter of when. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hard Rock and checked out Yelp to figure out where to stop in for a quick dinner with my friends. I loved the chill vibe and cute decor of the restaurant. We checked out their patio but opted to sit indoors....the patio is super cute and has a great view of the pool. Now to the food....it was so good! I enjoyed every dish we ordered to share. The highlights were the artichoke app, turkey pastrami and the sweet corn pasta. The only complaint that I have is that it was tad warm in the dining area. Other than that...I def recommend for a casual dinner that has great food options!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a find. Noisy by intent, but the food is excellent. If a restaurant has the courage to put fish and chips on the menu then I will judge them on that dish. These guys did it right. Big chunks of tender fish in a light beer batter, home made chips and probably the best Cole slaw in the city. The food is not sophisticated, once again, by design, but there is something for everyone. Good selection of on tap beers and an entertaining bar staff. Beautiful women greet you and everyone is friendly and obviously enjoy their jobs. Will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome experience. So much to do. Endless choice of drinks and spirits to choose from. If you're having second thoughts on food from the Microbrewery, you have Little Cleos (seafood) and Barrio (Mexican) all within a few feet from the entrance. The atmosphere is really cool! 

My girlfriend and I chose to come here for a Friday night date night. We arrived around 8 and didn't have to wait for a table which was nice. We were sat inside, by the window. The noise level inside was extremely loud and my girlfriend and I had to sit next to one another so that we could hear one another. Even then, we struggled to hear each other. They had live music playing which was likely the reason for the noise difficulty. Vinyl Station was the band that performed. Incredible. Though it was loud overall, vinyl station set the mood. Peaceful, acoustic vibes. I had just mentioned the band to my girlfriend. Really cool to eat dinner and listen to some local jams. 

We ordered the pretzels & Fondue as an appetizer. Always a win if you get these. The cheese is outstanding and the pretzels are soft, warm, and delicious. The bowl is huge so make sure you don't fill up on these before your dish comes out! The food came not long after ordering.  We were impressed. I ordered the Sweet Corn Ravioli and my lady ordered the Prime Rib sandwich. I really enjoyed my ravioli. Sweet. My girlfriend enjoyed her sandwich but she felt the sandwhich had to much mayo.  The mayo was good tasting there was just too much for her preference. Still enjoyed her meal as did I. 

The service was exceptional. Our waiter was gracious, speedy, and thorough. He offered to box up our food but we graciously declined the offer as we were still slowly working on our plates. Our waiter knew what he was doing. Always made sure our needs were met. Great experience. 

If you're looking for a little fun, different then your typical Applebee's, or Sizzler, this is your place. They have ping pong, corn-hole, massive Jenga, and a huge outdoor patio. They have a great local selection of beer and live music on the weekends. Well done Sam Fox, well done. ."}
{"text":"I am a fan!  I love the atmosphere of this place, casual and relaxed.  It was a comfortable environment to sit back, have some fun food and try a good beer.  My friend and I went during happy hour, it was perfect.  The food was simple and good.  The beer was excellent.  The door to the pool was open but I was not hot.  It was a pleasant experience and I would definitely go back.  Pretzels and cheese?  Awesomeness!  Oh, and it was not insanely busy or too crowded."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to complain about a restaurant, but I was honestly so disappointed with my experience at your CD this past Friday night. My girlfriend and I had just gotten off work at 1130PM (we work in the industry too) and wanted to grab a quick drink/food before you restaurant closed at 12AM. We arrived at CD at 1140PM and quickly sat ourselves at the bar. As soon as we sat down, the first thing the male bartender said to us was, \"Hey guys, just to let you know, the kitchen is closing in 15 min so you BETTER hurry if you want to get some food.\" I have never been told that at a restaurant before---especially on a friday night in OLD TOWN SCOTTSDALE. I know it doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but it made my girlfriend and I feel very rushed. We quickly ordered drinks and food all at one time. Our drinks were then made by a female bartender who rarely spoke to us throughout the meal and never did a 2 min quality check. Thankfully, the food and drinks tasted amazing, but that is what we have come to expect from CD (We have eaten here many times).  When we ordered our second round of drinks, the female bartender rolled her eyes, and acted like we were inconveniencing her since she was closing down the bar.  

Being in the industry, I don't normally write reviews like this.  I understand how frustrating it is when a guest walks in 15 min before closing, but with that said, I have never treated a guest that way. You are open till 12am.  Every guest experience should be the same whether you just opened or you are about to close.   This is the HOSPITALITY industry.  

I love the food and drinks at CD, and I will probably always continue to come back simply for the food. The service that night was definitely lacking, and I'm writing this in hopes that the issues can be addressed and the service can be improved. Thank you."}
{"text":"I've been to every Culinary Dropout location, and this is one is definitely my favorite! The yard is a great touch to this location - especially when the weather is great. Today, we came for a Friday happy hour and had a great time! Our waitress, Izzy, provided great service and always made sure our drinks were full. She even was accommodating with moving us to a larger table when an extra friend joined us! The vibe is great for laid back, social people that are looking for a fun place to play games, eat great food, and hang at the bar. I recommend grabbing a drink and some food at the bar before heading over to the yard for a game of corn hole! Be careful on the weekends though, it can get super busy!! However, this place is definitely worth a wait."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and lovely live music.   I little loud and dark.   I would go again. Very busy- plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Walked up to the hostess and she immediately looked excited and said \"I just had a table open up by the fire for you 2\" (my husband and I). I told her we were just there for drinks and weren't sure if we needed to order food and she told us it was fine. As we walked back through the restaurant I could finally see why she was excited. Two luxurious high back chairs sitting by the fire were waiting for us. Very romantic and our waitress was very friendly. I recommend the Dropout Mule made with their very own ginger agave.  Cocktails were $12 a piece but the ambience made that price VERY worthwhile."}
{"text":"The Mac Burger was like combining grilled cheese and a double burger.  So delicious I did not even add any ketchup."}
{"text":"Went to dinner at the Culinary Dropout last night. Had a truly amazing time. the atmosphere was truly amazing. The wings, pretzels and yesterday's soup was delicious. The staff was very happy and the food was delicious. The outdoor area is very large and had a lot of corn hole and ping pong tables. I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"The mussels here are fantastic! They are tender and juicy and mixed with delicious chorizo sausage chunks, but the star of the show was the savory broth lying below. It was my first time having mussels and Culinary Dropout provided a delicious first experience with them! I also had the salmon bruschetta and the cheese plate. The cheese plate had less cheese than I expected, but I got it for a happy hour price so I'm not too upset, just wouldn't order it again. The smoked salmon bruschetta was very tasty and I would recommend it. I had their sangria, and for 4 dollars a glass I definitely feel like I got my moneys worth! It was tasty and strong. My dining partner was entertained by the paperbag special ($1.95 for a random beer in a paperbag), and was able to have 3 beers for 6 bucks which is nearly unheard of when dining out. 

My only complaint was the service and that's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. The restaurant wasn't particularly busy when I went as it was earlier in the evening on a weeknight but I wasn't able to order a few things I wanted to try (like the Korean Shrimp and Chicken on a stick) because our waitress visited maybe every 25 minutes, if not a little longer. My dining partner had to ask the runner who brought out the the mussels for another drink because our waitress was no where to be found.   I wanted to order toasted bread (to mop up the delicious mussel broth) but by the time the waitress returned it had been quite awhile and we felt like we were inconveniencing her somehow.

Service aside, the food and drinks are tasty and I highly recommend this as a happy hour stop for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Trendy, Relaxing, and Really Good Food!


The Culinary Dropout is one of my favorite places and is a Fox Restaurant Concept, generally known for more upscale type establishments.  The atmosphere at Culinary Dropout  is really trendy, relaxing, and cool.  

My friends and I were famished, so we opted to order some the pretzels with provolone fondue and it excellent.  I couldnt get enough of the pretzels, and if I hadn't had an entree coming, I probably would have polished off the whole order by myself.

As an entree I ordered the chicken club sandwich which came with a chicken breast, ham and bacon.  It was quite good.  My lunch companion had the fried chciken, and mac & cheese and it equally delicious.

The service was perfect-our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.  We will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Too loud and too overpriced. That said, food is great. I miss the MAC Burger....PLEASE bring it back. Wait staff is a tad bit pretentious but fitting for the place. This place beats Lucky s 24-7 coffee shop which I detest."}

The Culinary Dropout was recommended by a friend and is a Fox Restaurant Concept, generally known for more upscale type establishments.  The atmosphere at Culinary Dropout  is really trendy and cool, even our server had a cool name \"Slade\". We decided to eat outside in order to avoid a wait and to take advantage of one of the rare occasions when you can eat on the patio in Phoenix, Arizona, in August.

My friends and I were famished, so we opted to order some of the house-made potato chips and the pretzels with provolone fondue.  Both of these appetizers were excellent.  I couldnt get enough of the pretzels, and if I hadn't had an entree coming, I probably would have polished off the whole order by myself.

{"text":"what a fun place! I think it was genius to create the 'yard'. The bar can get pretty packed but the staff is pretty respectful and considerate. I love the live music, completes the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Bad service waited for a drink for over an hour food was just ok. I had the fried chicken and waiter stated it was the best he's ever had \"boo\""}
{"text":"Not sure what all the other reviewers see or why this place is to popular.  For me when I go out to eat I want something with good flavor served with attentive staff.  The later was OK but unfortunately the food fell short.  I had the ribs they were served cold and clearly made with no seasoning where they expected the sauce to do all that after they were cooked.  The sauce did have good flavor but not enough to make up for the poor prep of the ribs. The sides were also nothing special.  My son had the pork belly nachos.  The pork was just regular old shredded pork and the cheese sauce was just that... a sauce.  Possibly Velveeta.  Pork belly when cooked well can be quite tasty but shredded pork is not pork belly. There is a good drink selection and fun games to play if you like that sort of thing.  Overall the food was average but not enough to recommend to others."}
{"text":"Food & drinks are amazing here!! I got great service too! Try the pretzel bites and the pastrami sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"This place was super cute. The Bartender Dilian took great care of my party. Every drink that he offered was delicious, he started to make my Monkey See Monkey Do a double. This made my drink amazing I fell in love.  My favorite drink at the moment. I also had the potato chips and dip which was good, very crunchy and flavorful. The patio was beautiful, they have a couple of fire pits that you can sit around which keeps you warm during he cold months.  I can't wait until the summertime because the pool is a couple steps away, a new hang out spot."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour which runs from 3 to 6. Good drinks and food at great prices. Can make your on antipasto plate from a number of selections. Meatloaf sandwich also very good. Recommend the smoked salmon bruschetta and the deviled eggs with prosciutto."}
{"text":"cool place, house potato chips are delicious, big open bar with plenty of seating, definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We had 4 families and it was perfect for the kids/teens to play ping pong, bean bags and shuffle board. The drinks and food are wonderful.  We ordered brussel sprouts, cheese fondue and deviled eggs to start. Order extra because they are single portions.  We had the ribs, fish and chips and Italian grinder. All fantastic.  The waitress and the atmosphere made for a perfect night."}
{"text":"Let me first say food is good and cocktail menu was great. Unfortunately service was so terrible I can't return. They don't have anyone walking around to order drinks or get any kind of assistance so the only option is to walk up to the bar. Blonde bearded Bartender seemed annoyed or inconvenienced any time we came to the bar to order a drink- lots of eye rolls and sighs. Then after we closed out the bartender called me over to ask why we didn't tip him more. Seriously called out to me from across the room and waved me over. Our tip wasn't over generous but was fair for our total bill. I was shocked, it was a Wednesday night and wasn't incredibly busy. Wish this wouldn't have been my first experience."}
{"text":"The food and service is awesome.  You must try the pretzels with provolone cheese they are the best.   I have had the fried chicken and cuban before must haves.  The wife had the grilled cheese sliders she loved them.  Get the caramel popcorn for dessert.  One to eat there and one to take home.  Great prices great eats.  Oh yeah you can get beer in a paper bag for like 2 bucks........"}
{"text":"This place has the best food! The wait can sometimes be very long, but it's worth it. I hate seeing reviews that give low ratings just because of long waits. This place is worth the wait! We love the pretzel bites and their fries. Great beers on tap and you can play games like Corn hole, table tennis, foosball, and shuffle board before or after your meal. Get there early though if you plan on playing games as they get checked out quickly!"}
{"text":"I ate and drank at the Coop inside Culinary Dropout. I small bar dedicated to the 21 up crowd. It was a full service bar so I was able to indulge in a adult beverage and food. 

The EATS: I had the black mussels (captured in photos) with spicy sausage. The plate portion was great but each individual mussels were small (not the fault of the restaurant, just want to be as descriptive as possible for the next guest). I felt the mussels where on the bland side.

DRANK DRANK: I really had fun with this experience. The Bartender gent was patient with my indecisiveness. He put me on to the Bee's Knees cocktail (also captured in photos). It was refreshing and crisp. He explained in detail was the recipe called for and it was a perfect suggestion. Just hoped he crafted the drink in front of me just to give that extra gusto (everyone loves presentation)!"}
{"text":"While the food here is good, the service experience I had last night was disappointing. Met some friends here with my wife for dinner. Had 7:30 reservation. Food served 8:45.  Music so loud on patio we couldn't hear for ordering or conversation. Asked politely twice if it could be turned down a bit to no avail.  Not what we've come to expect from Fox restaurant concepts."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to this place. Their food is excellent and is always served hot (which is always an issue at a lot of places). All of the food options are excellent and so delicious! The pretzel and cheese fondue is on my list each and every time! Love!"}
{"text":"First off, walking into the restaurant I was so shocked at how gorgeous it was. The large lights, the stage for a mic night, a grassy area for games, and chandeliers and large beautiful lights hanging from the ceiling. The bathrooms have really nice sinks and bathroom doors (strange i know but you gotta go there and see for yourself lOL)

Ok I was kinda salty that they dont give you straws when serving you water.... o.o i spilled everywhere like a little kid lol (mayb its just me but i like straws ok). 

The servers wear casual clothes which has its down and up sides to it. It gives the restaurant a more casual and laid back feel but at the same time I dont know who's a worker and who's a customer because everyones dressed in their own clothes...

I ordered the 36-Hour Pork Ribs and the House Smoked Salmon. The Pork ribs were 25$ which is a bit pricey for how a majority of the ribs is ribs and barely any meat.. but i mean its ribs but still. lol. it came with fries and it was way too salty ):

The House smoked salmon waS boOoOoMBBBB. Bread, egg, salmon, sour cream, tomato altogether was just kjsalkjsdfhlkjsd so good. I enjoyed this dish very much. no regrets. 

I would definitely come back to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Let's get the cons out of the way:  

I know it's Phoenix, but winter nights get cold. You would figure they would invest in a few stand heaters for the game area. It was so cold last night that they sent the staff in the game area home. Which sucks because that's where our birthday party was. 

The fire pit/couch areas are taken. All the time. I can't even imagine what time you have to get there to snag one. 

The wait to get a table...there aren't words. People were in line forever, and it was bitter cold, since (you guessed it) no heaters out front either.

And now for the great stuff:

The pretzel balls (it's like 4 bites per ball!) and cheese fondue were delicious. Unfortunately the outside temperature meant the fondue was pretty solid in 10 minutes. Still, great flavor.

The fried chicken was insane. Crunchy, delicious perfection in every bite with just a kiss of honey to top it off. The potatoes were great and so was the biscuit. Only downside was that my whole plate was cold about 2-3 bites in. Still, absolutely great.

I had the Sauvignon Blanc since I didn't have a drink menu, but the people who ordered beer seemed happy with it. 

In short, if you can figure out the \"off\" nights so you can get inside quickly for a table, or if you know how to get a fire pit table this place is amazing."}
{"text":"Cute place with excellent food and service.

We found the delicious food to be on the heavier size - for example, their infamous pretzel bites with cheese fondue is worth the weight ;-)   My husband and I ended up getting a few small things instead of an entree after starting with that, but everything we had was amazing!!  Their Antipasti are a la carte, which is perfect because you can choose only things you like - especially nice for vegetarians!

Great experience for a friend's birthday - really excellent service for our large party, great food, great drinks, and a nice, boisterous atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place but the live music is WAYYHY TOOO LOUD. Unbearably LOUD. Couldn't even hear the server."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Not what I expect from a Sam Fox restaurant.
We got there around 8 pm on a Monday night. The hostess was going to sit us right away but we then asked if we can try to sit outside. She said it was first come first serve. We thought we could try it outside since the misters were on. Once we got out there and sat down for 2 mins (we didn't even have time to order a drink), we decided it was way too hot. We went back inside and the hostess told us in a very unpleasant manner that it now would be a 25-30 minute wait for a table (even though the place was empty and there were clearly various 6 top tables available). We didn't want to wait 25 - 30 mins so we decided to go back outside and literally sweat it out. 
Waiter was very friendly and attentive - he was the best thing about the night. 
We got our drinks and order our apps - wings without nuts since one our friends had a peanut allergy. Guess what we got? Wings with nuts sprinkled all over. They got sent back and new wings came out. We then ordered our food. One of the plates was the grill cheese sliders - we asked to have it without bacon and tomatoes. Guess what we got? Grill cheese with bacon and tomatoes. That also got sent back and the kitchen argued that the order was right. The waiter had to prove himself with the meal ticket. Meanwhile we are still sweating in the 100 degree outdoor patio and the 6 top tables inside are still empty - actually no one ever sat in them at all! When I finally complained to the Manager she apologized and took 35% off the bill. I honesty think at this point the dinner should have been comped. We should have had to pay for the drinks but the food should have been taken off the bill. 
I was looking forward to experiencing this place since I heard so many good things about it and it was a huge disappointment!  I hope Sam Fox and his team can get it together because it is a great concept!"}
{"text":"The locations in Scottsdale and Las Vegas are better period.  4 of us ordered a meat and cheese board, trout, 2 fried chicken dishes, a sandwich (can't remember) and some drinks.  The chicken was good not great.  It's been great at the other locations.  The server brought our first round and it took 20 minutes for a couple of old fashioned's, a manhattan and beers.  We told the server that we would appreciate light on the simple syrup because we don't care for sweet cocktails.  We want to taste the whiskey.  They were still too sweet.  Asked again and brought us manhattans instead old fashioned's.  Tried to tell us that they were the correct drink. He was maybe young 20's and barely knew what each drink was made with.  Trust me we were given the wrong drinks.  The trout was disgusting and excessively salty.  Told the server and figured he would get a manger or take it off the bill.  Guess what, neither happened.  He asked if we wanted a box for it and we repeated its gross and salty.  Brought us the bill and we said fuck it.  We had plans and tickets so we left.  Disappointing experience.  Won't come back here."}
{"text":"I would like to say the managers at The Culinary Dropout (7135 E Camelback Rd
Scottsdale, AZ 85251) really change my perception of the restaurant for the best.  After a less than desirable experience, Haley the manager invited us back to the restaurant for a meal and drink. The food and experience was amazing. The salmon is a must try and of course my favorite Classic Moscow Mule. Thank you Haley Z. and the other manager for inviting us back. You will see  us again.

{"text":"Been here 3 times in the last several days.  Very cool place with an urban feel but very roomy and sophisticated in it's own way.  The French Dip and burger were both very good.  The fries were awesome as well.  The brunch was tasty, eggs and bacon, French toast, coffee, mimosa's, and more.  The employees are very friendly and helpful too.  Will try the locations in AZ for sure."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great service and food in a really fun setting. The appetizers were delicious and reasonably priced. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had a great meal here!
I started with the cheap salad as I was craving salad.  HIt the spot.
Hubby started with smashed irishman drink and loved.  He moved onto a draft beer.
I moved onto Fish and Chips-they were light and just the right size.
Hubby had beef stroganoff-he said it was tasty.
We ended with the fabulous salted caramel-my fav thing of the night.
I think the bill was $62 before tip-pretty reasonable to me."}

{"text":"What a great place to hang out and eat !  Loved the ambiance and the food was fantastic.  Went here for dinner prior to going to a concert.  Came back after the concert was over and hung out on the patio. I will definitely come back here !"}
{"text":"Nice service but the food not the best. Both dishes were just meh, very bland and not tasty. They have very few options as for dinner dishes. And, everything is way overpriced! Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is fun! Good, solid comfort food (that came much faster than I anticipated). 
The brown bag special was fun, not a good beer, but fun none the less. Very impressed with the food, I had the fish and chips and the fish was super moist and it wasn't battered to death. Very much going to this place again."}
{"text":"Just had lunch today, it was good at best though
nothing special, very limited menu and nothing
for vegetarians, vegans, missing the boat ?
Couple issues, place smelled gassy, not a good
smell and water they serve tasted weird, I like
to take people to dependable places, today was
nothing special and will choose other options
next time because this was pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"Fox Restaurant Concepts has been very succesful at developing small regional groups of eateries like Culinary Dropout in AZ and True Food Kitchen in CA. They have numerous
other gems in their line up and do a good job of creating formulas that work. They key is that you don't feel like you are dining at a chain, it is more personal. This location does brisk business most nights and the weekends are quite busy. 
A reservation is a good idea, as wait is more the norm than the exception. Live music is featured on some nights and be prepared, it's loud to the point of distraction even in the dining area. We did have a small wait, 20 minutes, even with a reservation but just grabbed a drink at the bar. 
The menu is loaded with the latest and greatest of the current trends and some twists on comfort food favorites. Things aren't overly priced either so that is a bonus. I met up with some old work buddies during a recent visit to Scottsdale.  
 This Salad was definitely big enough to be an entree salad when paired with an appetizer or two. Hearty, flavorful, satisfying and not overly dressed it was excellent!   
BUTTERNUT SQUASH & KALE  Salad with  pear, Brussels sprouts, goat cheese,
pecan, caramelized honey vinaigrette and I added the smoked salmon for 5 bucks.

they could have been prepped a tad better. Great flavors however and a minor quibble.

{"text":"I have now been here 2 times for lunch and although I had an overall decent  exprerience, they have a lot to improve on. First of all, we got there about 11:45 (party of 3) and had to wait 15 minutes, the place was not even very full. They 1st said all the 4-tops which surround the bar  (in & out)....about 10 ( which were empty) were reserved. Then after I went back to ask if we could sit there they said they were short staffed! We ended up sitting inside & not one of the 5-4 tops (inside) was ever used?? Don't get this! They definitely need to up their staff! Next thing is that while one person ordered the meatloaf which was a decent portion, another ordered the buttersquash ravioli which had about 8 small ravioli. I don't need extra large portions but felt it was quite lacking for the price (also feel the food is a bit overpriced for lunch). We ordered bread & olive oil which is $2.00, feel this should be complimentary (think the delicious bread & pesto at Olive & Ivy)...it was very good but this is flat out chintzy!  Service was just ok, the server would come then be gone for a long time. A little too loud as well, with concrete floors I had trouble hearing the person across from me.

This place has a ton of potential, cool vibe, lots of space....hopefully they get it together & provide better service!"}
{"text":"Super cool place to grab a good bite and great drinks. Fun atmosphere with corn hole and ping pong available. Open air feel, still indoors so it's perf for Az hot summers."}
{"text":"My friend and I went in yesterday morning for the first time and we were graciously served by Tyler! Tyler was fun and very informative. We ordered pretzels with cheese to dip in and they were delicious! I ordered the ahi salad...yummy:) Loved that you all had ping pong tables. We will be back for sure! Thanks Tyler:)"}
{"text":"The food at this place was so good!  I had the turkey pastrami sandwich and my husband had the fried chicken.  We shared the BBQ pork nachos.  Everything was delicious.  The servers were very nice and our food was brought out quickly.  It has a great atmosphere.  Our only complaint was that it was sooo loud.  Even sitting right next to each other, it was hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"We met some friends/clients for dinner. I gave this 3 stars but would break it down this way. Food 4/5. Location 3.5/5 as parking was just a little rough. There was a very eclectic vibe to the waitstaffs style. Everything from ladies in an a nice summer dress, to a young lady practically in a bra and cut off shorts. Guys were equally eclectic. But some were FAR from professional attire, so business meetings might be better elsewhere. I gave that a 2/5. Atmosphere is nice inside and out, but with the music it was just WAY to loud. 1.5/5. We were all hollering over each others tables to talk to our company. The live music is all good, just too loud. Over all, it was decent, but will probably try some of the surrounding restaurants before we go back."}
{"text":"Coolest bar/restaurant in a 10 min drive vicinity.

Ordered -
Brussel sprout snacks : tasted very very delicious. Quantity was too good for the price. Being a vegetarian I did not have lot many options though. 

Smashed Irishman - not a big fan of Jameson, but this place changed my opinion. Totally loved it.

Good ambience and music."}
{"text":"I went here with a party of 5 for my birthday last night.  I made the reservation almost 2 weeks ago, and when I did, they asked if we were celebrating anything.  I told the hostess yes, my birthday.  When we arrived on time for dinner last night, there were at least 8 large, comfortable, empty tables with big, inviting, upholstered chairs in the restaurant that would have accommodated us.  However, we were shown to a table for 4 barely inside the front door.  There were only 4 seats at the table, so they brought in a cold wicker chair from outside for me to sit on.  We were then told that the other half of the restaurant had been \"bought out\" which was why we were seated in such a ridiculous way...they sure knew how to make me feel special for my birthday!  In addition, even though they had asked me what we were celebrating, not one time during the entire night did any employee acknowledge my birthday in any way.  I could really care less, since I don't need restaurant employees to make a fuss over my birthday to make it special, but why ask if you're just going to forget it altogether?  

The food and drinks were excellent, as usual, and the prices are very fair, however the seating arrangement really irritated me, and our service was sub-par.  Our server was assigned to the large party once they finally arrived and pretty much forgot we were there.  Once she dropped our check off at the table, we waited over 15 minutes for her to come pick up the credit card.  Finally I got tired of waiting and walked it over to her.  She was completely non-apologetic and much more concerned with chatting with her co-worker.  

I typically enjoy this restaurant, but really wish I had chosen somewhere else for my birthday celebration this year.  I don't enjoy being treated like a second class citizen."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a cap'n crunch French toast along with a grapefruit mimosa. The big projector was streaming football on the stage. My server was so cute I fell a little in love wth her laid back attitude and she was helpful regarding my questions with portion size. The seating was very relaxing and comfortable. The lighting is perfect and can't wait to eat outside once they open their patio to warmer weather."}
{"text":"First impressions are always important, and I was wowed by the Gothic meets Modern meets British Invasion decor. In fact, I liked it so much that it may have colored my opinion on the restaurant quite a bit. 

For starters I had the soft pretzels with cheese fondue which was so delicious! You get a basket of large pretzel pieces and a substantial pot of cheese. More than enough for two people!

Then I had the Chicken Gorgonzola salad. It was the perfect cool dish for a hot summer day. I wish it had a few more apple slices in it, but over all it was a great salad with the perfect amount of dressing. 

Our waiter was attentive, but it could have been because the restaurant was pretty empty relative to it's size. Although I imagine that it is packed on weekend nights.

I was also pleased that they brought out black napkins for me since I was wearing black pants. It was a thoughtful touch!

I can't wait to go back and try something off of their extensive cocktail menu! Too bad drinking isn't acceptable during working hours!"}
{"text":"The food here is AWESOME!!!

The service here is SLOOOW due to the hipster mentality of the servers.

BYE, BYE"}
{"text":"Not sure how to put 0 stars.. terrible food, very slow service. Manager is extremely nice but didn't change the fact that food was bad and multiple extra charges on checkout.. pay attention to your bill and beware. I"}
{"text":"Every time I've gone here, usually week nights, there's always an initial and pungent smell of vomit possibly from last nights lets-go-have-dinner-turn-crazy-night-on-the-town vibe I get from this place.

Once I overcame the smell and was seated from the strangely under-dressed hostess, our waiter came to get our order in an even stranger bandana jean look that was very curious.

We started with the pretzel Gouda fondue appetizer.  Very gooey and delicious as expected, maybe too much salt, but gooey and delicious.  He had the salmon and I tried the French Dip.  The salmon was delicious and none was left on the plate.  I'm a sucker for French Dips, the one's that melt in your mouth and have a great au jus.  I was sadly disappointed here.  To start, a strange mayo based dressing is applied liberally giving the, what I would assume is the most tender and juicy, roast beef a strange creamy taste and texture that is not pleasant.  The au jus is a strong french onion soup that does not go well with the sandwich. 

Overall I felt the place tries too hard to be different, too hard to be the cool place in town.  The food was a 4 (the salmon was truly excellent), the environment was a 2...I split the difference."}
{"text":"This place, the space, the staff, and the food are outstanding.   Such a great addition to the Tempe dining scene. Snagged a last-minute Saturday dinner reservation though it was crowded.  Free valet parking a huge help.  

Waiter was prompt, charming, and helpful with recommendations.  Food came quickly.  Service couldn't have been better.  

We got house salads (delicious and not ordinary), rainbow trout (perfectly cooked and amazing flavor) and green chili stew, whip, as promised by our waiter, made me want to lick the bowl.  

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This review is for a Thursday night. We couldn't even stay seated at our table inside because the live music was WAY too loud. We would've gone outside but had already waited 20 min after our reservation time for a table and our waitress (who was a perfectly nice person) said it would probably be a good wait for an outside table to open up. Outside the level of music was much more tolerable, noticeably so when we walked out. If we were in town longer we might go back on a weekday without live music to actually try the food."}
{"text":"I tried Culinary Dropout in Tempe today for the first time.  A friend recommended it. It was a good experience. First, the staff was delightful, kind and efficient. Couldn't ask for more. They were warm, but not too chatty. Kept my drink full, asked about what I was looking for and made good suggestions.

I started with a appetizer set that included capicola, cheese and something call \"cheddar pork cracklings\" which are basically like those puffy pork rinds you can get in a bag. All the apps were fine, but not amazing. For main dish, I went with the fried chicken entree. The chicken, biscuit and gravy were all excellent. I subbed my mashed potatoes for french fries with gravy (I'm from Canada, what can I say). Also excellent.  The only thing that fell a bit short was that the half breast portion of the fried chicken was dry-ish. The chicken included thigh, leg and half chicken breast. The other pieces were very good, and breast meat can sometimes be a bit dry so I wasn't  too worried. The staff was gracious and quickly offered to redo the chicken, but I relented as it was needing room for desert. For desert, I had the apple monkey bread, which was a phenomenal apple bread pudding a la mode. Great stuff.

Over all, the place is a great vibe with live music, even in the weekend afternoon. The food is very good, and the staff is absolutely awesome. I'll return to try their sandwiches which I've heard are great."}
{"text":"We hopped into the bar and had great hospitality! Our main bartender turned out to be from Maryville,TN and knew our favorite restaurant there as well as the general area. He gave great suggestions for our beer selections and Clarence tried several before ordering. We stayed just long enough to experience food envy and opted for a snack- the fresh oysters were delicious at just $3 each. The star was the hand cut chips with house made French onion dip! Delicious! Culinary Drop Out has the most draft beers inside Hard Rock, a impressive menu and along with great service you should not hesitate to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars for my first visit, if that were an option.  When 5th and Wine dared to close over Memorial weekend, my friend and fellow Yelper, Christina P, suggested CD as an alternative.

Trying to grasp onto those last few days of tolerable temps, we sat outside, and drink orders were taken promptly.  I went with the Camelback Cooler.  I wanted to love it, but it was a miss for me.  I wanted it to be a little sweeter and more \"orangey.\"  Instead, it was on the bitter side.  Cocktail number two was the Clown Punch.  This was the hit for me.  The pomegranate foam on top was unexpected, well not really since it's listed on the menu, and fun!

We all shared the soft pretzels and provolone fondue.  I could try everything on their menu, and I'm pretty sure that would still be a favorite for me.  But who doesn't love bread and cheese?  I also tried the pork belly cubano, although Christina forewarned me it's really ham, not pork belly.  Maybe that's why the restaurant is called \"Culinary Dropout.\"  Whatever the hell it was, it was really good, too.

Although the Scottsdale \"Waterfront\" is not necessarily my favorite place to be, I can see myself enjoying CD every now and then.  I can also see that 4th star with another try."}
{"text":"Well drinkers be alert!  First, we had a very nice time at Culinary Dropout, food was great!  We ordered well drinks and my husband's scotch was $2 more because he ordered it on the rocks.  Yes I know that is only $2 more but it is the principle of the matter.   It would have been nice if the waiter had let us know at the time we ordered."}
{"text":"My food, pretty good. Nice piece of rainbow trout with green beans and almonds on top. It was a tough healthy choice staring at a menu of not so healthy comfort food. The plate was unfortunately drenched with oil and butter. Anything on the menu would have been healthier. 
My not so great experience began sitting at the bar at 5:58 and was given a menu. When she came back a couple minutes later I asked for the happy hour menu, she looks at her watch and says sorry it just ended. It was 6:01. Thanks. 
I ordered the Malbec, one of five red wines by the glass. We are out of Malbec, with attitude. 
Music was way too loud, but I'll stop. I've been to culinary dropout a few times and the food is always good, but I've got other places to go for good food."}
{"text":"I organized a work event here for about 25 people and started working with Alexia on it a few months ago.  She was super accommodating to help us achieve the event we wanted by being able to customize the menu and drink options. We had a reserved area out by the bags boards with several large tables set up for us.  Two waitresses took care of the group but there were several other staff who were THE most attentive staff people I have ever experienced at a restaurant.  Filling waters, cleaning up a broken glass, clearing finished plates, and more - they really made us feel cared for!  We all really enjoyed our set menu for the evening which was two different appetizers, a choice of 4 (I think) entrees, and a few desserts.  Before and after eating, everyone had a blast playing bags and shuffle board, and just standing around mingling.  I don't know what The Yard is like for a regular pop-in dinner, but I do have to say that for an event like this we couldn't have asked for anything better.  Truly a memorable experience!  (and sadly it was SO fun I didn't even take pictures!) - Note: also posted this same review on The Yard's yelp page."}
{"text":"The name is great and the restaurant itself is awesome with a cool view of the pool. They also have these really big comfy chairs that would be fun to sit back in while watching a game and enjoying a beer. I've read some bad reviews about their staff but our waitress was really friendly so that was a plus too.

The food is where everything went downhill. We ordered pretzels with fondue cheese...which to me, was microwaved pretzel bites not cooked fully and some packaged cheese dip thrown over a candle. My wife had fried chicken which somehow got cooked in less than 5 minutes and was terrible, she barely even touched the food. The skin was soggy and gross, the meat was dry and had no flavor...worst of all it cost $22! I had a shaved prime rib dip that had a ton of fat with no flavor. I'm not sure how they justify $18 for this sandwich or the crazy prizes for anything else on their menu. 

Culinary Dropout has pretty much everything going for it besides just one thing...good food. If it weren't for our waitress, I probably would have given this place 1 star. There was just nothing good about it. We wanted to try the monkey bread so bad but I really didn't feel like throwing away another $10 here!"}
{"text":"I just got back from vacation in Scottsdale and this place was recommended to me and I have to tell you I was not disappointed.  From the time I sat down to the time I left, it truly was a great experience.  Had the Blueberry lager, which was great.  Had the pretzel nuggets and provolone fondue, which I have to tell you, YOU MUST TRY IT.  I know its just pretzels and fondue but everything is made on premise so its extremely fresh.  I had the short ribs with orecchiette pasta and I am telling you, I wish I had the receipe because I have never tasted anything like it.  I am still craving it and its been almost two weeks I am back home.  I finished with the salted caramel custard, and I was again not disappointed.  I had to share dessert as I was extremely full.  The dessert was topped with freshly popped caramel popcorn.  It doesn't get better than this.  I also had the dirty schoolgirl martini's and they were very good as well.  Staff was great and I truly recommend this place.  Now only if I can get that short rib recipe I would be so happy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Relaxing dark atmosphere with great service. Friendly Bartenders make fresh drinks different from what u typically find. Good upbeat music also. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here probably a dozen times and have always had a good time but there needs to be clearer signage that tells people you can't bring any food or drink from Barrio Cafe or other places in the Yard into Culinary Dropout. We were sitting at CD at a table of 7 for 4+ hours ordering food and drink and 2 of our party went to Barrio for food not realizing it was totally separate and were scolded repeatedly by CD staff. I won't pretend to understand the dynamics of how each business at the Yard works, but I can say as a regular customer that whatever separations there are are unclear to people walking around and after spending several hours racking up a tab at CD that it seems like nickel and diming and totally poor form to pass that angst onto customers. Figure out a better way than telling customers \"it's a health code violation\" guys, it's totally bush league customer service, especially when the whole concept of the scene is the communal element."}
{"text":"Great bar staff, super nice and quick. Food was killer. Thai chicken wings and The pub burger were ridiculously good! I am a fan. Plus bags on the patio and ping pong what more could you ask for... Oh football... Yes showing the game too! Ahhhh winner winner Thai chicken dinner"}
{"text":"Not sure how long the establishment has been in existence and I realize its in a college town but they definitely need to get their act together when it comes to service!  We had a group of 12 (with a reservation) and were seated fairly swiftly upon arrival.  But from then on it was all downhill.  Must have had at least 7 different waitstaff working our table and each meal that arrived needed to be sorted out.  Wasn't as much of a challenge as you might expect because the meals came at 3 different intervals.  As for drinks that was worse.  The first round only took 15-20 minuts, a second round ordered by a few took the same and one of our party never did receive his.

The food was creative and tasty, will grant them that.

While they may be \"Culinary droput's\" they seem to be able to know how to make a $ as the place was packed."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous service. We tried to make reservations for a party of 12 two days in advance and they refused. We tried to call ahead to get on a wait list the night of and they refused. So we ended up waiting for over two hours for a table, several people in our party left to eat elsewhere and meet up with us after they were done and they still came back before we had gotten our food. 90% of the people at our table that did order food received it cold.  I ordered a straight whiskey which it took thirty minutes to receive, even though everyone else in the party that ordered mixed drinks received them in a few minutes. It is also impossible to identify who the servers and cocktail waitresses are as they carry purses and wear regular clothes so it took us twenty minutes to flag down a waitress while waiting in the bar area because she didn't come and take orders from our table and we had no idea who worked there.

Poorly run, and the food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Our experience at the restaurant tonight was exceptional.   Jenny was the best server we have had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere & food was incredible. If you like fish, try the roasted salmon. I wish I snapped a pic, but was I was so ready to get it in my belly!!! Service was also excellent!!!"}
{"text":"After a 40 min. wait to get in on a Saturday (standard), we had to wait another 40 minutes to get our food, which wasn't expected or appreciated.  I ordered the Pork Belly Cubano and it was missing the all important pork belly.  After the wait I just ate it and left with a feeling of \"I'll never eat there again\".  The server and another helper had apprehension when the food was delivered.  Sort of \"I hope he doesn't notice it doesn't have Pork Belly!\".  The server even comically asked if it was our first trip to C.D..  Possibly a probing question into weather or not I knew I had just been screwed.  The sandwich was cold and had a Subway quality cold lunch meat.  To add insult to injury I got a plate full of dirty scrap fries.  My wife's Chicken Hash with black truffles was also kind of a joke.  You can get a better hash at the Cheesecake factory without the pretense.

All in all Culinary Dropout lives up to it's name.  We didn't write a review on our first trip to but it was forgettable and this second trip just leaves me feeling ashamed of myself."}
{"text":"Food was amazing my tuna salad was the best! Nachos were super good and the Drinks were refreshing my favorite was the smashed irishmen..."}
{"text":"We go here all the time, the service is always awesome. Sometimes the bar gets a little busy but waitresses and waiters are always prompt. Food comes out in decent time and is always consistently good. The whole vibe is really relaxed and casual. However the food is far from casual, it's definitely amazing. Perfect place."}
{"text":"Been two times to this outdoor oasis on 7th. Great beer selection and a really REALLY cool covered patio area with music and games. Fun place."}
{"text":"MY NEW FAV PLACE!!!!! 

I cannot be more excited to write this review because everything about the Culinary Dropout was a successful bliss. I love the concept of this place-big, open space, high ceiling, warehouse with cool lighting and hipster servers left and right providing excellent service. 

If the ambience wasn't cool enough, just sit down and order something on the menu. My coworker got the meatloaf and he was swimming in it. I ordered the Steak and Potatoes and was drowning in it. Definitely going back with my hubby to try all of their yummy cocktails and other dishes for sure. Probably this weekend! lol

This place would be a great place to rent for company events or even weddings and parties! If the chef was a culinary dropout, thank goodness he dropped out to create The Culinary Dropout."}
{"text":"Beer and games? This is a recipe for success! I loved this place so much that I came twice during my short visit to Phoenix. Culinary Dropout is a spacious beer hall that offers a ton of seating as well as delicious food. They have a wide selection of seating from large booths to single tables. 

The food selection is your typical bar items but the sandwiches were absolutely amazing. For food my group went with the nachos for the shareable appetizer and I chose the French Dip for the main. I must say both were very delicious! The nachos had delicious fatty pork belly all over with a type of queso as the cheese. Each bite tasted very unhealthy but it was to good to care or stop. The highlight of the meal however was the French Dip. This is probably one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The slices of meat and cheese when dipped into the savory dip turned the sandwich into a delicious delight straight from heaven. Each bite melts in your mouth and keeps you wanting more. I crushed the sandwich in a matter of minutes.

Culinary Dropout also has an outside area where you can play games. It is a very large space with several stations set up with games.

Overall, I had a great time here. The delicious food, great service, and fun atmosphere will definitely have me coming back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"This is a solid happy hour where I take friends before dropping them off at the airport. This most recent visit, I had Thai Chile Wings, Salmon Bruschetta, their Antipasti (marcona almonds, cheese, raisins, pickled peppers, prosciutto, and garlic balsamic bread), S'mores Pudding with graham crackers, and everything was delicious. Their service was slightly lacking, but I forgive them. 'Til next time, Culinary Dropout."}
{"text":"This place is gives a very hipster vibe-reminds me of home (Seattle).  There are like 3 restaurants under one building-Culinary Dropout, Little Cleo's and Barrio Urbano. 

Came here for dinner after landing in Phoenix. There was like a 15 minute wait for a table, so we walked around the Yard. The Yard is an outdoor courtyard, which connects the 3 restaurants. There is outdoor seating, TVs, and games, like ping pong tables and bean bag toss.  

We ordered Thai Chile wings as an appetizer and I ordered the Gorgonzola chicken salad. I really liked the wings, it was flavorful and the sauce had a kick to it. The salad was good as well, the only complaint I had was that there was too much dressing in it, and I usually like salad with lots of dressing, but this was like drenched in dressing. Service was ok. I would come back here next time I'm in Phoenix.

Parking here is valet only because there is 3 restaurants plus the yard under 1 roof, and their parking lot is kind of small. Our car was like literally 15 feet from the valet stand. But I guess since the parking lot is small, they would rather have valet service versus people double parking or parking illegal."}
{"text":"SO LAID BACK!!

Came here w/ some friends to grab a quick HAPPY HOUR drink & some munchies. We were  promptly greeted by a sweet girl up front then seated right away. The place was pretty empty but we got a nice window seating as the patio was way too hot for our likings... but the patio looked spacious & gorgeously open viewing the pool area. The decor of the place was fun casual w/ nice half booths & tables. They also had a little stage area as well which I assume for live performances.

Our server Trevor was very laid back & informed us on the menu. We jumped right in & ordered a couple of beers off happy hour & some bites.

TAP NO. 9 HH $3 - this beer wasbour replacement for the APRICOT heff... as they ran out =[ but it was light & crisp. The mug size was PERFECT for me as I was able to actually finish a glass since it was smaller... but for those of you who drink way more than I can... it may be a bit small.

GUINNESS HH $3 - perfectly poured GUINNESS always tastes the best w/ it's creaminess that I have no idea where it comes from when it is such a dark beer you would expect bitter bitterness.

HH PRETZEL & FONDUE $6 - this thing is freaken HUGE! I understand it is just dough... it was still big... LOVED it though... comes out w/ a little candle thing to keep the cheese fondue WARM for every pretzel piece you dip in there.

HH HAND CUT FRENCH FRIES $3 - fresh cut fries that taste like home cooked ones... obviously... cuz they are hand cut ahahaha 

HH POTATO CHIPS & ONION DIP $3 - ummm the freaken DIP is AMAZEBALLS!! simple dish but so addictive that it was the first thing to disappear instantly.

Definitely wanna come back to try their other stuff."}
{"text":"Really good food.  It is a fun menu. FeliCa the bartender was awesome. very helpful and friendly.   Beef dip was awesome. So were pretzels.  Almost made up for horrible meal at pink taco the night before.  Hard rock has a winner with this one.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Update, almost immediately after posting my review, I was contacted by the staff and given an opportunity to share my exact experience. I'm impressed and appreciative of this level of customer service. While I'm currently not planning to revisit this establishment any time soon, I'm increasing my first review. 


The staff was rude, their policies are asinine. I refuse to ever patronize this group of restaurants again. Thanks for a terrible experience last night."}
{"text":"This was my absolute favorite spot in Hard Rock and I would go back just to eat here again.  

CD has a great eclectic laid back vibe. The wide open seating area has an open prepartion area at the front, tons of tables inside, a bar towards the patio and a large open patio next to one of the HR pools.  It is very airy and open.  We sat both on the patio and once just inside facing the pool, both was great.  

We tried several dishes from the awesome pretzels and provolone fondue, to the prime rib sandwich to the black bottom pie.  It was all out of this world.  

Service was attentive.  Atmosphere is laid back and the food is wonderful.  Definitely a  must if looking for a place to eat in the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Always good food and excellent service. The pretzels are yummy and I had the grilled cheese this last time around which was great. Sit out on the patio and watch the passersby."}
{"text":"I had dinner on Saturday 5/11/13. We arrived at few min before  8pm. Half our party of nine had a drink at the bar while we waited for everyone to arrive. They seated us promptly at 8 at a great table outside by the fire pits. Great table, great  service, good food at a fair price. The pretzel nuggets and fresh oysters were spot on. Highly recomend if your in the Hard Rock Hotel."}
{"text":"Just OK dining option in the Hard Rock.  The appetizers were better than the entrees.  Kettle chips were great, the cheese crostini a standout, but the mussels were bitter and fishy tasting.

The meatloaf had good flavor but was dense and dry, mashed taters and green beans were standard, and the entire dish was only lukewarm.  Fish and chips was extremely oily, and fries were well seasoned but limp.

Service was cheerful and efficient, music was very good although quite loud right by the stage."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale is one of Sam Fox's restaurants (the guy is behind such gems as True Food Kitchen), and it's always packed on weekend nights.

When I went there for dinner on a weeknight, it was also super-busy, and at 8 p.m., our party for three had to wait a half-hour for a table. Not bad for a restaurant these days-glad to see some are still thriving.

The place is pretty gorgeous. The beautiful patio has huge comfy seating, as well as a chandelier. There's another chandelier inside, and there's a giant purple wall where the kitchen is. This used to be Pink Taco, and they really re-vamped the space to give it a whole new feel.

Seating inside is also ultra-comfortable, with plush, couch-like seating and huge armchairs. The pretty atmosphere is juxtaposed with bare bones, paper menus and a casual staff, who, luckily, get to wear whatever they want. And because this is central Scottsdale, that means the staff is attractive and hip, as is the majority of the crowd. I can see why Scottsdale socialites flock to this spot.

The menu consists of comfort food dishes, including grilled cheese sliders, burgers and fried chicken. My party started off with the delicious Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue ($10), which melted in my mouth and were so good, we had to order extra pretzels ($2). It was rich and very satisfying.

For my entree, I had Ricotta Gnocchi with mushrooms ($14)-I opted to leave the sausage off. I was really disappointed with this. While I loved the fresh cheese grated on top, the gnocchi was drenched in this heavy broth that almost melted the gnocchi. It also wasn't a very tasty sauce. I guess I should have just asked for a thicker sauce, because I almost felt like I was eating soup.

The dessert more than made up for the entree, though. We had Apple Monkey Bread ($8), a concoction of warm and gooey, cinnamon-y bread drenched in a caramel sauce and served with ice cream. It was amazing and worth the trip to the restaurant alone.

While I loved some of the food, Culinary Dropout definitely had a \"beautiful people\" vibe that might put some people off. The service was decent for being that type of place, though, and if you plan on going, make a reservation, since I'm sure this spot is going to stay busy for awhile."}
{"text":"Came here with a good friend.  We had the Korean Style Ribeye Cap and Meatloaf.  The Ribeye was exquisite.  Perfectly cooked over medium, as I requested, and seasoned.  The Meatloaf was very good.  I haven't tasted meatloaf that good in who knows how long.  We were both in Heaven. 

I had the Red Sangria to go with dinner.  It was decent.  I make a much better one at home.

Atmosphere is nice.  Will come again."}
{"text":"The best method meal I've had in awhile. Try the Sweet Corn Cannelloni. Our knowledgeable and friendly waitress recommended it. Beyond happy with the whole experience!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere, and EXCELLENT service by Ashley (with the bangs). What a difference AMAZING service makes. We loved the deviled eggs, balsamic toast, meatloaf, kale salad with salmon and my son loved his kid's burger! After dinner, we played bean bag toss and just had a great time! 

Thank you, Ashley, with the bangs! :)"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout, I love you and maybe I'm just getting old but loud live music + community seating right against the stage does not make for a good Friday night dinner out. Last night we went to Culinary Dropout for dinner and it's been awhile since I've been there during their live music performances. We asked for first available because of the wait and true to my luck, the table they chose for us was the community table with seats closest to the stage. Not only could we not hear each other over the music, but the seats were so far apart, it nearly turned into a silent film dinner. Luckily another seat a little bit further away from the stage opened up so we got to move. It was still loud but the seats were closer and we only had to say \"huh?\" a couple times. Culinary Dropout still gets four stars in my book but I wish they could figure out a way to do live music without damaging the ear drums of the eaters in front or hurting the conversation of two people on a date. Or maybe warn the restaurateurs and offer them another option."}
{"text":"Another installment of the \"craft beer/craft food\" restaurant model, but I'm ok with this model.

It's a large space, which is great.  

Ordered the pretzel bites and provolone fondue.  OH. MY. GOD.  They're incredible.

Also had their fried chicken which was fantastic (though, a bit greasy.  Could have rested a little more, nbd).

And any place that serves tall cans of PBR to go with my food, is a great place to me.

Also, if you're jonesing for a snack, you can get some of their food to go and stroll about the casino with it.

Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The apps and the main courses are great. I usually get the half chicken it comes with some awesome sides. I would recommend this place to anyone. The location is also really cool."}
{"text":"I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken.
Visually, the dish looked nice and the chicken looked crispy. The biscuit was crispy and sweat and the mashed potatoes and coslaw provided a nice tangy contrast to the sweet flavors. The chicken was nice and tender coated in a crispy crust, however my only complaint is that the chicken crust did not stick on well and came off easily. Overall, a great place with a  great food  experience."}
{"text":"My favorite from the Fox Restaurant Group, and the reason (along with the W Scottsdale) I am always ok with traveling to Arizona, even in the oppressive heat.

Went there the first time with others and we (even my pretzel-hating self) loved loved loved the soft pretzels and provolone fondue as a starter.  The kitchen accidentally prepped an extra order of black mussels, and we reaped the benefits (as an aside, always be nice to your server.  Actually, just be nice to everyone).

All of the entrees were great, but standouts were the sweet corn cannelloni and the extraordinarily decadent fried chicken.  To drink -- get the Moscow Mule. Then switch to the Home-Ec Martini.  Drink with abandon.

I went back by myself once and had just as amazing a meal sitting at the bar for happy hour.  I followed the same drinking rotation, but switched things up and enjoyed a different meal (two words: Grilledcheesesliders. Withtomatoandbacon).  Total noms.

As an aside, the outdoor patio is a total scene at night.  It's pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Last weekend we took friends from Dallas, in town for spring training and sat outside. Fire pits, live music, ppl watching, cool beers, all good. We tried the 'cheese cracklings' as one of our appetizers and they were very different & good!  Meatloaf, fish n chips, a burger and the pastrami sandwich, again all good. 
So this weekend we have a good friend in from Stanford and before today's game we are headed in for (1st time) brunch! Hope it's as good! We'll see... ...such a cool concept!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place the food is awesome, the atmosphere, the service it's my go to place! The turkey pastrami is my favorite meal, I'm a purest and prefer it without the mustard and coleslaw. The pastrami is delicious and the yummy pretzel bun is always nice and fresh. I always get the pretzel balls and fondue it's so delicious and served piping hot sometimes it has a plastic cheese taste to it, but none the less still pretty good. The house salad is also delicious, the house made dressing is like ranch, but with a lot more kick and flavor not your typical dressing. The shrimp and chicken skewers are delicious as well, but a little pricey, lots of flavor and even a little spicy. They are $6 for 1 skewer and you need about 2-3 for a meal or appetizer to share so it's not very cost efficient. My waiter on our last visit was Boston and he was AHHHMAZING! I've never had bad service, but he went above and beyond for my friends and I. Very attentive and helpful with menu selections, he even helped me choose the wine I couldn't remember getting last time and got it right yummy Prosecco! This review has made me hungry, think I'll be stopping for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Culinary dropout is one of three restaurants that shares an open area in the back, \"the yard\". The atmosphere and the vibe are great. The staff was friendly and attentive. Unfortunately the menu looked phenomenal on paper but failed miserably on execution. The Korean brussel sprouts we're so over sauced the vegetables themselves were unidentifiable. The roasted broccoli was boring. Super disappointing since we wanted to try almost everything on the menu. I will say the pretzel fondue and pork belly nachos were quite good. If you're going for drinks and a fun place to hang out, this place scores high. If you want a great meal, then this isn't the place."}
{"text":"I came here on New Year's Eve day with a couple friends around 2pm. Our original plan was actually to eat at Olive & Ivy but the wait there was about 45 minutes and this place was only 20 minutes. The dining room was closed so we were seated outside, but it was a really nice day out so we didn't mind at all. I just started with a beer at the bar while waiting - they had a decent selection, I went with Lucky Buddha. Forget what the other two had but one of them ordered a bartender's recommendation and it was really good.

Our waitress was really nice and friendly, explained the menu and a couple of her favorites, and was very attentive. I started with the Italian chopped salad. At first that's all I was going to get but I added the soft pretzels and provolone fondue after because I wanted to carb up a bit before the NYE celebrations later.

The salad came with \"salami, turkey pastrami, ham, pickled vegetables, provolone, couscous, italian dressing\" (straight from the menu) and was delicious. A generous portion and full of flavor. And the pretzel bites and fondue were great. I'm not even big on pretzels but these hit the spot - warm, soft, and sweet.

My friends got the pub burger and grilled chicken pub. I'd say they enjoyed them because their plates were clean by the end of the meal.

I would highly recommend this place, great service, food, and atmosphere and not too pricey for the location and serving sizes."}
{"text":"We arrived here for a happy hour and early dinner. The place is located in a big shopping area so it's easy to find and there is plenty of parking. There are a decent number of happy hour drink and food choices. We had a beer and the cheese plate. The cheese plate seemed like a good deal but only included cheese and nothing else so we ordered some bread too which made it pricey for happy hour. All the cheeses were good except the pimento cheese which was mediocre. We next had the kale salad and that was delicious! Great even without the dressing. My husband had both the ribs and fried chicken. The ribs are cooked amazing but the sauce is a bit sweet for my taste. The fried chicken seasoning was good but the chicken was dry. I had the Chile stew which had all the right blend of ingredients with a well cooked beef. However I would say the dish was too salty. If the salt was dialed down then I would have loved it. Our waitress was top notch...super friendly and helpful...this was definitely the best part

Bottom line...great service here, mediocre food and good ambience for happy hour 

Pros
Location 
Service!!
Kale salad 
Ambience for a drink or happy hour 

Cons 
Ribs were too sweet
Fried chicken too dry 
Stew was too salty"}
{"text":"PACKED!  Fun place to go with friends - live music, awesome nachos... different.  Fantastic Thai wings... good portions, tasty drinks... yard games.  Parking's tricky, but you can tip valet through Bravo app."}
{"text":"Love love the atmosphere but it can get a little loud so if you have a larger group sit by who you wAnt to talk to. You will not be able to hear across the table. The pretzel fondue is yummy to the tummy!! And the bartender did a great job on making me surprise drinks.plus our waiter was spot on!!!!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I went here for dinner last night before a show.  There was a 30-minute wait to sit inside so we opted for patio seating.  The sun was shining on the patio so they put the shades down for us.  That fixed the sun problem but also eliminated the breeze and kept the misters away.  By the end of our meal we were pretty hot.  Our waitress was absolutely awesome.  She was really friendly and gave great suggestions.  Based off the yelp reviews we had to try the pretzel fondue and we weren't disappointed.  This was definitely the highlight of the meal.  There were a lot of things on the menu I wanted to try but I decided on the beef stroganoff.  My friend got the prime rib dip.  The stroganoff was decent but I would definitely try something else next time.  My friend enjoyed the prime rib dip but said it wasn't worth $17.  I was very impressed by the service level here.  Both hostesses and our waitress were just exceptionally friendly and really made the experience great.  I would definitely come back for more pretzels and to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"We went here with the family for Sunday brunch. It was really nice outside so sitting outside was a nice break. We ordered some appetizers (chips, pretzel  cheese dip) and everything was good. I had the muscles and they were on the small size but were still really tasty. My boyfriend had a chicken sandwich. I was kind of surprised at how thin the chicken breast was as you could barely see that there was a chicken breast on the buns. He was still a bit hungry after. The service was good and would be back but we might try another restaurant at The Yard."}
{"text":"Manu our waiter and his trainee were the best.   This place has the best environment and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Shocked the reviews aren't better for this place. Had a live band that was excellent. Wife and kids all loved their food. Had the potato chips with onion dip to start and they were great. Moved on to the ribs, fish and chips, and fried chicken. Ribs were probably the best I've had in a long time. Fried fish and chicken were crisp and tasty. Server was very attentive.  Drinks were good.  My daughter loved the place."}
{"text":"Super fun place to go.  Make sure you have a reservation on the weekend.  They have comp. valet parking.  All the food we had was awesome!  Soft pretzels and cheese are a must!  I had the the prim rib dip.  It was a huge portion I only ate 1/2.  Their fries are really yummy and the ranch is to DIE for and homemade.  Corey our waiter was really fantastic.  Really nice and attentive.  He must be the bomb because he was training someone.  There is a lot of open air seating, live music, and a game area."}
{"text":"Such a cool place! I love the tons of outside seating, and the ambiance is great. Our server was super friendly as well. With all this going for them, they don't even need to have good food, and a great drink list but they do! 

We were just doing drinks and apps, so we had the pretzel bites (huge serving) and the wings. Both were delicious. I wish I lived in AZ, I would definitely frequent this place."}
{"text":"The fried chicken was interesting. Fried very dark, almost burnt, and then covered in a honey glaze. I recommend it if you like alternative tastes to classic dishes. The pretzels were, as other described, a lot of food. Plenty for 4. Other than being Vegas hotel pricy, it was a pleasant experience. Compared to the HardRock in the parkinglot, and 24/7 next door, this is by far the better of the three."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, I've eaten here probably a dozen times by now. I had a friend who works for the same company as CDO and for her one year anniversary they gave her four complementary meal vouchers or something of that sort so she invited me and my fiance. 

I love the atmosphere of the restaurant, there's a rather spacious patio that's right next to the pool which I love sitting on. The inside is dark and it has a very quirky, hip vibe. All the servers are very knowledgable and authentic.

You absolutely NEED to get the pretzels with fondue. They are absolutely incredible. The soft pretzel nuggets are served fresh and steaming with a a sizable portion of melted cheesy goodness. The pork belly nachos were a gigantic serving, after those two apps I couldn't believe we still had an entree and a dessert each.

I ended up getting the Salmon to be on the healthier side of things. It was served with roasted cauliflower and a cauliflower puree and some cut up snap peas. The salmon was moist and cooked perfectly. I loved every single bite.

Every experience I've had at CDO has been fantastic. The service is always on point, the food is consistently delicious, they have a lot of local beers, and the decor makes it a great place to go with groups and out of towners."}
{"text":"Tasty happy hour and good drinks. Love the pretzels. I love the sangria, friendly staff. Enjoy going there before a night out for starters and drinks!"}
{"text":"The food here is OK. The staff is the worst. They are too busy talking to the other wait staff to care about giving good service. Bartenders are shaking the crap out of drinks like they are making nectar of the Gods, drinks were OK. The wait staff doesn't take away empty plates, don't ask if you want another drink, again they are too busy chatting it up with other staff and adjusting short skirts that are riding up to high into their privates (so weird/gross when they are taking your order). Won't be back. Thirsty Lion had better food."}
{"text":"I loved the snacks and appetizers! I could have eaten the chips and onion dip and pretzels and fondue all night! The Gorgonzola salad was not my favorite - it was more acidic and bitter than I expected- I think I was expecting something sweet and creamy. A lot of the snacks/ appetizers on the menu looked really good, so I'm hoping to go back and try some more."}
{"text":"I've been to both the Tempe and Scottsdale locations numerous times. I'm typically treated with spectacular service, but tonight I was astounded by the out of this world service Christian showed. I called about 7:45 asking if they were busy, Christian informed me that they were getting full, but there'd be no wait then, I told him it'd be approximately 40 minutes before I arrived and he assured me he could seat us. He asked that I request him when I showed. I arrived at 8:30 and asked to be seated. Come to find out it'd be a 30 minute wait. I asked for Christian and he immediately sat my father and I. Amazing service all around. Christian deserves a promotion."}
{"text":"The girls and I decided to try this place out after having a few drinks at the W one Friday night. We all heard great things and I think I was the only one that hadn't eaten here yet. It was crazy busy and we waited about 20 min. or so for a table, the bar was even packed so we hung outside in chairs near the front entrance. I decide to go for the burger and fries and my friend decides to go for some sort of fish dish and my other friend settled for the apple monkey bread. My burger was big but very bland and the fries were standard, I could have gone to In-n-out and saved some money. My friend's fish and veggies were undercooked and the server insisted that was one of their best dishes at the restaurant....really O_o...after sending it back one of the manager's did come out and say that the food was undercooked and took it off the bill and offered to make her something else but my friend declined. The best thing about the meal was my friend's apple monkey bread, I could have eaten tons of that stuff! 

Our server was extremely slow the entire time we were there and it took her almost 20 min. to bring our check after we requested it...we were 10 sec. away from complaining to the manager. 

First impressions are everything so I am very hesitant about trying this place out again...we shall see."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place. The service is amazing. You have a view if the pool and the prices aren't bad. I had the roast beef sandwich and it was to die for. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The service was not the finest, but I admit that there were 2 additional people that joined are party towards the end. I don't think it should have impacted the services, but the server was also apparently about to finish his shift 30 or so minutes after they arrived.

I ordered the fish and chip, which were nothing worth writing home about. A friend of mine had the ribeye cap and he mentioned that it was insanely amazing so definitely need to try next time."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a hipster restaurant, but I'm not going to lie - the pretzels and cheese were ridiculously good.  Atmosphere wasn't really my style, but the food is good enough to look past it.  They are trying to appeal to ASU community, and reasonably so."}
{"text":"Snagged a quick brunch reservation here for a birthday weekend trip. The staff was friendly enough, but informed us that we'd have a shortened time for our reservation - despite there being plenty of open tables the entire duration of our meal. The space is interesting, the food is decent enough though the staff is a little slow to respond. The pretzel fondue and the oysters were NOT popular at our table and I was a little underwhelmed by my sweet corn ravioli, but my companions liked their fried chicken and the rib eye well enough. Solid lunch option."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hard Rock and ate here both nights.  The food is fresh and just enough portions.  The staff is fun and friendly.  One of my favorites when I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect coming here but we wanted to check out the place everyone had been telling us about. Made reservations then get there and told wait would be about 15 minutes (I hate when that happens, why make reservations then) We decided we'd just sit outside so that we could be seated right away. We get seated and ordered our food when we order drinks. While waiting for our food, I saw three times where food was brought out to the wrong table and I'm thinking how is that happening. After 42 minutes, our food finally arrived (we only ordered the kids mac n cheese, fish and chips and the roasted salmon). My husband's salmon was not cooked completely. After flagging down 1 of our 2 servers, she told us \"yeah, it's normally medium. Let me get that fixed\" and took my husband's plate. The second server had come by the table a few times, only to chat with my 2.5 year old (yeah, odd). So after we sent the salmon back, she comes by again to talk to my son, never asking how things are or even noticing my husband didn't have his food. I interrupted her conversation with my little guy to let her know things were ok but my husband wasn't happy with his salmon. She goes \"oh, well they normally only cook it medium rare\". So I ask well why did the other lady say it's medium? This chick just smiled at me and then started back talking to my son. The chef ends up bringing the salmon back out and apologized and it was to my husband's liking. While we were eating, another guy comes over to us with someone else's order asking if it was ours....i just shook my head and laughed. The service was ok. The place nice and trendy, reminded me of some east coast places i loved. Probably should've sat inside, outside was sooo noisy (but, i wasn't ok waiting when I'd already made reservations) This place is probably somewhere I'd come with girlfriends for happy hour or to have drinks and appetizers before going out but not family dinner again. The first server seemed busy and the second server.....
This place is huge and I feel like with it being that big, the kitchen should be able to accommodate large crowds. There's no reason our food should have taken so long (and neither server came by with updates about the wait or to let us know it would be out soon) and I'm still trying to figure out why they kept taking food to wrong tables. We only came here because we wanted to check it out before the one in Gilbert opens."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing & fun. I walked right up to the bar for dinner staying @ the Hard Rock on my own & the guy says next to me, \"You know the food is good here when you work here & you come back on your night off.\" Haha!

I got the pretzels & cheese fondue, which was LEGENDARY. Just talking about it makes me want to go back all over again, oh my goodness. I ate the whole thing by myself, I never finish anything when I'm on my own, I always make my husband finish it lol

Then I had the fried chicken dinner dish, it was also really good. I ended up getting the s'mores pudding to go & saving it for breakfast because I'm obsessed with actual s'mores (no wannabe s'mores flavors, please) & I was so satisfied the next day! It started me off just right. 

The customer service was nice, locals that work there & are very efficient & courteous. It's a bit dim in there so don't bring your work in, just take a few hours off & enjoy the food, drinks, & people."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. Got here around 4:30pm to beat the traffic. There were many seats available inside out out so we chose out. The street was a bit noisy but not too bad. 
I got the pub burger and a berry mojito. Tasted amazing! Large portion of fries and a dill spear on the side. I thought the mojito was on the happy hour but found out later it wasn't and I paid $9.
My husband got the fish and chips. The fish had a very different seasoning on it which was very unexpected but amazing! Very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The coleslaw was the perfect amount of dry! 
The o my downsides were the noise and the prices were a little high especially for drinks even during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Staying at the hard rock hotel, went to go get some lunch before lounging by the pool. First stop, pink taco. 

Pink taco managed to, within 3 minutes, make us feel so uncomfortable we left. 

Luckily, we went next door to the culinary dropout. Where we sat at the bar and was greeted by a very nice bartender Felicia. We got the baked pretzels with melted provolone cheese-amazing. Then we kept it light with their \"cheap house salad\"-the ranch dressing was outstanding. 

Felicia and Matt were absolutely amazing, you can tell they both enjoy their jobs. You just don't really see that with bartenders/servers working on the strip. 

Needless to say, we said BYE FELICIA TO PINK TACO. 

....AND HELLO FELICIA at CULINARY DROP OUT."}
{"text":"Pretzel Fondue...meat and cheese plate and meatloaf oh my! :)  It was a nice gesture for the GM to bring down the projector screen for us during the Stanley Cup Finals... hi-five GM."}
{"text":"On Thursday the 29th I ventured in to culinary dropout after shopping. I was greeted by lovely hostess. She brought me and my friend Andrew to our table. Within moments our waitress was there to take our drink order. Her name was Brittany she had a great attitude from the start. Told me about the specials. I already decided that I wanted the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. She was on top of my drinks I never had to ask about a refill. The chicken was moist with some great flavor. She thanked us for coming in. I had a great experience and I will for sure be back to let her take great care of us again. Brittany made our experience one to not forget, her energy and effort was above and beyond."}
{"text":"It was my first time and I must say it won't be my last. Scot the manager and logan were very helpful. I had the pretzels and fondu wow !! I had the turkey pastrami and it was so moist ! The bun was delicious and the vibe is so cool. I must say weather might be hot but the people are COOL. THANKS"}
{"text":"Liked the a la carte appetizer concept. My food was good and decent craft beer selection. Server was friendly. Main negative was loud music made it difficult to converse. Pounding bass of techno music reverberated so you could literally feel it.  Asked if it could be slightly reduced but it was not possible. Seriously guys if the music was less deafening you'd still be hip and people could actually converse and enjoy the without shouting. If I had read this review I would have known to choose a different restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I came on a Friday night around 7.  Have a reservation as this place gets crowded.  We started with the pretzel fondue and I highly recommend them!  We decided to split up the meatloaf which was enough for two and was fantastic.  Tons of beer on tap and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's a damn good burger and well mixed drinks, and the service in the couch area was very good. However, we had a very bad experience ordering drinks when waiting for a table - there was a misunderstanding between which bartender was serving us that the bartender blamed us for rather than figuring out between the two of them how they should divide their bar. After that the bartender who we didn't give the order to who thought she deserved the order was extremely rude. It put a sour cast over our whole evening."}
{"text":"second stop on our booze cruise. we arrived a few minutes before the horde of other riders so we got a spot at the bar. 
we asked the bartender about the moonshine drinks and she was able to explain them (it's not like the 'shine my grandpa use to make....). we tried the blueberry, apple pie, and strawberry moonshine drinks. they were all tasty but not too sweet. 

when the other riders (about 100 of them) showed up, the place got busy. but what was so impressive was watching the 2 bartenders work that place! they were in such a flow, it was amazing how fast and smooth they worked! 

we didn't eat this time, but they have a good, albeit small food menu and the decor is as usual, very cool!"}
{"text":"Went to Culinary Dropout recently while in Phoenix during the Christmas Holidays.  Boy!  Move away for 6 years and the Tempe Town lake area just exploded.  Culinary Dropout is one of the latest \"explosions\" and this one was great.  3 of 6 of us had the green chili stew which was excellent.  Since we were sitting on the patio where it was cool at night, the warmth of the chilli hit the spot.  My wife had the mussels which she loved and another person had the ribs which were great as well.  Very nice jewel in the desert."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about my experience at Culinary Dropout. I am absolutely in love. 

The ambiance is amazing, I love the decor, the whole vibe. We were seated near the stage and to our surprise a live solo act started a few minutes later. An awesome guy on a guitar, who even took my mom's request. He was awesome.

Our server, Ben, was incredible. He was helpful from drinks, to menu, to what to do out on Fremont Street. Lets start with the pretzels and fondue....we started with one order.....and ended with three. INCREDIBLE. You HAVE to try them. I split the Maple Salmon for dinner and a split portion was perfect after enjoying appetizers. The beets on the dish were delish. We ended with the Apple Monkey Bread & the Carmel Popcorn pudding thing. It was AMAZING.

If you find yourself out at The Hardrock you HAVE to eat here. Enjoy it. Drinks, Food, Great service..........I want pretzels right nowwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Culinary Dropout on several occassions and and just now getting to write a review on them. Great location. I love how you can eat outside and play a bunch of different games after your meal. This place gets packed very quickly so be prepared for that. I have tried a few things on the menu but by far the best thing I've tried has been the pretzel bites with the white cheddar fondue! I can put that fondue on anything and eat it. If you come on happy hour, the price of this dish is discounted and is still a huge portion. Happy hour is the time to go to this spot. Good drink specials and food is pretty good too. I have had their pork belly nachos before and those were also really good. Overall a nice place to come for a happy hour and yard games."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't hate the Hard Rock so much because I love Culinary Dropout.  LOVE IT.  They have a TURKEY PASTRAMI SANDWICH.  Yes folks, you read that right - a turkey pastrami sandwich and it's to die for.  You know how all the buzz in the sandwich world right now is the pretzel bun?  And it seems like an awesome concept until you find yourself gnawing on a dry, dense piece of dull bread with a shiny pretzel finish?  Well, Culinary Dropout actually succeeds with the pretzel bun.  I love that bun so much I just might marry it.  I'm sick of being single anyway.  

There's also a lovely slaw that drips from the sandwich that I found so tasty, I began scooping up the drippings with my fries.  

I also tried their roasted beets (SO GOOD) and their deviled eggs.  Culinary Dropout has managed the impossible - they've made deviled eggs sexy.  

Their only downfall is their location - ugh, the Hard Rock.  So many drunk twentysomethings in bedazzled t-shirts!  I will look past them though, for another chance to eat that sandwich though.  Those are powerful words, my friends.  Powerful words indeed.  Almost as powerful as \"pretzel bun\" ammIright?"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, service is average. I had drink with ginger beer in it (name escapes me) but it was excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Such an upbeat atmosphere. Not too pricey and it's right by fashion square so you can do some shopping after !"}
{"text":"Loud, and youthful, but quite nice preparations and service.  We would definitely go back.  In particular, we recommend the Korean style Brussels, and the beets.  The fries are pretty good, too!"}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated right away.  The Decor of the restaurant was great.  Very cool.  The waiter was very attentive and gave great recommendations from the menu.  Our table had the beef stroganoff, ribs and the fried chicken.  We all were very pleased with our meals.  We would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Another example of how Fox Concept has done it right. The food is delicious! Our sever was amazing! He knew to check in often enough, but not too much. He could talk from experience about menu items and really knew the pairings. Excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Go before 6 and their happy hour is incredible! Get the red sangria and its around $4 a glass  my favorite plate is their fried chicken and their perogies garnished with Brussel sprouts as a starter."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and the reviews were accurate.  The food was very good and the service excellent.  I went there two nights in a row.  First night alone and had the trout, it was great.  My waiter, Joey, was great.  He was helpful in suggesting choices of food and beer, plus he was really nice and made my night a great experience. So much so I went back the next night with a coworker to try the Korean steak.  It was great and our waitress, Jackie, was awesome as well.  She made it another great experience.  Great place"}
{"text":"This really is as good as it gets. From bottom to top it's a great location, great vibe, great selections on food and cocktails. Our server was Alan, he had a fancy mustache, and made good suggestions.  My picky toddler ate almost all her food, plus some breadsticks. I loved my fried chicken with perfect biscuit. Everyone was happy, we had a good time, and used the vallet. (parking is a beast) Eat here, be happy here."}
{"text":"I really like the vibrant professional atmosphere this place has. Fun, open, staff is friendly. Apps were amazing and the drink selection was great.

I'm only giving 4 stars for two reasons. 1. The bar is SLOW.. should not be the case at a place that stays this packed. 2. Most of the food is beyond hot with spice.  My tacos were so hot I couldn't eat them. Nothing on the menu warned you about that.

Overall, I loved it, but will approach the menu with more caution next time."}
{"text":"Whoever designed this restaurant did an excellent job.  I guess Scottsdale's restaurants are all about replicating the \"club scene.\"  The \"club\" ambiance can easily make a restaurant tacky, but I felt this place was classy/edgy.  

We had our baby with us and it was his dinner time as well.  We asked the waitress if they had a microwave to heat up his Gerber food, and she said they don't have one.  Guess they make everything fresh.  Instead, she said that one of the chefs offered to put his food into a bowl and heat it in the oven.  Fantastic!

As for the food, we ordered the honey fried chicken and shaved prime rib sandwich.  Sandwich was on the salty side, but I enjoyed my fried chicken."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my mom here for dinner on Thursday night. We started off with the suggested Pretzel/Fondue app. My mom wanted to try the bread and oil as well. HOLY CARBS. It was amazing tho. I was pretty full before dinner even came.
 Not a huge menu, so My mom ordered the shrimp salad-grilled, not fried like it comes, I ordered the Chicken Salad and my husband ordered the Italian Salad ( I think it was called that) 
The pretzel app was amazing. The fondue tasted so amazing I could eat it every day haha. The oil for the bread had a sweet balsamic at the bottom and it was amazing, one of the best Ive had. 
The salads were awesome. My husband said the best salad hes had in a long time. My mom and I liked ours as well.
Husband also got a purple haze, which is a beer he said he has only seen in Denver, so he was happy about that. 
We sat on the patio (even tvs with the game on it) and the heaters were on, man we live in AZ. for sure.
We had a great time. I would def. suggest it. The only thing I didnt love was the music was super loud at times, then would get quieter, then super loud, so it was hard to talk, even outside, but I will still be back. Great Place."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place...cute name and theme.  Plus, I looked at their menu online and was pretty excited.  

What's funny is that OTHER than the food (somewhat of a big deal when I go out to eat and I'm starving!) I had a great experience here.  Service was great (really great actually), we got right in and I had one of the best gin cocktails I've had in awhile.  Delish...if anything go for a few drinks and move on somewhere else for the food.

I had trout and it was worse than something I could make at home on a Tuesday night.  Which is saying a lot b/c I'm a terrible cook.  Sides were flat, small portion and just not very satisfying.

Conclusion  - great service, great drinks and fun atmosphere but terrible food.  Lots of other great places like that in Scottsdale, don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday around 11:00am. They had all the football games going very very loud so it was hard to hold a conversation. I can handle the above mentioned items however the food was terrible. Hamburgers were not cooked as requested they took forever to serve us and there were only maybe 6 other people in the restaurant. Don't waste your money going there"}
{"text":"I have previously been to this location on a casual day, was not that impressed at the time. However when I went back and took my children as it seemed more like a kickback family type vibe, I was much more impressed. The staff was above par, and probably my favorite part of the establishment. From the hostesses in the front, to the waitstaff bussers and management, they were all amazingly friendly and accommodating. Whenever someone has been a server or hostess in the past, I think we critique other waitstaff that much more, but also are understanding of issues. That being said, everyone was so welcoming and it made the experience very fun and easy for my children and myself. Some of the menu can use some tweaking, but it's affordable, diverse, and appropriate for the crowd. I will be back. Super chill and great for adults and kiddos. To note, I don't think this place would be appropriate for those people reviewing this who intend to allow their children to run crazy and unsupervised. This is largely an adult establishment, and a few older children if properly supervised, would not be an issue, mine are 11 and 13."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  Great vibe and excellent food - and we didn't get past aps (Pretzels and Fondue) and dessert (Monkey Bread).  Both were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout has created a very unique experience with beautiful interior layout expansive ceilings in-game area.

Unfortunately the quality of their food and service is very sub average. Most of their dishes tend to be loaded with high amounts of oil and fat which shows the attention has been taken away from health and high-quality ingredients.

I would give this a 4 or 5 because the environment and Vibe is extremely fun and well suited for families after-work outings or even dates."}
{"text":": Okay, okay.  I don't know if I would have gone here if someone hadn't had a coupon.  Haven't been entirely impressed w/ Fox Restaurant Concepts in the past, but decided to try it out after seeing the roadside transformation during our frequent drives home, along 7th Street.  

Parking situation is ridiculous.  Blocking off the medium size lot to valet only clientele is annoying, considering The Yard (the covered bar area mostly belonging to Culinary Depot) is looking to be lined w/ several more businesses, including a coffee shop/bakery.  

Gave up my cell number at the hostess station and informed of a 25 minute wait, which wasn't too bad for a new, buzzed about Phoenix location.  By the time they texted (an impressive 10 minutes quicker than estimated) we'd already found a place at one of the bar tables out back and been served drinks by a polite waitress.

Sipped adequately potent 10$ drinks as we waited for our third and received no attitude for excessive lounging.  Crowd ranged from upper class urban to downtown hipsters, all ages, including kids, but the latter disappeared after dark, replaced by scantily clad ladies and their young gentlemen friends. 

Food was unimpressive, considering they're touting themselves as a gastropub (Meatloaf: Terribly ketchupy, Grilled Cheese: A bit crusty, Cannelloni: Inhaled, assumed okay.) but all in all the ambiance was all right.  Wouldn't necessarily return for dinner, but might hang out having a few drinks w/ friends on a lazy Sunday evening.  

Bar section is open and wheelchair friendly, free of steps."}
{"text":"Good wine and beer selection and I appreciated how the kitchen was open late. The French Dip sandwich and au jus was the best I've had (after the first bite I couldn't put the sandwich down to take a picture) The fries were perfectly cooked and seasoned also!"}
{"text":"What a find!  Make your own charcuterie platter and don't miss the Brussel sprouts!  The meat quality was excellent only surpassed by the Korean-spiced sprouts!  The pasta was tender with a delicate browned butter sauce accompanied by delicately cut roasted veggies. 
Will definitely be on my must visit list for Tempe!  Cool structure as well!"}
{"text":"Some places are all hype and Culinary Dropout is a perfect example.

Looking for overpriced, small portioned and low quality food? You got it at CD. 
For $20 you can get a slide of meatloaf, instant mashed potatoes and green beans. $15 for grilled cheese and tomato soup the food here is just meh.

The restaurant itself is pretty nice and alot bigger than it looks. Its nice to have indoor and door seating and a place like this. The beers we ordered from the bar came wrapped in brown paper bags which is a cool touch. Service was pretty lacking during our experience. Having to wave down our careless waiter for refills got old real quick. The restaurant itself its pretty nice, good ambiance and decor but none of this makes up for the subpar food and service."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is without a doubt one of the coolest vibes in Tempe whether you're looking for a quick lunch bite during the week or a larger group outing in the evening. I love the decor, the service, the menu breadth, and the prices; but when it comes down to the food I think they fall into the 'jack of all trades master of none trap'. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Again with this much real estate it's near impossible to trump the atmosphere at Culinary Dropout, and the responsive staff keep up with what can be some serious lunch time volumes. Our party of five was tended to wonderfully and the food came out quick once ordered even during a mobbed Friday lunch hour. Star. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

$13.00 for a medium to large sized sandwich is a bit steep in Tempe, but it wasn't unreasonable given what were some solid ingredients and a generous portion of fries. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

I had sky high expectations for my Turkey Pastrami sandwich, I mean, they went so far as to star is on the menu! Maybe it was these expectations that robbed the sandwich of a home run, but I simply didn't think that this was a dish that I couldn't pretty easily replicate after a quick visit to the grocery store.

I was expecting fresh juicy house made turkey pastrami, but whether or not that was the case, it came across as just the standard Boar's Head Cracked Pepper Turkey that you can find anywhere. From there, the pretzel bun didn't impress as much as I thought it would, the the slaw was standard. A good sandwich no doubt, but not a gamechanger in my view. Single Star. 

Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?

I like Culinary Dropout, but I'm not sure I could find a dish on the broad menu that couldn't be trumped elsewhere in town. No Star."}

To top it off, they made me a latte at 7PM."}
{"text":"Huge venue. Great beer. Great service. Awesome ping pong and corn hole.  Very trendy joint with a bunch of beautiful hipsters.  Their grub was on point.  I'd definitely would make this my must visit when I return to PHX."}
{"text":"I usually order one prairie breeze cheddar and one order of balsamic bread to-go when I come here and it's delicious. However, they give you such a small portion of cheese (which is fine, I understand it's nice Cheese). So keeping this in mind, last time I decided to *splurge* and  ordered TWO prairie breeze cheddars (which totals to $8 for JUST CHEESE). Lol what came in my to-go box was literally two TINY broken up pieces of cheese that did not even amount to how much someone gets for ONE order of cheese. I'm very disappointed that I was fine with paying extra for another cheese, but you guys still jipped me. I might as well have gotten only one Cheese, I wonder what you would have put in there if I did. One tiny little crumb of cheese for $4 perhaps? Not ordering from your location ever again."}
{"text":"3 stars with the potential for more if they add happy hour deals that include their cocktails because their mixologist deserves an Emmy or whatever the equivalent is for drink inventors!! 

Specifically, the Last Word, which includes Hendricks Gin, Green Chartreuse and lime juice garnished with cucumber and cherries and the Ginger Margarita that wreaks of ginger with Milagro Silver, lime, Cointreau and ginger agave syrup. 

Service was good and patio seating is comfortable.

The menu items sound so creative. A genius composed the copy for the menu. Everything sounds so delicious. And, the food is good but it falls a little short of the expectations set by the titles. Don't get me wrong. I'll totally be back. 

Here's what I've tried so far: 

I've had the soft pretzels & provolone fondue a couple times now and they're tasty but there's more cheese than pretzels... not exactly a problem if you order something that comes with fries and you're a dipper, though! 

The pork belly cubano title is misleading but the description sets it straight: \"tavern ham.\" It's not pork belly. It's still yummy. Think awesome ham sandwich with cole slaw on top. And, it may be even better the next day! (The sandwiches are giant - I had to bring half home) This may be my favorite menu item so far. 

The shaved prime rib dip is served with fontina cheese and a side of the onion soup for dipping. Personally, I prefer au jus and I probably wouldn't order the onion soup on its own... it was very sweet! :( 

The butternut squash cannelloni is good but it ain't cannelloni. It's rectangular ravioli. Four of them. Again, plenty of food. Good flavor. Would've preferred more brussel sprout \"leaves.\" 

I tasted my dining companion's short rib pasta and the pasta was over cooked. Might be worth trying again. Seemed like a hearty dish. 

Finally, finished up with the monkey bread. It reminded me of refrigerator biscuit dough topped with cinnamon bun frosting, apples and cinnamon. The ice cream flat out sucked like generic grocery store ice cream. 

I think, in the future, I'll chose a cocktail for dessert! Seriously! They're really creative and delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing staff, never had a bad meal can't wait to revisit this place it's just fun and awesome!"}
{"text":"Dropped in at Culinary Dropout for early dinner and  in time for happy hour. The happy hour small plates are tasty. Dinner was okay but need more non red meat choices. Dinner entrees are a little over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"I had my eye on the new Culinary Dropout location ever since I knew it was opening in The Yard... I love love love the entire concept and the venue space... There is a lot of parking and there is even complimentary valet... We went on a Tuesday evening and were able to get a table upon walking in... The hostess was extremely nice and friendly... She asked us if we had been to the/a Culinary Dropout and we said they we had been to the one in Scottsdale... Our server Chris was very attentive and great with recommendations... The Fried Chicken was really good and it didn't take as long as I thought it would... It also came with mashed potatoes and a veggie that I can't remember, but it was super filling and yummy... I had a moscow mule and although the pricing was a little steep for a small \"clear\" glass, it was made to perfection... I agree with other people and I think that $10 for a pretty small, \"not copper\" glass is a bit much, so hopefully something changes there, but I did enjoy the drink and can't wait to try the other mixes. As full as I was at the end of my meal, I wanted to try one of the desserts (they all sound amazing) and so we went with the Bourbon Black Bottom Pie. The pie was super good and completed the entire meal, I had to roll out of the joint... On our way out, we walked through the \"play area\" where there is cornhole and ping pong... I like the couch areas with the little fire places, great for \"cold\" nights... I can't wait for the summer to roll around because you know that area will be crazy busy, but crazy fun... Oh and there is an outside-ish bar on the North side which has Happy Hour, all the time..."}
{"text":"AWESOME! a must try when in Vegas!

Try the Wild Berry Blueberry Beer, and the pretzels as an appetizer!! AWESOME combination. The servers were extremely nice and helpful, very talkative with the customers. Very delicious and amazingly tasty food! Will return when I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great prime rib dip sandwich and the Margaritas rock"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is a fantastic place to eat! The interior is very rocker complete with  stage for bands, interesting and yummy food, with an array of beers  and amazing food! If you decide to go (which I don't know why you wouldn't ) try their monkey bread for dessert, it is to die for!"}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.

Culinary Dropout is the type of place I'd love to have in Summerlin.  Great HH portions and about 10 beers for $4 (all drafts) from 3-6pm.  I had the salmon brushetta to begin.  Great portion size.  The dish came with 3 large pieces of toast, smothered in great tasting salmon and a few anchovies.  I also ordered a kale and brussel sprouts salad with some added salmon to keep the fish theme alive.  This was a remarkable salad.  Large portion, fresh veggies, and even peeled sprout leaves, very unusual for a salad topping and more seen as a side dish.  I loved it in the salad nonetheless.  I couldn't finish it all so lunch will be tasty as a leftover.  The total cost of this was $30 after tax.  Not cheap but also similar to a downtown Summerlin or high end pub anywhere else in the country.  I really enjoyed the restaurant's food and overall menu and would surely recommend it as an event space, a HH destination, or even to listen to live music."}
{"text":"My husband & I came here on our trip, the pretzel fondue was delicious.  The jambalaya we ordered was fantastic.  I really like their cheap salad with the tomato vinegrette, although it was extremely small. We also had the Bourbon Pie it was yummy but make sure you scoop all the way down to get yummy goodness of rich chocolate."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the music, the service, and the food. the crowds didn't bother me and the music was nice too."}
{"text":"This place was overall really good. Menu a bit limited, but great service and atmosphere. We all enjoyed our entrees, apps and drinks, would definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this place. The pretzel rolls are outstanding and I usually order the meatloaf for a main course. A great place to take folks from out of town. Solid service and a high energy atmosphere make this a favorite."}
{"text":"Went here one night after work mid-week and had a great time.  Very fun and friendly vibe and good service.  The salmon was perfection.  The pasta one of my friends ordered was devoured.  The pretzel bites we started with were ridiculous.  A great time was had by all.  They have their act together."}
{"text":"Not really impressed. The food was expensive and not that great. The service was really good but the atmosphere is more of a 'yard\" that happens to have a restaurant there. Doubt that I will go again."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. I had my friends bring me back some for lunch one day and I fell in love. So I dragged my husband to it a couple months later. The live music was awesome. The food was great. And even tho we were 15 minutes late to our reservation, they still sat us pretty quickly! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I arrived around 5 and headed to the bar. It was already starting to get packed so I was lucky to grab a seat. The bartender was attentive despite being swamped, which I really appreciated. I ordered some variant of a mule, which was very tasty. 

After the rest of my party arrived we were quickly sat. Our server was highly attentive the whole night. We never had an empty glass or plate for long. We had the bbq pork nachos and pretzel roll fondue. The fondue was great, who doesn't love melted cheese? And the pretzel rolls were surprisingly not dry and delicious. The nachos used real cheese but were already cold by the time they arrived to our table.

I ordered the ribs and they were decent. The meat was cooked well, not fall off the bone but very tender, but the sauce was a little overpowering. 

Overall a good experience for a trendy night out."}
{"text":"Visited on a Wednesday afternoon to the 7th Street address.  Nice atmosphere for sitting outside and having a drink - it is a huge open space.  I ordered the Kale salad - it listed a number of ingredients which the salad did include, but they were incredibly sparse.  The roasted cauliflower was microscopic and I only found about three itty bitty pieces - about 1/4 teaspoon, same with some of the other toppings.  For $13 I would think it could be more generous, I left hungry and feeling a little ripped off, although what little salad I got was still good. The service was fine - I noticed a lot of reviewers complaining about that, but then I went during a slow time."}
{"text":"Really good. Great if overly-trained earnest service.

I've been here a few times. Nice atmosphere although this is poisoned somewhat by TVs EVERYWHERE. This American phenomenon of placing TVs all over the place is really horrible. Can't seem to escape it.

Besides the Big Brother view-screens this is a great place with good food. Recommended."}
{"text":"I tried 3 drinks here.  Their Mojito was good, but not outstanding.  It had blueberries in it.  The Smashed Irishman was fantastic - frothy, lemony, well-balanced and smooth.  According to the bartender, it's their most popular so far.  I also had the Bacon-Infused Bloody Mary.  This is a bloody mary mixed with bacon-infused Absolut with a sliced of cooked bacon used as a garnish.  While it was intriguing, I'm glad I had it last because it was overloaded with flavor (spicy, smoky, salty, tomatoy) and quite filling.

For food, I ordered the crusty bread with olive oil and 12-hour roasted tomatoes, which I combined to make open-faced sandwiches.  So that's about $5 for the food and about $30 for the drinks.

The cocktails are expensive, but you get what you pay for.  I'd try just about any of the ones I saw on the list."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my visit last night. I have been to the Scottsdale location and had delicious food and good service. My time spent at the Temp location did not live up to this. First, we asked the host to be sat near a heater outside, and he took us to the farthest coldest table that was very dark. We then decided to sit in the open seating next to the bar. We sat down and waited 20 minutes without anyone coming to serve us. I went to the bar to ask for a server and it took another 15 minutes to get water. By this time we had been there for 45 minutes. We finally ordered drinks which were not the drinks we ordered. Had asked for draft beers and got bottled. We ordered food, both of my friends food was good but my tomato soup was cold. It was also my friends birthday and they brought out his cake when he wasn't there and it was very uncomfortable and awkward. I feel so bad that we got such bad service on his birthday, I am so sad this location did not live up to my expectations because the staff was so inattentive, I really felt like I was bothering the restaurant staff by being there."}
{"text":"Pork belly nachos were superb! The cibatta bread was the delicious! But it was the turkey pastrami sandwich that stole the show! Decently priced too, my party of three ate more than enough food for only 35 bucks,  can't beat that!!"}
{"text":"Had a nice relaxing happy hour with my best friend, server was very helpful in seating us, and waitress who served our table was quick and attentive.  Enjoyed my meatloaf sandwich, house chips, and sangria!  We will be back next time."}
{"text":"This has been a regular place for lunch for a number of friends for several years now. We were there yesterday for lunch and were blasted by the volume of the music, both in the main area and in the open area where we were seated. We found ourselves actually yelling to have a conversation. And in case you thought it was just us, the 20 somethings seated next to us were equally frustrated. 

We asked our server if she could see if the music could be toned down just a bit. She said she agreed, that she couldn't even hear her customers order. She came back, apologized and informed us that the manager said it couldn't be turned down!  

 So Culinary Dropout, you've lost us as customers. It is a shame, the food is good and the service has always been great, but I am not about to drive 12 miles to have lunch in a place where the management could care less about the comfort of their guests."}
{"text":"First time here. So good! I'll be checking out the one by me in Vegas soon. Seared tuna salad was great and service was excellent."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this location , seating is perfect with a great view of downtown scottsdale the sangria is to die for and the smoked salmon bruschetta during happy hour is a must , I try to make it to their happy hour at least once a week ."}
{"text":"Ambiance

Great ambiance with a wonderful patio seating. The food was good. Service was okay. Been here 4x and the server somehow always forgets something everyone I have been there. Food was a little pricey considering the ingredients is not necessarily healthy."}
{"text":"I have been to Culinary Dropout a few times, and have always had a good experience. The happy hour options are great, and so is the food! The outdoor patio is also great to enjoy (weather permitting). I definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Thank goodness someone took over what once was pink taco, aka yuck city, and turned it into something worth stopping in when in Scottsdale. Fox Concepts yet again has made a success and a place I think I will actually return to. 

To start with we had a delicious plate of cheese and meats from the anti pasta menu, along side with some marinated olives and bread w/ olive oil. Just enough to get our taste buds excited and just enough to have my boyfriend (who is not into fancy smancy stuff) say \"give me some more\".  These went nicely with our beers (they've got a great list), my mother's martini (which she seemed to enjoy), and my brother's gin on the rocks (he says they carry a gin that is very rare and delicious but the name didn't stick with me-sorry). 

All of our dinner plates were delicious; fried chicken w/ mashed tatters & biscuits (skin on chicken was a little on the salty side but very crunchy), salmon w/ apple and rice, grilled cheese sliders(who could mess those up?), chicken salad, prime rib dip (served with onion soup instead of au jus, yum yum), and the patato ghesicuto (pasta- I know I can't spell but it was yummy too). Around the table, everyone seemed pretty satisfied.

My only criticisms would be that we were seating just to the side of the kitchen, enough to be able to look inside. I dig places that leave it open so you can watch your foot and the chefs are aware that the client is aware of whats going on BUT I did watch one man on the end prepare countless dishes without gloves on. He went from cutting and laying out proscuitto onto creating their carmel kettle corn dessert (scooping with bare hands), to setting out what appeared to be the fondue app. Yes, there can be worse things that happen in a restaurant but as someone who has worked in food service, it made me squirm a bit. I suppose that's why it's called Culinary Dropout.

...oh, and the music was a bit too loud for me. Great joint for out with friends on the way to the bar or I would think for happy hour but not for a family dinner (my Grandma had to barrow a flashlight from the waitress it was so dark)."}
{"text":"Had to give this place a try based on the concept and reviews. 
Great place to dine and play with friends but done expect to have a quiet conversation over your meal. The atmosphere is big and loud with live music in the evenings. 
The food had exceptional moments and even those dishes that missed exceptional where just off the edge.  
The menu is creative if a bit limited and exceptionally fresh. Build your own Antipasti is a nice way to start and if you get there early order the Korean rib cap which is a favorite but runs out early. 
Come to have fun, enjoy the loud atmosphere, people watch, corn hole and have a very good food and beverage along the way."}
{"text":"A few friends recommended Culinary Dropout, so gave it a try on a Friday night.  While it was busy, it's a very large space with outdoor seating, and we had no wait for a table.  It's in the Scottsdale Waterfront area, many restaurant choices so guessing you can always find a spot to eat without a long wait.

The menu seemed a bit small, but some good choices.  I had the Rainbow Trout which was fantastic and I'd have it again in a minute!  My girlfriend had the Kale Salad with Bacon.  I tried it and liked it, but she thought it was so/so (too much dressing for her taste).  They also had a Bacon Bloody Mary on the menu (though neither of us tried it as we were having drinks later).  Would go back to try that.

If you are very conservative or a bit stuffy (or planning on going with someone who is), be prepared as it's a bit \"hipster\".  One odd thing was that they had a live musician.  \"Interesting\" choice of music...he started playing a Quiet Riot song (\"C'mon Feel The Noise\") but as more a folk song.  Not really our thing so didn't stay long after dinner (there were more lively venues elsewhere in Scottsdale).

Would go back again, though there are other great selections in Scottsdale that I might go to first."}
{"text":"Junk food favorites mixed with fancy delicacies :) First time I went we ordered the soft pretzel bites with provolone fondue. It was the perfect combination of stadium food and wonderful cheese. Main course was the asparagus, tomatoes, bread and olive oil and the salami. We did get the olives and I have to say this was one thing we weren't a huge fan of. The fig preserve that comes with the bread is a must try! For dessert we got the caramel popcorn custard. I have never tasted anything so amazing ! They also have tons of fun drinks and the service is always great but casual. A lot of nights they have live music. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Never disappoints. Beautiful atmosphere and delicious food!

The pretzel fondue appetizer is the best ever!!!"}
{"text":"Well, my husband and I LOVE culinary dropout ...they don't have one in Southern California yet that I know of but we usually make it a point to come here every time were in AZ. We visit family here and my husband works here so when we get the chance to come we always do. We have never been disappointed . I love the cheese platter- pretzel anything there- drinks are always spot on-. We spend usually 2-3 hours each time were there just drinking and eating till we can't move. We usually go mid day and a lot during the week which is why we've never hit a real busy time. Tonight well be going so it'll be our first nighttime visit. Can't wait - foods great and drinks are creative"}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere. Great service. Good drink selection. Small menu but very good food, especially the appetizers. Good for groups. Good tempe location. Easy parking with valet avaliable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, and the bartender we had (Liz) made amazing cocktails that were balanced and fun."}
{"text":"I have had those amazing pretzel balls as other people's leftovers, but last Friday was my first official Culinary Dropout visit! I have to say it was a success.
I was pleased and a little surprised that it wasn't too crowded at about 5:45 on a Friday. We were seated right away. The server was really nice and helpful. I was skeptical at first, because there aren't many vegetarian options, but they were happy to modify my meal.
They told me about a vegetarian black bean soup and brought out a sample for me to try which was nice! The soup was really salty, and also no whole beans, and I prefer some whole beans in black bean soup. I ended up not ordering it and went for the grilled cheese sliders sans bacon. I hadn't had a grilled cheese in ages and it totally hit the spot, yum! I liked that it had tomato on it too. Plus it was a good amount of food for $10, so that was nice! The fries aren't the best. Some were mushy and some were too crispy, it was just an odd combo. But they weren't awful or anything. I'd totally come back though, good service and good food!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the weekend in Scottsdale, celebrating my girlfriends birthday.  During our stay we had the pleasure of having dinner at this location.  The restaurant was clean, the service was on point, and the food was amazing! We definitely will be returning to both Scottsdale and this restaurant in the near future!"}
{"text":"Just another FRC restaurant. I had a terrible, experience here but it was mostly staff related and I will probably never go here again.

3 stars for the meatloaf and decor."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would...cuz the server was AMAZING! Here we are, on vacation and we get treated like we are in a 5 Star restaurant. I didn't expect much from the menu, but we dug right in to the pretzel fondue and kick a** sandwiches(must get the grinder) at lunch. Bryors recommendation were spot on! 3 Jalapeño Lemonades+delicious bites+super funny waiter=6 Yelp Stars!"}
{"text":"This place really ruined my friends birthday dinner, cancelled our reservation 30 min before we got there after they called me 2 hours before to confirm it. So they said it was a miscommunication so they said to come in we come in and were a party of 15 they only have table for 8 and said thats the best they can do ... Manager was beyond rude . I hate pulling the race card but the majority of us were hispanic and i felt we were treated bad for that reason. Food was ok service was horrible but the place was really nice nice decor horrible host and server so sad."}
{"text":"Worst experience and understand why it's \"Culinary Dropout\".  First we asked for a table for four and were told a table was being cleared....then watched two groups of the same number get sat prior to us. Next we ordered a cheese plate and received just that - cheese (including a cheese spread) on a plate - with no crackers or anything eat the cheese with. Then we were offered bread \"on the house\", which was not and we got charged for both the bread and the cheese. Ridic"}
{"text":"Eh...its okay.  Had the salmon, thought it was good.  The appetizers are good, the PBR in a paper bag a little tongue in cheek.  I think the problem is, that this place is too trendy and the food is just too average for me to want to push through the crowd to try and secure a dinner spot.  Its super loud inside and the bar is extremely crowded.  Everyone is pretty.  Not complaining, just saying that I wish the food was just as pretty.  The menu is a mish mash of comfort food and whatever trendy restuarant ingredient is hot that week.  Still, its nice to have another option when you're scratching your head and wonderfing where to go when you are next to the mall."}
{"text":"I bookmarked this restaurant before our trip to Vegas because the name sounded catchy. It's inside the Hard Rock Casino by the pool and thankfully, they were open for brunch cause we were out all night :)

First, we asked our friendly server what was the best hangover cure drink. She recommended Prairie Oyster shot made with raw egg, worcestershire, tabasco, salt and pepper. It did not sound or look appetizing but we were brave enough to try and it was actually not bad. Then I ordered the Capital Green made with white tequila, cilantro, mint verdita, pineapple and sparkling wine. It was a bit heavy and strong but I'm not complaining here. It was just what I needed after the shots...lol

Next, we ordered the Pork Belly Nachos to share. The nachos were made fresh in-house piled with flavorful pork, cheese, guac, sour cream, and beans. For the main course, I got myself the Honey Drizzled Fried Chicken with homemade buttermilk biscuit, coleslaw, and mash. Simply mouthwatering! The chicken was perfectly crisp, tasty and juicy. It's been a while since I had fried chicken this good. My buddies got the Grilled Cheese Sliders and Shave Prime Rib Dip. Both looked awesome as well and by the look on their faces, they enjoyed them. Breakfast items start at $8 to $14, sandwiches from $12 to $18 and entrees go for $18 to $27. Cocktails are about $12 average. My Fried Chicken was $22. Pricey but it was worth every penny.

We really had a pleasant experience at this restaurant. Good quality, big portions, delicious cocktails and super friendly staff. Plus it was not crazy busy so we got seated right away at a table with a nice view of the pool. Worth checking out if you're staying at the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Close to giving this place 5 stars if not for the rude valet staff.

+decor/ambiance - beautiful large indoor and outdoor space.  Tons of bistro lighting and entirely hipster.  
+service (except for valet) - very friendly and kept checking up on us.
+food.  Everything we tried was delicious 
Gorgonzola chicken salad - nice balanced salad with a lot of flavor and creaminess from Gorgonzola 
Butternut squash cannoli - perfection!  I love pasta with butternut squash and this did not disappoint. 
Monkey bread - if you like desserts with a texture contrast and temperature contrast, this was delicious.  Parts of the dessert were crispy from the oven and paired well with the ice cream.
+cocktails and drinks - all the cocktails had an interesting twist and were interesting.  I ordered the Room Service and was super happy!  The alcohol is well masked by the strawberry and I could have drank a few of them easily.

-valet staff - so we came around 8p on a Monday and maybe valet service already ended for the night but there are signs everywhere that state valet parking only.  We pulled up to valet and the guys there were all busy talking and ignored us for a few minutes.  Finally one of them said park it yourself.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure I was going to write this as I sit here but I will, since I have plenty of time.  We came here, my friend and I because her dog died and she needed a day out.  We came for lunch around 2pm, the hostess told us we could seat ourselves in the \"yard\" area.  We did.  We watched other tables get service. We finally said something and the server apologized and explained the communal seating area is where we were supposed to sit when seating ourselves. Lunch was ok, but bill for two drinks and two lunches with tip $92 for two.  Our server wanted to leave for the night and we stayed so we cashed out so she could leave, but we were catching up as old friends do and three hours we served ourselves by going to the bartender.  So will say, service great from Chelsea after bartender talked to manager about our situation.  Manager never came to fix anything however.  Needless to say I think we will go else where.  Great concept though."}
{"text":"I was very concerned to go here when my neighbors invited me out for dinner with my family when I saw the reviews from the last week. Ignore any bad reviews!!! We went tonight with reservations at 4 PM. We were greeted by all friendly staff members, seated immediately and the ambience was awesome! We had a very attentive server, Who was extremely knowledgeable of the menu. He was also very friendly. All expediters were very friendly and super fast too! The drinks were good, and all food was really good also. We  brought our kids and they loved the food and said it was worth the drive!! We drove from Gilbert. One of my kids got the pretzels and cheese from the adult appetizer menu, one got the chicken tenders from the kids menu, one of us got the sweet corn ravioli, and one got the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Two of us decided that we wanted to share the chopped Italian salad and the bistro steak. Steak was cooked perfectly and they even split our plates in the kitchen for us so we didn't have to do it ourselves at the table. They were very accommodating! We will be back especially when it's cooler so we can enjoy the awesome patio with corn hole, foozball, and ping pong!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch with my mom and grandma (who are the cutest lil women you'll ever know) and the food was absolutely delicious!  I ordered the seared tuna salad and it was like a party in my mouth, so many flavors.  My mom and grandma shared the grilled cheese sliders.  I tried to get them to venture out but these weren't just any grilled cheese so they were utterly pleased with their selection.  The service was just okay.  I really enjoyed the décor and the open seating but we sat in metal chairs that make it uncomfortable.  I looked at everyone sitting in cushioned seats with chair envy."}
{"text":"I crave this place all the time! Had one of the meat and cheese boards and it was amazing! It was served with this sweet jam that is addictive! The ambience of this restaurant was perfect for a relaxing dinner. Our server was hands down one of the best I've ever had! Dinner was amazing as well.. my ravioli was unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with friends and loved everything we had. The service was great, the food excellent.
Cant wait to go back, and will follow up with better information. Great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. There was a hiccup with our reservation that they kindly credited us for, they sat us 30 mins after our scheduled time. There was games and activities that you need to be on a list for. If you plan on being there a long time, no issue. The food was average. Pub burger was $13, steak tacos $17. You are paying more for the atmosphere than the food. The service was great though and everyone was friendly. They gave us complimentary apps for our delay, which we appreciated."}
{"text":"So I've tried this place a few times and every time I order something different. Twice now I've gotten sick from their food and once I've had to return a raw burger! Seriously this place is literally a culinary dropout because they can't cook their food properly. For instance, ordered the fish and chips got sick overnight.... order the chicken with ham sandwich got sick overnight.... and then I ordered a medium well burger and it came raw in the center. Only good thing about this place are the drinks. Service is ok, waiters are always forgetting things because of how busy it can get there. Never going back, I've given you multiple shots of making up for your food but I'm done."}
{"text":"Gawwwsh that's some good pretzel rolls. Much bigger than I thought and so sooooooft.

I scraped the salt off, which I think most people would love. But I preferred less salt.

We ordered it for takeout and all our food came out quick and perfectly ."}
{"text":"Had a fun NFL Sunday brunch here: atmosphere, food, and cocktails were great. 4.25 stars

Food: 3.5, Service: 4, Atmosphere: 5
Cost to worth it rating: 3.5 (brunch items and cocktails ~$10-12)
Opentableable: yes, kid's menu: yes
Return worthiness: yes

Highlights:
- Atmosphere: big and open, fun and welcoming. There's an area out back that is covered but feels like it's outside and games behind it (corn hole, ping pong, shuffleboard). Lots of TVs for game day
- Cocktails: unique offerings. For bubbly they had more than mimosas. I had one that had fig vodka and elderflowers and another with gun and strawberry.
- French dip: my hub really liked it. 4 stars
- Breakfast sandwich: as big as a burger with egg, bacon, and avocado on a bun. 4 stars
- Breakfast potatoes: little uneven squares of potato goodness cooked just right so they are tender inside and crispy outside. Bonus for the large sprinkles of salt to top it all off. 5 stars 
- Grilled cheese sliders: cute pair of squares of the sandwich. 
- Milk for kids: huge pint sized one in a plastic cup with a lid. Usually my lil guy guzzles down the tiny cup they give him and needs a refill.

Midlights:
- Breakfast burrito: not bad but bit boring with an omelette like egg and couldn't taste the chile apparently in it. 3 stars 
- No coloring menu for kids: don't expect this everywhere but would be fitting here since I saw a bunch of kids there.

Lowlights:
- Didn't have room to try the desserts which sounded yummy.

Enjoyed our brunch here and would come back for another meal."}
{"text":"If you love piss poor service, and bar tenders that act like they are doing you a favor, this is the place to be. Maybe the worst service I've ever had, the bar was empty, walked straight up. Bar tender completely ignored us for at least 15 minutes. Made eye contact several times while he talked to people sitting at the bar.  When we first came in, friends from out of town said they wanted to come back the next day when we had more time, by the end of the visit we were making different plans."}
{"text":"Culinary is pretty good. The biggest complaint is the price for me. Their food is decent but I do have to say, their nachos with pork belly is worth ordering without a doubt! Pretzels and cheese are easy to share and fun. Their drinks are good but outside of happy hour, it seems so pricey and they're not great, just good. A lot of the time, I get feedback for whoever goes that their food is just ok. I think the environment is fun and that's what I think you're paying for here."}
{"text":"This is serious fun and good food. The missing star is price and the difficulty of getting a parking spot - nearly impossible some days.  Keep cookin and inventing."}
{"text":"This restaurant had been on my hit list for a long time. Finally the day after new Year my son and I went there for lunch. And I must say they lived up to all the hype I had encountered until that time. 
We ordered the pretzel fondue, green chili stew and the mussels. And after we were done I saluted the kitchen. Wonderful food. Tasty, unique and a great representation of what these guys do. 
The fondue was a great starter. The mussels were just superb. Not sure where they source then from, but they tasted so good. And the stew, what can I say. Couldn't stop chowing down on it. 
The restaurant is well laid out and beautifully decorated. 
The only weak link in the chain was inattentive service. Especially considering it was not really busy. But this is a problem that exists in many restaurants as they try to reduce operating expenses by being too aggressive in cutting staff. 
Overall, I will return."}
{"text":"The food was great and the staff just super. We had a horrible experience at the goose brewery so left there and went to this restaurant and got such friendly service and delicious food.. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Great place for romance!
Can eat outdoors under the stars, next to your in personal fire pit!

Food quite good, but eclectic...very comfortable seating, live music entertaining"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT gastropub with an atmosphere that sets up a fun night out. I wanted to try something from the local brewery, so I got an Epicenter Ale made by the SanTan Brewing Company. Off the tap, the beer had a nutty flavor, a little malty, and not very bitter. It was okay.  The bartender also gave me a slice of bacon when requested for my friend to nibble on during the long wait.

Ah yes, the long wait. We were told 15-30, and actually hit an hour. It was Spring Training, so I understand the wait time, but just tell us an hour! They made up for it by giving us free pretzel balls and fondue and a side of roasted beets. If eating cheese didn't make my stomach hate me, I'd probably just order a bowl of that fondue and eat it with a spoon. 

I split the Roasted Chicken Salad which came with apples, pistachios and gorgonzola on mixed greens with a light dressing. Very good. And such a generous portion!  It was the size of almost two entree salads.

For an entree, I ordered the Butternut Squash Cannelloni, which was decadent in a buttery sauce. They could have been more generous with the mushrooms and brussels sprouts, but I will admit that the cannelloni was plentiful.

If I were to ever go to Spring Training again, I would definitely hit up Culinary Dropout again."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, cocktails are legit, buffalo chicken meatballs are amazing and they have a happy hour."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Loved the Sangria and fried chicken.  Service was incredible slow, rather it was nonexistent.  And music was way too loud."}
{"text":"I was recently visiting Tempe and stopped by on a friend's recommendation. This is honestly one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had in AZ, even after attending ASU and living in Tempe for 4 years! 

To begin with, the atmosphere is unbeatable. Parking isn't the best but we lucked out with a spot!!The building is huge and one of the only \"bar\" scenes I've been to in Tempe that isn't cramped, a million degrees and smelly. Not in the slightest. It's decorated industrial chic and has bulb lights strung all over. The space is very large and well-cooled (even on an 85+ degree night) and there are I think 3 bars!? There are ping pong tables and corn hole and a few spots to sit and enjoy your appetizers and drinks. Even a live band came on (and they waited until the final 4 was over to bring them out which I highly appreciated). We waited about 40 min for a table but with the above factors it wasn't bad at all. They text you when your table is ready which I also appreciated vs having to hold on to one of those annoying buzz things. The table we were sat at was very spacious, had super comfy giant chairs and good views of the basketball on TV. 

The server was totally hipster but very nice and speedy! Everything on the menu looked awesome and it was hard to choose. We had the pretzel bites as an appetizer ... They were good! I ordered the steak and potatoes for dinner - it was cooked PERFECTLY and was seriously amazing. My boyfriend ordered ribs which he loved and my two friends each got salads that looked awesome. For dessert we got the monkey bread which was perfectly shareable! 

I will 100% be returning here for dinner EVERY time I'm in AZ!"}
{"text":"There's a guy in the bathroom that sells $2 bills. That was cool. 
The biscuit is good too."}
{"text":"Got there pretzel bites and fondu.  Pretzel was cold. And fondu was Luke warm.  Not what we  expected.  We won't be trying it again"}
{"text":"This place is SO great! Such a good vibe, and the food is unreal. The porkbelly nachos and chopped salad are my favorites! Huge portions and tons of flavor! Our service was also outstanding! Devin is a phenomenal server!"}
{"text":"Anne was our server last night and was absolutely incredible. She was knowledgeable, friendly and really tied the experience together. I had the Korean style rib eye and enjoyed every bite. Plus the desert flower drink should be a permanent resident on the drink menu. 5 stars would absolutely come back. 

Cheers"}
{"text":"Update: MK the manager made everything right! She was so awesome and truly went the extra mile to ensure that we would come back!

This place had good food but awful service. I am writing this review as I sit at my table waiting. First they brought us prosciutto when we ordered hot capicola, and then when we questioned it they swore that is was capicola, it wasn't. Then we waited 30 minutes for one of our meals that the said would be on its way out and it never came. In fact the waiter forgot to put in the order. This place is great for ambiance and the food tastes great, but we will never be coming here again due to the poor service we received. Oh and we had this poor service while having not one but two waiters."}
{"text":"The service here happens to be fine.... But the whole \"concept\" misses the boat. In fact, it doesn't even get to the dock.  I ordered bresaola to start. It was as if someone took a scissor, shredded it, and threw it on a plate. No olive oil, no green, ... Nothing.  The bistro steak served with Gorgonzola was tasteless. I substituted the fries with asparagus which was served ice cold... Not room temperature.... But ice cold. I consider this place a culinary rip off and wont be back."}
{"text":"Good food, cool atmosphere, but the prices are a little steep.

I like Sam Fox concept restaurants, but for the fun live music and pretty interior you end up paying a little more than you probably should. The server was very kind, and the band did an amazing job of sounding like Jimi Hendrix. The burger was thick and tasty, and the beer samples are appreciated. The liquor, like the food, is slightly higher in price than you'd pay at similar restaurants. 

The Culinary Dropout is a neat place, and I'm sure I'll return at some point, but competitive prices are not of their concern."}
{"text":"Good, though I wasn't overly impressed. Very nice server, and reasonable prices, though our group didn't leave there thinking, \"That was amazing. Gotta go back!\" I should mention that the inside appearance is very nice, and I'm sure I'll give it a second try sometime down the road."}
{"text":"I was a little overwhelmed by the size of \"the yard\" when I first walked down the long dark hallway and saw the restaurant in its entirety.  And while, yes it was very loud it was a fun and vibrant atmosphere.  The service was fantastic.  I've found some \"hipster\" places to also have what I refer to as \"rude hipster too cool for school service.\"  However this was not the case with Culinary Dropout.  Our service was fantastic.  Our server offered great suggestions and checked on us frequently.

We ordered: deviled eggs, balsamic beets and the grilled bread.  The eggs and beets were both fantastic.  The bread had amazing flavor but was too crunchy and tore up my mouth.

My husband had the fried chicken, and although it's not as fabulous as fried chicken in Atlanta, it was delicious.  He loved the honey drizzle and the huge buttery biscuit.  The portion size was just right for a big, filling dinner.

I ordered the Korean steak and it was prepared perfectly and had an explosion of sweet and spicy flavor.  It was fantastic.  I'm so glad I ordered the bread because it definitely needed a carb to soak up the sauce and balance out the sweet heat.  

We will be back, with friends soon!  I better brush up on my ping pong skills too"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! 

The environment was awesome, but I also love live music. It was a little loud (kind of hard to hear the person sitting next to me), but we didn't mind. 

The red sangria was super good, and the service was phenomenal. Coleman checked on us multiple times and made sure our visit was great. There was an extra order of the pretzel bread and cheese floating around, so another waiter brought it to us for free, and that was super nice. I had the thai chicken wings. They were amazing. 

I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food is over priced and it's nothing original or special. More of a hipster presentation - between the food and how everyone's presentation of clothes is. I'm pretty sure everyone that works there doesn't wear nonslip shoes. It's an awesome restaurant concept but besides that, it's another \"hipster\" \"trendy\" spot for those kind. Have not returned."}
{"text":"Ordered the fried chicken entree for lunch and was pretty impressed. My waiter was very friendly and recommended the dish (as I was debating between a few dishes). 

The chicken was crispy and tender. Even the breast piece was pretty moist. The coleslaw was really good and had a unique ingredient - cilantro! The biscuit and mashed potatoes were both pretty normal. The coating on the chicken was a bit too salty for my taste but nonetheless, it was very yummy. If I go back, I'd try a different dish."}
{"text":"Culinary drop out is a great fox restaurant. Not my favorite for dinner but for lunch with friends it's wonderful.  The atmosphere is so fun and different, with big comfy chairs and large dining tables, makes it easy to sit and talk for hours.  

As you can expect from a fox restaurant all of the food is great, definitely recommend the pretzels and fondu to start, and their salads are great.  The only thing I didn't like was the grilled cheese. It is a little bland and the cheese was not melted all the way, not ideal, but it may also be a matter of preference on how you like your grilled cheese. 

And just like every fox restaurant service is key. They are constantly making sure your water or drinks are full and very attentive to your needs. Overall this is a great place for lunch, I'm sure it's good for dinner but I associate the menu more with a lunchtime gathering, or a happy hour affair."}
{"text":"CA native; this place was recommended to me. Great pretzel appetizer with Queso dip. The Mac Burger was juicy and filling. The Kale and Sweet Potato salad was excellent.  All my favorite ingredients were in this dish. 
The portion size was plentiful and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"I moved here from San Diego and have had a really hard time finding decent restaurants. I've taken my dad and best friend here when they came to visit. This restaurant met my expectations. The food was delicious and the wait staff was helpful and friendly. The ambiance and decorations had an urban hipster vibe. Great for appetizers. Korean Brussels  Sprouts, Kale Salad and Charcuterie were fantastic."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in tempe. Great atmosphere for food and drinks! Highly recommend this location or Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Place is HUGE! Fire pit, corn hole, indoor/outdoor bar and here is the best part.... GREAT FOOD! 
Younger crowd on average, but good cocktail menu and service. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Went there last evening with a friend.    I looked over the menu, thought, hmmm, they have chicken curry.    Interesting.    This isn't a Thai restaurant, is it, I thought?   Well, I happen to like chicken curry so I ordered it.    It was quite good.    I asked for chili peppers on the side since I like hot.    It had big pieces of chicken, potatoes, julienne cut green beans, onions, mushrooms and plenty of sauce that could easily be mopped up with the rice.    Definitely would give any Thai restaurant a run for its money.   He had the grilled cheese sliders.     I don't normally like bread, but I saw it was bathed in plenty of butter or ??.    Anyway, it looked good, so I had a couple of bites.    Plenty of flavor to cover the fact that I don't like bread, and just enough cheese and bacon that I MIGHT consider ordering it.    I had a glass of their merlot.    I can't remember which one it was, but it was at the top of the wine list.   I had had the pretzel bites in the past with the cheese.   That is really good if one likes soft pretzels.    Yummm for sure.     We sat away from the crowd, since happy hour was still going on.    It was a bit noisy, but we could have a conversation without having to say \"What??\" or shout.   There is seating on the patio with plenty of misters.    I didn't feel like taking a shower so we sat inside.   Anyway, it was cooler since the temp for the day had been 114.   Would I go again?   Probably if I was on a date.    I don't care for the fact we  have to valet park our cars, but it wasn't my problem, and they do make it especially convenient."}
{"text":"I was HOPING I would have loved this place more than we did. The aesthetic appeal and atmosphere were fabulous. The food (main courses) were not impressive at all. Four out of five of our meals were bland and overpriced. However, we did order the pretzel bite appetizer and it was amazing! Overall we wouldn't dine there for a meal, just drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Stopped here while visiting Long Beach, after peeking in on a few of the restaurants on the board walk we chose Yard House. Huge portions for the price, and great attentive wait staff even at 10 pm."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a group from work. There were tons of open tables and areas but they seemed to take a very long time to get us seated. Then they took a long time to get our drink orders. Was kind of annoying since we were trying to get in and out in an hour. 

That being said, the food was so good. Many compliments around the table. The burgers were huge. I had a salad with seared tuna. I asked for an alteration on the dressing and it was done. Looks like a fun place for a date."}
{"text":"Love this place, but BRING BACK THE OLD CHIPS! Nachos ain't the same you know what I'm sayin'?!??"}
{"text":"The Mac Burger is phenomenal. Also the waitress staff is very responsive."}
{"text":"It's interesting how different locations of the same restaurant can create a different feeling.  I love the Scottsdale location.  It's one of my favorite restaurants.  But the young college student vibe of the Tempe location was not for me.  

This location is near ASU.  Good choice of music, but loud.  The inside seating was unusual, with many longer \"family style\" tables.  Interesting decor of tin siding, old wood, unusual lights, and comfy sofas in the \"outside\" seating section.  Which doesn't seem like outside as it's covered.  The restaurant is located in a huge building called The Yard.  There are three restaurants and in between are ping-pong tables and lots of cornhole boards.  One competitive foursome was intently focused on the game for the entire hour we were there.  

The food is, of course, the same delicious stuff as at the other locations.  I'd drive anywhere for those pretzel bread bites with cheese fondue!  The prime rib dip sandwich is one of the best I've ever had.  Kale and strawberry salad with chicken or salmon could easily be an entree.  My son loved his Pub Burger.  Usually I'd stick around for Monkey Bread for dessert, but we were on our way to a Segway tour around the Tempe lake.

I do have to give 5 stars for the service.  Our server was friendly, answered all questions with a smile, and made our requested ingredient changes seem like no problem."}
{"text":"Would have given them four stars but a noticeable edge on the part of the server and the fact that they don't serve Coca-Cola products brings it down to a three."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  I had the burger and my husband had the chicken club.  Would have been 5 stars but there was a mishap and it took quite awhile to get our food.  They made it good.  Thank you Adam"}
{"text":"This review is for their Fall 2014 Restaurant Week menu.

For being a drop out, this place is excelling in the tough world of Vegas dining. 

I ordered the House Salad to start off with, a Turkey Pistrami sandwich to assuage my appetite, and a Bourbon Black Bottom Pie as a closure to my meal.

First-Course - House Salad: Just like the name states, it's a house salad. Standard greens, nothing creative, this comes with buttermilk ranch. I was praying that this basic salad wasn't foreshadowing what was to come next.

Second-Course - Turkey Pistrami: This made up for the first-course. Served on a pretzel roll are slices of peppery turkey pistrami and lightly-dressed coleslaw, this sandwich is on the heavy side, but it's delish! 

Third-Course - Bourbon Black Bottom Pie: I love this. I can eat this all day long until I barf. This is a rich and chocolaty ganache with salted, crumbled graham crackers that form the bottom of the pie. The light sweetness of the chocolate and the salty crackers pair together perfectly.

Service: Good.

Overall: I'm giving Culinary Drop Out an \"A.\" The salad may have been \"blah,\" but everything else was terrific,"}
{"text":"Last time I was here with my boyfriend we had a very bad experience. The service was slow and the waitress was inattentive. However this time the experience was MUCH different. The manager spoke to us directly and addressed the last time we were here and told us that tonight was on him. Our appetizers, main course, and drinks were all out very quickly and were delicious. Our server Payne was great and very friendly. The pork ribs were unbelievable. They were cooked to perfection, the barbecue sauce was delicious, and the meat was so tender it was literally falling off the bone. After dinner they recommended the Monkey Bread for dessert. This is a cinnamon apple bread with ice cream and it was to die for. All in all, this experience was great and because of tonight we will be coming back soon. They took care of us and showed that the customers are their number one priority."}
{"text":"Bad food.  Bread was more like crackers, mussels were over cooked, shredded pork nachos had almost no shredded pork.  Seats were uncomfortably hot and management refused to turn misters on.  If you like terrible food and hipsters, this is the right place for you."}
{"text":"All I have to say is you HAVE to try their Manhattans! Amazing cocktail menu and food was superb! Definitely consider this place one of my regular hang out spots."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Reminds me of the Duce.  It has that laid back hipster feel.  The great thing is it breaks the mold on traditional eateries in that it encourages you to get up and mingle, or sit back on a couch by the fire while you eat.  It is an extremely casual atmosphere with great decor.  There are various activities like cornhole and ping ping to play.  

The food menu is a great.  There is a wide variety to suit all levels of adventure.  The fried chicken is a great choice.  

The drink menu is plentiful and they have very creative twists on old classics."}
{"text":"The food was good. I had the 36 hour ribs. They had me at 36 hours. They were very tender and the jalapeno flavor was very well done. I also had the fried chips as an appetizer and they were very tasty. Plus a wide array of beer to choose from."}
{"text":"Had a pretty bad experience my 1st visit to this restaurant. Went there for a buddy's birthday. Food took a long time after we were ordered. Expected on a Saturday night. The problem we had was that the food came out cold and out of sequence. Apps and entrees came out around the same time. I wasn't planning on coming back until I met one of the guys that works in the kitchen out having a beer. Johhny convinced me to give them another try. So glad we did. Great food and service. Thanks Johnny. Definitely gonna make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"I came here with my best friend and his wife on a work trip to Phoenix and really enjoyed it. The decor was cool, server was nice, and the layout of the restaurant was really big and open which I liked. We had the ribs, kale salad, and Thai chicken wings all which were awesome. Their cocktails looked rad so I will try one next time when I am in town."}
{"text":"I only give three stars because this place wasn't spectacular but It didn't suck. 
We got there for our 8:30 resevation and ordered the Pratzels and Cheese dip which I think was my favorite part of the meal. The drink I got was good and came with and extra tequila shot on the side. The Fried Chicken was moist but I Didn't care much for the honey drizzle and my mashed potatoes and biscuit were cold. They did give me a free birthday dessert which was really good a rich. I would have to agree with other yelpers though that this restaurant is overpriced and overrated."}
{"text":"We were in town for SPRING TRAINING.   To all our baseball fans,, this is a place you have to visit.  

Friday night,, around 6:30 we called for reservations,,  we were told 9:30pm.. as we were walking, we asked for 8pm, and the receptionist said she would put us down for 8:00.  We arrived at 8:00 and were seated within 5 minutes.  This place is LOUD with live music,, a great atmosphere,,, but if you are seated in the middle of the restaurant,, it will be difficult to have a conversation at your table.  

We had a great time,, our waiter (with a Boy George look) and our waitress were very personable,, and engaged in a welcoming conversation while taking our drink orders and throughout our experience.  

Our party of four,, we ordered the fried chicken, Green chili stew, salmon, and shrimp Caesar salad.  We enjoyed our appetizers of Prosciutto deviled eggs, and pork cracklings,,  which were quite tasty.  Our meals came out timely,, considering the amount of business on a Friday Night.  Dinners had great flavors,,   we definitely will return.  

A happening place, plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"I have been to this location and the one in Tempe. Pretzels and fondue are enough for 3-4 people, or a meal in itself for 2 people. Beer selection is decent--mostly craft/local brands. I ordered a burger and fries; my guy ordered fish and chips. They were nothing remarkable, but not bad; large portions. I liked the Tempe location a bit better as the staff were more attentive and professional; our waitress was wearing her winter jacket to stay warm indoors despite it being the 60s that day."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to have lunch outside on a patio, my friend and I decided to stop in here.  We were able to get a nice table by the front door which was great for people watching and the couch seating was very relaxing.

I ordered the Pub Burger which came with bacon, Havarti cheese and fries.  I commented to my friend that this probably wasn't the most healthy meal in the world.  Not 10 minutes later a friend walked by who I hadn't seen in a while.  He mentioned that he had a heart attack just two weeks ago as we both looked at my burger and fries.  He was drooling with envy because he can't eat this stuff anymore and I was thinking that I should probably start to cut back on this type of meal.

The burger was good though.  Large and perfectly cooked.  Crispy bacon and plenty of cheese.

This was a nice place for a leisurely lunch.  Next time, I'll try to order something a little healthier."}
{"text":"Went with some friends on a Friday night, had some concerns about getting seated but everyone there was incredibly accommodating and we were seated in just a few minutes. The wait staff was very pleasant and full of recommendations for the table and our meal was spot on. Will absolutely recommended to others."}
{"text":"If you can find parking this is a great place to have lunch on a nice day.  The indoor/outdoor layout is very nice and open.  I sat at the bar and recived great service.

My Ialian grinder was very good and the side salad was excellent."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere... If in Scottsdale make sure pay a visit. Good for moderate sized group, perfect for relaxed conversation. Live music adds the right amount of ambient sounds without being overpowering. 

Food:
Ordered the pretzel appetizer, there's PLENTY to share so make sure you or your group are fans of soft heavenly bites of sea salted dough :)

Ribs- Falling off the bone tender and the sauce was especially tasty. I would order an extra side for additional dipping... The entire meal was superb!

I can't find the name of the cocktail I ordered but I thoroughly enjoyed it! A very creative and appealing drink menu some savory some sweet!"}
{"text":"Friend chicken is delicious. Atmosphere is pretty cool, I loved the decor. Never been on a Friday or Saturday night but I'm sure it's probably a fun place to do happy hour or dinner with friends. 
Service was okay, we went for an early lunch and there weren't many people there."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and plan to come back whenever I'm in town.  The dishes are tasty, the staff is down to earth and very friendly.  You can enjoy your food inside or alfresco. They have a good selection of dishes and cocktails. This is my go to spot for a refreshing cup of joe (generous size), a hearty breakfast and a drink to start the day off right."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, nice staff, and great food. The pretzel bites and smoked salmon are definite must haves. They have great cocktails too. The Moscow mule and blueberry beer are were my favorites. The beer in a bag is fun to because you don't know what you're going to get. Great spot for causal dinner and drinks if u want to be out but not in the club scene."}
{"text":"My wife and found this place last summer when we first moved here to PHX.  We had the soft pretzels and fondue which was amazing.  The sweet corn Cannelloni is one of the greatest things I have ever eaten... in my life.  Go here.

P.S. Get dessert too.  Monkey bread and the carmel custard will make you drool."}
{"text":"Well, you gotta love the looks and liveliness of the place.  Definitely this is an improved use of the real estate (formerly endless automotive bays seemingly seldom used/abandoned).

And my teens and I thought the food was great, service ok.  But the $50 spend for lunch was, er, not sustainable.  Perhaps I can make Culinary Dropout a good spot to sneak away for NFL on Sundays with their cheap-guy/cheap food menu and little beer bug deals.  Nice that they have that."}
{"text":"I post purely from a drinks and entertainment perspective. The band they had playing on Friday night was fantastic! Their outdoor bar area has the perfect view of inside the restaurant and their bartenders were fun, friendly and entertaining! My old fashioned is a yummy burboun drink but very few people know how to make it well. The bartenders at culinary dropout nailed it! Will definitely return on my next trip from NJ!!! Great place to get a drink and have a good time :)"}
{"text":"If yelp allowed half ratings, this would be a perfect 3.5 stars. It was good, but not as awesome as I'd been led to believe. I might or might not go back, I'm a bit torn.

The atmosphere is great- it is actually long picnic-style tables rather than individual ones, plus an outdoor area. Our group of 6 had no trouble finding seats for lunch. We ordered a few rounds of appetizers and meals. The pretzel fondue was good, but I have to say I love it more from Brat Haus. The burratta with pears and bacon syrup was great, but I wish I would have tasted more bacon. I had the house smoked salmon which was pretty good but not great. The salmon was delicious, but I could have done without cracked pepper on the poached egg, and it was a bit messy to put the whole thing together (toast, salmon, capers/sauce, egg) into an edible combination. The onions that came with it were super strong and I pulled those off right away. That being said, there were enough other things on the menu that I might be willing to give this one another shot."}
{"text":"The service was good. We were greeted right away and served on quickly. We even got free nachos on the house - which was cool! The nachos were pretty good too! 

However, the actual dishes we ordered were extremely salty. I got the veggie/squash or something cannoli, and my BF got the salmon. Both dishes were cooked okay but just really salty. The portions were also rather small. We spent way too much money and left unsatisfied. Won't go again if we visit the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I like the business of the place and the sass of the staff, but the food is over priced for the item. Fried chicken should not cost $22 a plate. I am totes down to drop that on a steak, but not on chicken that I can probably make better at home. I didn't have the chicken, I had the pub burger which was the normal cost of a burger and fry at a restaurant. 

My thought is that they should have smaller options at a lower cost. The obesity problem in America is from places like this that over charge, so the person gorges themselves to get \"their money's worth\". Where are the tapas? With a name like Culinary Dropout I expected smaller dishes.

Final note, I also hate how their valet is on the side of the railroad track instead of on Ash as it used to be. Do you guy have any idea the dangers your poorly located entrance causes because people do not signal???? 3 times this week idiots have slammed on their breaks as I cross the track the bust a U turn to get into the valet. 

As a local resident of the area, I am sick of nearly getting into an accident when I am within 1000FT of my residence."}
{"text":"Servers and environment are unmatched in the valley. Food was also great, but probably tasted better just because the experience is amazing."}
{"text":"My experience at Culinary Dropout is akin to the first time I listened to College Dropout, Kanye's first commercial album. My argument in three points:

It is as billed: Culinary was billed by friend as a great place to grab some grub and have some fun while doing so. They got your basic adulting activities (cornhole,  shuffleboard, etc.) and an extensive beverage list. This was a great combination, especially since there was a wait for our table, which can be expected on a hot summer's day.  These amenities are what set it apart from other eateries in the area, similiar to college dropout at the time of its commerical release. There were the references to jewelery and the finer things in life like othet albums at the time, but with the self awareness to discuss these things in relation to society as a whole that set it apart.

You get the unexpected: College Dropout had its social commentary, but it also gave you some timeless hits that lean less in that direction.  We had to wait some time for our table, and for our patience the house manager got us a free app and round of drinks for our time once we were seated. This is the first time this has ever happened for me at a restaurant and, much like the second half of College Dropout, very refreshing and unexpected.

Guest verses: Kanye spent many years making  beats for others,  and as a result got many others to drop some verses on his album. Our experience at Culinary also included some guest appearances that made our experienxe that much better. Shoutout to Leah, our server who was one of the nicest people on earth.  Shoutout to Huss Brewing, for their Koffee Kolsch, sending me to lactose heaven.

This is my analogy, I don't care if it's a weak one, cause I'm sticking to it."}
{"text":"My husband & I had a quick lunch at the Phoenix location by ourselves a few months ago & decided we had to take the kids to check it out. Since we live in Mesa we chose to visit the Tempe location by ASU this time. We are a big fan of the pretzels with cheese. The best part is that the cheese is kept warm by a small flame beneath it (we also enjoy the pretzels with cheese at The Tavern Grill & Teakwoods). 
It was fun playing ping pong with them & the layout of the restaurant is very roomy."}
{"text":"I don't know why we waited so long to come here. We were here on a Monday evening and waited about 5 minutes for a table. We started with the pretzel bites and fondue - Oh my goodness / it was amazing. My daughter got the fried chicken dinner and it was the BEST fried chicken we've ever had- hands down. I had the fried fish meal. It was good. Then, we shared a Monkey Bread dessert. Wow. So good. The environment is great as is the service."}
{"text":"This is a very rockin place to eat. We split an order of ribs and still got full. We had the seared tuna salad and it was great. The fries with the ribs were first class but the Cole slaw was served warm and was not as good as it could have been. If you are in the area this is an awesome place to kick back, have a drink and get some great food. Definitely an upscale casual place."}
{"text":"I've always been impressed with every location of Culinary Dropout I've eaten at but this Vegas location truly takes the cake for them all. I recently stayed for multiple nights at The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino and found myself drawn back night after night to dine here, by myself or with friends. 

The food is consistent, tasty, and the staff blows the roof off any dining establishment I've been to. I have to take a moment and call out those that served me... Gary, Matt, Dillon, Jake, Hayley, & all the rest I met, because they had an awesome vibe, great anticipation of my needs during my meal, and above all else they made what can sometimes make for a business trip of meals alone into a warm, pleasant experience. That's why I keep going back, because I felt like I was spending my meal with friends. If you haven't tried Culinary Dropout I urge you to give it a try you won't be disappointed. 

Personally I recommend:

Starters: Sherry Beet Salad, Deviled Eggs, Hummus
Cheap house salad with gorgonzola dressing

Entrees:
The fried chicken (it's amazing)
The Meatloaf

Dessert:
Banana Creme Pie (trust me on this)"}
{"text":"The service was prompt and friendly, the food was good on all three plates!  Great atmosphere with nice people watching with NASCAR, spring break and Cactus League all in town!"}
{"text":"We tried this place out on a Friday night for a friend's birthday. While we waited for our table, we sat outside on the patio with our drinks. The patio space was nice and had additional tables for people to sit and eat. Since it was a warm night, we decided to eat inside. We were seated right in front of the stage at a long table. As the night worn on and got more packed, sitting at this table wasn't exactly ideal because so many people were standing behind us from the bar and bumping into our chairs. It was also pretty dark inside so I did have trouble reading the menu (that's what the flashlight app on your smart phone is for I guess). The ambience of the restaurant was very impressive with the purple tile walls and huge chandeliers. It reminded me of Vegas?

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful on drink and food choices. Our table started with the kettle chips and pretzels with provolone fondue. Ummm just have to say, the pretzels and fondue were fantastic!!! Huge hit at our table and we are still raving about them days after we ate them! The chips were also good.

I decided to split the chopped vegetable salad and sweet corn canelloni with my boyfriend. The chopped vegetable salad was a nice light note with a ton of vegetables and worked well with our entree, the sweet corn canelloni. The canelloni was really good but if you're hungry, I wouldn't recommend splitting it. For us, we knew it was going to be a night of drinking so we didn't want to over-do it. Perfect amount for the occasion. I stuck with my usual white wine for the night but many of my friends ordered speciality cocktails. I was able to try a couple and thought they were strong but good. 

As we were leaving, the band came in and started playing. We could hear them through the loud speakers on the patio and they sounded pretty good, playing a few cover songs from popular pop/rock singers. It was definitely a fun place to go for a friday night and would return."}
{"text":"First of all, loved the open garage doors in the back. The rest of the interior design was great. Everyone who served us was polite and very friendly. The turkey pastrami on pretzel bread was totally scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Loved the Culinary dropout.  Had a great evening talking to Christian. ...great bartender at culinary dropout.  The pretzel app is super.  Atmosphere here is the best.  Check in out!"}
{"text":"OMG YUM! The boyfriend had a Velvet Death and Bacon Infused Bloody Mary. He was in hog heaven. The fried chicken is delish and comes with a honey drizzled biscuit that literally melts in your mouth. The Bistro Steak was like crack and produced sounds of bliss from across the table. Try the Salted Caramel Custard for desert. I wanted to lick the cup clean!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for comfort food, Culinary Dropout has the best cheese fondue / pretzel bites I've yet to try. The interior feels like home despite the hustle and bustle of its busy hours, and there is always something to see: cooks in the kitchen, live music, etc. 

This is also a great place for after work happy hour with the build-your-own appetizer plate that can appease your whole department."}
{"text":"Came here tonight and was pleasantly surprised. I had the ribs which came by recommendation of the bartender. For not being smoked they were absolutely outstanding! The sauce used on them were thick, spicy, and sweet. Only knock I had on the meal was the coleslaw, as it was very dry. Overall a great experience and I look forward to returning again."}
{"text":"Fast service! Pretzels were out in a jiff and quite tasty. They are big so be prepared to have several bites a pieces.The pastrami was unique and filling. Nice music, comfy and chill vibe. Excellent quick dinner."}
{"text":"I'd love to give 4 or 5 stars, but I can't. It was so loud. I mean DEAFeningly LOUD. And I'm a loud person!
The place is super cute, I love how it overlooks the pool.
Our waiter was great, friendly with recommendations and an offering of free dessert!
The food......yummy!
I got the tapas style appetizers for my meal; golden beets with goat cheese (Yes!), pimento cheese with almond (YES YES) and olives (OMG YES!). Oh, and lets not forget the crusty bread (DROOL). So I didn't care for their \"famous\" pretzel bread and fondue. It's not that it wasn't good, I just didn't really dig it. Everything else was super!
Will definitely come back, hopefully it wont be so loud."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very trendy, and fun. The food was awesome. The pretzels and cheese were super yummy. I had the beef stroganoff, and it wasnt heavy like normal beef stroganoff, it was elegant and I loved it. My Dad and friend has the meat loaf and said it was delicious. definitely will eat there again!"}
{"text":"The pork belly nachos were the best thing i ate. Very cool spot with a nice ambience. They have a great selection of drinks and beers. Great place to eat and relax after a day of shopping at the near by Scottsdale fashion center."}
{"text":"I met a group of friends here before the Chevelle concert for dinner. Its a pretty good size dining area with a bar and there's an outside patio decorated nicely. There was live music which is a nice touch and she was unique to say the least. The waitress was really nice, on point and was always around. The only con about the employees is you'll have no idea who they are since they are all dressed in street clothes. Someone  ordered the pretzel bites with fondue and everyone enjoyed them. I ordered the grilled cheese sliders (made with American cheese) and they were good if you're under 12 lol. Not what I expected for $12 but maybe I had my expectations set too high for this place. A couple of friends ordered the chicken club and it was huge, they liked it. I'll probably try this place again and order something different :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I wish there was one near my home, I would be here all of the time. he menu is fabulous and the beer selection is absolutely fantastic! Plus, the vibe is great! Staff are friendly and genuine. I like to sit on the patio during the day and at the bar in the evening. I have been here many times and have not yet had a bad meal. The appetizers are all good, especially the antipasto selection. And the friend chicken? WOW!

You can't go wrong here..."}
{"text":"I recently planned a 40 person event at the Culinary Dropout all from my office in Michigan.   Since I did not attend, my review is based solely on the special events team.   Alexia Haley, special events manager, was a delight to work with.   She provided me ideas on how to make the evening event special.    We reserved the patio area which was perfect with heavy appetizers and drinks.   I received lots of emails later in the week saying everyone really enjoyed it.    Special kudos to Alexia and the entire staff for making this a memorable night."}
{"text":"Went to \"The Yard\" at Culinary Dropout at night. Place had plenty of open tables (inside and outside) yet the hostess, and the server, both refused to seat our group of 8-10 people as we \"couldn't commit to full meal orders\". This was at 10pm by the way.... 
Won't be bringing any large groups by here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Drinks were great... Food not so much. I ordered the frittata and it didn't feel wholesome or fresh. Kind of boring actually. I will give this place kudos for good drinks and great service though. The waiter was super sweet and very patient with my indecision, haha! I would come back here to hang out but maybe after eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"As far as hip Tempe places go, this is a great place. I figure this is a lound happening place for people to go and see and be seen, have a great drink. For the rest of us that want to eat something nice, well.  if they are trying to make a cool foodie place they missed the mark.  The food reminds me of Chili's or Applebee's, not a Culinary place. Too over priced for a place that doesn't hit the mark."}
{"text":"Is this becoming a nationwide trend? It's apparently the age of the chain gastropub. And I gotta say, I like it.

Culinary Dropout is part of the Fox Restaurant Concepts conglomerate of restaurants; the original Culinary Dropout is in Fox's homebase of Scottsdale. I can haz franchising rights in Texas?

I'd heard good things about Hard Rock's atmosphere, and while that mostly disappointed, Culinary Dropout was a fine time. We made reservations for 9 people on a Saturday night, which were completely unnecessary. The restaurant was about half-full, though part of the reason is it's huge with a great, casual patio.

We immediately got a free serving of Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue--delicious--a result of a duplicate order. Great start. I was mostly drawn to the impressively diverse, if pricey, beer menu. Woe is me; instead of embracing diversity, I ended up sticking to the very delicious Joseph James lager all night. There's some good stuff on there, and if you've lost all your money gambling on the tables there's also a \"paper bag special\" for $3. Our waitress described it as Bud Select or something of that ilk; we stayed away but I found it cheekily fun.

Menu prices are quite reasonable after getting eye-gouged by the Vegas exchange rate. The Meatloaf--my choice, was exceptionally large and quite filling. Ends were more than a little burnt, but I enjoyed the \"meaty\" part and enjoyed the sides. The Shaved Prime Rib Dip got huge raves from our waitress, who was excellent all night, as well as my fellow diners who ordered it. The Fish & Chips and 36-Hour Pork Ribs were called as decidedly average.

It's a really great ambiance, and if the Hard Rock had more of the \"zoo\" atmosphere that I was promised, I think the night would've been even better. As it is, it's a short cab ride from the strip and was still a great time regardless."}
{"text":"We Love love love this place. The food is excellent. The fried chicken and the pretzels are unbelievable. I give them a 4 since 90% of the time the service sucks but worth it anyways"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! While most people wouldn't complain. .. the portions are just too big!! The waitress suggested the soft pretzels with the cheese sauce. Delicious!  But it was enough to feed a small football team!! (There were 2 of us). Then our meals came out...I had the black mussels.  They were so delicious but omg there was SO much of it!! A huge dish...easily enough for 3 people!  My husband had to finish mine because mussels don't 'keep' as well as his sandwich would. It's a bit of a waste but still really good!"}
{"text":"I had such an awesome dinner here last week! We were only in the Scottsdale area for a few days but I'm so glad we got to visit here because the food really is great!

Apps - for starters we had the korean brussels sprouts and the beets with goat cheese. The beets were passable, nothing very exciting, but the brussels sprouts were out of control amazing! They were perfectly crispy and tender and the sauce was incredible. I could easily get 2 orders of these and call them dinner.

Mains - We ordered the ribs and fried chicken. The ribs were cooked just how I like them, fall off the bone tender, and the bbq sauce is sooo good. The chicken was fried perfectly and was so juicy! Also it comes with mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw and a delicious biscuit so bring your appetite with this one, it's a TON of food.

Service was great, our server was super nice and attentive. 

I love that they have live music every day! We came on a Sunday, so I was bummed to hear that they only have live music on Sunday mornings, so next time we'll just have to come earlier or on another night."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is Awesome, my wife has been bugging me to take her here and I am glad I finally gave in, Marisa was our server and went above and beyond what I expected! We had Pretzels with Cheese fondue and BBQ nachos and more. I highly recommend this place. Very hip and a extremely fun vibe all around. Coors light on draft is a plus in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Fox Restaurant concepts means not only incredible menus, it means impeccable customer service.
To be fair I sent an email to tell them my comment on yelp  I received an email in reply within a half hour that wasn't canned but sincere and personal."}
{"text":"Food and service were above average, nice being able to sit around a fire pit and play ping-pong while waiting for our food to arrive."}
{"text":"Although pretty expensive... Culinary/The Yard is one of my favorite spots for game day. The charcuterie board that you can build yourself with all of your favorites is always my go to. Numerous different meats, cheeses, snacks, etc. makes it really easy to get a little bit or everything and even turn it into a full blown meal."}
{"text":"After waiting for an hour and a half, the food comes and it was slightly warm, salty and not worth the wait. No explanation of what was the delay. The staff is running around with cleaning supplies and all of the dishes were pulled out. Extremely disappointed and I have no desire to return. It looks like the heath inspector should pay a visit. It's sad because I was really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I went to Culinary Dropout on a random Tuesday. We were seated very quickly and greeted by our server and waiter. I wanted good comfort food and I came to the right place. Homemade chips and dip for an app, dinner we got the prime rib dip and club sandwich, dessert was the monkey bread. 

It is rare that we finish everything we order, but we finished everything! The food was amazing, it wasn't heavy at all! It was filling but I didnt feel guilty for eating everything. The drinks were strong, well worth the price. 

I can't wait to go back. The service was spot on, it is a fun bar and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of True Foods and wish we had more Sam Fox restaurants in Houston. I had the kale, sweet potato salad and am now trying to replicate the recipe on my own because it was delicious! The patio was nice and the decor is great here."}
{"text":"Our friends have been dying to take us here. We went on a Friday night and the place is packed. Usually a good sign for a good restaurant. We started out with a few beers, decent selection. Bf got a jack and coke which was very watered down. We sat out in the Yard, which is very nice open area with TONS of games. Service was friendly and fast. So, for the food:

Started with pretzel bites and cheese fondue. This carb filled, melt in your mouth guilt trip is DELICIOUS. Definitely a must order if you're not watching your weight. 

I ordered their 36 hour jalapeno molasses ribs. I was pretty disappointment. The ribs were dry and had a strange flavor. Expected something way better for $23. 

Boyfriend ordered the prime rib dip. The au jus was really good and the meat to bread ratio was decent. HOWEVER, they put a bunch of mayo on the sandwich, which they do not mention on the menu. Boyfriend hates mayo. Who puts mayo on a prime rib dip? He opted to the soup of the day as his side, which was actually fantastic. It was a bean, sausage vegetable soups. 

If you do not like big crowds, do not come here on the weekends. Great atmosphere. Hit or miss food. Will be willing to come back to try other things before giving a higher review."}
{"text":"Super fun - good food - went before Hamilton at Gammage.  Made for a very good outing"}
{"text":"Meh, this place is what it is. The decor and overall atmosphere is pretty cool but the whole games thing doesn't seem all that original anymore. 
I've had both great and very mediocre service here over my few visits. The pretzel and cheese fondue is to die for, and usually the fried chicken is a good choice. Craft beer options are pretty limited here. At a certain time at night, this place turns into college party central, which isn't really my thing."}
{"text":"Staying at the Hard Rock, I wanted to check this place out.  It looked really cool inside, and their menu looked good and reasonably priced. 

The inside was in fact really cool.  I liked that you could see all their fresh fish right there. We got a nice cozy booth.  I ordered the fish and chips.  The cod was very tasty, moist, flaky perfection. The chips AKA french fries were cold...bummer. 

Overall it was good.  If you're staying in the Hard Rock, it is worth going to for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the Fondue! If you've never been you have to have to have to get the  provolone fondue with the pretzel rolls. So good! but warning it is very filling. If you come in a group of three or more than one is fine with a meal but if there is just two of you, be prepared to take some of your lunch/dinner home or eat a salad afterwards.  

I also love the French Dip sandwich I get it every time because it is just so good and its one of my favorite sandwiches.  
Other good ones: fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Culinary dropout after hearing so many wonderful raves about the place.  Came here with two others and a baby and we were seated immediately.  The decor is modern and funky and I loved the giant crystallized chandeliers.  I couldn't believe they had la fin du monde in bottle here; unibroue is one of my favorite breweries and I've never seen it available in restaurants before!  Kudos!  I decided on the fried chicken for my meal, and man it did not disappoint; skin on the outside was perfectly fried and the chicken was incredibly juicy.  They also lightly drizzly some sort of sweet sauce on top that makes the dish unique.  The sides were all tasty but not breath taking.  I tried my sister's pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun and that was also really tasty.  

I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"We dined here yesterday and loved it!
I had originally requested a patio table when making reservations online (after reading reviews that it could get loud inside) and I received a phone call earlier in the day that patio was first come first served. Completely understandable and call was appreciated. We were given a table towards the back inside and didn't feel the noise level was too bad. We ordered the pretzels and an antipasto plate- we were enjoying visiting with friends and didn't even notice there was a delay in the kitchen, but the manager came to the table and comped them! Wow. I wasn't impressed with the two different cocktails I ordered- one was the After School special- it had a raspberry infused tequila and served with a Modelo, like a sweet version of a Michelada. The other was the El Madador- this one was really too sweet and the other just didn't taste good. But the food more than made up for it as well as the service. The pretzels are amazing and a must order and the cheddar pork cracklings were delicious. I had the fish and chips- the batter in the fish was slightly soggy and over salted, but the coleslaw served with was excellent. The 36 hours ribs, the turkey pastrami and the fried chicken were enjoyed at our table as well. All and all, I would stick to appetizers and beer or wine on my next visit, but would come back due to service and ambience ."}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour specials Mon-Fri 3-6pm includes appetizers and drinks for a reasonable cost. Good atmosphere inside and out with an outdoor patio lounge near the pool, which also has fire pits. Looking forward to returning soon and trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"Matt the bartender was fun. The place is nouveau but fun,\". The food is fabulous. Large portions!"}
{"text":"Was ok....trendy....cool lighting.....chairs were ginormous inside.....SMELLED LIKE ROTTEN SOMETHING! 

We got use to the smell, but if it was not for our friend, we would have left. The smell was just raunchy. My gf said maybe it was because of the meats and cheeses they serve. 

Prime dip was bomb, fries ok. 

All the other food was average. 

Just your typical Fox Concept. 

Yard House is right across the street and much tastier."}
{"text":"The food is just OK.  I liked the pretzel bites, and they definitely the slew of good brews they have.  But Meh I wasn't wowed.  Go there for a before dinner snack, and you'll be happy"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last week and it was okay. I tried their steak sandwich and I'm not sure if it was the cheese mixed with the sauce but something clashed for me I ended up removing all the cheese and just ate the meat! Lol. But their fries were really good. The set up is nice I honestly will give them another try soon mostly because the environment was great. The customer service was great as well. Definitely somewhere you'll want to sit and enjoy I went on my lunch break so i ordered at the bar. Will go again.



Updating my review: I'm a very picky eater, and cheese is one of those picky things for me on food. so it's not to blame on CD it could have very well been my funny taste buds. The prices are great. The staff is great. The environment is great and I'm sure there's plentiful other dishes I can try that suits me!"}
{"text":"Ambiance and cocktails are the star at this place.  Good variety of above average bar type food."}
{"text":"I'm late to the Culinary Dropout party... really late!  But better late than never.  I'm not really sure why it took me so long to head to CD, especially considering I live and work within a half mile, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed my first meal here.  (Thanks Todd F suggesting we dine here, and for forcing me into sharing the soft pretzels with provolone fondue app).

Speaking of, do not miss the soft pretzels with provolone fondue... it's worth the extra calories for the fluffy, cheesy, heavenly goodness!  I'm already dreaming of returning to have more of these!  Following our shared app, I went with the Chopped Vegetable Salad.  Considering Culinary Dropout is a Fox Restaurant Concept, I was half expecting this salad to be the same as the one they serve at Sauce.  Afterall, the description on the menu is exactly the same as the Sauce version.  But it doesn't do it justice!  In addition to the \"asparagus, corn, and avocado,\" this version has artichokes, pistachios, and a sweet honey dijon vinaigrette.  I had them add shrimp to it as well, and it was incredibly fresh, delicious, and filling.  I'd totally return and order exactly the same thing since I loved it so much.

Hannah was our server and she was awesome.  She was friendly and informed us of specials right off the bat (including prices).  She also mentioned that they serve Pepsi products, which I typically find that servers neglect to tell you; especially if you're a Coke person!  Todd and I both had Arnold Palmers to drink, and Hannah (and the other CD staff) made sure we constantly had refills - I was even given a refill to go, which was much appreciated.

Overall, I had a great experience at Culinary Dropout.  It may have taken me two and half years (since they opened), but I will likely add this place to my regular lunch location and be there again soon.  Anyone up for lunch at CD tomorrow?!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a cool restaurant. The name alone had me booking a reservation even before looking at the menu! Vegas is so full of what I call \"Las Vegas Templates\" that this was a breath of fresh air. Even though it's a cab ride off the strip, I've always found the Hard Rock Casino to be cleaner and less smokey and an awesome experience. Seeing Pete Townshend's guitar, Jimi Hendrix's coat, Paul McCartney's lyrics make hanging out a lot of fun. This restaurant had it all...a great menu where it's hard to choose, excellent beer and liquor selection and friendly & knowledgable staff. We were immediately steered towards the pretzel bites and fondue appetizer which was insanely good. I had the Korean Style Ribeye Cap that was 5 stars. Was also sold on the \"Smashed Irishman\" cocktail; Jameson Irish Whiskey, Guiness redux and mint which was phenomenal and had me ready to head to the blackjack tables, at which point, common sense luckily prevailed. I'm done giving the city of Las Vegas any more of my money, but can't say I feel the same way about Culinary Dropout. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I've no complaints about this place. I've been here a few times for dinner as well as just drinks and to hang out. Just a few highlights:

- Order the pretzels with the cheese fondue and come back and thank me later.
- Brown bag beer special is fun - can 'o mystery beer for less than 3 bucks
- They have an extensive beer selection of draughts and cans, including tallboys - everything from low-brow domestic to crafts. 
- Venue is half indoors - half outside, with a cool patio and some lawn-type games like cornhole
- Cocktails are delicious - the Drunken Panda is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the hype.  But for me it didn't live up to it.  Don't get me wrong the food was good, but it wasn't great.   I had the shaved prime rib sandwich and my friend had one of their burgers.   Both of us agreed that our food was fine but wouldn't seek it out again as there are enough other restaurants to try.

Regardless, the environment was fun.   Really loud, but nothing wrong with that as long as you expect it.   Also, the live music playing while we were there was very good.

Staff was attentive and friendly.    Honestly the only downside was that the food didn't wow us.   

If I stop in there again, it will just be for drinks to listen to the music."}
{"text":"The pretzel fondue is one of the best appetizers anywhere. The food and drinks are pretty good but nothing else stands out."}
{"text":"The food here is really good! My husband ordered the Seared Tuna Salad and said it was awesome, and I ordered the 2 Eggs Any Way, and it was simple (no fancy concoctions), and delicious! 

I left one star off because although the servers are super friendly, service is a bit slow, but don't let that deter you from coming here!"}
{"text":"Great location across from Scottsdale Fashion Mall and the service here was good. Still busy on a Sunday night but we were able to walk in and get a nice table on the patio so that was nice. Our server was definitely attentive and happy to offer recommendations and answer questions. My friends got the Fried Chicken which they loved. I got the  BBQ Ribs with coleslaw and  fries. They had a good flavor and the sauce was good but I doubt I would order them again. The rib where super fatty, and the meat didn't come off the bone very easily. The coleslaw was heavily dressed. And I had to complain but that was the smallest serving of fries I've ever seen at a restaurant. Although they were tasty.  I'm usually a huge fan of the food at Fox Restaurants but this one didn't hit the mark. 

I would got back and try something else but I'd probably more likely go to one of their other restaurants first."}
{"text":"Having a tough time leaving a review here...
I'll start with the ambience is great. It's hip. It's trendy. It's cool and the people are pretty nice.  The lack of dress code is neat imo. 
The food was great!  The pretzel rolls and the fondue was really fun and great tasting and the fried chicken was outright delicious. Loved that skin!!

Honestly I'd rate this whole thing five stars except for the small fact that we sat on the outer edge of the outside eating area.  The misters were on so strong that the couch-style seating was so wet that it instantly soaked my slacks and my underwear and after five minutes the back of my shirt was damp. 
An hour after leaving the restaurant and getting home, my boxers were still completely wet
Seriously I'm not being dramatic.  It was obnoxious. 

That being said, I would return.  I just will wait until it's winter and those damn misters are OFF."}
{"text":"So, I was really excited to try this new Pink Taco replacement (thank god). I went with some girlfriends on the 8th day it was open. We sat outside in a super cute corner couch/table area. The food was good and the service was good but it was not exceptional. We got the chicken (yum) and the grilled cheese was fabulous too. Excellent string fries! We liked the comfort food aspect to the menu. We ended with the Monkey bread. The server told us it would be 15 minutes but somehow it was cooked double time because it came out less than ten minutes later. The Monkey Bread came with a scoop of ice cream and it was shear heaven. I would come back here to skip dinner and go strait for the Monkey Bread!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and everything has just been okay. Not bad, at all. ...but nothing that WOW'd me.  I've even tried something different each time I've been here. Service has been good and helpful when trying to decide."}
{"text":"Awesome for groups or work team events. I really liked The Yard section for games. I just couldn't eat anything due to food allergies. My work team of 20 really enjoyed the food and games"}
{"text":"See a lot of reviews under saying the same thing about the service it is TERRIBLE. I tried to give this place a few different chances at different hours in order to really get a better understanding of what is going on with the service. It is always bad from what I have experienced, it did not matter the time of day or the day of the week it just is not good. I enjoy the food though so it did make me come back after having a few different bad experiences with the service. The food is always tasty with a lot of flavors and interesting menu.

The bartenders are so slow, heard the couple next to us saying that they were chatting with each other over taking orders for the last 3-5 minutes. Ordered a Whiskey/Coke and it took over 10 minutes to get it to me. The bartender was rather passive aggressive taking everyone's order. I never let one time dictate my overall opinion of an establishment but this has been over the course of 5 times going here. The food is not worth having to deal with this service so I would choose other places where the customers are appreciated more."}
{"text":"Exceptionally knowledgeable server had gluten free suggestions. New eclectic loft decor with play areas. Appetizer order form for prosciutto, olives etc. Fish and chips were orange and had spicy coating. Bbq ribs soso, over priced. Shrimp Cesar salad ok, nothing special. Banquet rooms seem to have $100 per person minimums.... It's new, trendy for hip young professionals."}
{"text":"We are local but visited the hard rock with some friends and had the opportunity to try this great place. We caught their happy hour and ordered the sangria, pretzels and antipasti. The antipasti was a great surprise selection of some of their meats, cheeses and starters. I wish it had come out before the pretzels because I got too full on those. Overall both dishes and the drink were fantastic! The ambience is very low key and relaxing but the music is loud. The service is also slow. They pride themselves on making everything fresh and I understand fresh takes time. Just be prepared this is not the place to go in a rush or in a time frame. Great for a long, leisurely meal though."}
{"text":"Walking in the door it would seem like this place would have exquisite food.  I had the Warm Italian sandwich and pretzels with cheese.  The food took a long time to come out.  The pretzels and cheese are highly touted, but taste as if they were made by Chef Boyardee.  The warm italian sandwich was rather pathetic.  Culinary dropout?  I doubt it.  Probably forced out."}
{"text":"This place was great! We went with a large group and literally ordered 2 of every appetizer! All of it was amazing!

Needless to say, I was pretty full by the time my meal came out, but I ordered the Fried Chicken and it was delicious! 

The run down:  service was great, the food is good, the atmosphere was a bit loud, and for whatever reason a Moscow Mule doesn't come in a Copper Mug. 

I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went in with a group of 9 after Spring Training baseball. Service was slow. Food mediocre. One person in our party had undercooked chicken. The establishment did not rectify the issue satisfactory. Paid $17 for a sandwich that was average, at best. With so many choices in Scottsdale, we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I like it better than the other locations. It has a great vibe, lots of games and an awesome food/drink selection. Would recommend for dinner or late night drinks. Thinking about going there for nye this year!"}
{"text":"I get food comps every week at Hard Rock and have eaten here a few times but no more.

First off, things here are way overpriced.  $4 for a small bowl of fried chicken skin, $12 for a pretzel and dip, over $30 for a small portion of steak and fries.  I didn't care about this too much because it was always covered by the comp, but when I compare the value and quality of what I can get here with what I can get elsewhere, it just doesn't make sense.

As to the actual quality of the food, some of it is OK.  The grizzini (breadsticks) are pretty good, and I recall the ribs being decent.  Every steak I've had here has been awful though.  I've gotten both the korean rib cap and the steak with the dolce gorgonzola.  Both are pre-cut, usually fatty or gristly, and very small portions.  Maybe 6-8 ounces or something like that.  Service here has always been a bit slow, even though they are never busy when I go by (usually around noon on a weekday).  If you sit at the bar at least your drink service will be a bit better, but food still takes a while to come out.

On my most recent visit I went with my girlfriend and we were seated quickly near the only other two occupied tables in the restaurant.  Several servers/waiters came by but never stopped to even ask for our drink orders.  One server walked past us briskly without stopping and greeted us, but that was all!  And it's not like I have a bad rep here -- I order simply and always tip.  The girl at the front even knows I usually choose to sit at the bar.  After at least 5 minutes we got up and left, giving our menus to the girl at the front and told her what happened.  She went off to yell at the waiters and we went next door to Mr .Lucky's.

Let me tell you, Mr. Lucky's is amazing compared to this place.  Most casino's 24 hour cafe style restaurants are pretty normal but they really do have great food here.  The prices look a tad steep, but the quality/portions are great.  One of the best casino cafe burgers, definitely the best casino cafe chicken fingers, the short stack of pancakes is great, and the steak & eggs is the best I've ever had (yes even better than the vaunted Ellis Island's).

So, long story short, screw you Culinary Dropout.  Your food ranges from average to plain awful, and your service is the pits."}
{"text":"The second star is for our server. This place has okay food, however that's about all they have. The management is pretty lousy.  My friend got kicked out for being to loud. In any other bar that may make sense although he had a mental disorder. The security guard stated that everyone gets one chance before they get kicked out.  We asked security if we could get a manager to the table and no one ever showed up for about an hour and a half until after we had ate already and my girlfriend complained and talked to head of security, then one of the three managers offered us free food after we paid. The security guard also stated they have been open 7 months and don't want to ruin their reputation. I have never heard of any rules against anyone with a mental disorder being in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretzel bites with cheese fondue sauce!!

How can you not want to come here just to try these delicious little bites of crunchy, salty bread goodness with a creamy, delectable cheese sauce?! The bites are huge and they give you a huge bowl of the fondue which as a big cheese fan I truly appreciate. Better ratios means extra dipping. 

I loved the open concept of this restaurant, a huge open kitchen, tvs for football watching, a cool patio with eclectic decor and funky chairs with a view of the pool and a fun menu with dishes like \"Ma... The meatloaf!\"

We ordered a couple craft cocktails that were amazing too, including the Room Service and Pistols at Dawn. Both great choices!"}
{"text":"Warm, soft pretzels and gooey provolone fondue, are you f*ng kidding me?? Ahhh, to die for!

Thirteen of us went there for lunch after my nephew's graduation from ASU and had a superb experience. First, we didn't have a reservation, just walked in cold. We were immediately seated at a large, dark wooden table surrounded by comfy chairs, in the space between the bar and the kitchen (foodie's heaven). The hostess and our servers were super nice, friendly, and knowledgeable.  A bacon-infused Bloody Mary made its way to my place setting, and  my oh my, it was delish! Just what the doctor ordered!  We noshed on those pretzels and fondue, along with plates of oysters (which I can't review since I'm allergic. Dammit.).  I had the fish and chips, which were fresh, crunchy and properly served with vinegar and slaw.  Others had salads, burgers, chicken fried steaks...everybody raved about their dishes, and everything looked great.

Service was perfect and a great time was had by all."}
{"text":"Pretty standard food. The patio here is amazing and great for lunch or dinner + drinks. Nothing on the menu has blown me away but they definitely get points for a great atmosphere, solid service and the ahi tuna salad is pretty legit!"}
{"text":"The pretzel dip was hyped but very underwhelming. The pretzels had the consistency and taste of dinner rolls. The antipasti choices were plentiful but extremely overpriced when compared to others. Decent beer selection. Limited parking so valet is the best option."}
{"text":"The staff here is EXTREMELY friendly. All of the waitresses that came to check on our table were wonderful and attentive. The food is also great and very reasonably priced. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. Starting with the size and ambiance.  Huge restaurant with many different areas. Central to it all is the bar.  Which takes me to the ambiance.  Great music pumping through the speakers, sports on the TV's, lots of college students hanging out. So very friendly waiters and staff. The Culinary Dropout is on the ASU campus.  There is a trolley stop just outside the restaurant.  Truly one of the better feel good restaurants I've had the pleasure of trying. I can only imagine at night or after a game. I'd bet this place is so alive.  Our meals were top notch as well. My potato and cheese Perogies with charred brussel sprouts in a lemon creme fresh sauce was amazing.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Tried the pub burger mid rare. The burger was done very nicely and the fries were on point. They even got the cook right. The games in the Yard were fun too. If you can look past the people that have a had a few too many drinks, it's pretty fun. My only complaints are the noise level and parking is an absolute nightmare."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places . With having an allergy to onions, my husband and I don't go out to eat much in fear of having a allergic reaction because a lot places don't take it seriously. My throats swells up and I cannot breathe if I eat them. So tonight we had a couple entrees, few appetizers, and then we split a salad and I specified my allergy very clearly. Well, after a few bites my husband realized there were onions in our salad. We informed our server and she took it away and got us another one. After losing my appetite from taking a few bites already of the salad that could kill me, I gave the new one to my husband to eat . Well, he pulled out 3 chopped pieces of onions in my new salad . Awesome.   So I go to talk to the managers, I work in the restaurant business myself so I usually try to avoid this, but due to the circumstances it had to be done. They joke when I ask \"are you the managers\"? They say no we are the head dishwashers , haha. Ok not funny , I have a serious problem here . I am so disappointed in the nonchalant regard that I received when discussing the issue we had tonight. It was NOT handled professionally at all . Hopefully I don't end up in the Emergency room tonight because of this . Everything was great until our salad came out with onions in it . Thank god I have an epi pen with me just in case. I can already feel my throat swelling up. We go to the Tempe Location all the time and have NEVER had a issue with anything. DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"It was a beautiful day in the neighborhood today, so eating on the patio at the Culinary Dropout was an excellent idea! The food was wonderful and the service was GREAT! This restaurant is a little pricey on both food and beverages...appetizers were decent in size and very yummy (still too costly) but the entrees were very small for the price we paid. The BIG problem we had was the filthy cushions on the very uncomfortable benches.  Not dirty from weather but huge stains from spilled food and drink! It was disgusting! Patio floor clearly needed to be swept too.  Will we go back? Perhaps...not sure..."}
{"text":"My first visit to this place. Friendly hostess, nice atmosphere, but after being seated we waited 5-10 minutes with no greeting or service whatsoever. No biggie...plenty of good restaurants in the area so we left with the experience of no experience at all."}
{"text":"Great little spot at the Hard Rock. Food and drinks did take a while, but honestly I didn't mind too much because of all the viewing scenery sitting on the patio outside. It overlooks the Rehab pool during the day."}
{"text":"I have been to the one in Scottsdale and in Tempe and like them both.  Great atmosphere, great service and fantastic food and drinks!!  I haven't had a bad experience once and have been there many times.  I am so glad they have one in Tempe now so I can go even more."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! I didn't know much about it going in, but I saw some good recommendations online so I thought I'd try it out. I appreciated the complimentary valet and the super nice waitstaff. My waitress helped me pick out an Arizona IPA that I ended up loving. And she recommended the antipasti happy hour above all, which was a SMART move! I feel kind of hit or miss about antipasti plates, but this was fantastic. There was a nice (but smaller) portion meat and cheese, but the plate was filled with all sorts of other goodies that I loved! I was traveling solo and the plate was a great meal on its own. They never made me feel bad for taking up a table and I never had to wait for water! Overall, one of my favorite restaurant experiences while traveling."}
{"text":"There is so much I want to say about this place but what comes to mind each and every time are those damn pretzels. I could eat a tub full of those pretzels and the cheese.  Yummy! It's the perfect accent to the pretzels. 

Why hasn't the movies theatre found out the recipes to those pretzels. 

The cheap salad with buttermilk ranch dressing. Wow that small salad packed a punch. I.loved, loved , loved it!

Next came this drink called ROOM SERVICE. It was so good. When I ordered this drink I didn't know what to anticipate but when I took the first sip......my eyes began to close and I was somewhere else.. can I order another one please.....

Then the band began to play Purple Rain............my heart sank but here comes the blond waitress to with my Room Service right on time.... 

I love this place and would definitely return."}
{"text":"First the good - the décor and service were great. The $12 pretzel bread with provolone fondue was heavenly (I would have preferred cinnamon sugar as a dip, or maybe in addition to the fondu, but that's being too critical maybe). For entree, I ordered the vegetable chopped salad. It came out looking delicious, but it was totally bland (maybe a different dressing would have helped?). The pretzel bread was this place's saving grace. The bill was $50 for waters, two entrees (burger and salad) and the pretzel bread. Waaaay overpriced for a pub. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The location is so cute- they have a fantastic venue that was set up for a wedding and the food is excellent, especially the pretzels. The brunch menu is limited but everything on there looked good."}
{"text":"you must get the pretzel fondue it is out of this world. the only negative is the parking situation and our waiter was a bit slow. Other than that, we loved this place as we do most Sam Fox restaurants."}
{"text":"Had a great time, great energy, great service, and a unique awsome menu. The only thing that I can say negative was the 30 minute wait after my reserved time, but if that's the worst thing to happen, you're doing a pretty great job to me!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a student at ASU and every time I come to visit, we ALWAYS have to come to culinary dropout. The cheese pretzel fondue is to die for, you have to order it as an appetizer! 

Everything that I've tried is amazing. Fried chicken is always a favorite. Last time I tried the butternut squash cannelloni... It was so fresh and flavorful. One of my favorite dishes now. 

You have to go!!!"}
{"text":"Just had apps and a couple beers at the bar, first the negatives: 1-although the restaurant was fairly empty was only offered either seats at one of the 2 bars or outside, 2-server forgot to put in 1 of our 2 apps, 3-pierogie app was just ok. Positives: 1-variety of servers were all friendly and attentive (other than previously noted issue), 2-app that was forgotten was comped, 3-soft pretzels with provolone, best I've had in Vegas.

Will definitely be returning to experience more of the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy-hour. The pretzel fondue is my personal favorite appetizer--As I'm sure it's many other peoples as well.
Haven't had a huge variety of items off their menu, but the honey fried chicken has been wonderful the few times I've had it."}
{"text":"My first (and last) experience at Culinary Dropout was not good. I'd say it was a total disappointment, but I wasn't exactly looking forward to dining there from the beginning. I was hoping the food would change my mind...not so.

A friend suggested meeting at Culinary Dropout for a recent Friday night dinner so my husband and I headed that way. I am not a huge fan of Fox restaurants, but our friend has somewhat of a connection to Mr. Fox himself, so we humored him and went along. I was well aware that it was a Friday night and we would have to wait, so I wasn't surprised when our friend informed us that it would be 20 or 30 minutes. No big deal. We ordered drinks from the bar and enjoyed the people-watching. There isn't a lot of room to wait, but we shoved ourselves in a corner and enjoyed the show. And holy crap, there certainly was quite the show! The people visiting this restaurant were some of Scottsdale's finest. Plastic surgery, skin-tight mini dresses, and gelled hair galore! I almost threw up in my mouth a little...

So yeah, did I enjoyed the people-watching? Absolutely, but it started to get rather old when our thirty minute wait turned into forty-five minutes and then over an hour. Our friend finally went up to ask about the wait and happened to mention his connection to Sam Fox. That brought a manager out rather quickly. Logan came and greeted us and apologized for the long wait. He also offered to buy us appetizers and drinks (I assumed that meant the alcoholic kind) once we were finally seated. That sounded great to us, so we stayed to wait a little longer. I also want to add here that the hostess (who was dressed in something that seemed incredibly inappropriate at a restaurant...shorts so short her cheeks were hanging out the bottom) was very sweet. She apologized regularly and kept us informed when it was almost our turn to be seated. And honestly, it wasn't the long wait that was so annoying...it was the fact that we waited more than double the time we had been quoted. 

So anyway...we finally got our table and our server promptly greeted us and we ordered our drinks. I had the mojito (which was pretty decent) and my husband had a glass of red wine that he enjoyed. Shortly after being seated, Logan, the manager on the floor, sent us over three free appetizers. Awesome! We had the burrata (very creamy and great flavor), the pretzel and fondue (not bad at all, but doesn't compare with Windsor's), and an order of bread and olive oil. After enjoying our free apps, we placed our order for the main course. I really struggled with what to order...the menu just didn't appeal to me at all...but finally decided on the grilled cheese sliders (sans bacon). 

And then we waited. And waited. And waited. Our server didn't come to check on us and the food was taking foooooreverrrrrrr. When it finally arrived (maybe 30 or 40 minutes later), I was not pleased. The sliders lacked any flavor and the little bread slices they were on were far too crispy to eat easily. After one bite, I let my husband finish them. He didn't enjoy them either. Our friend liked his salad, but was so annoyed with the long wait for our meals that he called the manager over again. I really did feel bad for the guy. He was clearly working his butt off, but something was going terribly wrong that night. In fact, we overheard him comp several other meals throughout the evening. He agreed that we waited far too long for items that have a four minute ticket time and offered to take them off our bill. Well, at least we were getting a free meal out of this whole ordeal. 

Needless to say, we were not happy with our experience at Culinary Dropout. The entrees were disappointing and the waiting time was ridiculous. Unlike many other Yelpers, I was not at all impressed with the decor of the place and the live music, while a good concept, was pretty awful. The guy there that night was singing covers of songs I like, but he just did not sound good. At all. Oh and we could barely have a conversation over the extreme volume in the place. What really sealed the deal? When we received our check...which we believed would be comped...we saw that they still charged us for our drinks. And those drinks were not cheap. I would have had no problem paying for drinks (they were fairly tasty and we didn't have any problems with them) except for the fact that we had been told that they would be taken care of. Unless we heard the manager wrong...which could have been possible since it was so incredibly loud in there. Either way, it was a surprise and left a bad taste in my mouth after such a frustrating experience. 

I seriously doubt that this kind of thing is a regular occurrence for Culinary Dropout, but for whatever reason it was pretty bad that night. I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with some friends. I was pretty disappointed. There are virtually no vegetarian options on the menu. I ended up eating a provolone fondue appetizer (it was decent, but not a meal). However, my friends really enjoyed their food. They had a DJ playing music. It was way too loud. We couldn't carry on a conversation. As a result we have not returned to this restaurant. The prices for the food are really reasonable, and if you aren't a vegetarian than you will probably love the food here. Try going during the day to avoid the loud music."}
{"text":"Was a great addition to the area and we went over 30 times last year, so it must have been good.

Still with a visit, but it appears management made changes in December. For example, the pork belly nachos were an all-time favorite, but now use cheap tortilla chips instead of the kettle fried chips that made it special. It was also impossible to find any pork belly-everything was now shredded."}
{"text":"Good food, great enivorment for fun and great time!!  I don't usually  complain about the music, but it was very loud than most restaurants and seem to get louder at night went on, though this might have to due with being bac \"in the coop area\".  Downsize of the resturant, is  if you don't make a reservation on Saturday night you might have to wait serval hours.  That what happened to me.  I got there at 6pm and they said wouldn't  have a table open until 9:30pm.  So my suggestion if want eat there, make a reservation even just 2 people...it will safer."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place!! A hip, casual vibe that had equally cool service.  Nothing was a problem and the food was just plain yummy.  EVERYTHING was delicious!!! The grilled cheese sliders, ravioli, kale salad, fried chicken all were shared among six people and not a crumb was leftover.  Oddly, my favorite was the pretzel and cheese fondue.  It just matched my mood and tasted so good with my drink!  I want to go back during the day and enjoy the patio.  It seemed like the people watching during the day would be fantastic!  Lol See you soon and thanks for a great evening."}
{"text":"Love this place! The interior alone is worth checking out. We went for lunch yesterday & everything on the menu looked amazing. Wine & beer is super reasonably priced - riesling for $6? Not bad. 

I ordered the grilled cheese sliders with tomato & bacon with a side of fries. Perfect amount of food & really good. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on 01/13/17. Place was pretty empty. Service was good. We started with the pretzels as an app and they were very yummy. I had the Kale and Butternut Salad and it was great (I was trying to keep it lite food-wise). My biggest complaint are the cocktails. Their cocktail menu sounds inventive and exciting...now, they just need to add some alcohol to them. When we ordered our cocktails the waitress suggested ordering a double (because retrospectively she knew) for only $4 more. Even with the double we couldn't detect the slightest bit of alcohol. If I ever return to this place I will only order wine or beer, since they won't be able to water that down. I would have given two stars, but like I said the food was good and so was the service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a couple of items from the Happy Hour Menu during a one night stay at the Hard Rock.. The service at the bar was great, very friendly. Had the Pretzel Bites with Fondue and the Chopped Salad (both $6).. really good value. enjoyed a $3 Mug of Beer  to go with it. The portions were very generous and the taste was great. The restaurant has a cool but casual look to it. Enjoyed it very much overall!"}
{"text":"My first experience visiting and have heard of nothing but good things and a playground for adults! Since this was a lunch hour event I didn't get to partake in the extracurricular activities. At first the menu seemed overwhelming but I kept it simple and had a chicken turkey sandwich. The dropout classic mule had so many flavors of of agave and lime mixed with vodka. I will make sure to make my next visit for happy hour so I can get more playtime !"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I really like it! The atmosphere is AWESOME! I love the live music and all the activities in the yard area. My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE  is their PRETZEL BITES with fondue!! TO DIE FOR!! DELISH! plssssss try them! Lol"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to have a light lunch before Our travel. The lunch menu is short but has good selections. We started with the pretzel fondue appetizer. It was huge! You get 10 pretzel rolls and a crock of fondue served on a hot tray so the cheese stays warm. This was very tasty. Easily an appetizer for four. Next, we ordered an appetizer of Thai chili wings. They are served on a bed of coleslaw. Again, very tasty. The sauce is sweet with a little hint of heat. It was just the two of us so we didn't even make it to a sandwich or an entrée. But certainly the appetizer experience was very good.

Our server was very good. Professional, pleasant, and knew the menu very well. 

The place was quite noisy at lunch and I would anticipate it would be the same at dinner. So if you're looking for a quiet place to enjoy your meal this would not be it."}
{"text":"Love it! Great place we can bring our toddler to for great food. Nachos and fried chicken are a must try! But you cant really go wrong with anything. Have had David as our bar tender a few times and he is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Ordered steak and fries and got it cold, very disappointed. It's 115 degrees outside but yet I got a cold steak and fries. Not sure how that's possible but definitely better places in the area that serve hot food!"}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience during happy hour at the Culinary Dropout the other afternoon. Food was great and the service was amazing as well. We tried the watermelon sangria they have right now and it was amazing and very fresh. I got the meatloaf sandwich with no cheese and it was very tasty. My fried got the Smoked Salmon Bruschetta which she really enjoyed as well. We shared the chips and dip as well as the monkey bread for dessert and we were very satisfied! This was my first time at this location and I was very impressed. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time to Culinary Dropout, and it did not disappoint. I orders the Korean Style Ribeye Cap - it was well worth the splurge! Flavorful, a bit spicy, and fully delicious. I also tasted the Thai Chile Chicken wings, which had a great flavor (I wish they sold the coleslaw on them as a side in and of itself). The service was great (although less attentive as the night got busier). Great live music and atmosphere! A memorable meal and evening."}
{"text":"My brother and his wife were staying just up the road for a few days and invited me out for dinner, like I would ever turn down dinner. :)  So when I got to their hotel I brought up the monocle and saw a bunch of places in the Scottsdale waterfront and Southbridge.  The two that looked the most promising were Olive and Ivy and Culinary Dropout.  We found parking and decided to try CD.  Walking in we had a choice of an hour wait, the community tables or outside.  Even in 100° heat we chose outside and were rewarded by a cooled and shaded patio that was quiet enough to talk on.

We passed on the cheese platter and ordered entrees.  Two hits and an ok on the salmon plate.  I had the beef stroganof and even though I do better this was the best rendition I had ever purchased.  Service was good throughout the meal.  As we were catching up on 13 years of not seeing each other we were not pressed to leave even though there were people in line waiting on a Thursday evening.

Just as a note:  This was my first trip to a Sam Fox restaurant and even being a sort of chain it certainly would not stop me from trying another of his concepts."}
{"text":"This signature dish from Culinary Dropout was a solid version of everyone's favorite classic meal. The chicken was just how you'd like it, crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.

The batter was unlike anything I'd ever tasted. It had a sweetness to it from the honey drizzle. I prefer my fried chicken with a kick, so this isn't in my top fried chicken dishes but it may be for you! The sides were very good as well."}
{"text":"I don't care if these guys are culinary dropouts or not, they still know what they're doing!

Food: A pretty short menu but they have a little bit of everything. To start we had the Soft pretzels with provolone fondue. I'm not exaggerating when I say they have the BEST pretzels and cheese I've ever had since I've moved to AZ. We've tried Thirsty Lion's and AZ brewing Co. to name a couple but Culinary Dropouts wins. Not being biased in any way. It was just all around the best. SO ORDER THEM. 
We also got the Roasted salmon and Rainbow Trout. I was shocked that this land-locked Arizonian restaurant had such great fish dishes. Very moist, flaky, no residual fishy taste. Flavors danced in my mouth. I want to say their fish is fresh not frozen bc of the texture, but can't be 100% sure. 
For my beverage, the waiter suggested the Velvet Death, an absinthe drink, and it was yum. 
Finished off with Apple Monkey bread and ice cream for dessert and it was heaven. 

Prices: Appropriate but not out of this world 

Atmosphere: Phenomenal. Culinary Dropout successfully pulls off the romantic or even family dining experience inside while also providing a social, drinking game area outside without it even being tacky. Creative lighting plays such a huge factor in interior decorating and ambiance and this place does it right. Just feels...idk...good. The indoor live music that night was enjoyable. The outdoor drinking patio/social games area is fantastic for groups and is a wonderful way to meet new people. 

Service: Good. 

You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place and was really excited to try the food. 

My first impression was WOW! I loved the atmosphere and the look and feel of the restaurant. Seating is personal, comfortable and very nice.  The staff is awesome and never did I have to ask fo a refill or anything. My server knew the menu really well and was able to help us choose what we wanted to eat. 

Appetizer: the pretzels and cheese was AMAZING! Great portion for sharing win 3-4 people 

Dinner: honey fried chicken meal. I wasn't too impressed with this dish. Honestly they honey in the seasoning was a little strange for me and I love eating honey with my chicken strips but not so much blended in with he seasoning. The dish itself was filling and had three sides which included a biscuit, mashed potatoes and coleslaw ( I think  ) I cant really remember the last option. 


I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the deviled eggs! Other than that, tried the bacon bloody mary, it was good for a few seconds - until it started to taste TOO bacony. Idk, I didn't like it too much, I should have ordered a regular. But it was cool to try bacon infused vodka for once! Lol"}
{"text":"Where do I start. The food and service is more than five stars. Even when the place is packed the staff is super friendly and on par. We had the pork belly nachos which are absolutely out of this world, there are no precise words. The burger is one of the best I have ever had and the pours on their drinks are adequate. I look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"Another wonderful experience at a Fox restaurant! We usually go to the Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale, but last night decided to check out one of the other locations, and chose the one at The Yard in Phoenix. The band playing was fantastic, the staff happy, friendly and uplifting as always, the food mouthwatering exceptional, and my scotch pour was on par. Nothing is ever chincy or half done at any of the Fox restaurants we have gone to, and as a result have decided that Fridays are our Fox nights! In our conversation with the waiter and then the manager, we commented that everyone is always happy; everyone - the staff and costumers! It's also so wonderful watching management helping, the manager Ezekiel last night cleared the table for our waiter - an act of true leadership. We chose the French dip, potato chips and onion dip for our entree, which was out of this world perfection. The french roll was the perfect texture, not too dry, not too soft; the roast beef beautifully flavored and prepared; the au jus - wonderful beyond words. The confections at all of the Fox restaurants are consistently  magical delights that I suspect are conjured up by fairies incognito."}
{"text":"Great location. Okay food. Kinda overpriced."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We missed out by not going there sooner. I love the great eclectic ambiance. The food was perfect. I really enjoyed their \"living room\" style dining chairs -so comfortable!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the biggest restaurant I have ever been in. Tons of stuff going on and because it is next to the university their prices are amazingly cheap. I brought 10 staff members and everybody thoroughly enjoy their meals we actually all came back 2 days later to eat there again"}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out while vacationing, mainly because of the allure. I mean who wouldn't want to support some culinary drop outs. Although the decor was right up my alley, the food and service were not. I read countless rave reviews about the pretzel balls and fondue. Very disappointing to say the least. The cheese was comparable to warm canned spray cheese (Easy Cheese). We also opted for a create our own antipasto platter. Everything was overly salty, my tongue literally burns. Then....we stopped there. Even if we wanted to continue with our dinner order, it would not have been possible. Our waitress stopped three times. First to take our drink order; Others delivered the food we did order, second to take our food order and we flagged her down to bring our bill. The 2 stars are for the decor and vast drink menu. Don't waste your time or money eating here."}
{"text":"This place is located on the back of the Hard Rock Cafe Hotel. It's a bar/ place to get some drinks and food. It's a little pricey but the food is pretty good. When you are in here you can also look out onto the area where the Rehab parties are on Sunday nights"}
{"text":"Absolutely get the pretzels and cheese. Everything on their menu is delicious but I crave this appetizer they are so amazing."}
{"text":"I am giving three stars for the cheese plate. We ordered it and literally just got a plate of cheese. What am I supposed to do with cheese? No bread? No apples? It's has a great outdoor patio and the service is great but we came for the cheese and it's kinda lackluster"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The location is new, nice, and huge!  The pretzel bites are my favie appetizers there.  The waitress was pretty good and came around to make sure our drinks were filled.  Great place to meet up for HH!"}
{"text":"Ok, food is awesome good here.  We were sat in the patio area but it started to rain.  We moved to the bar patio area.  No problem.  We were enjoying and eating then BAM.  Someone is smoking and I have valley fever (made me have sensitive lungs), so I had a hard time breathing.  I thought most places were non-smoking?  Again, the food was fantastic.  The server was very sweet and super attentive.  Next time, I will make sure I am sitting inside of the establishment."}
{"text":"Second time here, I sat in the dining area last time and the band was so loud that I could not communicate with my dinning mates.  So we choose outside this time, it was on Halloween so it was cool to see all the costumes and everyone in the Halloween spirit.  But again the music was loud, we were screaming at each other to communicate.  I love the trend, relaxing feel.  The food is so good:  had the fried chicken (YUM).  This time I got the beef dip.  HELLO, it was shaved prime rib with au jus sauce and yummy fries.  Very moist and taste awesome.  The server was funny and very attentive."}
{"text":"Did not have bud light crown royal or fireball which are bar classics. Very Scottsdale crowd but yet they had their beers on special served in brown paper bags. Good seating and presentation. Good parking and off the main beaten path but still close to Mill Avenue. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Went here during a girls night out while visiting a friend.  It was a large restaurant and easily accommodated our party of 5 on a Saturday night.  There was no wait for a table.  The interior is kind of dark, and there was  a stage up front with a guy doing cover songs of all kinds of music from Micheal Jackson to Black Sabbath.  It sounds weird, but it was actually really fun and upbeat, lots of people in the restaurant were singing along. We were starving when we got there, so we ordered a few of appetizers to share.  

Pretzels and cheese- so delish.  the portion size was big and the cheese stays warm because it's served with a little candle under the dish.  the pretzels had a crisp exterior and were soft and fluffy in the middle.  the cheese was light and creamy and maybe kinda buttery tasting.
Pita bread and hummus- meh, nothing special
crusty bread, garlic oil and balsamic- pretty simple, it also came with some type of bruschetta on the side, but it was weird because it tasted like salsa so i didn't really care for it.

for my entree i ordered the grilled chicken club (because I wanted french fries)  it was really good and very meaty. it has chicken breast, ham and bacon. I was getting full  from all the appetizers that i ended up eating the inside of the sandwich and took off all of the bread.  it had a lot of flavor and the havarti cheese was a good balance with all of the meats.

The service was really good.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  I'd come back here."}
{"text":"This place had a really cool atmosphere. Food was delicious, the sweet corn raviolis were even better than I was hoping. Hoping to go back on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"The paradox between young and old. Young on the ASU side of town. Old over the railroad side of highrise corporate offices and suites. Placed under a open air metal roofed warehouse providing different focal areas - bar, dinner, bags & pong. 

Order from a broad beer menu - wine menu is limited. Appetizers are well defined - we started with Pretzel bread with Fondue dip. Wow.

Dinner was Turkey Corned Beef - ate every bit of this Sammy.  Fries and a cold local brew rounded it out.

Good vibe. Great staff. Modern feel. We will definitely he back with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The wait staff is quick and the atmosphere was perfect! I definitely suggest indulging in the pretzel bites! Thanks for having us!"}
{"text":"Talk about joke. No wonder this place is called \"Culinary Dropout.\"

It was my girlfriend's birthday and her choice to eat here. I came a little later than 8:30pm on a Sunday; and it wasn't too busy to handle our 12 person party. 

Already when I sat, I was greeted with my friends telling me not to order Hennessy and/or the oysters because \"they were out of it.\" Hmmm, ohhkaaay ---- I guess that ruled out those options.

I ordered a Moscow Mule and was saddened when it came in a regular glass cup. Sure, I would get a dollar off for bringing my own copper mug (as stated on their menu) but, who really carries around a copper mug. And if this place is gonna have 3+ assortments of \"mules\" then they need to have \"The Mug!\"

As we chit chatted, the waiter comes back to tell my roomie that the olives he ordered for his anti-pasti \"wasn't ready yet\" because \"it wasn't cured.\" --- what does that even mean --- My sassy 'tude was like, \"is it sick?\" My roomie said to just bring out the bread, sundried tomatoes, and balsamic. It was decent. Balsamic was sweeter than most I've had. In the end, it wasn't anything special.

My friend, who was sitting next to me, got the salmon entrée. And lemme tell you that his first reaction to the dish was priceless; almost jaw dropping awe lol 
His first words were: \"THIS was $25!\" (((Hence the picture/meme I have to go with this review))) The salmon was smaller than most salmon I've bought at the grocery store. It laid on less than handful of brown rice and veggies. My friend said: \"this would be the perfect dinner for someone on a diet -- too bad that aint me.\" Funny thing is this is what the waiter recommended as \"the best thing on the menu.\" 
My friend had to share his girlfriend's burger and fries to get even some fulfillment. **SHRUGS**

I shared the jambalaya with my roomie and that was spicy enough to my liking and even though the chicken, shrimp, and sausage jambalaya was mixed in with rice; our Asian asses still ordered a side of rice with it.
Other friends got the steak, meatloaf, curry, and prime rib dip sandwich. Everyone was pleased with their food but, in the end, it was nothing that stood out.

All the while we're eating, we were never filled with our water nor ordered more alcohol. It was just a less blah. 

Even their monkey bread dessert, which we were told could serve 4 ppl, COULD NOT serve 4 ppl. It was like bite sized cinnabon donut holes if they had that.


Our waiter was funny tho and did the best he could with what he had, I'm sure. 
Another thing I'm sure about is that I won't be back."}
{"text":"As always the culinary dropout has excellent food. We had the kale and strawberry salad off the new menu. Awesome then we share chicken club.  Nice light lunch .topped it off with a Wasatch \"apricot hefeweizen. Music from the pool. Great lunch experience."}
{"text":"My wife turned 29, and we went here for her birthday with the family and mind you we have 2 small children. There were no children in there at this time. Mostly professionals and dating couples. We went with another group to celebrate. Service was fast and flawless. Our waiter had a great grasp of the menu. The meatloaf was very tender and I was worried about the ketchup sauce being regular and bland but the flavor was very savory and had some kick to it. The fried chicken is very good and fried to perfection. You can tell they take pride in their fried chicken because the chicken tenders we ordered for the kids were juicy and not overcooked. My mother in law had the fish and chips and she kept raving about how fresh the Cole slaw tasted. There is live music, which can be a bit much if you don't like loud music. But being the blues fan that I am it was a great addition to the meal. We did not have to flag the waiter down at all her was on top of everything for our visit! Great ambience and we will be back! And please get the pretzels and fondue and the monkey bread!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great atmosphere, a little pricey and sometimes extended waits due to popularity. I would definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I was working at the Hard Rock Hotel for five days and ended up eating at almost every establishment there.

We had a celebratory cocktail party on the patio. They moved some of the furniture around to give us a private section. The waitresses were busy, but very nice.

I tried a few menu items (score out of 5):
-Meats (prosciutto, capicola, salumi) 4
-Vegetables & Snacks (roasted asparagus, cured olives, roasted beets) 3
-Cheeses (I don't know which ones.) 3
-Chicken Meatballs 1
-Pub Burger 3

There were a few others, but I didn't get a chance to try them. Overall, I would say this is the second best restaurant at the Hard Rock Hotel, but that isn't saying very much. I still recommend going to a better place at another hotel if you can."}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about Culinary Dropout over the years, so I was excited to finally try it on my recent trip to Tempe. The Tempe location is quite large and we almost went in a wrong entrance (it looked like perhaps this was the entrance for private events?). 

We had a reservation and were seated immediately, even though the restaurant was hopping on a Friday night. 

I had one of the \"copperless\" moscow mules. It's disappointing not to have the mug, but the drink was mixed to perfection and garnished with a piece of candied ginger (yum!).

We started with the roasted brussel sprouts. They were delicious, but they are served cold (which was fine, but they should call that out because we were confused!). We also had the truffled potato chips, which were great. Both of these are fairly small portions, but enough for some light bites before the entree.

We then split the fried chicken and the turkey pastrami. Our server even arranged to have the dishes split for us (wow!) so we didn't have to manage that. 

The fried chicken was alright, but I didn't bother to finish my half. The sides were great though. Honestly, I found the turkey pastrami on the pretzel roll to be the better entree.

We finished with the salted caramel custard, which was topped with caramel corn. Loved that!

Our server was awesome--friendly, gave his honest opinion on the dishes and helped us pick some great items. I'd definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for lunch 
Great drinks, Matt is best bartender in Vegas
Food is wonderful, everything is made fresh
Attention to detail in everything they do
The view is the best, very relaxing you look out over the pool at The Hard Rock"}
{"text":"We came in with a group of 14 and had a great experience! Our server, Nicole, was extremely accommodating. She was helpful with app and drink recommendations. When they were out of a main dish some of us ordered, she went above and beyond by getting the dish from Olive & Ivy so we could enjoy what we originally ordered. 

Food and drinks were also delicious and fresh. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent food! Great service! Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Definitely check this place out. Atmosphere is perfect. I got the shrimp and pork belly ramen Teddy got the fried chicken. We both loved our choices. Also got the pretzels and cheese fondue. Can sit there with that and a good glass of wine or beer and just have that. A must try!!!"}
{"text":"This place was good. There burgers are delicious and the fish was really good. It was a little loud for me. The waiters were amazing they kept filling up our glasses and let us take our time. The monkey bread was good. But overall I had a great time and would come back."}
{"text":"Awwee... Now you are talking!! This place is down the street where I live with the same atmosphere and ambiance than the one in Scottsdale and I do not have to drive all the way to snooty Scottsdale to see all that!! Yayyy!! =) Full bar!! =) The menus is not too bad, but nothing that you can say OMG! but I have to say the Beef Stroganoff is really good ( considering I rarely eat read meats). Do not waste your money on the fried chicken or the pretzel/cheese fondue... (overpriced and for the ones that now how to cook, me, we can make this way better). Live music on Fridays and Saturdays!! =) Oh! and it is the ONLY place in Arizona where I can find Pisco Sours! If you are South Americans, you know what I am talking about. Lovely place!! perfect for a date or for girls night out!! =)"}
{"text":"Loved the vibe, we went during a golfing tournament weekend so they were busy, but our server was super nice and quick. Love Love loved the food! I got the green chili stew and I had to save some for later it was amazing! Amazing live music and decor! Definitely would return to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Good food and beer selection. Atmosphere was very modern and alive.  Live music ping pong and cornhole is always a plus!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice.  Food is good.  Just think its a bit overpriced"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, a little loud inside but it was too hot to sit outside. We got the fried chicken and the nachos. Though the fried chicken was marked as a favorite, we found it to not be one of ours. The chicken was sweet instead of savory, something not mentioned in the menu. The white meat was so dry that we couldn't eat it. The nachos, though better than the chicken, was mostly cilantro. The pork was mostly fat that we had to throw away quite a few pieces, out of the very few given on the nachos. 
At least the drinks we had were good."}
{"text":"what did you say???

sorry, I couldn't hear you over the noise..."}
{"text":"I think this is a Hooters wannabe but with better food. The servers were scantily dressed with either low cut shirts or daisy dukes.  The food was just ok.  The pork cracklings were just as advertised- we shared the BBQ pork belly nachos- be prepared for lots of cheese sauce. The pork belly had decent flavor nor could have been crisped up a bit.  Had the Seared tuna salad.  It was a decent blending of flavors, but the tuna wasn't the quality I have been spoiled by in CA.  The wasabi peas were a nice touch though. Overall.  Probably a great place for young men to gather to eat a solid variety of bar food and enjoy the sights all the young ladies were putting on display.  Just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I had an excellent sandwich when I was here. It was a turkey pastrami, and I had to ask what it was since I hadn't heard of such a thing. Turns out it's turkey made with the pastrami seasoning. It was excellent. In general, things on the menu were a bit out of the ordinary. 

The fries were really good, too. They had a nice seasoning to them and were cooked well, which is something that seems harder for restaurants to do than I'd imagine.

Their beer selection is a bit meh, with most of the beers being pretty common mega-brews.

The ambiance seemed a bit \"hip\" or \"cool,\" but we were there when it was pretty empty. Looks like they have live music sometimes, and I'd imagine the place would be pretty loud."}
{"text":"Terrible venue.  We made reservations on a Monday evening for 11pm. Traffic on the strip was terrible so we called ahead letting them know we would be 5 minutes late.  We were told that the kitchen closed at 11.  We hung up and then called back and asked what she meant as we had a reservation at 11- how could the kitchen close?  The hostess then stated they would stay open for us because open table was wrong and shouldn't have given us an 11pm reservation but that they kept doing it. We arrived at precisely 11:10 and guess what?  Closed! So we tried to call- guess what? Closed and wouldn't pick up.
Avoid this place. Food may be good (I wouldn't know) but it is run by a crew of lying amateurs.
Pathetic.
Not worth the effort."}
{"text":"GREAT!  Ate here again last night and it was simply a wonderful experience.  Kirk was our server - warm, friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and offered great food suggestions.  One person had the Sweet Corn Cannelloni and highly recommended this entrée.  Another had the Grilled Cheese Sliders and raved about how delicious these were - not his Mom's grilled cheese for sure.  I selected the 36-Hour Pork Ribs - which were amazing, fall off the bone, finger-licking good (unique way they are prepared).  Of course, the pretzel balls and fondue are a 'must'.  THANKS for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken had a piece that was not fully cooked and bloody near the bone.  Fish and chips had a piece that was not fully cooked with runny batter in contact with the fish.  The pieces that were cooked were good. It wasn't busy so no idea why they rushed it out. Overall, just unimpressive food"}
{"text":"It is a MUST every time I am in town.  Good food, great ambiance, seating inside and out.  Very little wait, quick from the casino lobby to the hotel.

Honestly, you should go.   The prices are right, the variety has something for everyone and of course, get the \"beer in paper bag.\""}
{"text":"Fun place with great decor. We stopped one afternoon for drinks (yum!). The waitstaff was prompt and friendly. Made great suggestions. 
There was a band later that night that we stopped by for a bit to listen to. Really a fun crowd."}
{"text":"I've been here before and this place doesn't disappoint. Plenty of games, beer and food. With a relaxed atmosphere you are sure to have a good time."}
{"text":"A fun, loud happening place in Tempe! 

This place is huge, loud and happening! There are ping pong tables in the back, plus the bean bag toss game.  The place is always super packed with people, especially on a Thursday night or on  day of an ASU game. 

The service is pretty slow but they get the orders correct. 

Food is interesting and tasty.  Note that the cheese plate is just that - one slice of cheese! No bread unless you order it separately.  

The drinks are interesting and tasty."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch with some friends. I ordered the captain crunch french toast and we got some of the pretzel balls with cheese dip for the table. The pretzel balls were great. My french toast was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. The waitress wasn't very attentive and seemed hungover. The restaurant was a little loud which made it difficult for everyone at the table to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"I have been staying at the Hard Rock while in Vegas. First off, I love the environment and decor of this restaurant. I sat at the bar (since I am solo on this trip) and immediately ordered a craft beer. I went to the strip yesterday and paid 8.50 for craft beer so it was nice to find a decent menu here with beers for 5.50 to 6 bucks. Also, they have this paper bag thing that lets you get a can of beer for 2.95. I have only been in Vegas for a couple of days and that seems like a good deal to me (regardless of what the beer might be). 

I ordered for dinner the Italian grinder. It was good. I really enjoyed talking to my bartenders. I didn't ask for their names but both gentlemen were nice and willing to help me pick out a beer or a whiskey to sip. If you are at the Hard Rock, stop in the Culinary Drop out and Enjoy some live music, a couple of drinks and a good meal!"}
{"text":"I like the concept a indoor outdoor high end food meets bar food done in a rustic bar/ restaurant/ patio environment. We had the meat loaf, deviled eggs, the pretzels with cheese dip, fried chicken, and prosciutto. basically everything yelp talks about. I also Ordered a iced tea and some alcohol. The refills were fast and service was good. interesting crowd and a bit loud with a band playing. But this is Hard Rock. I think it could possibly be the best thing in Hard Rock these days."}
{"text":"Culinary dropout: first let me say southern fried chicken is absolute one of my favorites. I did my research & found that Culinary dropout is supposed to have the best fried chicken in Vegas
If this was the best KFC has no competitor. Chicken was not brine (too dry)  no seasoning!
Overlooked & Greasy.  Bad Bad Bad. Don't waste your time or money. Help? Does anyone know of really true southern fried chicken? I'm from Arkansas and I know good fried chicken. My mom made the best ever. Sorry I can't share it with everyone."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great place to hangout and have fun with friends. I used to coke to this place a lot, but once it became really popular I don't go as frequently. The BBQ is one of the best burgers I have ever had. It will fill you up. Their ramen and chicken and waffles are great too!"}
{"text":"The pretzels with cheese fondue are delicious. A little pricey but it's a great location."}
{"text":"Our party of nine had lunch here today for our Christmas celebration.

There were a few things that were missed during drink orders and meal service, but quickly remedied by our waitress. The service was good, especially considering there were many large parties in addition to ours.

Our table split a few appetizers - I tried only the soft pretzels with cheese fondue. Fantastic!

My lunch was fried chicken which included 3 smallish pieces of chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, cole slaw, and a biscuit. The coating on the chicken was hot and crispy with tender moist chicken inside. Yum. The potatoes were warmish but tasted great. I forgot to ask for no gravy, but it was okay (I'm not a fan of gravy). The cole slaw and buscuit were good too. The servings are generous - I ate about half of my meal.

Nice place for lunch for a group."}
{"text":"I didnt know what to expect since this place replaced Pink Taco. Pink Taco looked like a cross between the set of Nacho Libre and an Elks Lodge. Well CD kept the Elks Lodge part and married it with Z Gallerie and I like it.  The waitstaff kind look out of place though..they look like they work at a country bar? Their gear doesnt really match the decor. 

Besides that.. service was great and the food.. OMG. Ill be honest there wasn't a whole lot that really called out to me.. but what I ordered.. who cares what else was on the menu? Started with the pretzel fondue. Doughy deliciousness dipped in cheese and good cheese.. NOT nacho cheese. My guy is STILL raving about it 2 months later! Then I went for the Sweet Corn Canelloni and it was good. Im talking \"Last Meal\" good!

This place is worth checking out, without question!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Jenny, for the wonderful service and great smile the 3 hours we spent hanging out!!!! Matt was an excellent bartender with an Awesome Personalty!!!!! You made Sunday a Funday 100%!! Thank you and we will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the turkey pastrami sandwich on the pretzel bun. Outstanding. I ordered the cheese sauce to go on top. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a little date night here during spring training, during the week. On the weekend, this place has a big line & wait. We sat outside in large armchairs with a lower table. We weren't very hungry so we split the pretzel fondue appetizer and the Gorgonzola chicken salad. The salad was really good and awesome that they split it for us. But the pretzels were just okay, I am not quite sure why they are so popular. In my opinion the individual pretzel bites are too big, 3 bites, and they definitely needed the cheese for dipping. We did have a great server! All and all a fun place that would be a great date night but we did see a couple children in the restaurant at 8pm."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and got a nice corner booth in the outdoor patio area. We started with the capicola, beets and goat cheese, jalapeño corn bread and one of the white cheeses. For entrees we got the turkey pastrami, fried chicken and perogies. For dessert we got the banana cream pie and monkey bread. 

Overall, the stand out items for me were the beets and (whipped) goat cheese and turkey pastrami. The big disappointment was the fried chicken - it had no flavor, the mashed potatoes were like a purée and the biscuit was cold - so I'd skip this item."}
{"text":"Food was fantastically prepared. Big, filling portions and looked really good! I recommend the chicken sandwich or any of the burgers. They will fill you up.

Prices are normal- the regular for a casual American diner. Try the antipasto before ordering food. They are 1 oz, but good to munch on.

Drinks were delicious. Beautifully crafted and alcohol content was right on the money.

Service was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"A solid restaurant with consistent results.  Americana menu of of favorites such as fried chicken, meatloaf and fish and chips.  Eclectic selection of beers and mixed drinks,  live music some nights.  Atmosphere is energetic - feels a bit like one is dining at a cabaret."}
{"text":"Awesome food !   Great selection of beers and cold drinks !  Great selection of appetizers to share with a good cold beer .  Fantastic manager who takes pride in his service staff and it shows ! Friendly and professional  ! Will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"Cool and hip!

I love the decor and the patio is AWESOME.  There are Alice in Wonderland type chairs, couches, regular tables, fire pits, and a great view of the pool.  The patio is a great place to hang out for brunch in the daytime or drinks in the afternoon.

The food here has been delicious both times I have gone.  I got the ahi tuna salad the first time.  LOTS of avocado and the wasbai peas were a little kick of surprise.  The next time I went I got a sandwich (pastrami I think?) and it was on a pretzel roll.  I just remember the damn delicious pretzel roll.  They have this fondue that looks scrumptious, but I've never gotten it because I think I would just eat the cheese with a spoon and people might judge me for that, you know?

This is a really fun place that would be good for groups or a date.  Very trendy."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me this long to finally try this place! I have heard so many great things from friends! I wish I tried it sooner! I was so impressed with all the food! 
Currently being pregnant, I had to pass on alcoholic beverages, and my boyfriend isn't much of a drinker. But I can say the beverage menu looked fabulous and creative! So once I am able to drink I can't wait to try a hand-crafted cocktail! 
I really enjoyed the pretzels, as our server recommended them since it was our first time in. There were SO many pretzels, and definitely can be shared with a group! They were delicious, fluffy and the cheese fondue was amazing!! 
Then we also had a variety of meats, cheeses and snacks from the antipasti menu! They were delicious and very filling! I let our server pick what we got because we love to just try new things! He was spot on and the meats and cheese were perfect! So if you are unsure, the servers are great with recommendations!

I was a little worried that we wouldn't be able to watch the football games since we are avid with fantasy football, but they had several TV's and the DJ was playing fun easy going music for a Sunday morning! 
I can't wait to come back to this place again!"}

{"text":"This place could easily become one of my favorite Vegas spots.  I had no idea this place even existed.  My cousin, who lives here; suggested it. 

The food and waitstaff are great.  The ambiance is pretty good as well.  We ordered the pretzels and I had the Shrimp and Pork Belly Ramen.  

The pretzels are ridiculously good.  And they stayed soft throughout our meal.  The fondue that comes with it is just the right amount of cheesy.  Flavorful but not so strong that it kills your taste buds.  

I can't say enough about the Ramen.  It was very delicious.  The pork belly was not chewy and I was sad when I had no more left in the bowl.  It was seasoned well.  I just wanted more!  

It was a great meal.  Now that I know about it, it might be a Vegas staple for me."}
{"text":"First time here and loved it.  The staff was super nice and the food was bomb.  I recommend the pretzel appetizer and fried chicken.  The drinks are good and the games make It an exciting Friday night or chill weekday after work."}
{"text":"The pretzel balls are really delicious plain, not sure they need to be dunked in such a mild cheese as provolone fondue.  I guess the cheese makes me feel better about spending $12 on pretzel balls.  The fried chicken came out super fast while some guy strummed Pink Floyd on an acoustic guitar.  Fortunately, the quick delivery of my chicken stopped me from filling up on pretzels."}
{"text":"Woooow, first off our server was excellent. I wish I could remember his name. I had the house smoked salmon and it was sooooooo good! I did also get the freshly made cracklings which were delicious, but the cook was a lil heavy handed with the spice blend. I also had the jalepeno lemonada, which was spicy and tart.....soooooo yummy! Then to top it off our server treated us to the banana cream pie!!! (I rarely eat desserts especially banana ones) but this pie was heaven!! I can't wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"Yes! I live in out of town now but will be returning every time I'm in Scottsdale/PHX area. We ordered pretzel/provolone fondue- pretzel fresh and amazingly chewy! Prime Rib Dip, Turkey Rueben, Sweet Potato & Kale salad - everything was so delicious! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Located inside Hard Rock Hotel, food was ok, service was pretty good. Large portions."}
{"text":"Since we tried this out for the first time we have been hooked. Their food is unique and always on point. The pretzels with provolone fondue is ridiculously delicious and is so addictive I have to get it every time. The iberico ham is worth the MP as it is the most delicious cured meat you will ever eat. The reason for my missing star is because of the four times we've dined, twice we had awesome service and twice it was slow and impersonal. Fortunately the most recent times were the excellent service so maybe they're picking it up. Either way, this is now definitely on our circulation of regular favorites."}
{"text":"Visited on a Tuesday, sat at the bar, and had a great margarita.  The water  tasted like it came from the canal, and apparently a new water filter is on it's way...better hurry.  I had the fried chicken, and it was lightly drizzled with honey, and quite delicious.   I also had the pretzel fondue and that was quite tasty too!  The decor is quite hip, the bar area would have been nice to have high top tables for the times you want to have a cocktail and mingle standing, and that is not an option.  Sit at a table or the bar...those are your options!"}
{"text":"Don't even get me started on the shrimp kale salad. I will crave that salad ! The pretzel bites are fantastic to share. They have pimento cheese as an option to add to your board ! Staff is always great, their style too. I take everyone from out of town to this spot."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last time I stayed at the Hard Rock and had a great time. I really liked the seating area and how it was laid out. Big open area with large tables for groups and small intimate tables on the outer edges for the one on one dates. Bar seating is also available and is pretty lively. I saw a little stage set up for a small band - looked cool.

Ok now for the best part - FOOOOD! So many things looked good on the menu. I ultimately went for the nachos. I am a sucker for nachos if they are described as loaded with toppings - yes pork belly was a eye catcher. While in the midst of getting my drank on it was a wise choice. Well they came thru - the nachos were excellent. Loaded with slow BBQ pork, black beans, guac, pico and a pretty interesting cheese sauce. The plate was large too - totally a entree on its own. Very flavorful and evenly mixed toppings, I wasn't left with a pile of chips after. 

I was also eyeing the fried chicken, it was touted as a restaurant fav. Luckily it was ordered at our table too and I was able to get a bite. Woah yes this was very good too. Again no shortage on flavor. Seemed pressure cooked with a crunch. Huge sized pieces along with mashed potatoes and gravy and coleslaw. A real BBQ picnic style plate here. A bit greasy but it is fried chicken after all. The meat is really tender and savory. A biscuit was also brought along side and that even was down right good. 

Oh and a friend ordered the roasted brussels sprouts. Ehh I wasn't looking for this tonight but glad I gave them a try. They would probably make someone who didn't like brussels sprouts actually like them. They were really good.

I was completely stuffed by the end of the meal and as far as I am concerned they nailed it with the nachos and fried chicken. Our waitress was great and took good care of our group. If I stay at the Hard Rock I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is the only place in town that should be permitted to sell Pretzel Fondue. Their bartenders are great. My favorite drinks are the After School Special and their Old Fashion. 
For food, I love the Turkey Pastrami Sandwich, the Muscles, Fried Chicken or the Gorgonzola Chx Salad."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not your ordinary menu and don't go here looking for the same things you can get anywhere. The atmosphere is so chic and cool...the servers and hostesses were all so friendly and helped everyone whether they were your server or not. Paisley was our server and he made sure had everything. He was so warm and sweet! Answered any questions we had about the menu and was quick with the service"}
{"text":"Had a less than Stellar experience, but the professional management made up for it. I'm confident what we experienced was simply due to an off night. Ezekiel was genuinely passionate about making sure we left happy and most importantly, will be returning for a second go around."}
{"text":"Amazing food, awesome customer service, great vibe.

Our waitress, Hend, made our meal 100% better. She had the best customer service, made us feel very welcome, and really made our night. When I come back to Vegas, I will be calling ahead to figure out when she is working and to make sure I can get a table in her section.

The food was delicious and was exactly what we wanted. Thank you Culinary Dropout for giving us a great food and great experience!"}
{"text":"I like the decor, service from our waitress was good, (not so much for the table next to us) , and the menu had some great sounding dishes on it. Now for the food. Ok so THE PRETZEL WITH PROVOLONE CHEESE IS A MUST. The pretzels were a perfect golden brown with a nice crisp outside and warm and soft in the middle, and the cheese was so good. I think it was my favorite pretzel I have ever had. And I get pretzels and cheese everywhere cause I love them. I ordered the trout with green beans. The green beans were great the fish was OK. The sauce that came with the fish was a little weak in flavor otherwise it was good. The fish was cooked perfectly for sure but again little more seasoning for me. My girlfriend got the Cannelloni and butternut squash. We all shared a little bit so we could try everything and I have to say the Cannelloni was excellent. I liked it better then the fish for sure but it was equally as good to what my brother got. He ordered the pasta with short ribs in a tomato cream sauce. Meat was a little fatty but omg it was tender. The only thing bad about this is there were beans in it that were over cooked so it made the dish a little grainy. But overall the dish tasted great. We liked everything so much. I have heard a lot of good and bad things about this place but we were happy with everything and we will come back to see if they are consist ant. I say give it a try. Its weird cause they have a lot of TVs there so I'm not sure if they are trying to be a sports bar or what. Either way it was good!"}
{"text":"If you sit at the bar, the service is 5 star worthy.  If you sit at a table, good luck getting any service ever.  My three star review is the average experience we've had so far at Culinary Dropout.  

The facility is fantastic.  They have some of the hippest bathrooms I've ever seen.  I want that grey geometric tile in my bathroom at home.  The sangria, especially the red, goes down way too easy, so we make sure we come by for happy hour.  I love the spicy thai wings and the peanut slaw they sit on top of.  It's a great place to watch a game or just hang out with friends and talk.  The Happy Hour is one of the best in Tempe.

On our most recent visit, we were ignored for 30 minutes while our server seemed to be stolen from the area by a huge table on the patio outside.  No one else came to check on us or ask us if we'd like to order food.  We eventually flagged a random server down to get our check.  That experience left a bad taste in our mouths that I hope will never be repeated."}
{"text":"This was a cool place. My aunt and uncle are h-u-g-e advocates of any Fox restaurant  and have been to the Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale. They were surprised at the decor and lack of an employee dress code compared to the Scottsdale location. I loved the hipster-y vibe and outdoor games! Perhaps no employee dress code because they've recently opened? We weren't sure. Some of the outfits we saw servers wearing we'd hardly call appropriate for a nice restaurant like Culinary Dropout. 
My family had reservations, so there was no wait once I arrived. We were seated in the main area with cool wooden tables. The metal chairs were cool but not comfy - my cousin and I were sad we didn't get the comfy-looking floral-patterned chairs. 
Service could have been better - our girl was hit or miss with us - I saw her pay more attention to her other tables. It kind of was one of those nights where we saw her when we needed to order drinks/food, and then once they were delivered. 
The food was amazing! Pretzel roll balls and the cheese sauce were great, ordered per my aunt and uncle. Everyone enjoyed their food, but the portion sizing seemed a bit off, comparing pricing/portion for my Ramen bowl to my mom's entree. 
Overall cool place but some kinks should be worked out."}
{"text":"Why, why, why come to Scottsdale on vacay and eat in a PF Changs or some other chain you have at home? I don't get it. There's a PF's on the same block as Dropout and the choice should be clear. Even though Culinary Dropout is part of the mega Fox Restaurant Concepts group, it is unique and definitely worth a try.

Everyone has said it, but I'll say it again: pretzel and fondue ... uh, yeah! Get it, dip it, love it. 

The prime rib dip sandwich (there's a dipping theme going on here, isn't there?) was terrific, too ... great quality prime rib. House made pickled peppers were perfectly pungent ... not sure if Peter Piper picked them. 

Located at Scottsdale's Fashion Plaza, this is a fun place to land after you've shopped in the ubiquitous megastores and are ready for something truly uncommon."}
{"text":"This place is great, spacious, nice staff, good food.
The beef jerky was delicious, as was the deviled eggs which are the best I've ever had. The Gorgonzola salad was delicious but skimped majorly on Gorgonzola and I think smoked almonds are gross. 
The Marcona almonds were standard. The monkey bread was good just not as buttery as in the Midwest."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to hangout, but $10 for a drink called, \"Room Service\", that comes in what looks like a Barbie sized champagne glass...seriously, come on guys. Rip off."}
{"text":"So....ordered some food to pick up today for lunch. Ordered the Pub Burger, a Gorgonzola Chicken Salad and the Caramel Corn to split with a co-worker. Food was great. My issue is with....value. Here are my thoughts when looking at our lunch items individually. 

Pub Burger: It is a simple, well constructed burger with a great flavor profile. Thick cut bacon, havarti cheese and barbeque sauce. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium. It was on a pretzel roll which really complimented it well.  At $12 including fries...a solid A for me. 

Gorgonzola Chicken Salad:  Chicken, Gorgonzola, butter lettuce, radicchio, arugula,
fennel, smoked almond, and tart cherries. So here's the deal....the salad was delicious. But....if Gorgonzola is the first word in the name of the salad, I expect to see more than three dime sized pieces of Gorgonzola in it. Didn't see any smoked almonds either. And at $13 for a salad...I think that I should.  Value? No more than a C.  Maybe ordering a salad to go isn't such a great idea.

House Popped Caramel Corn: I LOVE caramel corn! But, at $4 for two cups I expect more. More corn. Taking the time to cover the corn with caramel more evenly. And how about making some effort to remove the unpopped kernels before you put the caramel on? We had 6 or more unpopped kernels in our two cup order. That is just lazy. Value? D-

So I will definitely try this place again....but I will order a burger and lower my expectations."}
{"text":"Live music. Great food.  Great drinks. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the service. It was so busy and loud the night I went that they could barely keep up. Yummy yummy yummy!"}
{"text":"We were out in AZ for my brother's graduation, which meant he got to pick the place to celebrate.  He recommended Culinary Dropout for our large group (2 other families celebrating with us).  The cliff notes version is he chose wisely.

We sampled nearly all the apps.  The deviled eggs were simple, but probably my favorite.  We split the grilled cheese sliders as well.  A few of us enjoyed the special kale salad they had, while the rest went large with the either the pub burger or pastrami.  The salads came in good portions and were full of flavor.  Those going with the sandwiches didn't leave anything on their plates.

Of course, we also enjoyed a few drinks.  Some seemed a bit pricy, but they came quick and it was a day to celebrate.  I tried the After School Special beer cocktail and was happy with my choice.

Once the meal was complete, a few of us stuck around to play some games and enjoy the atmosphere.  I could see myself frequenting this place if I lived in the area.  Therefore, from a tourist perspective, I say go for a visit."}
{"text":"Natasha is a fantastic server! We sat outside and ordered from the Antipasta menu. She gave great recommendations on the food and drinks. For my friends first time to Culinary Dropout- I am happy they had such a great experience! Thanks Natasha!"}
{"text":"This place is unique! The ambiance is amazing and the food was delicious. The servers and wait staff is super friendly and outgoing. Came here on a Monday night and it was more chill and laid back, which was what I was going for. We ordered some appetizers; bbq nachos- they were so delicious and lots of food, I'm talking a mound of nachos! The pretzel fondue is a must-do, warm and cheesy at its finest! To finish off the night we ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun, I feel like I would have liked this more had I asked for no mustard vinaigrette but hey next time I know! My friend said her M.A.C. burger was delicious and just what she was looking for. Will most definitely be returning, probably on a weekend to see what it has to offer then!"}
{"text":"Very small portions. Food looks NOTHING like pics. Lifeless presentation. Oh yeah, and they'll add or subtract whatever ingredients they want to whatever you order...so you won't get food exactly as described on menu. And staff/management simply does not care."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  We were there to watch a free concert by Roger Clyne and got a front row table. Tori did a pretty good job.  The place was packed so we had to wait from time to time for drink refills but the bar was really busy so that's understandable.  The only real downside was that there were employees who would whistle extremely loud throughout the night.  I guess it was some sort of signaling system to get each others attention. (otherwise it would be 5 stars all the way)  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I just love this spot. The glazed beats are to die for! I'm also a huge fan of the drinks. The green drink with jalepeno is my fav and the summer peach comes in 2nd. It comes with a home made candied peach that is just heavenly. For entrees I like the kale salad and tuna salad. Their menu has a good range of options from burgers and hummus to healthy salads so it's a good place for groups with differing tastes."}
{"text":"This place didn't do much for me.  We stopped in here before the Rascal Flatts concert at the Joint on Friday and the bartender who served us had the personality of a dead animal.  You could clearly tell that she didn't want to be there.  Part of the experience at a pub or restaurant is the staff and how they interact and she failed miserably.  It's a good thing that I didn't ask her what she thought about any specific wine because I doubt that she would have been able to answer my question but she was able to pour a Grey Goose & Red Bull so she gets a star for that extremely difficult drink(sarcasm groan inserted here).    

I would recommend sitting at the bar here if you don't talk, hate people and want to be left alone.  If that's your jam then have at it."}
{"text":"Great food drinks and atmosphere. Perfect for a large group. A favorite in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place, but the server fit the bill as a dropout! We ordered a charcuterie plate and received it with no bread; trying to get the bread was, no kidding, a half hour process, with asking more than one server. Don't get me wrong, I understand when things come up, but our server pretty much admitted she forgot to order the bread.
But the best thing we ordered was the provolone fondue. I can still taste it, it was to die for! It comes with pretzel bites, but any bread will do. If you are ever there, please do yourself a favor and order the provolone fondue!
The shrimp and pork belly ramen is a must try too.
I would like to say I want to go back, but the service really did me in!"}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I would. First before we went to the restaurant we checked to see if we should reserve a spot but the entire day was open so we decided we where just going to go. When we got there, there were two girls at the front desk staring at an iPad. When I walked in they didn't say anything I had to start the conversation. When I said we had 4 she said there was no room and a fourth five minute wait (but from what I could see there where at least 40 spots open) so We waited like ten minutes and we're going to instead go to the Salty or thirsty Lion and as we where walking out the door they said they had a table ready. We didn't take it and went to the other spot and it was amazing. So good and excellent service. I would never go to culinary drop out again"}
{"text":"Had the chance to check Culinary Dropout w/ some co workers & their spouses and this place was excellent. The vibe was great, they had something for everyone (single or not) ....definitely will be going back, but I'm going to valet the car this time Haha."}
{"text":"We went to CD foe our anniversary. At first we were overwhelmed with the loud music. Louder than appropriate for dining. But we grew accustomed to it. It was a live singer and it was more like being in a nightclub than a restaurant. The food was easy going and tasty. The pretzels were large and delicious and the cheese sauce was tasty. I had the steak which was tasty but tepid and my husband had the turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll which was a house favorite and he loved it. The service was attentive and it was a fun evening. Just one or two decibels less on the music."}
{"text":"Our waitress Danielle had been working since 10am (she told us) so she couldn't wait to get off her shift.  She brought us the check so we didn't get a chance to order dessert.  Good thing my fat ass doesn't need it. Then repeated nagged us to sign our check. 

Fried chicken was weirdly sweet and very dry.  Ribs were good and so were some of the drinks but not good enough to offset the terrible service."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner before meeting up with friends in The Yard.  The whole staff was very helpful.  I eat gluten free due to a health issue, and our server walked me through the GF options on happy hour menu. We didn't make it past that because once I saw their nachos were GF, I was decided.  I asked if the fries my husband ordered were cooked in a designated fryer.  I was told his weren't, but they do have a designated fryer for cooking gluten free fries!!

They have a decent hard cider offering.  I tried the prickly pear, which was pretty good.

Later when trying to figure out if a certain liquor used in one of their cocktails was GF, the server was very helpful in helping me identify the specific manufacturer and liquor so I could google.

Everyone went above and beyond what I expected.  It was a great experience."}
{"text":"Had High Expectations that barely were met. 

The word gastropub is becoming dirty in Las Vegas.  Culinary Dropout gave me a perspective on how to abuse this title.  Not a HUGE (Cheesecake Factory/Grand Luxe-esque) but Vegas appropriately broad selection of dishes.  

The space that restaurant consumes makes it feel like a hanger with a dynamic inside-outside transition that shows off the beauty of the HRH pools.

That's where everything went downhill...

The service was Vegas nice, the music was Hard Rock music and despite GnR beginning their residency, I was expecting a larger rush at the CD.  

The antipasti which we ordered came approximately 3.5 minutes to my buddy and mine's entrees being served.  All of which were at room temperature...no bueno.

No bueno on a few folds...cured meats at room temperature are very strange (to me) at room temperature.  Add a bistro steak ordered Medium Rare, SERVED Rare, and at room temperature is also distressing, the only reason I didn't send it back was the flavors from the gastrique and Gorgonzola and my supreme hunger level at that time.

My buddy had mixed views of his Pork Cubano.

There were highs and lows, but right now plans for a return visit."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I decided to come here for happy hour and I really enjoyed it. When you first pull up it can be a little intimidating because there aren't any empty spots to park in, but luckily they have complementary valet and those guys are really nice and do a great job taking care of your car. I went in to get a table (very spacious -- loved that) and they told me it would be an hour wait and at first I was hesitant on staying and I'm glad I did because I was seated within 10-15 minutes of my arrival. If you decide you want to wait outside (as I did) they will text your phone when your table is ready. I had the cheese sliders and fries and they are soooo good! I also played it safe with the cocktails and ordered vodka and cranberry juice which was made to perfection. Everything went well with the exception of our waitress shorting me $10 on my change, but I quickly forgave her for the mistake (I hope it was a mistake). A lot of the people there (you college aged) were casual and some were really dressed up (a little older working class) and I felt so underdressed because I had scrubs on (came straight from work). I was able to get sliders, fries, and two cocktails for only $20 during happy hour... Not too bad! I highly recommend this place for a girls night or a group outing."}
{"text":"The service, food, and ambiance was excellent. Came on a Friday night with live music, sat outside in a really comfortable chair, and the waiter was so chill. I got the Gorgonzola salad, which was perfect. The chicken noodle soup was very tasty, and the pretzel bites were so soft and yummy. Branden got the prime rib dip sandwich and loved it. I also had the jalapeño cilantro mule drink which I loved. However, I've only been here once. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of this place after my first visit this past Saturday night! We had a few drinks at the bar then played some shuffleboard. The bartender recommended a Moscow mule which definitely hit the spot. The drinks were a bit pricey but that's typical for this area! The atmosphere was great out in the patio/The Yard. I gave this place 3 stars due to closing at 12pm. Really?! It was still packed and everyone was enjoying themselves playing the yard games. Also, we got there about 9 and couldn't find parking. Valet was full and they have signs stating you will get a ticket if you park on the street. We ended up going to a bar down the street for an hour or so since we couldn't park there. I'm glad we gave it a second drive by and got parking at 10:30pm because we had a great time until it suddenly closed at 12."}
{"text":"The wait here is INSANE even just on a Thursday night. We waited for like an hour and a half. Once we got in we received great service and food. I'll definitely get a reservation next time. The French Dip is awesome. I asked for a side of their horseradish cream sauce, and it made it even better! Gotta get the soft pretzels and cheese...plus my favorite mule, the dropout classic. It comes with candied ginger and is just really tasty. I love the aesthetic of the restaurant and the games outside (when it's cool). Awesome concept."}
{"text":"I'll just confirm for everyone that it's called Culinary Dropout because the food isn't very good, not because it is inventive in any way. I think when they were hiring they also found a Music School dropout because the \"live entertainment\" was the worst I have ever seen; I'm actually pretty sure the girl was lip syncing. 

I did have a good time and the food was okay however, this was nothing I'd ever want to experience again, especially for the prices they charge. $22 for average fried chicken, one biscuit, and freezing cold mashed potatoes? I could do better at Church's Chicken.

My wife had the trout, she said it was good but also agreed it wasn't worth the price and the wait. We were in the restaurant for about an hour and a half and it was just two of us, no drinks and no apps and all while having to endure the horrible singing."}
{"text":"Well, let me say that THE YARD is GREAT!!  Also, the pretzel bites and cheese fondue!!  But as far as the other food I've had at the Culinary Dropout, well the chef must have really been a dropout.  Fried Chicken: REALLY greasy. Ribs: taken out of a pre-sealed plastic.  Meatloaf: REALLY dry and just awful! Green beans: Cold and under-cooked.  I just go now for the drinks and pretzels"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pretzel bites with cheese sauce, they were definitely delicious. I chose the grilled cheese sliders and had a side of homemade chips and onion dip, both pretty good. Our waitress was nice. I liked this restaurant overall and have no complaints about the restaurant, but it didn't seem super extraordinary to me, just another restaurant. 

Also, I was kind of confused about where to park. There was a sign that said complimentary valet. Seeing as there were no more spaces left on the street to park, we used the valet services. But since it said \"complimentary,\" does that mean you give a tip??? Kind of confusing...And we felt so bad because we had no idea there would be a valet and we had no cash on us for tip. Sorry guys :("}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and service! Great date place or hangout with friends. Had the room service to drink and turkey pastrami to eat. Both were yummy!"}
{"text":"This was my fist time at the Tempe location.  We had no trouble reserving a table through RoundTable and everything was ready for us when we arrived despite the place being quite busy.  The food came out quickly, we had a pretzel appetizer - delicious!  My kale salad was out of this world (it is hard to get excited about a salad, but this one makes me want to go back for more.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their entrees.  I did not have any brews, but I heard good feedback.  The prices seem to be very much in line.  Plenty of parking available.  Will be back for more, for sure!"}
{"text":"Good food cool hipster atmosphere with a cool staff. Only reason not giving 5 stars is b/c the menus has literally one heathly thing on the menu. I split the chicken club with fries and washed it down with a Bloody Mary. Both good and the pretzel balls appetizer is worth a try. Overall a good place just plan on running an extra mile to work it all of :)"}
{"text":"Loud, obnoxious, overpriced, confusing...  The best way I can describe another attempt at this place. I will not be back.  Parking is a nightmare and valet filled up again. This place is well below the many other options in north central Phoenix. They appear to have tried a party place as an infill but it has flopped badly.  For a good time try Postinos, Windsor or Federal Pizza.  WAY more classy than this central phoenix wanna-be party joint."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. Me and my bf had burgers. However, that salted caramel custard was to die for. We should have ordered two because I did not want to share. Will be back."}
{"text":"I got their fried chicken, my boyfriend got their yesterday's soup and ribs that was cooked for 12 or 24 hrs - can't remember. The fried chicken was okay, I expected it to be more flavorful but it was lightly seasoned. It just tasted like a reg. Friend chicken olace. I did like the mashed potatoes. Although the chicken breasts wasn't too dry, the thigh is always the juiciest so I only ate that part. My boyfriend's rib was amazing, it was wayyy good and the fries too. I didn't try his soup but he said it was really good. Overall,  I really like this place. I'd love to visit again and try more of their dishes. The atmosphere is comfy and outside they have heaters to keep you warm. The place is very beautiful, I think their food overall is amazing. My other 2 friends order looked like they really enjoyed it since it was all gone. It was the steak something and salman salad. Their first time there they said a waitress wasn't friendly, but this time the waitress we had was alot more nicer and friendlier so we gave her a really big tip! Last meal in Phoenix was great."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to lunch while visiting the Phoenix area, although located in Scottsdale.  It's not too far of a drive for great food.  They really deserve 4.5 Stars, but it could be just that I prefer my food seasoned more.

Their menu is diversified, ingredients fresh, servers and kitchen accommodating, the vibe is hip and open.  My son ordered the huge, over-the-top yummy rack of Jalapeño Ribs, which didn't seem too spicy.  They were meaty, tender, moist and flavorful.  That's what I'm ordering my next visit!  I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken that was lightly drizzled with Honey, served with Mashed Potatoes, Biscuit and I added a side of Brussel Sprouts.  The Sprouts are served cold, which I felt did not compliment their flavor.  The waiter was kind enough to heat them, but they were still slightly warm.  The Chicken could have benefited from a bit more seasoning, although it was tender and moist.  My husband ordered the Mac Burger, which he said was quite tasty.  They do have supreme French Fries and I'm not easily impressed with Fries.

All in all, the food was so good that we didn't even mind the the slow service from a first day wait staff who did one terrific job, considering he was so new.  He was friendly and had great personality.  Culinary Drop is our Scottsdale go-to that never lets us down."}
{"text":"The food is great.  The drinks are tasty and they have a ton of games that you can play while you hang out.  I am a big fan of the pretzels with dipping sauces.  It's great to play corn hole and just chill with friends."}
{"text":"The happy our menu is a little misleading as the grilled cheese doesnt come with bacon as mentioned in the reg menu.
My husband comes here for the fried chicken.
I dont like that you can see into the mens bathroom through the womens bathroom."}
{"text":"The service and food was good but it was hard to understand the menu like nothing was in English (it wasn't Spanish either but too trendy) and waitress wasn't very helpful and she was impatient for that matter. This is one of those places that I should visit multiple times to understand types of food they offer.
We eventually ordered Antipasti which was tasty, small and pricey."}
{"text":"Customer service great. A bit of a wait, but sweet and perky staff.
A little hard to hear, with music being quite loud. Overall, the ambiance is comfortable and relaxing. 

Food is superb. I get grilled chicken on pretzel bun with fries every time. Not stingy with the chicken and the ranch is TO DIE FOR.

I DO NOT like cheese with my pretzels, but the cheese sauce that comes with the pretzel bites appetizer is just such a beautiful harmony of flavors in my mouth. 

My sister got the fried chicken and said it was the best ever. Moist and well seasoned. 

They did have a blueberry cider beer when we went months ago, not sure if they still have it. But, it was really good.

DESSERT: Salted caramel custard with homemade caramel popcorn. It is life. It is just perfect and beautiful and fulfilling and ..... just RIGHT! It is the best dessert I've had in Las Vegas. If I could eat this every night I would. When I come here I get dessert there and 1...sometimes 2 to go!"}
{"text":"Really nice staff (hosts, servers, bartenders, and security). Food was delicious as always, drink menu is fun to choose from too! You must order the pretzel and provolone cheese fondue!! I had the seared ahi tuna salad (incredible) and my boyfriend had the MAC burger (so indulgent.) The \"Room Service\" cocktail is so good! Our server was so nice and attentive and the atmosphere is great. We went on a Thursday around 8/9pm and there was a live dj up on the stage re-mixing popular songs, they sounded pretty awesome. Gorgeous, huge geometric light fixtures, tufted leather benches/couches, and the outside Yard area is beautiful - complete with a bar, shuffleboard, pink pong, and cornhole! 

The Yard is a fantastic area for larger groups to enjoy drinks, order food, play games, and hangout. We live literally across the street from Culinary (Tempe) and have been anxiously watching the building process and awaiting it's opening. We were not disappointed! I would absolutely recommend Culinary Dropout Tempe to anyone!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. I have wanted to come her for a long time.   I had the Turkey pastrami and Adam had the barbecue hamburger.  Yum!  So worth the wait.  But the cherry on the top of the Ice cream sundae  was our server, Victoria!! She spoiled us.  She gave us wonderful recommendations and even surprised adam with a fun drink called the pistols at dawn!  Get it !"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars, and I'm just not excited enough about what I ate for my main course to move this up to 4 stars.

Fun, open atmosphere, friendly and helpful service, decent food.

After walking in through a seemingly endless hallway (with an admittedly nice view into the kitchen), I arrived in the main area of Culinary Dropout. I immediately liked the setting, from the openness of all of it to the modern tables. I don't think the smaller tables with the pub-style seating looked very comfortable, so I'm glad I didn't sit there. I was with a large group, and despite that, the service was always quick and attentive.

We had a few appetizers to start. The BBQ pork belly nachos were delicious--guacamole, black beans, some tender and saucy chicken, and a few other toppings were all on there. The soft pretzels and provolone fondue were pretty tasty as well.

I ordered the shrimp and pork belly ramen. I had reservations about ordering the ramen, but I had been craving ramen for a while, and this was the opportunity I had to have some. The waiter convinced me it was delicious, so I went with it. When it came out, I was sure that he had been right. Everything in the bowl looked great! The pork belly looked awesome, the cilantro, mushrooms, and sprouts were nice and fresh, the shrimp looked tasty, and the soft-boiled egg was delightfully tempting. I was hoping for a slightly larger bowl, but it looked great.

Once I started eating, though, I just wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong, the ramen wasn't bad. It just wasn't all that great. The pork belly was cooked nicely, and the soft-boiled egg was perfect--nice and runny inside. But it was all rather bland. There wasn't much flavor to any of it. It was pretty \"meh\" to me.

Now the reason I added half a star and was tempted to add a full star came at the end of the meal. The bourbon black bottom pie. It's ridiculous. The chocolate ganache is fantastic, and the graham cracker crust adds a lovely texture. But what really did it was the salted caramel sauce that is on the side. Oh, man, this is good pie!

If it was all about the pie, this could be 5 stars. But my disappointment with the blandness of the ramen required a lower rating. Maybe a subsequent visit will convince me to bring up the rating."}
{"text":"Large space, laid back vibe. We arrived for some informal dinner and ordered a variety of different drinks and foods. All their specialty cocktails were yummy, I got a greyhound and when I told our waiter it was tasting a little watered down/light he didnt hesitate to make it better (read stronger). SWe go the chacutuerie plate, I liked the roasted tomates that we ordered but none of the meat or cheese stood out to me. Also shared the fried chicken which had a sweet sauce on it, not a fan of that. The mashed potatoes were good though. Jambalyaya was OK, tasted more like cajun flavored fried rice because the texture of the rice wasn't as sticky as I imagined Jambalaya to be. Overall a fun place to hang out but I wasn't wowed by the food."}
{"text":"The food was okay. We had the pretzels and cheese..the cheese didn't have much flavor. We also ordered the BBQ pork nachos...they were pretty good despite small bones in the pork. The service to get our food to go and pay was very slow."}
{"text":"Great food with okay service 
The drink menu has great drinks and is very creative. Worth it. The service is okay at best."}
{"text":"great atmostphere on the patio...could have jusst lived on the chips and dip...Salmon had a great flavor...nice touch wiht the pouched egg...service ok...they tend to  get lost....this is third visit...will go back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is really good. The customer service is spectacular. 
Overall nothing bad to say about this business. I really mean that."}
{"text":"My man companion and I were staying across the street at Serene. We decided to come here and yes, we were rip roaring drunk but I really think this may have been the best meal of my life.  I am glad I live in Vegas because I am going back sober!  

We started off with (we wanted everything btw) crusty bread with olive and balsamic. To die for. We had dolce Gorgonzola.  At first I was like $6.00 for two small square slices?  It was worth it. I'd pay $6.00 for one. We decided to also split pierogis with crispy Brussels sprouts. Melted in your mouth.  We wanted a bowl of the Brussels sprouts. Mustard creme friache that it came on was amazing.  

I got the fish and chips.  Soooo good. It practically melted in your mouth as well. I was going to get the grilled cheese sliders but it looks like those no longer exist.  I also wanted the strawberry Brie and pistachio which shows online on the menu but also no longer exists.  My companion got a sandwich.  I hardly ever eat all the fries on a plate but they were super tasty! I am glad I got the fish.

Anyway we're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Vegas. Craft brews, delicious snacks and sammies. Our sever Dana was great and her manager was quite thankful for us taking Mo-vember photos to support men's cancer awareness. WILL BE BACK. 

No photos because we inhaled everything."}
{"text":"I walked into Culinary Dropout for a quick lunch before heading to the strip to walk and enjoy the beautiful weather. 

I had a turkey pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun with french fries :-). Everything about my meal was delicious. I didn't want to leave anything on my plate!!

My server was awesome. He was efficient and kind to this single female sitting in his section.

Loved the fact that the restaurant is directly by the pool. They do have a section of tables outside with fire pits, but it was closed during the day due to wind (which is the reason for the missing star -- if I asked, and there is a server present, you should let me sit outside).

There is another location in Phoenix, but I don't know if it is as good! :-)"}
{"text":"food is great. but the whiskey selection is what really stood out to me! found a new favorite whiskey there with the help of a very knowledgeable waitress"}
{"text":"We need to give this place another go.  We went for breakfast and on the first NFL Sunday of the season, so I'll be honest, it was not the fairest of days to critique the place.  

I had the Fritatta and my fiancee had the Two Eggs Any Way.  I want to go back and give the pretzel bites a go (seeing as how they seem to have received rave reviews).  

Pros:
- Our waitress was very nice and took great care of us
- the food wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad either!  
- Attached to \"The Yard\" which looks like a BLAST to hand out in.  If we had more time we would have been all over one of those ping pong tables.

Cons:
- Loud atmosphere, but again football Sunday...rowdy crowd ;)
- Mandatory valet parking - I have valet parking my car...I have no good reason, just don't like it and don't love being forced to do it 

Overall: B+  can't wait to go again and chow on pretzel bites with dip"}
{"text":"So excited that I got to try this place. Just moved to Phoenix from socal in January and when I saw this place in Scottsdale, I thought it looked cool and wanted to try it out. I live near the Biltmore and saw there was one in Phoenix while browsing Yelp and so I wanted to try it out ASAP! Hubby and I went for happy hour and we were beyond impressed. For as nice a restaurant it is, and for such high quality, the happy hour prices were beyond exceptional. Drinks no more than 5 bucks and food no more than 6. Hubby and I got only the happy hour specials, I must say the pork belly nachos were phenomenal. This might sound odd, but the best part were the chips! They tasted house made. My husband totally agreed too. Everything was cool. Loved the atmosphere. We'll be back and can't wait to bring friends!"}
{"text":"I loved this whole scene. It very much reminded me of The Block, Brewster's and Lagunitas in Petaluma. The food was really, really good. We tried the pretzel bites with cheese dips, the burgers, a chopped salad with cous cous and a menu item called yesterday's soup. Which was a great add to a menu. It was the day before soup of the day at a lower price. You don't often see that. 
The service was spot on and we really enjoyed the experience. Oh and the artisan cocktails were really good and a hefty beer and wine list."}
{"text":"I think Culinary Dropout deserves 4 stars because of the food. Every time I have been there the food as been exceptional! The drinks are also very good and creative; you won't see these drinks anywhere else! 
There's a few things I dislike about this place. They are ALWAYS crazy busy so if you don't want to wait 50 minutes for a table you should come during \"off hours.\" The music is very loud and I have to yell at my server to place an order, its also hard to have a conversation with anyone. Finally, every time I have come here, it takes a surprisingly long time for any of the hosts at the host stand to acknowledge me. There are 2 hosts there and they will always be talking amongst themselves or staring off pretending to be doing something. Meanwhile, a line of people forms at the stand. I don't know why but it usually takes 5-10 minutes for the host to say hi or \"we will be right with you\" to me, and that bothers me.
All in all, I return for the food but I'm not a fan of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing! I was in the area for work and wanted a relaxing, but delicious place to eat. Food and atmosphere were fantastic! We enjoyed much of the food- highlights were the pretzel bite fondue, Korean Beef tips and the fried chicken.  If you only have one night out- go here!"}
{"text":"This place was beyond cool. Geared toward the young adult crowd. This place is a gastropub with occasional live music, a great menu, and awesome decor. They have these leather couch benches that extend the length of the entire restaurant. 

The food was delicious. Culinary dropout of not, this chef knows what's up!

The corn, avocado, kale, and beet salad was one of the best salads I have ever eaten. I added a piece of roasted salmon and it was cooked to perfection. The portions are huge and I was flying home the next day, otherwise I would have taken mine home to eat again.

We did not order the pretzel and cheese dip, but we saw it brought out to a bunch of tables and it looked really good.

They also have really interesting cocktails, of their own creation. I had this cider drink with lemon flavor and something else added. I wish I knew the name because I would order this a million times over. The also offer a surprise beer in a brown bag for $1.95. Too cute. It is actual served in a brown bag, but it happened to be a Milwaukee brew.

We had a small issue with the bill not matching the menu price, but that was corrected once we brought it to their attention. This cost them a star because if we hadn't noticed then they would have up charged us.

We had a great meal and incredible drinks here. This is a great spot for groups or even a date night."}
{"text":"Cool ambience, okay food. I had there bbq pork nachos and maybe because I'm Latina but in my opinion bbq and nachos don't mix. I may give it a second chance and try something different since it was my first time there."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Vegas! The fried chicken entree is to die for. It was so good I had to recommend to the couple next to me. The service is fabulous and the overall feel of the restaurant atmosphere is great. There is outdoor seating which would be great when it's not so hot out."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this - walking in the giant tunnel was a little weird, but made sense once you got into the space

Couple decent beers and enjoyed the food - nothing crazy on the menu, but enjoyed my prime rib sandwich."}
{"text":"TEMPE, AZ: Came in today for some Culinary Dropout fare and was impressed!  The room is busy, the waitstaff was knowledgeable, the food was good.  They have a game area in the back and bring in live music as well.

We tried the Pretzels (4 stars), like big, salty, bready, soft doughnut holes.  The dipping cheese fondue was excellent.

Also enjoyed the charcuterie plate (4.5 stars); had the prosciutto, goat cheese, and fig bar.  It was delicious as well.  Great place, excited to return and try more!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. The location is awesome! Lots of open space and a great decor and the service was outstanding. There is a more limited menu for brunch and there were a lack of vegetarian options (especially since they were out of the pierogis) but I got a breakfast sandwich sans meat. It was a decent meal but what I really loved were the drink options! 

I feel that the vibe of the location and the fun and delicious drinks more than made up for my lack of enthusiasm towards the food and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"First timer... Had the seared tuna salad with a Gin and Tonic cocktail. It was a great first visit. Loved the atmosphere and people were nice.  Food and Drink was great! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow. My new favorite spot. The Fried Chicken is fab!! (Our server called it comfort food, hahaha!!) So is the canolli. Just make sure you tell them to ditch the mushrooms if that's not your thing. They don't tell you that on the menu!!

Great drink names, too, although I don't think some are up to my \"taste\" standards!! I didn't end up drinking it but hey, they have Malibu Rum so I am okay with it. 

A live band plays a few days a week so tune in for that. And plan for a late night :)

I think since it just opened in January, they are working kinks out so bear with some of the service \"issues.\" The company I've been with, the several times I've already dined there, have kept me completely engaged so I don't think I've had to wait long. If I have, oh well. Just gave me more time to enjoy the conversation and views :)"}
{"text":"OMG, I love this placw. Their pretzels and fondue are the best I've come across period. You don't need to order anything else, just get yourself the pretzels and fondue and life will be great!"}
{"text":"Tovah, our server, was fantastic. She was extremely attentive, helpful, energetic, and very quick to get things done. I ordered the salmon entree and asked her if butter was used in preparing the dish. She said that she would be sure to let the chef know to omit butter. She even went out of her way to come back and let me know that some of the chefs may choose to use butter, so to request no butter on future visits. I was really impressed by this attention to detail. I was also equally impressed by Ryan P., the bartender. He was also extremely helpful, professional, and had great energy. The service was top notch and made for a very warm, welcoming environment. I will be back and recommend to friends! It's such a great spot. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Big space, I hit it early , during happy hour,  $3 draught beers.  I love hand cut fries, they have these on the menu and they are just ok.  I suspect that a person in the back feeds them to a machine., better than super processed for sure.  I also ordered the Thai wings, the wings were just ok for the wing snob, but OMG I could have eaten 5 pounds of the slaw, cashews, sesame, lime amazing - I will try to reproduce it.  Service at the bar was both great an not particularly attentive, especially given how busy it was, not very.  I may be high maintenance,  though I wouldn't have guessed so.  All said I would come back, bring friends."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for the first time tonight and we were not disappointed. Our waitress, Sky, was fantastic. Thanks for a great dining experience! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We had the soft pretzel bites and the soiled dove beverage. Our server was very friendly and the decor is like a Gastro pub(very on trend)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  Came here after shopping with my mom and wanted to try some place new within Fashion Square Mall.  Our hostess was awesome!  We wanted patio seating with a heater...it was cold in the shade and she made it happen.  

Our server was awesome too she was very helpful and answered all our questions as this was our 1st visit.  We started with drinks and then she suggested appetizers -chips with their onion dip.  AWESOME!  They were delicious.  We decide to split the chicken salad and she warned us it had mayo ....classic chicken salad.  Glad she mentioned that.  We also ordered the soup of the day which was \"yesterdays\" soup and it was excellent.  

The staff was awesome and the food was great.  We both enjoyed our chips, salad and soup along with our wines.  The whole experience was great!  Yes...I would come here again."}
{"text":"We went during happy hour, got pretzels & fondue  and pork belly nachos, both of which were delicious and came with so much food! Then we had the fried chicken which was also delicious (the honey drizzle made it!). I loved the ambiance of the place. Great location and decor!"}
{"text":"My first impression of Culinary Dropout is how much style and creativity went into the restaurant itself.  Albeit a little hard to find at first (it's tucked away near the train tracks west of Mill Ave), this place has one of the most beautiful, laid-back interiors I've seen in awhile.  In what looks to be a warehouse that was seriously remodeled, they have enough space to fit a stage for live bands, a full alcohol bar, and a plethora of seats and tables.  Speaking of live bands, they have live bands playing on the weekends, even during lunch hours!  The music was at a perfect volume: loud enough to enjoy, but quiet enough to be able to hold a conversation at your table.  Very, very nice touch of entertainment to an already good-vibes kinda place.

My friend and I both ordered the Fried Chicken, which they are supposed to be well-known for.  Even as a Texan of 1.5 years now, I have to say, this fried chicken did NOT disappoint!  You get about three pieces of fried chicken (a drumstick, a breast, and a leg), cole slaw, a buttery biscuit, and some mashed potatoes & gravy.  All 4 were seriously on point and complemented each other perfectly.  The cole slaw in particular was quite the heavenly surprise.  Some of the white meat in my chicken leg was a little bit dry, but it was otherwise extremely and superbly well done.

Unfortunately, I did not try any of the beverages or appetizers on the menu, but it's just one of many more reasons to come back.  Four and a half stars in my book, and will probably see star #5 after my next visit.  If you're anywhere in the Phoenix Area, this place is a must visit."}
{"text":"Best mashed potatoes I have ever had. Only remark I would make was that the service was ok. Food was delicious though!"}
{"text":"The happy hour was amazing. The place is very cool but not trying too hard. The staff was friendly. 

Had grilled cheese sliders, shrimp pot stickers and a salad. Along with 4 mix drinks. It was around $40. The bar is a lot of fun. 

I can't wait to go back for a full meal."}
{"text":"I had the Korean style ribeye cap and it was excellent! The meat was very tender and cooked perfectly, crisp fresh vegetables and well balanced flavors all around. I would definitely recommend this dish. And the drinks... so good! I had the gin & tonic #33, pistols at dawn and the miss margaret. I'm a sucker for craft cocktails and they definitely delivered. If I stay at the Hard Rock again this restaurant will be at the top of my list to visit."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here, lounge sofas and chairs, beautiful patio with string lights, shuffleboard, ping pong, and bags while still keeping a classy environment. Full bar and amazing waitstaff! 

I tried the pretzel fondue and it was delicious! With higher prices you receive a fair amount of food!"}
{"text":"Food is terrific. (SHAVED PRIME RIB DIP w/ Au jus!!!) Drinks are great. Service staff is very nice.

Atmosphere is superb. Open feel, space between tables, nice bar in the back with games area (table shuffleboard, ping-pong, corn hole, etc) between seated dining and bar, with outdoor (but still in door) seating near games area.

You won't be disappointed no matter if your \"thing\" is the food, or the drinks, or the atmosphere, or the service, or whatever."}
{"text":"Never ever, ever again.  Three strikes and you are out!! Great food and atmosphere, but the service is beyond terrible.  They comped us... Again....  That isn't the point though, their customer service is consistently terrible, and the managers recognize it and don't deny it.  It was very nice of them, but this place is a disaster!! Food is awesome and we will continue to go to the culinary dropout in Scottsdale, but we are finished with Tempe! Understaffed and they straight up do not care!!"}
{"text":"Strongly recommend this place, very nice people and good atmosphere/environment to hangout with family and friends. The food is okay, no thing special, even their fried chicken (2 stars from the house) but tbh it's just like KFC lol. But a kickback was their thai chicken wings for appetizer, very delicious. Love everything overall!"}
{"text":"Do not...I mean DO NOT plan a party here. We just had a work party for 100 people and for over 4K dollars, they didn't even want to provide a table for the buffet food. They ran out of food after about 10 people in line and the refilling was spotty and inconsistent! For that money, we don't even have our own spacious mingle. Utter disappointment. After asking for the to bring dessert, half our group had left as dessert came out AFTER our event was over. For the money go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"First of all, happy hour that you can get in the dining room.  

Second, they have an $8 ($6 during happy hour) mystery drink special of a beer and a shot.  They bring you random stuff, and I am surely about that.  

The place is decorated very well and I appreciated the atmosphere,  even down to the tables and chairs.  

The food was AWESOME!  We had the pretzel bread and cheese for an appetizer and it was totally incredible, then we had meatloaf sandwiches which were equally as impressive.   We concluded the meal with house made carmel corn that was as fresh as it was tasty.  Absolutely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout NEVER disappoints. We'll definitely be back again...and again. So good."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, drinks and food. The cheese fondue appetizers was phenomenal. Come for the food, stay for the surroundings."}
{"text":"Love the burger at this place!! Couple locations all filled with awesome staff and atmosphere.. Also one of the best Moscow Mules :)"}
{"text":"My meal was wonderful but my daughters not so much the chicken was over cooked but the did try to replace, it just took to long so we declined and they made an adjustment to the bill.  I had talked the chicken up so it was disappointing to have it happen on there first visit!!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the amazing service Tyler and joe!!! Truly awesome celebratory time!!! Ps.... Desmond's smile is on point"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable price and good atmosphere. If you're looking for an mid-range, casual and hip dining experience in Vegas, check this place out. The copperless mules on the drink menu are a must. The chips and dip on the appetizers are a can't miss! Everything was good, even down to the perfectly roasted brussel sprouts. It's a bit on the loud side on the inside but if it's a nice day, be sure to head out to the large patio to relax with a cocktail. Good option for gluten-free diets as well."}
{"text":"We enjoyed good food and good service at Culinary Dropout, but wished they could invest is some lights so you could read the menu!  We, and every table around us, used their phone to read the menu.  This level of darkness at a restaurant is ridiculous.  

On to the food.  Everything was delicious! 

Starters: Soft pretzels w/ provolone fondue $12.  OMG, this creamy, velvety fondue is one of the best liquid cheese creations I have ever had.  I could eat it everyday.
Cheap House Salad $6.  This was just okay.  No taste complaints, but the 'buttermilk ranch' was not really evident.

Drinks: Between You & Me: Belvedere, grapefruit, cranberry, and lemon.  Very refreshing and a little tarte.  Enjoyed.  The BF had a beer on tap- can't remember which, but it was nice and cold the way he likes his beer.

Main course: Ma...the Meatloaf!?! $18. Served with green beans and mashed potatoes with gravy.  This one took me back to grade school.  I could have sworn that my grandmother was back there making this meal.  If you want 'comfort food' with a homemade taste, this is the dish for you.  

Fried Chicken $22 served with mashed potatoes and gravy, cole slaw, and a buttermilk biscuit.  Really good chicken.  Super crispy golden exterior, juicy flavorful chicken inside.  Same tasty potatoes, and the cole slaw was a bit bland.

Desserts: Bourbon Black Bottom Pie $7 and Salted Caramel Custard $8.  The pie and the custard were both too rich for us, but the salted caramel corn that comes on top of the custard was like crack!  We could have eaten a movie theater bucket of that stuff!"}
{"text":"Sat us down . Waited 15 minutes and walked out . No one asked me for a drink or if we needed help .  Never again"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is a regular visit for us.  Fun vibe, unique twist on food and pretty good value. Tonight I enjoyed the Fried Chicken.  Super tasty and I will get it again for sure.  For an app, strongly recommend the kettle chips and their French Onion dip."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Even though the place was packed the server was very friendly and attentive. Food was delicious! Roasted corn ravioli for the win!"}
{"text":"I came on a Tuesday night & it was packed. The service was quick & friendly & the food was very good. Loved their nachos & the steak tacos."}
{"text":"I am an extremely huge advocate for how amazing culinary dropout is. However, this location needs to take a few pointers from the other two locations. I didn't even get a chance to sit down in this restaurant before being treated like trash by their hostesses. The four airhead hostesses that you had working tonight need to learn their job before being sent out into the world of restaurant hostessing. 

I've been a hostess. Your job is just that. To host and to be the first and last impression that your guests  have of your establishment. It's not hard to at least pretend to care about your customers.

Now that I've had my rant, let me tell you about my 2 minute experience that left a sour taste in my mouth about this particular culinary dropout location. 

Upon walking into the establishment the hostesses just stared and didn't even greet us with a simple, \"hello\". My boyfriend had to stand there for several moments before they acknowledged him. He told them how many it would be (it was going to be 4) and the hostesses, upon him asking how long the wait would be, responded \"I literally don't even know right now.\" And we just looked at them. Then they go further on to say, \"all of the tables we have for the rest of the night are going to reservations, but you can sit on the patio at an open high top.\" She also told us that one had just freed up and that we could have it. So, without even offering to show us the way, sends us out to look for the open table that supposedly exists. We go out there, no open high top. We walk back to the hostess stand and say to the girl that there are no open tables. She just replies, \"oh, sorry. You can sit at one of the couches on the patio.. But it's not full menu.\"

Oh. Thank you. I didn't come here to eat dinner. (Sarcasm).

When we tell them that we have no where to sit because we want to eat dinner, they again, blankly stare at us and respond with a less than sincere \"sorry.\"

My boyfriend is not patient and tells them we are leaving because they are refusing to even offer to help us find a table. Again, less than sincere, \"sorry\" as we walked out. 

I understand that it is New Year's Eve and that you have a lot of people to accommodate, but your hostesses, instead of standing there at the host stand, clumped together, should be out doing everything they can to try and accommodate ALL of the guests who want to dine in your restaurant. (That includes bussing tables, walking the floor to find open tables, or find almost finished tables). I've been a hostess and a waitress and these girls did not know anything about customer service in the food industry. And even if you can't seat me tonight, at least try and act sympathetic and show me that you're doing everything in your power to treat your customers well. Otherwise you're going to continue to lose customers to Postino right down the road.

Again, I love culinary dropout as you can probably tell by my previous reviews of the other two locations, but this one needs some work. The other two locations have customer service down to a science."}
{"text":"In my top 10 restaurants of all time. Hands down.

I've made several ventures to this establishment starting about 3 years ago with my best friend, Andrea. Since then I have tried a decent amount of items on the menu. I have NEVER been disappointed. 

Meatloaf: the thing everyone hates when their parent's tell them it's what's for dinner. Not the case if you've ever ordered Ma? The Meatloaf! at CD. The meatloaf has got to be the thing I order most frequently. It's moist and is served with Mashed potatoes and greens. I am in love. 

Aside from my love affair with the meatloaf, I could ramble on all day about all of the other amazing dishes Culinary Dropout has to offer. (Especially those pretzels with fondue). 

The aesthetics of the restaurant are incredible as well. I love the big chandeliers with the eclectic furniture all while being mixed with a wooden-topped bar. It's absolutely gorgeous and perfect for a date, hanging out with friends & family, or even a business meeting. The best part is their dress code is casual. 

The wait-staff is always pleasant. Always willing to suggest entrees to new guests (like my parents just the other night) and are very attentive. I like the fact that they can pretty much wear whatever they want to wear to work in as well. 

I have to say, I am not surprised at the quality and perfection that goes into this restaurant, considering Fox Concepts has always hit home runs with my taste buds."}
{"text":"Food is decent, not nearly worth what you pay. When i went, my guest and I both received food that seemed like it had sat for a while, it wasnt cold, but didnt seem fresh either. our waitress never came by to refill drinks and overall just seemed preoccupied elsewhere. However, once we asked for the check, she seemed to check in with us much more frequent, of course."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is one of those places that just doesn't live up to the expectations that it sets. From the outside, one would imagine that it's probably a pub-type place. Lots of bar food, great happy hour, etc. It's even super dark on the inside with dark woods, black chandeliers and a stage for a band, giving it a Scottsdale chic, but semi-dive type of feel. But the menu just leaves me scratching my head wondering where the heck it came from.

For starters, the appetizer list is relatively short and un-appetizer like, especially for a place that seems to be paying homage to bar food. Note: French onion soup should not and does not qualify as an appetizer, nor does \"Yesterday's Soup.\" Other options included oysters and mussels--two other dishes that seem out of place for the \"pub\" disguise. There was a long list of cheeses and meats, but that also seemed out of place for a pub. Perhaps I'd appreciate that selection had I been at a wine bar?

Alas, I was able to find two items on the menu that seemed to correlate with the atmosphere--pretzels and fish & chips. The soft pretzels and provolone fondue appetizer is very delicious, as you'd expect any bread and cheese combination to be. The pretzels were small, soft bites and the fondue reminded me of Velveeta, but less salty. The fish & chips, were was pretty much exactly what you'd expect for fish & chips out at a pub. Thin cut fries, cole slaw, tartar sause, crispy fish fillets. Nothing special, but not bad.

Frankly, I don't understand why the place is so dang popular. It was packed with Scottsdale nightlife, so it makes me wonder if most people come for the bar and to say that they're partying at the Scottsdale \"Waterfront.\" I probably wouldn't go back there, unless I had a real hankering for some pretzels and cheese."}
{"text":"Visited during Restaurant Week.  Dinner for two.. we needed the reservations and it still took 25 min waiting for a table. The atmosphere was very upbeat. We had drinks while we waited for a table. Nice selection of beverages. The food and service were excellent. We ordered the meatloaf and the honey-drizzled fried chicken. Both plates came with more trample sides and all of it was delicious. Although the restaurant was really noisy, it was still a comfortable atmosphere. Definitely a place I want to visit on a week night to compare the experience to a Saturday night.."}
{"text":"I love the look of this place.  I think I was more entranced by the decor than my meal.  But, that could have been my own fault for getting a salad and not trying one of their other tasty options.  The Smoked Chicken Salad was good, but a little lackluster.  The dolce gorgonzola was the saving grace (or should it be saving taste?).  We also tried the Soft Pretzel and Provolone Fondue, which was very very good.  I am anxious to go back there and try some of their incredible sounding drinks!"}
{"text":"Culinary dropout: great atmosphere and really fun cocktails! The food was solid, with a decadent twist on a gastropub menu. We couldn't decide what to get when we came into town last week... so got the deviled eggs, pork cracklins, pork belly nachos and a kale salad. Best of all worlds in a single meal. They were also extremely accommodating with making liquor and other substitutions for my gluten free diet. Deviled eggs were perfectly executed with just a hint of vinegary tang. The nachos were yummy, but I definitely think their game would be upped with shredded cheese instead of the velveeta cheese. All in all a really fun experience. I'll be back when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience. We selected Culinary Dropout because we've had so many good experiences here. My husband's boss was in town with his family - our job was to find a fun spot to go for lunch on a Sunday with kids - Culinary Dropout seems perfect. 

We were a table of 9 - 4 adults and 5 kids. Management wouldn't move us inside (except to a high top, which doesn't work for small children), even though the outdoor area was literally BAKING under the metal roof. They didn't offer to move us if we waited 15, 45, 120 minutes ... nope, they literally just said no. It wasn't just the hostesses - there was a manager at the host stand too.

When our server finally comes along we order drinks - drinks take forever. She told us \"I'm just rolling with it today - the bartender is new and keeps losing tickets. I hope you get your drinks soon\". REALLY? Drinks sit empty on the table for no less than 20 minutes. Server comes by to see if drinks have arrived, we report that they haven't (as evidenced by empty glasses on the table) and she says ok, and wanders off to another table (not to the BAR where she could OBTAIN the drinks from). 

Then the food takes forever. Icing on the cake: they fail to deliver the boss' wife's salad with the rest of the food. We alert many employees to the problem. Server comes back to the table and says \"that's weird, they have it marked off as delivered\" and then wanders around aimlessly - doing nothing about the missing salad. We lose sight of her for a bit, and she comes back 10 minutes later and says the kitchen is remaking it. All the adult food is cold at this point, because we're waiting for the salad to be delivered before we start eating. Another 10 minutes go by - still no salad. Server comes over and says the kitchen is still working on it. It's a freakin salad with salmon - how long could it possibly take to make? Manager finally delivers salad, w/server trailing closely behind him. Manager offers a muttered apology, says he will \"take care of the salad\" and says he will come back around in a few minutes to check on us. Of course he doesn't. I've never had such apathetic service in my life.

PS - Forced valet sucks."}
{"text":"Pretzel bites and the yard are my favorite parts of this place! It's also huge! A lot of work parties and double dates! 

I recently went on a double date here-this place is perfect for any date occasion or meeting up with friends. The outside area is so entertaining we love all the games. 

I strongly suggest trying the pretzel bites. Beware it comes with a basket full. I'm talking like 15 of them and they are not small. The cheese it comes with is white and they warm it with a candle. So yummy!! 

After we all shared the pretzel bites and crusty bread (also yummy) we were basically full so my bf and I decided to split the Club sand which. We both liked it and they brought it to us on two separate plates cut perfectly in half with separate fries. Very accommodating!  

Great food! Great fun!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and live music Sunday night.  $2 beer in a bag all day Sunday. Fun spot."}
{"text":"i have been to this place a few times, generally have had a good experience but my most recent visit wasn't good.  I knew we were in for trouble when I asked the server how we fix our wobbly table and she just shrugged her shoulder and walked away.  Our night didn't get any better from there. Very poor service, food came out cold, my mussels didn't taste right and the server didn't bother to address the issue.   They took way too long to clear the table and get us our check.  And we weren't alone, the table next to us was complaining of the same things.  Just a general lack of concern and care for our experience.  I certainly hope this was just a one off rather than a once great place becoming a victim of its own success.  May give them another chance down the road, but if I do it will be the last one."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout in downtown Tempe is definitely the place to be if you are up to a spendy happy hour or spendy lunch. It's quite pricey for what it is, probably going to run you about $20-25 for a lunch and drink and we went for happy hour and it was about $85, nothing happy about that. HOWEVER, it has a great ambiance to it (industrial decor) and it's definitely a younger crowd - college age. They have cornhole and some other games in the yard. It is an outside eatery so it will be too hot to be there during summer months. I'd highly recommend the pretzel and cheese appetizer, delish! Other than that, not worth the money. It is very much a bar so do everyone a favor and don't bring your kids....that is, if they're even allowed."}
{"text":"We came in mid day on a Sunday. The staff was friendly, but it did take awhile for them to figure out where to seat our group of eight.   The server was great and made some yummy recommendations. The fried chicken is a must. It was so tender and moist. The pretzel and cheese appetizer was a nice starter to our meal. Fun atmosphere. Very limited kids menu and not a lot of choices on tap. Place to try at least once."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place a lot more.  It was sort of dead (Sunday).  Menu is interesting but a little weird.  My buddies had the fried chicken and raved about it.  The burger I had was basic.  Nothing special.
Beer menu is lacking.  Lots of basic beers but nothing really special.  
An annoying thing is that the bathroom is outside the restaurant down the hall in the casino.  Very poor planning.  Overall, not terribly impressed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favorite gem off of the main strip in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock. The staff is incredible and if you have dined here it feels like a home away from home. The level of detail every waiter, chef and bartender go to make customers satisfied is incredible! They have great salads, appetizers, burgers and more. I love their seasonal specials the best. Come for the food, stay for the experience."}
{"text":"I went here for my most recent birthday and thought it was delicious! I am a big fan of the Fox restaurants, and I really dug the vibe of this one. It's casual brew pub meets fine dining and that is right up my alley. The location is perfect. There were chandeliers on the ceiling yet we had dish rags to place in our laps for napkins. Funny. I liked knowing that everything on the menu would be less than 20 dollars, so it wouldn't break the bank too. I highly recommend that anybody try the pretzel fondue. It was SO good. My boyfriend and I really liked the furniture, it seemed like it was straight out of an old hotel or something. It was cool. I tried the clown punch, it was tasty and a really good price! A lot of people complain of a wait to get in, but we were seated in less than 5 minutes on a Saturday night, so I can't say we had any problems with that at all. Way to go Sam Fox, this restaurant is a winner! :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good food overall and a unique atmosphere as well. This place is HUGE and set up well for groups or for those wanting to just catching a game. They also have live entertainment which was enjoyable to listen to as well."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service. We will not be back and this was our first time. Food and drinks were good but really 20 minutes for a drink and she never came back to check in us."}
{"text":"Pretzels with cheese dip on a warming candle, awesome.  Burgers big enough to share, fried chicken good as well.  Wings not enough meat on them, these chickens. Tricerahops on draft and wild blueberry lager, interesting. We even picked more up at BeV Mo on the way back to Cali"}
{"text":"I made a reservation by phone for party of eleven two days before the date. And the day I went to this place and told the hostess that I have a reservation, and she told me that they have another group come later so we only have two hours. I didn't say anything to her back, but they didn't tell me that we only have two hours when I made a reservation. So I know I shouldn't care about that. I don't remember how long we were there, and they didn't kick us out.
Our server was great. My husband complained that our Crunchy Shrimp Caesar Salad had blue cheese crumbs are in it. And he took it off from our check, and he told my husband that he just wants us to have a great experience tonight.
We told them that we have 5 kids in our party when I made a reservation, but they didn't give us kid's menu until we asked our server to bring it.
I love their pretzel ball,  beef stew was not exciting, Fish & Chips was okay. 
And their kid's menu size is big, kind of shocked lol
Very noisy, hard to find a parking spot. Fun place to hanging with friends."}
{"text":"Oh my gnocchi!!  So soft like little pillows that I want to float away with.  It came w/ shitake mushrooms that really complemented the cream sauce which wasn't heavy at all. Also the portion was really great too!!  Not too much but just right!

My hubby had the burger which was good but nothing too special about it.  But the fries were good!  Get a side of the bbq sauce to dip them in!

The only negative was that we opted to sit outside but at a lower table so we were crouching over our food which was uncomfortable but overall great place to check out what kinds of cars are parked in valet!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was better than the food!  I forgot his name but he was the best, he gave us a good recommendation for some off the strip entertainment!  I ordered the crusty bread which was overpowered by balsamic vinaigrette, so much that I didn't get any hints of the garlic. My entree was the garden kale salad which was doused in dressing and a side of fries that were forgettable. My friends ordered the chicken that wasn't fried hard enough to their taste, the chicken club sandwich and fried fish on the other hand got two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Today was one of the hardest days for my mother. She just came to AZ yesterday for vacation only to take her poor puppy to the hospital. Even so this place still made her day!! Not only the vibe and the eclectic fashion, the service was phenomenal. Jess made it a little better and catered to each and every need of my mother, going above and beyond the job of a server. We will definitely be back!! And we feel so blessed and thankful. THANK YOU JESS AND CULINARY DROPOUT!!"}
{"text":"The waiter was nice and informative. The scenery was very artsy and had a college vibe. It was great for everyone though. The waiter recommended the meatloaf so I tried that. Hubby got the chicken and biscuit I added a biscuit with honey. The meatloaf was exceptional it was flavored like old school meatloaf but with a tasty sweet sauce on top. The mash potatoes that came with it was great with gravy. The green beans had a slight crisp and were perfect. Hubby said chick was moist but flavoring a little off. He loved the mashed potatoes and biscuit. We enjoyed our experience just wish they also gave veteran/ military discount. Overall we Will come again"}
{"text":"I had one of the best lunches I have ever  had in Las Vegas at Culinary dropout. This review is mainly for the service, drinks  and ambience of this place because we Batley had any food. My sister and I went and had our usual sister lunch which ended up turning into a tab of 20.00 for food and 140.00 for drinks because they were just so good! We both had a salad, I had the salad with fried shrimp and it was good! I know that my sister enjoyed hers as well. Our waitress was great and drinks came fast. We must have had at least 5 to 6 different one's and ordered off our waitresses opinion. Every drink was delicious. The setup is cool. Every table is different nothing super fancy and matching but cute. Had a great view of the pool at the hotel. Couches and huge relaxing chairs in the sun or couches in the shade. Great place to come for lunch and will definitely have to come back for brunch which is supposed to be great on Sunday's!"}
{"text":"Neither thrilling nor horrifying, a solid A-OK. 

From the 'nothing over $20' menu to the wait staff who don't wear uniforms, Culinary Dropout is trying very hard to be unpretentious. Located in a prime spot near the Waterfront and Fashion Square, it ends up being a place where people want be seen.  Look at Meeeeeee!

The interior is a large dark open space. This is good for finding the people you are supposed to be meeting, but bad in that the acoustics are not the best. Depending upon where you sit, even before the live music starts this place gets loud. Very loud. Huh? What? Yeah, I said LOUD! 

The menu contains an assortment of comfort food as well as some pretty creative sounding cocktails. Feeling brave? You can even get a 'paper bag special' beer for $1.95 that could be pretty much anything. 

Our group of 8 started with appetizers: 
Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue ($10) - these are puffy balls of soft pretzel bread served with a pot of cheese for dipping. While I love my cheese probably more than almost anything, this reminded me of melted American cheese slices. I think a spicier or sharper cheese would have been better. 

House Potato Chips with Famous Onion Dip ($6) - I love fresh potato chips but these were really, really greasy. The 'famous' dip (who decides that, by the way?) was just OK. 

Crusty Bread with Good Olive Oil ($2) - basically what it says - slices of bread with a small bowl of olive oil. 

I had the Roasted Chicken Salad, with sour apples, pistachio and dolce gorgonzola ($12). While this was fairly good, I should have asked for the dressing on the side. There was a lot in there. Probably enough for two salads, so the lettuce quickly became squishy. The chicken portion was pretty small but I did enjoy the overall flavor of the crisp apples and crunchy pistachios and cheese. 

Our waiter was great, but the runner who brought out our food was clueless. She didn't seem to care that she was just putting items in front of the wrong person, and we all had to shift the dishes around ourselves to get to what we had ordered. She also carried the salad bowls with her thumb inside of them, touching the food! Ick... 

I think this place could be fun for drinks or happy hour (day-drinking, anyone, when it is cool enough for the patio??) but the food was just average.  I would rather wander next door to Wildfish..."}
{"text":"Came here for my farewell lunch back to NJ. Very fun atmosphere, waiters dressed to impress and most of all the food was delicious. Definitely recommend to come here after a long day at work to unwind."}
{"text":"I've had to eat here twice and I regret it both times. The service was mediocre at best. Some decent apps like the pretzels and potato chips. And the Kale salad was decent. But both mains I've tried, the Korean Ribeye cap and Meatloaf were terrible. No flavor. They do play some good music.

Had to eat here for a third time because we didn't have a choice. Had their wing. No flavor. Seriously, is this some sort of joke? How is a place where I've tried several things and most of them were tasteless get such a high amount of stars on Yelp. I feel tricked. I actually was looking forward to trying this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is great, the service is amazing. Not only are they attentive but they are fun. I love the vibe of this place. Outdoor fire pit. Live music. One of my new favorite places in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The decor in this place is pretty amazing lol, from what I'm told by my party who compared it to the other location that's located in downtown ASU in Tempe, this one is pretty fancy!

Been cravin' a burger all day so I got The PUB Burger and a Pom Mule. We also ordered the pretzel bites w/cheese and I could honestly eat a whole basket of those soft pretzels and cheese by myself! Loved it, the atmosphere is pretty lax, music is loud (which was fine with me!), space is open, we had a really great time hanging out while eating lunch here!

But since I live in Tempe, I would probably hit up their location over here more than I would in Scottsdale :)"}
{"text":"Started out very bumpy with a wait that was not managed well but they recognized this issue and went beyond expectations to make it right.

Great atmosphere, live music, and food was  great.

Will plan to come back again and I am sure it will be 5* next time."}
{"text":"Got to say, this place would have been better if our waitress had paid attention to our table. It took 10 minutes to get our drinks after we sat down, which is pretty poor considering the restaurant was not busy at all. Once we did, the drinks were not correct, and the waters we asked for were not brought. That may seem trivial, but we were pretty specific that we would like water as soon as possible since we had just gotten off a plane. 

Food came out super slowly, and the quality was not as described, which was disappointing. Thumbs up on the ramen bowl- it is very spicy. The French dip was yummy, and the pretzels and cheese is a must. Nachos, fried chicken, grilled cheese were not ones to try. Any place that uses Kraft singles tasting cheese is a no. Sorry, we wanted to like you."}
{"text":"Food is always awesome.. giving 5 stars for our server today, though, Alex M.. super friendly and attentive!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"After attending a great show at Gammage theater today, we went to an early dinner at Culinary Dropout. I ordered one of the signature dishes ( fried chicken) that they have highlighted as being one of there best items. The chicken was not cooked fully, somewhat bloody. 
The service and atmosphere was pretty good but I will not come here again nor would I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place and see how it was. The place it's self is cool the decor is eclectic and fun. The bar that opens to outside is nice and if I came to drink I'm Sure it would be fun! If you're coming for amazing food, skip this place. The food was the worst part and it's the reason I won't be returning. The pretzel sticks were extreme salty and the cheese with them was not warm. The tacos were the worst tacos I've had. the flavors were strange i thought tacos were a food that just couldn't be messed up, I was wrong. My daughter also had the burger which I figured I would taste to get more of an idea how the food is, that was not good either. The menu is very  limited and not much that caught my eye. I dine out very very often and this places food really needs help. I think with a menu change and food expert to come in and perfect it this place could be a true gem."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is incredible, the customer service is amazing, and the food is fantastic.

I came here with my girlfriend for Labor Day, and from the moment we walked into the store we were impressed.

As starters, we ordered the Prosciutto Di San Daniele as a Meat Antipasti, and combined it with the Garlic & Herb Goat Cheese, which was a wonderful combination. 

She ordered the Italian Grinder, and I ordered the Fried Chicken. Both were great, especially the Italian Grinder. I actually enjoyed her meal more than I did mine, although both were very tasty.

After all this food, I decided to order the Grilled Cheese Sliders (apparently my eyes were bigger than my stomach) and I couldn't eat them. Half of the reason was because I was pretty full, and the other half was they just didn't taste that good. My expectations were soooo much greater than what actually came to the table. They make them sound and look way better than they actually are. Three tiny little grilled cheeses with a quarter of a slice of bacon in them, which apparently are supposed to have tomato as well, according to all the other reviews I've read on here, but mine didn't come with any; alongside an ungodly amount of French Fries, which I can't really complain about, because their fries are amazing.

Overall, I am very pleased with this restaurant. The food (for the most part) tastes great, and the atmosphere is really cool. Plus, they have $3 Sangrias for happy hour! Unfortunately however, $10 for that unimpressive Grilled Cheese Slider plate is gonna cost you guys a star. I will definitely be back though for that Italian Grinder."}
{"text":"Many recommendations brought me here. Sadly I don't think it was that good. The service was poor due to the clueless waitress not knowing much about ingredients in the items on the menu and the food came out cold. Also, our entrees didn't come out at the same time. Couldn't really tell if food was that good bc it was cold. I didn't try some of my boyfriends famous turkey sandwich but I didn't really think it was anything to brag about."}
{"text":"Obsessed with the fondue pretzels!
Love the pastrami sandwich, pub burger, mac burger and French dip. I'm sure anything here is great!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere! Great server. Food was very average, Not much flavor at all. The server made it sound like it was farm to table quality, in reality it was microwaved sisco food. The hipster vibe was annoying as well given the low quality of food served."}
{"text":"This has become a regular spot of mine for the past year and for multiple reasons. The atmosphere is unique with a touch of hipster mixed with a touch of rock n roll. The servers do not have uniforms which helps to give that impression of a casual setting. There is an inside and an outside seating area and a full bar with super strong drinks and an honest selection of beers. All of that is great but isn't the real reason the place marks my top 10 list in Vegas, it's the food. If you go here for no other reason than to eat pretzels, you will still leave satisfied. The pretzels are bite-sized pieces (although tough to get in one bite) with an amazing provolone cheese fondue.  I have tried most dishes on the menu and none of them disappoint. This is also a great first date place where you can get a meat/cheese plate with a glass of wine and not have to worry about what side of the plate to sit your fork. Excellent."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a recent weekday.  We ordered a small bread plate with balsamic syrup and pimento cheese ball, plus deviled eggs as a starter.  Fantastic!  I then had the kale and corn salad with shrimp and it was amazing.  The dressing was tangy, the shrimps were smoky and filling, and the lemon zing made it all harmonize for a good half hour of bliss.  All this paired with a Sauvignon Blanc that was perfectly dry yet pineapple-fruity on the nose sent me to s happy place despite the hellish heat just outside.  I will be back soon to try the games next door and other delights."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! I'm an out of towner and a family member told me to come here for an after flight drink and bite to eat. Everything our table ordered was awesome! They have a pretzel and cheese dip appetizer which is what dreams are made of. Their chicken sandwich and hummus were great too. My 6 year old and I had a blast playing corn hole, foosball and shuffle board. Everyone was super friendly and they accommodated to both adults and kids."}
{"text":"We went here last week to celebrate my friend's, new job. If you are planning for friday, be ready for the crowd. My first impression was the place is quiet happening with all youngsters, yard  was full with ping pong and other games. The music was loud and we and the waitress had to literally shout at each other for orders. 

We settled for some drinks, the cocktails tasted good but seemed a little over priced. I have removed all the stars because of the food. The food was ok, not that great and was very overpriced. we ordered thai chicken wings for appetizers and it was decent. I ordered salmon in entree which costed $22 and tasted below average. Their dessert chocolate  with marshmellow topping was good. 

I was happy with the place and atmosphere but not the food. Its a good place only if u planning for drinks, i would have been ready to pay more for the food if had tasted good."}
{"text":"First time impressions are the most important and Culinary Dropout made an ever lasting one. Everything from the service to the food was spot on perfect. The whole experience was so good that it's hard to believe it will be the same when I go back. 

I hope it is............"}
{"text":"The pretzels balls. ARE YOU JOKING ME. 

Delicious and a sick little place to have dinner. Very modern vintage in the place and good for a night out with the girls to have drinks and apps. 

Agave margs, yum"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great food, drinks, and service.

I went on a Sunday morning with a friend and sat at the bar.  There were a few bartenders working but the main one that waited on us was named Arly.  She was very personable and attentive and gave us some great suggestions.  I started off with a bloody mary, which I like spicy, and she was definitely on her game.  I also tried \"The Smashed Irishmen\" which was also amazing,  I am a huge fan of both Guinness and Jameson and the cocktail is great.

For food I went with her suggestions and wasn't disappointed.  Me and my friend split a couple appetizers, including the Monkey Bread and Pretzel Fondue, and were very happy.

I will definitely be back cus everything about the experience was great.  The other bartenders were also nice and attentive, but when I go back I hope Arly is behind the bar."}
{"text":"Visiting from cali,hands down the best service the best food very fresh fish and chips the bomb ,monkey bread awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food gotta try the pretzels with cheese fondue, service personal were super nice,food is perfect no matter what you get the atmosphere is very laid back mandatory stop when your in AZ"}
{"text":"The pretzels and cheese are the best thing I've ordered there. Salads are adequate but the menu is sort of random. This location has the best atmosphere of all the locations. Just avoid during the summer months."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and my new favorite restaurant.  We had a few cocktails, a little antipasti, the ribs and the butternut squash ravioli.  Everything was just great.  I had a whiskey cocktail, of which they have about 4 on the menu, and really enjoyed it.  As a whiskey lover who is not yet badass enough to drink it straight, it was wonderful to see actual house cocktails with whiskey that were nuanced and mild, and still let you taste the liquor. Both of our dishes were perfect and came in adequate servings and at the end of the night the bill was more than reasonable for the type and amount of food we enjoyed.  I honestly would have paid a lot more for it..  We went on a Saturday night and waited just long enough to have a cocktail at the bar first.  Our server was nice and although he only came by once, we had everything we needed and no complaints."}
{"text":"Standard Fox concept:  great atmosphere with overpriced basic food. The Yard is a really cool spot to take a large group and have cocktails and average quality food while playing games. Had somewhat of a \"hipster\" vibe to it like most joints in Central Phoenix do. The back is a giant indoor patio with lounge seating near tvs to watch sports and the end is full of games like shuffle board, corn hole, ping pong and fooseball. Real cool vibe in central Phoenix. I give 4.5 stars for atmosphere and 2 stars for food to make a 3."}
{"text":"The pretzel bites are to die for! I highly recommend getting them as an appetizer. It's hard not to eat too many though before your main dish, so you've been warned! The fish and chips there are so good! The fish is so crispy and tasty! Their drink menu also has many good options! Only had a few but I want to try more, they all sound so good!"}
{"text":"My  boyfriend was super excited to try this place, I'm pretty sure he saw it on TV and checked it out on instagram. We went there for brunch.

He got the biscuits and gravy with eggs+bacon and I got the two eggs with bacon+toast. We also ordered the Cap'n Crunch French Toast because it sounded AWESOME. And man, was it! It was deliciously sweet, fluffy and tasted a lot like Cap'n Crunch! The onyl thing that would have made me happier is if there were bits of the cereal on top of it, not just raspberries and powdered sugar. So tasty though!

Everything else was pretty good, nothing to write home about. I was craving bacon which was great. My boyfriend said his biscuits and gravy were a little weird, but he didn't mind too much. 

Really sweet, young server! An okay experience. I think we'll go again to check out a dinner or late night meal, we want to experience more."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here ! From ping pong ,corn hole to the bar I'm a fan. Culinary Dropout/ the Yard is right down the street from my apartment so I can walk there and not worry about parking. Like most bar/restaurants around the mill ave area parking sucks. So be prepared! The seating within the restaurant is comfortable and eclectic. The crowd is diverse as well ! 

Service : Interesting to say the least ! She kept walking off in the middle of us ordering.   I  really could care less about service as long as you are bringing me my food.  

Food : Pretzel and cheese fondue pretty damn good. The pork belly ramen was pretty bland. Then again I like my ramen spicy! 

Pricing : Slightly more expensive than most of the restaurants in downtown Tempe. But the atmosphere makes up for the expensiveness in my mind. Also It's one of the nicest places in the area other than La Bocca and House of tricks.

Keep in mind this location is still pretty new , so they are still working out the kinks. Be kind :) and check it out !"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, trendy, a lot of variety on the menu for people with different likes. Service is good. Outdoor seating is cute and they play good music, like how the bar is inside and outside. 

Loved the meatloaf - though I wouldn't put the sauce on top. The kale and sweet potato salad was delicious! Recommend those two.  Pretzels with fondue also good. 

Didn't get a drink but the drink menu looked good."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. Their meatloaf really is delicious. I NEVER order meatloaf and rarely eat it at all, but I decided to because the waiter recommended it. My friend got the curry and it tasted really good too. 

The best part was the dessert. We got the caramel custard with the popcorn on top and it was SO good. A little sweet, but worth getting. We both were fighting over the last bites :)

The live music was also really fun and I just liked the overall atmosphere. It seemed really fun and lively. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Had such a GREAT time at \"Culinary Drop Out\"  Adam Lippe gives a great experience!!! Loved his recommendations on drinks AND food!!!"}
{"text":"Though the General Manager insisted I contact him next visit to make things right, I elected to stop in \"under the radar\".  I simply asked the very nice server, Stephanie, if she would mention that my last sandwich was cold and I like them hot.  About 10 minutes later a fella from the kitchen served me with a smile and said, \"shaved prime rib dip, extra hot.\"

It was OUTSTANDING!!!  Problem solved!!!  I did ask for the GM on my way out... he laughed and said \"hey, you sandbagged me!\".  I knew if I asked for him up front things would be great and I sure don't wanna have to do that every time, though I sincerely appreciated his concern.

I'm back to being a happy customer of my favorite place and will be eating there again next week!!!"}
{"text":"I\"m a local, this place had been on my radar, finally. Seemed the food took forever to come out, once our our food arrived, plates HOT n top buns cold (not even warm). Service was good."}
{"text":"Great service. Great evening. Thank you !!  Ryan is a rockstar!! The entire staff went above and beyond making an epic Super Bowl Event!  Well done all!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, but a little pricey for what you get. The atmosphere was a really chill area (see pictures) which would be great in the summer. The turkey sandwich was really good and fresh. My family got the reuben which were very flavorful.  The downfall of the place is that there are many ingredients on each item which could not be good for picky eaters. The service was really good, but the waiter kept taking away our drinks when we still had a 1/3 of our drinks left. I hate wasting."}
{"text":"Came here with high hopes but ultimately left a little bland. The pretzels were pretty good, the food was aight, but it wasn't anything super extraordinary. Wish I could say more, but sadly wasn't very impressed..."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Prices are average. Customer service was hit or miss. Some folks were a delight, others need to not stand and gossip so much and be more attentive to their clients. The atmosphere was casual and with lots to do to make it a fun night out. Felt a little rushed with service once we got the food. Other than that a great place for dinner."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the east coast and the one thing that I miss more than anything is Culinary Dropout! You won't find a place like this anywhere else. It has great food, an amazing atmosphere, live music (including world famous DJ bad little king), and people that are one of a kind. The staff here is like family and they go above and way beyond to make this place unforgettable. If you want to have a good time, great dinner, amazing cocktails, and good company, go to the OG Culinary Dropout.

{"text":"The food is always off a weird menu with not much selection. I got a french dip sandwich (one of the few classic options) and it was pretty good. The outside seating has very few misters like 5 in the center only so u r left in the unrelenting heat if theres no seating inside (there wasnt any when
 we went). We had to find our own seating there was no hostess at the time. My alcoholic drink tasted like it had no alcohol. Our server screwed up the kids order and it took awhile to even get one or for her to come around. Then Our server had to leave in the middle of it, but the 2nd server was a lot better. Also with that being said they do have a lot of outdoor activities like foozball, ping pong, cornhole, etc. if u can stand the heat to keep kids busy."}
{"text":"The adult playground restaurant! The atmosphere is great for groups! The surrounding restaurants are a nice touch if you want something else or more. On the downside they close somewhat on the early side, and sometimes when your into the live music and patio games this is a bit of a Debbie downer."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  So obviously I listened to the yelp reviewers and had the pretzel fondue appetizer and it was delicious.  Everyone at the table loved it.  The ambiance of the place is kinda nice, I think I'd enjoy going there for some live music.  It was dimly lit and they had some football on, so all was good.  I had the meatloaf, something I'd never usually order out but I tried it.  It was very good, especially with the mashed potatoes and gravy.  Nice comfort food.  We also had that Spanish thin sliced smoked pork for the table which was great.  I got to try a piece of fried chicken.  While it was no Lolo's, it was damn good.  I'd order it next time."}
{"text":"Food is bland, lacking any flavor. Prices are over priced for the small amount of food given and wait staff seems uniformed. The venue itself is a good place to bring a group, lots of games and a probably a good place to grab a few drinks.

Clearly a place more suited for large groups looking to hang out and maybe grab a small meal or split some appetizers. 

Going for dinner on a date night, I was very unimpressed but would be willing to give it another chance as a larger group destination."}
{"text":"We had such a great time last time we were there.  There was a band on Saturday that was so easy to listen to and relaxing called Vinyl Station!  They sound great!  Our food was good and our waitress was nice.  Its nice to watch people having fun with all of the games, and seeing the food coming out for parties.  Nice presentation!"}
{"text":"Cool place with great food and service. I went here solo and had a great meal and fun time."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was AMAZING!  I've been wanting to try this place for a while.  I've heard parking isn't great but we came for late lunch so it wasn't bad at all.  I could see it being hard to find when the place is busy tho.  Sorry I didn't take any pictures this visit, I was too busy stuffing my face with all the delicious food!  We had the pretzel bites and fondue for appetizer by recommendation of our server.  My husband devoured the fish and chips,  I sank my chops into their prime rib dip and homemade chips.  I was hesitant to try it at first but so happy I did, it's one of the best french dips I've ever had!  I hate when the meat isn't cut and cooked right,  but it was done to perfection.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place in my search for somewhere to eat for lunch. Such a great atmosphere! Very busy and lots going on but I sat up at the bar and service was great! The bar is hopping with different drinks. I had the grilled chicken club with a side salad and it was a lot of food! Very tasty and nice presentation! They have their own private parking lot and it's not a really busy area so that was nice and convenient! Will definitely be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"fried chicken plate - pretty good
caeser salad - good, a bit tart
service - good
they can split the order in half for you and a guest."}
{"text":"Just finished a wonderful lunch with my younger sister, mother and grandmother here before the aorport. The food was delicious; my mother and I shared the Caesar salad and the chicken club and it was a great portion for sharing. My sister enjoyed the sliders that had perfectly ripe tomatoes and crispy bacon with melted cheese, and my grandmother had the soup of the day. 
Our server, who I just forgot his name but he wears a black top hat and has a little longer hair. He was phenomenal! Perfect mix of professionalism and personality, he was very knowledgeable on the menu. I wouldn't be surprised if he was also a manager or lead server of some sort. 
Highly recommend coming in and enjoying a nice lunch here!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night back in November with my siblings.

There was a live band playing some good throwback songs, like \"Santeria\". But it was difficult to have a conversation with the person next to me because of how loud it was. It only lasted about the first 20ish minutes that we were there.

Our server's name was Jess or Jessie (I think) and she was great. She made sure we got everything we asked for. She provided us with useful information about the menu items when we asked. She had a very bubbly personality. Just great service from her.

As an appetizer, we shared pretzel bites with the provolone fondue. The pretzels seemed too salty for my tastes, but once it was dipped in the cheese...it was AMAZING. We considered asking for another order of this once we realized how quickly we devoured them.

I ordered the fried chicken, which came with mashed potatoes, cole slaw, and a biscuit. But I substituted the cole slaw for an extra biscuit. I wasn't expecting the fried chicken to be so damn good! Seriously, it was the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life. It was crispy and I don't know what kind of magical batter they used on the chicken, but it was just perfect. I wasn't a fan of the mashed potatoes. The biscuits were so good. They were soft and the honey on top just made it that much better.

For dessert, I had the salted caramel custard. And it had caramel popcorn on top. I'm obsessed with salted caramel desserts and this one is HIGH on my list. It wasn't too sweet. And the popcorn on top was probably what made it so delicious. Not only did it taste good, but it gave a nice crunch to this dessert."}
{"text":"What can I say but this place has something for everyone.  The atmosphere is electric and staff are simply excellent.  We put our beverage fate in the hands of August our personal mixologist and what he created was nothing short of amazing.  We ordered the charcuterie and the Cap and both were plated impeccably. In summary you get a five star experience without the five star price tag.  My thanks again to August for the amazing libation creation, SOLID!"}
{"text":"Speaking just about the food, this place is okay. The Pretzel appetizer with fondue was one of the most simple but tastiest appetizers I've had in a while, and all the entrees were at least ok. Where this place absolutely falls apart is the service. 

Our waitress was very nice and even treated me to a drink for my 21st, but it took almost 20 minutes to get our drinks and we were never given refills. Our appetizer took another 30 min and finally the entree took a ridiculously long 50 minutes. Combine that with the limited menu and I can't go past 2 stars. The drink was tasty though"}
{"text":"I seriously love Culinary. The energy here is amazing!! The servers are all so hip and trendy. I've never had bad service here. This was my first time at the Scottsdale location and the inside is a lot different than the Tempe one. I love them both though! If you go you must get the pretzels and cheese. Walking through the restaurant you'll notice just about every table orders them! This past time I got the steak tacos. They were great although three cost you $17. Not complaining though. The drinks are great too! I can't remember the actual name of my drink this past visit but it was champagne, gin and strawberry simp. It was great! Im also a fan of their sangria. I got watermelon last time at the Tempe location while my friend got the pickle back shot. It's a mini bottle of Jack with a shot of hot pink pickle juice as a chaser. It was cute! Anyway I love culinary and my friends and I have most of our birthday parties/ events there. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"We got to check this place out during its soft opening and it did not disappoint. 

Food is great. 

Mixed drinks are on point. If you like whiskey, try the Smashed Irishman. 

We didn't get any beer, but their selection is great. 

Our server (Kirk) did a great job at recommending drinks at dishes. My wife almost ordered a spicy drink, but he warned her and turned her to something else...super thankful. 

Two must haves: 
1. Pork Belly Nachos...amazing!
2. Korean Style Ribeye Cap...super tender and delicious. 

This place will be our new spot in Tempe for sure. 

Welcome to The Yard!"}
{"text":"Very loud, very busy place especially for a Wednesday night. Gastropub in this farmer place slash airport hangar. Menu has lots of stuff, appetizers including \"make your own cheese board\". I got the fried chicken plate and it was okay. Disneyland chicken is better and about the same price. The biscuit was hard and cold, the mashed potatoes were slightly salty. The best thing ? Roasted Brussel sprouts ! Very tasty."}
{"text":"To who it may concern:

The atmosphere was of the upmost enjoyable experience. However as a \"help me I'm poor\" woman... I was very disappointed in the brown bag special. The first couple \"brown bag\" specials were surprise crap beers... But by my ninth it was just Milwaukees best. Just kidding... I love Milwaukees best... (P.s. Don't take the brown paper bag with you... You will spend the night in jail)"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened on Sunday (11/22) but the service wheels fell off the bus! 20 minutes to get drinks, when they came .....2 were wrong, 10 minutes for waters, had to hound the waitress down to get another round of drinks. We frequent the Tempe location a lot, but had people in town to entertain and they were staying in Old Town. Not sure if there wasn't a manger on staff or a new waitress but it was the WORST service ever that day. The bartender looked stressed out as maybe he was all alone?  Besides the food, the service is what I end up enjoying the most at CD. Very frustrating day here and won't return to this location. As the waitress handed us the bill is when she finally  said \"sorry about all the delays\". Really? Mgmt needs to work on their staff and keep it typical of the other FOXRC locations. Signed, a loyal FOX restaurant patron."}
{"text":"Trendy hipster drinks, great service, really decent food and great ambience + style. I highly recommend the Room Service drink and Bourbon Black Bottom Pie if all you want is desert and a drink. Whether you sit outside on the patio next to a fire pit by the pool or inside at the rough hewn wooden community tables, this place is worth a visit if your in Vegas at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Service, food, ambiance, all of it. I'm from Colorado and I wish there was one in Denver. Jealous there are 3 in the Phoenix metro! 
I inadvertently ended up here on an ASU game night so lots of fans and the game on. Super friendly, fabulous open space. 
I tried the antipasti plate which is made up your choice of meats, cheeses and other snacks. The grissini is a tall thin crunchy breadstick. Terrine is a fig date walnut granola bar thing. Also tried the pretzel fondue. I've never had such a delicious bowl of soft, warm, pretzely goodness. And then add melted cheese. Heaven. 
Some interesting signature drinks. Extensive beer menu with several AZ brews. 
Live music on Fridays and Saturdays, although not sure how that works with the game on? 

Oh and didn't even get to 'the yard' a large covered outdoor patio (with misters cuz it's AZ) where several games of corn hole can be played."}
{"text":"Egg sandwich for the weekend breakfast menu was good. Did not feel like it was anything special though just another breakfast sandwich on a bun with bacon and avocado."}
{"text":"Scottsdale, AZ-Pretzel fondue and meat and cheese platter for appetizers, and it was very filing. We didn't eat much of our burgers, turkey pastrami or chicken club because we were full. Overall the food was good. Drinks were also pretty good."}
{"text":"After driving for 6.5 hours from El Paso, we had agreed that dinner had to be somewhere that we had not tried before. So, after a quick search, we settled for The Culinary Dropout off of South Farmer.
The decision to dine there ranked right up there with taking the correct fork in the road, choosing to stop at the stop sign and then spotting the police officer who was parked and was monitoring the intersection, and turning in the lost wallet and then being met by the wallet's owner with a firm handshake and a sizable cash reward. 
The service: amazing. Young, fashionable, and totally courteous were the hostesses. They found us a nice table and threw in an extra chair without any eyeball rolls or drama.
The food: da bomb. The Korean Ribeye was a no-wonder-it-might-not-be-available kind of entree. Soft, flavorful, and blended well with the accompanying vegetables. Strawberry and Kale salad: loved it. Fresh, bright, and tasty. The Monkey Bread for dessert: freshly crafted, served warm and ready, and blow-away dee-lish-us.
The waiter: truly a classy gentleman. Sayuj  (pronounced Sah-yooj) was a no pressure advisor that guided us through our choices. His recommendations were spot-on and we enjoyed our food immensely. 
I could go on and choose not to. Regardless, we loved the place, we were treated well, and I am 100% confident that you will enjoy the place as much as we did."}
{"text":"Great Service 
Menu options were not too impressive. Dogs was good but not excellent. I love the ambience."}
{"text":"Sara was great! She adapted to my personality real quick and was conveniently sarcastic which made me laugh and enjoy my time here ! Drinks were perfectly recommended and precisely on time . As a GM at a restaurant, she's everything a server should be.. outgoing and efficient. Good hire! I'll be back ."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles and my friend had the meatloaf. For appetizer we had the pretzel ball with cheese dip. Not a big fan of this place.. the food was just mediocre."}
{"text":"Yum! Loved all of our food. The kids mac and cheese, corn ravioli and trout. Portions were small so get an appetizer. I could've kept eating the ravioli. The pretzel fondu was OK but wouldn't get again. Our server Brittany was very sweet and accommodating. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere / friendly attentive waiters and staff and ranks high up there no doubt in food and cocktails ! The beets with goat cheese outstanding and the mussels were delicious . A great people watching spot and choices galore for where to sit. Extremely comfortable chairs !"}
{"text":"I love the open feel of this restaurant.   The service and food is always great.   I always order a cocktail, pretzel bread with cheese and salad.  This time we ordered ton of appetizers before ordering our meals and some items were a hit over others.   Love coming here with co-workers and friends.  I do wish  the food and drinks are the consistent.   I feel like once we stop ordering drinks, the staff is always in a rush to get you out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for Happy Hour. The manager is very kind and the service is great. I've only ordered appetizers and drinks. They have a nice assortment on both fronts."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere, service and music. A great place to take out of town guests."}
{"text":"Irritated! Ordered a grinder! I pointed out there was no oil and vinegar or Italian dressing.  They brought me the ingredients, they forgot. One item I was not aware was on the sandwich. I took the sandwich apart and made it the way it was suppose to come.  New server, new cook, doesn't matter, I was mad as hell.  They took it off the bill but I didn't come here for a make it yourself and it's free deal. It was handled horribly!  My friends were laughing and making jokes about the lack of manners.  I'll probably try one more time.  If the service and food is this bad again, I'm throwing in the towel.  They went from great to idiotic."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for date night. It's got a porch like atmosphere and the fried chicken & mashed potatoes is hella good."}
{"text":"I am giving it two stars based on the food alone. The food actually deserves a better rating but the service this passed Friday evening was SO bad, we almost walked out. It was the worst customer service I've experienced! When we complained the waitress had the audacity to blame it on us. And it wasn't just our waitress, we even tried asking other waiters for a minute of their time and we were completely ignored. They were all rude and acted like we were imposing on them."}
{"text":"I loved it! Our server was so nice and helpful in choosing our options. We got the cheese fondue, the muscles, pork belly nachos, and the ahi tuna salad and it was amazing. The atmosphere is very nice on the patio as well. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Came with my girlfriend and my family. I ordered the steak with fries and the steak came medium well even though I ordered it medium rare. My brother's order was not put in at all. The manager was very gracious about it and re-ordered my meal and offered a compensation for my meal because I ate after everyone else had finished their meals. The area we sat in was freezing cold. At the end of our meal, our waiter said he took my meal off the bill but it was very obviously still on the tab. I'm not sure why someone would say that and then not actually put in the effort to take it off the bill? He was probably one of the worst servers I've ever had. Happy that the manager made his best attempts to make up for the lacking service from our waiter. Not sure if I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Highs - Soft-baked Pretzels and Fondue Cheese Dip.  Yum!  It's such a popular appetizer here, which is kind of unfortunate because the pretzels are coming out on the colder side, not tasting as warm and fresh as I'd like.  

Homemade Lemonade - Dee-lish!  They do it right here.

Caramel Corn - Unexpectedly out of this world.

Lows- The rest of food  I've experienced here.  Bistro Steak?  Came out raw yet tough yet chewy.  Confusing? Yeah, I don't get it either. I sent it back and the server was very responsive and brought me out a burger instead:
 Pub  Burger on Pretzel Bun - Sounds like it would be great, but the quality and taste of the beef seems to be lacking.  

A week later, I gave them another shot.  This time I had the turkey pastrami sandwich on pretzel bread.  This is what I'd order if I were to come here again."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with this spot unfortunately! After reading yelp reviews I was very excited to try this place out. Upon arrival we were seated very fast and the server came over and took our order. The service was not he best, but also not terrible. 

The food came out and two of the three orders were prepared wrong.. not a huge deal and I fully understand mistakes happen, but the server was not overly willing to correct the mistake. Also, the food was not very tasty.. it was just ok, and definitely not worth the price. 

When the bill came there was a mistake and we were charged for two sandwiches when we only ordered one. Again, mistakes happen.. but we waited about 20 minutes for the server to come back and correct the mistake."}
{"text":"I really loved the food at this place. It was also fun and our server was great! Just a tad loud! I had Korean Brussels sprout. Prosciutto deviled eggs and sherry glazed beets with goat cheese and it was all wonderful. We had the s'mores pudding for dessert   Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This place is good. Oyster on the half shell are good they come with a sauce that's non traditional but blends well with the oyster taste.. different.. I ate the Shaved prime rib dip ... Great sandwich once you blend it with the sauce that's provided it Melts in your mouth. I definitely recommend this sandwich."}
{"text":"Food: I came with some friends, so we got to try some different things. We split the BBQ pork nachos and the pretzel rolls with fondue. Both were delicious, with a good ratio between topping/dip and carb (we actually had leftover cheese!). I ordered the ribs, which came with fries and coleslaw. The meat came off the bone easily, but the ribs could've been a little meatier. Didn't really bother me though, because I still had half the rack leftover for lunch the next day! The coleslaw was eh, but the fries were nice and crispy. My s/o got the steak, which he liked, except he found the horseradish slightly overpowering. 

Service: Phenomenal. Our waiter checked in on us a lot (without being intrusive) and had great attention to detail. 

Decor: I get that it's supposed to be trendy and all, but I didn't really like the interior design. Its modern and chic, but impersonal. I've driven by the downtown location, and based on outside appearances, that location would be better if you're looking for some ambience and warmth. 

Parking: There were a lot of parking spots, which is awesome, but this place is clearly hella busy, and so it took us a couple circles to find a spot. I saw when I was walking in that they have a complimentary valet service, which would probably be worth preparing for, if you are meeting people there. (Finding parking made me late to meet my friends by about 10 minutes) 

All in all a great experience. Would do again, but probably at a different location."}
{"text":"Had a party of 3 and they wouldn't seat us outside because the tables were for 2 or 6 people. A few minutes later a white group of 3 came with no reservation and got seated. When I asked the hostess she basically shrugged her head and kept walking."}
{"text":"This is my latest favorite place in Vegas, and I definitely want to go again. First, it's off the Strip at the Hard Rock, but it's worth the adventure to get there. The best way I can describe it is as a classy Cracker Barrel -- but that's way underestimating it's goodness. The cocktails, mostly bourbon based, are homemade and distinct, and I particularly loved the bourbon with papaya juice, jalapeno and bitters. I am a southerner, so I'm a sucker for great fried chicken. I was told that I had to try it here, and I was not disappointed. The buttermilk crust was crunchy, thick and perfectly browned, and the meat very succulent and juicy. The fried chicken entree came with a very hefty 3 pieces, all sprinkled with honey. I would put it in my top 5 fried chicken list. I also enjoyed the French onion soup, though the very large piece crouton...really a slice of bread ... was a bit much for this low carb eater. The service was very friendly and attentive, and we had a great time. For those who prefer other things than fried chicken, the rest of the menu had very attractive comfort food options that ranged from fish, to meatloaf to chicken. Definitely a place I'll return when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! So far we have loved everything we have ordered and I'm on a mission for the best french dip in the valley. As of right now, these guys are in the lead."}
{"text":"Let me just admit something right off the bat. I ate SO much on my most recent visit here that I am almost (yes, almost) ashamed of myself. But when the food is this good, you can't stop yourself!!

The house potato chips with onion dip....OMG, get in my belly! So flavorful and crispy! Then, let's have a little chat about the soft pretzels and provolone fondue...I may or may not have eaten almost an entire basket by myself!!

Ok, and then here's my major confession: I am a veggie-saur, but pregnancy cravings have me devouring a juicy burger from time to time and this my friends was one of those times. The pub burger was incredible! Juicy and bursting with flavor! I could only fit half of it in my stomach after the little incident with the house chips and pretzel bites.

The service was amazing and the decor is gorgeous! They will even give you a tour of the restaurant at any time during your meal. What a great place to hang with friends, co-workers or your special someone. 

The house potato chips, did I mention those yet?? Get them!!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is delicious! The food is awesome and the ambience of the restaurant is really relaxing and fun to enjoy with friends or a date."}
{"text":"Boisterous upbeat atmosphere in an outdoor setting; made for a great start to a Friday night. 
I ate: Korean Ribeye, Fried Chicken, 36 Hour ribs, 
         Crispy Shirmp Caesar salad.
I drank: Budlight
Pros: Attentive service but not annoying.  
          Diverse menu
          Solid food that was tasty with a good 
          presentation. (Sent the old French Fries back 
          but fresh new ones quickly arrived)
          Korean Ribeye is straight fire!
Cons: Very little self parking, you have to valet (but 
          it's free. I just don't like people touching my 
          stuff).
          Not the best place for conversations, for it 
          gets a little noisy. (But it's cool, there's not 
          much to say when you are playing corn hole!)
Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came to this place after a very long day of work with 8 other guys. Have to say, the beer selection is outstanding and the atmosphere is great. 
Had the fried chicken, and it was amazing. Very well seasoned and good portions. 

Mystery beer and shot for $5 is pretty awesome too. 

Staff is friendly and helpful. Would come back here again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Got a sitter lined up for Saturday night so the hubs and I could have a date night. We had been to a couple Fox Restaurants in Phoenix, and enjoyed them, so we set Culinary Dropout for our destination.
 
7pm on a Saturday night, we did not have reservations. The place was not packed, but we were told all the tables were reserved and so we had to sit at a large high-top communal table in the bar area. No big deal. The service was prompt and very friendly. We started with the recommended pretzel bites (they were very good and enough for probably 4 people). Draft beers were $2.95, which I thought was pretty awesome for a Friday evening, and liked even more when I saw the selection. Standard domestics, but also Sierra Nevada, Joseph James, and a Prohibition Lager. Good stuff! For dinner I ordered the fried chicken which was really delicious. The outside is crispy, with a little bit of honey, and the meat inside is nice and juicy - juicy not greasy! It's served with cornbread, cole slaw, and mashed potatoes, which were all excellent. I ate about half of it, and was so excited to have the rest for lunch the next day, but I forgot my to go box on the table! Boo I hate when that happens! My husband had the bistro steak, which was good but not great.

I was very happy when I requested a mocktail and the server asked me about my preferences. We sat and hung out for so long that she actually brought me 3 different mocktails throughout the evening. Awesome!

The food is a little overpriced, but not for a place in a casino. Our entire tab was ~$100 with tip (included 3 beers, 3 mocktails, 2 entrees, and an app).

Best of all, Jeremy Cornwell was playing from 7-10 and taking requests! If you haven't seen this guy, he's an awesome one-man-band type of show, where he records each beat and then plays it on loop, recording the next beat over it. We talked to him after his set ended, and he'll be at Culinary Dropout every Saturday night, 7-10, and Blue Martini every Tuesday and Friday."}
{"text":"Pretzel bites with the fondue cheese are delicious! Really cool, chill atmosphere outside if weather permits."}
{"text":"Loved it. The Pub burger was incredible... And don't skip that pretzel cheese dip stuff. Amazing. Cute, hip atmosphere that still dealt well with the fact that we had a kid in tow. Nice."}
{"text":"First time coming here, on a Saturday night. They have live music on Friday and Saturdays which was a neat experience!
Must try the pretzel bites with cheese fondue. It was delicious."}
{"text":"They re-did the outside bar area to high tops & its better than before! Perfect for a cocktail on the patio :) LOVE the deviled eggs \"snack\" on the meats/cheese menu. $3 for 3 , we got a double portion. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"We we're seated promptly & received great energy and a brief description of the restaurant concept and menu from our server Jade. We then enjoyed some of the selections from the anti pasto menu. Some of the others in my party savored the fried chicken and it was the \"most crispy, juicy, and fresh\" they've ever had. I had some of the biscuit that came with it and it was fluffy & delicious, and the Cole slaw could not have been improved upon. Even my Arnold Palmer has something special about it. Thank you Jade & Culinary Dropout. Well done from a server in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and check this place out, it tends to get crazy so you should definitely make a reservation (yes, even if there's two of you on a Tuesday). Also, \"Christmas Whiskey\"."}
{"text":"This place was great. Aubrey was the best. He was extremely kind and professional and we really appreciated him. We asked for something off menu which he kindly obliged to and said he didn't think it would be a problem and followed through on point. Great food! Great drinks! Even better service!!"}
{"text":"Insanely good!! Don't miss this place when visiting.  Can get crowded,  but for good reason.  Everything was delicious! The trout, the salmon,  the rib eye,  the steak tacos thing,  the desserts,  we went once, 3 of us, awhile vacationing,  and had to go back a second time.  Fun place!!! Amazing good!!!!"}
{"text":"If you want to have dinner with friends at home at your own dining room and not worry about cooking something delicious.  - then this is the next best thing.  Easy parking, really, really good food.  Can't tell you a specially good food - cuz everything I've tried is Delilsh!  It's a great venue for large and small groups.  There is literally something for everyone on the menu.  And it won't break the back! Salud!"}
{"text":"What happened? I hate writing bad reviews more than anything because I love promoting local business. I hate writing bad reviews for restaurants I've previously had amazing experiences at even more. 
    To say the least, customer service here, at least last night, was horrendous. We arrived at peak dining hours--around 6:30, and knew we wouldn't be able to glide right in to a table so a wait was understandable. The first hostess was friendly enough and told us it would be about an hour and a half to two hour wait. We ordered drinks from the bar (really good!) the el diablo and the beer shandy and snagged seats at the outdoor bar. The bartender was a little arrogant and sarcastic which could definitely put some patrons off, but whatever, I had a good drink and can handle some snarky comments. 
    What killed me was when I went to check on our position in the line around 8:30. I walked up and all three hostesses were standing there talking and acted like I was intruding in on their conversation. She told me it would be another forty five minutes to an hour. Hadn't we already been sitting and waiting for 2 hours? I was annoyed and put off by this. We decided to leave the bar and stand in the lobby. To my distaste I watched as the main hostess greeted three men and when they asked how long the wait would be she responded \"everyone is canceling, it shouldn't take long\". I get it. Young hostesses want to flirt with cute guys, but c'mon. Customers are standing right in front of you that have been for much longer than \"it won't take long\". 
      Finally seated at 9pm. The food was delicious and our waitress was speedy and friendly. What a shame that I left with a bad taste in my mouth, and an even bigger shame for my friend that I brought who had never been here before. Not a great first impression for her."}
{"text":"Paisley is the most amazing! We visited the restaurant for brunch on a girl's trip/bachelorette weekend last week. The food was great but Paisley is the reason we loved this place. He was attentive, thoughtful, pleasant, and just the right amount of directivensss to help this group of powerhouse/crazy women create a brunch that was second to none. By the end, we felt like he was a part of our friend circle. In fact, we came back the next day and waited to be seated in his area. 

We love you Paisley! Thanks for making our trip that much better!

He basically should just train all of the waiters and waitresses in America...at the very least, he should get a raise or promotion!"}
{"text":"I love the name of the restaurant,  I love their pretzel fondue even more! 

Service:  Other than lunch visits for work, I usually sit at the bar to stay as close to the booze as possible.  Lunch service has never been an issue and the bartenders who pull double duty as your server have always come through.  Everyone has been friendly and social.

Food:  The pretzel fondue is my favorite dish there. lol  Cheese and the pretzel balls work so well here.  \"Ma..the Meatloaf!\" (what's she doing back there?) might be the only meatloaf I'll order in a restaurant.  Strong statement from a guy who's not into meatloaf. The pub burger and the BBQ Pork belly nachos are solid choices while drinking.  Speaking of booze, beer cans are mainly in the $6-$7 range with some great craft choices.  Tap beer rotation seems to be your mainstream IPAs, Guinness, and Bud Light

Value: Culinary dropout cuisine is a mixture of bougie bar food and some legit main entrees.  The pricing is fair as the quality of the ingredients and preparation is very good.  It can add up quickly if you're hitting up multiple dishes, but I'm usually here for the pretzels, beer and maybe another dish.  With that, I feel like I get a good experience for the price.

Ambiance: Dimly Lit at night with open room seating keeps it intimate as the tables are spaced apart perfectly for your privacy.  I've come across some live acoustic guitar on their mini stage which livens up the energy.  It's just a little too loud and is almost drowns out conversation at the table and it's another reason I sit at the bar which is furthest away from the stage.

Culinary Dropout is a great place to pre-game with your friends before a night out on a town or just a night out for a casual dinner and drinks.  Located in the Hard Rock Hotel, it's usually where I stop by before a concert there or before a night out close to the strip.  Location convenience and the consistently good service and food makes it a great joint that I can rely on  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"DROPOUT FOR A REASON...
(3.25 stars)

Well, one needs to re-enroll and learn how to plate dishes.


After several rounds of slots at the Hard Rock cafe, we came to Culinary Dropout to get something to eat. It wasn't our first choice or a priority, it was a place that came to mind last minute. I'll be honest, I didn't have any expectation. When we entered the restaurant it was pretty empty. I'd expect a little more of a crowd knowing ReHab is just around the corner. What I noticed was the minimal selection on the menu, nothing caught my eye. With no appetite and no prior research of \"what should I order\", I picked something quick and simple off the menu. Our table had fried chicken (heard it was good - didn't taste it), french toast (took a bite, pretty good!), and my order....

THAI CHILE CHICKEN WINGS - cashew, toasted sesame, cabbage, and lime. First and foremost, presentation was UGLY. Why would you blanket the wings with Asian coleslaw. I had to dig through the messy Asian coleslaw just to see a wing. Digging for chicken wings. The wings aren't the dry wings, they are coated with sauce. The sauce on the wings and on coleslaw are the same and it's that repetitive Asian sauce you see at many American restaurants on Asian dishes. After a bite into the wings, I was presently surprised that I actually enjoyed it. The coating on the wings weren't too thick but it does require napkins and wipes afterwards. 

I don't think I'll return because there are far more restaurants in LV to explore next visit. 

Until the next review...."}
{"text":"I always come to Culinary Dropout Scottsdale when I am in town. Today has been a terrible experience, it took my waitress ten minutes to take our drink order, and when she finally did, She rolled her eyes/raised her eyebrows at me, stood with her hands on her hips, didn't apologize for the wait, and was generally rude. She is about 5,3\" tall, blond, glasses, and large holes in her ears. Avoid this section!"}
{"text":"I tried the After School Special with modelo beer & a turkey pastrami sandwich/burger with pretzel buns. It had a slaw + horse radish in it and was served with a pickle a side of salad (you could have chosen chips or french fries). They have different salad dressing toppings but I went with champagne vinaigrette which tasted nice and light. I tried the chicken and waffles with biscuit and mashed potato and thought the chicken was cooked perfectly. It wasn't overly salty or overly cooked. The meat was moist and tender. The pretzel bun on my sandwich was super unique but filling. They had a live band play tonight called Vinyl Station. They played awesome cover songs including some songs by Oasis, Beatles, Cold Play and Black Keys. Our waitress was friendly/cool and the manager comp'd us on the chicken because no 1 actually ordered the chicken. They left out our fish and chips order on accident but it didn't take long for them to whip it up. The tartar sauce was perfect and the fish was great. I'd come back here again with friends for sure. The space is super hip, well decorated and fun. Music can be loud so conversing can get difficult."}
{"text":"I would be the crazy lady with a pom pom in the corner shouting \"PRETZEL FONDUE! PRETZEL FONDUE!\" when the server came to take your order. The other day my daughter had salami for the first time and told my husband, \"I want to marry 25 salamis.\" That, my friends, is how I feel about the pretzel fondue. Of course, if you aren't a pretzel lover to begin with, ignore my rant.

Also decent/interesting is the bacon Bloody Mary. I don't know if I would order another one, but I was glad to have tried it and, honestly, who doesn't like stirring their drink with a thick, delicious slice of bacon? I also ordered a meat-filled sandwich with spicy peppers. I can't remember the name of it, but I have a hard time believing there is a similar menu item. It, too, was delicious and very large. I took it back to the hotel and ate round two several hours later, before falling into a food coma. 

Our server was super sweet and they had nice outdoor seating. The atmosphere is casual and it seems to attract an eclectic group of people. It is part of the Fox restaurant group, if that means anything to you as far as their quality of food goes."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great live music, fun for hangout at the bar, really good Riesling drink and delicious soft pretzels.

Cool and friendly staffs, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour: Monday - Friday 3-6pm
HH Specials: $4 sangrias, $4 wells, $5 cheap wines

Although I love a good happy hour, we just couldn't fit it into our schedule to stop by during their HH window so we opted for a Sunday dinner. We chose right because we managed to get a seat for two with no wait at 7pm! 

To start off, we got a charcuterie board. Here you get to pick the cheeses and meats rather than the chef. The service here is fantastic though so I'm sure if you asked the waitress or chefs would be more than happy to choose for you. I also got the drink Between You & Me which was a light, fruity concoction. 
 
For our meal we opted for the black mussels and the fried chicken to share. The mussels were in this broth that was delicious. I almost wish it came with a pasta because all that goodness would have soaked into the carbs and made a delicious entree. They do give you bread to eat with the sauce but to me it just wasn't enough. The fried chicken was very crispy AND seasoned which are the two most important thing for me. The second most important was the fact that the server split the serving into two plates without being asked and still gave each of us a full serving of the sides. It's a small gesture that probably cost them nothing but it's the principal that matters. 

Service here is 5/5 and so is the food and atmosphere. I'm diggin' it and hope to be able to return!"}
{"text":"I really dig this place. But honestly, I just love the atmosphere. It's a perfect spot to go to on a nice day in Phoenix. It's admittedly VERY crowded during lunch and brunch (on weekends), but so far I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes. So, no complaints there. I do think it's overpriced for both drinks and food. $10 for most cocktails and $15 for a salad? Kinda steep, but it's a Fox Restaurant so not shocking. The food is above average like all his other restaurants, but nothing to write home about. The staff was very friendly, attention and tattooed! Holla! But like I said, it's the actual structure of this place that I really enjoy. Lovely natural light shining into the building, kick back with my $10 beverage and watch people play cornhole. Yeah, I'm good with that."}
{"text":"Oh where or where can my 5 star burger have gone?
Oh where or where can it be?
With cheese on top and juices dripping out
Oh where can it be?

Still looking for that 5 star burger.

Located within the Hard Rock Cafe, which is not on the Las Vegas strip sits a trendy little eatery and bar dishing out some ice cold drinks,  snacks, burgers and delicious dishes. 

What I loved here was the whole design of the resturant. The Ambience here is super cool. You have a variety of tables, chairs, couches to dine on, both inside and out. Outdoor seating gives you a clear pool side view. Service is right on track, with eye candy servers with pleasant personalities. Had a very resort like feel to it.

For starters we had the homemade chips and dip. They were fresh and yummy.

I was hoping to of found my 5 star burger here, but my burger did not deliver that 5 star satisfaction.  My hand made burger topped with Havani cheese and bacon on a toasted bun was on the dry side. It was complimented with a little side salad with basalmic vinegar dressing. My date had the fried chicken and mashed tatters which he thought was just okay.

Lunch for 2 was about $45.00

{"text":"Absolutely hands down my favorite nachos in the valley. Pork belly and high end cheese make these second to none.  The fried chicken is also next level with an amazing home made biscuit.  Amazing food and amazing atmosphere. Just wish I lived closer to the place so I could eat there more often."}
{"text":"Great service! Very cute for graduations and birthday parties. I love the interior design of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We recently ate at the Culinary Dropout and it was great. We sat at the bar but they had plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. We went for lunch and it was really busy so I would think a reservation would be required for dinner unless you like to wait. We had the antipasti and picked our meats, cheeses and sides, it was really good. Be sure to get the crusty bread with balsamic. For our meal, we had the butternut squash cannelloni, added chicken and the MAC Burger (a classed up Big Mac) and both were really good. They also have a nice selection of beers on draft and in a can."}
{"text":"Concept place with VOLUMES of space and an hour line sometimes, must be the ping pong!  Seriously, I've never seen such a large place and in an area I would have thought couldn't draw sufficient customers.  It was nearly empty mid-day and midweek but the staff said to not be fooled.  It really does fill.

Food is pretty good too but really I sense this is a group hangout spot."}
{"text":"Drunk so short review. 

Amazing service. Excellent drinks and great apps. We got the wings and I would recommend to anyone!! 

Start your night out on mill here!"}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere. Can be a little pricey but the food is worth it. Really awesome cocktails!"}
{"text":"As far as Vegas eateries go.. I thought the Culinary Dropout was okay. The menu read fantastically! But I thought the final edible results were just alright. The Yelp reviews are mostly raving, so I may in the minority. But had I not been staying in the Hard Rock, I wouldn't have made a bee-line to eat here.

That being said, I think it's a great bar. Great selection, the signature cocktails and mixed drinks are killer - great flavors and creativity. Just wouldn't plan on eating here when there are so many other great restaurants in Vegas. 

A bit lacking in the service department, too."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and happy hour specials. Loved the atmosphere. I was a bit disappointed that the outside area was closed for a private party but everything else made up for it.  Really cool place.  Chatted with the manager for a bit, he was super friendly and working his butt off bussing, checking on guests and serving too."}
{"text":"Kai is the best server ever! He pointed us to all the right things and the mystery beers for $2.95 are fun!"}
{"text":"Never heard of Culinary Dropout until  Roger Clyne of Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers posted on Facebook  that he'd  be  performing  there on my birthday-eve. The first part of a really great experience  started when I called for a reservation and was told I could get a patio table, everything else was booked. An hour later Ashley called back and said they had a table  inside, 4 back from the stage. Upon arrival we were seated front & center and immediately greeted by our server, Tori, who took really good care of us all night.  Interesting menu, not  same-o, but not funky either. Every item seemed to have something about it that made it a little extra special. We had seared tuna salad, shaved prime rib dip - with good fries ,  fried chicken! Apps buffalo  chicken meatballs yum but really good  was the pretzel fondu.  Because RC was there drinks made with Roger Clyne's Mexican Moonshine  were offered , which is the best tequila available  and should be offered  all the time.  All good to say about this place ,  nice venue, quality food and drink, fast service with a smile ,  seemed like everyone who works  here does because  they want to, making  this a go-to choice."}
{"text":"Drove by and decided to give it a try. Had the 36 hour pork ribs. The best ribs ever!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food at Culinary Dropout in Tucson, so when we were looking for a quick bite in Tempe prior to a show, we stopped here.  At 5p on a Saturday night we were told we would need to wait 90+minutes for a table.  We chose to sit at the high-top tables which are first come first serve.  Although our server was very friendly, the service was terrible.  It took a long time to order, and then the wait for food (and we only ordered appetizers and something off the kids menu)!  We got out in time for our show, but only because I asked for the check and to-go containers the moment our food arrived.  $30 for appetizers for one adult and one kid is a little steep.  I'll stick to the happy hour menu at the Tucson location."}
{"text":"Great outside seating on Camelback. Comfy living room or study type puffy chairs and lounges. Double bar inside and out. Great selection of libations. Would be good for a large group as they have room for a 20 ft common table. Think Harry Potter without the steeples. 7 TV's. with a big screen. Great stage for live music. I had just driven in from the OC and did not want anything heavy so I ordered the smoked salmon with creme' fraiche with a cold poached egg atop. OMG. Fantastic with the pretzel chip toast points- Really. WOW.  It was a Sunday , so crowd was light mostly 30 ish and some young families.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went to this place for my daughter's b-day. The first we noticed was that it was very classy and somewhat upscale style. After we sat down, we waited for about 10 min until our server finally came. Not a good start!!! Our server did thank us for our patience and the rest of the service was just fine. We ordered fried chicken and 36h smoked bbq ribs. These were their specialty which was indicated with stars on their menu. Now the food took long time until it came out but it did not bother us too much since we noticed that other people were having similar issue. The fried chicken was good but little sweet for my taste. The ribs were also good but nothing special. I was expecting little more than an average since it was bit upscale place with good reviews."}
{"text":"Been traveling last week through America and this was by far the best food I have eaten. Steak was cooked perfectly and service from staff was awesome."}

{"text":"This place was great. My bf and I were in town and looking for a place to eat when we found the Culinary Dropout, we went because of the name, the atmosphere was awesome, there was life music, the tables were spaced out perfectly, they didnt try and cram you in. It was just what we were looking for. they had games you can play, a free photo booth and misters to stay cool. I highly recommend this place(our waiter was not very great and they switched out mid shift which was a little confusing) But overall the experience with the food which was incredible, we got the prezel bites with provolone fondue and it was scrumptious. The friend chicken was really great as well."}
{"text":"Service is a huge problem. These young people are untrained. The server came and took our order.. drinks came ...then nothing. Then part of our entrees, then the rest of the entrees and then the appetizer ( each was delivered by different staff and we needed to advise that our order was incomplete). Then the original server came with the bill , I stated I would like to have coffee.. she discouraged  us \".. we just have regular coffee\"! The drinks were good, the food was okay but the service was abysmal. There are many choices in Tempe you should not have to settle for mediocre."}
{"text":"Great, friendly, hip service. 3 dollar drafts during happy hour (for any beer). Had the BBQ Pub burger. It was great and great in value. Ohkayy... what is really awesome is that this place has brown bag beer can specials for 1.95. That is pretty cool and makes this place even hipper.  The only thing I didnt like was the apptezier menu.. there was nothing really appealing. Lots of nuts on the appetizer menu.

Despite the app menu.. this place is really cool."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool! The atmosphere is wonderful! I love the chandeliers and the chairs are huge and comfy! We came in to have drinks and watch the ncaa tourney, and we ended up ordering food! Whoever thought of grilled cheese sliders with bacon is a genius!  Great place to drink, eat and watch a game!"}

{"text":"1 Star for decor
1 Star for the small bites crispy bread and good oil (seriously- so good, I wished the rest of the food was this good. I wouldve have been happy if this was an entire meal).

now thats thats out of the way, here's my not so great experience...

Went to Hard Rock to see Andrew Dice Clay. My BF and I were debating on either Culinary Dropout or 35 Steaks & Martini's. We decided that Culinary Dropout seemed like a really cool concept, so we picked this place.

We arrived, ordered drinks and a salad. We wanted an appitizer so I go to order the grilled asparagus. Our waitress said it wasnt available ok, ordered the artichoke hearts, not available. Ok fine, ordered the crusty bread (see above). Then we waited and waited to order our food, I kinda had my heart set on Fish and Chips and again, it was not available. That is a really bad sign, we should've saw the red flags when we ordered the apetizer and collected our check to go elsewhere, but we were pressed for time so we decided just to get what was available.

My BF ordered the meatloaf and I ordered the bistro steak. We waited over 30 mins for our food to come out. Our waitress, even knew that we were there a while because she kept checking on us.

We get our food- my steak and fries were aveage at best. Nothing special. I could've had the same steak at Norms diner (No joke). I really felt bad for my BF because his food was even worse than mine. My BF's food- The meatloaf, seriously tasted like it was from a cafeteria with a squirt of ketchup on the top. Not a special custom/mixed ketchup, it was straight out of the bottle (my mom makes a better meatloaf). ......and the mashed potatoes... were not edible. They were cold and bland. My bf took one bite and said they werent good. I tried them to see if he was being dramatic, and he wasn't. 

It was all very disappointing and I expected something much better- AT least the name is fitting to the food- Culinary Dropout. No kidding!

 I wished we had a better dinner experience on our last night in vegas. Oh well :("}
{"text":"Nice ambience, trendy decor, good beers, great service! food is ok. little too loud but its a nice place to hang out with friends. Overall, love this place!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. One block off is Mill Ave. has banquet facilities, extensive kitchen, unique drink menu, an outdoor eating area including gaming tables and more."}
{"text":"Came here before a concert at the Hard Rock, sat at the bar while waiting for the rest of our group.  Love the atmosphere and environment! Ordered the brown bag specials for 2.95 which includes a random beer in a brown paper bag, the first beer was a Rogue Tall boy! The rest of the beers from then on were either PBRs or Schaefer's.  Still no complaints for $2.95.  We also ordered truffle fries and the grilled asparagus, both good snacks but a little surprised the asparagus was served chilled.  Still ate everything and ordered the prime rib dip w/ au jus.  Sandwich was good, but wouldn't mind trying some other things on the menu.  I think I enjoy the atmosphere, beers/ cocktails and appetizers/snacks more than the entrees but will come back if I'm ever attending another concert on property.  *would love to come back and try their brunch!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is casual and i love it, from the outfits the servers/hosts wear to the service. It is casual but very cool, the waitress sat next to me to answer my question about the menu, it was awesome ! 

The food was good too, we had the turkey pastrami which was very unique, and the salmon was very good too but portion was a little too small. The chocolate/pecan dessert was good too but too sweet.
Overall a good experience, will be back :)"}
{"text":"Really used to love this place, our last visit wasn't the greatest, dining room maybe 30% full, we were told there were no available tables.  We made our way to the patio to be told those tables were reserved as well.  After approaching the host stand again, we were offered a table.  Service was very slow, salads came out at the same time as our dinner, and prices have gone up...  $3.75 for a fountain soda?  Kids meals for $6 plus $2.50 for a drink?  Not sure we will return, unfortunately..."}
{"text":"From the outside it look like it was going to be sort of ordinary of a restaurant, however walking inside the decor and design was amazing. The service we received was the BEST service we have had in a very long time. The waiters all came and help our table, it didn't feel like \"oh that's your waiters problem.\"  Our son had dropped a fork and two people came and help us before my husband got out of his seat. Now about that food, DELICIOUS!  The menu is simple which I like and everything is quality and great:) the portions are big some enough to share. After the best service, great food, we thought we were in for an expensive ticket. NOPE! Very fair priced and even made it that we would come back again and again! Thank you for such a great experience for our family!"}
{"text":"Having been satisfied by other Fox restaurants I was excited to hear about the opening of Culinary Dropout. So this Saturday the boyfriend and I were in Old Town and decided to check it out for dinner.

Upon walking in we were greeting promptly and sat right away (it was early). But then we sat for quite a while before anyone came over to our table. I was starting to get nervous. But our waiter finally came by and was more than attentive from that point forward.

We skipped any appetizers, but did stare longingly at the pretzel bites the table next to us ordered. Maybe next time. I ordered the Pub burger and the boyfriend ordered the gnocchi. I was glad that my burger came with fries. This was not stated on the menu anywhere which I thought was kinda weird. But whatever, yay fries!

Our food came out really fast considering they were starting to get pretty busy. My burger was cooked just right and had a nice flavor. The bacon was nice and thick, not that cheapo paper-thin bacon you get at some places. I was kinda hoping it was going to be as good as the burgers at Zinburger in Tucson (another Fox place) but it wasn't quite as tasty. Close though. The portion of fries was large. They were thin cut and were nice and crispy.
The boyfriend enjoyed his gnocchi. It came with sausage and was served in a cream sauce. I had a bite and thought it was quite flavorful. Not a huge portion but gnocchi can be pretty filling so it wasn't bad.

Even though we were pretty full the waiter talked us into ordering the monkey bread for dessert. It's served in a small cast iron dish and is sort of like a cut-up cinnamon roll with apples. It came to our table bubbling hot and served with a dish of vanilla ice cream on the side. It was very rich but the apples were a nice consistency and overall the sweetness wasn't overpowering. The ice cream helped cool it down and complimented the flavors well.

I can kinda see the bar filling up with some Scottsdale douche-bags at night but at least the staff wasn't pretentious. By the time we left the lobby area was getting pretty full so I imagine if you go after 7:00pm you'll have to wait for a table. It's worth checking out though so if you're not starving, wait."}
{"text":"Let's make it very simple they should have stayed in school. The food here is very subpar.  Great name great atmosphere but that's about it."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this place because my 10 year old son loves it. He has Angelman Syndrome and any chance we can go out to an upbeat, fun place he loves it. The entire experience would be awesome if the servers weren't rushing their guest out. Every time we come we enjoy taking our time to relax and have dinner. Because of my sons special needs he eats slower than most people but every time we come it's like the server brings the check before we can finish our meal. Tonight was an extreme case. The girl who took over our original server was rude and pushy. She never asked us if we needed anything just brought the check before my family was even done. There are no other people waiting to sit here so why push out the guest you have who determine your tip. I appreciate the restaurant but would love a little more time to relax"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times and haven't been super impressed, but my most recent visit was by far the worst. There was a wait which I didn't mind seeing as it was a Saturday night in Scottsdale. After we out our names on the list my boyfriend went to the bar to get drinks. The bartender didn't say more than 2 words to my boyfriend and just stared at him as if he was wasting his time. My boyfriend asked the guy what they had on tap and the rude reply given was \"beer\" as the bartender walked away. After throwing a menu at my boyfriend he stood there not saying a word. We ordered drinks and my boyfriend asked how much he owed and the rude bartender said \"'more than 5 less than ten, but I'll print you a receipt since you can't seem to figure it out\". We paid and walked away. It was by far the rudest behavior I have ever had from a bartender.  Our server was ok, but the wait was not worth the first impression of the night and the mediocre food."}
{"text":"Very unique, trendy atmosphere. I really liked this place. 

Service was great. Our server was Sally(if I remember correctly) and she had a very positive, upbeat, and professional vibe. Checked up on us enough but not overly which was perfect. 

We mainly ordered appetizers , which included Pretzel fondue, which was just absolutely delicious, the Antipasta, and the salmon appetizer. All the dishes were unique with their own taste. Presentation was great as well. When I am in AZ next I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"In my opinion it is overpriced and the service is pretty slow! I wish they had more \"regular\" beers to choose from. It's a cool place to go play corn hole and ping pong but other than that I don't really go out of my way to go there for fun or to hang out. 

Definitely would not go here during the hot months, the open concept bar and patio Is cool but if you want to be comfortable and not too hot I highly recommend skipping this place until the winter months and early spring!"}
{"text":"Back for the second time in 3 days and Culinary Dropout did not disappoint. A late lunch on the patio with great service by Jake. Of course I had to get the pretzels again but I also tried the chicken club sandwich. Everything was delicious and I have this restaurant as one of my favorites when I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I went here with my hubby for a date night. He went here twice before he took me for work meetings. He wanted to take me because he knew I would appreciate their food and vibe. 

I was pretty excited about the space. It is super urban and it kind of reminds me of restaurants I would see in Washington DC. So it did remind me of home so I was pretty happy about that. (My hubby knows me so well.) The space itself literally reminds me of an upscale warehouse. It's urban and funky. The vibe is very positive. They have live music on the weekends. So the atmosphere is even more funky just because of that alone. 

As far as the food, it's pretty good. 

I have to do a side note for those who follow my review and know that I love Korean food. You may wonder why I did not try their kimchi dishes.... I did not try their kimchi options because I grew up on Korean food. So if their Kimchi was not up to standard I would have been instantly disappointed in the place so I opted to go for a no kimchi dish. (Side note: I'm confused why they would do Korean fusion in a place like this... but then again I'm pretty picky about my Korean food... sorry for complaining) 

So to avoid instant disappointment from my love of kimchi I opted for their ribs instead. It was pretty good. It was fall of the bone soft and the sauce was layered with flavor. 

I also recommend their roasted beet appetizer. 

I will digress again... I also saw the cutest party space near their restrooms. This would be the perfect spot for a rehearsal dinner!!"}
{"text":"We give this establishment 4 stars for the outdoor dining and food. Both of which were very good and served in a timely manner. 

Then there is the \"entertainment.\" 

Some guy got on the stage and proceeded to try and play \"music.\" In the words of Herb Morrison, \"oh the humanity...\" 

My friend had to choke down his exceptionally-made banana cream pie due to the fact that the hired \"entertainment\" wouldn't stop desecrating the memories of those musicians whom he saw fit to \"imitate.\"

Luckily we were able to egress the establishment promptly thereby reducing the chance of permanent hearing damage. 

Ok ok ok, I realize this was a scathing review. The food and servers were outstanding, but the hired stage entertainment was terrible."}
{"text":"Not only are the dishes creative, but Culinary Dropout really delivers on quality as well. My sister and I split appetizers: Korean Brussels sprouts, beets and goat cheese, green chili cornbread, bacon/parmesan grissini, and prairie breeze cheese. Food came out in a timely manner and our waiter was very attentive. The only thing I wouldn't get again is the grissini...baked parmesan just kind of tastes like goldfish crackers. Next time I'm in town I'll come back for dinner and live music!"}
{"text":"In recent years Las Vegas has seen various forms of 'Gastro-Pub' appear here and there around town. 'Herb's and Rye' over on Sahara and Valley View,  'Todd English P.U.B.', at the Crystals Shopping with Aria and more recently 'Public House' at The Venetian. All offer a dining experience with lots of great food, great mixed cocktails and most with an extensive beer list. The food offerings are all similar with fresh shellfish at many,  braised and pickled meats, and often rich delicious dessert items. 

Enter Culinary Dropout.  Described as a Gastro Pub with 'Amp'd Up Food Fare', the newest addition to the pub scene also includes some pretty amazing classic style cocktails, as well as some more original bar offerings, and a tasty wine list. 

Among my favorite - the \"Smashed Irishmen' a concoction of Guinness, Jameson Irish Whiskey , Honey and Mint.. It's sweet and in my opinion, delicious is  truly an understatement. To go along with that, I had one of the most perfect Old Fashion Cocktails that I have ever experienced, finished with Luxardo Cherries and Fresh Orange.. I know, I know.. mixing liquor can be dangerous.. but seriously fun! 

The food menu is just as varied. An antipasti menu with a superior selection of cheeses, cured meats and vegetables, as well as some very 'comfort-food' style selections. There is a delicious Fried Chicken with Fresh Buttermilk Biscuits,  Pan Seared  Trout with an Almond Butter Sauce, and even a version Panag-Style Chicken Curry with Potatoes. For the slightly more foodie adventurous, Id say to give the Jambalaya shot.. House Made Andouille Sausage, Shrimp and Chicken.. with Pablano Peppers.. sure to set your mouth on fire. 

For dessert.. I'd have to say the Salted Caramel Custard topped with fresh Caramel Popcorn is my absolute favorite, but the Chocolate Peanut Butter Tart comes in close second. 

Whatever you end up with, Culinary Dropout has a nice hold on the idea of a place really being fun. Live music, great scenery and quality food and drink. You will find me here often I think. Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"A really fun and lively place with great service and atmosphere. One of the memorable highlights of our driving trip."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Culinary Dropout for a good while, last night the opportunity finally struck and I was not let down. Kristen and I went with our three favorite couples to celebrate an engagement, we decided to arrive at six thirty because they do not take reservations (I will never understand why restaurants choose to not accept them). Once seventy five percent of your party is there you get a little buzzer and your name on the list. 
      We found our friends sitting at the outside bar and joined them for some drinks. The bar is pretty awesome, there were several bartenders, so you never needed more than a little eye contact for quick service, and they have a ton of beers and specialty cocktails on the menu, from fruity and sweet to harsh and alocoholy. The seats were fairly plentiful and comfy, and there are also lounge seats all around the bar area for the outside dining, I thought the layout and design was attractive and used the limited space wisely, I'd love to come back for an outside lunch. The bartenders and waiters were friendly and attentive, all good looking (of course, Scottsdale) and all of our drinks (from beers to martinis to fruity stuff) were delicious and not too overpriced, I mean, they were overpriced, but not quite Scottsdale overpriced. So far, so good. We paid the tab and headed inside. 
      The atmosphere inside is awesome. I hope to someday open a restaurant, so when I enter a new business I eat it up, I devour the place, I pick apart the ambiance, the lighting, the noise level, the architecture and design, everything, and I really like Culinary Dropout. The tables are huge, slabs of hard, rough wood, very rustic and western, it is dimly lit with modern (not too loud) music playing, there is a surprising amount of room and lots of space for big party's, they have a stage for live music (awesome), Culinary Dropout really surprised me. 
      I will spare critiquing each meal and just stick with Kristen and I's, but just to be fair, two in our group had the beer battered fish and chips, one had the pub burger, one had the fried chicken and two had the shaved prime rib dip, and none complained. 
      Our group shared both the house potato chips, which were very tasty and fried just right, and the onion dip was flavorful, not some run of the mill dip, and the soft pretzel and provolone fondue, which was fantastic. A pretzel is kind of a pretzel, they were good, soft and all, but the provolone sauce simply exploded, man it was good, creamy and tasty, you should definitely try it. I ordered the fried chicken, which was delectable, it had a great but not overdone crunch, it was sweet and you could actually taste the spices, not just the taste of the fryer, you also get a lot of it, three big, juicy, tender pieces. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy which was good enough, nothing special, but only had two bites in it, and two very small but scrumptious biscuits with honey. Dear Kristen had the shaved prime rib dip which was fine, a little disappointing I guess, just not much meat, the meat to bread ratio was severely lacking, and it came with fries which were very good. If you're really in the mood for a prime rib sandwich, head to Houston's. 
      I will be back here for sure. I paid for Kristen and I, plus the newly engaged couple, and including drinks and all food it only came to ninety eight dollars, that is a bargain for this atmosphere and the overall quality of the food and staff. It also only took us about an hour to get seated, eight people on a Friday night in Scottsdale with no reservations? How can you beat that. Culinary Dropout is simply awesome."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is so much fun and has awesome food! It's a romantic place enough to go on a date and relaxed enough to take the kids to. There is indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor seating has nice open tables and bar you can sit at their full bar with spirits, cocktails and numerous beers on tap with TVs galore. Outdoors it's a cool, laid back atmosphere and is literally cool with water misters and covering from the sun. There are lots of games for adults such as pool, shuffle board, horseshoes, corn hole and foos ball! The kids ate their chicken tenders, my man and I ate the cheese burger, so good!! I had a couple of their cocktails, especially their copperless mule, so good!! If you are in Tempe you n Ed to eat at Culinary Dropout!"}
{"text":"Loved it! The pretzels and fondue were amazing. The atmosphere and vibe of the place was so much better than I anticipated. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went with a group and was impressed for the most part. The atmosphere is dark and casual, bar-type. The reason for the 5 stars lies in the food. It's rare that all 6 members of our family enjoys what they order when we eat out. A bit pricy for the portion, but the taste made up for it. Service was great, just wish there was a happy hour on weekends too."}
{"text":"Ok, so we had the crispy shrimp ceaser salad, bbq pork nachos, beets with goat cheese, deviled eggs, Brussel sprouts, chips and onion dip, monkey break, and s'more pudding. The s'mores pudding, golden beets with goat cheese and chips and dip were absolutely amazing!! Everything else was still delicious, but those 3 things were outstanding. They've got great service, a nice interior, and a convenient location! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Soooooo, I came here with coworkers after a long afternoon's hike through Papago Park/Hole in the Rock, and we were really looking forward to some good eats.

I will say that their service is definitely awesome. We loved our waitress! She was a total sweetheart for our table of 5. However, the food service was a bit lacking. :(

After waiting for something like 45 minutes to be seated (we had no reservations, so I highly recommend that), we finally sat down and took a gander at the menu. Note, we didn't mind the wait since we just hung out at the bar and ordered a few beers.

I ordered the Pretzels and Fondue appetizer for the table so we could share at our waitress' recommendation. Now, it IS tasty, but I didn't think it was anything amaaaazing. It's a heavy app, though, so if you're sharing for a table of, say, two people, you will be stuffed. STUFFED. lol.

The good news is that the P&F app came out swiftly like a coursing river. Unfortunately, our entrees did not come out with all the force of a great typhoon. :( In fact, it took our entrees nearly an HOUR to come out. :( Now, I understand that the kitchen was most likely backed up, but what I don't get is how 2 burgers were no longer hot but cooled down and how my salad (and my coworker's, since we ordered the same Butternut Squash & Kale salad) had missing items... namely the pecans, goat cheese, and a mere sprinkling of brussel sprouts. 

So yeah, pretty sad about the salad, though our waitress was quick to run to the kitchen to get the missing items. The salad was delish besides the wait, but I felt bad for my table-mates who were digging into cool burgers. :/ That, coupled with the super long wait was no bueno.

I give this an AOK however due to our awesome waitress, the yummy salad despite everything else, awesome atmosphere and sweet bartenders. Also, they have cornhole and ping pong, which we *should have* utilized during our long wait, haha."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience! They have very unique drink selections for starters - I had the Acai Mojito and it was luscious! My date had the Purple Haze beer (New Orleans) and enjoyed as well. We started off w/drinks and then ordered the soft pretzels w/cheese dip - yummmy! We both ordered the Shaved Prime Rib sandwich and were pretty blown away w/the taste - superb! Too full for dessert - perhaps next time? Our waiter (can't remember his name) was awesome was very speedy, answered all of our questions and took our picture from his new iPhone and texted it as a souvenir. :) Don't bother w/valet either - just park your car yourself in the garage for free."}
{"text":"I prefer the Scottsdale location over this one. I'm not even really sure why either...

Tried their fish and chips and didn't finish. I do believe they have like a smoky chipotle type spice used in their fish batter. Not that spectacular, IMO...

Service was FAB though - very friendly and fast. :)

Plus, this location is adjacent to The Yard. Go eat and drink, and then go play some Ping-Pong!"}
{"text":"Always have such an amazing time here, it's one of my go to spots for happy hour with family and friends !! Sangria is always a great deal for 5$ !!! I've spent my birthday here and many other special occasions !! This time we had Gina and she is one of the most friendliest server we've ever had !! We came with a mixed crowd of various ages and she made us all feel welcome and at home !! And as always the meatloaf sandwich is cravable!! The pretzels are addicting and did I mention sangria?? Lol check this place out for some good food and fun times !!"}
{"text":"I overindulged here last night in a pretty grotesque way.  Our server Corey was on the ball - when we arrived these HUGE, delicious platters of charcuterie and cheeses and accoutrements and bread and everything else you'd ever want were laid out on the table, along with, oh 7 different wines (there were 10 of us - don't judge).
Imagine my surprise when the menus came around after I had already eaten my fill of meats and cheeses to the point of wanting to unbutton my pants.
I knew I didn't have it in me to officially eat anything else, so I ordered the kale and sweet potato salad (which was delicious, and which I will be eating for dinner tonight) and held my fork at the ready to steal a bite of everyone else's food.
The chicken curry was spicy and delicious.  The fried chicken was okay, but had a weird \"undertaste\" that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  The meatloaf was as good as my Dad's, and that is saying something - it was seriously delicious, and was like, mini loaf sized, so not a small portion.  The ribeye was perfection - a little crunchy on the outside from a perfect sear, perfectly medium rare, and delicious.  Those pretzel bites with cheese fondue are about the size of tennis balls, so be ready for that - \"bites\" they are not.  I couldn't leave that alone unfortunately; I am a huge sucker for liquid cheese.
At this point I seriously wanted to die.  I could hardly breathe I was so full.  That is until the desserts that my sadistic dining companions ordered came out.  The monkey bread was good, the chocolate tart thingy was good, but friends - the caramel custard with caramel corn on top?  I will dream about it.
The staff is super hip and cool, the girls are amazing looking and fantastically dressed to boot, the guy performing with his guitar was perfection, and the decor is something out of my dreams.  How do you not like this place?"}
{"text":"Great place, great food and great service. Class act, just what Central Phoenix needed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and staff. The soft pretzels and fondue are great. Highly Recommend"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times since my boys went to ASU. The servers are very knowledgeable and excellent! Wish I could remember our last server. Super cool dude! The food is always good and such a fun atmosphere. Lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Came again in may 2014 and had the shrimp Caesar salad and it was amazing!!!! The way the shrimp is fresh and lightly breaded is so good, I ate the entire huge salad, nice light Caesar dressing too. I'll be returning for this specific salad!! =)"}
{"text":"Came here for a business lunch. Didn't know what to expect but found a gem. The place has a very hip warehouse feel. Think of restaurants in San Francisco. This place feels as if they transported one of the restaurants there into Tempe. 

Well the atmosphere is one thing but the food is among the best dining experiences I've had in a long time.

I had a dish called Korean Cap. It was perfecto.  Perfectly made steak marinated in a Korean sweet spicy sauce. It's hard to describe all of the tastes involved on this dish. You have to experience it for yourself.  

We then had a bourbon infused dessert, it was delicious but I bet that if you had the whole pie you would certainly get a DUI.  It's Rich. But it's really good. 

Overall it was a great experience. I will certainly be coming back. Service was also great and Victoria was on point with her recommendations."}
{"text":"As out friends drove in from the Q, (Albuquerque) my wife and I were looking for an adventure and a place we've never been. Some friends said this was a pretty decent place to hang out and they were right! The chips and onion dip were so good, we had to get two! My wife and I split the ribs and a salad and the drinks were a bit spendy ($10 drink night) but fantastic nonetheless. The service stood out as Jason Brown, the general manager came to out table and personally thanked us for our first visit, proceeding to buy us desert as a thank you. Highly recommended and my wife and I will be coming back to hang out!"}
{"text":"The food is always good, and they are always changing up the menu in someway! I tried a couple of their signature cocktails this time and really enjoyed them! Another great experience!"}
{"text":"You can't see it because Im writing....... But this Smile.....Ear to Fucking Ear!!! Im going to start with Dessert, because Im still smiling!!

I literally was moaning and laughing at how good this shit was. Salted Caramel with house made caramel popcorn. WTF indeed. So good. And I Skeet in my G-Star Briefs.

Pastrami Turkey Sand on a Pretzel Roll. Sounded Basic, tasted great! It ranks at my #2 sandwich of all time right behind the Muffelatta from central grocery store in the Dump that is New Orleans. A pile of warm and tender Turkey Pastrami, better than beef Pastrami, with cheese and coleslaw. Its piled high on a Buttery, Savory, Hot, Warm and slightly chewy Pretzel roll.  

Everything else I had was forgettable..... Roasted Beats were WEAK! 36 hour ribs were fair and the Cubano Sandwich was below expectations.

So, we have this line cook or chef, can't quite figure it out, with passion. He has spikes sticking out of his scalp and extending 18\" 's out like a weapon. A guy who looks like he should be doing my Tattoo the next time I knock someone out in the ring (Boxing) not gay ass MMA. Sorry! A Brunette waitress who is thick, not fat,  and pretty damn good looking seemed to float across the floor and was kinda exotic looking. There were some other waitresses there that were easy on the pupils too. A blonde with major hip swing. Tom, my waiter....pretty cool, kinda funny. I like him because hge suggested the Mouth-Gasm dessert. I thought he said it came in a shot glass, it came in a rocks glass, I bitched for a second, and ate almost the whole thing. Tjhis smart ass Tom says \" Well, you did not have trouble finishing it\" that was funny as shit. I said \" I did not say I couldnt, I did not want to\" 

Good Place. Go."}
{"text":"Took the advice of many others and ordered the pork belly nachos and the pretzels with cheese.  Everything was great, but next time I would order double pork.  There just wasn't enough.  The pretzels had the perfect amount of salt and were soft and warm.  Delicious!  The atmosphere was very lively, but not too loud and seems to be suitable for families.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The live music was very enjoyable!  I will definitely be going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch. First and foremost, the location can't be beat. Located at the corner of Camelback and Scottsdale Road in the middle of all the action. Ample parking, both self and valet. The hostess and wait staff was friendly and helpful. No complaints there. As as vegetarian the food options were seriously limited. I believe aside of one salad, hummus and pretzels there wasn't anything to eat. Asking the waitress for other possible off menu options, none were offered. Definitely disappointing for me. My host had ample to chose from and seemed to have enjoyed the meal. Overall the place looks the part, it comfortable and well-priced. However if you are a vegetarian or vegan this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"We had a good time here with our kids after a day at the pool. Service was on point with a super friendly waitress (can't member her name but she was Asian), and the food was really good.

The Good: We hit the Happy Hour pretty hard. Double Blinds, pretzel fondue, antipasto, red sangria (but not the white), chicken/shrimp, were all very good. Waitress was very attendant and she was great with our kiddos. Red liquorish Pinnacle Vodka may be my new favorite liquor store shooter. 

The Bad: No band playing during the week, sweet happy hour + band woulda been epic. 

The Ugly: We tried to sit outside in the Vegas heat at 5 PM (~98 degrees). Not a good idea. #schwettyballs

Overall we had a great time. I highly recommend their Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Culinary dropout is no dropout...it's more like a knockout!  I've eaten there quite a few times now and can honestly say that I've never had a bad dish

Pretzels & fondue: freshly baked pretzel bites with a provolone and fontina fondue are perfectly soft bites of ptrezel and gooey cheese. 

Turkey Reuben: boyfriend loves this dish. In house smoked turkey pastrami, coleslaw, thousand island on fresh baked pretzel roll. The turkey is tender and perfectly smoked. The side of fries are decadent an perfectly salty. 

Breakfast burrito: scrambled eggs (I opt for egg whites) sautéed pablano peppers, bacon and cheese wrapped in a soft flour tortilla and served with house potatoes. Very good, salsa on the side and the potatoes are delish!

Yogurt parfait: Greek vanilla yogurt, house made granola and fruit is a good light way to start the day. 

Prime rib dip: tender prime rib, fontina cheese, horseradish and au jus served on a homemade French roll. Tender, succulent roast beef, literally melts in your mouth. 

The bottomless mimosas on Saturdays & Sundays will start your day off right and their Moscow mules are light, crisp and refreshing. 

Located in the middle of the hard rock, the urban decor, the service and the food will get your day rockin"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. Will definitely be back. Had the pretzels with cheese fondue, ribs and fish n chips. Would recommend all 3."}
{"text":"Perfect patio for a Saturday!

This place walks a fine line between being too snooty and being just plain awesome.  I've had a couple of experiences here, and overall the food is really tasty.  I'm a fan of the gnocchi, even though it's a little different than traditional gnocchi.
The location is great, as long as there isn't a douche bag convention going on, and as long as the bartenders and servers keep their positive attitudes, I think this place will be around for a while. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, great drinks, all-in-all a fantastic restaurant - Go there now!"}
{"text":"We were seated quickly through our reservation, our server was excellent, she knew the menu well and very informative, and it was excellent for people watching, lots of groups dressed for partying, a few bachelorette night groups.  

The food tasted great.  The only thing we didn't like were the prices and serving sizes.  $23 for the ribs, they were tasty though very thin on the meat, not even enough for one person.  Drinks were small, expensive, though delicious.  Fried chicken was good, but again expensive.  The pretzel bread and cheese was the only thing at all priced for what you get.  We had appetizers before at an event but still spent $80 on one appetizer, two mains and two drinks.

Maybe stick to happy hour for good pricing."}
{"text":"Nailed It:
Cole Slaw-- I did most of my growin' up in the South (with a grandma from Huntsville, AL), so when I say I think I know a thing or two about cole slaw, you can more or less take my word for it;
Ribs-- my man said the 36 hour ribs fall of the bone. They did so;
Beet Salad
Negroni

Missed It: Brussel Sprouts-- currants were a nice touch, but overall not cooked enough
Smoked Salmon-- near miss
Service-- way off. When asked about a gluten free menu, my man tells me, \"When you take the gluten out, you basically destroy the dish.\"

Oh, word?

I recognize your restaurant's theme is basically the High Fidelity record store clerk's elitist brilliance/apathy-as-virtue,with the kitschy names and the irony of a bunch of uber-rich Scottsdale elites low-browing it with your $32 entrees, but at the end of the meal I'm gonna tip you on what'chu earned. Please don't come at me like a poor, righteous teacher when you're just coasting on the luxury of sweeping(ly wrong) absolutes from the zealot's cookbook.

You can have tact and still be rad, meals don't have to stand alone, unblemishable upon ivory pedestals, and the gaps between the recipe and consumer-necessity might be opportunities.

That one really put a damper on the experience."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Really wide range menu and the food is excellent.  The grilled cheese with BACON was gooey goodness and the soup of the day very flavorful! The pork belly nachos were made with homemade chips and guacamole. The prosciutto was so thinly sliced and just melted in your mouth! 
The server (Jeffery) was very friendly and made great recommendations!  Come to find out there is a location in Austin!!! 
Dessert sounded excellent but we were way too full... maybe next time??"}
{"text":"Great spot close to everything in old town Scottsdale.  Came with the fam bam here for dinner on Sunday night.  Place was empty but service was great.  Food was very good also.  I recommend the fried chicken, double cheeseburger, and ribs.  I didn't like the pretzel appetizer which they recommended.  Nothing special about the sauce.  Loved the other items I mentioned"}
{"text":"If your for a place with great ambiance and a place to catch up with family and friends this is a great place. They have happy hour menu from 4 pm to 6 pm Monday through Friday.  I ordered Korean Shrimp and chicken on a stick for $8.00 happy hour price that took what felt like forever to get and received one skewer to split with my uncle?  We ordered 16 oz draught beers for $4.00 each which I had the Firestone Walker 805 which was great.  The pub burger and fries were delicious.  The waitress Jenny (I believe) was very attentive for the most part but was not very informative and appeared preoccupied.  Wrapped up with catching up with my Uncle I did not realize I could have ordered 20 oz beer and was not solicited or up sold.  All in all the place was very nice, clean and good food but appetizer was extremely small portion. I will be back for sure to see if my experience on a weekend is the same or better."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience, service, and food. Cocktails were strong, steak was medium rare.  

The patio outside has ping pong tables and trendy outdoor couches.

The antipasti is a la carte, so you decide what's on that delicious cheese plate.

The only critique is that it is a very open space, so it's relatively loud in there. Perfect for a socialite like myself, but I probably won't take my dad there."}
{"text":"Came here at around 7pm on a Wednesday and it wasn't too busy so that helped with the service being faster. It's a large space so I can see how if it gets too packed the service might be slower. 

Ordered the black mussels, 36hr pork ribs, and turkey pastrami. The black mussels was a huge appetizer and could easily be shared between 2-3 people. It was good and just enough seafood garlic flavor but not too overwhelming. The turkey pastrami came out with fries and pickle and had a savory salty flavor on the bread that went well with the smoked turkey. The ribs were every bit as I expected 36hr pork ribs should taste like. The flavors were so infused in the meat that every bite was tasty. The dish also came with coleslaw and fries so it was nice that each dish had some savory sides to go with it. 

I really liked the drinks here though. I had the drunken panda while my bf had the pistols at dawn. The drunken panda had Lucky Buddha lager (and calamansi!) but they only put half in the mixed drink so they give you the rest of the beer in the bottle. It's a good summer drink especially with the cucumber infusion. Shout out to my server (I forgot his name) who suggested it and was super spunky, funny, and a good story teller. Also, is it just me or is it a requirement in this place for their bartenders and servers to be tatted. Because my server had full sleeves and tattoos all the way to his neck. They're all really friendly though so not complaining. 

Overall, I thought the food was decent, atmosphere casual with the option of eating out in their patio which had some outdoor games, and the servers were attentive but would suggest coming at a less busy time to get faster service. Would definitely come back for their happy hour to see how the vibe is and see if the food portions are decent for the price and to try their fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I give the ambience A++ . It's a little confusing bc their are three restaurants sharing the space.  I found that our party was enjoying an outdoor dining table but wanted to order oysters which is a different establishment. If they can find a way for the patrons to enjoy the entire space and eat off of any menu, I would give this place 10 stars! We need one in SC!"}
{"text":"Very chill modern place, the atmosphere is great and friendly. Good variety of apps and some of the best burgers!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink!  Server was great, lots of cool cocktails.  The pretzel fondue and mussel apps were awesome. Spacious - don't have to sit on top of other tables.  Game patio cool.  Def worth repeat."}
{"text":"Showed up with 2 others on a Saturday night with no reservations. Hostess found us a table despite being super busy. Our waitress was on point!!! She gave us great recommendations for food and drinks and never had to flag her down for refills. I highly recommend their pretzel cheese fondue (in-house made bread!) and the pork belly ramen."}
{"text":"This place is designed for sensory overload. The pretty servers with bangin' bodies and tattoos. The gaudy decor with the loud wallpaper. And the loud music and monstrous bar. It was a feast for the eyes. I wish the food had been the same. The pretzel balls are awesome, and that's about it. It's overpriced and disappointing."}
{"text":"Just an all around great experience, excellent service, fun ambiance and amazing food.  Live music and games make \"The Yard\" a fantastic place for date night or entertaining guests."}
{"text":"LEGIT.

Went here for my Birthday in December.  Did some dirnkin', played some corn hole, had some fun.  Double Blind if you dare will bring you back to a day in college!  

Tons of things to do between ping pong, corn hole, watch football, etc.  Good beers on tap, what more can ya ask for?

Had the Pub Burger and it was FIRE.

Also, the bartender makes a Vanilla Cinnamon Jameson (fireball-ish) that they have on tap if that's your thing.

DEFINITELY will be back."}
{"text":"Very spacious restaurant/ sports bar with a great crowd, unique with an outdoor area with sport games, great tasting creative meals, yes the pretzels with provolone fondue is very tasty as mentioned in prior reviews! Great selection of craft beer, too full to try the monkey bread, but it looked delicious. Very attentive service, despite a large crowd ( even on a Tuesday) Valet parking available, although we had no trouble with such a large lot. Kale salad was a big hit, as was the tuna."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour, serve a great menu, get the pretzels with fondue, and home made chips with onion dip, nice draft beer. Environment was bright, cheerful and active. Great stop after shopping at the mall across the street. Will return soon! Ps- manager even took time out to thank me for my review- very nice guy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service ,dinner, desert drinks absolutely fabulous!!  We're we're a table of 6. We had , salmon, pork chops, chicken fried chicken, and club sandwich!  Antipasto starters were amazing with the pretzel fondue! We all had the banana cream pie for dessert \"heavenly \"  .. I actually liked this location  better than Tempe !"}
{"text":"What a cool place!

Culinary dropout was one of my favorite watering holes in the area. With ample parking and HUGE seating areas, this place is great for groups.

I came in the afternoon on a Saturday and didn't have any of the service issues that other reviews have mentioned, but could understand with such a huge place how on crowded nights, it could slow a bit.

Still, being surrounded by such cool ambiance, I would find it hard to find something to complain about as once you get your food and drinks, you'll love it here. Especially with fire pits and outdoor couches, it's a comfortable place for big parties and a great happy hour location. I would highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Lord have mercy!!! 

We went and checked out the Culinary Dropout (finally) this past Friday for the hubs birthday. We love Fox restaurants and hadn't been to this one yet. 

The atmosphere is really cool, kinda loud and totally fun. 

Our waitress was the cutest thing ever! She was on top of everything and a real pleasure, I don't remember her name but she had blond and pink hair and looked like a pin up model! 

For starters we got the soft pretzel bites with the fondue. Seriously amazing, you will be cheating yourself if you do not order these. 

For dinner I got the fried chicken with the honey  drizzle, I loved it, super crunchy! However the mashed potato's that came with were very \"gluey\", I was not a fan of that. 

For dessert we had to order two because we couldn't decide between what to get, and I am glad we did! We were only going to get the peanut butter cup which was super amazing but then at the last minute I also tossed on the Carmel pudding dessert topped with the Carmel popcorn...OH MY GOD...I could eat this every day and never get tired of it! 

I am currently pregnant so I couldn't sample any of the cocktails, but the menu for them looked amazing, the husband ordered the crushed Irishmen and said it was very tasty!"}
{"text":"I first went to Culinary Dropout seven years ago and these many years later, it is still delivers an interesting menu, great service and fabulous people watching. The bar menu is extraordinarily creative, the food options are considerable."}
{"text":"Loved it! great atmosphere and the food was decent, the drinks were fabulous!"}
{"text":"I was excited to go to this place and once getting there my excitement grew even more. The layout is nice and they can accommodate large parties. I'm giving an average review because the food was average. I get it, it's a trendy cool place but the food isn't elevated to the same level. The prices wouldn't be bad if the food matched the value. The wait staff was also average.
One comment that was made over our meal was, \"I don't think they dropped out, they got kicked out!\".

Maybe it was just an off day... it still wouldn't hinder me from making a second visit."}
{"text":"36hour ribs should fall off the bone, these didn't. Great sauce and great atmosphere, wasn't that impressed by the ribs. Great pretzels."}
{"text":"Great food. Great drinks. Great decor and amazing service! The ribs were delicious. Has a neat industrial yet chic vibe. I imagine brunch would be great here especially with the large patio so you can people watch at the hard rock pool. Great locals spot. Will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Good food, not great but that's not what you visit this place for. The atmosphere is very tending and affordable. This is not the quietest eatery, so it's not the best place for a first but it's solid place to go out with friends in a group."}
{"text":"I saw an ad on the back of our taxi and just from the name we decided to go. That and i was meeting a client at the Hardrock. 

If you are entering the casino it's tucked away just off the casino floor over looking the Paradise pool area. We went on a fabulous weather day in Vegas. Low 80's with a breeze. We sat inside because well who wants body sweat and suntan oil smell seeping into your lunch? 

Decent fat friendly seating. 

We came with zero knowledge or expectations other than what we saw on the back of the cab. 

Nice surprise! 

The best part was the Service. extremely nice hostess, waiters etc. constantly there just in time to refill the drinks or see if we needed anything. 

Cocktails: My bloody Mary was hand made. Nicely prepared with bacon, cucumber garnish. Decent selection of beers both foreign and domestic. 

BEST PART of Food: a do it yourself antipasta bar - & raw bar. Huge selection of meats, cheese & veggies plus shrimp, crab legs oysters etc. (only one of us is not allergic to shell fish). I would go just for this. BUT 

They have mini grilled cheese sandwiches. and fall off the bone ribs and yummy close to mama used to make meat loaf. 

As a local to Las Vegas, we usually only go to casinos on or close to the strip when we have company or clients in Vegas but we have gone back twice just to go to Culinary Dropout. Worth the $5.00 to the valet to park. 

Oh and the pool eyecandy was nice too. No speedos to be seen."}
{"text":"Food was great. I had the steak and potatoes with a side of peppercorn sauce and loved it. Drinks are also good."}
{"text":"The scene and location here are awesome, however the drinks and food did not bowl me over. I ordered a Moscow Mule, and it barely tasted like it had alcohol in it. We also ordered the famous fondue, and quite frankly, it reminded me of eating at Wetzel Pretzels or Aunt Annie's pretzels but paying $10 for it. If I ever come out to Scottsdale again, I probably will give it another shot and try ordering different items, and hopefully it will be better because it was fun to hang out at CD."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome little joint inside of the hard rock.


Tasty food.


Tasty well mixed drinks.

Great atmosphere!

And everyone is super chill with awesome customer service! 


You'll never have a bad time here and it's diff from a lot of other places that lack originality there on the strip.


Fun, cool, and great food!!


Come check it out! 


Everything is super spacey and big so it doesn't feel crowded!"}
{"text":"Wow - this location is quite the hotspot for the business lunch crowd!  There is usually a wait for table - but they do a good job of turning tables over without feeling rushed.  

They have a great menu - always something yummy that is seasonal along with great classics.  Burgers, sandwiches, salads, and shareables.  We always get the pretzel bites to start - it comes with a yummy cheese fondue. 

Great service, good food.  Just be prepared for a wait during busy times!"}
{"text":"Always good food and the sangria is amazing!! Plus the staff is always super friendly and welcoming. And the restaurant is always clean! Down side they are always busy, so be ready to wait because they are that good!! But totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I went here for the NFL Season Opener, Saints v. Vikings, that Culinary had been promoting. We had a group of 8 and were able to get seated about fifteen minutes for game time. For a place with so much seating, I was impressed with their drink specials. $2 beers (mystery beers in brown bags) and an assortment of football themed cocktails for $4.  The food was also pretty good, we had wings, burgers, nachos, and chili. All of it was pretty good, better than typical bar food. 

While the food, beer and location was great, this is not the place to watch any NFL games. There is only one screen, and then small tvs around the seating area. Even if you are on the side of the table where you can see a TV, it's difficult to see everything on the screen because they are so small, and the sound system is horrible for watching TV. Needless to say, if your back is to the entrance, you're not going to be watching every play. 

This definitely made for a fun night, but it won't become a staple anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ate here three times in two days, it was so good. Great pretzel bread turkey pastrami sandwich, the pretzels with cheese fondue were also delectable! I will come back here. Also the patio faces a pool so it has a great view!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch so I did not experience a wait. Loved the atmosphere and the staff was really nice and attentive. The food was tasty. I had the pretzel fondue and the Italian chopped salad."}
{"text":"Hello!  Can you say awesome!!!  Stumbled upon this place while looking for a quick lunch before a Sunday matinee. Yes, the pretzel roll with provolone fondue is to die for!  But be careful, it's a large order and will fill you up quickly. My friend had the sweet corn cannelloni which was tasty and wonderfully unique, while I had the apple, currant, blue cheese mixed greens. The variation in flavors was outstanding and I especially loved the paper thin mandolin sliced green apple.  We both agreed this would be the perfect place to come to on a lazy Sunday afternoon; indulge in some good wine and go crazy on the separate, and vast, anti-pasta menu. Some proscuto, olives and a distinctly aried selection of cheeses. Yumm!  We arrived at 11:15am and by 12:00 the place was completely packed. Great atmosphere. Love the long bar, open kitchen and super cozy/comfortable seating. Well done."}
{"text":"Doesn't allow reservations. Prices are mostly reasonable. Kitchen works in slow-motion. 

Had several antipasti, decent, but not the best. Had the gnocchi, good and rich, however there was truffle oil that wasn't on the menu. Had it been, I would not have ordered it-I can't stand the smell."}
{"text":"Fabulous place! I don't like going out much on weekend nights because I don't like being asses to elbows with other people, but this place is nice and spacious so it never felt crowded. 

We just came here for post-dinner drinks and fun so I can't say anything about the food. Drinks were a little pricey (i.e. a Stella is $7). But they have a a cool $2 brown bag special where you get a random beer in a brown bag. I had wine, but Ryan got one and I think he ended up getting an Amstel Light.

There are 4 ping pong tables and 4 cornhole game setups spread out nicely in the venue. We played both games until closing.

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff is amazing and the meatloaf is one of my Favs!! Sorry mom.... I come to Tempe once a year for hockey and this place never disappoints. They're accommodating and would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a great evening out."}
{"text":"Top 3 Reasons I heart CDO:
 
*Pretzel Balls w/ Cheese Fondue
*Captain Crunch Encrusted French Toast (Only served on weekends for brunch)
*Pork Belly Cubano
 
3 Minor things that irk me about CDO:
 
*It's only open for brunch on the weekends.
*The staff doesn't have standard uniforms. They do however rock grey, black, or plaid vests mimicking employees at Forever 21 or H&M.
*The Gastro-pub theme is a bit played out, but at least the industrial decor and inviting patio keeps it current."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

Pretzel app was great, especially traveling from Philly. The atmosphere was good and the decor was nice. I enjoyed my experience, but I probably wouldn't come here again the next time I'm in Scottsdale. The food was good, but not memorable."}
{"text":"After reading about this place online and seeing the menu I had to give this place a try. Perfect for the after work spot since it is walking distance.

The decor is nice and the leather seating in the booths are comforting and the fresh smell of leather is inviting to relax and enjoy the experience. The staff is nice and attentive. 

I ordered the Turkey pastrami sandwich which delivered a great mix of savory flavors that welcomed me with each bite. The fresh cut fries were crispy and soft which complimented the sandwich as if they were married in heaven. 

Everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their food as much as I did. Some of the menu Items are priced reasonably but there are some that tip the charts. 

All in all the experience and food was very good and this is a place that I might frequent after work."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Took my family to the restaurant for lunch.  Had the yogurt because I was so full from last nights dinner.  Even though it was just a yogurt it was very good.  Not much to say other that just good."}
{"text":"The only thing I didn't like about this place was that there were flies everywhere on the patio. I could barely keep them out of my drink and food. If it weren't for that it would've gotten a much higher rating because the service is great and the food was nice."}
{"text":"I personally don't see what the big fuss is about. I've ended up a lot here recently because it is right below my office and that's where everyone wants to go for drinks and sometimes for lunch. I've come here multiple times with my office for happy hour and it took like 20 minutes before someone even took our order. My biggest complaint is that you can't do happy hour on the patio...you have to be AT the bar. Seriously...what is with that?  It is perfect patio weather 9 months out of the year here and I can't get happy hour outside? This is almost a deal breaker for me due to my extreme love of happy hour ON patios. Also, the service is pretty slow. . I do like the brown bag special just because it's funny and cheap and the Ahi Tuna Salad is good but not worth 14 bucks or whatever it is. I went the other night for a birthday dinner and they had live music which was cool. Convenience is what keeps me comin back. ...And the happy hour thing...C'MON."}
{"text":"This is in my top 5 of all time!! Couldn't stop smiling the entire time, everything was so delicious. I could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"Lunch for 3.

- Ambiance (5/5)
Awesome exposed warehouse atmosphere.  Open, laid back, and sophisticated.

- Service (4/5)
Quick and courteous.  Overly friendly, if that's possible?  Sometimes, I just want to eat my food and not listen to you gush about the restaurant.  But, seriously, if I were the boss, I'd be excited to see an employee so excited about the place.

- Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue, $10 (3/5)
Pretty good pretzels, though the fondue really just tasted like melted provolone.  Some more layers of flavor would have been good.  

- 36 Hour Pork Ribs, $23 (4/5)
Definitely falling off the bone delicious, though I did find the sauce to be a little bit on the salty side.

- Value (5/5)
Ridiculous portions for the price.

- Final Word
Awesome place to hang out and enjoy some really good food."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Was a fun place for a first date! Had a good time."}
{"text":"I am in love with the menu at Culinary Drop Out! Any place with a raw seafood bar is a win in my book. Pretty much everyone front of house is attractive and the place hums with a laid back vibe while maintaining a posh yet edgy atmosphere. So why the two star rating?

Everything sounded better on the menu than it actually was- everything just fell short of expectations. The service here was just terrible. The worst service I've had all year, maybe ever. We waited 20 minutes just to see our server for drinks, we waited even longer for water and the coffee that we ordered never got a refill.. Even though it was requested twice. The courses weren't paced at all so I had soup getting cold while a sandwich got soggy and my oysters got warm. Service is a total bust!

Unfortunately the food didn't make up for the bad service. 
The cheese fondue which was ordered on the recommendation of our waiter was really a glorified Velveeta. The soft pretzels were good, but really they're just a mode of transportation for the hot melty cheese which arrived at the table with a skin already formed over the top. Really appetizing (sarcasm). Overall, really bland, with no bite.
The white shrimp is served with the shell on but cleaned and they were fantastic! Perfectly cooked. Best part of the meal by far! I'd definitely make me way back here for a cocktail and shrimp cocktail if it's not inconvenient.
The Kushi oysters which are normally my favorite had a sort of funk, even though it was apparent they were shucked to order.
The French Onion Soup was quite possibly the worst I've ever had (and I once unwisely made the mistake of ordering French Onion at Applebees). Bland light colored broth with too much thyme, a round of tough rye bread topped with just a little cheese on top that had been cooked to death. There was no melty stringy cheesy goodness here that you have to wrap around the spoon to maintain a little dignity.. Just a stale crouton witha  crust of hard cheese floating in bland broth.
The warm Italian Grinder, also at the recommendation of our server, was nothing special and arrived crisp on the top.. But soggy as all heck on the bottom. This soggy-bottomed sandwich comes with hand cut fries on the side which were the best part of that meal.

Even though the service was so bad and the food so mediocre, I really did fall hard for their menu and will give it another go. I feel like maybe, just maybe, I ordered the wrong items and I got the wrong server, and just went on the wrong day. We couldn't even get our food boxed up and when we did (25 minutes later) it came back with fondue on the side and got my hand all greasy. The worst part of it all was when our waiter finally did come back after his lengthy disappearance and immediately starting clearing away plates, taking away a whole shrimp and oyster. That's $6 worth of deliciousness, man! Always ask before clearing!

Their specialty cocktail menu had a sleuth of amazingly well thought-out libations and that alone is enough to bring me back. The prices are very reasonable for the strip, and if nothing else- go for a drink, the raw bar, and antipasto. You can't screw up Italian cured meats with a top of the line slicer on hand."}
{"text":"Great dinner and Service last night. Paige was very attentive and friendly. The steak was perfect and the fish and chips were outstanding. The atmosphere, decor and entertainment aspect are very fun. Come try this out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere and people. The servers are pesky and let you enjoy yourself. The food is exceptional! Not what I was expecting for a hotel restaurant. And reasonably priced! If you are staying at the hard rock, check this place out! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"I came for breakfast since I wanted to sit outside and they do have a nice outdoor seating area, eclectic...but the food is average..."}
{"text":"The concept of this Culinary Dropout and The Yard is very cool. I love the large shared patio with lots of seating and bar games throughout the area. It's truly a great place to hang with some friends and put back a couple drinks and some pretty tasty bites. Much of their menu does not interest me as far as some of the Antipasti and cheese offerings, but I love some of the classic dishes they offer like their fried chicken and the fish and chips. I've had both and was very impressed with the quality of the dishes and the portion size (you should get a decent portion for the price you pay for some of their dishes). My favorite thing about going to Culinary Dropout though is hanging out and enjoying the nice beer selection and some of their cocktails. While sitting inside, it is pretty neat to see the open kitchen operating. I do plan on going back for brunch, which I realized as I read the menu again prior to writing my review lol. This Culinary Dropout is a solid place, especially if you're going with a group of friends!"}
{"text":"A place run by retards, for retards.  Nearly the worst, slowest service I have ever received.  Seriously, a real bartender can make more than two mixed drinks at a time. A prime candidate for Bar Rescue."}
{"text":"Arrrrgh I wish I could do half-stars!! I feel this place merits 3.5. 

The quality of the food is GREAT. Interesting menu with astonishing variety, quality ingredients and genuinely creative approach. My table shared the mussels and burrata pear thingy for apps, then I had the chicken curry while others had the ribs, the burger and the ribeye. Everything was great, and no pricier than any other gastropub in a Strip hotel. 

The atmosphere is a bit on the douchey side. It's REALLY loud, and opens out onto the epicenter of the douchiverse, the Hard Rock pool. The waitstaff are all waaaay too cool for school; apparently, the shtick is that there are no uniforms; they can wear whatever they want..which means trendy-slutty apres-pool attire for the ladies, and hipster-douche chic for the dudes. The service was OK; it was really busy (right before the Def Leppard show) so I'll cut 'em some slack for the lackluster nature.

I'd come here again, but on a slow night. I like to TALK over my meals, and it was just too freaking loud."}
{"text":"This place was a lot more casual than I expected. The food was good but the portions were small and pricey. The burger was not filling and a breakfast plate was very simple for its price. The most appetizing thing was the cereal French toast and the potatoes were good too."}
{"text":"Unreal! This place is one of the BEST restaurants in Vegas! From the drinks to the food to the service! JAMES! Is the best waiter! His hospitality is effortless. The food being from scratch or the drink amazingly made are great, but what makes this place amazing is their staff! From the chefs killing it in the open kitchen to the lady's in the front, thank you for the amazing food and hospitality!  Get the VELVET DEATH! Life changing lol thank me later"}
{"text":"I like the other ones better. Went here with a group of friends and saw everything on the menu. They have brunch specials on weekends but you can order from the menu. Had some of everything. It was all okay. Busy and loud place with a lot of activity going on, Played some ping pong. Kept getting assaulted by drunk guys playing besides us. Oh well. I will give it a star for drunken ping pong,."}
{"text":"They deserve every star. Super happy hour specials with 5 star service. The décor and wait staff are awesome. The food is even better. We started with the pretzel bites and cheese, OMG best thing ever. (Carb loading alert!) We had the salad with kale and dried sweet potatoes and it was super good. My friend then ordered the Big Mac copy burger. Which tasted just like a big Mac except it was good. Did I say pretzel bites? Do not go there without these. Check out my picks of the chandelier, the place is opulent. The bartender made us a spiced ice tea that was perfect for the chilly evening. Great for dates or special events or just because. Or maybe to get tanked after spending all your money at Nordstrom's...."}
{"text":"We came at happy hour. I am a HUGE fan of the Old Town location at Fashion Square and expected the same...nope. First of all, The Yard. If you've read past reviews, you know my opinion regarding children in drinking establishments. Parents, get a babysitter. It is not appropriate to set your little urchins free on the unsuspecting public while you order pitchers and shots, pretending to be interested when they stop in to tell you what they have been doing. Kid friendly places: Fuddruckers, Chili's. Anyhow, we tried the Yard but were over run by kids set loose, tossing bean bags from the Corn Hole onto our table. I love kids. Not when I am having adult times with alcohol. Sorry, moms and dads, you gave up your ability to be free and drunk when you decided to procreate. There are great babysitters available if you need a night out. But don't set your wild children free on the public. Back to the Drop Out. We found the pretzels to be undercooked, very doughy and did not eat them. We also ordered other items that did not quite measure up (we all agreed). There is just a lot going on here with the multiple areas. The service was not on par with the other location, we had to wave out arms and yell for our check because we were being ignored."}
{"text":"Good food and service! My friend and I came here for breakfast, where we had Bloody Mary's, two eggs any way dish, and the pretzels app. All were great.. highly suggest ordering the pretzels. They're awesome with the provolone cheese sauce! Our waiter was also fun to talk to and very patient with us (I was being indecisive as to what to order and he gave me great suggestions.)"}
{"text":"Another overrated and overpriced casino restaurant. Had yesterday's soup, which was watery and not really seasoned. Just tasted like a bad soup made the day before. Prosciutto deviled eggs were not seasoned with anything besides, what looked like bacon bits. Italian Antipasto salad was pretty good and a nice size portion. 
Good service, but music is way too loud and it was so dark I could barely see my menu. 
Overall not terrible, but not a place I would think about coming back to."}
{"text":"Excellent place!!!   Wonderful food and service!!


Brought a client and he thanked me several times for bringing him there!!  That's the best compliment in my book!!!!

Check it out and you'll be telling your friends about this place!!

Fun fun fun!!!"}
{"text":"Great location, plenty of parking and cheap drinks during happy hour. Loved the place but the food left a bit to desire. For example the pretzel app had delicious pretzels (and huge portions) but the cheese lacked flavor. The happy hour salad was the same. Very beautiful presentation but the flavor was just off, especially for an 80 degree day. It's worth coming for drinks and playing games but I wouldn't return for the food alone."}
{"text":"We liked this place well enough that we came back for a second time during our recent visit to the Phoenix area. The first visit was 5 stars all the way, but the second visit things were not quite as good, so I'll go with 4 stars.

The pretzel starter was awesome on our first visit! So much so that we went back just for these, but on the second visit they came out luke-warm and they didn't light the fire under the dipping sauce so that was cold too. On the first visit, they were nice and warm and awesome.

Food wise I liked the pub burger quite a bit, but the second sandwich I got was not as good. Salads were a bit hit and miss too.

They have many good beers on tap here, so that is a plus.

It is a big place with a large indoor area and also an outdoor area with games like foosball and other things to do. It was really hot when we were visiting so everyone was inside. One the second visit it was busier so we got seated in a separate room inside on a communal table. This room was fine and it was nice that they had some overflow space Vs having to wait.

They do have a nice big parking lot that was free to park at also."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I had the kale corn salad with grilled salmon and it was beyond perfect. My hubs had the pub burger. He really liked it but a bit greasy.... Still very good. Also had the room service cocktail and that was great. Decor is sooooo fabulous. Service was above. The monkey bread signature dessert was lovely! 
Gotta hit this spot up!"}
{"text":"It's a super cool idea.  It's half indoors and half outdoors with couches and cool lounge areas, ping pong tables, bean bag toss, shuffle board and good food.  Parking is sort of a pain and it's a little pricey but cool place to take a large group."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Extremely fun environment with friendly staff from the minute you walk in to the second you leave. Food and drinks were wonderful. The bartenders are extremely knowledgable and attentive. Soft pretzels and deviled eggs are must have apps. Very reasonable pricing and NO \"no-name\" cheap rails. (Some of you true enthusiasts will appreciate the significance of this alone) this is a must stop!!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. Ate here on Christmas Eve and the food/service was great. I had the Ribs and they were amazing. Sauce was perfect and fries were perfect. We played ping pong and drank beer after our meal. Very happy with our choice!"}
{"text":"Giving Culinary Dropout in Tempe 1 star for various reasons. We had reserved a table for 13 for a graduation dinner and were seated at the first table inside the door (no problem so far). Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, but it didn't take long for things to go downhill. For different reasons, a few of us got up and walked outside throughout our 2 1/2 hours at the restaurant (picture taking, etc.). For unknown reasons, security had an issue with that AND with us. The people in our group ranged in age from 20 to 65, and I only mention that because more than half of our group was over the age of 40, and NONE of us were being loud, obnoxious,or drunk. First of all, the service was extremely slow, hence the 2 1/2 hours, and several of our appetizers and entrees contained toast or bread, which was so burnt you couldn't chew it or even cut it with a knife. Right before we left, the waiter came over and said that we were \"cut off\". Thinking it had to be a joke, we asked both the waiter and bartender what we had done wrong and they both said that they didn't make that call, it was security. We then left in 4 separate groups, the last 2 standing beside their car waiting for a Lyft since they had a couple of drinks. At that time, they were in plain sight of security and as they were driving off, were flipped off by one of the security guys. Early the next morning when they went to get their car, they discovered it had thousands of dollars worth of damages from vandalism (it's a classic vehicle and several parts are irreplaceable) and the car had to be towed. We are about 99% sure it was security, but interestingly enough, there are no cameras on that side of the building. Will never go back there and the whole graduation experience was ruined for us. They actually deserve zero stars."}
{"text":"You can come here for a couple of reasons.  The first would be for a quality meal which is a good enough reason.  The pretzels and fondue are one of my favorite apps anywhere.  For dinner the pasta was fresh and delicious and I'd definitely order it again.  The sandwiches/burgers aren't that special and the fried chicken is pretty bland.  

The other reason you'd come here would be to get drunk.  Great place to do so.  On a budget?  No problem, order 5 brown bag specials and you'll be feeling great for under $10...that is until the hangover from 5 Old Milwaukees or Icehouses you just drank kicks in."}
{"text":"I will talk about my experience here for years. Best service, drinks, food, music and atmosphere. We ate here for a bachelorette party and there were a few other large parties there. Steve Ayotte was playing that night and he was AMAZING and super sweet. I will recommend Culinary Dropout to anyone I know going to Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Get the homemade potato chips, grilled cheese sliders, and monkey bread. You won't be disappointed. If you are, you'll get over it."}
{"text":"Second time i have been to a culinary dropout, first time at this one.

As always love the atmosphere, especially because the Yard was right there as well.

Happy Hour beware are only at the bar, hightops, or outside. We didn't go for that so it wasn't too big of a deal, but could have been.

Only had the hip bar type food when we were here for a work hang out. It was good from what I had. 

Definitely a fun place to come to hang out and just kick it with friends. Consider it an adult playground."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this place looking at the menu but was I wrong. The deviled eggs were delicious salty and rich. Mussels paired with sausage seemed like a strange pairing but they worked perfectly together. Perfect amount of saltiness with garlic and grilled bread. Absolutely delicious.  Drinks were made with a heavy pour, worth the price. And on top of that service was great. Stephanie was very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"First time having lunch there.  Week day so good crowd from local businesses. In our party  had two salads and the chicken sandwich. Couple of pale ales as well. Great service ~ fast service. great food!  Will come eat there again when in Tempe!"}
{"text":"We were hungry and walked by this restaurant and decided to give it a try. There are only so many times that you can have the 777 at Mr. Lucky's!

They asked us if we wanted to sit outside and we did. Glad we did bc it was a real nice atmosphere with the pool behind me and the unmatchy vintage furniture, I enjoyed it lol

I had their Seared Tuna Salad and it was VERY tasty. In the last few months I've had this salad at other places and I've been so disappointed so it was a nice change for people to give a poop about the quality of their food.

The rest of my company were happy with their food and enjoyed the atmosphere as much as I did. We don't come out this way very often but if we are in the area, we definitely come here again... 777, maybe if I don't have you for a few years I'll come see you again :P"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of co workers on Friday evening. I had very mixed feelings about this place. The pros were definitely the large space (great for events!), easy convenient free parking, tasty drinks, and nice outdoor concept area with games and couches. The cons were the heat and humidity that made sitting in the outdoor area uncomfortable (everyone was soaked in sweat), overpriced food and drinks, and surly staff. My co worker had a dog and was rudely informed by 6 different staff members that dogs weren't allowed. I get it, but you can be a little nicer about it. Not necessary for 6 people to give her a hard time. She ended up leaving immediately because she couldn't stay with the dog. The drinks were very expensive- $10 to $12 for their underwhelming and small cocktails. Tasty but expensive. I had some sangria and it was $8 a glass and delicious but weak. Also very small especially considering how much ice was in the cup. The service was surly and there was a lot of pressure to keep ordering more and more. It was clear that they do not want you to hang out on the couches unless you are quickly and consistently spending lots of money. Again I get it but you can make it a little less known. I would definitely come back but I would manage your expectations with this place. Know what you're getting into. This is not your friendly neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"By pure accident, my husband and I wound up at The Yard last weekend. We were originally planning on eating somewhere else, but that restaurant went on a spontaneous vacation so we had to come up with another game plan. Honestly, it was no hardship since we've wanted to try The Yard since they opened but have been putting it off.

When we arrived, it was around 5pm on a Saturday. Since it was July 4th weekend, the place was packed but not too packed. There was still some valet parking available and some spots on the streets. (The first time I came here, they were so packed we had to park about 10 minutes away and then the wait was over 45 minutes. Needless to say, we didn't stay that time.) When you arrive, you have the choice between dining at Culinary Dropout or Lola's. For this trip, we decided on Culinary Dropout. 

Happy Hour runs from 3-6pm M-F. Since it was a holiday weekend, they extended it to Saturday. During Happy Hour, they have some appetizer deals and $4 well drinks. We decided to order the olives and crusty bread with olive oil dipping sauce. The olives came in a large bowl - they were both delicious and a great deal. The crusty bread was good but I really enjoyed dipping it in my main dish. 

For the main course, my husband ordered the meatloaf and I ordered the sweet potato cannelloni. The meatloaf was extremely tender and flavorful. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. My dish was tasty as well. If you don't know, cannelloni is similar to ravioli except longer rectangular pieces. (I was unaware until the server explained to me.) The cannelloni was stuffed with delicious sweet potato puree then topped with roasted mushrooms, shallots, sweet potato chunks, and fresh snap peas. There was a light parmesan sauce that everything was lightly coated with. (Good bread dipping sauce.)

Overall, the food was pretty good. The location is unique and has an interesting vibe. We didn't check out the actual games area, but the inside was nice with plenty of space for dining. I'm not sure if we will be back since it isn't really in our neighborhood, but it's definitely something to check out if in the area."}
{"text":"Eh, it was OK. I liked the way it was decorated, and my drink (Jalisco something) was good. The food, however, was not impressive at all. I had the grilled cheese sliders, and they weren't any better than I could get at a fast food restaurant. The fries were not very crisp or flavorful either. My husband's burger was tastier than my dinner, but it still wasn't what I was expecting from this restaurant. Our server was just ok, too - made some recommendations for drinks, but then got cranky when our table wasn't ready to order. I had read so many great things about Culinary Dropout, but it was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. EVERY SINGLE ITEM on the menu has been well considered, right down to the wine selections. EVERY SINGLE BITE is first class culinary Nirvana! I savored the entire experience. It is fun and hip, with 5 star food offerings! The service was superb and every single employee was gracious and a pro. 

Not only will I eat there every single time I have an opportunity, it is now on my \"tour\" when we have out of town loved ones to entertain! It's that satisfying! 

Particular favs were the Pub Burger and the Soft Pretzels. Mmmmmmmm perfect! They make delicious cocktails too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here during a business trip based on a recommendation from a local. 

The ambiance is neat. I really enjoyed that you can see the kitchen because of its open design. 

The menu had some interesting items on it. I ordered the Korean Style Shortrib Cap. The flavor in the initial bite was quite delicious. It didn't last throughout the entire plate, however. 

The portion size was OK for a later evening meal. However, if I were eating Dinner at a normal time of night, I would probably have been hungry a few hours later. (I think I needed just a little more balance with carbs). 

Our waiter was quite nice at the initial of the dinner, however he forgot items for the rest of my party. Then he brought items that we didn't order. He seemed distracted, and I never really saw him after he asked how our first taste was. 

Overall... mediocre and not really bad, but not worth the hype. And the parking was annoying. I almost got run over while walking to the door... which is in the rear of the building (in a weird back alley) - weird experience."}
{"text":"I have a broke foot.  When we went for lunch today they tried to seat us at a high top table.  I said no I can't sit at a high top and the girls response was it's this or nothing.   The room was only half full. I could see they just finished cleaning a table.   When I ask I was told they had a reservation for 2:00, it was only 12:30.  Is the service that slow?   We left.  At that point i did not want anything to do with the rude staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the reason I keep staying at the hard rock. If I stayed some where else I'd have to get in a cab to eat here. It's worth having more than once. The fried chicken is best I've ever had. The skin is so good and crispy. The best thing to get though is the shaved prime rib dip sandwich. Other things I've had are the turkey pastrami, it's really good, also the pretzel bread with fondue is great. The captain crunch crusted French toast is yum. Also the drinks here are phenomenal. I recommend the Bloody Mary and the matador. This place knows how to do things well and it's consistently good. Never had a bad thing here."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout has great food, a modern atmosphere, and trendy style. Unfortunately, you should not come here if you do not eat meat. They offer very little options and when asked what non-meat meals they can offer and everything has to be altered. Message to your management: vegetarians and Vegas do not like to alter meals, in order to make it fit their diet. This place would be MUCH better, if they had a more diverse menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and a pre-dinner snack on a Wednesday evening. The place was very trendy and full of beautiful hipsters. I sat at the bar and was served promptly. They had a really interesting cocktail menu as well as a great beer and wine by the glass selection. I ended up getting the Velvet Death which had Death's Door Gin, Velvet Falernum, Lemon, Cointreau and Absinthe. A fantastic cocktail.

I wanted something substantial for a snack but not a real full meal. They had a good selection of cheeses and charcuterie but I was a bit disappointed by their appetizer selection. Seemed to lack substance and favored fried bar items. While it is a gastropub and it looked far more like a traditional restaurant so I was expecting more. 

The sandwiches and entrees looked very promising and I ended up getting a Chicken Hash which was roasted potatoes and sauteed chicken with onions that is covered in a light brown gravy. This is topped with two fried eggs and a bit of shaved truffle. The dish looked amazing and I loved the ingredients. Unfortunately, it lacked flavor. I didn't taste the truffles at all, despite ingesting obvious chunks of them. As a truffle fan this was particularly disappointing. The gravy was also very bland. I wish there would have been a bit more chicken in the chicken hash as well. Very skimpy portions. That being said, the eggs and potatoes were cooked perfectly and were really delicious and saved the dish.

While I only got a small taste of things at Culinary Dropout, it showed real promise. I'd definitely go back and give it another shot. My one concern is that which I had for many \"trendy\" places in Scottsdale in that it is a bit too trendy, clubby and clique-y. Since it was relatively early on a mid-week night and I sat at the bar I was able to get service but I got the feeling that might not be the case all the time.

All in all, the bit of food I had was good (with promise) and the drink was wonderful."}
{"text":"Some of the best drinks I've had. If you like spicy craft cocktails find Matt and ask him to mix you something. Food is solid, nice patio and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout on Valentine's, yes and yes. For V-day, reservations is a must. You could walk-in but seat wait is up in the air. I called 3 days beforehand and luckily I was able to get a 6:45p appointment. 

Food and Atmosphere is top notch. We ordered the pierorgies for appetizers and it was the best. Our first time having pierorgies and we love them now. They were perfectly steamed and then fried a little too give them a bit of crunch. The accoutrements were divine. I wish there were four instead of three for better sharing. For entrees, rainbow trout and the butternut squash \"ravioli.\" I appreciated the trout was pan seared and not breaded. It was a good size too. I subbed the greens beans for brussel sprouts because I was not interested in the typical green bean almondine. They did it. The pasta was good, not too sweet as butternut squash can be sometimes. 

Where the service started fumbling was at the dessert course. The desserts provided are short-listed and to me not really appetizing. I had to get creative and thought about a cheese dessert course. I would think a restaurant that shines a light on its cheese and antipasti would know how to dessert up a cheese. Unfortunately no. The jam provided was sparse and after asking twice for some fruit, my date had to go to the bar and ask for a cup of strawberries. Also, no silverware was provided, and when it was it was a big dinner spoon. It was awkward.

Honorable mention for the live music and some yard games in the back. Also, the dress code was casual with a sprinkle of dressy.

Overall, my date and I were pleased with the experience. V-day, check"}
{"text":"I like this location way better than the Scottsdale location. It's bigger and has more options with the yard next door. Live music with really impressive musicians and it was just right on how loud it was. Corn hole toss and ping pong was really fun to play after dinner and drink more  two bars!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is very popular! The environment here is great :) 
As a appetizer we got pretzels and some amazing cheese dip! 
The \"Room Service\" cocktail was very yummy, a sparkling drink. Make a reservation I can see how this place can get packed. The music is very loud so it was hard to talk with my company. But our server Anali was very sweet! She kept checking up on us and my water never went empty. I would recommend this place to anyone :)"}
{"text":"I stopped in on friday after a bad day and sat at the bar. The bartender was super sweet and had a lot of good suggestions to offer. She was super friendly and honestly made my day better. Would definitely love to come back with a group of friends. Great atmosphere and good food :) I think my bartenders name was Sara."}
{"text":"Yelped this place. Name caught my attention so wanted to check it out. Also the reviews about the fried chicken were good and I couldn't wait to try. Drinks were on point. Tried the classic Mule. Piece of candied ginger was a nice touch. They had a build your own charcuterie platter which was interesting and great selection of cheeses and meats. Can be pricey though. I had the most perfect fried chicken with mash potatoes. Chicken was drizzled with a little bit of honey. My friend had the mini grilled cheese sandwich and it was good. Live band started up right when we were leaving."}
{"text":"Walked in to find this place DEAD (I guess Monday nights are slow...), so my friends and I got a table quick. 

Ordered a half dozen oysters to start. They could have been cleaned a bit better, I had more than a few with some serious grit in them. And I know there's always going to be SOME grit and sand, but this probably could have been remedied with another rinse or two. Good sauce accompanies it, though. Just be conservative with it, the oysters taste delicious on their own. 

I had the meatloaf. It didn't taste as good as my mom's (but, really, does it ever, people?) but it was actually better than I was expecting. A solid, well-formed loaf, not too spongy, nice firmness. Seasoning was mild, not too heavy as to take away the taste of the meat. 

It came with green beans, which were extremely underdone. Better than overdone, but I found it odd they'd serve them like that; didn't complement the dish at all. I think it also came with mashed potatoes. The fact I can't remember likely means the other side dish was innocuous enough that it went down good but wasn't worth storing in my mind."}
{"text":"Oh boy. I did it again. I tried one of those uber-trendy downtown Scottsdale eateries. Which resulted in mixed feelings.

Atmosphere was a bit frenzied to me. I don't think that is what they are going for but it wasn't very relaxing.

Our server was very personable and helpful with the menu.

Our cocktails were amazing. Pricey but worth every penny. My husband had a whiskey drink and I had a gin drink. Forgot the names but they were awesome and extremely creative.

We started out with the pretzels and cheese fondue. Oh so good. Piping hot salty fluffy pillows of pretzel dipped in gooey, delicious cheese fondue. And a huge portion... enough for about 4 people. It's good that the portion was big because of what happened next...

I ordered the chopped vegetable salad. The menu says it contains corn, avocado, artichoke, asparagus, pistachios, and Parmesan. I was envisioning something similar to the chopped salad at Cowboy Ciao as far as vegetable content. What I got was mostly lettuce, a little bit of asparagus, corn, and pistachios, some beets (which was not mentioned on the menu and I can't stand), and barely any dressing and Parmesan. Absolutely no avocado or artichoke. Trust me I spent 10 minutes picking through the salad looking at it. 

In the server's defense he offered to bring me another salad which I declined. I filled up on pretzels while picking through my salad and I was already full. He offered to bring me a free dessert which again I declined because of my pretzel filled belly. 

My husband's grilled cheese sliders were passable. Good fries. 

My gripes are with the kitchen who completely missed two key ingredients... to a hungry vegetarian this is a sin. Also with management. I only ate 1/4 of the salad. I didn't want a new one or dessert. I paid $12 for a bowl of lettuce. The salad being comped should have been a given. And trust me I am not a complainer as most of my reviews are 4 or 5 stars.

All that being said, I do really want to give CD another try. Their drinks were exquisite and judging by the pretzels I know they probably have some other good menu items up their sleeve... but their chopped vegetable salad isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is a cool little restaurant in the Hard Rock Hotel - something that isn't too bad to stop by if you're feeling too tired/lazy to leave the hotel.  

When you first get into Culinary Dropout, you find a pretty spacious restaurant surprisingly after you enter.  Their bar/beer draft selection is also pretty plentiful with PBR, Fat Tire and more.  I had the meatloaf which was recommended by a couple Yelpers - not a bad choice as it was of a pretty good size but not the best.  Some of my coworkers had the burgers which were fantastic according to them.  The cannelloi was also supposed to be pretty good but be warned, it was pretty small and not filling.  

There was also a pretty good live musician playing on the front stage - the poor guy was playing to a 1/2-empty restaurant on a Sunday night but hey, still did a good job playing in general.  

The aesthetic was pretty nice with a full bar and bar seating, some nice tables and some other seats scattered about.  Don't expect for quiet conversation inside as the music is put up pretty loud.  There were also some cool fire pits right outside - wasn't sure if it was part of the restaurant but seemed nice if you wanted to go outside or have a nice moment with your significant other.  

Culinary Dropout wasn't completely wow-worthy but all-around was a strong restaurant in it's food, aesthetics and cool little bonuses.  Kudos."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and cocktails ($10). Outside games. Live music. Great place for a party."}
{"text":"Great live band this evening.  Server was awesome,
bouncers were super, hostess was fabulous too.
It was LOUD.  It was Saturday evening so that could be a huge contributing factor.  
Fun atmosphere.
Tasty looking options on the menu.  I had the Deviant Behavior along with the Tuna Salad and my son went with an Apple Shandy and the Trout.  Both entrees were delicious and beverages refreshing. We shared the custard for dessert and maybe cuz I noshed on Carmel corn at the DBG just before coming could contribute to my lack of enthusiasm for this dessert.
Like this place but don't feel like I fit in on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was great! Atmosphere was amazing! Try the pretzel dippers and grilled asparagus (ask for it hot). This was the only plus to staying at the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"This was my second adventure at a Culinary Dropout location having previously been to the one in Scottsdale a couple of times. The Tempe location adds a completely different vibe but has the same delicious food and bar drinks. With a large outdoor area filled with bar games, tons of TVs, rooms for having meetings/parties and an indoor/outdoor bar set up its perfect for anyone looking to have a great night out! I don't have a specific favorite item on the menu but every bar snack we ordered was fabulous. Try the fried chicken or the prime rib dip, the pretzel bites, snack boards, heck just order one of everything on the menu. The atmosphere in my opinion is perfect for what I look for in a restaurant. Catering to my need for sports, well made drinks/food and great service Culinary Dropout wherever the location, is my favorite place to go in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I wish I would have written this review a lot sooner because the rest of the night while super fun is somewhat of a blur. Located in amazing Old Town Scottsdale, Culinary dropout brings a Vegas type theme restaurant to Arizona. Great food, DJ spinning the tunes, amazing servers, a fantastic outdoor seating area and a single guy's dream of ladies everywhere. We were so focused on the eat of the night we just ordered a few appetizers and a ton of drinks. While I don't remember exactly what I had I can tell you it was still delicious. Their signature cocktails are outstanding and the dinner menu did look fantastic. There are 3 Culinaries in the area so choose wisely based on where you want to go afterwards. Can't wait to come back and actually try the dinner menu!! Thanks for a great night!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! They offer a variety of choices but not an overwhelming amount. We had the pretzels with fondue...Amazing! My husband had the green chile stew & it was so good, I could have eaten a gallon of it. I had the Italian grinder with the salad, the sandwich was huge and yummy, but the side salad was probably the best side salad I have ever had, it made me wish I had forgone the sandwich & just ordered the full salad. We also had banana cream pie and a couple of very yummy and strong cocktails, names are escaping me, pistol something & dove something, both were delicious and we would recommend.  Overall we would suggest you eat at Culinary Drop Out and we will come again when we travel to the area."}
{"text":"Good service great fun but I didn't get to play ping pong because of the rain and when it stopped they didn't want to open it up."}
{"text":"Pricey but the food is so yummy and the atmosphere is really fun! They also are very customer service oriented and honor coupons very well. Definitely a fun place for a night out with friends! Pretzels are so yummy and a crowd favorite and the meatloaf is to die for! My only complaint are the prices but the quality makes it worth it for every once in a while!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection. Pork ribs are a MUST. Had manchego as an appetizer - was not too impressed, it tasted like it sat in the fridge for too long. Other than that it is definitely worth checking out. Play some ping pong, enjoy your drink, have fun and finish it up with a delicious rack of ribs."}
{"text":"I love Culinary Dropout for apps and drinks. Their happy hour isn't the best but it's the only way this place is affordable for me (happy hour also ends at 5 which restricts the amount of times I even come). Happy hour doesn't include the specialty drinks, just house liquors, so I usually end up with sangria. It's got a great cool atmosphere, I've had good service, and the apps are awesome. My favorite is the chips and onion dip, that onion dip tastes so fresh! The actual full meals here aren't worth the price. Salad, fish and chips, and meatloaf are some of the full meals I've had and I've never been impressed."}
{"text":"HRH Las Vegas is my home away from home and gastropubs are my go-to so it makes Culinary Dropout a perfect spot for me. They have a huge outdoor patio facing one of the pools and a nice bar that faces the patio. Great service from the bartenders as well, they know their stuff!

They have a decent craft beer selection, a great cocktail menu and good food. I've only been here a few times but have liked pretty much everything I have tried. They have a great raw bar with just about anything you'd want in the shellfish category. The burgers are good, the small plate menu is nice for light apps and the pretzel fondue is a must-try! (you can get it half off during Happy Hour too). Speaking of happy hour, they have $3 mug beer which includes their craft beer on tap. If you're in Vegas, check it out."}
{"text":"The Korhan Style Ribeye Cap is the best steak I have ever had!  Great ambiance, love the patio, I recommend sitting outside!  Perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is one of my favorite places to go for happy hour. The Pretzels and Fondue are SO good and the charcuterie plate on the happy hour menu is a great deal. Other than happy hour, the rest of their menu is great too. The Grinder is really yummy, so are the Grilled Cheese Sliders. The best cocktail there is the Smashed Irishman (not on happy hour, but delicious!). Atmosphere is very stylish and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"A family favorite of ours. I recently took some New York colleagues of mine in the Art world, clearly accustomed to nothing but the best, and they absolutely loved the food and ambience. They thanked me a dozen times for such a unique experience for a business dinner"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and drinks are superb. Loved the pickled peppers and Brussels sprouts. The decor is really cool as well as the employees."}
{"text":"Food is very good and servers are nice. I think the hostesses are hit or miss as I have been here a few times. Haven't had anything I wouldn't recommend.
Overall a very good restaurant."}
{"text":"Brunch review: service was great - and it usually is at any of The Yard venues. I'm giving this a 3 star rating because of the brunch menu. I had the breakfast sandwich and it was good, not amazing. My friend had the yogurt and that looked yummy! My other friend had the breakfast burrito and he was not impressed. My biggest surprise was the price for a mimosa - $7.25?! They bout offer bottle mimosas or bottomless. It's my fault for inquiring on the price but I also never expected it to be that much. Sangria was $4. 

I've visited culinary drop out plenty - my ratings are that lunch is great, dinner is very good, and brunch is just fine. 

It's still a great environment and a fun place!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The service is excellent and the food was fantastic. We had Cory as our server, and he was not only incredibly knowledgable about the food and how it's prepared, but he cracked us up and made us laugh throughout dinner without disrupting the flow of the meal and our evening out with friends. He was there when we needed him but also wasn't in our faces and unnecessarily interruptive. I would definitely recommend Culinary Dropout to any foodies looking to check out a new option or return to a really solid restaurant. We were very impressed and will return for sure!"}
{"text":"I've dined here a handful of times and each experience was subpar.

I love the ambiance, design, indoor/outdoor seating options, but the food does very little for my taste buds and each time has taken 40+ minutes for my Husband and I to receive our food. Mind you, I am very understanding, but there were no more than 14 other customers, max, so I couldn't comprehend the long wait. 

With that being said, the deviled eggs are delicious!! 

I'm rooting for this establishment to up their game, as I'd really like them to succeed and revisit upon them making several improvements."}
{"text":"Really good food, and great atmosphere.  Solid beer tap list, everything I would expect from a great New American-style restaurant. Service was average, but adequate."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout has a fun and energetic atmosphere for a nice night out. The inside seating can be a little too noisy, especially depending on your party size. However, I sat outside with a group of % and it was very nice. I have only been once but everyone at my table all ordered different things and each person enjoyed their meal thoroughly. The prices are what I expected since it is located by Fashion Square in Scootsdale. The service was decent. The server seemed to have a slight attitude which always bothers me because I used to be a server and am nothing but nice to the staff at restaurants. Howver, they have a fairly extensive bar menu so i cannot wait to go back for happy hour! Fox restaurants never seem to disappoint me!"}
{"text":"AMAZING cheeseburger! I'm talking AMAZING! And the pretzels were to die for! Super unique artichoke-- very smokey! I'd say all in all I'm DEFINITELY a fan of the food. Service however, pretty lacking... it's really too bad. For one, the server had NO knowledge of all of the beers they offered-- pretty sad considering that is sort of half the reason they exist. And then once the food hit our table we never saw the server again. We had to ask multiple other servers (who we thought we servers, but no one wear uniforms here-- sort of a \"cool\" place) in order to get our check. But man the food is good!"}
{"text":"I love the Phoenix location so I had to try out the Tempe location. We had a 45 minute wait for Sunday at 1:30 pm which was a bummer. The hostess would not even make eye contact with me when I was trying to setup a seat. We waited and finally got in but they forgot the high chair. We got the high chair and put in our drink order which took 20 minutes to get back. Then we ordered food and that came in another 20 minutes and so we ordered another drink and it took another 30 minutes. We did not leave the place until close to 4 pm. Our waitress was not concerned about our wait but it was very disappointing to wait forever. The food was okay but the fries were totally burnt. Not sure if I will be back to this location again."}
{"text":"Amazing and super fun! This place was packed but we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table at their busy time of night on a Saturday. The crowd was very hip and the atmosphere was fun. We sat there for at least two hours grazing on antipasto tray and pretzels with cheese dip. I found a new bear that I love and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pretty fucking disgusting. They should put as much effort in the food as the decor, then it'd be great. Had the fish n chips, you'd think you couldn't mess that up right? Wrong. It left a really bad taste in my mouth, fish was soggy and tasteless. Really disgusting. The only reason I came here was because pink taco was closed. You're better off eating mcdonalds lol"}
{"text":"This place sucks.  Go to Thirsty Lion instead.  If you want the summary, watch the South Park episode on SodaSopa.  Dueche bartenders will slightly different hipster outfits that think their mixed drinks are special.  Came from Denver for spring training and really disappointed.  Manager should visit Denver and learn how to treat the hipsters and norms equally.

Today after reading this review, I realized my review missed the key points.  Yes this place is a hipster bar.  It's probably a hot spot for it but the problems were the bartenders were total a-holes.  When asked what I wanted, I said \"I think we'll have...\" only to be stopped and asked \"do you think or do you know?\"  I only got one drink in an hr period because 1 bartender spent the majority of the time cleaning mixing cups and other 2 spent the majority avoiding me probably because I was wearing a t-shirt and sandals vs. a flamingo button up shirt w salmon shorts, a vest and a fedora."}
{"text":"My favorite place to take our out-of-town friends and family when they come for a visit. Very enjoyable and unique cool atmosphere, specialty cocktails and good beer selection, and food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the dining room was great. Live music, lots of space, and a ton of natural lighting. Too bad it's on the east side as it would be my go to lunch spot. Everything we ordered was delicious, but the fries stood out. I would recommend to everyone looking for a relaxed lunch/brunch."}
{"text":"This was my third experience with Culinary Dropout but my first at this location. We arrived early because we were headed to Gammage auditorium for a musical afterward. The small bites and entrees were delicious, as usual. I asked the waiter which of two salads I should have and he suggested the antipasto salad, which was excellent; my husband, a Brit, had the fish and chips, which he enjoyed. He tasted my salad and enjoyed it so much that he said he would order it--coming from a meat and potatoes guy! We had deviled eggs and chicarones for small bites and they were also delicious. The server was very friendly and helpful. This location is huge and noisy compared to Scottsdale but we will come back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a group!  Large and loaded with fun activities corn hole and other yard games.  Food is delicious and reasonable!  Good portions!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant across from the Fashion Square Mall in Scottsdale Riverfront. The overall ambiance and setting is more than warm and welcoming. I loved the industrial look with huge chandeliers and high loft ceilings. Kind of loud but energetic and fun. 

We sat at the bar since we wanted to take advantage of happy hour (Happy hour is only offered at the bar area). They offer Happy hour MON-FRI from 3 to 6 pm.  Food was good and cocktails (Great Moscow Mules and Moonshine Apple pie flavor shots) were even better. Our Bartender was super friendly and took care of us greatly. 

The pretzels with warm fondue were to die for!!! MUST TRY....Huge portion and meant to be shared :-)
I also tried the smoked salmon bruschetta, It was just okay nothing too special about it
I also had the Seared ahi tuna salad, it was yummy with a perfect amount of ginger dressing and wasabi peas without over powering the salad. 

Next time I am in Scottsdale I will be back for more."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! It was the best place to stop by for bottomless mimosas and delicious food after a girls trip to Vegas. 

Sean, our waiter, was amazing! He was super friendly and made time to go over the menu with us! His recommendations were amazing! The soft pretzels with fondue provolone cheese was delicious! Also, loved the Captain Crunch French toast! 

Definitely will be coming back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Went tonight which is Monday we arrived at 6:30 pm, no reservations and luckily we were seated inside right away. Food was great and staff very attentive. Our waiter explained some of the items on the menu \"jamon Iberico\" and made some great suggestions. I had the gorgonzola chicken salad which was delicious, my friend had the crispy shrimp caesar salad but had them blacken the shrimp instead of fry it, my 20 y/o nephew had the grilled chicken club sandwich which was piled high with meat ! Non rushed atmosphere the front doors were open so nice breeze. Heard it could get loud and hard to hear conversations, probably related to high ceilings and wooden floors, but we didn't find it loud tonight. There were some empty tables inside so not extremely busy. Enjoyed the evening and will return again !!"}
{"text":"Food was cold. Terrible service. We were here for over an hour. Manager looked pissed off that we had complaints. Not one to complain but this was very bad. One of my friends is lactose intolerant and they gave her cheese anyway. Took 30 minutes to bring her a new burger out. Don't come here if you can avoid it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Very good atmosphere and would be a good place to come and hang out! I got the fish and chips which was the best I've ever had. Their banana cream pie was phenomenal as well. I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a nice surprise. I saw the shrimp and pork belly ramen and I was hooked. The place looks great inside. The band was an added touch. The staff was amazing. And we loved our food so much we didn't want to share with each other. This is a great date night location but comfortable enough to bring your child which is a must for us."}
{"text":"If you're staying at the Hard Rock, don't hesitate to eat here! Great food, service and my favorite, being outside pool-side. 
At a table of 6, we all got different dishes and were happy. The nachos, a must! Our waiter, Matt was very attentive, helpful and efficient! I wish this place was in Cleveland, cause I'd be a regular!"}
{"text":"Fox Restaurant Concepts is a master of design and ambiance, but I find the food overpriced for the quantity and quality, and the staff undertrained.

I was with a party of 6 and we ordered cocktails and asked for water. The drinks came within a reasonable amount of time, but it took 45 minutes (and several \"I'll be back with those waters\" from our server) to get any water at our table. You know the feeling when you try to desperately ask your server for something because you can tell you won't see them again for a while? That was our experience.

I ordered the Korean rib eye steak which was very tasty, but I don't think the portion on my plate was even a full 8oz of beef. Also, it was already cut? Part of the joy of ordering a steak is cutting it! Basically, it was served like fajitas... Not what I was expecting, I guess.

Maybe we were the unlucky table with the 1 not-so-good server, but it leaves an impression you know? Like bringing us our bills with not a SINGLE pen! Hello?! To top it all off, valet brought back my truck and there were blotches of some mysterious white substance on my windshield, my passenger window, and all over the bed. So bizarre!

I'm not a negative person, and it pains me to leave a negative review for a local AZ chain, but I feel let down."}
{"text":"This is a definite gastropub with a chic gothic rocker vibe.  The decor is a mixture of wood, velvet, and metal. I'd come here to just sit and stare in awe at the fabulous decor and details, like the huge chandeliers...but I'd easily get distracted with the enticing food and drink options on their menu.  

Me and the boyfriend also came here to eat and drink while visiting a friend in Scottsdale. For appetizers we ordered the potato chips and mussels which were both good. It wasn't until we finished off the food before I realized everyone around us ordered the pretzel fondue...oops!  Next time that'll be on the to-do list!  Needless to say we filled our bellies with drinks and finished off our night with some ooey gooey apple monkey bread :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I went here and got their fish and chips and deviant behavior and loved every minute of it."}
{"text":"Food was fine but we have never felt so rushed in our lives.  We ordered 6 oysters to start, pork belly nachos and then our mains.  Yes a lot of food but we were looking forward to a nice enoyable evening of good food and a couple of drinks.  All of the food came out at once!  When we mentioned this to our server that our mains were getting cold he shrugged and said that he would send over the Manager.  Well that made it worse as this manager proceeded to tell us that this is how restaurants work and couldn't believe we had an issue.  He actually made the situation worse.  Too bad. ..the food was decent but the night was ruined and the food wasted."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is real cool.

I was in vegas for a bachelor party and had to head up 19 dudes and was looking for a chill place to dine and all I did was pull up opentable with the parameters of dinner at 8 pm for a party of 20. Culinary dropout fit the bill with nice open seating, patio area to lounge and even live music. I chose the perfect spot. Kudos to me and yelp of course.

We all arrived on time and were seated immediately. As I said there was live music being performed which was on point. Just as a word of warning I was slightly inebriated for most of the night, but not enough to lose my memory and make an accurate account for this review.

Folks in my party were ordering beers on tap and other alky drinks. They came promptly and the drinkfest continued. Upon reading the reviews of this place beforehand the pretzels with fondue cheese were spoken highly of so the whole table got orders of that and it was bomb. I asked the waiter what he recommended on the menu and he pointed out that the most bang for buck dish was the fried chicken and that sold me. It was good but not mind blowing. There were three pieces; leg, thigh, and breast with a honey glazed biscuit, mashed potatoes and cole slaw. A massive dish indeed. Alky and greasy food go hand in hand.

The service was fantastic and the vibe and ambiance is well suited for big parties."}
{"text":"When we come here we always have a great time! The atmosphere and food is great. This place is awesome! It's a great place to hangout and relax. Staff is friendly and will go out of their way to get you what you need!"}
{"text":"I felt a tad sick after eating the mussels dish here. It had fantastic flavor, though, so I feel bad knocking it.

-The chicken chili was awesome, definitely recommend.
-Shrimp ramen was good, but I'd like to see a little more bold flavor (spice?) in there, or at least the option of hoisin/lime/sriracha added.
-Coworker got the ribs and said they came apart in weird pieces and weren't ideal."}
{"text":"Never fails to impress!  This is my go-to restaurant for Friday nights in Phoenix.  And I always love to take friends for the first time.  Our service was spotty, but the atmosphere was fantastic.  Live music that night was awesome."}
{"text":"Wish it was closer to my side of town or the opened a store in Westgate (hint hint). Great food, great atmosphere and excellent service."}
{"text":"I'm writing this in between throwing up from eating here.  I had the oysters around 830. I came up to my room to get ready and got a huge sharp pain in stomach. I spent the next hours on the toilet. Had to cancel my plans and am still sick."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place because I wasn't very impressed with one of its sister restaurants. Alas, we had gift cards so we decided to check it out.

First, the atmosphere is really neat. I absolutely loved the covered patio and think it would be an awesome place for a large group. They also had some games to play and the vibe was really good. 

The service was excellent. The waiter was friendly and our interactions felt genuine and not forced. He was attentive, but not overbearing. Exactly what you want in a waiter.

Now the food...this is the other half of the equation. We tried the prickly pear cider, which was sooo good and left me feeling pretty buzzed after half of a glass. I miiight be outing myself as a bit of a lightweight by saying that, but it definitely has some alcohol to it. We also tried the pretzel fondue and the nachos, both of which were absolutely awesome. We also ordered the shrimp kale caesar salad and the french dip, and both were delicious. I will definitely be back here, probably with a big group, and will eat my heart out again. I cant wait for the one in downtown Gilbert to open up as well!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to give Emily the manager major credit. My family and I came in for my sisters birthday and there was a misunderstanding when we first arrived and we were on our way to another restaurant. Once Emily discovered this, she went above and beyond to make sure we stayed and apologized so professionally. We all appreciated the effort made and will definitely be back because of it- THAT is what customer service is all about."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the hip decor, the great food, and the wonderful service. The Turkey Pastrami on a pretzel roll with melted swiss cheese and cole slaw was delicious. Great fries on the side, too. We started with the housemade potato chips and famous onion dip--I highly recommend it. The outdoor dining area looked comfortable with misters, but it was 108 degrees outside, which was OK for some, but not someone from the beach."}
{"text":"Best asset of this place: Matt the sassy ginger bar tender 

Makes bomb drinks and will tell you about his adventures"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Big windows open, nice cross breeze. Servers are nice. Service is fast. Pretzel and fondue cheese is amazing. Fish and chips were good but a little on the greasy side. Fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy was incredible. Friend had the sweet corn ravioli. She said it was delicious. But the portion size for the pasta was on the lighter side. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 3 times
Love hanging out at the bar and relaxing with my husband enjoying happy hour. Love the pretzel fondue
Cheese board and mussels. All recommend by my favorite bartender Chris. He is sweet, attentive and 
always friendly"}
{"text":"Service was Excellent! Flew in from Washington and was having dinner with my uncle and aunt who live in the area. I had a few questions about the menu and the waiter had great suggestions or feedback.  Very trendy spot playing hot hits from the 80s-90s. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Service sucked! From the minutes we sat at the bar to wait for the rest of our party, took 10 minutes to get a drink! The restaurant was half full, so getting a table for seven on a Wednesday wasn't a problem. Sat there for five or more minutes before anyone came to out table, fifteen minutes for drinks, ten minutes later gave our order, food came out nice and hot. Sat for the longest time with empty plates in front of us, fifteen minutes to get one to go box. Ordered dessert then, twenty minutes later it finally arrived.  Funny how they finally hop to when they bring the bill! Food was very good, no complaints there, but seriously if you want to watch the help chat each other up go here, because that's what happened to us."}
{"text":"Food was great at lunch, not too crowded. Server was in no hurry to cash us out though."}
{"text":"Showed up at 7:30 pm on Easter , the waitress we had showed us the beer and drink menu , but when asking upon the rotating beers she had to check and look them up. She didn't come back for at least 20 minutes while seated at the bar to order food and when asking another bartender to order he said he would let our server know, yet he did nothing. Food was late and bread was stale, won't go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a very enjoyable lunch. Upon arrival we'll were quickly seated and greeted by Tori our server. She was very pleasant and catered to all of our requests in a timely and professional manner. We ordered deviled eggs and sherry glazed beets as appetizers. They were quite tasty however, the beets were very sweet, probably better served as a desert. For our entrees my wife had the home made butternut squash cannellonie and I had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, biscuit and cole slaw. The fried chicken was excellent and I highly recommend it. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her lunch as well. It was pleasureable experience, definitely worth a trip back"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant/bar. I came here on a Friday with a couple of friends for drinks. The space is very cute, nice couches inside, open kitchen, great bar, and an awesome outside space with fire pits. We sat at the bar until we noticed the fire pits and big comfy chairs. 
We moved over outside and our bartender, Dylan was accommodating enough to continue taking care of us while we went out. Must say, he's a great bartender! Accommodating, fun, and most of all makes delicious drinks. 
Cocktails I had: Deviant behavior - comes with a side of Belgian white beer. Not my favorite, I'm not a fan of cocktails with beer I guess; Monkey See, Monkey Do - delicious! It has rum and pineapple, among other things, really good! Pomegranate Yuzu Mule - my favorite drink, so freaking good! I subbed vodka for gin (he is not my friend), it comes with yuzu sour, pomegranate juice, and fresh pomegranates on top. 
We also tried their potatoes chips which were pretty good. My friends loved them.
I really enjoyed our time here, next time I come I will make sure I'm hungry so I can try some of the food. The food menu looks very promising."}
{"text":"We came here for my sister's bachelorette party dinner, a group of about 15. We had reservations, but when we arrived, it was incredibly busy. We waited nearly an hour before another member of the party politely talked to the management. We were quickly seated after, and the restaurant more than made good with a few complimentary appetizers and drinks. The food was fantastic, and I was really pleased with how they rectified the situation."}
{"text":"Ehh, overall it was okay.  I ordered the honey fried chicken and it was pretty good. They do give the disclaimer that it takes a while, and it truly did take a long time lol.  I didn't finish the biscuit. It looked very appeasing, but the taste didn't meet the standard. I also ordered the pink margarita, but was advised that they'd run out of the pink flavor; only to see other patrons get the same drink, with the flavor they allegedly ran out of ?.  I was excited about going, because I heard/read raving reviews about yesterday's soup, but they only had tomato bisque.. I'll pass. The ambiance was amazing, hence my higher rating.  They have areas for private dining, which I thought was really nice as well. Would I go again.? No, but it was a nice experience while on vacation."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place. Love the food here! I've liked everything that I have tried from here so far. Service is pretty good but it does get pretty crowded during lunch times and ofcourse at night. 
There are some games you can play out in the yard-like area. Pretty fun!
My complain is about forced vallet parking. I wish they had a self-park area. If u want to self-park you will have to park out on the street. 
Overall I've had good experiences and recommend it!"}
{"text":"The only reason they don't get 5 stars is the wait is just too long on most weekends and their front of house staff doesn't seem Johnny on The Spot all the time.  The food is always great.  We've had the fried chicken-which is rockin!  It's moist and flavorful.  I love the gravy they serve with it.  We've also had the trout and pasta dishes that are very good.  We also love the fondue with pretzels and the House potato chips and dip.  I could take a bath in the dip it's THAT awesome.  Live music on Fridays is great too.  I love the decor in the place too."}
{"text":"Great beverage options and the outdoor space with couches are perfect for relaxing with friends!  Be sure to grab some pretzels to go with your bloody mary."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this place is incredible! Ask for Maggie as your server! Easily the best service I've ever received!"}
{"text":"We waited twice as long as we were told the wait would be for seating while there were plenty of open tables.  That was the theme of the night...waiting.  Getting a drink delivered took a minimum of two asks and would take 20-30 minutes.  Our food took nearly an hour.  The manager came over and offered to pay for a round of drinks and desserts but we didn't want to wait around further for deserts.  The food itself was good but the service was so awful I would not return.  The location by Fashion Square Mall is great."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks!!!!! I wanted to try every drink on the menu.  The food is so tasteful as well. Can't skip dessert, yummy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend found this gem while browsing date night options for us! It's two restaurants combined so it gives it a very vastly huge look! Complimentary valet was a win! We were quickly seated and waited on. The live music was entertaining and relaxing. I ordered the MAC burger with fries and he got the fried chicken. Both entrees were delicious (huge portions though so we could barely finish it). Pretzels were the closest thing to heaven on earth (must always order those). I had the between you and me drink and he had a Manhattan... We each ordered 3 drinks a piece because they were that great. We will certainly return!!! Nailed it!"}
{"text":"Continue to love this place, the food and staff!
Spent my night at the bar with Britta at the bar, she suggested the \"you and me\" drink and it is now my favorite drink! cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"Other than the pretzel dipped in cheese, the food was horrible. They try way too hard to be original and it hurts the food. Stick with the pretzels....they were actually great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food! The Korean Brussels sprouts were a big hit as were the 36 hour pork ribs. My son enjoyed the grilled cheese sliders and my wife the Ahi salad.  Everything was top notch!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with the kids on Sunday.  Amazing food, check out he ribs and the fry chicken."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends prior to seeing Magic Mike Live. If you have a large party, I encourage you to reserve in advance online.

The dark ambiance and live music certainly was lifting the mood for my friend birthday. 

Suggest trying: Soft Pretzels Provolone Fondue, BBQ Pork Belly Nachos, Gorgonzola Chicken Salad, Roasted Salmon, Chocolate S'mores Pudding, and the King Crab Legs."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. I don't understand why this place was packed. Not even worth happy hour prices. Nice service though. I got salmon bruchetta - they said no mayo, but doubtful and maybe 2 small slivers of smoked salmon swimming in white sauce. Chopped salad was a thoughtless concoction of random ingredients."}
{"text":"Solid food with great atmosphere.  Live music was a nice touch, and the volume wasn't deafening.  The most popular dish among diners was the pretzel and cheese fondue.  I think half of the restaurant ordered the pretzel, but we decided against it.  I was happy to see Jamon Iberico on the menu.  I did not get the hint of fruitiness, but it might not be the more prized Bellota given the price.  Overall, I think Culinary Dropout is a good option for causal dining."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere/ambiance/service.  Super location, so glad to see something cool go on that corner!"}
{"text":"Came here with some work contacts for lunch after a meeting as it was recommended by one of them. Being that I just had Cheesecake Factory for lunch the day before, I wanted to order something that was flavorful and satisfying yet not overly filling and packed with a bunch of calories. Enter the Italian Chopped Salad! What a fantastic blend of meats and veggies in small pieces that as an entire composition was entirely what I was looking for. I left lunch that day with my hunger adequately put at bay and enough energy left to perform my regular after-work run in the evening. I will definitely be back when I am up in the Scottsdale area!

PS: -1 star for the lack of drink selection. They only had 2 types of tea -- black and black with passion fruit."}
{"text":"Whenever we are in Las Vegas, Culinary Dropout is one of our favorite restaurants to go to. The food (especially the fried chicken) is amazing. And the service is spectacular. Part of the reason we always come back is because of Matt... he's a great bartender with a sparkling personality who always makes our Culinary experience five star."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!!!! I was a fan of the Scottsdale location so my expectations were really high. This Tempe location is definitely on par. The space is very spacious and beautiful warehouse chic. It is kinda dark in the evening, but has romantic lighting. Now on to the food parts! Our table ordered an assortment of appetizers. The Pork Belly Nachos (more please), the Parmesan Brussel sprouts (yes!), some charcuterie (cheese & meats oh my!). My main entree was the ramen. Very good!! The service was excellent. I had my 9 month old with me, and the servers were very attentive and friendly with her and brought our her food right away. Even though I live closer to the Scottsdale location, I can't wait to return to this one very soon. The only thing that need improving is the parking situation, but in time I am sure it will be less confusing."}
{"text":"I love this place! If you haven't been to Culinary Dropout yet, What are you waiting for?
I am a repeat offender of this joint and have had almost everything on the menu. The space is well designed and decorated, but it's pretty dark inside. It's also a nice touch with the open kitchen. There is one chef with an amazingly fierce Mo'hawk. On my most recent visit, I had the Fried Chicken. Not really a fried chicken fan, but it was delicious. It was basically half a Chicken accompanied with buttermilk biscuits. Now let's talk drinks. There are some pretty creative drinks on the menu.My favorite is Whiskey based Smashed Irishman. Some days of the weeks this place can get really loud from the live bands they feature."}
{"text":"I have been here on 3 different occasions over the past few years and never been disappointed. Great open air ambiance, live music on weekends, and reliable food. You must start with the pretzels and provolone fondue (but, be careful, it's easy to fill up on!). The sandwiches and entrees are also hearty but made with fresh ingredient. Service has been spot on too. Will definitely continue to visit on future Vegas weekends!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The name is kind of a reminder to me that it was ok for me to drop out of high school. I can relate to the person that dropped out because it really takes a lot of courage. I am glad the drop out who made this restaurant is doing well and is glad about their decision. Although, for me, I am currently working to start-up a company. The profits are coming in slow but I am doing something I love. I have had a passion for tarot cards since my ex fiancé from Guam was a part of my life. It gave me strength and I wish to begin my business successfully. Having known another drop out, it gives me hope and inspires me to do this!"}
{"text":"Clients from Canada were in town and took out to dinner!  Great place to relax and also not too too loud to be able to have a conversation.  Second time here and I took the advice of our amazing waitress of what to order, whose name I have forgotten but I was able to compliment her to her GM.  We ordered apps and entrees and I had the sweet corn raviolis and they were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Went for my friend's birthday dinner and had a great experience overall with food and service. We order a few different appetizers:

Pretzels bits with provolone fondue cheese 5/5 stars
Thai chili chicken wings 5/5)stars  
House potato chips w/ onion dip 4/5 stars 
'Yesterday's soup' (chili) 3/5 

Rib plate 3/5 
Fried Chicken 3/5 
Fish and chips 4/5 
sweet corn ravioli 4/5 
Shaved prime rib dip 3/5 
Pork belly nachos 3/5"}
{"text":"Stopped by here as we were driving home to CA. The reviews were great and thought we would try it out. 
Such a cool place and we all loved our food. Ahi salad, grilled cheese sliders, yesterday's soup (sausage kale), Mac n cheese... the pretzel and cheese side is a MUST! I could have only had that and been content. Staff was amazing and we will be back next time we're rollin' through!! And we had our 4 kids with us (1,3, 6 & 8). Which makes it a plus that it was kid-friendly!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. I hear its fun on weeknights. But don't bother coming on the weekend. Especially for a birthday. They'll have you wait two or more hours for a table even though the promise you an hour to hour and a half. They'll say you're next on the list but continually seat people before you. Lame. Gotta love being lied to and having your friend's birthday party being basically ruined."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere.  Great place to go with a large group of friends, girls night out, a date or with my kids.  It's fun and comfortable all year round.  I always get the pinot noir on tap, which is a relatively decent wine and a good price.  It's a Fox Concepts restaurant, so you can count on that consistency of good quality.  Food is fine, though I wouldn't call it a great value or innovative.  Trendy, yes, and better than bar food, and ideal when food is not your main concern.  I am a fan, indeed."}
{"text":"Everything our table ordered was delicious. It's got a cool, open vibe inside the Yard building. The fried chicken was so juicy and flavorful, it didn't need hot sauce. The pretzel bun app, and turkey pastrami were both top notch. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"top notch food and service in an industrial design setting. Had a party of 7 and got seated right away. It had something for everyone of the foodies in my group. Consider ordering family style and sharing. Good vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. So stinking good.  Great variety of speciality drinks and the food is fantastic. I've devoured a lot on their menu. The pretzels /fondue are ridiculous. The pastrami is salty goodness, and the Asian salad is INSANE."}
{"text":"OMG.  I'm so jealous I don't leave anywhere near this place.  The one in Scottsdale is fine, but this place is fantastic.  Imagine a huge backyard. Huge.  With tons of cornhole sets, ping pong tables, games, live music. It's a huge backyard party, with a roof.  It's a grown up Disneyland.. with beer."}
{"text":"I tried Culinary Dropout today with a friend for lunch and really enjoyed the experience. I liked how they brightened and opened up the space since it was Pink Taco. Our server (didn't catch her name) was extremely helpful in offering some great suggestions of what to try. I went with the turkey sandwich with coleslaw on pretzel bread (but I got the mustard on the side). I love pretzel bread! It was a great choice and delicious. Fries were good too, although nothing special. And, the price was just right. My friend liked her dish as well - the chicken salad with pears and Gorgonzola. I'd definitely go back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"We went here with a huge group of 150 people. They were efficiently staffed, the food was amazing, the drinks were stellar and the atmosphere was awesome. The decor and music was very laid back and cool. Try the pretzel fondue... to die for!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials. Love both the red and white sangria so yummy. Also the pretzels and fondue are to die for. Love the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Came her for a friends birthday dinner. Food was good but the beer was just bad. They had a fat tire tent serving beer next to the corn hole. I asked for three beers and two were nice and cold, mine was warm. What kind of bartender serves a warm beer? Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch as part of Restaurant Week and enjoyed our lunch. 

At noon on a Saturday we were seated without delay in the large restaurant. Our friendly, attentive waitress was right over to get our orders started. 

I started with Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue which were delicious. The pretzels were indeed soft and the cheese was tasty. The Italian Chopped Salad was also delicious and a generous portion. There was a great variety of meats and vegetables in the salad with couscous that added a little something to the salad. The Italian dressing was good and not too heavy. My Chocolate S'mores Pudding was an excellent ending to the meal. The melted marshmallow on top of the chocolate pudding would be delicious enough, but the grahams for dipping made it perfect. Overall, I was very happy with every part of my lunch.

My husband started with a House Salad that was fine and then The Pub Burger that he really enjoyed. The fries on the side were crispy and delicious. His Banana Crème Pie was a pop of banana flavor and delicious.

The only things I didn't love about the restaurant was that despite an entire wall being windows the restaurant was very dark. They could definitely benefit from more lighting as ambiance lifter. At the risk of sounding old, the music was far too loud for the middle of the day. It wasn't a big deal for a party of two, but in a group conversation would be limited to only the person next to you. Other than those small things I think Culinary Dropout is a good spot to grab a meal or drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"I went to Culinary Dropout with a group of friends a week ago. Beautiful decor. It's a trendy place to hang with friends. We started with drinks, which were not particularly memorable. The service was fine, but the food was less impressive. EXCEPTION: the pretzels with fondue! I'm not a pretzel fan by any means, but these are pillows of perfectly salted, fluffy goodness paired with warm cheese fondue! Incredible! I would come back for a beer and the pretzels! 

I ordered the broccoli cheddar cannelloni  as my entree. I would definitely skip this dish. Kind of reminded me of broccoli cheese casserole stuffed into pasta. The server willingly exchanged my entree for the fried chicken. The fried chicken and mashed potatoes were pretty good. Several people at the table ordered this popular item. Another person ordered the black muscles as an entree, which were served in a delicious white sauce with bread. The muscles are a nice portion! 

Overall, some things worked. Some didn't."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. I've had a variety of dishes and they are always very good and unique.  There is a good beer selection and the drinks are very good too.

I would definitely recommend trying the white shrimp. The fondue and pretzel are great. I love the mussels. 

I've been quite a bit and the food keeps me coming back but I had to mark the place down due to the staff.  The staff just doesn't seem to treat the people who don't fit their mold of preferred guest well. You can wait a long time for service and they clearly treat other tables or patrons better."}
{"text":"My wife took me to this place for my birthday along with my daughter. Food was not bad.. I am in the hospitality industry( restaurant) for yrs. well first off I  did not like our server Jonathan walk to our table with shirt unbuttoned to his stomach.. not a good sight when you are for dinner and then he just went sat by my wife to take our order. I am not a jealous guy haha but you need to read your guests to know if they are comfortable with that. We ordered and I asked that my French fries be substituted by a salad, he said sure but I still got French fries and no salad. My ribs were dried and not really what I thought. I have heard about this place a lot and then came to try and was not very impressed mostly with the service.  Jonathan your unbuttoned shirt is not appealing. This is feedback for management. Thank you"}
{"text":"Love this place and I've been here a handful of times. But I got food poisoning from their kale chipped salad last night, and not loving it so much."}
{"text":"I had the pork ribs with jalapeño and molasses sauce It was unbelievably good The staff was very nice and helpful The new culinary in tempe is friggin huge! Definitely a spot for a huge group to go together One thing I will say is that all those hipster bartenders need to shave their beards"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try after the Iron Man race at Tempe Beach Park.  It looks like it is in a warehouse...and is awesome inside.
We ordered the preztel bites (seemed like every table did as well), pork belly nachos (mmm, i appreciate the use of nacho cheese), fried chicken and ramen (pleasantly surprised with how good this was...and i'm asian!)
The food came out really fast, the servers were nice and on top of it (drink refills came before i even noticed!) and the food was great.
I will definitely return the next time i am in town...and might even play some games."}
{"text":"Restaurant Report Card: C+ 

 I gamble at Hard Rock fairly frequently and I've always wanted to check this place out. The 4-star Yelp reviews and clever restaurant name is what sold me. Since I was dining with my imaginary friends, we headed over to the bar area to cause a ruckus. I ordered the Turkey Pastrami sandwich w/ side salad, based on the bartender's recommendation. 

As I was waiting, I people watched the hordes of tatted up, juiceheads and guidos running around half naked .My in-dining entertainment, included a patron who lined up a shot of vodka, the $4 pineapple mind eraser special, a Pabst Blue Ribbon, and a glass of wine and pounded all 4 drinks within a minute. Super classy.

The food arrived fairly quickly. The sandwich was served with a warm pretzel roll, with generous slices of turkey pastrami, swiss cheese, and smothered with cole slaw.  The sandwich was okay. Pretty messy to eat and it didn't have a wow-factor. The salad was just average too. Chilled romaine lettuce, bits of cucumber, and covered with a watery buttermilk ranch dressing. The menu, including water, came out to be a whoppin' $18 dollars with tip. 

The bartenders were friendly and was very prompted in serving us. I took a look at the drink menu prices, and we took our party elsewhere. 

A little about my credentials:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've been here twice in the last couple of weeks so I must like it. 

First visit - Sunday brunch with friends. We had a reservation, but it didn't matter as the place was half empty. Had a boatload of food and mimosas. Got the pretzels to start and OMG they are delicious as is the fondue that comes with them. I went on to the egg sandwich, which was really solid. The kid had the captain crunch French toast, which was great, but very sweet - almost like dessert. Everyone else loved their dishes as well. The service was friendly and efficient.

Second visit - Happy Hour with the hubs. Yippee - those 'to die for' pretzels are on the happy hour menu so you know we ordered them. Also got the antipasto plate which had a nice mix of things. Of course, we enjoyed a few cocktails, from the Happy Hour menu as well. And in the end we were, duh, happy. Once again, great service.

I really dig this place and like the décor. Also, like looking out at the pool and cant' wait to go back when the weather is a little cooler and they open the garage doors.  I just hope this place can make it. It wasn't very busy on either of our visits."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. We started our meal with the pretzel fondue and had a pub burger and the crispy shrimp salad. We would both order the same thing again and were sad when it was over. The ambiance is also incredible."}
{"text":"Sunny outdoor seating (think pintuck sofas) and tall ceilings, modern dark wood interior and decor with a music theme (both playing over the speakers and in the art) coupled with fresh salads and lots of savory options.. I will be back."}
{"text":"This establishment is so cool!  The design, atmosphere, and decor are great!  There's a large dining area with neat tables and a gorgeous bar, the second phase/ room is more tables with a mix of chic chairs and couches with lawn chairs, corn hole, shuffleboard, and more fun, then the third phase/room is like a huge barn with another bar and large tables, chic couches with tables, and gorgeous lighting arrangements.  
The bar offered a variety of beers, cocktails, wines, even a brown bag beer special!

The food, oh god the food- so good!  The pretzel bite things with fondue for the starter were to die for!  I was a little bummed in that I ordered smoked salmon, but was given a grilled salmon with risotto- the server claimed it was the smoked salmon, it definitely wasn't,but it was still ah-mazing.  The risotto was perfect.  

Great service, love the decor, very spacious and open!  This place is a real gem- must try when in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! Amazing restaurant. Went there on a Wednesday night and listened to some amazing music. The bartenders were so friendly and helpful. Especially Michael, he recommended me the El Matador. Very impressed! I will be back again."}
{"text":"Try the pretzel balls they are soooo delicious with the melted candlelit cheese! The bartender makes fantastic drinks and gives excellent service. We had an issue with our bill and the manager Daniel took great care of us. Can't wait to come back and enjoy the beautiful atmosphere, food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Love the concept but hated the meat market bar. We were forced to watch many couples requiring rooms at a hotel. Our waiter was somewhat of a dimwit, harmless but not the brightest. What gave us the biggest laugh was she would shake her boobs every time she started to walk away from a table or hostess station. We were literally dying at our table. Food was just ok not great. Not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"Really cool place. It has a modern industrial 'warehouse' feel, but it's still very comfortable. 

I had the ribs, and it was more food than I could eat. Very well cooked, and the sauce was perfect. Fries were perfectly salted."}
{"text":"This place is awesome my husband wanted to bring me here and the menu is simple but sweet  . We had the prosciutto amd aged menchago and brussell sprouts and deviled eggs the flavors worked so well together yum!!!!! I will be going back"}
{"text":"I was able to get same day reservations on a Thursday evening. Parking was difficult but good thing valet parking ($7 + tip) was right outside the door. Great service and tasty food. Although the fried chicken I ordered was only lukewarm, it was very good. I almost sent it back but figured they would only warm it in a microwave oven. I wonder if it had been prepared ahead of time since it was served to me in about 5 minutes after I ordered it (the menu said it \"would be worth the wait\" as if it would be cooked upon ordering). Nonetheless, I was happy to get in on a Thursday evening, had excellent service, a very good fried chicken dinner, and a nice cold Guinness beer.  I will definitely be back but will ask if the fried chicken is prepared ahead of time or at the time of ordering; I'm sure it will be worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant. Has a very hipster theme. Went for breakfast and had no wait to get in at just about noon. Didn't order cocktails but they have a fairly large drink menu. I got the captn crunch french toast and it was off the hook! Not as sweet as i was expecting, but very good. 

We split the monkey bread and it was also really good. 

Only complaints were that service was a little slow and someone in my group ordered tabasco sauce when we ordered our meal and didn't come so we had to wait. The server didn't really make any recommendations or have much to say about the menu at all (we asked). 

Would certainly return for dinner."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and live music on a Thursday night! A decent selection of delicious local microbrews but the food menu is TINY."}
{"text":"We've been here several times.  It's the perfect place to go if you are shopping around Fashion Square and looking for great food without overeating.  The small plates and patio make for a relaxing snack.  My favorite is the asparagus, but you can't go wrong with any of the cheeses.  Just be sure to order a plate of crusty bread."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst culinary dropouts on the valley. We went their for happy hour and we had to ask the waitress for the menu. Service was very slow and the food came out cold. We went off of a recommendation from some colleagues but was not pleased with this location. We will definitely try another location."}
{"text":"First off I would like to thank Payne. He was inviting, helpful, understanding and just a great server. I was celebrating a suprise birthday party tonight for my wife's mother and Payne helped me save 2 of his high top tables for a party of 18 in his section in the yard area. He pleasantly waited as my large family trickled in constantly checking in with us and making sure my family had a pleasant experience. 
The surprise was a total success and even though we had separate checks he was ready and able to expedite at a moment's notice. He truly made this a special day for my family. Thank you so much Payne, not only is your name bad*** but so are you. Rock on man cause I will recommend anyone to come to the yard and have you as there server."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner on a Saturday night. It was difficult leaving Aria due to bad traffic on the strip and was 30minutes late. The hostess gladly gave us a table. The ambiance was cool and hip with plenty of TVs and different tables for various groups. Our waiter was very friendly and gave us water right away which is nice. The menu is one page and not complicated to read. The Thai child chicken wings was delicious and tasty for appetiser. I also ordered fried chicken and it was delicious with crispy skin. The biscuit was crumbly and buttery while mash potatoes was moist and buttery too. The waiter was very good on refills and has a friendly attitude. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Great Hipster place!!! Meaning: 

1.) Good tasting and well thought out food selection
2.) Nice craft beer selection
3.) Staff is friendly, tattooed, pierced and trendily dressed
4.) Little over priced

Gotta have all four to be called a good hipster place."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Modern, funky, relaxed feel. A little too hipster with the staffing, but great menu and drinks. Outdoor patio available. Had Caesar salad, tasted great, could have used a few croutons though. Fried chicken w/ mashed and biscuit was awesome."}
{"text":"I think this place is so awesome!!! It's so different and exciting. We were seated inside and got an extremely comfortable leather booth.  I do wish we would have been seated outside but maybe next time.  We ordered the pretzels and fondue and it was awesome!  Huge portion and worth the $10. Also tried pulled pork nachos and the chips were bomb!  

Burgers and fries were good too but next time I'll try another burger.  Mine tasted too similar to big mac. 

Service was great.  Waiter was attentive and gave us to go beverages.  Very courteous."}
{"text":"For decor alone, Culinary Dropout gets 5 stars. Lots of natural elements with sparkly chandeliers and a huge patio space with all of the aforementioned games. I really love that they paid homage to the auto-body or motorcycle shop that it was formerly on the sign out on the street. The open concept is fabulous.

Me and a girlfriend of mine came here for lunch last week and got there early as I've heard from friends who work there and other people who have visited that there can be quite a wait both at lunch and at dinner which I totally understand as it's a new spot in a great location. I'm glad we did as there was little to no people there so we were able to get a seat quickly. 

We started out with the pretzel and provolone fondue...YUMMY! I totally indulged my inner fatty but we split it so I didn't feel quite as guilty.  I ordered one of my favorite drinks to try at different places just to see how each place mixes it up (literally), the Moscow Mule. It was pretty good...not the best I've had but it was good. After pigging out on pretzels, we both ordered the Spring Salad which we were told had just been added to the menu and that was the first time they were being debuted; It consisted mainly of asparagus, beets, green beans, greens and a vinaigrette. The salad was tasty and light..perfect for the warm weather. 

While we should have stopped there, we decided to get the salted caramel corn that came in a glass with caramel pudding I believe on the bottom layer. So good! My sweet tooth was satisfied.

I will say, it's a pretty pricey lunch at $75 but I'm definitely gonna come back on a Sunday Funday biking kind of day to check out the bar and the patio."}
{"text":"Have been to a couple of locations in the valley and not impressed with food at all. The music is too loud and hard to converse with people at your table."}
{"text":"Excellent food....excellent staff.  Had dinner here on Wednesday, 8/31/16 while on vacation in Phoenix.  Great hipster joint, love the ambiance.  We shared two entrees-the meatloaf (2 die for) and the Cannelloni (scrumptious)- the waiter actually had both entrees split onto two plates for us.  Just a great place.  My only reason for not giving it 5 stars --- really loud inside, I felt like I was screaming all through dinner."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, slow and inattentive service. Spoke with server several times about peanut allergy and never got a straight answer. Nice place, but not worth the price, disappointing service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Huge place with a great beer selection and great happy hour. I had the pretzels and cheese dip. The dip was good but the pretzels were amazing and they give you enough for four people. I also got the happy hour meatloaf sandwich. It was big and delicious. I bite in to it and wondered how it was different and why was it so good...MAYONNAISE! Wow, I never heard of this but it was sooooo good. Great place!"}
{"text":"This place is really different. The set up is very interesting. The tables are huge with big chairs that look like something you'd find in your grandmother's living room. The booths are also big leather couches that give off the same vibe. But it all comes together in a cool modern kind of way. The chairs are comfortable, but there's big downside. I'm short, so the table was oddly high. 

Culinary dropout is also kind of small, so we waited a while to get a table, but once we ordered, the food came out ridiculously fast. But the it was really good, and the prices are pretty low (especially compared to the other places in the Waterfront/Fashion Square Mall area). 

The cocktail menu is really impressive. I would definitely head back just to try the random assortment of drinks they make. Their Appetizer menu also has a lot interesting temptations. 

I would recommend Culinary Dropout as a perfect happy hour spot. Hit it up sometime with your friends and coworkers on at an early time on a weekday evening."}
{"text":"Just finished having lunch here. While the food was decent, the wait for said food was ridiculous. It took almost an hour for our food to come out. The restaurant appeared to be decently busy but not busy enough for that kind of wait! Seems to me that some more efficiency in the kitchen is warranted."}
{"text":"Sorry I'm not a fan but its probably just me.  Its a fun place to go once but we have gone at least 6 times over the last few years.  I think its great for lunch but if you are going for dinner its just way too noisy and slow. Its and energetic place for sure but you can only talk to the person sitting next to you and if you are with a large party forget about hearing whats going on at the other end of the table. If you don't like your in-laws you can put them at the other end of the table and bump the rating to 5 stars.  I thought it was just me but there were several in my group who felt the same way.  The food has always been good so my whining should be taken in the context of a family gathering where we are all trying to catch up on what everyone is up to."}
{"text":"Unique, odd, interesting, different - just pick your adjective and enjoy.  Since we were a party of four, we got to have a few different things around the table starting with the pretzel bites which was more than plenty to share around the table.  I am on a salad kick and therefore ordered the kale and sweet potato salad with the salmon on top, and since I was hungry, yesterday's soup (chicken tortilla that day); the crunchy bits in the salad are pomegranate and overall it was a tasty and filling salad and salmon had a nice, flaky, crusty, finish that seems like the result of sweet glaze that I would love to replicate. My guy got the fried chicken and left nothing but bones on his plate.  I don't recall what the other guy at my table ordered other than his drink which was the \"double blind\" which turned out to be a 12oz can of Schafer Light and 1oz bottle of Smirnoff vodka; we had a great time laughing about it and then he ordered a Corona. The other gal at the table ordered the turkey pastrami, it was huge and she took half of it to go at the end of the meal.

As important as the food - the service.  I cannot recall the server's name, but he was attentive without being annoying and patient while we waffled over what to order initially.  Drinks were refilled in a timely manner without demand during the meal itself and since it was early and not crowded yet, he was patient without intrusion while we all chatted after the meal.  

Quite possibly my favorite of the dinner venues we visited during the trip."}
{"text":"Amazing!! 
Everything was on point. The trout was incredible. The appetizers were awesome. They had great live music and they played every genre of music. Loved this place. Definitely will come back next time I visit AZ"}
{"text":"Beautiful food presentation, good service. My family really enjoyed the comfy outdoor seating. The portions were small but considering I was going shopping/trying on clothes after dinner that's probably an okay thing. 

We loved the little pretzel rolls and fondue as an appetizer. I'm pretty faithful to a vegetarian diet but since my parents were in town and they 'don't believe in the whole not eating meat thing', I obliged their request to eat fish and got the salmon. As guilty as I felt eating it... It was pretty good. 

Like most of the Fox Concepts restaurants, the bar looked like a lot of fun. I think next time I visit I'll just Uber over and drink my dinner."}
{"text":"Culinary dropout has become one of my favorite bars in town. The bartenders are amazing and can create any delicious cocktail that you want. The vibe is always fun and the crowd is always a good time. The pretzels and fondue are a must have!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: based on my original Yelp review we were invited back to try it again. This time our sever was Manu who was amazing! My overall theme in the original review was the food wasn't necessarily the freshest. This time I got the prime rib dip sandwich with mushrooms and jalapeños. The sand which was one of the best prime rib dips I've ever had.  The dip was super flavorful without being too salty. The prime rib was tender and delicious. My girl got the sweet corn ravioli with prosciutto, which was recommended by our waiter Manu and that turned out to be amazingly tender and so flavorful. I can't stress enough how gracious and attentive the staff was and how good the food was this time. I've updated my rating to reflect my new experience which is more in line with the recommendations I've previously gotten. I would definitely recommend this in the future and I will be back for that sandwich. 

------------------------------------------------

The restaurant itself is very nice. The staff was great and our server Kael was awesome. That's the good. Now the bad. We ate there on the last night of restaraunt week and decided to do their special. My girl ordered the steak tacos and I got the fried chicken. On the menu the chicken says it takes longer but is worth the wait. I'm not sure why I didn't take a pic of the chicken. I just didn't think about it. It did not take longer than her tacos and when it came out it was extra greasy and lukewarm. Additionally there were spots in the chicken where it wasn't battered at all. When I tried it besides being lukewarm it wasn't seasoned very well. The steak tacos we ordered were decent but again did not taste fresh, like maybe they had not been cooked fresh or something. The corn tortillas were brittle and dry and like the chicken lukewarm. I've had a lot of people tell me the food is great here but that wasn't our experience this time. As it is I could not recommend this place. Very trendy, kinda pricey and food wasn't great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for drinks hanging out and good overall selection of food. Pretzels and cheese are clutch. Great Draft beer selection along with bottles. If your in the area definitely worth a drop in. Great service and friendly staff. FYI Friday's and Saturday nights are busy so make sure to plan Accordingly. Cheers"}
{"text":"I am generally very skeptical of casino restaurants. They all seem to be chain like purveyors of dependable mediocrity. This place however was different. The food here was exceptional.

My party had several appetizers and each one was distinct and delicious. The soft pretzels were actually delectable pretzel rolls served with a warm cheese. The Brussel sprouts were the best I have ever had, and the brussel sprout sauce was even better when sopped up with a soft pretzel. The beets and goat cheese were fantastic as well. 

For an entree I had the turkey sandwich. It was very good, but to be fair, I was so full on appetizers that I could barely concentrate on me entree. 

Other things to note were that the drinks were awesome, and our waiter, Sean I believe was his name, was super attentive and knowledgeable. 

The whole meal was a wonderful experience beginning to end."}
{"text":"the name says it all. he dropped out of culinary school, therefore don't expect the food to taste like a Michelin star.

It tried to be this hipster-ish vibe but falls short.
 
The food is okay. theres too many good restaurants in scottsdale, no need to come back to this one."}
{"text":"I love this place for their ribs and cocktails! You can't go wrong when ordering anything off their menu including the drinks. The bartenders are also so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great food especially the homemade pretzel bites !! Matt the bartender was awesome  will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"GM and the staff thereafter was Terrific. Food was good drinks were good friends were priceless"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Gastropubs I've been to! The location is great right in the heart of Scottsdale and by the Fashion Square Mall. We called for reservations at the last minute and they were able to accommodate us!

The ambiance is very chill and artsy. Dim lighting and dark furniture. They have outdoor seating as well which is covered. 

Our waiter was friendly and service was on point. 

The table ordered antipasti appetizer with bunch of cheeses and meats. This is a must have if you go! We also ordered the pretzels and it was fresh, warm and delicious! 

I got the kale and corn salad which I loved. Great seasoning and I didn't feel like they skimped out on anything. The waiter was also cool enough to bring a happy birthday dessert for my friend. They have the usual drinks. I had wine. You can't go wrong with wine. 

Overall I love the ambiance this is a cool spot for a romantic date but can also be good for groups for a special occasion or just because. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The service was too notch, the cocktails came quickly and strongly, food was quite nice! A little pricey, but it's the strip and to be expected. Nice place for a date night! Live music, great atmosphere. Plan to return at some point!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, the atmosphere is excellent. The food was very very good. I love the Moscow mule. Our waiter suggested the Mac burger, very good choice. Next time I'm going to have to save room to try their desserts"}
{"text":"My nephew and niece took me here and I was amazed by the ambitious menu.  Happy to report the place pulled it off. They make everything from scratch here.  Despite the place being super busy our server was never far away and always made sure we were taken care of.  There is a hipster vibe to the place and it is very popular with the local college crowd.  According to the locals that brought me, they have tried about a dozen items and never been disappointed.  I opted for the excellent Korean rib-eye with a glass of draught Polygamy Porter, a perfect accompaniment. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had a debacle at this place, so I'll go start to finish.  

We made our reservations 2 weeks ago for a party of 20 for a Birthday.  The day of, Management called to let us know someone needed to be there at 530PM for our 6PM reservation to check in,  We arrived at 530PM.  They advised us that the table wouldn't be ready until 6PM.  That was fine, we were just checking in.  6PM came and went and although there was plenty of room in the lounge, we weren't seated.  They wanted to seat us in the yard.  Unfortunately there was a crowd at our section that wouldn't leave.  Management and the server advised them numerous times they needed to move their party, but they didn't budge.  Then management even gave them free appetizers and their bills to get them moving.  About 630PM they moved us to a partial section next to these people.  There was only enough room for half our party and the other half had to stand while waiting for this group to move.  They were very drunk and had been there since 2PM.  I only know this because they made sure to tell us it was wrong of us to make them leave since they were there since 2PM.  They finally started moving out and a guy in their group came up to a women in our group holding a baby and started a fight.  

Management provided us with free qpps for the inconvenience.  Not enough to feed 20 people.  But the food and our server were good.  The drinks and food are overpriced.  They do offer a brown bag special beer for $2.  It varies from Natural light to Old Style.  My aluminum bottle of Coors Light was $5.50.  The pretzel bites were really good.   They came with cheese fondue.  We also had fresh chips with onion dip.  That was really good too.  We ordered the Chicken meatballs and they were a great twist on chicken wings.  Lots of flavor and moist.  We also shared the beef dip.  It was really good too.  Again, over priced for what you get. 

The idea of this place is there.  They have a fresh clam/oyster bar in one section.  They have the yard which has lots of outdoor seating with heaters and fire pits.  They also have corn hole, ping pong and shuffle board, and a fun photo booth.  There is a lounge area and the bar is between the lounge and yard.  There are too many young, young people working here.  They need more of a variety.  We would go back, but only for dinner and games."}
{"text":"This place is right in the cute area of Scottsdale near the mall.  The indoor seating area and bar are really cute, but I've only sat on the outdoor patio.  

The outdoor patio has comfortable seating and is very comfortable.  

I've had the Soft pretzel and fondue provolone, which was huge and very filling!  

The Cheese, bread and olive oil  was a great start to a meal, but the balsamic was a little too much.

I have to say, the best deal is the happy hour antipasti!  It's a huge portion and great variety!

Sweet potato canneloni was my main meal twice and its with mushrooms, Brussels sprouts and Parmesan.  It has good flavor and is a good portion. 

The drink menu is extensive and reasonable for the area.  I really like this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey pastrami pretzel bun sammi which is always bomb, the did forget a topping; however, they re-made a brand new plate even though I finished the fries is about 5 minutes. Little things like that happen in the restaurant biz but customer service in those situations are what make the difference. Our server Jon Jon definitely took care of us and the atmosphere was awesome like always"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. There are live bands, fire pits, ping pong and shuffle board, photo booth, cool lounge chairs and did I mention the food is great? Seriously, this place has it all!"}
{"text":"Trendy spot with a diverse menu.  The Korean-style cap steak, meatloaf, and mac and cheese were all good and reasonably priced, but not good enough to make me feel compelled to come back (though I still want to try the hamburger there).  Cocktails were very good."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant before and really liked it.  However, we weren't able to try it tonight because the staff can't seem to tell time.  We were told that the wait would be about an hour and fifteen minutes.  An hour and forty five minutes later, with no idea from the hostess of when we would actually be able to sit, we gave up and left.  We may give it another try but will make reservations.  But I doubt they will do any better even with those."}
{"text":"Very loud, mostly unfriendly staff. Great ambience for a bachelorette party (saw one while we were there). Ok food but not worth the wait, or chaotic environment."}
{"text":"This morning some friends and I stopped by the culinary drop out in the downtown location. I usually go to the Scottsdale or Tempe one but I was near the downtown area. Our experience was fantastic. The food was delicious, but what made this experience extraordinary was our server Wendy.  Wendy went above and beyond to meet our needs. She served us in a very warm and welcoming manner. She was very efficient in precise in taking and fulfilling our orders. Overall she was very enjoyable to have as a server and I will be requesting her every time I visit this location."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Culinary was interesting.  We went for girl's night and had a table of 7.  At least three times I ordered something from the waitress that didn't come, and when I asked about my order she replied \"oh, I wasn't sure you wanted it\".  The food was okay, the table shared the pretzels and beer cheese, which tasted a bit like melted Kraft American cheese slices.  I ordered the grilled cheese sliders from the happy hour menu and they were adorable mini-sandwiches.  However (!) the menu said their grilled cheese came with bacon, but apparently the sliders don't.  So it was just bread and a butt-load of cheese, but still tasty.  I ordered the Gypsy Shandy and it was DELICIOUS.  The way it was described was rum and a splash of Mexican soda, but it tasted like lemonade, piña colada, and rainbows.  I had as many as I could fit in before HH ended, then switched to the brown bag special, which was a mystery selection can of beer in a brown bag for less than $2.  All in all it was a nice experience, but with all the selections to choose from in Old Town, I'm not sure this is the best."}
{"text":"Had drinks with coworkers here. Drinks were well made, staff was super friendly and the place itself has a nice dimmed lighting."}
{"text":"There are lots of nice places in Vegas to eat and many are in the casinos, but this one is much different. They make everything from scratch daily.  

They have an eclectic menu with many incredible items.  They also have daily specials, like their soup which was amazing!

The service we received was incredible!  The server and manager came by several times to check on us, ensure all was well and keep us genuinely happy to be there.

We really liked the décor as well.  

Can't wait to go back next time we're in the area!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The decor is rustic and a little old school, which I think is pretty cool. The atmosphere is cool and casual. The food...there are so many culinary delights to tickle your tastebuds I don't know where to begin. I had the crispy shrimp Caesar salad and it was so delicious. All of the burgers are great and they have great beers to compliment. Go here! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was beautiful!!!  The atmosphere was awesome as well as our server was really attentive and nice!!!  We got the pretzels with cheese dip and it was not my favorite, but I'm not a huge fan of pretzels and dip anyways.  Our server gave them to us for free because she forgot to put our order into the kitchen.  However, she couldn't have forgotten for more than 5 minutes; we had our food within 15 to 20 minutes.  It was really sweet of her to do!!!  My Husband got the Thai Chile Chicken Wings.  I loved them and he was not all that thrilled.  I just don't think he is used to Thai flavors.  I got the Sweet Corn Ravioli and my Husband and I both LOVED it!! I can't even describe how awesome and different it was!!!  I would defiantly go back!!!  However, I wish they had more menu options. I felt like nothing looked good to me, but when I actually tried it, it was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food was great too.  I little far to go all the time, but for special occasion."}
{"text":"Never again.

My husband and I ate here on July 13th.  We were seated outside, under a mister that was more like  London drizzle than mist.  I ended up soaking wet from the back of my legs to the top of my shirt.

Next, the food.  I the pretzel roll fondue was the highlight and that isn't saying much.  The rolls tasted like store bought, but the fondue was good.  Thus the one star.

I had the fried chicken.  It came out greasy with a biscuit that tasted more like lard and a dash of honey than anything else.  The gravy was not good either.  I ate less than half of the chicken.

My husband had the jambalaya.  It was basically a bowl of rice.  We were warned it was spicy but that was not the case.  The sausage was flavorless and he had ONLY TWO SHRIMP, both of which were mealy and the size of a quarter.  I've had better quality cocktail shrimp at Du-Par's downtown.  Not worth the price.

I woke up later that night with a racing heart, nausea, and clammy skin.  I ended up sick and for the better part of the next day all I tasted was the grease from that chicken. 

As locals, we are always looking for a new, fun place to eat.  This ain't it."}
{"text":"I came here around 6pm on a Wednesday.  The place was almost empty which was perfect.  My friend and I didn't have to wait to be seated or anything and service was prompt.

I started off with the soft pretzels and fondue. That coupled with an IPA that they had on tap (sorry I forgot the name of it) was PERFECT!  Then I had the Fried chicken that came with mashed potatoes, cole slaw and a biscuit.  Again, PERFECT.  Easily some of the best fried chicken I've ever had in my life.  Perfectly crispy, yet tender and extremely juicy.

For dessert I had the Salted Caramel custard with popcorn.  Again, this place completely nailed it on everything that I ordered.  

I rarely give out a 5 star review but this place was as close to perfect as you can get (considering where I was and what I was in the mood for at that moment in time).

I'd recommend coming at an off-peak hour as I hear that place can get pretty crowded and have longer wait times to be seated.  So if you're in Vegas and in the mood for comfort food and great beer, there really isn't another spot on the strip to go to!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Culinary Dropout with my son.  As starters we tried the house made beef jerky, brussel sprouts, beets and deviled eggs.  The eggs were average but the others were very very good.  The 'korean-style' sprouts have a very nice bit of spice in the sauce.

We each had the Italian Grinder sandwich.  Good portion of meat.  Nicely seasoned.

Will be heading back for dinner sometime to try out the entrees."}
{"text":"Pretty much the same as arrogant butcher, nice place to meet up for a drink or something to eat.
Turkey Pastrami is what I gravitate towards on the menu."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout (specifically this location) is becoming a weekly thing for me, and let me just say - it never disappoints. My go-to is the garden kale salad with chicken. I seriously don't know what it is about this salad, but it always tastes so fresh and it literally never gets old! I'm also a big fan of their sangria here. I think it might be the same sangria they serve at all Fox Restaurants, so I pretty much always get it! Not to mention the fact that the staff here is always so friendly and awesome in every way!

If you've never been, the pretzels and cheese fondue dip are a definite must order! Looking for an appetizer on the lighter side? The hummus + pita is really great too! As I'm writing this review, I can't help but to reminisce on all the times I've been in to Culinary recently. Whether it be drinks after work with a friend, a corporate work party, or simply a casual Monday night - Culinary is great on all occasions, which is what I love most about it. Dress it up or dress it down, there's no right or wrong here. This aspect shines through in what you order as well. A few of my other favorites: their Thai Chile chicken wings (which is not something I would usually go for) as well as their sweet corn ravioli! Order some appetizers or split a couple dishes among friends! My biggest advice is to explore the menu and branch out! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to Culinary many times before. I always have a great experience. Good food, fun music, good drinks, friendly staff! All the characteristics Fox restaurants poses (that's why they're my favorite). However my most recent experience at this Culinary wasn't so fabulous. It was still good but it definitely wasn't how it is usually - must have been an off night! 

I went with a big group of girls to celebrate a birthday. The server we had seemed a little overwhelmed with it all. Maybe she was new, and this is completely understandable - but I just wish management would have taken note of this and had someone jump in and help her (for her own sake). This is the only reason I thought I'd mention it in a review. A dinner that usually would take 1 to 2 hours took an upward of 3! Due to the fact that we were like the only table in the restaurant, this just didn't make much sense to us! 

Enough about that though, when a food at a place like this is as good as it is, ONE poor experience with customer service won't turn me off. I got the garden kale salad and it was sooo yummy! Light, tangy, and fresh! I just loved it. I'm a picky salad eater. The dressing has to taste right to me, and it has to go well with the toppings on it. This is my new favorite and I can't believe this was my first time trying it! I'll be back again Culinary - I promise!"}
{"text":"Comfort food at its finest !! we had a large party, 15 or so, so we had a nice variety of meals, everyone was incredibly happy with their food. It was so good we went 3 times in the 10 days were in vegas.

the Pretzels ARE A MUST !!"}
{"text":"I found everything about this experience exceptional. From the wide open space and how it was used effectively to create a comfortable environment to the modern layout and design.

As for the food I would give it five stars for sure. With the mix of comfort food and quality presentation I found this visit thoroughly enjoyable. 

As for the food we had pirogi and the green chili stew. What can I say The flavors on the pirogi we're perfectly married to complement each other and stand independently. Then there was the green chile stew. For something as simple sounding has a bowl of stew a slice of cornbread I've been obsessed with this dish ever since I left days ago. The amount of green chili and seasoning was perfect so as not to overpower any One component of the dish. It's a dish you can definitely not the wrong with."}

Friday night I found myself at Culinary Dropout with a harem of eight girlfriends, all requesting frou-frou drinks, taking for-EVER to order through our endless [and generally mindless] chatter, and planning to split the check.  In other words, the type of dining party so annoying to the serving community that they usually bribe the hostesses to make sure a gaggle like us never appears in their section.
And you know what?  We had excellent service.  A very fun, patient, and helpful server swadddled us through an enjoyable evening.  Either she's used to the Scottsdale-ness of it all, or she finds herself frequently in the same situation when out with friends.

So, Culinary Dropout is absolutely exactly what you would expect it to be. It's FRC, so it's Scene-y, Scottsdale-y, Silly, but nonetheless a fun place to get together.  I liked seeing a wide range of ages- from the just-turned 21 pups to the full-grown cougs', the full spectrum of lifespan was represented.

The cocktails were middle of the road.  I started with the Home-Ec Martini, a combo of Belvedere Vodka, Grand Marnier, Strawberry, Basil, Lemon Juice.  The only thing I tasted was Strawberry, which would have been ok if it wasn't the canned, syrupy, disgusting kind.  Yuck.  Switched to beer, and was very happy with the Abita Purple Haze, a crisp and delicious beer with hints of wheat, vanilla and raspberry.  

In typical annoying-chick fashion, we ordered rounds of appetizers rather than entrees.  I was leery of the pretzel fondue assuming it would taste like a frozen Costco pretzel with Velveeta, but it was actually quite good.  The fondue was just the right consistency and the creamy, buttery provolone was delicious.  You can't really go wrong with melted cheese, though.
We were mildly impressed with the selection of meats & cheeses.  Nothing out of the ordinary, standard but tasteful.  Same with the salmon- good; neither stellar or stinky.

In the end we did not split the check, we figured she'd endured enough!"}
{"text":"This is new since our last time in Tempe and we liked it enough the first time to come back (yes we ordered different food!) again within two days. The venue itself is large with a big indoor space as well as an outdoor space. It's Tempe and it's August...we chose to sit inside. Happy hour prices for both drinks and food are good and they have a dollar beer-in-a-bag. We liked our food a bit better the first day when we selected soft preztels with a cheese fondue dip. Those were delicious, but rich, and we couldn't quite finish between the two of us, though we did take the leftover pretzels home. Out other split was a kale salad that had corn and all kinds of other good stuff in it and that was completed with a light and flavorful dressing. On the second trip we had a pimento cheese appetizer and potato chips. Both were good; we needed bread for the cheese, but were able to get by with the potato chips. One person in our party got a chicken sandwich. It was good, but there were a couple of bones or pieces of fat/cartilage in the chicken that were a bit unsavory (our guest was polite and didn't explain). We ordered the grilled cheese sliders the second day. They are rich and good and just a bit too much for how I've been eating lately. Rather than ordering a plate for myself, I'd be more inclined to split an order and a salad.... All in all, the food is good, the ambiance is great, the service is above average for sure, and the portion sizes are generous for the price. Came back twice in a couple of days...I'm sure I'll return again in the future....."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and drinks in a trendy atmosphere.  Love the yard area to play bags, ping pong, etc"}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance. The date, walnut, and fig taster paired perfectly with the goat cheese. I had a salad (forgot the name). The portion was perfect. No complaints about the food. The service was excellent."}

It has been awhile since I checked out CD's happy hour, so I invited a coworker to join me to see what's new.  Looks like CD's done away with their cheese and charcuterie check list and just added a cheese plate.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=bKR19j9BvpE4gSwGo-CmQA#bKR19j9BvpE4gSwGo-CmQA  Not bad- enjoyed the cheese (one tiny rectangular piece) and thumb-sized serving of jam, the Marcona almonds and delicious almonds were plentiful, and the grilled asparagus were all good.   Didn't really care for the bland breadsticks, and what's with the measly serving of bread (2 tiny pieces)?  I refrained from asking for more until the very last second, and I felt like my server didn't like the request, but she recovered very fast.  Just don't give me the eye-roll and we're still friends.

Draft beers were $3, I think, and that included Four Peaks' Kilt Lifter, but that's not what I ordered.  Instead, I tried a glass of the sauvignon blanc- quite nice!  Too bad glasses of wine aren't included in the happy hour menu...

I also ordered the chopped salad, of which the bartender rattled off a list of ingredients and sounded very sure she named everything, so I asked that a couple be omitted.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=-_VmkG-T6ywOWBoVMb5Vhg#-_VmkG-T6ywOWBoVMb5Vhg  Either I missed her mentioning a specific nut (I doubt it!), or she forgot.  Was able to pick most of them off, but still managed to eat a few that were hiding between the greens.  Salad was OK, nothing spectacular.  Probably wouldn't order it again, unless I was running short on veggie servings for the day.  Coworker tried the Korean Beef on a Stick app.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/culinary-dropout-scottsdale-4?select=mMBaBHk1OEvp2bspuUtl5A#mMBaBHk1OEvp2bspuUtl5A  The menu didn't lie, it was one stick of Korean beef.  For $6, I thought the price was a bit too high, but my friend really enjoyed it.  

Based on what we tried today, I'd say it's best to just stick with the dinner menu.  However, I am not giving up on HH, yet, and I plan to try two or three more items soon.

Note: Happy hour menu prices online needs to be updated."}
{"text":"Such a fun group of people that work here. Food is awesome and price is good too! Highly recommend. Been here for lunch and dinner. I'm sure you need reservations for the evening. 
Come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"After a 2 hour horse back riding session in the \"desert\" me and the group of people I was with needed a place to chow down. Someone suggested we go somewhere in downtown Scottsdale which apparently is really fancy/upscale. 

I'm pretty the Restaurant name kinda throws some people off about what type of food/quality of service that they offer. The outside has a nice sandstone finish to it with these giant pillars; it almost looks like a modern day palace. The inside decor was something I didn't expect. It had a very dark/gothic feel to it with black leather chairs and hanging chandeliers. 

Our waiter was very casual and for the most part attentive to our needs. The atmosphere is more laid back and our waiter gave us a few recommendations and was able to inform us of exactly what dish was what.

There's a mystery Brown Beer Bag special where you can pay 2 bucks and you get a random beer in the brown lunch bag (which sounds like fun/crazy, but I dont drink, lolz). For an appetizer we all shared the Pretzels with Cheese Fondue... OMG that may be one of THE best appetizers in recent memory. The pretzel bites were warm, soft, and the sprinkled sea salt was a great addition. Dip that into the Provolone Cheese and it is a mouthful of wonderfulness. I could have easily eaten that whole appetizer by myself had I not ordered my entree. 

I got the fried chicken, which apparently is VERY good. The fried chicken did not disappoint. The chicken itself was very moist and tender and the chicken skin was absolutely delicious. The chicken skin was lightly fried and had a hint of honey to it. Chicken came with a thigh, breast and a leg and two buttermilk biscuits; could have easily been shared by two people. My only small complaint was that the chicken could have used a little bit more seasoning, if it wasn't for the chicken skin, it would have been game over for me. 

My girlfriend got the pork ribs and it seemed like a good idea, but in the end, it probably wasn't... first off this is a WHOLE rack of ribs so it is definitely a two person entree. The sauce was almost a little too sweet and the ribs itself didn't offer anything to rave about. It tasted good, but not great. 

Prices are a little steep with most of the main entrees starting at 15+. The name kinda disappointing b/c I was expecting unusual flavor combinations but it wasn't there. Overall, I enjoyed my meal and would go back for those pretzels and cheese, yum!"}
{"text":"Very cool relaxed atmosphere. Live music, good unique menu items. Nothing too exciting that I would mention other than they had free valet parking."}
{"text":"Our food was good and served very fast. Limited menu. I asked if there were any specials.  No none on the weekend.  I had fish and chips. It was  quite good. Nice place better experiance than the first time.. try it solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great night out. The service was off the chart. I had the ribs, it was more than I could finish. We started with wings, you need to try them!. My wife had the ravioli,  she said it was the best. Sweet corn ravioli.
Finished the night with banana pie. Wow. I could get just the pie next time!"}
{"text":"Being an ASU student, Culinary Dropout was one of the first restaurants that I went to in Tempe. It was so inviting, the staff is always very nice and attentive no matter how busy they may be. Let me tell you, this place gets busy. Try to make a reservation if you can, or be prepared to wait awhile on busy nights.

Some of my favorite items on their menu are the meatloaf and fried chicken. I know, delicious meatloaf, what? It is SO good, you will not be disappointed. Secondly, the fried chicken has a honey glazed taste to it, which literally is making my stomach growl as I'm typing this. My all time favorite though- is the pretzels and fondue appetizer. This is my friend's and I's guilty pleasure, and after a hard week of studying, this is what I look forward to!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 20 times now and they have service down. If you want to be served right away by some great and friendly staff, sit at the bar. Once we figured this out, we have been back many times and really love this place."}
{"text":"I am from Wisconsin and was visiting a friend who moved to Phoenix awhile back. We had driven by The Yard during the day and thought it looked like an interesting place to check out. Later that night when we did, we were not disappointed! I loved how big the bar was-made it easy to find a spot and get some drinks. The bartender was kind and professional and he refilled our drinks in a timely manner. My friend's boyfriend ordered a burger-which he loved. After a few drinks we ventured to The Yard portion of the establishment. I love how you can bring your drinks over to play bags, fooseball, ping pong...you name it. They had a photobooth which was utilized quite a few times. Overall, Culinary Dropout was a great time! I kept telling my friends that I wish Wisconsin had a similar restaurant. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Came in late for dinner while on a business trip. Fun vibe, good service, good beer and a tasty seared ahi salad."}
{"text":"This was our second dinner experience and we couldn't have asked for any better. The staff are extremely personable and inviting. The food and drinks are to die for! If we lived closer this would be a regular hangout for us."}
{"text":"Always amazing. Always worth it. 

I have been to the Phoenix location before, but this was my first time at the Tempe location. I came here for a friend's birthday, who is clearly in college.  There were pretzels, and cheese, and ribs, and live music. 

It was great.  

Thanks for another awesome time Dropout! :)"}
{"text":"We showed up last night for a party of 15 on a cool September night without a reservation (dick I know), and they were 100% able to accommodate our party.  After we ate inside, we went out to the Yard and played ping pong forever.  

Culinary Dropout is AMAZING, the food, the drinks, the service. They really try their damnedest to fulfill every need. Plus, the Yard is the best place to segway for an after party.  

My biggest problem is that I have not yet tried the restaurants next to Culinary, but the entire place is amazing and a good time. Definitely check it"}
{"text":"I prefer the Culinary Dropout that is attached to The Yard in Central Phoenix. The enviornment on the weekends is great. Always busy, good drinks, food and music. Plus they have this awesome photo booth machine that you can upload, email and text your pictures from. They do close at 12am so that's the only downfall!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 4 because I love quality service and our server GINA was a sweet heart. Im not a fan of the menu however take a look for yourself as it is a very loved place by many. Im attached to the vibe, killer/reliable service,  and the mixology and drink choices are robust. I rarely eat a sandwich or salad so please be your own judge for the food. The vibe, drinks, and service are fantastic."}
{"text":"Went here during spring training. I like the atmosphere and the food. However, the hostesses need to learn how to estimate timing a little better. They told us (we were a group of 8.. so quite large, I know) 30 minutes. We were fine to wait 30 minutes.. the 2 hour wait was a little irritating. They did make up for it with their soft pretzels & provolone Fondue, which I might say was damn good. 

I ordered the ricotta gnocci which was also amazing. The portions are quite large, so I didn't get to finish. I'm definitely going back when I hit up spring training next year. And next year I'll be with boys so they'll be able to order in very (VERY) large portions."}
{"text":"I really didn't like the service. \"Mean girls service style\" :D food was ok. And actually 3 stars just because of the environment. Really cozy, fancy, stylish."}
{"text":"This restaurant has such a cool hip vibe. I love the decor and the lights. I had the Caesar salad with crispy shrimp and chips. The drinks were my favourite! Cool spot to come with friends, grab some drinks and a small bite while having a good time. Will come back when I visit Arizona again!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Scottsdale!!! My husband and I came here for a quick bite to eat for lunch before our flight out. However we had wished we had came for dinner the night before instead of the other restaurant we had pick. The atmosphere was to die for and we were able to get a seat on the deck. One odd thing was that all the waitresses all wearing normal clothes so at the beginning we weren't really sure who our waitress was. However we had the most sweetest, down to earth, lovely waitress ever. All the food was great and the appetizer selection worked great for sharing. And we loved all the food we had. We will definitely come back to culinary dropout next time in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Better than average bar food. The pretzel fondue is good for sharing with a table. I've been there several times & service can be a little slow. I've had a range of very helpful to completely inattentive servers. The enormous parking lot is a huge plus - way easier to come & go than other places on/close to Mill.

The Yard offers something for everyone - great for HH with coworkers, playing ping-pong with the family, or sitting around the cozy firepits *these can be turned off if little ones are around - not exactly toddler- friendly."}
{"text":"We have one here in Scottsdale yet I have never been. Our buddy had eaten here the night before and was raving about it and then I realized what he was talking about and got excited myself since this would be my first time.

Cool location in the hotel as it opens up into this pool area with a cool patio. Food was awesome. I had the turkey ruben and would definitely get it again. Its a big portion so I easily could have shared. 

They were having issues with their carbonation for their drinks but the waiter was cool about it and made up for it so we were pleased."}
{"text":"Top notch! We had a large party that continued to grow. Hank and company made sure we were all comfortable and  taken care of they didn't miss a beat. This is definitely the place to go when celebrating with a large group or just catching up with a couple buddies."}
{"text":"All of the times I've been here something has gone wrong, but I wanted to give them one more chance before writing a review. Well that chance proved for a third and final time that I won't be visiting here much.

First time I went there I had a waiter who ignored my table almost the entire night. I had the turkey pastrami sandwich (which is normally a big hit) and found the flavors to be all wrong. I couldn't eat any of it. 

Second time around my table ordered the antipasti meat and cheese board, which was delicious. The heirloom tomatoes were my favorite. I had the bourbon pie to end the night and that was also a big hit with me. But again, the service was awful and we were ignored most of the evening.

Upon my recent trip there, the restaurant took out everything I loved. The bourbon pie, the heirloom tomatoes, this certain kind of amazing cheese...they've all been taken off the menu. Those were the only reasons I came back. Now they're gone. 

Oh well, I had already sat down. Might as well try the new menu item, cheddar and potato pierogies, right? Wrong. For $10, you only get 3 tiny pierogies. Are you kidding me?? It's also under the \"shareable\" items. How in the world do you split three tiny dumplings with any kind of group? It's ridiculous and a ripoff. 

It was such a disappointment and now there's no reason for me to return to this place in the future."}
{"text":"One of my favorites places to eat. My only complaint is that they close a little early for a bar/ outdoor patio"}
{"text":"First time I have ever been here and I just loved the large patio area and fire pits to hang around. You need to have reservations in order to get a seat anywhere because it is a very busy place. We ordered food from Culinary Dropout & I had one of their BBQ bacon burger and it was one of the best ones I ever had. They also have a great selection of brews on tap to chose from. There are bean bag games and ping pong tables but you need to reserve them when you get there. They have free valet parking so keep in mind the parking can be a real issue when it gets busy since there is not much anywhere else to park."}
{"text":"Love Culinary Dropout.
Good drinks and food is awesome. 
It gets busy but the staff will always help you out if you just ask them for what you need. Every server I've gotten has had an amazing sense of humor which just adds to the atmosphere. 

PS the Brussels Sprouts are bomb."}
{"text":"We arrived to our hotel and wanted to get something to eat. Our hotel has many places so we picked this place. We walked in and got seated in the outside patio. They had fire pits on so we asked if they can turn them off and they did. They were very accommodating and friendly. We looked over the menu and placed our drink orders. There drinks are a must try. We had the el matador that was made with tequila and my wife had the original drop out. They were both under the mule section but didn't come in copper mugs. Both very tasty and refreshing. 

Pretzel bites w/ fondue - these were very tasty. You get pretzel balls with a side of cheese fondu. Dip the pretzel in that cheese and such a great combination. Just an FYI it's a lot of pretzel so if your a party of 3-4 then this is just right. Any less then 3 it's a lot of food. 

Fried Chicken - the fried chicken looked amazing but something about the seasoning they use on the chicken I was not a fan of. It had like a sweet element to it that I really didn't enjoy. The chicken itself once past the sling was good and juicy. The buttermilk biscuit was ok and there was a side of mash potatoes that were a little to salty and some slaw that was just ok. My wife enjoyed it so give it a try you might too. 

BBQ pork belly nachos - black beans, guacamole, sour cream and Pico de Gallo. On top of some crispy tortilla chips with chunks of pork belly. These were good and tasty and piel belly was very tender and good. Covered with some type of queso that tied everything together. I preferred these over the friend chicken. 

If in the hard rock and looking for something to eat and grab a drink give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Highly recommend the potato rolls with fondue. It was a little loud because of the music but the outside patio was well cooled off and not wet from the misters."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and FANTASTIC service. From the host taking our seating request to the bartender that bluntly told us what drinks were great and which ones we might not like as much, to the awesome waitress that sat down with us and gave us advice on where to look for housing in the area, what things to do, and generally was just incredibly pleasant, Culinary Dropout has some amazing staff that alone elevated the eating experience. The drinks were great, even the shandies, were perfect in the pleasant Arizona heat. The mules were delightful, without the pretentious copper mugs. We only had the appetizers, but they were so generous, we shared four among us and couldn't finish them all. The Jamón Ibérico on the charcuterie plate was delicious, the mussels with chorizo to die for and the Korean inspired pork belly appetizer was amazing. I'm normally not a big fan of pretzels and cheese dip, but these guys do it right with small pretzel rolls that come out warm and a cheese dip that actually tastes like real cheese and not some artificial stand-in. 

This place is great. Bottom line. If you're in Phoenix or Scottsdale, it is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly good. At first glance it looked over cooked. The atmosphere What is more for hipsters and not a family."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Food and drinks are excellent, staff is friendly, atmosphere is relaxing yet energizing. Live music on occasion. It's been a \"go to\" spot for me for years."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved eating here at the College Dropout. The atmosphere was great and the service was top notch. Drinks were refilled quickly and our server was very attentive.

To start off, I went with the soft pretzels with fondue cheese for appetizer. The cheese was great! I also ordered the antipasti plate, which consisted of asparagus with balsamic dressing, prosciutto, marcona almonds, marinated olives, and homemade ciabatta. It was a very healthy plate, and it tasted great with the hot wings that I ordered too. The hot wings had mustard seed, buffalo sauce, shaved carrots, and celery. Pretty flavourful wings, definitely has a kick to it. My friend seemed to enjoy the turkey pastrami, and she finished it all!

Overall cool atmosphere, great service, and great food!"}
{"text":"Love going to the location on 7th Street so when I was able to make it out to the Tempe location, I was psyched. It's in a great location and is huge! If I still lived in Tempe, I would be here all the time. Great food, great drinks, great happy hour. Don't forget to order the pretzels & fondue!"}
{"text":"My favorite place. Outstanding food and drinks. A more sophisticated place to have great time than any place on mill."}
{"text":"Today is my 50th birthday and we had reservations at a steak place at the hard rock hotel when we entered it was so stuffy and terrible that we decided to go someplace else and we happened upon Wesley at the culinary dropout And not only was the service amazing the drinks were amazing the food was out rages this is the best birthday ever thank you guys at culinary dropout for making my 50th awesome!  We absolutely love the Weslyan will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wondered around the area of Scottsdale near my hotel (The FireSky Resort) and saw this place. The name intrigued me and a search on my mobile device's Yelp app revealed that the place had 4 1/2 stars. Dinner decision made! I walked in and was seated promptly into a pretty comfy leather bench/sofa facing the bar and tvs. I looked at the menu and was pointed to the menus indication of their specialties (indicated with two red stars). I felt adventurous and ordered the fried chicken. Great choice! (If I do say so myself) It was cooked nicely and was paired with coleslaw and mashed potatoes and gravy as well as with a roll/biscuit (that tasted like honey was baked in it). It was like a meal from KFC but way classier and tastier!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, once for happy hour after work, and once for lunch on a weekend with some friends.

First time was like 3 star experience... decent amount of beers on tap and solid happy hour food list. The bartender was a chick who was cute and was able to shoot the shit with us pretty well, I was impressed.

The look and decor of the place is impressive and swanky, reminds me of back home in LA. 

As I was ready to leave, it was pretty busy, and there was a huge group of older guys. Above average first experience.

The second time was on a Saturday a couple weeks ago and my buddies wanted to check out a cool spot for food and drinks in Scottsdale so I took them here and it ended up being a good call.

For lunch, this place is awesome as we got to sit outside on the couches, got some GREAT cocktails (not cheap though) and my Pork Belly was really good.

1st experience 3 stars, nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either.

2nd experience, 5 stars, chill lunch atmosphere with good food and good drinks...

If this place was a bit cheaper I'd give it 5 stars but I will return regardless."}
{"text":"Recently came here for dinner with my boyfriend and was certainly not disappointed! The service is great! The host, bartender and waiter were all so friendly and helpful with answering all our questions.

We started off the meal with the pretzel bites after reading everyone else's reviews and trust me they are DELICIOUS! They are quite filling though so make sure to not get too full off of them.

For entrees we had the French dip and butternut cannelloni. Both were good so no complaints there!  

We finished off the meal with the bread pudding which was also tasty. I like that it wasn't too sweet and was great for sharing. 

I highly recommend this place! Especially for weekday happy hours or live music on the weekends!"}
{"text":"waited 45 minutes before a rude waitress who finally approached me and asked me if I wanted anything! really?! what else would I want? a menu would be a good start...and let's not talk about the nasty cold food that's overpriced for the quality. Only good thing is the unique decor. THAT'S IT!"}
{"text":"Matt is the best bartender ever.  I am hooked!  We spent 2 hours eating delicious food, drinking amazing drinks, and watching this bartending ninja work his magic.  This place should charge admittance to watch the insanity.  He was nice enough to explain what he was doing while doing it.  

Cherries soaked in brandy and muddled with sugar cubes?  

Orange zest burnt with a wood match to give the flavor something more complex?

What other place does this sh*t without being arrogant or pompous???

The pretzel bites were amazingly awesome.  The mussels were fan-freaking-tastic (and a steal at only $13).  We had these two appetizers and then split a pastrami sandwich.  It was plenty of food and we left happy.  I'll definitely be heading back."}
{"text":"The food is aight! The fondu didn't impress me at all  :/ However, the concept is really cool! Its a nice place to hangout at... I love the games outside and the free valet is nice too, AND its kid friendly. Big plus in my book :)"}
{"text":"Great service, the food was good and not cookie cutter food, everything was elevated a little.  Tasted great.  It's a little busy, but aren't all good places?"}
{"text":"I have to admit I was a bit hesitant to patronize an establishment called Culinary Dropout in the silicone cultural wasteland of Scottsdale. In a hipster mecca like San Francisco, Seattle or Brooklyn I'd just assume it was ironic but I wasn't sure the target audience would get it.

I'm not sure if it counts as de-gentrification but at least the management gets it. 

Culinary Dropout is, straight up, excellent American comfort food at prices that aren't overall comforting but are reasonable for the neighborhood. The staff, for which a minimum beauty and/or edge standard is strictly enforced (the explanation that best explains a visible mohawk in the open kitchen) are friendly and help it along in a cavernous, moodlit dining room suitable for friends or a date along with a bar boasting live music on weekends and the obligatory fair-weather outdoor seating.

We hit two of the three specialties (the third being a turkey pastrami sandwich on pretzel bread) and a dessert:
- Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue ($10): There's a reason everyone orders this. Fluffy pretzel rolls that are made better with a *small* amount of warm cheese.
- Fried Chicken ($16): What must be multiple pounds of juicy chicken (I'm not sure I'd want to meet the chicken to which the breast piece belonged in a dark alley) with honey-glazed biscuits, mashed potatoes and cole slaw.
- Chocolate Peanut Butter Tart ($6): For lovers of dense and sweet desserts only.

Especially if considering dessert, I'd strongly recommend ordering the pretzels and then one dish less than the number of people - comforting in the United States means heavy and even if I'd just hiked 10+ miles after not eating all day I don't think I could have finished the entire chicken platter. I just as strongly recommend coming though - it is one of the rare cases where my traditionalist meat and potatoes parents and I agree on a restaurant. Culinary Dropout has enough of a sense of humor as it can possibly maintain among plastic \"charm\" and the food makes me a bit wistful for whatever the chef would have produced had s/he not called it quits."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for lunch Monday. We weren't sure they were open because it was basically empty.  We ordered the korean brussel sprouts and they were fantastic.  I had the burger with havarti and bacon. It was massive and delicious.  Mom had the shrimp Ceasar and loved it-large enough that she took half home. The atmosphere is fun.  Our waitress was exceptional,  kept our ice tea full and was very personable."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I wait for my check. Here's some of the problems with my experience tonight: I was harassed by management; I did not get a drink for 30 minutes; I only got one drink the entire time I was here; the food was terrible; the servers were extremely rude and incompetent; and it's been 30 minutes that I've been wanting to pay but haven't been able to. This was a horrible experience and I will never come back."}
{"text":"Our server, Ashlii... Awesome! I have always loved the food but have never wanted to rave about the service since the bartenders here are usually rude and inattentive. Ashlii was on point with everything without being overbearing or in your face every two seconds. So happy the staff has made some changes here!!! Now if only they could work on their bartenders' customer service..."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the cool new places I have had the joy to discover.  Services was great and their food options were wonderful.  I highly recommend their pretzel bites.  Delish!"}
{"text":"I had a great salad for lunch here the other day.  I would go back in a heart beat.  Dish was fresh and full of flavor."}
{"text":"We had couple cocktails here and Matt was very helpful and so much fun! All we tried was so good, I'm a local bartender and this place exceeded my expectations, food was great, service was amazing and cocktails were on point... thanks Matt see you guys soon definitely!!"}
{"text":"Love this place we come here about once a week or every other week usually always get the same things, I like their grilled cheese sliders no bacon/sub avacado, their hummus is great, and cesar kale salad no meat. They have a great atmosphere usually younger people on weekends and a live band(even though its really loud). Great place to come hangout with friends"}
{"text":"I had a killer hangover and was dying for something to help. The bartender made an awesome Bloody Mary that got me to a point where I could eat. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with eggs and bacon which was just what I needed to line my stomach so I could go out and enjoy Vegas for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"Great setting.  Not the usual \"penny pitcher\" Mill Avenue crowd.  This is where I take people when they are visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really fun great place for a first date or even a fifth. Awesome vibe outside patio can get pretty crowded to make sure if you're bringing a large party that you plan ahead. 
Server was awesome
Valet parking complementary
Easy to Uber to and from if needed"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time on New Years Day and I was just in awe. Our hostesses, Sydney + Lauren, were so sweet! There were 4 total in our party and they were so accommodating. One of the girls pulled my chair out for me and at that moment I knew this place had great service. Everything on the menu sounded delicious, but you can't go wrong with the fried chicken. It was perfectly crispy and the mashed potatoes are to die for! Our server was awesome, I just can't remember her name. However, the experience overall was great and I can tell you that I will be a new regular. Keep it up ladies!"}
{"text":"Yes, they have a great happy hour... but it ends at 5pm so that makes it a bit impractical. Which is a real shame because their food and drinks are pretty overpriced. However their specialty cocktails are delicious and they have a great beer selection. On top of that there is plenty of free parking (pretty rare in downtown Tempe) and they even have a valet when they're busy. I've also been here for lunch a few times and have fallen in love with the seared tuna wasabi salad."}
{"text":"We hosted a large group of coworkers here for dinner and I was a little nervous about how the quality of food was going to be (family style); however, it was AMAZING!! We had a few different salads, house chips, PRETZELS & CHEESE (omg), ribs, mash potatoes, fried chicken and biscuits. ALL OF IT WAS AMAZING!! Service was fantastic, even for having a large group.....MK was one of our servers and she was outstanding.
Highly recommend for a fun, laid back environment!! We had a blast and will totally return"}
{"text":"Great service!! Amazing food!! Perfect to hangout loved every minute! Very fairly priced. Try the pretzels they are fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Our kid (29), and his girlfriend, brought us here for dinner and drinks, and we had a great time.  Maybe a tad pricey, but the food, service, and atmosphere was great!!  The nachos were really good, as was the chicken tortilla soup.  Fish and chips were also quite good.  Fun place!!  We'd go again anytime!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed. The atmosphere was a little over a top, but I would expect nothing less for the location.
Allison, our server was great. Honest, efficient, and knowledgable.
My wife and I had some cheese to start, a lovely goat from Vermont, served on perfect bread.
I had the butternut squash canneloni. I would give it a 9.7.
The food was great, resonably priced, I can't wait to return...."}
{"text":"The fried chicken in juicy and on point. Large portions, and the in-house drinks are nice and well priced. Perfect for a Sunday afternoon brunch."}
{"text":"Stopped into the bar and Kyle was amazing. It's nice to see people just being the happiest version of themselves. Definitely will come back for the staff and tasty adult beverages!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed and disrespected. My boyfriend and I work full-time and attend school full-time, we wanted to relax and were eager to try out Culinary Dropout for the first time. We were seated and our server came by to take our order. We each ordered a drink, but to our disbelief our server came back and said my boyfriend was denied a drink by the manager because she saw him stumble walking in while texting on his phone. He stayed up all night writing a final draft for a paper and apparently the tiredness resembled signs of someone too intoxicated to have a beer with his dinner. He personally spoke with the manager Hailey and holding a perfectly coherent conversation about how he hasn't had a drink in over a week and would like to just enjoy his night. Explaining he didn't get a minute of sleep she was so quick to cut him off when he was speaking and completely deny any chance of him getting a drink. With over 15 years of experience in the service industry i have yet to even have seen anybody be cutoff even before beginning. I have seen customers at fellow Fox concept restaurants become completely belligerent before being denied a drink, yet my tired boyfriend cannot enjoy a night out. Seriously have I never felt so disrespected by an establishment in my entire life."}
{"text":"I love this spot for hh. $3 mug beer (not too bad of a selection), a good variety of apps for $6. The pretzel fondue is a MUST - it changed my view of pretzels and cheese! Everything we ordered was good, service was pretty good and it's a nice area to enjoy outdoor dining. Check it out for HH!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the service is spectacular and the food is beyond up to par! I've had the meatloaf, steak, fish and chips, salmon, and pretzels and fondue. The prices are extremely good for the quality of food. I just hope that it stays this way. I love the atmosphere as well. I would recommend Culinary Dropout for business meetings and any kind of gathering. Lol. The attire could be from casual- business formal. On Thursdays-Saturday's there is a live band that plays and that's always nice to have!"}
{"text":"Kel and Adam accommodated a large party (20+) for my birthday. They helped us find an area large enough to seat everyone, were extremely attentive to our needs, and balanced delivering orders to us despite constantly changing seats. Amazing service and great food!"}
{"text":"Good spot to hang out with friends and spend a couple of hours. Good range of drinks and great sandwiches. Should probably stay off beer battered fish."}
{"text":"yummy pretzel fondue, good atmosphere, good customer service...they should switch up their selection every now and then. After a few visits, you find the one think you \"like\"...but its usually just a \"like\"....

When you order a burger, ask for the pretzel bun - delish!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit.  Have visited the Phoenix location numerous times and this is quite comparable. Service was good, location and atmosphere are the comparable."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out for my best friend's 22nd birthday, but I was really disappointed. We had a reservation for 12 people, but the birthday girl and I got there 5 minutes early so we could sit at the table and be ready when everyone got there. The hostess was very rude and said we were too early and that we needed at least half of our party to be seated. Firstly, 5 minutes is too early?!?! Secondly, when we had 5 people she would not seat us, because we needed 1 more person... 
When we finally had 7 people she looked us up and down very disapprovingly (probably because we weren't in skimpy clothes) and walked us to our table.
The place was packed and very busy, and our waiter was running around a little frantic. I understand it's busy, so that didn't bother me much. He was really great and said happy birthday to the birthday girl and apologized for not coming sooner. We all ordered some pretzel bread, which was amazingggg, and some drinks and he was really excited for us to be there. However, we didn't order a second round of drinks and he got very cold and started to become almost rude. Apparently if you're not a big drinker don't go there, even if you order $300 worth of food. Overall, wouldn't go back or recommend, but the decor was awesome."}
{"text":"What more is there to say than Pretzel Bites with Provolone Fondue...amazing!

Sure Hard Rock Hotel is a bit out of the way, but if you're looking for a snack that will make your heart sing, go for the pretzel bites. That's pretty much all we got, and I'd still make a trip back for them. Yes, they are that good."}
{"text":"The ambience, the staff & food were all excellent. Some Yelp review have critiqued the loud atmosphere, but I found that that wasn't a problem. The pretzels to start with were carbtastic, if anything a little salty. I ordered the Fried Chicken & even though the waitress warned it would take a bit longer, it actually came out at the same time as the Pub burger (which my friend ordered) in less than 15 minutes. The chicken had amazing flavor, but wasn't easy to eat & had a LOT of bones. The honey biscuit was flavorful as well, and the coleslaw added fresh, crunchy texture to the mix. 

I visited again the next week with a huge group of friends & wasn't as hungry as I was the previous week, so I ordered the pretzels & split a chicken caesar salad. My second experience at Culinary Dropout was disappointing. The chicken caesar was extremely poor, they forgot the chicken & there were very few croutons. That second experience made me edit my previous review; I don't need to go back to Culinary Dropout again."}
{"text":"We went here to try the restaurant week menu, and left very satisfied and full! For $30 you get your choice of 3 appetizers (Pretzel bread with fondue, Caesar salad, French onion soup), 4 entrees (Ribs, fried chicken, salmon, sweet corn cannelloni), and various desserts (Salted caramel custard, apple monkey bread, chocolate toffee tart).  A mug of beer on tap or a paper-bag beer is also included in your $30, which makes it a great deal!  I had the pretzel bread with cheese fondue, which was a sizable portion, with soft, salted bread and smooth, tasty cheese.  Another person had ordered the Caesar salad, which was decent, but nothing extraordinary.  For the main course I had the salmon, which was decent.  It was cooked well, very tender, and it was served with apples, fennel, and some sweet glazed wheatberries.  For me, it was a tad too sweet due to the apples and sweet wheatberries, and the portion was small compared to the normal price of the meal ($20).  I tried the ribs which were nice and tender, and the chicken, which kind of reminded me of KFC original recipe, except with better quality, more tender chicken.  For dessert we shared some apple monkey bread and the chocolate toffee tart.  Both were delicious.

I think if I were paying full price for all these items, it would be a 3 star experience for me.  Since we got so much for $30, it was definitely worth trying this restaurant out for restaurant week.  Would I go here again?  I would probably go here to try out their happy hour, or maybe to get a light meal and also try some of their interesting sounding cocktails."}
{"text":"We had a 5:45 reservation on a Friday and glad we did - the place filled up after 6pm.  Ordered the homemade potato chips and dip; and 6 shrimp from the raw bar for appetizers.  For $7 I expected more chips that what we were served.  THE SHRIMP WERE NOT PEELED. Or De-veined.  (If you like your cocktail sauce on the spicy side, ask for some horseradish.)  And, there were no \"wet-naps\" or any way to wipe your hands after handling the shrimp, which lead to a trip to the restroom to wash my hands . . . but there isn't a restroom inside this restaurant.  You get sent to a bathroom in the casino that's a bit of a hike and hard to find, now that there's extra signage and stanchions/guest control in the casino for the Magic Mike show.  

We ordered the fried chicken and corn ravioli entrees and our food was good.  We added chicken to the ravioli entree and it was just sliced chicken plopped on top if the pasta and not integrated into the dish in any way.  The fried chicken was good; there were three pieces (thigh, leg, breast) and even the white meat was cooked perfect.

This restaurant is open to the pool and has an outdoor patio with a few bar games.  People were loud, plus there were several TVs tuned to sports and then a female violin trio playing alternative covers started playing. They were very good but hard to hear.  And, there were several groups of bachelorettes in the restaurant that were loud; the Magic Mike show is bringing in these groups.  

If I try this place again, will come for lunch or on a weeknight. Would love to try one of the sandwiches.  Next time."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the place was excellent. It was a 35 min wait for a table but bar seating is a great option and we got seated quickly. The wait staff was very attentive and the menu selection is a great mix of bar food and some others. Didn't get a chance to try any of the meat or cheese plates but will definitely have to next time. We had the Korean style Brussel Sprouts, deviled eggs, chips, honey fried chicken and the ribeye cap. I expected honey on the side for the fried chicken but it was still good and the cap was fantastic. The entrance is not on the street side but on the railroad side and a little confusing so just watch out!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

Culinary Dropout is similar to me in that it has an Identity Crisis. It is located in a Mall, has hipster servers, luxe/goth furnishing, sports playing on TV and pop music. So what are you? 

Was excited to try this place because I had heard so many good things, but the food ended up being only okay. I had the turkey pastrami sandwich and an Arnold Palmer. 

Maybe I'm being a little snobby, but it is still hard for me to get over that it is located in a mall. 

My other half got the paper bag beer which is $2 and was probably the best part. He was positive it was a Mexican beer, but it was from the good old Wisconsin (Hamms), so much for his Mexican roots. I guess they do this with shots too for $6. 

I do want to come back to try some of the drinks. They have a large drink menu and they all looked super yummy. 

If you are daring try Yesterday's Soup. I'm sure it is still fresh. :)"}
{"text":"The squash pasta & Gorgonzola salad were amazing! I wasn't impressed the first time. I loved the atmosphere though. Super fun & chill!!! So we tried it again. But after my second visit I'll definitely be back again!!! Love this place for hanging with friends!"}
{"text":"I do not understand why is this restaurant so highly rated. Let me be clear, the place is not terrible, but it is definitely not a four star place. The ambiance and atmosphere are great. This is a great place to come with a large group of friend and enjoy nice drinks. However, the food is not all there. I was very disappointed with the food options. I ordered their popular cheese and pretzels. The cheese was good, and for a large party it might be a good option. However, there is really nothing overly special about it. 
I also had the tuna salad, well that was actually very good. But not everyone can eat the salad for a whole meal. I ordered the Meat Loft and it was just ok. I would not recommend it at all. 
Truly, the restaurant is not terrible. However, this is Las Vegas, and there are so many more options out there that it's probably not worth coming back."}
{"text":"Interesting name for a restaurant.  

I wondered over here and wanted to try this place it out. 
It looks very inviting from the outside and I was seated pretty quickly.

The food is great but the place is overpriced,  really there didn't seem to be anything special or distinct about the place. 

Its a solid option for groups or families that want a great meal near the mall, but honestly I think you could find better or more interesting options nearby.

I'm only being really picky about this place because there are just SO MANY good resturants near the mall. 

It's a good option.  I'll come back."}
{"text":"I've had one positive and one somewhat negative experience at this location. The first time I came here with a large group for a birthday and the second time was just with my girlfriend. When we were told we had a 45 minute wait, we waited an hour for a text that never came, since they never put us on their list.

Unfortunately, while we received excellent service from our first server, our second server, Richard, was slow to take orders and get our food out. While I loved the fried chicken when I first got it, the second time when my girlfriend got the dish it was lacking its signature honey drizzle and thus, lacked some needed flavor. The restaurant was kind enough to take this off our tab since our food took a while to come out. 

The pork nachos were good and the monkey bread was good as well, but nothing special. My ribs were good, not great. Ultimately, I am giving three stars because while I love the atmosphere, the restaurant seems to care more about big groups and outside of its few signature dishes, the rest of the food is only average. Considering the prices on the menu, it seems that people go for the atmosphere rather than the food."}
{"text":"Don't get Breonna as your server. Didn't ask if we wanted another drink after we decided to stick to appetizers. She didn't appear to know where the water was or remembered we were at one of her tables. Food was good as always."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fabulous and the service really delivers here. Has a energetic atmosphere to it as well which I love. I will definitely come back here and would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"What I love most about this place is that they separate 21+ from those college kids who are still sagging their pants or wearing bro tanks. just kidding....kind of.

Anyway, I LOVE the atmosphere here wherever you sit. Indoors is a little fancier, and you'll wait for a seat while outside is first come first serve. The few times I have been, there has been live music inside, which is a nice touch. As a tip, the tables towards the middle are of the outside patio are cooler than those on the outside. There are corn hole boards, ping pong tables, couches, and comfortable seating outside where it truly feels like a backyard party. 

Food: Overall, the menu is a little lackluster for me. There are few options, and the portions are small for the price, but it is still tasty. The food is good, but the dessert is better. This is where their menu truly shines. I promise you, you won't regret ANY of those three lovely desserts.

Drinks: Ok, so a glass of their cheapest wine is the price of a bottle of wine, so I would avoid ordering wine unless you want to show off. Their mixed drink menu is where you should focus your attention. They have a variety of \"mules\" that you should get. All of them. In one sitting. Then call a lyft because no drinking and driving, friends.

Anyway, this is definitely a fun, interactive bar that can accommodate many different types of personalities."}
{"text":"Culinary dropout does have delicious pretzel rolls and cheese dip- I cannot lie. However- it's really loud and overpriced. Good - but expect to drop $70-100 for two if you get food and drinks."}
{"text":"Great location, artsy, cool, fresh, and it won't break your bank. Appetizers were great as well as their beer selection, and the ambience was fun."}
{"text":"First off I have to say this place is fun and a great place to hang out with a bunch of buddies. That said, after all the rave reviews and hullabaloo with their food tasting amazing I was pretty disappointed.  I was not impressed and would probably not even get an entree next time. Our appetizer was average at best and the entree was no better. 
As for the seating, we had a fire pit and played cornhole while we waited for our food. It was a lot of fun!  Too bad the food was a disappointment..."}
{"text":"Love this place normally, but had horrible service at the Tempe location on a Thursday night. We were there for 3+  hours because our waiter would disappear for long periods of time. He forgot our pretzels and then gave us the wrong dessert to go. He simply wasn't listening or even looking at us when we were ordering which I think is the reason why we had so many mistakes with our orders.

I'm just going to stick with the Scottsdale location from now on. They have great service and food!"}
{"text":"Huge restaurant, awesome food, cool atmosphere! Live music setup available as well as TV's. Great place for a large group."}
{"text":"stopped in on a friday night and the place was packed. (and loud as hell - who woulda thought acoustic could rock so loud?)

we asked the girl how long the wait was and she said 10-15 minutes. i have now discerned that a hostess saying \"10-15 minutes\" is like a drunk person telling the cop he only had \"a couple beers.\" the wait took over a half hour, i think, though i am not faulting them for that. it was cool that they took my cell number and called me when the table was ready . . . gave us some time to wander along the canal, i mean waterfront.

the waiter was really helpful about the different cheeses and what would be too strong or soft or whatever you like/ dont like.

we split an entree and it arrived in like 3 minutes. super quick. the antipasta stuff took a bit longer. makes sense, this is the perfect place to go and have some drinks and just snack on the antipasta . . . not many people ordering a meal at this time. i mean, if youre a $30k millionaire, you dont want some prowling cougar to see you stuffing your face. they dont like that. you want to be aloof and swarmy. i mean smooth. plus, you can always impress the cougar at the next table with your pronunciation of certain fancy cheeses. they do like that.

great seating outside, comfy couch-like seats and space heaters. the food was eh, though the fries were awesome. i would probably go back if i was in the area and wanted something light to go with some drinks and just kick back. not sure i would go to scottsdale just for this place though."}
{"text":"Great place for hang out playing games with friends and family! Delicious food, best Bloody Mary's!!!"}
{"text":"The pretzel bites are off the chain. My wife loves their Kale salad. I also really like the deviled eggs."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow because of the bar and the kitchen.  The waiter seemed like he was in a fog.  We sat for 10 minutes waiting for water (and had to ask for it), 20 minutes for drinks and 45 minutes for our food.  When the food finally came, there was very little of it for the cost. We asked for the manager's help...she disappeared.  I will not come back here again!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. Whenever I have a chance to go here for lunch, I do. Their pretzels and cheese appetizer is to die for. Every single item I've chosen for lunch has been fantastic. I have had their salads - good. I have had their sandwiches - great. I have had their burgers - also great. The service is always top notch and I love the open atmosphere and modern decor as well. I will continue to suggest this place to out of towner's and whenever I get to choose the lunch spot at work, I choose Culinary Dropout. Love love love."}
{"text":"OMGEEEEEEE!  Freaking phenomenal food. My tummy is so happy right now. Me and my crew had the homemade pretzels with cheese, turkey pastrami, fried chicken, kale salad and a cocktail called Pistols at Dawn (oh-so -gingery and delicious)."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. I have tried almost everything on their menu and my absolute favorite item is the mussels. Absolutely divine broth to dip the large crustini in. I also like their roasted beets, cured meats and other antipasto plates. Everything else is soso. Would recommend to try at least once."}
{"text":"While I would like to give this restaurant five stars I truly can't due to the service I received. Several coworkers and myself decided to try this place after a long day and to put it lightly the service was not up to par. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with no bacon and a side salad. What I received was a chicken sandwich with bacon and fries. The server didn't write any of our orders down and rarely checked the table. He did not seem to notice that I really didn't touch my food while they were simple mistakes it was enough to make me lose my appetite. I removed the bacon and had a couple bites the food tasted delicious however the service was truly awful. I hope they improve considering this restaurant was highly recommended to me by locals I feel I need to try another location and hope for better!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food! Culinary Dropout is a solid place to go after work to grab some drinks and a bite to eat. The indoor area is really nice and almost has a \"formal\" feel to it. The outside area is a bit more casual and fun. There are plenty of places to sit and it's great for groups! My only complaint is that the service can be a bit slow, but it's not bad enough to make me give them any less than 5 stars.

They also have live music sometimes, which is phenomenal (not enough places have live music). They also offer valet parking which is nice considering that the parking lot is on the other end of the building.

Overall, this place is great!"}
{"text":"I honestly do not understand why people like this place. Cheese Whiz as an appetizer? I thought it would be a gourmet version because the waiter raved about it. This is just odd. As a novelty it's cute, but I can't imagine really wanting to eat this type of food over and over!"}
{"text":"I almost didn't want to write a review making even more people head that way lol but oh my god this place is awesome.  It was super busy and now I know why.  Food was nothing short of amazing and the atmosphere was amazing as well.  To top it off we played a game of ping pong when done.  If your looking for a great spot to go give it a shot."}
{"text":"We loved this place!  Everything was better than it needed to be, by a couple of notches!  We had olives, cheese, and serrano ham, along with a salad, and it was all delightful, perfectly tasty. The outdoor seating was perfect."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in phoenix. the food is always good, the service is unfortunately always slow, but the food, like I said, GOOD!"}
{"text":"This is just a great place to go. The food, drinks and atmosphere here are just unlike anything else in Phoenix. I am always happy with the Turkey Pastrami Sandwhich and the Pretzel bites- you cannot go wrong!

Make sure to get there early if you are with a large party- they do not take reservations!"}
{"text":"Had a great end to the 4th of July holiday with dinner here.  The night before, I was at another restaurant and ordered ribeye... THE RIBEYE STEAK AT THE OTHER RESTAURANT HAD NO RIBEYE CAP!!!  WTH!!!!!!  You can imagine my disappointment since a ribeye without the cap is like a car without wheels.  Then, my brother brought me here to Culinary Dropout... where RIBEYE CAP is rightfully an entree all to its own.  The ribeye cap had an Asian flavor with slight oyster sauce - not overpowering though.  The veggies with it were excellent too!"}
{"text":"omg not good service Tempe location is hands down better very disappointing after such a good experience in Tempe"}
{"text":"Great service, tons of fake body parts. No parking."}
{"text":"I really have no complaints about the food. It's the consistently abysmal service that has finally pushed me to voice my concern on yelp. I have been to this establishment at many different times of day and levels of busyness, and it does not seem to matter if it is a Wednesday at 2pm or a Saturday night during an ASU game, the service is a joke. Nearly impossible to get your waiter's attention even IF you can find your waiter. Last night I did not even have my water refilled once! My group had booked an escape room activity nearby on Mill Ave after our dinner of which we very nearly missed because it took so incredibly long to track down our server and get our checks. The only times I've ever been pushed to not tip a server due to comically bad service has been at this place. And it's too bad because the food is agreeable and the venue is very nice as well."}
{"text":"Amazingly good. Fun spin on food. Great cocktails. A truly unique and awesome dining experience. Next time I want to try the pretzel bite fondue. It looks amazing!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place. The cocktails were great although the atmosphere may have been a little loud. We sat outside, so it's nice that they have a mister system that's up for the challenge. 

We had the antipasti, the best of which was a tie between the beets, deviled eggs, and Korean Brussels sprouts. Overall everyone was happy with their meal. 

If you like tequila, they have the Clase Azul Reposado. It isn't cheap, but it goes down smooth!"}
{"text":"This place is a little over hyped.  The food is decent and the setting can be fun.  However, the massive crowds and wait times can detract from the experience.   If you can find a less crowded time, it would make the experience far better.  I have not found such."}
{"text":"Every time I visit the Phoenix area I always go to a culinary dropout. It's a perfect blend of socialization, well crafted drinks and delicious food. The pretzels and cheese are too good and I've never had one of their entrees that's wasn't at least Awesome."}
{"text":"First, let me say, I am so happy to have Culinary Dropout open in Tempe in the Farmer Arts District. I think it is going to be an  anchor establishment for lots of other development in this area and talk about a well run establishment, wow, one can almost hear the hum of operational efficiency in how this place is run and it is a big space and so popular! I took my work-team to lunch here today and honestly, no detail is overlooked and I have no doubt that in going here folks will have a consistently positive experience.

As for why it is only marked as A-Ok right now - well, my first time at this location and as with the other culinary dropout I find the food to be good but nothing, at least this time, sent me into foodie heaven. I got the fried chicken and while it was good, a bit sweet for me for some reason. Part of the reason may be that I had the Asian fusion style fried chicken from Welcome Chicken + Donuts the day before and it suffered a bit by comparison. Probably the big thing, the mashed potatoes come across as a bit too smooth - something like mashed new potatoes, done a bit thicker, would be a bit more in alignment with the sort of stomach grabbing mashed potatoes that complement fried chicken - same for the gravy, feels as bit too smoothed out versus say, a thicker gravy with a stronger component of black pepper. 

I will say that the sweet potato cannelloni one of fellow diners had was well received and someone else had the M.A.C. burger and said it was one of her top five burgers. Accordingly, I bet most folks will find the food good enough. If one is a bit more of a foodie I would look to the antipasti menu where one can pick a variety of cured meets, cheeses (including pimento cheese - yum!) and other snacks - I saw some boards of those going out and they looked delicious. 

Oh, the music was at a low (good volume) when my group sat down for lunch at 11:15 and then as things started to get packed, they cranked up the volume - I have a feeling that is meant to help keep things moving quickly or even more likely, I'm becoming a grouchy old guy but keeping music at a reasonable level so that it adds to the ambiance but does not overwhelm or overshadow the level of conversation seems important. 

Key point here, a Yelp review is deeply personal and to some degree we have to throw in a level of \"it connected with me\" as a diner so that is why it is a  three star - I don't hate it but I also don't go - wow, that was an uncommonly good eating experience - I'll make sure to go back a few times and see if things change as I try more things on the menu, including some of the house cocktails - at the end of the day I'm extremely happy to have this establishment in my neighborhood.

P.S. - one thing that was amazing, the apple monkey bread with ice cream dessert -  that was amazing and worth getting again. :-)"}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service
Ordered appetizers that never arrived. Offered free desert and waited 30+ minutes and still waiting, prefer the check so we can leave. Vodka gimlet was not made with Rose lime juice"}
{"text":"Dear Fox Restaurants - I am slightly disappointed in this recently opened Fox creation. I am a fan of your other joints, and this one fell a little flat for me. We went to dinner with some work colleagues. They all seemed to enjoy their meals. But mine was a little disappointing. 

When we arrived my colleagues had already ordered wine and the pretzel appetizer. These were both great. I ordered the gnocchi for my entree - this was were I was disappointed. I think with some work this dish could be great. But it was -- ehh. The gnocchi (which is usually one of my favorite dishes) was a little mushy. I also did not think the sausage and mushrooms blended (taste wise) in the dish. 

I would go back and give this place another shot. Just order something different."}
{"text":"Had a delicious dinner tonight. Had the kale salad which was so fresh and delicious. Added the salmon and it was wonderful. Highly recommend it.  Service was slow and relaxed. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We stopped here as we were passing thru Scottsdale.  I had the fried chicken.  It is marked on the menu as one of their most popular items.  We started with the pretzel fondue.  The pretzel was actually big, puffy, pretzel balls.  They were good, but could have used a little more salt.  The cheese wasn't my favorite.  It seemed a little...grainy, almost like it had been too hot, and it was about ready to break.  Not a smooth fondue cheese.  The fried chicken.  Let me start by saying that it was ok.  It comes with honey drizzled on it.  Sounds great, right?  Well, I could see the honey, but there was zero flavor.  The breading had zero flavor, and the honey had zero flavor.  I was looking for that little sweet kick, and I didn't find it, so I put salt on it, and ate it that way.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were good, the coleslaw was horrid and vinegary (which would have been a nice kick, if thw chicken had a sweetness to it).  The biscuit had a honey drizzle on top.  buttered inside.  It was thick like a biscuit, but, again, flavorless.  

The beer list is great with a bunch of local AZ beers, but thats a drive for us just to go for beer."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. The decor is pretty fancy and typical of Old Town Scottsdale. I'd recommend sitting outdoors if the weather accommodates. 

I had the Soft Pretzel appetizer and the Grilled Cheese sliders. Highly recommened. I hear they have live music on the weekends, so I will have to return to check it out. Definitely a good place to stop on your tour of Scottsdale restaurants fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"First off cool place with great setting but terrible service! First off the young poorly dressed server was uninviting and looked like she might be on drugs. I told her I was very picky about drinks and asked if there Moscow Mule was a traditional one and she said yes. Do our drink comes and it's in a glass really?? Where's the copper cup ? Not one did she ask how we liked our drinks just a bad sever and bad attitude no one ever asked how we were doing etc.   At the end I talked to a guy and he took the drink off but he was still not so warm and friendly."}
{"text":"I know why this is called the culinary dropout!  We got there about 4pm - shift change - tables were dirty - place was too. We say outside. Hostess had to clean the table. Place was 10% full - AKA Empty  - I know why!  We sat down five minutes later and waited...and waited...and waited...finally the hostess comes back to serve us...she was great by the way...I ordered the soup of the day...that was good. My date the house salad...that was good too. Service still spotty though...I ordered the Fish and Chips and my date the steak dish. Fish was soggy, not too hot either and as for the chips, there were only a few on the dish...fish was terrible!  Fries cold as well. The steak was awful as well. The G.M. ought to be fired. The FOH is a mess, staff confused, dress inappropriate, and for the BOH, they are truly dropouts for a reason! What a waste of $60!  Never again!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed when I came here the other day. I have been to the Culinary in Scottsdale so I figured this would be great to. We stopped in for an early dinner, had the rainbow trout and the steak and potatoes. The fish was bland, usually covered in a caramelized sauce, almonds and really tasty, I was actually craving it, that's why we went. It was cooked well, just lacking the caramelized sauce, which unfortunately made the dish a little bland. I was really looking forward to it too :( Now on the other hand, the steak and potatoes were delicious! Cooked really well, seasoned deliciously and made my taste buds dance! I think next time Ill have a plate of that myself or try something else on the menu. A little pricey for hit and miss food."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! I love the open atmosphere it creates with long large tables, large chairs and open windows and doors to the patio area. The chandeliers hanging in the main dining area add just that bit of \"fancy\" the place needs, perfect touch. I really enjoy the patio seating this time of year, even though you are sat close together to other groups for some reason you still get a privacy vibe. I don't know if it's the way the tables are set up, or the company I was with! They have a small stage inside that they have live music played some nights, but I don't really enjoy it for I feel its a little too much for the restaurant.

The food is delicious! We decided to get the onion dip and chips for an appetizer, something really easy that you can eat at home right? Well Culinary makes a great dip! We couldn't stop ourselves, trying to remember that our main courses were coming! I had the rainbow trout! I NEVER eat fish so when I am randomly craving it, this place is where I come. It's smothered in almonds and this delicious creamy sauce...... HANDS OFF I don't share this dish. My boyfriend decided to ordered the fried chicken (which you have to wait a little extra time for) and it was definitely worth the wait. The chicken was moist and tender and the sides of mashed potatoes and coleslaw were like eating at grandma's house.

I am very impressed with the staff here. On a Wednesday night, it was pretty packed, for 2 we had to wait about 30 minutes but the staff is very courteous by grabbing your cell number and texting you when your table is ready. The bar had a few open seats, so we were able to have a drink before dinner. I like that there are no uniforms here, each of the staff members are able to show off their individuality and personality with the way they dress, which I feel makes them more comfortable and friendly. Its really hipster, the staff is very friendly and laid back! If you're not paying attention it does make it a little hard to find your waitress or waiter, but you should be so kind to pay attention to the people taking care of you for the evening.

Certainly a great place to put on your list. Great location, great atmosphere, great staff and delicious food! Keep it up Culinary!!"}
{"text":"I visited this place because I received a gift card from my parents for Fox Restaurants, and I've heard quite a few people recommend this place. We visited today around 2:30pm (definitely not prime time, so it was pretty dead) My husband got the fish and chips, I got the Pub Burger (with Havarti cheese and bacon) It normally comes with mayo and BBQ sauce, I got the BBQ on the side. I ordered the burger medium and it was so juicy and tender, the meat was just crumbling so easily (I can't complain!) We split the Chocolate Toffee Tart Pie...Yum!! Overall, we enjoyed the place. I have a deep appreciation for interior design, and I love how the place is put together."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for my first visit to the Phoenix area. Had the Rose, selected meat and cheeses and fish and chips along with banana pie. Service was great - staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Went with another couple on a weeknight... no wait, good service.  The Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue is to die for.  We also ordered the Pork Belly Cubano, it was just eh, but the Kurobuta Pork Ribs were awsome!!!  They have a great beer/wine menu.  Would recommend this place more for drinks and apps. but will definately head back."}
{"text":"Worth the trip for the Capn' Crunch French Toast alone!
A local friend recommended this place for breakfast and it was a great decision!  It's not too over the top expensive and the Capn' Cruch French toast is a meal I would go back again for.  We went on a Sunday (didn't open until 10am...a little late for Vegas) and watched some football while we ate.  There were plenty of tvs, a nice cross between bar and restaurant."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and fun bar. We have had several outings there and its always fun."}
{"text":"What can I say...excellent is excellent.   Food is outstanding and service...OMG...best service ever.   We were a wedding parry of ten and our server was attentive and outstanding in every sense of the word.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place in my neighborhood..been going since they first opened.  Highly recommend the steak, meatloaf, and various weekend brunch items.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Culinary is a dope spot! Food is great! Space is cool. Please put one right next to my house please. Stay away from the fries. Theyre too delicious."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of coming to this venue for a company anniversary party over the weekend. We were in a private room and was set away from the crowds of the Halloween weekend. I remember peeking through when this was a blank space, but it was set up nicely for the company function. The night started off with a little happy hour. It was great that there was a private bar within this space and there were 2 bartenders taking care of the party. There was probably 150-175 attendees and the bartenders were on top of their game. Throughout the night, I didn't have to wait long to refresh my drink. When we sat down at our tables, there was a short speech about how far the company has come. I sat at one of the very last tables and although they had speakers set up throughout the floor, it was hard to hear. I'm not sure if it was the speakers or the space of the room? Anyways, our dinner was set up buffet style. There was one long table set up with all the food options and we were able to get through from both sides. My dinner plate consisted of the chopped salad (so yummy that I went up for an extra plate after I finished my dinner), kale salad, 36 hour pork ribs (pretty tender), fried chicken (crispy with a little sweetness), mashed potatoes & gravy (salty), green beans and pumpkin cheesecake (I don't like cheesecake much but I ate the whole piece). For a buffet, I thought dinner was pretty good. Food was plentiful and even after everyone went through the line, the food items were re-filled. We finished the night outside in the private courtyard and played a game of cornhole. This was a nice venue for a smaller, intimate group with great amenities!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets. I had some friends from visit from the East Coast and they were blown away just by the size of this place. Nowhere on the East Coast can you find a place this spacious and with so much to do! They have fire pit surrounding booths, corn hole, and a selfie station. The food is very basic American (I would love something more flavorful) but amazing considering most people come here just for the bar, and the food is an extra perk. Amazing for groups, and totally beats Scottsdale's busy and chaotic nightlife scene. This place is a must for visitors looking to relax."}
{"text":"The chicken probably would have been good if it didn't taste like fish. Time to change the oil?  The crisps and onion dip were quite good, so the experience wasn't a total bust, but for the prices they are charging, I expected my chicken to taste like chicken."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and father-in-law stopped in on a Sunday afternoon to enjoy an early dinner. The first impression was it smelled like a locker room and we kept wondering why it smelled so bad. We had never been there so decided to stay and see what it was all about. Our waitress was very nice, friendly and prompt. My father-in-law and I both ordered the fried chicken, my daughter got the fish and chips and my husband ordered the ribs. My daughter's plate arrived with a hair in the fish - no it wasn't hers ( her hair was pulled back in a pony tail). The chicken was very dark - cooked way too long and tasted burnt. It was very dry. We did not return it because we figured if they served it looking like that they obviously think nothing is wrong. VERY DISAPPOINTING !! The atmosphere was dark (black and purple) and seemed like a strip joint feel. All the waitresses wear short cut offs and look sloppy. The ones with long hair do not have it pulled back (wonder where the hair in the fish came from???????) No recommendations here except for the nice waitress we had to get a job somewhere else!!  God help you if you eat here -stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about CD, and while I'm not familiar with the Fox concept restaurants, I was excited to try this place out tonight with some of my guy friends. We rolled in at around 9:30p and were quickly greeted and sat down. The place, located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, is pretty \"swanky\" and really spacious. A great place for large groups I'd say. We got a table in front of the kitchen and had some waters to start. 

After looking over the daunting menu for a couple minutes, we decided on what to go. We started off with the homemade potato chips and pretzel fondue to start, both of which were really good. I'm partial to pretzels so I liked that a little better, but the chips were also good with the dip. I had the something punch to drink which was really good, love the mixing of the fruit juices. I had the turkey pastrami sandwich which comes on a pretzel roll which, from what I ate, was delicious. I just had my wisdom teeth removed and can only tolerate so much chewing, so unfortunately I couldn't finish but I have my leftovers in the fridge! Anyways, everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals, and we finished it all off with the apple monkey bread which was also very good. 

It's the kind of place that isn't really pricy but it adds up (between the four of us our bill was $100+, but that was also with apps and drinks, so it's really worth it. Plus the food is really good. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous food. Parking is free in the garage next door. We had appetizer pretzel fondue. It was amazing! Mini soft pretzels with a melted cheese for dipping. Yum. Entrees included fried chicken, ahi tuna salad, and turkey pastrami, on yet another pretzel bun. Everything was fabulous! Staff were attentive and helpful with menu selections. We will come again for sure.  One other note...there was a live band tonite too."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night. It was crowded but we managed to score a spot at the bar.  Music was great mix of old school hip hop with newer dance stuff. Our waitress was extremely patient with our somewhat unorganized group of 7. The food was amazing! Our group ordered the fried chicken, pierogies, nachos, wings, pretzel bread and cheese. Everything was super tasty and hit the spot.  Our cocktails were also delicious... one star came off due to waiting on drinks. Not sure where the hold up was but probably could have squeezed another round if not two more rounds of pricey cocktails out of our group if drink service was faster ."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! I heard a lot about this place from friends and decided that I had to try it. I had the Butternut Squash Cannelloni with mushrooms and brussel sprouts on top of it. It was the best I ever had! At first, I thought it was a small portion, however it filled me up fast and was so fresh and tasty!

I also had a Double Chocolate Stout and a beer from Kona, Hawaii. Both were great and the chocolate beer had a great chocolate aftertaste. My boyfriend had the Fried Chicken and it was glazed with a delicious and sweet honey spread and was a very large meal! He had two local beers that he enjoyed. The waiter was very friendly and made great recommendations. He was fantastic! 

There was also live, entertaining music. Great for a Friday night!

For dessert we shared the Apple Monkey Bread (which is cooked fresh) and served with ice cream. It was delicious! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Heard great things about this trendy place. I took friends that came in to Phoenix for just the day, and it being my first time too, we were all impressed.

It's got a great vibe and the happy hour specials made our bill so much cheaper than I thought it was going to be. 
I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for all ages. Food is priced well and also has good drinks. I got the hummus to start and the burger as my meal. The hummus was very good and the burger was just alright. It was a double  but the patties were so small and thin all I could taste was the three pieces of bread it had. The homemade ranch was tasty and went well with the fries. My friend got the muscles and liked them and my wife wasn't all that happy with her salad. 

 I would eat there again but would get something else for the main meals. Also service was a little slow but the restaurant  was packed."}
{"text":"Second time in two weeks eating here was at a different location this time but had the same quality food. I feel people come more for the atmosphere then the food. Everything I've tried at this resturant was par at best."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and wonderful service! We went on a Thursday afternoon for happy hour and it exceeded our expectations.
We had the pretzel balls with fondue (a must have), mini grilled cheese (these were just ok. Once dipped in the fondue, it changed everything!) and the pastrami on a soft pretzel bun. The sandwich was good, but for some reason it seemed like it was turkey pastrami. I may have read the menu wrong, but I was expecting real pastrami. Either way, it was wonderful and I'm ready to go back!"}
{"text":"Ashlii was our server and she was so attentive and nice. The chicken meatballs are delicious !!!"}
{"text":"What a bummer.

Culinary Dropout was one of the restaurants I was most excited about for our trip to Vegas.  The pictures and reviews made this place sound amazing.  
Unfortunately, we had a disappointing visit.  First of all, a large group had reserved space near the patio and the patio itself was full, so we were stuck in the front of the restaurant which feels completely removed from the fun.  Next, our server was a victim of a surprise rush and was completely overwhelmed, causing slow service, mistakes in our orders, and constantly being reminded how \"crazy it is in here tonight\".
The food itself fell short too.  My wife and I ordered salads that didn't actually get served with the ingredients listed on the menu.  Her Caesar salad was supposed to include kale and my salad was supposed to include avocado (neither made it our our dishes).  One of the most anticipated parts of the meal was the pretzel/provolone app - unfortunately, the pretzels were overdone.

Big time bummer because I think if outside seating would've been available and the place was properly staffed, we could've overlooked the food shortcomings and had a good time."}
{"text":"Went here for a rare date night with my husband.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  This was our first time there and I was amazed at how loud it was inside at 4:30 in the afternoon.  When our waitress finally arrived, I asked for lots of water.  It's damned hot out in the summer!  I explained to her that I would like LOTS of water.  
Fast forward to the food... it was average.  We had the pretzel bites for an appetizer. Not horrible, but not spectacular.  He ordered the fried chicken, and I had the fish and chips.  His complaint was the chicken was over cooked and too crispy for him.  I thought it was cooked fine, but really lacked flavor.  The fish though, that was pretty tasty.  It was a lot of food.  Too bad I spent most of my meal with an empty glass that should have had water in it.  LOTS of water.
I had to ask the hostess for a refill as well as the food runner.  My waitress was very visible on the floor, but could not seem to be bothered by checking in on such a lowly two-top.  Will we go back? Probably not.  This place did not rank on my list of \"must have again\". And thanks for the migraine due to dehydration... That makes the visit even better!"}
{"text":"Their BBQ pork nachos are amazing.  I also like their pretzels, fish and chips, and fried chicken.  Everything is good there."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. The fish was flaky and fried perfect. Pretzle bites with cheese are gigantic and fabulous. Can't wait to go again and try tge fried chicken!!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I've been to in a long while. And I've honestly been impressed with few places since moving to Scottsdale.

Service took forever. While the salad was decent once I got enough dressing to know their was any on there, the main course was dreadful. Of the 4 of us, 3 sent back our food and the 4th found hers unappealing (and should have sent hers back).

I asked the waitress if English customers like the fish and chips. As I'm from that side of the pond myself, I am fussy about that. I was assured their English patrons love it, so that's what I ordered.

Well, they brought out 2 orders by mistake. The second one was delivered just as I bit into my first piece of fish. That was hard enough to hurt my teeth, it was so over-fried. The chips, by contrast, were soggy. So I swapped it for the second order, which was exactly the same.

In my almost 2 hours there before I went off to get some food elsewhere, the manager did not appear. Really should have, considering our experience. Apparently, after the men left, the manager did make an appearance, and not charge for the food. Not enough to change my opinion of the place.

Go here if your primary reason for going out is to drink. Maybe get the trout, which I'm assured is good. Otherwise, stay clear - at least on a Friday (and probably Saturday)."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise to find amazing food at Culinary Dropout. A varied menu and lots of options. The Gorgonzola chicken salad is amazing as is the beet starter. Fun place to bring your family."}
{"text":"This a nice trendy happy hour spot. The food is delicious too. I have tried a couple of things here that I recommend. Top of the list is the Italian Grinder followed by the fried chicken and Mac burger. This place is great to meet up with friends or fun date nights. 

As mentioned before parking is a pain. I have never been here when I could just park myself. Valet is available so bring your tip cash with you."}
{"text":"What's not to love!!! This place is a great place whether to just hang it with friends or come in on a date.  

I've been here twice and both times have throughly enjoyed my experience.  I'd suggest making a reservation ahead whether calling it in or using Open Table. So much easier once you arrive.  

Service has been excellent both times and the quality of food delicious. Great ambiance all around.  Great HH options and the pretzels and cheese fondue were freaking dynamite!!! Do yourself a favor and get them!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome concept! They have tons of yard game and a fun bar scene. It used to be a motorcycle dealership and they should win an award for best redesign and reuse of a building in Phoenix. It's totally a great place to meet with friends and just drink and hang out. The food is alright, but more diversified than the Scottsdale location. My only gripe is you cannot go on the weekend nights without a reservation (have to call a week ahead and have a large party) but that's what happens when you open a successful new place. Also, ask for Austen, great server!!!"}
{"text":"After a night at Piranha the hubby my self and two new friends when here for dinner. 1st remember it's in side the hard rock, we were seated in the most beautiful dinning hall, were there was just fantastic live music and u could. See them work there magic in the kitchen. After being seated we had the most amazing and handsome waiter name Matt..I mean wow, Matt took such good care of us. He made sure to give us the best advice on the food, drinks everything. He check on us and always mad sure to make us feel we were the center of this dinning experience. The fried chicken is amazing I mean sooooo good. It does take a little longer so make sure to get the order in, we had the Thai chili  wings for an appetizer there fabulous but spicy and the home made chips... two of us had the Ruben's and loved them. All and all this is a place that deserves 10 stars... BTW  yes Matt was a amazing the rest of the people where sooo sweet and nice as well, it's just Matt help make our night."}
{"text":"No complaints with service, but food items seem to SOUND much tastier than they are. The most recent food entree that encouraged me to actually write my review is a salad. How do you mess up a salad? I ordered a chopped salad (I dont remember the exact name of the salad) that was suppose to have like 3 different meats in it. Whatever meat was in the salad was diced up close the size of a sea salt grain. It was so tiny that I tasted no meat, and was still hungry after. This is about the third time in the past year I have gone and been less than satisfied with my meal. I think I'll pass next time"}
{"text":"Here for a weekday HH on a out of town project with coworkers. The place was large and not very packed for a Wednesday night. The lounge layout was not very accommodating for larger groups over 10 since the couch are fixed to the floor but the staff did offer chairs around the table on the other side.  The food and drinks were good.  The ribs I got was a full rack and a good value for the money.  The salmon and ravioli looked good too."}
{"text":"Cons:
Pricey drinks and food
Wifi constantly crashes
No paper towels in bathroom - just unsanitary Dyson blade hand dryers (and a door you have to pull open)
VERY Small portions (fries that come with burgers/chips from snack menu/cheap house salad)
Poor TV layout - more needed everywhere esp in The Coop
Servers at bar are slow/self absorbed.
Not good for kids



Pros: Great huge patio/misters/bar games (ping pong/bags)
Lots of cool seating options (booths with fire tables that you can reserve)
Great for groups/events
Great bathroom decor"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Leaves so much money on the table it's Crazy!

Cons:

1. NO WIFI?!!!!! For the prices they're charging this is inexcusable. Server said they were told it was because it may \"overload the staff/management wifi,\" and that a lot of employees \"use laptops around the restaurant.\"  LOL.

2. Valet parking only. Street parking mostly limited to residents.

3.  EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE FOOD AND DRINKS.

4.  Small TVs, most of which have a glare.

5.  Poor bar service. Bartenders talk amongst themselves rather than serve the very few customers at the bar.

No wonder this place is mostly empty."}
{"text":"Great food but poor service. It took them 20 min to seat us, even with a reservation. The hostess was clueless. Service continued to be slow throughout dinner. It took about 15 min to get a drink."}
{"text":"I had the trout and it was cooked superbly.  My colleague had the salmon and it looked great with the barley cooked like oatmeal underneath.  Beers were great.  Cool place with a great vibe.  Food is not overpriced.  All was great."}
{"text":"Arrived a little after our reservation time to realize two things. First, self parking preferred because it's only 6pm on Saturday night and valet already full. Secondly, didn't need the reservation! We're 1 of 6 parties in the whole place. :P

[[ Drinks ]]-- \"Room Service\" cocktail = gin, strawberry, lemon juice, and champagne. Not bad... Pretty yum with a sparkling sweetness!

[[ Pork Belly Toast ]]-- recommended by the server and it tasted surprisingly asian. Pork belly wasn't super crisp but rather fatty and thick. Served on a single baguette slice, cut in 3. The sauce was sweet and tangy with maybe bit of soy sauce? Delish!

[[ Shaved Prime Rib Dip ]]-- mmmm!! Super soft bread with a very FULL serving of tender (not dry!) shaved prime rib. It made the sandwich super easy to eat but also fed the appetite all night. I suggest getting the coleslaw with it.

[[ Grilled Cheese Sliders ]]-- How adorbs are these tiny sliced bread as my sliders! Haha comes with 3 sliders. Cheesey cheese and bacony bacon! There's a slice of tomato in each but it didn't do anything for me. 

Ambiance was casual cool and I appreciated that it was not the bit pretentious. Server was super friendly and attentive and made all the right recommendations. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was a bit disappointed in several areas... I had heard of this restaurant from friends and read previous Yelp reviews, so I was anxious to give this place a try. I felt the staff was cold and impersonal...seeming harried, rushed, and inconvenienced. The food was ok and overpriced for what was offered. The atmosphere at first seemed wonderful, but soon felt chaotic and stressful. I felt rushed and was happy to finish my overpriced and underwhelming food and leave. I will probably not return based on my experience."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best places to eat inside the Hard Rock Casino. The pretzel bites with the cheese fondue are delicious and a must have. They have a decent happy hour with $6 appetizers and $3 beers. Regular prices are average strip prices, with specialty cocktails running around $12. They have a very unique cocktail menu and the ones I've tried are really good. You should eat here if you are staying at the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Had my birthday lunch here Yummy food. Manager did a great job when my birthday dessert burned in the oven. She gave me a different one to go and cut the check in half. I was very satisfied. My trout was yummy and cooked perfectly. My mom had the pork ribs and I tried them and were good also. Glad I picked lunch here and will come back!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a Fox concept. Sam Fox is literally THE best. Please open more restaurants in Vegas! The pretzels with fondue are literally to die for. The homemade potato chips with dip are fabulous. These are two things we always order here even before getting to the main courses!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Big enough that it's not over crowded, and lots of activities. I love the theme and the food is good too!  I'd like to see one in the San Tan area."}
{"text":"This place is in a place called \"the yard\".  I think it's one of two or more restaurants in the yard.

The indoor part of the restaurant has high and low seating - mostly high tables.

The 16oz beers (they call them pints) are more like 10 or 12 ounce.

We ate outside in \"the yard\".  They have more comfortable seating, if you like the elements.  They have yard games like lawn darts and corn hole (or whatever that thing is called).

I enjoyed the Ramen noodles.  The menu is very limited items, but I think it'll satisfy almost any palate.  Also has the Pretzels - they were good."}
{"text":"I like Culinary. I am fond of the space and the patio (The Yard) is beautiful. You can't go wrong with ping pong and corn hole although I didn't have time to play on my last visit. The service is usually pretty superior too. 

I came for lunch the other day and I think we were the first to arrive. The chopped salad that I ordered was delicious, it had salami, provolone, turkey pastrami, ham, pickled vegetables and large couscous. It was so big I couldn't finish it. 

The only drawbacks are the prices which are a tad steep, and that they don't have any wine specials during happy hour. Either way I know I will be back, this is a great addition to Tempe and I am sure the college kids will have a blast playing games if they can afford the beer."}
{"text":"We are here on vacation and were excited to try this restaurant. Our group of six made a reservation and still waited ten-fifteen minutes to be seated. We then waited over a half hour for our drinks and an HOUR AND A HALF for our food. The counter for food pick up by wait staff, which was completely by all customers, was completely covered in dirty plates. The entire staff was pacing through the place looking stressed and angry. The bathroom was dirty and had no toilet paper. At one point a waitress was walking through the dining area carrying a bottle of bleach. When we finally received our food there was absolutely no apology  for the wait time. Two out of our six plates were served cold. There was no acknowledgment of poor service, no explanation for delays, the manager was present and walking the floor but never came over to discount the check or apologize. 


I 100% do not recommend."}
{"text":"I am docking a star for not having one wine on the happy hour menu! What is up with that!"}
{"text":"I had the grilled cheese sliders and to be honest they tasted just like the ones I make at home for a fraction of the price. It was over priced, My dinner companions thought the same thing. The apps were not a  hit. The fried chicken was good but my friend did not like like the cole slaw. My daughter liked the pretzel fondue but it came cold and the waitress didnt light the candle until after it came to the table so it never warmed up.
 It was all just very ordinary. The atmosphere was great. Parking is horrible and you have to use the valet service. Waitstaff was efficient. All in all we decided that we would not go back because there was nothing special about the food for the prices that we paid.  You may love it but we didnt. Cool name though, right ?"}
{"text":"CD is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere and definitely in AZ.  Every time i visit my family in AZ, I drag everyone to the Scottsdale location. BUT, this time, we went to the new PHX location located at the Yard.  The Yard has an AMAZING outdoor area w large firepits and plenty of chairs that makes the wait not too bad.  I was lucky to grab a reservation just before we rolled up and still had to wait a tiny bit.

Ordered the pretzel fondue.  Smoked fish salad. and the black bottom bourbon pie.  I forget what the rest of the table ordered, but I think my choices were the best.  Can't wait for another visit to AZ so I can go to CD at The Yard!"}
{"text":"I am in love, love, love with Fox Restaurants. Never been disappointed with anything I've had. The atmosphere was fun and engaging. We got the pretzels for an appetizer and they were soft and fluffy little pillows that I absolutely adored. And I might have drank the cheese sauce it was so good. I got the kale salad and every bite was delicious. My husband also really liked his Italian sandwich, although it wouldn't have been my first choice. They were out of the beer I wanted, so I ordered another; and it was fine. Just a little annoying when they run out of their special beers on tap. But still, I had a great time."}
{"text":"This is such a fun place! My family loves the pretzels and cheese, the best melted cheese we've had in the valley! Delicious pretzel buns too, bring on the carbs! ;)

Culinary Dropout has a rad outdoor patio with cornhole and ping pong, plus a private room in the back for events. They also have another private space for events near the kitchen/bathrooms, looks rad!

Yummy drinks and love music on the weekends. A must for locals!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Culinary Dropout last night for drinks and the live music. At about 9pm on a Saturday night there was a 30 min wait, so we skipped that and sat at the bar. Roberto was a fantastic bartender, attentive and remembered everyone's names. He joked with everyone and created a great atmosphere. 

I ordered a Moscow Mule, it was strong and delicious. My friend and I also ordered the nachos and soft pretzels and shared them. They're always yummy! 

One of my fav local places."}
{"text":"I loved sitting on the fabric chairs! Such a relaxing laid back feel! I was able to watch a lil sports from afar by the bar. We enjoyed some pretzel fondue. They were more like pretzel rolls that you take apart by pieces and dip into a melting pot of cheese. Then I ordered the grilled cheese with ham and a side of fries. If you're about simplicity and comfort food...park it here. I also tried some fried chicken and meatloaf. After all that...I felt a lil regret."}
{"text":"Amazing fried chicken & biscuits. $18 Friendly service. Young crowd. Industrial  feel. Loud music."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great, lively, fun decor, open spaces. Drinks were also really good, I had a mule and also a champagne cocktail- both were tasty and went down a little too easy. I'm taking a star off due to my French dip. It looked nowhere as good as the pics I saw on yelp. Meat was dry, barely any cheese....and now they don't serve it with horseradish cream, you have to ask for it. That was the only thing that saved it. For $17, I was really disappointed but Chips and French onion dip were good. I'd give it another shot, maybe it was just a fluke....everyone else seemed to enjoy their food."}
{"text":"This place was very happening when we went!  The beer/wine selection was good!!
My husband ordered the fried chicken and he loved it and so did I!!!
I had the Mac burger!  It was good, but a little dry for me. 
The server was on point!  
And the ranch dressing was the BEST ranch dressing I have ever had!  
Would return!"}
{"text":"We came here on a late Thursday night after a concert at the Marquee.
This place is a wide open space with high ceilings, didn't look at the decor too much because I was tired, hungry and really wanted to go home. 
Out server was nice, but he was way too \"attentive\", this was our first time there and while having a server explain the menu is what most people prefer, my friend and I just want to be given time to read it ourselves. He kept stopping by which made it harder to concentrate and it became somewhat annoying. Maybe he was new or we were his last table and he wanted to get our order in quickly.
Once we ordered he pretty much left us alone and we enjoyed our time there. 
We shared the grilled cheese sliders and the seared tuna salad. The sliders look more impressive than they taste and we only ate one each. The salad was something else! It is probably one of the most delicious salads I have ever had. Just typing this makes me want to drive down there and have one for dinner. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Every time we come here, I wonder why we aren't more regular visitors (Oh yeah, living in the UPUPUP N. valley will do that to you.) The Waterfront is one of my favorite areas of town to walk around, and fueling up beforehand with dinner at Culinary Dropout is always a good idea!

Another thought I always have here is, \"why do we even bother with eating anywhere that's not a Fox RC?\" I've lived here for over 6 years (gasp) and I'm always astounded at the bad customer service that goes on in restaurants and bars here. We've NEVER had a bad moment at a Fox place, and for that, they've earned our loyalty. 

Culinary Dropout is always crowded, and always loud. It can make conversation a little hard, but those damn pretzel bites with provolone fondue are worth it. You get like...40382 little pretzel bites, and that's only a slight exaggeration. 

Everything we've tried on the menu is delicious. Our most recent trip included the fried chicken/biscuit/mashed potato plate for my husband (honey-drizzle, people) and a delicious sweet corn ravioli made with smoked shallots for me. Those smoked shallots. I now dream of them. Drinks are always good as well, and by \"drinks\" I mean they pour bubbly and keep it coming for me. Sold!

Short and sweet: Always a solid choice!"}
{"text":"So I came here for my birthday. The place is awesome the ambiance is great. The food is phenomenal. We had an issue with the food the manager quickly came out to apologize and brought us out a whole new order. They even sent me a birthday cake. I would definitely recommend this place for drinks or dinner."}
{"text":"Huge place!  Ordered a burger Medium Rare and I am not sure if the lady thought I said Medium Well or what, because that is how it came out.  I was with a 7-8 work associates, so I decided not to complain.  The Onion Rings were super tasty, as were the french fries.  I will be back in Phoenix in April and will probably come back and try again.  Will update my review if/when that happens"}
{"text":"Ok I will admit it.. dining at the Hard Rock (well, except Nobu) isnt that fantastic. It just doesnt compare to many of the other hotels. I randomly walked into Culinary Dropout looking for some place to have a drink and grab a quick bite. Man! I am so glad I did!

First off the atmosphere is really laid back but still very trendy. I liked that. They had sports on everywhere, friendly staff, and the patrons all seemed to be having a good time. I sat at the bar and looked through thier drink menu.. lots of impressive craft cocktails. I had the spicy tequila one (I forget the name) and it was the best drink I had in Vegas! The bartenders were so nice and super helpful. I had the buffalo chicken meatballs (they were sooo yummy) and the brussel sprout small plate- also yummy. This place is seriously a find! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Really cool place.  It's a giant building with 3 restaurants under one roof and a very backyard feel.  Originally my boss and I came for Little Cleo's but ended up being seated here.  The food was reasonably priced, yet surprisingly prepared and presented like a Michelin restaurant.  The mussels are absolutely amazing and is a must!  The bistro steak was delicious as well, although the portion was small and did not seem like an 8 oz. steak.  Atmosphere is great, would recommend to come here to have a good meal with easy going company."}
{"text":"I'm only going to mention the pretzel fondue... Love the conception, love the pretzel but it's WAY over-priced! 
The outdoor seating was nice but the wind kept blowing out the candle for the fondue. :("}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service Trever was our waiter. Awesome waiter!!! Please give him a raise. Very professional !!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Korean Rib eye was out of this world good. The service was amazing, nice and attentive."}
{"text":"What a great place.The service from our server was incredible and there food was equally great. If you're at the Hard Rock make sure you don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Overall, a pretty good restaurant with a cool atmosphere and decent food. I had a good time here but waiting about 1 hour for a table.  

baby back rib entre was very good!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, bar, chill spot. The food and drinks were very good (prime rib with fontina and au jus with a seasonal saison draft). Our group of 9 was quickly seated and served. After dinner, we hit up the ping pong tables and cornhole. Most other places would charge for this, but culinary drop out does it right and provides this complimentary."}
{"text":"Our first meal in Las Vegas was absolutely awesome.

We sat outside by the pool in front of one of the fires with a beautiful view. There was a live band playing some fun covers for entertainment so the atmosphere here is great.

We ordered the pretzels and fondue, a selection of meats, the smoked salmon spread, and the pork belly toast. All of it was fantastic and I have no complaints.

Great food, service, and environment. I loved it here and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We came before the Raiding the Rock Vault show for my wife's birthday. The food exceeded our expectations and we will recommend the restaurant to friends. We have been to Las Vegas over 20 times and Culinary Dropout will bring us back to the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Oh my Yum!  Pork Belly nachos after lying by the pool all day - so amazing. I really think best nachos I've ever had. Hubby had grilled cheese sliders - nothing special. Service/staff good.  Great view of pool activities. They have an amazing happy hour menu.  My nachos were only $6."}
{"text":"Pretty space, great outdoor  seating, bad service, and so-so food. Our waitress was apathetic at best, let's leave it at that. 

The best thing on the menu is the $2 crusty bread and good olive oil. It's to die for. Almost Tartine (SF) status. I love the antipasti set up - you can order a series of small bites to share while waiting on your main courses, and they'll serve them all up on one platter with side plates. We ordered the aforementioned bread, some Humboldt Fog (oh so good), beets, olives, and asparagus, and everything was delicious.

Then things started going downhill. The Italian chopped salad is seriously weak - the ingredients aren't actually chopped, it's surprisingly gloopy from the preserved bell peppers and artichoke hearts they had added in, and despite the multitude of ingredients, it didn't really taste like anything. The ricotta gnocchi had an overpowering amount of sausage, and there were more mushroom bits than gnocchi.  The trout was alright, nothing impressive. The fish and chips looked really good, but again, kind of flavorless. The only thing really up to snuff was the Pub Burger, which I would definitely recommend. 

This place is probably cool on a Saturday night, but I would just recommend ordering carefully and finding a waitress who is knowledgable about and can advise you on the menu."}
{"text":"The atmosphere & food are amazing!  We tried the beef stroganoff and the chicken. The first was preferred. The pretzel fondue is unreal good!  And, the cheap salad was very tasty. The bartender even created a special drink for one who had a taste for something not on the menu. Be sure to try this place!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8 during at late night of gambling and was seated immediately. I had the rack of ribs and it was sooo tender and yuummmms. The flavor was perfect and the meat fell right off the bone. I just wish there was more meat on there for me to devour lol. I shared half of the ribs with my friend. It comes with a side of fries and coleslaw.

 
The Asian in me wish there was side of rice to soak up the rib sauce. lol Highly recommend if you want to lick your fingers and get your hands dirtyyyyy. Service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout at The Yard is quite a place.  Great planning obviously went into this concept and it works.

Happy hour drinks are a good deal, and they have a solid tap selection.

In terms of food, the pork belly BBQ nachos were awesome-great homemade chips, pork, sauces (including a great queso) make this something to share...or not.  I had the M.A.C. burger, their version of a certain famous burger at a large chain, and it really shows the difference in quality of meat and imaginative sauce-making.   Chips and onion dip were a great side.   

Atmosphere is a mix between a craft brewery/gastropub/local joint, so it doesn't feel like a chain but has their act together.   When I'm in town next, I'll go again for sure."}
{"text":"This seems to be the trendy hotspot of the moment. While I enjoyed me food and drinks very much, I just wasn't a fan of the hipster atmosphere.  That being said, it was very frustrating trying to separate the staff from the customers because they wear their everyday clothing. I also didn't care for my server having his shirt halfway unbuttoned with his chest hair exposed; I don't think they make a hairnet for that. Besides that, the staff was friendly and like I said prior, the food and drinks were good. However, the only reason I'd go back there would be if my friends wanted to go."}
{"text":"Over priced dry food. Over priced weak drinks not made correctly and servers who give you atritude . no thanks"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday and waited an hour for a table...long wait but fun drink options at the bar.  I had the pisco painkiller (reminiscing pisco from my trip to peru) and it was really good! Plan on most drinks being $8-10. I also had the Brazilianaire which had pomegranate foam that was really tasty.
 There was live music inside, which was good but too loud to have table talk. Prices are reasonable for the food (appetizers $2-7 and dinners $10-20). The fettuccine was good but not amazing. They had really beautiful massive chandeliers and neat decor. The bathroom fixtures are worth checking out too :P"}
{"text":"Service was awful. We ordered drinks and appetizers right way and it took 40 min to receive both. Not once did the waitress come over to let us know. We ended up going to the bar to order a drink. Our food also took at least 45 min to come out at which point out appetizers came out minutes before. Asked bus girl a question and she responded with \"I'm not your waitress\".  Our waitress never acknowledged or kept us informed on what was taking so long. In fact, she could never be found. Has to down my drink on my way out and asked the bartender if I could leave my empty glass there and she huffed yeah and rolled her eyes at me. I was being courteous to these people the whole time! On a positive, the atmosphere and ambiance was cool, good live music, good food, and the manager ended up compensating our appetizers plus giving a discount on our total bill for the all the problems we had."}
{"text":"Absolutely WOW. We came to check this place out after a friend's recommendation. With the name like \"Dropouts\" in title - someone may be skeptic, however, the food and service and people working here - everything was simply amazing. Kevin - you are simply the cutest"}
{"text":"Excellent food we had the pretzel fondue appetizer, main dishes gnocchi, the pasta dish with rib meat and tomato sauce, and the burger. Yes there were three of us and we did not leave hungry. We ate almost every bite. The service was very friendly and attentive (not overly attentive). We sat on the patio in the last week of March and enjoyed our dining experience (not loud at all).  My husband is a private chef and dined along with another great friend of mine who is the General Manager at 5th and Wine a few blocks away. My friend has dined here several times and we are all foodies who did not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"The only reason I have been back here twice is because of The Yard. I think it's a really great concept, however, the service and quality at the Culinary Dropout don't justify the prices to me. If there was a cheaper place at The Yard to get drinks, I would go there instead and go more often. They bragged about their Bloody Mary Mix but it tasted like tomato sauce to me. To be clear, I have not tried their food, but after reviewing the menu, nothing really jumped out at me. Maybe the hype over Fox's restaurants had me expecting more."}
{"text":"Frankly, one of the best Manhattan's I've had anywhere (and I'm from Chicago) -- great vermouth and great cherries.  Food is good too, and bartenders and good."}
{"text":"I had come here on recommendation by hotel staff and from looking around on Yelp, and I definitely was NOT disappointed, I LOVED IT! This is definitely a gastropub worth going to if you're looking for a new take on American favorites, good quality food and drinks, and really cheap prices! The staff are very knowledgeable and accommodating, and the service is great. I would recommend that if you plan on coming on a game night or a weekend, make a reservation so that you're assured a table. The wait if you don't have can be quite long, but luckily we had made a reservation."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Love the bacon parmsean Grissini and the Bourbon black bottom pie!!!!"}
{"text":"Fire pits alit, sitting outside in the nice 75 degree crystal clear desert evening, with a good friend and some great food was my welcoming to Vegas. 

We just happened to drop in to Culinary Dropout. They had plenty of space around 7pm on a Thursday, but as we were leaving a couple hours later, the bar and tables were all starting to get rowdy and full.

Our waitress was super friendly, sweet and impeccable with her timing. Which made for a smooth dining experience from start to finish.  

Maybe I don't get out enough or maybe just maybe my food sensors have become much more easier to please. But I would vote this salmon the best I've had within the year!! The apples and Brussels Sprouts that complimented the filet made for an explosion of flavor in my mouth. Whew... :: eyes were definitely rolling to the back of my head. 

I'm a huge fan, even if the guy was a dropout. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The hostess was not able to help when we asked where our party's reserved table was located ( probably because no one updated the iPad, she was completely incapable of problem solving) So we missed the surprise for our friends b day because not a single staff member was able or willing to assist us, they avoided eye contact, one server actually pretended not to see me, I was 2 feet from her . Service ultimately was slow but friendly. The pretzel app was very yummy and the dinner was good, sliders.  The place is too big for efficiency or they need to hire problem solvers. If you have time on your hands the food is good, loud and live music too. Only 2 stars for ruining the surprise party."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a review this bad but... Yikes!! Me and my friend got the kale salad w ahi. Our ahi was grey and very fishy smelling... Ahi shouldn't taste or smell fishy. We apologetically sent them back, as the fish was bad. My friend got salmon on hers and I got mine plain. Mind came with salmon (I hate it, even fishier). I felt too uncomfortable to say anything. I ate the few pieces of corn, couple nuts and 1 piece of avocado it was topped with. I paid for it because it was awkward. My friends liked their meat and cheese dishes, but I won't be back for food."}
{"text":"Alright, so I've been in to Culinary Dropout twice (at this location) and the first one was pretty good worthy of 4 starts. I came in the other day with my buddy and we sat at the bar and had good service, our questions were asked, nothing took too long to come out and we had people checking on us frequently to make sure we were alright. That was fine. The food is where we had trouble. Started off with the pretzels (my favorite appetizer there) and while the provolone was melted perfectly and the temperature was fine, I only found one pretzel that wasn't kinda stale and didn't taste super great. It seemed as if they had been cooked like a ballpark pretzel, which I was not a fan of. For entrees we had the Korean style ribeye cap and the Bistro steak, and I will never order either of those again and would not recommend them. The Korean style ribeye was ok, rather tasteless and had very little actual steak to the dish. Was not satisfactory as a meal. The Bistro steak was recommended to me and I was hungry and didn't finish it because I could not get past the overwhelming charred flavor. My steak was charred so much that it over powered everything about the steak and the rest of the dish and was completely unpleasant to taste. The rest of the dish was average if that, with the exception of the mushrooms that were cooked nearly perfectly, so cudos to the chef on saute that night. Because of my good experience in the past I am giving a rather favorable review. However, if just based on this experience there was nothing to bring me back except the drinks and kindness of the bartender."}
{"text":"Ok so I don't know how to review this place. For the most part I haven't been impressed with their food but I continue to go back because their pretzel balls are amazing! With that said I did like the fried chicken but haven't found anything else that is good and I've tried a lot of their dishes..."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Pretzels were delicious but their service was downright terrible (waited literally 20 minutes for someone to come over after being seated) & the main courses tasted like bar food at best."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Server was slow (she took breaks and ate during service) Enough said."}
{"text":"My husband and son took friends out here and said their food was great.  On this day when I came by here we left the stadium because ASU was losing and our relatives were having dinner here, so since we had not seen them yet and thought we'd have drinks watching the ASU/Cal Berkeley game, came on by. 

Boy was it an exciting 2nd half.  It started with a 3 point lead then a 10 point lead. That extra pic 6 sealed their fate for Victory. 

We had the best of both worlds. Experiencing the game at a sold out Stadium then going to this fun restaurant with televisions placed throughout the bar ( they could invest in a nice huge screen cause it was hard to see the score). 

Anyway, a Yay for dining and after dinner drinks at Culinary dropout."}
{"text":"My goodness, they have improved the pretzel!! I have been here three times now and I hope to head back soon. I do not head to the Hard Rock very often, but it appears plenty of other people do because this place is always busy. The location is right by the pool and has a nice stage. The patio is excellent and there is a bar outside. 

The food is out of this world. Leave your diet at home and try the Grilled Cheese Sliders!! YUM!"}
{"text":"Ok ok ok this place although is too hipster for me, it's good. Every thing we have ordered has been delicious. The breakfast sandwich??? Oh em gee... yeah I did that. It is by far the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had. Only request I have and it's a big request. PLEASE BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS on Sunday for brunch. If you guys make this happen. Brunching will become! Especially on football Sunday's."}
{"text":"My friend Krissy & I came to enjoy happy hour for her early birthday present 1 recent Friday. Live music, food, & drinks were all yum! & our server Jeremy was great! We had a such a fun night out! Thanks Culinary Dropout!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: After my last experience here, management offered me a meal on the house and knocked it out of the park. Alyssa  the manager who followed up with me on my last visit greeted us at the door and made sure everything was great. Lucas was our server, had great suggestions on specials and local brews for whatever we needed. Overall, it was great, I got to show some out of town friends how we do it out in Tempe. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Seen it. Get it. Average food. Service was ok. It has a ton of parking for downtown Tempe"}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night and waited about 40 minutes, which I didn't think was bad at all.  On the other hand, once we got our table we waited at least another 20 minutes before we were greeted by our server.  I had to finally call out to someone and ask them if we had a server.  Turns out they had a mix-up with the tables since they had a big party.  The manager immediately apologized and offered a round of drinks.  Once a server was assigned the service was good and the food was delicious.  At the end of the night the manager comped our entire meal... a big indicator to me that he didn't want a bad Yelp review :-)  

Overall, I would recommend Culinary Dropout to a friend."}
{"text":"I set out this evening looking for a stellar seafood meal.   Because plans don't always work out as you expected I wound up here.   Still having a hankering for seafood I leaned toward the fish and chips.   I ordered a local amber and kicked back.   Unfortunately, there was an issue with my order.    Timeliness apparently wasn't a factor.   One amber led to another.   Eventually the bartender realized it hadn't arrived and he lit a fire under the folks in the kitchen.   He was apologetic and took care of me.   When it did arrive the fish was lightly breaded, perfectly salted and delicious.  The chips were also nicely done and obviously recently cut.   All in all the meal turned out welll.    Props to these guys for their ability to roll with the punches and still keep all their customers happy."}
{"text":"Cocktails are well made. Food is good. Nice staff. Had the nachos. Very good. Only complaint was when informed they needed to substitute another steak for my ribeye only one dollar was taken off my bill and the substitute was not good. So.....I shall stick to the appetizers next time."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Went here with my mom and my older brother and they told us they couldn't seat us at a table because they reserve them for bigger parties, even though we called for a reservation. They said sorry but the bar was fine for us to sit at if we could find available seats. Also the whole place was so loud you had to yell just so someone could here you."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the fried chicken: 3 pieces, mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw, and a biscuit. Delicious! My friend had the grilled cheese sliders. Also quite good! 

I'd definitely make a return trip. Seemed less crowded than the other locations, but maybe that's because I visited on Sunday night. 

Minus a star because the service was a little spotty."}
{"text":"Let's start with the amazing service; my parents and I had every small request fulfilled with expedient service. For example, the table quickly went through all the bread that was paired with the well executed smoked salmon plate. The new aged hipster waiting on us quickly got a few more slices without billing us. Runny poached eggyolk combined with the tartness of the pickled onions making for a indulgent breakfast themed bite. This is not the \"lox\" styled salmon, rather a flaky, smokey, structurally sound piece of fish. That dipping sauce was something like a garlicky mayo, maybe a thicker bolder ranch.

The meaty and well marinaded ribs get a savory recommendation. These were some of the leanest ribs I have seen in a minute, perfect temp and melt off the bone.. Outback's quality kept declining, so I'm glad I found a new place to get my fix. The flavor balance leaned more towards sweet than jalapeno yet didn't cross the line in to too sweet. They didn't skimp on the amount of sauce mopped on these bad boys.

Another example of awesome customer service was when my ribs came out with fries instead of the veggies I subbed. In less then 5 minutes I had a pleasant side salad Good looking out Hipster-Senpai! Dropout again killed the dressing, which was a buttermilk ranch drenched in parm.

Chairs were epic level comfortable, and atmosphere was just right. Who cares what their staff dresses like when the service is top notch?"}
{"text":"meh. I don't see what all the fuss is about. Food's not great for the price, wait staff takes forever to get around to you, even with no one else in the restaurant. Maybe I'm not cool enough to understand why eating here is so great. I've given them a few tries. not for this guy."}
{"text":"We ordered the antipasta and pretzel fondue, we were definitely not disappointed. The antipasta had fresh asparagus and port salut cheese which melted in your mouth. The fondue had a cute presentation. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I would recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Have tried dining here several times over the last 5 years.  I stay at Hard Rock about four times a year. Something always wrong at this restaurant. Either billed for things not ordered, or service has been less than stellar. This visit, I was seated promptly by the hostess. I sat there for 10-12 minutes, never once approached by any server. I had a couple of them look at me. Maybe they should be trained to ask if you have been helped and get whomever has that sections attention. I walked out and told the hostess why I was leaving. Hostess didn't even make an attempt to make things right."}
{"text":"I was completely impressed by their spread and prices for ambience!  Such a great venue and restaurant concept.. Modern, fun, delicious and worth every cent!  Must try's:  rainbow trout, salmon and king crab legs... For dessert:  caramel custard and monkey bread.  

Definitely my new crave in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great name, lousy food which stems from a very poor menu selection. Too noisy to enjoy a conversation. Sorry, will not be back. Too many great places in the area."}
{"text":"This place is OK.  Great location.   Nice patio, and not too loud.   Decent service.    Food I had was mediocre though.   Fish and Chips was not good nor fries."}
{"text":"I always have a great time at culinary dropout! I love the interior design of this location, very industrial. Came for a birthday dinner a month ago and had an excellent experience! So I decided to come back again today and bring a friend for a lunch date and had another great time. Our waiters have always been so personal, friendly, and attentive. :) definitely must try the \"deviant behavior\" drink it's so good and lasts a while because you refill as you drink with the side of shock top. appetizers: the pretzel fondue is enough to share for like 3-4 people they give you so much pretzel bread but it's literally so warm and the perfect starter. Prosciutto deviled eggs are delicious too. (I do wish you could taste a lil more of the prosciutto though). I've also tried the pierogis which were phenomenal! The seared ahi tuna salad was excellent, my friend and I split it and it was enough to fill us up with all the appetizers prior. Previous visits I've tried the black muscles, Korean style rib-eye, and 36 hour pork ribs. All excellent choices! This visit we tried the banana cream pie and it was honestly one of the best I've ever had! Always a great place to go to :)"}
{"text":"Very good, everything from scratch. The pretzels, fried chicken, biscuit and fries were the best I've had in a long time.  Matched it with a new Belgium slow ride IPA.  We are from Milwaukee, and wished we had a place like this back home.  Free ping pong, shuffleboard and bag toss too."}
{"text":"Another great Fox Restaurant . Steak and potatoes for the win ! The pork nachos weren't as good as expected , the cheese was too much . On the other hand the pretzel fondue was the bomb.com. My drinks were to strong and the waiter was more than happy to get me something else . Would go again !"}
{"text":"A new favorite of mine! Sitting at the bar and waiting a little bit for a table (30-40 mins w/o reservations, 10-15 with, on a Friday night) is fine with me - the meats and cheeses being sliced behind the bar smell amazing!

I LOVE the atmosphere; the decor in here represents my dream great room/patio. It's industrial and dark on the inside with a sizable patio right beyond garage style doors. The strands of lights outside are quaint and there is a living wall with mirrors hanging from it on the left, love it. They do, of course, play rock music, even with that though, the overall vibe is very calm.

The Beer: not a huge selection, but a good selection. I had some Moose Drool and my husband had Abita Amber. The Food: those meats and cheese I've already mentioned are a great way to start your meal. They give you a list when you are seated and you can choose what you'd like and how much (exactly how you would order rolls at a sushi place). I had the Pub Burger for my entree, it was great! Whether for drinks or dinner, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It was just ok. Nothing extra special in my opinion. It was good just not what I expected I guess. The best part was talking to the table sitting next to us from Canada."}
{"text":"I have dined at Culinary Dropout twice, both before concerts. Even though I made a reservation each time (7pm on a Tuesday, 8pm on a Friday), it didn't seem necessary. My guest and I were seated without a wait. The ambience is cool, yet comfortable. It is difficult to identify servers since they do not have a uniform, but they are very attentive. 

On to the food...like all of the previous posters, you will do yourself a disservice if you don't have the soft pretzels with provolone fondue. If you don't use all of the cheese, save it for your meal. My husband dipped his fries in it and also spread it on his perfectly grilled burger. I had the chicken club sandwich. The chicken breast was grilled, tender, and flavorful. With the turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard, it was a perfect combination of flavors and textures. 

I highly recommend saving room for dessert. This was my favorite part of the meals. The monkey bread is baked when you order it, served warm a la mode. Very delicious. However, I think my new favorite is the caramel custard. The very generous portion of the salted caramel custard has a consistency similar to creme brûlée. It is topped with a thick layer of caramel syrup and their own delicious caramel corn. It is decadent and rich, more than enough to share with one or two people. 

This restaurant may be a good replacement for a fun meal since Johnny Smalls closed."}
{"text":"fun atmosphere for lunch.  Parking garage was also conveniently located behind or above the restaurant. Wonderful sandwiches."}
{"text":"Turkey Pastrami on a pretzel roll! The beer selection is ok, the mixed drinks are better."}
{"text":"Lots of hustle and bustle. Live music Friday and Saturday nights. The guy that plays the music on Saturday night is ridiculously talented. I'm going to go there some Saturday night just to eat pretzels with the cheese fondue and listen to that guy perform."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed being at this place. Our waiter definitely knew what he was doing and since I have to eat gluten free, the fact that he could name off what I could eat, impressed me. On top of that, it was the finest gluten free beer I've had in a year. The live music with a vibrant atmosphere was refreshing. The yard games made waiting for our table fly by, time wise. The overall quality and portions of food was spectacular, I will be come back; without a doubt. Great job as a concept for a restaurant and bar, see you again soon."}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  The parking situation is a pain but the atmosphere, food, and pricing were great.  The live music was a bonus.  The appetizers were excellent.  The drink prices were reasonable.  Very friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"The soft pretzels are a must do! The staff is always friendly and accomodating (during restaurant week one of the menu items that I wanted to try was not on the menu. In speaking with the chef I mentioned wanting to try it and he said he would kindly make the substitution for me). With all around good choices on the menu, they have one of the best outside dining experiences that I have been to so we enjoy coming here in the spring months for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was just good.  Not great...good.  Nothing super impressed us except the outdoor seating area. The staff is nice.. hipsters...our guy seemed like he was trying his best to be polite, and ended up coming off weird. We started off with the pretzels with cheese...good...save yourself $12 and go to your nearest Auntie Annies pretzels..its the same just much bigger.  The Bistro steak had a good flavor with the Gorgonzola and balsamic reduction...the meatloaf.........dont order it.  You get 1 one inch thick ketchup glazed slice with mashed potatoes and boiled green beans...its not worth $18. The flavor wasn't worth $18. The experience of it wasn't worth $18.  It was edible.
So overall..you won't hate this place..its got a catchy hipster vibe..but there's better places to go."}
{"text":"The muscles were AMAZING!  They were simple yet the flavors were perfectly balanced.  The chilled asparagus were also perfect and balanced.  The customer service is always great!"}
{"text":"Went here because a friend of mine suggested it. And I'm glad she did. I guess tonight was the official real opening (said my server) . My only complaint about my experience was that the wait staff had no identity. None of them were wearing name tags nor did they have an official uniform. But that did  not take away from good service. Was just an observation.

Now to the food. I ordered the fried chicken. It says on the menu that it is worth the wait. Well I really didnt wait that long. Out came a plate with 3 pieces or perfectly cooked chicken, accompanied by mashed potatoes, cole slaw and a very fresh biscuit. Everything was great. The batter on the chicken was crispy and flavorful. There may even be some cumin in there. And I did order some dessert to go...the bourbon black bottom pie. I cant give a review because I haven't tried it yet.

Definitely a great experience. Also, from a male perspective, between the female staff and other females dining at the place there are a lot of things to look at. Including the tv's.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Mixed....success depends on your agenda for that day.  Busy, popping, happening and great band - scores high.  Other scores average.  Went there last night (Sat) with two girlfriends (6:30pm).  Sound system was so loud we couldn't talk to each other and couldn't really have a good discussion with waitress re recommendations.  Shared antipassi.  Had we understood more about how blockbuster good it is we would have selected all the options and just had that.  I asked the waitress to recommend Shrimp salad vs tuna salad and was shocked when she said shrimp because if tuna salad is served seared normally kicks shrimp's ass.  Two of us ordered it and were terribly disappointed.  I agree with another yelper it was a tiny fried popcorn shrimp salad.  I also agree with another yelper - the place is inconsistent.  They need some mystery diners to fine tune their offering.  All that being said I will go again with another group of people and have a totally different experience because we will choose to sit at the bar and drink, snack on the antipassi and listen to music."}
{"text":"Yes, the reviews are accurate. This place is bomb.com. The pretzel fondue appetizer is a must. Perfectly cooked pretzel balls with a beery-cheesy dip. I went for the fried chicken plate. It was soooooo good. They have fun games in the back area of the seating. There were 100 children playing here, so I think if you have kids it's a good place for them to be entertained. This place is huge."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday before making my drive back home to San Diego. Awesome location. I see a lot of people complaining about the complimentary valet parking. There is street parking too if you don't want those services. Seems this area in Phoenix is the place to go for new restaurants! This location has a few restaurants under one roof (one hostess stand). There was no wait. The staff was friendly. The food was great and the concept is awesome. Outside in \"the yard\" they have ping pong, bean bag toss, TVs and a bar. We have something similar to this is San Diego... but I wish there were more. I'll be coming back during another visit to check out the live music they have!!"}
{"text":"This place is damn good to say the least!  For those of you that don't know this is one of Fox's restaurants.  They know what they are doing.  We had several meats and cheeses and they were all awesome.  We also had the Soft Pretzels and Cheese/Fondue, and it was freaking awesome.  I found myself using the cheese for just about anything.  I know that sounds kind of gross, but it was so good.  Then again I was drinking....  I had the Fish & Chips.  It was good.  I have nothing negative to say about this place.  It is almost worth 5 stars in my mind, but I really need to be blown away, or have something amazing happen during the meal to give the all mighty 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place was super über cool.  

Great views into the fantastic production kitchen, fun lighting throughout and great graphic atmosphere.  I loved all the tactile elements, but the food and drinks also delivered at high marks.  

Great drink selection for all, and a nice menu of unique takes on standard food retail staples.  Get a reservation if you can, but have a drink and enjoy the atmosphere if you have to wait.  The place is huge but very popular right now.  

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants! I love everything from the cleverly named and delicious menu items, the tasty selection of cocktails and beers, the hip and glamorous decor that Fox Restaurants are known for and the friendly wait staff. Also, your food tends to come out really quick which when you're ravenous is always good to know. This is the kind of restaurant that I'm never not in the mood for. I recommend ordering the pretzel fondue (a must have really), the Mac Burger (which is their take on the Big Mac) and to wash it down with a Wild Blue beer. A meal that's worthy of your cheat day! Delish!"}
{"text":"Service was really bad. Servers too busy talking to each other than servicing tables. Ribs came out dry and my wife's steak was cold. Took 35 minutes for my bad appetizer to come out.  Stay away plenty of options nearby."}
{"text":"You guys should really update your yelp page to what type of environment this is. Is it 21+? Your yelp page says kid friendly?????"}
{"text":"First time here, new favorite. You can create your own antipasti plate, and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING. Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had. Service was good, Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful. Monkey bread is also stellar. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been to both the Tempe and Scottsdale locations and was really impressed by the comfort, friendly staff and relaxing atmosphere at each one.  The food was solid, and I really like the indoor/outdoor bar area at the Fashion Square location.  I'm a fan of all the Fox restaurants, and this one did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Beautiful setting, the environment and atmosphere was great to get the night going. The best part was the food. Perfect portions and you can definitely taste the freshness of it all. Chef Steve was awesome as our server Lauren (sorry if I spelt your name wrong) they explained each dish along with the spices and sauces in it. Two thumbs up for me. I will for sure be going back, most likely with a group of friends."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really large which is great because I'm sure it gets packed on the weekends. Appetizers were grilled asparagus and deviled eggs. The asparagus was chilled. Makes no sense to me to pull something off a hot grill, stick it in the fridge then serve it on a plate. Long story short, I like my grilled asparagus hot.

Sweet potato cannelloni with mushrooms was simply delicious, but scarce. The dish wasn't terribly expensive, but for the amount of money I would have liked more. I am not a fan of mushrooms, but ate those just because I was still hungry. I came really close to licking the plate instead I just nibbled on my husbands fries.

Our waiter was also the bartender. Water glasses were never refilled because he was busy at the bar. Lastly, the music was too loud for a lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Came here for my fiance's one year anniversary with the company and I love the food!
The place looks pretty cool and they have a patio, bar, and some games. 
Our waitress was super nice and attentive. I can't remember her name as I'm writing this 3 weeks later.
The charcuterie was awesome and what made it more enjoyable is that it's customizable. You can choose the meats, cheeses, and sides that are all a part of it. 
We also ordered the fried chicken, corn ravioli, sliders, and pork ribs. Everything tasted great but it was a lot of food. 
We didn't have any room for dessert but took a monkey bread home. Upon returning to Cali, we all took a bite and agreed that it was also very very good.

But my favorite thing at this place would be the pretzel fondue. The bread is so soft and pretzel-y and the cheese is so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Definitely a must get here."}
{"text":"Cocktails were excellent the view is cool of the Hard Rock pool. Try their chips, I put lemon on them. 

Appetizers are truly delicious, their cocktail?? It feels like a double shot. 

Cool spot"}
{"text":"We went to culinary drop out and enjoyed our meal. We had the jambalaya, beef stroganoff, chicken curry, fish and chips & a side of bread. 
Our friend ordered a salad & it came with no croutons....he needed carb crunch in his life. He asked our waitress and they made him fresh croutons. It did take a long minute BUT well worth the wait....THEY WERE YUMMY!!! Yup we all had to try one. We were all happy with our food. The chicken curry came with this magnificent sauce so that's when we ordered a side of bread to dip with.... DELISH!!! 
I would highly recommend the curry chicken I think that was the best plate of the evening & don't forget the bread.
There is indoor & outdoor seating and we loved the decor. Our waitress was sweet but a little slow. I do feel the place was a bit pricey for what you get.
Overall I would give this place a 3.5 but cant figure out how to do 1/2 a star! lol"}
{"text":"The culinary dropout looks like a interior design dropout  designed it.  The big comfy seats really aren't made for eating meals in. The waitress was nice. The pretzel fondue was pretty damn tasty. I ordered the bistro steak. It was just ok. The side of Fries were very good, but the blu cheese sauce was just not that good and the quality of steak wasn't wonderful. The experience as a whole was just ok. My girlfriend however loved the sandwich she ordered."}
{"text":"I have been to the scottsdale location which I think made better food. We had the fish and chips and the fried chicken neither were very memorable. Their potato chips we had were about the best thing we had there.!The restaurant has an unnecessary hipster feel you cant really tell who is working there and it was 115 degrees outside and it felt just about as warm inside. This is Arizona be generous with your A/C."}
{"text":"Good food and comfortable atmosphere.

That's for those that just need to scan real fast for the best parts.

Fondue with pretzel bread dippers were awesome.  I had the warm Italian grinder.  I really like the meats, peppers, cheese and bread but prefer my hot/warm sandwiches do not have any lettuce or tomatoes on it.  It was not mentioned on the menu so I'm warning you now.  I liked the fries, skinny and crispy.

I also tried a bite of the shaved prime rib dip and really liked it.  Other items I had a bite of: the MAC burger had quality meat but was over cooked.

We sat outside, it was the first week of November, gotta love this desert for this reason alone.  We were very comfortable and served very well by a handsome gentleman but for the life of me I cannot remember his name.  He had tattooed arms.  Oh wait, so did other servers.  They all seemed nice.

I will be back Dropout."}
{"text":"Top 5 restaurants in Vegas. When you come here, be sure to get:

- Soft Pretzels & provolone
- Oysters! (always so fresh & delicious 
- Burratta
- House Potato Chips
- Brussels Sprouts (antipasti menu) 
- seared tuna salad
- rainbow trout
- I'm sure there are a ton of other delicious items but I may be biased because I am pescetarian ;) 

Service is always excellent, drinks are delicious, food is delicious, outdoor patio is fun, atmosphere and decor are lovely!"}
{"text":"Came here on Monday late in the afternoon. The cocktails were really delicious. I had the jalepeno limonada and one other one. Both were very tasty.

Food was hit and miss. 

The brussels sprouts were fantastic... Perfectly cooked and crispy and the sauce was super flavorful and addictive. Definitely would recommend these. 

The broccoli was gross. Couldn't taste the chili oil... and the sauce underneath it was disgusting. 

The crusty bread wasn't so great either. Didn't taste the garlic and there wasn't much balsamic on it."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on the list for a while but we finally had time in our schedule to make it - and we glad we did!  The pretzel bites are awesome.  The turkey sandwich was great also and the coleslaw that paired with it was fresh and wonderfully flavored.  The Caesar salad was great too!  The Hard Rock Casino also has free parking and easy access from the garage (as opposed to most other casinos on the strip).  Well worth the trip to the Hard Rock to eat here!!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Bad service don't count on your reservation to be fulfilled. Horrible service. The workers acted as if they are above there guest because they work there! Someone needs to remind them they serve fried chicken. They are no better then someone who works at KFC!!! The manager is rude. The server did not want to split checks and turned mad when we asked him to do so. Tip: if you work in the hospitably business be hospitable! Prefer the location on Bethany home!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the girls for a girls night out (Hey Magic Mike!) Drinks were amazing, service was great and I the food was yummy. Loved the whole vibe too.. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were delicious.   Cool hanging outside.  Great atmosphere. The mussels are a must have."}
{"text":"This place was cool.  Its huge has great bartenders and good live music. 
Definitely want to spend more time here. its just far enough away from \"mill\" to be tolerable."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday and I really liked it! My friend got a hibiscus mimosa and that sh*t was SO fire. The staff was cool, food was delicious, the yard looked like a blast, misters were clutch, and the atmosphere was perfect for my friends birthday happy hour!

The only down side was the mandatory valet. I didn't have cash, so it made me look like an A hole, which is unfair because I'm quite nice."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in for lunch before some shopping. 

I loved the decor and environment of the Scottsdale location, we were seated and greeted quickly. Service was certainly above average, no complaints for that. It was a little warm in the the restaurant, so much so that we wished we has sat outside where we could have enjoyed a breeze.

Certainly go with the pretzels for an appetizer, they were soft and flavorful, the cheese was solid. Drink options were exceptional. 

The wife got the Salmon entree, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I got the meatloaf, which was pretty tasty as well, although the green beans seemed a little under-seasoned and the mash was nothing to brag about. 

I feel like CD might be worth trying again sometime, and I would have likely gone with. A 3 star rating, except that the wife loved her Salmon."}
{"text":"This place is pretty busy every time when I stop by. The parking is always full but valet parking is a great option too. It is a trendy place & loud talking. They have a really reasonable price on the menu with good foods."}
{"text":"Good portions and cocktails overall. The best thing I tasted was the pretzel and fondue appetizer. Stay away from the curry chicken, it was small and didn't have much chicken in it."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the portion size. 

$18 for a slice of meatloaf, a small dollop of bland TV dinner mashed potatoes, and a child's handful of green beans. 

I personally can make better. 

Also, I somehow got lint all over my clothes while dining here. Possibly from the napkin."}
{"text":"Appetizers were great! Deviled eggs and the bread are a must get. They also split portions in half very nicely so you can try two different entrees or more."}
{"text":"average food. great ambiance and atmosphere. drinks werent bad, i liked the jalepeno limonada.  pretzels were all dried up though."}
{"text":"Just OK. Nice atmosphere, normal service. The pretzels were OK, not amazing at all. It's pretzels and melted cheese, nothing to rave about. Most of the dishes were ok, the ribs were good. Don't think it's worth the money. I have experienced better for this price tag, in Vegas."}
{"text":"What can I say... This place is so cool and the food was delicious. I loved it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Listen Linda, my new BFF Rayann was our server extraordinaire and our experience started from her warm welcome at the front door. 5 stars on all fronts: food, recommendations, presentation, style, atmosphere...Rayann you name it. She was off the charts!!!! And did I mention the eye candy we were served and the mouth watering, flavor explosions? Seriously RUN, don't walk to lunch and enjoy an epic experience at this hip and uber cool."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife and 5 year old kid on a thursday night around 8pm to have dinner. At first we were really excited because of the great reviews but was very disappointed as no one took our order for almost an hour. All waiters are too busy to attend to us so we ended up leaving and very frustrated"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. You have to try the  home made chips and onion dip. The beef dip was huge and the ramen soup, delicious."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Hip and new. A casual restaurant with great food. I had the meatloaf which was a strange choice but it was good but the potatoes and green beans were better. 
My friend had the trout and kept raving about how good it was. We didn't stay long, it was only a Tuesday night but the place is definitely a great hangout on a weekend."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish and chips, the fries and chips tasted good but it was not fried properly, the fish kept falling apart when I picked it up and the fries were limp. Who was in charge of the fryer anyway; a dropout? Lol"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! The building is very trendy and has a lot of interesting features. Definitely need a reservation before going over. Here on a Wednesday night and there is a 45 min wait. The staff is friendly and offer to call your cell phone once table is ready. Valet parking was convenient and prompt. Noise level was good for friends and laugh, not suitable for a first date. There are lots of fun entertainment games as well you can play before or after your meal. The crowd of people were of all different ages, from a 6 year old girl to an 80 year old man. Everyone was laughing and having a good time!"}
{"text":"I'm so over this place. I've given it so many chances, and it's just.so.mediocre. Food is bleh, drinks are expensive, atmosphere is pretentious. I know it's Scottsdale, and I'm all about the trendy, fabulous feel. But you have to deserve the crowd by delivering tasty food, good drinks, and on-top-of-it service. Culinary Dropout definitely dropped out of school when those topics were being taught. Time to restructure, Fox Restaurants."}
{"text":"Great place. Great booze, beer, and wine selections. They say they don't have uniforms but I've been here several times over the past 5 years and the clothing of the staff hasn't changed. So there's that."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place! While I think the Hard Rock Hotel is a little bit too much of a party hotel for my taste, this restaurant was the highlight of our stay. Our waitress, Lorna, was great. We had a few drinks, the mussels & a burger. All was quite delicious and tasted fresh. Great food for the price!"}
{"text":"Had a great time eating and playing. Had to go a little early on the weekend so the kids could play on the patio. No kids allowed on patio after 6 pm on the weekend."}
{"text":"It's a basic American restaurant, but it's done WELL. 

As a mainstay of The Yard, you can opt for the raucous, outside seating. I opted for something a bit more dim. Intimate, even. It's man-cavey with all the sports playing, even if there's no sound. The bar has plenty of space, and is comfortable as well. 

Beyond the appetizers (I swear I'll try those pretzels!) it is going to be sandwiches, burgers, and salads all the way down. Nothing really jumped out to me screaming \"try this!\" so I went with their Pub Burger. It was simple, but delicious and filling. I'd grab this again, but not before their salmon avocado toast or something like that. I need something more millennial to keep my Yelp-savvy superpowers, after all. 

You can wash anything down with the generous beer selection, or even the cool cocktail menu. La Vida Verde is cool, but probably just because I have a bias toward all things with jalapeno. Others, like \"Between you and Me\" with just vodka and grape juice are just plain lazy. 

Overall, I don't think you can really go wrong here. Service is nice, and the menu is capable of pleasing many picky eaters. For some reason, I am very partial to the atmosphere and will definitely be back with a couple friends."}
{"text":"Good afternoon all I just want to give a shout out to Alex. He was a great server had great customer service skills. They came in from Las Vegas Nevada for the weekend .this was my first time going to this  restaurant.  I was impress with the food , environment and like I mention the great customer service from Alex ."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Fantastic atmosphere. Amazing place to go to break away from the norm."}
{"text":"Like this place a lot. We had the meatloaf, a burger and fried chicken and all were excellent.  The pretzel & cheese app was amazing.  
Cant wait to come back in summer and sit outside near the pool."}
{"text":"Culinary dropout is a really great place to hang out with friends and share some food. The ambiance is really cool and the menu is fantastic. My boyfriend and I came here for the first time the day after Valentines Day to beat the crazy rush of people. We started of with some great beer and ordered a starter of mussels. Unfortunately the mussels were accidentally put in as meatballs so or server had to correct that which resulted in the mussels being served with our meals. I didn't mind though, it was nice to go with my cannelloni. And we enjoyed the outdoor seating very much. It was so relaxing.  Next time I hope to come for dessert!"}
{"text":"Another place that I've bookmarked for a long time. My girlfriends and I were going to see Magic Mike for a bday. We decided to check out Culinary Dropout before the show. Overall, the place exceeded me expectation, maybe because I've heard so many mixed reviews. Service was attentive. There was live band going on on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was great. 
 
There were six of us. We ordered table full of stuff and shared. I've tried the following.

1. Pomegranate yuzu mule (1/5): did not enjoy my drink. Wouldn't get it again. 

2. Thai chill chicken wings (4/5): pretty tasty wings. Although I would like it spicier. 

3. Bbq pork belly nachos (5/5): I enjoyed the nachos a lot.

4. Pretzel and provolone fondue (4/5): pretty good combo. Would order it again. 

5. Garden Kale salad (3/5): the flavors was good but bit too salty. Wish they can add quinoa or something to add in the additional texture. 

6. Bistro steak and fries(2/5): did not enjoy the steak. The meat quality was meh. 

7. Rainbow Trout (3/4): decent but not memorable. 

8. The meatloaf (4/5): it was not too bad but not the best meatloaf I've had. 

Overall, we had the great time trying out different appetizers and entrees. We enjoyed the live band as well. Will return again!"}
{"text":"My friend and I attended the pre grand opening and were greeted by a friendly staff.  Our waitress was fantastic (Jesssica).  
We had the salmon appetizer with sliced tomatoes, onions, egg, and crispy crunchy bread.  
I had the rainbow trout which was topped with fresh green beans and was quite tasty.  I think the menu price is high since there is no soup or salad or potatoes included.  My friend had the barbequed ribs served with fries and slaw.  The slaw left a lot to be desired as it was dry and I prefer my slaw creamy and no vinegar in the sauce.  The ribs were just OK as the sauce was not up to my taste standards nor my friends.  I thought a little spicy whereas I prefer mine to be sweet.  
Tried the tomato soup but did not like whatever spices they used. For dessert we shared a chocolate tart which was great.  
Since my friends does not drink and I do not drink alcohol I had one of my favorite beers (Kiltlifter).  They do have Moose Drool but were not serving it that afternoon.
I may try this place sometime for lunch as prices may be more afordable then.
My favoites tastes were the crispy bread, trout, and the tart."}
{"text":"For our first time we had a great time! Our server was very knowledgable about the menu especially the drink menu. Culinary Dropout has to have some off the most creative drinks I've seen in a while. Everyone mentioned the pretzels on Yelp and they were right! The cheese sauce was velvety and delicious and the pretzel bites had the perfect texture. My girlfriend and I both couldn't finish our sandwiches because they are pretty big. I will definitely be going back to try the charcuterie menu."}
{"text":"Place was cool but the food was nothing spectacular.  We had a large party and they handled that perfectly but everyone said their food was okay.  Based on the prices I would have liked a little more food and a little more flavor."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to hang out and grab a quality bite. This place is essentially a megabar with cornhole, ping pong, and TVs everywhere! If you're looking for a solid night out and you're not into the club scene, you should grab your posse and head here."}
{"text":"Wow what a find! Huge place, all sort of seating; Regular tables, family style seating for large groups,  bar seats, a few TVs up around wall for latest games. Then later on at night they will have music on stage. Oh that's just the one room. They have a second large room with pool tables and other games. Then there are nice sofas around the room to sit and chat! 
Now for the food! We started with an app. Had the pierogies. Awesome! I had the fried chicken, mashed potatoes and coleslaw. Chicken was very moist. You get three pieces and can choose white and/or dark meat. Hubby had the meatloaf, mashed potatoes and green beans. Yummy! Wish I lived near hear to explore menu. Will have to come back to AZ."}
{"text":"The CONCEPT is cool. I came here about 6 or 7 times during their 1st year. I tried the ramen, and while the ingredients were authentic and fresh, the broth had no depth. Good ramen is about broth flavor. 
Later, I brought kids along. The waitress was clearly uncomfortable with kids. The food was great, the courtyard with games was great, but the service was not friendly. 
Another day, I invited an associate with me for a business lunch and the waitress (different waitress) kept staring at or reading the paperwork each time she walked by. She didn't  hide it, so I am not mistaken. 


Finally, I drove back again, expecting to get a gormet pretzel&cheese. I found it odd that, ahen I tried to park I was intercepted by valets who literally would not allow me to park my own car. 
I can't park my car? No, ma'am. 
So I went home. The clearly heard the elderly couple behind me and they left too, for the same reason. 

There are things I love. I love the atmosphere, decor and co-op feel of \"THE YARD\". I appreciate the kitchen staff. Like I said, cool but not solid. 

I'll have to try them again soon to see if anything has changed.
My guess is the service was not that great because everything, including the staff, was still new."}
{"text":"Def go back! Great food, tried a burger and it was delicious. The location is fun to walk around before or after. Great vibes and great service , our waitress was very nice and quick! Good for groups, a little dark inside and loud, but very popular spot!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to get drinks and food during the day.  It has great indoor/outdoor seating at the bar and tables.  You can hear the music from Rehab it's a good time!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty awful dining experience here last week, but I came back after Haley (the manager) reached out to me. She was kind, honest, and it was nice to see that she really values genuine customer feedback and cares about continuously training her employees. 

Came back with a different group of friends, none of which have been here before. We all had a good time! It was right after a work day on an early Tuesday evening. I had the grilled chicken club with bacon and a side of fries and it was delicious! The group also had the BBQ pork nachos and cheese fondue with pretzels as appetizers and those were to die for. The service this time was superb. Even though it was pretty busy for a Tuesday night, he checked in with us frequently.

This was a completely different experience compared to the first one, and I'm so happy I gave CD another chance. I know every place has room for improvement, and I think they are in good hands with Haley proactively seeking ways to do so."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. Came for a friend's birthday dinner on a Saturday night so it was busy, but the customer service was still pretty good. We got the BBQ Pork Belly Nachos, Fried Chicken, and the Green Chili Stew. The nachos came in a big serving size and was DELICIOUS. Everything else, however, was just decent. Nothing too memorable about the fried chicken or the stew.

The environment here is very upbeat and lively as part of \"The Yard.\" If you're looking to have a nice, peaceful dinner, I don't recommend coming here. But if you're with a group or want to have the flexibility to have dinner, drink at the bar, and also play some games in the backyard area with loud music (live music on some nights), then this is the right place for you.

Parking is complimentary, but don't forget to tip your valet attendants!"}
{"text":"This review is about the environment and not food since I never had the chance to try it. 
This was my second attempt to 'try' and eat there. 
1. It's located in the Yard which is confusing when you haven't been there. Everyone is quick to point you in a direction that doesn't help.  
2. It so crowded and loud and this last time the entire patio was closed for private party.  I wish the valet mentioned that when we waited in a long parking line with the idea to eat outside. 
Both time we ended up leaving and going somewhere else.  I won't try it again it is sooo ANNOYING



They did reach out after this review and offer to have is back on them which I think is great.  I live in San Diego so not possible but still like that they responded"}
{"text":"This place is very much for hipsters. Specifically rich hipsters. If you have a beard and man bun like the entire male staff, you will fit in. The drinks are extremely expensive and so is the tiny amount of food. However, the outdoor patio is really nice and has a lot of games such as corn hole and ping pong. They also have occasional live music."}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere!
loved the decor, and the place was noticeably clean. 
They offer a fun Blind beer and shot, where you get an unknown brown bag'd can of beer, and without looking grab a random shooter from a bucket. 

pretzel fondue is a must, brilliant concept! delicious!

overall had a very fun night here, would return any chance I got!"}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan. We had a reservation, showed up and were told to come back in 30 minutes or we had to sit outside. It was so windy that the menus kept blowing away. When we finally got moved inside it was freezing cold inside. While many people enjoyed their food I found my Korean Steak to be really bland. Great drink menu"}
{"text":"I'm just going describe the cocktails/food because the Hard Rock has stepped it up big time- to start - craft cocktails: outstanding mule with hard core ginger beer, then I tried the Smashed Irish man which was Jameson and reduced Guinness and it's yummy! I could drink this out of a camelback on a hike! Next, and this is over the course of my week here, I had the grapefruit vodka, fresh squeezed!  Amazing with salty rim. 

Okay now food here is amazing. Real food! Simple yet delectable spices. I had the \"cheap salad\" with homemade buttermilk ranch, it was refreshing and the dressing was so good I ordered mas. I got the Brussels sprouts- they were served cold and I requested hot. They came out lukewarm but flavor was like grilled heaven. Next day I got the antipasto on happy hour. Best six bucks I've ever spent. The BBQ nuts were more addictive than the slots. The mini platter also came with manchego cheese, olives, shaved ham, and more Brussels sprouts!  

Okay, now for the service... Every single person I've encountered at Culinary Dropout had been awsome! They treat customers like friends and seem genuinely happy. 

I've got a new favorite in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was exactly what I was expecting.  Typical Gastropub with trendy decor.  I started off with a Bacon Bloody Mary, which was my absolute favorite part of the meal (haha).  The smoky flavor was present, but not overwhelming.  I could have had 3, except for the fact that it was pretty darn strong.  For $10 a pop, I enjoyed that it had a little kick to it.  

I ordered a chicken sandwich because our waiter told us that all the bread was house made and raved about the sandwiches.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  My two brunch partners got salad, which they said were very tasty.  

If you're staying at the Hard Rock, I'd definitely give this place a try.  It offers something a little different from the steakhouses and sushi bars."}
{"text":"Came here once before and the service was *ok but the food was pretty good. Came here tonight to bring my sister from out of town and after this experience, I'm never going back. Came in and was told I would be waiting an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. Considering it was Friday night and they were kind of busy, I understood and decided to get some drinks. After an hour and a half I decided to go ask the hostesses what was going on and they told me \"there's only a couple more tables ahead of you\". After another half hour of waiting I went up and asked again and they gave me the same answer. What bothered me is that they didn't even seem to care or sympathize that I had been waiting for nearly 2 hours or try to reassure me that I would be called soon (even though we had already watched several tables get seated before us). I'm very disappointed in the service we had experienced and will not be returning, at least to this location."}
{"text":"This was first visit. We enjoyed everything about the experience. From the staff to the food it was top notch. We look forward to our next visit to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I love their chicken curry of all things. Caramel dessert is also fantastic."}
{"text":"Yes yes, the pretzel fondue, of course.  But also, the salted caramel custard.
This is something I would not normally order, but at lunch for a coworkers birthday this was brought out and I'm glad it was. So good.
I had the shrimp Cesar too, and was impressed.
The ice tea was also tasty.
Looking through the drink menu I will be back, after work instead of during, so I can give them a shot!"}
{"text":"The food was great, I had the mussels, my friend had the salmon and my other girlfriend had the trout.  Our server Mitchell was excellent!   Mitchell was busy with lots of tables and he still remembered our birthday girls celebration.  Thank you Mitchell for ending are Culinary Dropout dinner with a great dessert including candles!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation here on a Friday night for my friend's birthday.  They were able to accommodate our large group and the service was great throughout.  There was also a live band who was absolutely fantastic.  We ordered the soft pretzels with provolone fondue to start, and it was a great appetizer, but it was pretty filling, so less orders go farther (we ordered 2).  For the actual meal I ordered the mussels at the advice of the waitress, and I was severely disappointed.  Mussels are one of my favorite dishes and this place just did not cut it.  They were extremely bland and the sauce they came in was absolutely tasteless.  By far the worst I've had.   On the other hand, my friends enjoyed their food and their drinks, so perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing, but it's hard to give it the four stars it would otherwise deserve when the meal I thoroughly disliked was recommended to me."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to go! Loved the live music, great ambiance and awesome food! 

For starters:
We ordered the grilled asparagus and truffle cheddar potato chips from the Antipasti menu. They have a great selection of meats and cheese as well which I will need to come back for! We also ordered the soft pretzels and provolone fondue which is shareable for 4 people! 

For the entree:
We ordered the 36-hour pork ribs which were delicious! It was so tender and basically slid off the bone! 

Only reason I give a 4 star is because service was a little slow! Other than that our experience was great!"}
{"text":"Ordered several Appetizers and a few drinks on a Friday night. Our food was really good. The chopped salad was to die for the nachos was huge.
Service was great."}
{"text":"Restaurant? or Modeling Agency?

About 5 of my buddies and grabbed an early dinner at Culinary Dropout this past weekend. From the hostess to the janitor, everyone in this joint was freaking beautiful. What does this have to do with quality food or service? NOTHING. But its just a fact everyone should know. Boom!

I actually ordered a couple things: Fish N Chips, Grilled Cheese, and The Turkey Pastrami. Without going into details, the Fish N Chips were ridiculously small and the Grilled Cheese was elementary. However, the Turkey Pastrami was incredible. It wasn't as greasy as the usual pastrami and tasty as hell! 

Did I mention the employees? No, besides the fact that they were goddesses, the service was fantastic. I like to ask a waitress how something [that sounds gross] tastes. I wanna test their integrity. I love it when they say, \"Don't order that.\" And that they did! I like honesty. Makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. 

I'd go back. Obviously."}
{"text":"Good food, and even better service. Its reminds me of a place we'd find in Brooklyn, not inside the hard rock cafe. The server kept me company when my bf went to use the bathroom. That's the kind of service you don't get now a days. I hope he sees this, and I thank you (he's 36 lol). The pretzel bites fondue, YUM! The steak was perfectly cooked and the fried chicken was yummy. We ate it all and had no room for dessert. Great job guys, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"My first time here and Culinary Dropout is one if my new favorites! The salmon was crispy on the outside, but moist on the inside and perfectly marinated. The soft pretzels and fondue were perfect! I love the choose your own charcuterie! The service was fantastic, music was hip, atmosphere was lively. My 4 yr old son loved the kids menu too. This is the best of living in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a hip joint with great happy hours, patio banquette seating and a great menu? As most reviewers have noted, don't pass on the pretzel fondue appetizer. The cheese and charcuterie plates are pretty small but they are good. My favorite main course is the korean rib eye cap but the fish and chips are also well executed.

It is a really loud restaurant (so don't bring your mother here) but what is great is the restaurant encourages lingering and hanging out with your friends."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.  Not the fanciest spot but they execute an awesome dining experience complete with some of the tastiest dishes I've ever had. The Korean style brussel sprouts are a revelation. The salmon avocado toast is amazing as well. Definitely worth a visit if you're in town."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now since I started working in Phoenix, AZ. One of my colleagues joked that I would love culinary dropout, because it is trendy and \"so hipster.\" I think I can see where he is coming from. From the miss matched but perfectly flowing furniture, to the live music, and very laid back atmosphere, it is definitely trendy hipster. I love the food. 

Appetizer: Pretzels and Fondue for appetizer are definitely delicious. 

Main Course: I've had the FRIED CHICKEN plate. The food was great, and as the menu says it does take time to make. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was bone in - and I am not a fan of that. I had the MEATLOAF the other day and it was VERY good. All of their food is on point. I don't feel like you could go wrong with any of their dishes! Preservation is always on point too. 

What to Drink: Last but not least what to drink! THE DEVIANT BEHAVIOR is my favorite. For $10 you get a cocktail and a beer to mix to your liking. I think it is so delicious and the price point is awesome! It is a must try!"}
{"text":"I debated for quite awhile with myself about this review.  The fried chicken is the best I've had in Las Vegas.  It was a 6 star dish.  But, the rest of the meal was not, so that's how I arrive at 4 stars.

We had lunch at Culinary Dropout on a weekday around 1.  It was not crowded, a few tables outside and maybe 4 people at the bar.  So, we sat right down.  Our server came right over for our drinks, but after that, service was a little spotty.  I don't know if she was also working tables outside or doing something in the back, but I feel like we went long periods without even seeing her in the restaurant.  So, that was a little annoying.

To start, we had a charcuterie plate.  This includes a good amount of bread and some jam.  We had a blue, a cheddar, and some Iberico ham.  All of it was fantastic, the ham was, of course, the star.  Soft in texture and almost buttery, it's phenomenal.  

For lunch, as I noted above, I had the fried chicken.  This includes 3 pieces, potatoes, a honey biscuit and gravy.  They drizzle a little honey over the chicken.  Not so much that it overpowers the dish or affects the crispiness of the skin, but enough so you get a little sweet taste with each bite.  This chicken was excellent.  Crispy skin that adhered to the meat, seasoned meat, and the meat remained juicy (even on the white pieces).  It's a steal at $22.  This dish came with a lot of hype, I had heard from many people how fantastic it was, and it delivered.  The potatoes were fine, both they and the gravy needed seasoning.  The biscuit was not as flaky as I like, and it was lukewarm.  So, those items were a little disappointing compared to the chicken.  But, I would certainly order this again knowing that the other parts of the dish were not as good as the chicken.  It's that good.

The wife had the grilled cheese and yesterday's soup, which was tomato bisque.  I don't usually care for tomato soups, but I liked this one.  Hearty and had a lot of seasoning.  Good tomato flavored accentuated by the seasoning.  It was of course excellent when you dip the sandwich into the soup.  

I don't frequent the Hard Rock Casino, but I would absolutely return just to eat here again.  I recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is wonderful! The atmosphere is fun and comfortable and very warm and inviting. The different smells of the food are overwhelming, in a great way that makes your stomach immediately excited for food. The food itself was delicious, everything looked and smelled so good. I ended up ordering the Kale Caesar Fried Shrimp Salad and it was delicious! The server recommended getting the shrimp sautéed instead and it was a great decision. I couldn't stop eating it. Others in my group ate burgers, and they were huge and looked so good. The servings are generous and the drinks are good and generous too!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is the new place to be! The food is amazing, the staff are very knowledgeable and friendly and the place looks amazing... I'm telling you i had the Bistro Steak it was perfect and my fiance had the Teriyaki Kobe meat and it delicious.
We would definitively  would like to go back at the place and try some other delicious meal. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE GREAT SERVICE AND GREAT FOOD.

{"text":"Recommended for sure.
Nice patio and great food.
Homemade potato chips were great.
All four of us loved our food, which NEVER happens.
Went with kids at 3pm, so didn't get to see the reportedly fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Outstanding from start to finish!

We made reservations at 7:30 PM. Greeted right away by our server Joel. He was GREAT! So friendly & fun.

Wide ranging menu, with lots of options, including Gluten Free. Offered are amped-up pub-type appetizers, salads, sandwiches and entrees!

Atmosphere: Soulful surroundings. Large area for a variety of activities.-Yard Games and Live Music for the whole family too! 

In our party of 5 we had : shaved prime rib dip, pub burger, roasted salmon, butternut squash cannelloni & the Korean style ribeye caps. 
Presentation on all meals was exquisite... 

I do have to say- I was a little bummed, they no longer have the Raviolis. Our server suggested the cannelloni & that it was very similar. Agreed and it's just as delicious. The Ribeye Caps ( prepared medium) was extraordinary... Highly suggest one of these two dishes. 

The GM checked in on us many times throughout our visit. Friendly, engaging & professional. 

Ended the evening with a deconstructed apple pie & a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Yum!

Stellar service, staff & experience."}
{"text":"The best way to summarize our experience....average.  The wait staff was pleasant enough, but I am not a fan of the waitress taking a seat at the table while taking my order.  I don't know you, please get up and back away!  A few of the waitresses were dressed cute enough, but one girl looked ridiculous!  We actually saw her walking south on 7th St on our way to the restaurant and both my husband and I commented that it was a little early in the day for that type of enterprise. Imagine our surprise when a few minutes later we see her seating guests in the restaurant! 

I had the Pub Burger. It was cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of grill flavor!  My husband had the Prime Rib sandwich.  He liked it except for the cheese.  The fries seemed fresh, but could have been served hotter.  

I do not believe I will return, nor would I recommend to others.  Too many good places to tantalize my tastebuds to waste my time or money coming back to Culinary Dropout.  Maybe they should have stayed in!"}
{"text":"We thought we would give the Culinary Dropout a try since the name is catchy and we had tried their pretzels and fondue at an event we attended for charity.

Cute and very comfortable decor. We ate inside but the outside patio looked inviting and fun.  Music and crowd was not too loud on a Thursday night so we could actually talk over dinner and watch the game.

We ordered the pretzels and fondue and we were overjoyed with flavor! I think it is their claim to fame! Fried chicken was recommended by Yelpers and waiter - nothing special, would not order again. Meatloaf had no flavor, would not order again either. Bacon Bloody Mary was tasty.

Dinner for two with appetizer and  two drinks was $90 bucks with tip. They had a pretzel special but waiter said it was only for happy hour but as we left the restaurant the special said NFL Game prices so hubby went back in and they adjusted the check.

Great service would visit again but just order pretzels, fondue and booze."}
{"text":"Weird location and unique decoration. I felt like I was eating dinner in the cool backyard of a warehouse since we ate outdoors. The theme was very young and hip. Pretty cool hang out place and they had interesting food."}
{"text":"Only 3 stars because their food was amazing and the atmosphere was great! However the service was terrible.  It took us 20 minutes to get drinks at the bar.  The staff was completely uninterested in serving us or merely even glancing our way.  Makes me excited to try the one in Austin to see if I can get the good food but with good service. I'd say if it wasn't for them streaming a game I wanted to see I would of left based alone on service.  We were there for and hour and a half and was only able to get 2 drinks. At the bar ....."}
{"text":"My friend recommended going here after our shopping day. She had been to the 7th Street location multiple times and raved about it. We started off great, our server was friendly, and she was all smiles. Things didn't progress so well. My friends drink didn't come with straws and she needed them to stir her drink. We had to seek someone else's attention. Our order was taken and we ordered the Pork Belly Nachos. Our nachos were delicious, however we were left desiring more meat on them. There was so little meat that i felt like i was eating nachos from Taco Bell. We ordered two plates to share. When the waitress came to check to see how the food was i asked for two sides which she said would be right out.... we left and still didn't get our sides; yet the waitress made eye contact with my friend and i multiple times, and even brought our check and asked if we needed anything else. We kind of felt neglected as the two tables at each side of us had more visits from the waitress than we did. Hopefully the service is something that can be worked on, as this really is a good establishment, and the food and drinks were great!"}
{"text":"Came here for a celebratory jibber with my friends for their new jobs. My first impression of the place was \"wow, very hipster!\" They had ping pong tables and foosball tables. I thought the atmosphere was great. Except the music was soooooooo unnecessarily loud. 

The food was okay. Really overpriced beer food. I wouldn't come here just to eat. The drinks were tasty but they weren't strong enough and pretty overpriced. 

Overall, you're paying for the atmosphere which was not what I wanted. Not sure if I will be back soon. Very gorgeous location and a funky atmosphere. Not for me though since the prices are a bit steep."}
{"text":"Just not impressed... My salad sucked. I ended up sharing my 2 year old's grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Good food, bizarre atmosphere. It was so dark we couldn't see the menus -- thank goodness some nerd at our table had an app with a light. The decor is dramatic with enormous chandeliers and large, rustic tables and then they have big screen tvs with sports on. Weird. 

I loved their a la carte charcuterie and cheese menu. They had unique choices that were delicious. The bread was served with a cherry puree of some sort that is to die for. And the olive oil really is a find, it almost tasted like buttah. 

The beer and wine list wasn't extensive but they had very nice choices. 

Overall I liked it and the staff was attentive. Not sure if I'll make it back there on another trip but I wouldn't be opposed to it."}
{"text":"Best burger ever!  And tonight we could hear ourselves speak instead of blaring overhead music.  But, it was our daughter's 13th bday, so we made sure to have reservations, asked the hostess to tell the waitress it was her birthday and even mentioned it again to the waitress when we ordered her a dessert- but nothing was said to the bday girl. Sad bday face :(    It's busy on a Friday and the waitstaff is very good at keeping the pace fast so they can turn the tables over (I get it, it's a business).  But they also brought us 2 sodas when we only ordered one, but still charged us for it.  Since we were with family, we didn't want to make a big deal about $10 on a $100 plus tab.  But for that, can't do more than 3 stars.  But, I'll be back for the burger.  However, too many missed details for 5 stars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in for a Saturday night date, being new to Scottsdale we didn't make a reservation (Recommend making one). We were fortunate enough to get seats at the patio bar; Alex, the bartender was very kind and always keep an eye out if we needed anything before having to ask. Food was amazing and they have a great drink menu!! 
The only thing I didn't like was the amount of noise once the Live Music was getting set up and the amount of \"mic checks\", it was obnoxious to say the least. 
Will definitely be back but earlier in evening, with a reservation. Thank you again to all the bar staff that checked in on us!"}
{"text":"If you're young, beautiful and hip this is the place to be on a weekend. Yet if you're like us, a little less young and hip you can still blend in. You can make a reservation on Open Table, which I would suggest because the secret is out about this place and it got progressively busier throughout the night. 

The ambiance inside is fun, relaxed, with a dining room area and then a lounge area outside where people were lounging on sofas and playing games. It was really quite unique. In the dining area there is also a stage where there is a difference band that plays live music nightly. 

We started with the pretzels and fondue app as well as the BBQ pork nachos. The pretzels were served hot, soft on the inside and the provolone fondue dip was creamy and delicious without being overwhelming. The nachos were layered with guacamole, sour cream and thick chunks of sweet BBQ pork. 

For my entree I settled on the Fried chicken served with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, a biscuit, and coleslaw. The mashed potatoes left something to be desired, reminded me of an elementary school lunch. The coleslaw was delicious, light and carefully seasoned. The chicken had a great crispy coating with tender juicy meat. The biscuit was large and a little heavier than I like my biscuits.

My husband got the French dip with added jalapeños at the suggestion of our waiter. The meat was tender and juicy. The bread was a little soggy for my preference even before the dip. Overall a solid sandwich. 

We had a great experience and lingered for an extra hour or so. Our waiter never once made us feel rushed and he refilled our drinks regularly without us even having to ask. Overall very happy with the service and experience. Definitely put this on your list of Saturday night dinner spots if you're looking for a good time."}
{"text":"Meh. This place left a pretty negative impression on me. First of all, the \"valet parking\" is incredibly unnecessary. It is just a racket to pay someone to park your car in their ordinary parking lot. Service is sloooooooow. Expect to wait an incredibly long time before you can place an order, and waiting close to an hour after you are done eating to receive your check. Food is standard for an above standard price."}
{"text":"This Tempe location of Culinary Dropout is my favorite. Great vibes, good service, & talented entertainment. Trust me when I say this -- try the pretzels & cheese appetizer !"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of their pretzels and cheese appetizer. I don't even like pretzels but this culinary drop out has completely changed my opinion!"}
{"text":"Would like to give this place 4 stars. 

Came here late at night on a Friday. Wasn't crowded at all. Very nice interior and decor inside. Very comfortable. Live music, excellent vibes for a more relaxed and chill night. (Not very much into clubs and loud music anymore) What was lacking was the service. I get it, it's late at night and it's seat yourself, but just would have liked a little more attentiveness from the staff. We had to ask for menus, and sat at our table for some time before our server came over.

Didn't eat much of the food, but the menu seemed like your typical bar food selection with a few twist. I ordered the monkey bread dessert, that was it. I would definitely say stop by here if you're in the AZ area. A different take on night life. But the service was just a little lacking for me, so maybe come with some friends and be very patient."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner with a visiting friend. It's definitely one of those trendy, modern restaurants you want to take your time eating at. The interior was adorned with cute couches and booths, good for a date or a girls night out!

First off, FREE PARKING garage near the valet booth!!! score!!

we decided to order two dishes and an appetizer to share. Little did we know the provolone fondue (our appetizer) came in hugeee portion, getting us full before our main dishes came out haha But of course, this didnt stop us for digging in. 

The kitchen was nice enough to split the meals on two plates before bringing it out. We got the fried chicken and biscuit as well as the turkey pastrami sandwich (pretzel bun! more pretzel!).

The fried chicken was really tender and juicy inside and out. Every bite pulled us in for another, despite the fact our stomachs were bulging out over our pants (exaggeration). Biscuit was a bit salty but eating it the next day as left over, the taste was just right. 

The sandwich was soo juicy. The combination of turkey, pastrami and pretzel just makes it a complete dish. I loved that there wasn't an overwhelming amount of meat. Tried dipping the entire sandwich in the provolone fondue...best decision of the night.

Im excited for another chance to go.Love to try their happy hour and have a taste of their live music!"}
{"text":"Fun games and atmosphere. Very hip and trendy. But the food seriously sucks. I've had the smoked salmon, pretzels and cheese dip, and grilled cheese sliders. Just extremely unimpressed for the price. If you go go for the drinks and games not the food."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn on this place. The food was good but a tad overpriced although it is in an upscale area, so you are paying up for the area it is in.  We had a couple of kids with our group and no kids menu.  The beer and food list was good and prices were reasonable. I wouldn't come just for the beer or wine though.  We also had to ask a couple of times for little things, like sugar for the iced tea and spoons so service was just so so."}
{"text":"Genuine servers, quality food, and enlightening entertainment is what you will receive when you go to Culinary Dropout. This one in Scottsdale has a particular feeling of passion in the food and building. 

Culinary Dropout is a restaurant I would recommend to anyone and everyone. I love hanging out there and delight in their food that will fulfill any of your needs. From savory Pretzel Bead & Cheese to relishing Ribs, every item on the menu you leaves you wanting more.

When I get to decide where I want to go, I choose here."}
{"text":"Food was excellent -- surpassed our expectations. Ravioli (+chicken), meatloaf, fried chicken, ribs...can't go wrong. Only thing I'd change would be to ask for the brown gravy on the meatloaf instead of the ketchup-based red gravy. Drinks were solid and live music was nice. Place is definitely loud so be ready for that. And short walk to old town..."}
{"text":"This place has the best munchie foods. We went to a show first at the joint and stopped by Culinary Dropout after the concert let out. We were seated outside by the fire pits, very cool vibe. We decided to get a bunch of apps/ small plates to share. We ordered the pretzels with provolone fondue, grilled cheese sliders, smoked salmon, buffalo meatballs, and truffle potato chips. Everything was delicious. I highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"What a super fun place to go and hang out and have dinner with friends! While visiting from Wisconsin my friends told me I had to try this place! Being a huge foodie love to try new restaurants. We decided to go here for dinner one evening and the place was I hopping!!! It was a gorgeous night out and the weight flew by while we enjoyed some delicious cocktails. The place is huge and offers games in the back where people can hang out and enjoy their cocktails. When we got to our table the first thing we had to order was the pretzel balls and cheese dip. This is comfort food to the max! And was absolutely delicious. For dinner I decided to go with the ribs which were fall off the bone amazing! One of my friends ordered the meatloaf with the sauces on the side. And my other friend ordered one of their amazing burgers. The overall experience was fantastic we had such a fun time and it really was a great experience. The next time I'm in town I will for sure be back! If you're looking to have a really fun night with friends definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"amazing food and atmosphere? Fantastic service. Can't wait to comeback and bring friends."}
{"text":"I have the corn cannelloni it and it was excellent, my friend had their meatloaf and she couldn't believe how generous the portion was she said it was also very good. Love their crusty bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Trendy, friendly staff & a culinary adventure fur the taste buds. Makes this San Francisco girl with they'd put a Culinary Dropout version 2.0 in her home town. Order the pretzels fondue or you'll regret it. And the Korean BBQ style rib eye tip."}
{"text":"Long wait was so worth it! The pretzels were amazing and the fried chicken was certainly worth the wait!! Coming back again!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. First off, we went on a Monday night and it was PACKED! So between that and the great reviews I was very excited to try it. I had the Italian salad and the meatloaf. The salad had WAY too much dressing on it. Like soaked. It was not editable. Had they gone light on the dressing it would have been okay. Now the meatloaf  was awful. I would be shocked if the mashed potatoes weren't instant potatoes. It tasted just like the ones served in grade school at lunch. Same with the gravy. And the meatloaf itself was pink throughout. It made me very nervous. And the green beans were boring. Very disappointed all around."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Great ambiance. Delicious food.  Fantastic service.  We stopped in yesterday after we got checked in. Our server, who I wish I remembered his name, was fantastic!  I ordered the Cap't Crunch crusted French toast and a Linenkugel.  I joked that I'd be pairing the French toast with the beer.  He said \"actually it's a great pairing, they're both very sweet. It'll be great\". And he was right. After that'd be was friendly, personable, and genuine. The food was DELICIOUS and the price was just right. 

I'd be back for breakfast this morning but they don't open until 11 and I'm hungry after the festivities last night!

We will definitely be back, and thanks to our server for the outstanding service!"}
{"text":"This place was AWESOME! The pretzels and cheese fondue were so good! And the fried chicken was delicious! Although the the slaw that came with it seemed out of place it was still really good! I will defiantly come back again!"}
{"text":"Typical fox fashion, epic atmosphere, beautiful staff-- oh and the food is great too ;) wasn't surprised when I learned its a fox concept. reluctantly went, pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for happy hour and once for dinner. If you can get there early enough for happy hour and get a seat outside, it's great. Comfortable seating, interesting people watching and pretty good service. 

The soft pretzel & fondue are very tasty as was the cheese plate. When I went for dinner I had the ricotta gnocchi, which was pretty good, but not great. 

I wouldn't go back for dinner again, but I did enjoy my HH experience."}
{"text":"Just want to give a shout out to the best waitress I have every had. ( Jade). Thank you for being so great keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Had a Birthday Party on March 11th.  The service we had was terrible at best. I had a party of 12. Ordered beverages which we had to keep asking about several times before we had them brought to our table.  Good ordering,we had to Flagg down our waitress to ask if we could order. Once we ordered our order was missing three things that people in our party ordered.  

Was not my first time there, I have been there other times. This time the service was horrible."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes about this restaurant but we were honestly super disappointed. I started with a bacon Bloody Mary and it really missed the mark. We also ordered the pretzel bites and the crunchy shrimp Caesar salad. I get those three things pretty much everywhere I go and I'm really just not feelin dropouts version at all. The best thing I ordered though was the shandy with strawberries and shock top. It was so delicious. Sam was our server and she was wonderful. Nice atmosphere might go there again for drinks."}
{"text":"Awesome place to start or end your night.  The staff were great and worked with our large group.  The drink menu is extensive and unique.  Every food item our group ordered was slam-packed with flavor.  Would recommend this place to all as your next night out, I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"First of all, it's an awesome space and concept for a restaurant/bar. I loved all of the different seating arrangements and of course, being able to sit on a patio in a beautiful Arizona night. The restaurant in terms of space and atmosphere definitely gets 5 stars.

What gets me is the price. The mixed drinks and food are good but not superior to other drinks/food I've had for a lower price. Not knocking them, I understand the need for profit...just saying it's tough for college kids to afford going out to places like this. Hopefully happy hour offers a bit of relief for the wallet!"}
{"text":"The wait here is pretty long on the weekends, so you should call ahead and make reservations unless you want to wait 20+ mins, although you can still go to the bar and get a drink while you wait. I definitely recommend the soft pretzel and provolone fondue to start. I got the two soft words cocktail and  fried chicken upon the waitress's recommendation. The drink was fruity as expected and the fried chicken was good, but did not live up to the hype the waitress gave. The monkey bread is really delicious and a perfect way to end the meal. 

The yard is pretty loud and hard to have a conversation there, so I recommend a table inside if you are planning to chat. 

Overall it is a good place to go on the weekend to have some food and drinks and hang out in the yard. The food was pretty good, but pretty pricey for what you get, especially the drinks. The bill adds up quickly here, so beware."}
{"text":"After a bit of persuasion from my friends, Culinary Dropout was my first stop in Scottsdale. There is easy underground parking under the restaurant to keep your car out of the Phoenix heat. We made it to the restaurant during happy hour, and we began our night with the happy hour red sangria. I was definitely not disappointed! Our waitress Mackenzie was sweet and attentive, and she was patient while I waited for the remainder of our party to arrive.

After a few drinks, we ordered the pretzels and cheese. For such a simple offering, I was surprised how great these ended up being! I would suggest ordering them with jalapeños for a bit of added spice."}
{"text":"OMG this place is awesome.

After a VERY long night before, my girlfriends and I needed to get some grub. We sat down in the beautiful restaurant and were quickly greeted by our waiter. He was wonderful! He went over all the options we asked about and made suggestions. The drinks were delish, the tuna salad was AMAZING and the fried chicken... I might marry that chicken. 


Needless to say, I will be back!"}
{"text":"It was just after 11 AM and the fiancée and I were waiting for our room at the Hard Rock to be readied.  We decided to grab lunch while we waited and made the call to try Culinary Dropout.  Culinary Dropout is a part of a chain of restaurants from Fox Restaurant Concepts primarily in Arizona but across the West.  Culinary Dropout describes itself as a gastropub with \"creative cocktails\" and an \"inked-up\" staff.  It lived up to the description and it was good fit within the Hard Rock.

While we were looking over the menu, we started off with drinks.  I had the Maria Pepino ($10) made with Espolon Blanco tequila, spiced tomato juice, pickled pepper juice and garnished with an olive, pepper, and lime.  It was nicely balanced and spicy.  The pickled pepper juice made for a great accompaniment to the light tequila.  To accompany our food, I ordered the Last Man Standing ($10) made with Old Overholt rye and spiced tomato juice, served with a salt & pepper rim and a dill pickle spear.  Being a big fan of rye whiskey, it was even more satisfying than my first round.  For our meal, we split a pair of appetizers, the Black Mussels ($13) and Grilled Artichokes ($13), and the Korean Style Ribeye Cap entrée ($32).  We received maybe a pound of mussels that were fresh and properly cooked.  They were bathed in a flavorful broth made with spicy sausage of an undetermined type (I assumed chorizo), amber ale, and accompanied by a couple of slices of grilled bread.  It was a satisfying dish.  The grilled artichokes were less successful.  We received a single, small-sized artichoke cut in half, brushed with oil, grilled, seasoned with sea salt and served with lemon aioli.  While the artichoke really had a great grilled flavor, picking up a nice smokiness, from what I'm assuming was from a wood-fired grill, the small size of the head did not withstand the cooking well, drying it out, reducing the already small amount of \"meat\" to be found.  It was overpriced and a disappointment.  Our Korean Style Ribeye Cap (maybe a 6 oz. cut) was cooked perfectly to our requested medium rare and and seemingly topped with a red chili pepper, kimchi-style sauce and pickled vegetables and cilantro.  It was immensely flavorful.  Therein lies the conceptual problem with the dish.  The ribeye cap is nicknamed \"Butcher's Butter\" and is touted to be the tastiest cut of beef.  Sadly, the bold sauce covered up the meaty goodness of a cut that probably should've been left unadorned.  I liken the use of ribeye cap in this dish to that of making hamburgers with A5 kobe beef...a waste of a great piece of meat.  A different, less expensive, cut of meat should've been used for this otherwise tasty dish, which could've dropped the price by $7-10.

In the end, Culinary Dropout got its GED (Good Enough Dining).  Service was a strength as it was friendly, attentive, and really made us feel like welcomed guests.  Its cocktails were well conceived, well made, and a solid value.  The food, however, while flavorful, suffered from questionable decision making on how dishes were prepared and from pricing that did not offer a lot of bang for the buck."}
{"text":"I like to bring my out of town friends here for dinner because I like the laid back but classy atmosphere! It's a nice break from the strip too because the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino is a little bit off the strip. I have loved everything I've tried so far!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Texas and reserved for a party of 6 and it's restaurant week. food was amazing. Appetizer was salmon bruschetta, sangria for cocktail, glazed salmon with veggies and dessert was caramel custard. Service was excellent and waitress was a doll. Atmosphere was perfect for a Monday night. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"My stomach started to growl and my head got light headed. It could have been the weather, but most likely it must have been lunch time. Im not particularly fond of this weather, but i am fond of this place that i stumbled into. 

The ambiance is different from what i am use to seeing from a restaurant. When you walk in and look up, you see massively beautiful chandeliers. I pretty much want to sing from the top of my lungs and fantasize about swinging from the chandeliers. If you don't like swinging or sitting near the chandeliers, there are other types of seating on the other side of the room. It could be at a couch, a table, or even a recliner of some sort. Whatever you feel like sitting in, it seems like this place has it all. 

It was lunch time so i wasn't too sure what i was in the mood for. The only thing i knew was that i was hungry. I wanted to eat, but just how much. Whenever i don't know what to get, i wait....i wait/research what others tried and wrote about or ask the server/bartender. My choices were between the turkey pastrami, shaved prime rib dip, or fried chicken.

It was a simple logical choice after questions were asked on how i wanted to feel after the meal. Did i want something light and refreshing or heavy food coma in the heat? the happy medium was the shaved prime rib dip. 

The shaved prime rib dip is something you have to come and try for yourself. The meat is tender and not dry. The bun is not on a typical french bread and not your typical dip sandwich. I guess maybe that's why the creators were cullinary dropouts. :) 

A delicious sandwich that i would probably try again if i am ever back in the area."}
{"text":"While on a girls' weekend trip, my four friends and I had a delicious lunch at Culinary Dropout. The ambiance was great and the food was to die for...I mean, really, really good. Then why am I only giving it one star? Because after we returned home fraudulent charges started to show up on the credit cards that we used there. Bummer. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for that."}
{"text":"I don't know how I didn't know about this place before.. This place is very big with indoor and outdoor seating.. They have happy hour Monday thru Friday 2-5... My friend and I ordered the Korean shrimp and chicken, pretzel
Fondue and pork belly nachos .. I got two beers and my friend had the sangria which all came out to be about $32.. They have few games outside like corn hole and ping pong .. We loved the atmosphere and the food was pretty good"}
{"text":"I really like culinary dropout. I've been to the Phoenix location several times and really like everything about it. This time in Tempe, I had a couple drinks (great), the wings (tremendous flavor) and the pretzels. The cheese sauce was as good as previous locations but the pretzels appear to have changed. The texture is more like rolls, more light and yeasty then pretzels should be. The shape is different as well, bigger, square shaped and less of a crust. They went from the best pretzels to below average. Please go back to the original."}
{"text":"Pretzels with cheese dip was great, beer selection above average. Great place to hang with a group. Had the fried chicken as well....not a big fan."}
{"text":"I definitely need to come back to try more items! This place is so delicious. Me and my friends ate here during work tour this year and my mind was blown. Based on my friends recommendation we ordered the pork nachos, the hummus, and the grilled cheese sliders. Honestly for the price it's a good amount of food that you get. The pork nachos are probably the best nachos I've ever had! The pork is so delicious in them and I'm not really a pork person usually. The only thing that I would change is to use real cheese instead of nacho cheese but most people prefer nacho cheese on nachos anyway

My friend ordered a garlic bread starter which was so delicious I was surprised how good bread could be LOL it definitely wasn't even that expensive maybe four or five dollars. The hummus was delicious too, as was the grilled cheese sliders which came with bacon and tomato plus fries!

Only complaint really was that the service was not the best. It was warped tour so it was a little busy but we sat at the bar and the bartender didn't tell us until we tried to get her attention that there were still people sitting there. So we moved farther down the bar where there was more space and she didn't get to us for probably around 15 minutes. The service wasn't that fantastic but being a server I understand that sometimes there are factors that I don't know about. She seem to be the only bartender at the time so I can't hold that against her too much."}
{"text":"Christmas Eve dinner out with family and friends. Evan, our server, had intimate knowledge of the menu and happily greeted us and made suggestions. The food (salmon, burgers, appetizers, Korean rib eye) were all cooked as we specified and were excellent. Changing up the combos a bit/different vegetables, etc. was no problem. Specialty cocktails (I loved the Room Service) were great as was the beer. The place has a hip vibe and there is plenty of room to roam, noise level moderate so you can visit. We are retirees who enjoy all age groups, and this restaurant is good for all. Ages of our party: 30-75. We live in Old Town but would happily make the short trek to Fashion Mall area to eat here again. Well done Culinary Dropout!"}
{"text":"This new place opened up recently with some good hype attached.  My friends and I decided to check this place out before the Prince concert at the Joint.  I'm certainly glad I did!

When you check into the hostess stand, you think this place is pretty small.  Don't be fooled by that.  It's HUGE inside.  A lot of seating inside and outside as well.  Huge bar area extending outside as well.  The outside area has a bunch of lounge tables.  Our table was half chairs and half booth.  Accommodated all people of my party.  Our server was nice, seemed a bit flustered as we did have a lot of questions and most of our drink requests were \"out of stock\" which didn't make too much sense.  

Their menu is not too pricey.  Things go for $15-$30 depending on what you want.  On top of that, they have an AWESOME secret menu given out on concert days.  Since the Prince concert was there, they offered it to us!  Super fast and easy, it's only $25 dollars and comes with 3 main components:  starter salad OR soft pretzel, meatloaf OR fried chicken and a bag beer.  GREAT DEAL, by the way.  I chose the salad which was light a refreshing.  Spring mix with balsamic vinaigrette.  For the main course I got the fried chicken.  You get various dark and white meat pieces.  They gave a ton of that!  It was accompanied with mashed potatoes and gravy, sauteed green beans and a biscuit.  The chicken was super juicy and crispy on the outside!  The gravy really made the mashed potatoes, which were also very creamy.  The beans were sauteed with bacon and had a nice, light salty taste.  The biscuit also was dense and flaky with creamy butter.  SOOOOO GOOD!!  The beer was a low end beer, always different.  I got the Milwaukee's best.  The thing that enhances the experience is the paper bag it comes in.  Super creative for higher end restaurant.  Shows the lighter side of \"Las Vegas strip\" type restaurant.  I REALLY liked that :)

Definitely will be back for another try.  I would like to try their fish and chips, Korean style ribeye cap and salmon.  So many yummy toppings!  If you're in the Hard Rock hotel, I highly recommend this place before a concert, show, or date night!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch with a group on a Thursday afternoon. The place was fairly empty at this time of day. I'd say the atmosphere is solid, very open, fun feel. We ordered a few drinks and had lunch. I had the seared tuna salad, which was delicious. I would highly recommend if you're looking for something on the lighter side. Cocktails were tasty but pricy. 
We hung around until HH started (3pm-6pm M-F) which included draft beers, house wine, and well drinks. There were also a few snacks on HH as well. 
I cannot comment on the nighttime atmosphere, but overall I'd say a great option for lunch and HH in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"If a restaurant could suffer from schizophrenia, Culinary Dropout would certainly get such a diagnosis. The service and food have both been inconsistent. The place holds itself out as a bar, but the game area is constantly overrun with children whose parents use the game as a substitute for watching their children.

The first time I went for brunch, the place was packed, but my friend and I were able to snag a seat at the bar. It took forever for the bartender to acknowledge us and get our drink order, and even longer to place a food order. The breakfast burrito I had was really good, especially the potatoes that came with it. My friend opted for the basic eggs, bacon, and toast breakfast. When her food came, she asked if they had any jam for the toast. The waiter said she wasn't sure and would check. How can you serve toast and not have jelly? Makes no sense. Fortunately, they did have some freshly made strawberry preserves that were really delicious. 

Drink prices are also pretty steep. $6.50 for a 16 oz for an Oskar Blues Pale Ale? I can go to Windsor and have a pitcher to myself for $7, and $5 if it's happy hour.

Had an early brunch a few weeks later and had no problem getting a table outside. I opted for the breakfast burrito again, but it wasn't as good this time. My boyfriend had the Captain Crunch Crusted French Toast, which sounded really good, but it was actually pretty bland. Our server was also just okay, which was disappointing because we were one of the only tables there.

My best experience was on a Thursday night. We got a great spot at one of the couches on the patio, and for the first time, I had great service here! Our waitress was awesome and never let our drinks get empty. She even put up with our drunken (annoying) party with a smile. And the Sweet Corn Cannelloni dish we ordered was excellent!

I came again yesterday for a late lunch. There was no problem getting a table, even though it was Memorial Day. Despite the fact that it wasn't that crowded, our waiter was pretty MIA. All of our drinks went empty at one point, and I would have definitely ordered another beer if he had bothered to ask. Thankfully, the food was excellent! We shared an order of grilled cheese sliders, and then I had the fried chicken because calories don't count on a 3-day weekend. My entree was amazing, and the portion was huge! I had a solid amount of food to take home for lunch today. My boyfriend said his double cheeseburger was great, evidenced by the fact that he didn't offer me a bite.

Although I enjoy gambling, I don't like to do it with my restaurant experiences. Until Culinary Dropout can become more of a sure bet, it won't be my first choice for dining in the area. 

P.S.:  The bathrooms are setup unisex style, so don't be alarmed if you enter the bathroom and find the opposite sex in there."}
{"text":"Went here with friends. Nice place and food. 

Tips: foreign ID such as Canada id (which usually can be accepted in several places) are not working here. So bring your US ID, if you don't have one, bring passport with you."}
{"text":"I would so much love to give this a top review, however they are severely understaffed. The food while pretty good and the drinks excellent. Either our server had to many tables or just couldn't keep up with the amount she had. While she was super nice and did her best it was like she was a bit overwhelmed.

The other downside was one of the sandwiches we order was supposed to not have Dijon on it and it came with it, 

There is a good side:

while I may really like mustard my daughter does not, we told her and she immediately she took care of it and she took the sandwich off of the bill and made it right. 

The cocktails are fantastic the old fashioned was nice just a bit too much water from the shaker, however it still was tasty I would order another.

I dug the environment it was super low key and a great place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Always love Culinary Dropout. Been here a handful of times but this was the first time that compelled me to write a review. Love the setting, music is fitting of the scene and I didn't feel like I had to talk over it while everyone working seems genuinely interested in making sure we were satisfied. What really stood out to me though was our server Nathan. He was on top of everything, very knowledgeable and personable while not overbearing. We were celebrating an occasion and weren't intent on mentioning it but it came up in conversation with him and he immediately recognized it and made sure we got everything to make the night special. I asked how long he had been there and was really surprised to hear he was new because I'd have guessed he'd been around awhile. If management sees this, seriously hold onto him because he was one of the best servers I've met throughout the valley and I would come back solely to have him as a server. Great style, good conversation, awesome recommendations. 10/10 for Nathan. Food was great but that's not all that makes an experience perfect. Thanks man."}
{"text":"On the outside, Culinary Dropout looks like it's going to be an All-American bar where  food and drinks shoot out from the back and the music blares in the front. It's not necessarily the opposite, but it's definitely an upper-scale version of what a good dinner restaurant should be. 

We came here with no expectations and left with full stomachs and smiles on our faces. We had the grilled artichoke (which had a great dipping sauce), cheese and prosciutto (plenty to share) for appetizers, and my friend got the Bistro Steak (on the small side but still filling) and I got the Jambalaya (spicy and full of sausage and seafood). 

We capped it off with a Monkey Bite, which is essentially a cinnamon roll crammed into a bed of baked apple and served with a scoop of ice cream. It was amazing. And delicious. And it was probably what put the restaurant over the top when it came to the food. 

Our server was attentive and didn't make things awkward. We didn't feel like we were being checked on every 2 minutes. 

Something to note is that the employees here don't have a uniform - they're free to dress in whatever way makes them feel comfortable. We used this as a conversation starter and learned a lot about our waiter. 

I'll definitely be coming back here again: Great service, good food, happy stomachs.

{"text":"I felt compelled to write about the excellent customer service at Culinary Dropout after my experience there. Major props to the manager, Joe for making sure we were taken care of the minute we arrived. The place was pretty crowded because it was during the popular \"Breakfast by the poolside\" hour, so no small tables were available. But instead of making us wait, Joe invited us to sit at one of the largest tables in the restaurant, and there were only two of us! Not only that, but he checked on us frequently to see if we needed anything. 

Needless to say, the food was tasty, the view by the pool is lovely, and it's just a cool laid back place overall to enjoy breakfast. I'd highly recommended swinging by."}
{"text":"Cool environment, solid food and nice beer selection.   Server was very nice but a little  slow.  I would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"First time here for a graduation party and had one of the rooms..awesome..the food, the service, the room it was all good.. We had the fried chicken, salmon, mashed potatoes..off the chain.  Looked at the rest of the bar area and wow.. so much space with ping pong tables..just a wonderful place to hangout and enjoy some good food and fun"}
{"text":"Now that we have finished eating, I can now write my review. We would definitely recommend this place to others, and would go back ourselves. Decor is upscale/modern; dress code is anywhere from jeans and a T-shirt to polos, button downs and slacks. Music is a bit on the loud side; so, if you're looking for an intimate, romantic setting, you might want to try this place at a different time. It is great, however, for meeting up with friends or bringing out of town visitors to...which is what we did. The food was quite delicious and creative. I had the salmon...was perfectly seared and paired with black rice; something I've never had before. My sister had the M.A.C. Burger, and said multiple times that it tasted just like a McDonalds Big Mac....only that the Culinary Dropout's burger blew McDonald's Big Mac out of the water. We had one issue with a meal, but they were quite apologetic and made it right. Oh, and their cocktails are awesome!! I had the Pomegranate Yuzu Mule...delicious! My husband had the After School Special; that's dangerous...tasted just like fruit punch. Anyway, definitely try this place out; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on a quiet Wednesday night. 
The good part's were that it is a very cool place to eat. There seems to be a lot gong on and it's very relaxed. The atmosphere was pretty good. The food was pretty good as well, I got the fried chicken. The sides were fantastic, the appetizer of pretzel bites was great as well. 


The only real disappointment with the food was I wasn't a huge fan of the fried chicken. It seemed almost sweet. But it was cook perfectly, just cause my palette didn't agree doesn't mean it's wrong. 

The big let down here was the service. We were in on a slow night, in a pretty slow section but service seemed disoriented almost. We sat down, got a menu, and our server walked away. After that she came back and asked if we wanted any appetizers, and we ordered and she walked away again for the second time without taking our drink orders. I had to ask for drinks when she came back with the appetizers. After the appetizers, she took our orders and we didn't see her again until entree's came out, and again I had to request another drink without being asked. 
I've worked in the service industry a number of years and it just was over all very underwhelming. THe service lacked attentiveness on a seemingly slow night."}
{"text":"Happy hour was the best time to visit here for our first time. Sweetest waitress Brittany very helpful . We had to try the pretzel fondue. There were enough for 4 people They were good but I did not go crazy about them like some people. Gotta try them though. Did not love the sangria.it was a fun idea to get the special double drink whatever it was called which was a beer of the day and a  shot. Take  what you get surprise! Korean chicken and shrimp skewer got raves Enjoyed the meatloaf sandwich All of this on the happy hour menu 3-6 M-F
It was an enjoyable night The bar is hugeLive music 3 pm 's / week
Had to try bourbon pie -chocolate lovers which was so delicious it is my favorite dessert ever
Will try entrees next time but there will definitely be a next time
Made reservations for Friday night
Hostesses and servers enthusiastic"}
{"text":"Poor service. My wife ordered a glass of wine to go with the meal, but despite asking several times and several different servers, it didn't arrive until after she had finished her meal. No real effort to apologize or accelerate the process...  Really spoiled the night out for us.

I had fish and chips. The fish was good, the chips kinda cold.
The squash pasta was just ok.

And just to add a little insult, we also received an email from Opentable stating that they had been notified by the restaurant that we were a no-show...  We had arrived just about 5 mins ahead of time. So not sure what that was all about....

So overall quite the disappointment

Update  5/7/2018

I received a quick response from the owners with an explanation. It`s good to see they really care. It seems like most of the reviews are very positive; so I hope our next visit will be as good as everyone else's.

The OpenTable issue must have been a mistake, and that was corrected.

  Thanks to the owners for caring."}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago with my gf and her parents. We started out with the pretzels and cheese and they were very good. The menu had so many things that I wanted to try but I ended up going with the fried chicken. It was seasoned well and tasted incredible. The service was good and the decor was nice. Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends were visiting from San Diego and decided to try this place on the recommendation of another friend. It was busy but we were able to find a place to sit at a fire pit and were able to get the full menu there. We ordered a few entrees and shared- as well and the pretzel bites and nachos. Everything was amazing except the nachos. They were just okay. We tried the fried chicken, butternut squash pasta dish and the kale salad with salmon. We liked everything equally. Fun atmosphere, and our server(can't recall his name) was great! If we come back to Phoenix we will for sure come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here, and probably the last. The Yard is a pretty cool place. They have complimentary valet, ping pong tables, corn hole, giant Jenga, all outdoors. It probably would have been more fun if I hadn't gone during the summer. It was way too hot. But the hummus and pita bread were good. Drinks were nice and cold. I can't really say much about the service since it was non-existent. Our waitress brought our drinks, took our order and never returned. We had to constantly ask other waitresses for refills. And every waiter/ waitress we asked seemed really annoyed. It was so frustrating. At least come and check up on us. We finally saw our waitress again when she brought our check. Not a single smile or \"have a goodnight.\" I don't know why we still tipped. Oh well."}
{"text":"Ate here approx 12:30 pm on Sat/23 Sep with 3 other friends:
- http://bit.ly/VNbbh6     $20.14 three-course lunch via Fall(?) Restaurant Week Fri/22 - Thu/28 Aug 2014. Culinary Dropout contributes $4 to a local charity.  
- I had: 1) Yesterday's Soup - seems similar to minestrone and I liked it since it was light. 2) Pub Burger - awesome. 3) Salted Caramel Custard - I'm not in to desert so I didn't care for the sweetness.
- 2 of my friends enjoyed their meals (the also opted for the $20.14 special).  The 3rd friend only ordered a chicken salad and though he enjoyed it, he said the price/portion size was more akin to a side salad than a large salad entree."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, very different. It was busy but the place was so big that we did not have to wait. Food was great. Pork belly nachos stood out on the appetizer menu, they were as good as they sound. The prime rib sandwich was also excellent. Highly recommended."}

{"text":"Culanary Dropout Tempe is one of FRC's crown jewels. Friend and I loved the open space atmosphere, a pleasing and unique counterpart to the space at NoRTH Italia over in Tucson (and many other Fox Restaurant Concepts). (We are huge FRC lovers!)

Great selection of local beers and the food was simply amazing. The happy hour meatloaf sandwich was quite delicious and the delicately roasted salmon was very very on point. If you're a grilled cheese fan, make sure to get the grilled cheese sliders! 

As expected, the service was prompt and very personable."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and what a great concept! 

First time there? Go for happy Hour and try a bit of everything! The prices are great and they offer great suggestions and sometimes bring out a sample for you to try. 

Best thing: Housemade Chips and Dip- get more than one as your group will be fighting for the last chips!

Meh: Grilled Cheese - I thought it would be a grilled cheese zhuzhed up a bit but no, very bland. 

Will we be back, absolutely as the drinks were all great! The Shandies are g"}
{"text":"I loved this place the second I walked in because of the atmosphere. Really cool vibe and very spacious. I came for a business lunch and we order the pretzels, brussel sprouts, deviled eggs and then I got the Gorgonzola chicken salad. All of them were amazing except I will say the deviled eggs were a little too salty for my taste. Would definitely come back though, I'm curious to try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! I go back time and time again because the food and drinks are incredible but the seating is great indoor and outdoor (nice and open), the staff is super friendly and I love that they have TVs everywhere to watch the games. Kudos to Culinary Dropout! This spot is awesome and I highly recommend them to Vegas visitors.

{"text":"Super fun place with a great energy. Would be an ideal destination if you were with a group of friends looking for somewhere to hang out. The inside is really loud but the outside \"the yard\" is sooo cute!

Nice lounge-y couches all over, different games to play, and on the Fri night we were there, there was a live band playing. 

Food was solid for a bar. Deviled eggs seasoned well (though the whites were rubbery), a lovely starter of strawberries and Brie (the strawberries were phenomenal!), pretzels with cheese fondue was nice...

For dinner we had the fried chicken which was ok but not great. The mashed potatoes and gravy was reminiscent of elementary school lunches (but in a good way!). 

Overall a really fun spot."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was TERRIBLE. I met my friend here for lunch and after the server asked if we needed a few minutes to review the menu and she didn't come back for 30 minutes. We placed our food order and my friend wanted to stay because she had had a drink and wanted to be sure she was okay to drive. After we we waited about 30 minutes we were essentially asked to leave. One of the reasons we were there so long was because our server ignored us for half an hour. The icing on the cake was when I was walking back to my car and one of the valet drivers almost hit me with a car. I'm never going back, which is unfortunate since some of their food is really good."}
{"text":"Loud.  Huge. Great salads. A bit for the younger food lol. 
However we were treated well and sat outside under a cover   
Could see the moon which was cool. 
\"Another Fox Concept\" same pretzels and dip. Yummy. 
Same Sauv Blanc 
Same, same, same. 
Consistent and good. My 20 something son would love this place. Big TVs. Beer pong. Lots of youngsters. 
I'd go back for the salad. All are good. Our table ordered 3/4 salads everyone liked what they ordered."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, these guys exceed culinary artist, Gordon Ramsey. With each bite I took, my taste buds were in ecstasy. Definitely somewhere to take your lady out for a nice treat."}
{"text":"Absolute TERRIBLE service. The bartenders are incredibly rude and charged me $24 for two lemon drops. If I ever go there again it will be for the games and NOT the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food! Upscale, american style. Live entertainment was really good too."}
{"text":"Had a good experience here when I came for a school fundraiser. Good service, nice atmosphere, delicious food and drinks."}
{"text":"We came in for the foot tapping, bob your head to the rhythm, Saturday night gospel blues. Bluesman Mike Anderson band was playing to a completely packed house. I walked up to the front of the bar just as a couple of gals were leaving and scored premium bar seats.

Time to get my drink on so I order up a Chimay Première (Red). A Trappist beer from a Monastery brewhouse in southern Hainaut, Belgium. $9. Poured from the bottle into a goblet shows a hazy, orangish amber. Taste is complex. There is vast malty sweet wandering all over but in balance. A world class beer.

Next cheese and meat for a little appetizer. I order up Humboldt Fog $6. An elegant, soft, surface ripened cheese. The texture is creamy and luscious with a subtle tangy flavor. Capicola $5. A delicious mild pork cold cut that comes with a few pieces of chewy Italian bread. No entrees tonight, just more beer. 

The designer in me was so impressed with the decor of this house because good design involves attention to even the smallest of details. There were so many strong patterns, colors, and textures. The stage is well done and the B&W photography from legendary musicians like the Boss are stunning. The energy in this house is very hip.

What a flat-out scorching date night."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a Dropout. I stopped in yesterday to visit with David Fox and see the new place. I have been looking forward for this venue to open for several months now. Right off the bat Props to Noel and Luke my servers. Two awesome young ones. 

So think of The Dropout and The Yard as a backyard, front porch and kitchen all rolled into one. This is Fox Restaurant Concepts' biggest project yet. It transformed an old motorcycle shop near 7th Street and Bethany Home into the most distinct restaurant. The property is just beautiful. A very large patio, or small park with various seating vignettes, including picnic tables and adirondack chairs. Lawn games for those devoted to ping pong, bocce ball and Pig in a Hole, all under a metal canopy.

Inside and outside there will be the two live music venues . If you have seen people like \"Blues Man Mike\" these shows are excellent. The little stage in the house is set in a wooden niche that provides an acoustic sound board. There are car bay doors for a great open air atmosphere.

The interior design has a western chic but modern ambiance and beautifully restored architecture. The bar is made of oak unstained but finished, a beautiful piece. The huge historic  Indian Motorcycle mural has been renovated and is a stunning piece of art. The kitchen is open and in view.

The beer on tap will range from $6 to $12. I'm looking forward to bellying up to the bar during an evening date to have a brew and laugh with my friends. Today I was allowed to try two drinks and they were superb. A crisp malt stella artois belgium brew and the second a mix called \"The After School\" Think Boilermaker. This drink was superb.

I was very fortunate to have the kitchen make a little dinner for me while I was speaking to Jason the very cool as hell manager. They cooked me up a pound of  French steamed mussels with garlic, white wine, butter and little bites of sausage to spice up the broth. Came with toast. So Good.

And thank you for the culinary dropout, beer can sleeve, stealthy yet stylish.

Grand Opening is Monday 2/11/13"}
{"text":"So can I please take a moment to rave about how fabulous the staff and management are here?!?!

When Manager Haley and Chef Raymond found out that I had been unable to try their ribs during my first visit, they invited me back to the restaurant so that I could get the entree that I had been reading about on yelp. I accepted their invitation and was amazed at the level of service I received during my return visit. 

Sam (I think she's a manager) already knew I was coming and communicated with the very nice server (I AM SO SORRY I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME!!) that I was back to try the ribs. My friends and I indulged in the house chips and French Onion Dip, prosciutto deviled eggs, and grilled cheese sliders.. They're all so excellent, it's really hard to pick a favorite. 

Then the ribs came out...personally...by the EXECUTIVE CHEF!!!  Seriously made me feel like a VIP. Needless to say, the ribs were amazing, even better than I thought they would be! 

This review was to acknowledge the hospitality and high level of service of Culinary Dropout's team. Their food is amazing, the ambiance is relaxing and interesting...but seriously, the service is exceptional."}
{"text":"First time at Culinary Dropout, went to Scottsdale location.  Loved it!!   Cool atmosphere, food was delicious, and wait staff was prompt and very friendly.  If any criticism, the food came out too quick; still working on salads.  And as a plus, they have live music on weekends.  I'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"After a Saturday of late night partying, I would totally recommend this place for hangover recovery. The Sunday lunch crowd comes in there causal hip clothes. Great place for drinks and food. Portion size are small. The mall is across the street for shopping before or after eating."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really cute and the Devils eggs are delicious and only $3. Granted you only get 3 halves but it's worth it.
What's not worth it is the cheese and pretzel fondue. I swear I liked it the last time I was here (which was probably 2 years ago) but it was more just a filler and nothing special. 
I ordered the kale and strawberry salad with chicken. It was good but I'm not going to be craving it again anytime soon. That's probably why it took me 2 years to go back. It's definitely cute inside though so worth checking out for at least a drink if you've never been there."}
{"text":"The best kept secret off the strip! Creative cocktails, menu and superb service...such a great spot! Perfect way to end my NYE weekend in LV!"}
{"text":"Happy to have the GM call and correct our experience.  Sadly our night cant be redone but hopefully our experience will lead to a better experience for others!!!  Thank you for being in tune to issues!"}
{"text":"Very satisfactory dining experience. Loved the ambience.. Very hip and trendy. All the servers were polite and courteous hipsters. Fantastic selection of craft beers. Menu offered a plethora of new American cuisine. I indulged in the Black Mussels steamed in Stella Artois. This paired well with an IPA. Service could have been a little quicker, but besides that.. No complaints from me. Being close to ASU, I would have expected more raucous students. It was a very balanced crowd though. Young professionals, married couples with children, and students all mingled and enjoyed the good food. I highly recommend Culinary Dropout to anyone looking for a laid back night out on the town!"}
{"text":"Has a far more sophisticated ambience than its Tempe counterpart. The crowd is much more mature.. You see couples and families side by side with hipster students.
Surprised with live music. Really cool outdoor area. Last time I had mussels but this time I sampled the delicious soft pretzel rolls with cheese dip and the salmon bruschetta! I have to recommend the Deschutes IPA, very hoppy and tasty. Parking is less convenient than at Tempe, but they do offer complimentary valet parking if you so wish. This is a great Phoenix spot for drinks and some good bar food."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is clean, brick meets industrial/ rustic. .  Now, the food was delicious with samples of what they are great at preparing. Here celebrating my husbands business. Very impressed and will be back."}
{"text":"I took my kids and it was absolutely delicious along with great service. We were seated right away and had water at our table before we could ask. Two of my kids ate the Pub burger, my daughter had the ravioli and I had the ribs. We ate  all the food and left beyond full. We went on a Saturday night and I would suggest making a reservation (we did)a couple days in advance. Its a popular place and I now understand why."}
{"text":"A pretty cool concept! The atmosphere is fun with a nice mixed crowd, all in all a great place gather and the food was great!!!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to have a 6 hour layover in Vegas. Decided to come to Hard Rock, grab a quick bite and gamble a little. It was 2:30 on a Tuesday and besides three other tables this place was empty.  I even left my phone to charge on the other side of the restaurant because it was so quiet. We ordered a burger and chicken wings. Besides talking to the hostess and waitress about our time limit and plans it took 35 minutes for the food. Pretty unacceptable. The burger was delicious but the chicken wings were disappointing. Dosing buffalo sauce on them does not make hot wings. Overall I'm really bummed, our quick bite on a Tuesday afternoon (after lunch rush hour) should not have taken over an hour."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday night at around 7pm without a reservation. Luckily, there was a party who didn't show up so we took their table and didn't have to wait.

CHARCUTERIE (varies) - We got the capicola ($5), salami Toscana ($5), manchego ($4), and crescenza ($4). I loved the truffle flavor from the crescenza and all the meats went along great with the cheeses. It was also a lot more filling than it looked. 4/5

BLACK MUSSELS ($13) - The mussels were a little smaller but the soup more than made up for it. It was so good to drink and it was great to soak the grilled bread in it to get all that flavor. 4/5

FRIED CHICKEN ($17) - This was probably one of the best fried chickens I've ever had. It was crispy and tender and had a bit of sweetness from the honey. We were splitting the fried chicken and we still got a full order each of the mashed potatoes, cole slaw, and biscuit. Definitely would recommend. 5/5"}
{"text":"I went to this location on a Tuesday night and it was fairly busy. We decided to seat ourselves outside, and that was pretty quick and easy. However, waitstaff isn't very attentive and we waited a long time to get orders, and then an even longer time for drinks. I wouldn't go back because the food wasn't to die for either."}
{"text":"Well. This was somewhat of a disappointment. I feel this place is really overrated for what they offer. And their prices are pretty outrageous. Yes, I know it's the strip. I know that is what is expected. Does it make it worth it? No. 

We ordered drinks, appetizers and two main dishes. $160. 

The drinks were good. The food was good, but not extraordinary. That's my main problem with a lot of these joints on the strip. It's so hard to justify the price. Although, I'm always willing to try new places, I leave feeling disappointed or jipped. 
The service was good, but it was very slow. We didn't get checked on much, and it took forever to get our check, and another 20 minutes just for the server to come back to run them. 

If you're wanting to come here, just know that it is a bit more pricey. Especially the drinks."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!!! Loved the decor and how spacey it was. Such great vibes. We got the cheese board and sandwiches and I'm bummed I don't live here so I can't come back next weekend. Would love to just drink and eat there all day! Would recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"The decor and whole ambiance of this place is dope-- I love how upscale and casual this place is all at once. I have been here in Tempe and also in Phoenix and both have their own unique vibes. They seem like awesome places to go out and drink although I've never been. Food is funky but nothing super special and you definitely pay for the experience. I had the steak sandwich and it was bomb. Would recommend!

Update after eating here: 
- steak sandwich is YUMMY I would eat this as a guilty pleasure lunch all the time if I had the chance. 

- potato chips w dip were tasty-  nothing super unique though. 

- Cesar salad w shrimp is delish"}
{"text":"Food was great, wait-staff were awesome!!  Great way to people watch, as it was definitely a diverse group.  It was packed the minute we got there at like 4pm and stayed that way all night.  Super fun, would totally go back."}
{"text":"Company outing, food was good, drinks kind of pricey after I started a tab. My company covered the first two drinks."}
{"text":"Best Sunday specials ever. Pork belly nachos are so good, and the turkey pastrami on a pretzel bun is a must."}
{"text":"Just brutal. They have a mandatory policy that waiting list has a 10+ minute wait to sit down. We came in as a party of five and they told us 90 minute wait and we waited over 20 minutes and 6 tables were completely empty. We complained to the hostesses and manager and they didn't care at all. Props to the servers we talked to as they were very annoyed they had empty tables when it was obvious there was people waiting."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere here and I really like that the servers can wear their own clothes. Super hipster little place with a big \"backyard\" that has ping pong tables and corn hole. Great drinks. Delicious pretzels and fried chicken  would recommend people come check it out. When I was there Saturday night it was so easy to find parking, but Wednesday was jam-packed! Will absolutely be coming back."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Scottsdale location but came to the Tempe location for a birthday party. The wait for a table was reasonable and we had a few cocktails at the bar while we waited. After we got sat, our server Kobe made the experience incredible!! The place was packed but our drinks were never empty and he make the best recommendations. He also helped me choose items off the menu to accommodate for my allergy and was attentive to the group at all times. I definitely will be visiting this location a lot more and would love to bring in coworkers for business meetings in the future!! (Kobe's eyes are beautiful you can't miss him!!!)"}
{"text":"Live music, game room, fantastic bar and great food. We love the vibe and energy of this restaurant. Great bartender- Shae --awesome drinks and knowledgeable about his menu and bar back Ryan B. ---this guy never stopped and so friendly. We ordered the pretzel fondu--yummm, turkey pastrami sandwich, delicious, and brussel sprouts ---- my favorite. Will be back when we come back to spring training!!!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Well decorated. Extremely creative drink menu and reasonably priced too. The nachos were decent- the chips are thick but the toppings were sparse. The steak and fries were very good. Good spot for group dinners"}
{"text":"OMG, this place was amazing! At first, we hesitated about going because we didn't see a kids' menu on the website but we decided to try it anyway. So glad we did! The restaurant did have kids opinions that weren't on the menu and my boys' loved them (chicken tenders and cheeseburger). My husband and I had sandwiches (Turkey Rueben & Prime Rib dip)....AMAZING! The atmosphere was great, too! We watched the Western Finals and my son (age 7) met some other Rockets fans (not age 7)! Good time had by all!"}
{"text":"Well was hoping it was a fluke but server just cleaned our table from everyone eating and I tried to order and she walked off with the dirty plates and never came back, hmmm"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and bartenders. Little too loud though due reverb in building and amount of patrons at time. Was packed on a Tuesday night..."}
{"text":"Had a drink at the bar before dinner, Nice looking room they did a good job with patio. Food was average at best. 
Everything was prepared just ok. The service was attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"Meh.

I came here because a guy from church said it's one of his favorites and he loves the pretzel fondue. To be fair, the pretzel fondue was really good. Everything else was not. I tried the kale salad and added chicken. The whole thing tasted like smoked bacon although there was no bacon. It was so gross. They let me order something else, so I ordered the chicken salad. I'm not that hard to please and like chicken salad almost anywhere. Nope. It was way too saucy, did not cling together at all, and the sauce just tasted bad. Terribly disappointing. My husband got the meatloaf which was alright. Everything was WAY overpriced. The only good things were the service and the pretzel fondue. This place must be for tourists. Yuck."}
{"text":"I had the burger from here and I must say it was one of the best gourmet burgers i've ever had. Good flavor. Had a good crust on it, but not burnt. I also had the biscuits and gravy a couple of days later for lunch. Everything I ate was awesome. Very reasonable prices to. Staff friendly as ever."}
{"text":"If you like $4.00 Pepsi, self serve, loud children and inconsistent food offerings, then you'll love this place. Need I say more? I'm not wasting anymore of my time on this place. Or anymore money."}
{"text":"Not all the dropouts have the same layout but the one in Scottsdale provide the best opportunity for a party of 12 to quickly reunite & get a chance to play catch up. 

They do have a kids menu but it's not a hard copy... just ask your server and they'll be able to tell you all the items ranging from a hamburger cheeseburger grilled cheese and I believe two other items.

We had a party of 12 and they were very accommodating as I made the reservation online the night before.

The food was great, somebody had the ribs and we decided to share with others. I had the Korean style ribeye cap (pricey but good) over a bed of vegetables along with the deviled eggs (always on point) and we also got a few salads with fish.

The staff always works as a team so if you need something you can ask any of the servers with ease (if you can figure out who is actually a server as they are dressed in casual clothing).

Not as vibrant as the Tempe location as they don't have an entertainment area (ping pong, corn-hole, foosball) but it's really all about the social aspect and getting together with friends."}
{"text":"Holy Moly! We had the Bistro Steak last night and it was the best piece of meat I've ever tasted. I love this place! I love it so much, it's where I'd like to plan my wedding. The patio is fantastic as well as inside. The staff is great and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"Top notch food at a reasonable price. A meal I won't soon forget!

Edit: don't get the ramen. It's more of a seafood chicken noodle soup. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"We ate at Culinary Dropout on Saturday for lunch. We were seated outside at a large comfortable table which was nice. We were told their Pub Burger was the best so all of us ordered that as our dish. The burger was good, not the best I have had. It comes with Havarti cheese, bacon and BBQ sauce. Two of the burgers were not cooked right so we had to send them back to re-cook which was disappointing. The service was great; our waiter was really cool about re-cooking the burgers and was very attentive to our needs. It's a little bit on the pricey side, $15 for a burger is high in my opinion. It's a great place if you are looking for bar food and convenience if you are staying at Hard Rock hotel."}
{"text":"Been hearing good things about CD recently so I finally stopped in with a group of people for dinner.  Apparently, several in the group hadn't heard of CD and were putting me under the gun for my recommendation...in the end everyone gave me props.

We started with some antipasti which was all very good and if that's your thing I would recommend giving a meat, a cheese, olives, and tomatoes a whirl.  But at the very least, get yourself some of the 'crusty bread and good olive oil'  The bread was awesome and the olive oil was even better, I'd get it every time.

So many of the items on the menu sound good it was tough to decide.  The overwhelming favorite order was the Turkey Pastrami...how can you go wrong with a pretzel bun?  I was fortunate enough to convince a friend to go halfsies on the Turkey Pastrami and the Shaved Prime Rib dip.  We both agree the dip was phenom and the better of the two choice.

They have a pretty solid selection of beers and actually offer a cool deal where for $2.95 you can get a cheap as hell beer in a brown bag.  The beer was sort of a mystery and I think it changes every so often...it would even be better if it changed order to order.  This go around it was a 'Buck Range Light'.  I had never heard of it but someone at the table had.

The waiter mentioned they have some nice specials certain nights.  I think on some Sunday's they do $3 Jameson drinks and $1 oysters if you're into that.

The only thing keeping Culinary Dropout from a 5 star rating (in my opinion...obviously) are the portions.  For the prices we paid for a sandwich, I thought they could have been a little bigger.  The shave prime rib dip was amazing, but the given the size i could have had 1.5-2 easily.  For an $18 sandwich I'd hope to at least have to put up a fight to finish or feel full afterwards.  That's my only warning, otherwise, it's a pretty cool and delicious place to grab a meal.  They even feature outdoor seating for days when it isn't 115 degrees."}
{"text":"Best bar in tempe, pregame spot is perfect. The drinks are great, the atmosphere is so legit. They have cornhole, ping pong and shuffleboard. This is just. Great place to enjoy yourself and watch the game. The food is so hit or miss. The chicken wings are to die for. Do NOT get the pretzels and fondue, whoever says to get them is an idiot. First off the pretzels are kind of firm, like scones. Then the cheese isnt even melted, its kind of similar to velveeta cheese. So thats trash so dont get that. The salads look bomb, i highly recommened this place"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want comfort food. Fun menu and cool decor.  This place definitely has the South Scottsdale vibe going on here. However, I went in the afternoon and there were a couple of tables seated with kids and strollers. So, I think this place is pretty accommodating to all."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service with memorable menu twists

Took my wife and kids to CD for pre-Mother's Day.  It proved to be a great choice.  The soft pretzel balls and cheese fondue was a fun, new dish to start things off.  Next was a mix of cheeses, meats, and olives chosen on a sushi-style card.  Entrees of Korean-style steak, garden salad, and grilled cheese sandwich with bacon made everyone happy.  And the monkey break dessert left us cooing before we waddled out the door.  

Service was excellent from Caitlin.  The rest of the service crew reminded me of the cast of Beverly Hills 90210... without the token minority.  And as the father of two little girls, the tight pants one of the service gals was wearing made we want to buy a remote island to shelter them.

Still, the experience was superb.  The pretzel balls with fondue and the Korean-stlye steak were especially memorable.  (My wonderful wife ate a third after I shared some.  Yes, I was sad.  But, I'm a giver.)

Highly recommended and we will be back..."}
{"text":"We went to see Rob Thomas and Adam Lambert ( They were superb!) at the Joint, so after will call duties we decided to get dinner. Decided on trying this place , it was a wise choice. First of all the waiter was the bomb, Adorably cute with blue hair and tattoos , huge smiles friendly and attentive. Took the time to explain everything and gave refills or anything we needed in a timely manner. So the service was golden for that it would be five stars.
 He suggested the pretzels with fondue, carbs are my enemy so we said no... which we regretted later as everyone else ordered them and they looked really good. 
ordered: ( We mixed it up and shared so we can check it all out)
Side salad , tasted a little funny to me, it was ok.
Chicken noodle soup, had an Asian flair to it. Very unique and not too salty.
Fried Chicken comes with mashed, Cole slaw, biscuit . Chicken was super tender.
Steak with brussels sprouts potato and mushrooms. The brussels sprouts were so good we ordered extra~!
 Didn't have room or time for dessert.
A 4 star because soup and or salad should have been included in the price for dinner... But hey I am cheap...;)
 A good choice if in the Hard Rock Casino."}
{"text":"You don't find a place like this everyday; great atmosphere, over the top service, incredible drinks and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Do not come here on a weekend to eat if you want to spend less than two hours for your food."}
{"text":"Ann Marie is the best waitress! She is so outgoing and will get you to order more drinks than you planned. We liked them all. The salmon is delicious. The restaurant is tucked away- what a shame, but the decor is really nice. We loved the outdoor eating area with the live music. It's too bad you can't walk out to the sand bar area to drink!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty much on the fence about this place. If I was just rating my food I'd def go with  4. My fried chicken was delicious. I was marinated overnight fried to perfection and drizzled with honey.  They gave me 3 generous pieces and some delicious mash potatoes and gravy. Good fried chicken that meets my Louisiana standards is hard to find in Phoenix, but this was really good in a different kind of way, the seasoning was light but it worked with the dish.

I gave the place a three because of the \"vibe\". The service is kinda weird.  I don't really even remember my waiter....no one was in uniform and it was hard to tell who worked there....I'm pretty sure they were trying hard for that laid back everybody's welcome kinda vibe...Def a surprise for the location. 

Anyway, I went for lunch and it was pretty empty so I'm def curious of how  my experience would be on a Friday night."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! There is not enough space to type all the great things to say about this great restaurant?! Food was great, fresh and didn't? take long to get our order. We were very pleased with the service and the place is very large! When we get back to AZ we will be here again!"}
{"text":"Great place awesome atmosphere great food great drinks definitely a must do it's like partying in someone's backyard in the back with all the games ping pong tables pool table or you can go inside and just chill"}
{"text":"So let's start with the service, our server was on point. So was the rest of the staff. Outstanding, they really work as a team. Let's get that clear. They even helped us celebrate our co-workers birthday (of course). 

However, the food was meh. We had a large group, and our menu was a select few items (our request to help keep it simple). Sandwiches or Salads were our choices. I decide to get one of the salads. Honestly, I can't even remember it. The flavor, well, that's what I think was missing. 

The apps were tasty (bread to dip in melted cheese is always a winner) and the desserts were too (banana cream pie). 

I really want to give this place another try, because I see the potential. So, you'll have to check back with me once that happens. In the mean time, it was just A-OK."}
{"text":"Solid feature and worth a visit, especially for Happy Hour (see my pic) . This was my 2nd visit to Culinary Dropout during one of my trips to Vegas. The pretzel/fondue app is worth the trip alone. Between the two visits, I've had the fondue both times. I've also had the wings & monkey bread, both quite good. If you want some really satisfying fare, CD is a high recommend for being dependable and delicious, mix in great service and a cool environment & there's that!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness gracious!!! We went to try their pretzels and Bloody Mary and man were they delicious! We also had the salmon bruschetta and belly pork nachos! The salmon bruschetta was Freaken delicious! Belly pork nachos were good, not great. The meat was kind of sweet but the fresh guacamole made it balance!!! The service was awesome! The guy serving is had a trainee, I see why. He was attentive, funny and had great menu suggestions! It's a fancy shmancy environment but we did not feel out of place! Overall great Experience!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a night and met a friend here. Quite an atmosphere the owners and staff have created. Very vibey and open, with ample space and seating variety- whether you're in the mood for a more formal inside experience, bar or patio. Staff is friendly and casual, and the food is great. Several options across the board for whatever you feel like. Particularly enjoyed the small plates and antipasto menu. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here with 4 of us and the experience overall was solid. I really like the look and feel of the place. The hosts and server was very friendly. I really like the patio and decor inside. The food overall was good. The Korean ribeye cap was delicious, but the ribs were pretty basic. The sandwiches and salads that we ordered we're pretty decent, but nothing special. I would come back."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Loved the live music. Come hungry and order an app, entree and dessert! I recommend the pretzel bites and the shaved sandwich."}
{"text":"Haven't tried their food, but they sure do make a good Mojito! The Mojito is so tasty! Some drinks are too bubbly, too watered down, but not this one! Its sweet, minty, and the way I like it! 

The ambiance is also very trendy. They've got a live band, and when the band isn't playing they play the music I listen to on Pandora! The only draw back is that it is very loud. You see people here from 20s-30s dressed up. It's almost like a club without the dancing. You stare up at the ceiling and you see huge chandeliers hanging down. Another very photo-esque place!"}
{"text":"Wow! Let me just say this place is AWESOME! Great service, everyone who works here are smiling and look genuinely happy. The ambiance is quiet relaxing. Everyone is dressed so cute and the decor is nice. My mom and I came from out of town and happened to walk in during happy hour. The menu for happy hour is so good! Try the chopped salad and the Korean shrimp and chicken. Also, the chips and the dip that comes with it, just wow. Our water as Haley was so sweet and so accommodating. She knew we were out of town and took the time to suggest and write out things places to eat! This was the first place that had a lot of gluten free and dairy free options, and nothing I ate hurt my stomach or made me I'll. I defiantly think you will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Being from out of town, we came here on the recommendation of a person I met golfing.  The Pretzel Fondue was fantastic and worth the visit alone.  The beer list was impressive as well.  Our waitress was good and the staff that we interacted were all very friendly and helpful.

The Fried Chicken was good, however the breast was pretty dry.  The thigh and drumstick were juicy and the seasoning was good."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! Grilled cheese sliders, fries, pretzel fondue, and onion dip are all amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for a work mixer and had the pork belly nachos.  TO DIE FOR!!!  Hands down the best I've ever had!  Was also here a few weeks ago for a business lunch and had the grilled chicken club sandwich.  Also amazing!  Fun atmosphere.  My kids had a blast playing cornhole with my coworkers tonight.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great freshly made drinks and an awesome happy hour beers on tap for days service can be slow and make sure to asked for double ketchup they tend to be stingy love music and complementary valet $$ prince range but staff is fun (and good looking) easy going crowed of all ages games such as ping pig corn hole darts as well as an outside  bar my staple go to   Personal favorites are the grilled cheese sliders pretzel fondue and the cheddar perogies a great snack are the Brussels sprouts check this place out"}
{"text":"Every now and again there's a restaurant I'll visit which feels like they deserve way more than 5 stars, this is one of them let me explain why. First off I chose this place for it's vibe, food and great reviews which I'd seen on Yelp. A lot of people mentioned Happy hour so we definitely wanted to check that out. I was under the impression HH was til 6pm but once we arrived I learned we only had 3 min left because it is actually from 2-5pm. Well, our greeter told us she'd send our server right over and he did arrive quickly so we placed our order for a few things that caught our eye right away: grilled cheese sliders, pretzel and cheese fondue and chips with onion dip, a beer and a glass of sangria. Later we also added their wings which were absolutely fantastic btw. We get our drinks and my GF loves her beer that our server mentioned she might like based on her tastes & I loved my sangria! We are just engaged in conversation enjoying this beautiful place, the light is so great, we loved all the games they have on the outside part and all the couches, just everything about it is awesome. We asked the hostess when she passed by about the availability for some of the rooms where they hold events and she gave us a ton of information and feedback as well as cards on whom to contact regarding holding an event there. It's so awesome when an employee can share more information about a place they work in even if it has nothing to do with their exact job description. I don't remember her name but thought, wow, she genuinely seems very happy to work here and after looking around we realized pretty much everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there. Our server was great as well, super attentive and helpful with any questions we had at any point. Our food was ridiculous. Let me explain, it's a small-ish menu but these are THE BEST PRETZELS & cheese ever! Just get them already and say hello to carbs, it's so worth it! The cheese sauce was something else too, it consistently stayed warm and creamy over fire (the way it's brought out to your table), a great touch! Chips and dip was fantastic and the grilled cheese sliders were good but I kinda wished they had tomato as well. You might be thinking we ordered too many things with cheese and sauce, well I don't eat meat so other than a salad I didn't have a lot of options. I will still come back, granted if you're a vegan or vegetarian you may have a hard time finding something but the drinks, service, vibe are worth it. We are definitely coming back with friends and family and will reach out for more info on hosting an event there. What a beautiful place. Can't wait to go back and listen to some live music next time."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were fantastic. Only giving it 4 stars because it's not the best place to watch a game. While they have a ton of TVs, they're all facing one way or the opposite. So if you're sitting to the left or right, you can't see the game very well."}
{"text":"My wife and I happen to be in Tempe and without kids. Since the Cosmos aligned, thought we would try a place that doesn't have a slide or play place attached to it..
Culinary Dropout sort of hard to find yet well worth the hunt!  
After walking down a long, cement hallway, it opens up to an airy, hipster yet welcoming main area. 
We were quickly seated and quickly attended to. 
The food consisted of a variety of burgers etc with some culinary twists. We shared the roast beef dip and also had the pretzel bites to go.
Fantastic meal and the bites w/the cheese sauce are dangerously good.
Good craft beer selection of local favorites along with some non-local goodies. 
The server did give me the wrong beer yet I did not complain...it's beer!
All in all, great place to dine and if the Cosmos aligns again (or we get a sitter), we will head to Culinary Dropout!!"}
{"text":"So to be fair the five star rating is just for the banana cream pie. I've not eaten dinner here but come in just for the BCP.  I've tried it at other places from cheap eats to high end steak houses and this is the best BCP by far. You can tell it is fresh and it melts in your mouth. It sits on salted caramel with a light banana whip cream on top. It's worth stopping in for."}
{"text":"**copied from an accidental duplicate account** Came in around 12:30 on a Sunday to check out their brunch menu.

Staff was all really helpful and it was nice to talk to people around my age. They're also all attractive and dressed cool since it's hard rock after all.

Got the signature old fashioned and while a little on the sweet side it was still really good!

Got the turkey ruben and holy hell it was so good and I dont even consider myself a ruben girl. That pretzel bun pushes it to the top! I also got the perogi and it was a really interesting take on traditional perogi. They were really great too!

Overall I'm sad I was too stuffed to try the monkey bread but I'll be back here for sure!! Maybe tomorrow :D"}
{"text":"We like this place better than the one in central Phoenix because the bartenders were attentive and nice; we always found parking; and it's not crowded. We used to eat at CDO in Scottsdale before they open one in Phoenix. Back then the food was good but now it's subpar. It's equivalent to bar food."}
{"text":"Great place!  Very unique and cool atmosphere, great service, and the food is outstanding.   The closest thing to my mom's meatloaf that I've found. (that's a good thing)"}
{"text":"Went there for a company dinner with 8 people. As we were being seating the hostess said enjoy your meal, you need to leave by 7:45. First time I have ever been told I had to leave a restaurant after a couple of hours. I get you want to turn tables, but this was a Thursday night, not really crowded. We are going to put the word to our company, there are plenty of places that will be happy to have one of the largest employers in the Valley. Btw, other tables were \"allowed\" to stay beyond the 2 hours we were allowed.
Mike"}
{"text":"OK, I'm crazy about this place on so many levels. Mostly because I'm in Tempe for my accepted daughter to audition ASU as a possible college for next year. Everything about this place says \"FUN party!\" It was a nice precursor for her and helped her (I think) to choose a slightly more academically minded community! Most likely NOT Arizona State. Thank you Culinary Dropout! In addition...this place is awesome! We loved the food! Of course we started with the famous pretzel pieces with the cheese dip...and it's as good as everyone says. Of course it's filling so we settled on salads as entree's and she had the shrimp Ceasar salad and I had the Italian chopped salad...both incredible. The place itself is amazing...with a huge outdoor \"party room\" filled with sofas and games and a really unusual vibe that would guarantee a fun group night. I love this place....and I hope I come back here. IF my daughters team has a road trip!"}
{"text":"The pretzel with cheese fondue app and chips and dip were to die for! Wish they still had the grilled cheese sliders, but the fish and chips were very tasty.  James was so sweet and knew exactly what was best! Cheers to you James!"}
{"text":"No wonder it's called culinary \"dropout\". You will want only culinary graduates after dining here. Service was terrible and food left me unimpressed. Took 30 minutes to get a yogurt parfait, broccoli cheddar, and a breakfast burrito to the table in a half empty restaurant. 0/10 do not recommend"}
{"text":"SOO GOOD!! This food is amazing. We ordered the truffle chips and they were perfect.  We actually ordered a side salad with chicken and it was HUGE! Veggies were fresh and chicken was perfectly cooked.  Our waitress was a doll.  Ok, now don't get scared-- I found a little hair in my chicken. I was totally grossed out and gave my salad back.  My sister got the same one and found nothing and it was totally fine. The waitress who was so kind and friendly brought me back a brand new salad with chicken and I finished the entire thing and it was lovely.  The ambiance was super cool and trendy we ate outside in December. They had heaters outside, which was nice.  TVs and live music, cushioned seats outside."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I had the avocado toast and my mom had a salad. The service, however, was subpar. Our waiter didn't bring us sugar or water when we asked for it. He never really checked in on us to see if we needed anything else. Good food, but definitely disappointed about the service."}
{"text":"Went last night. I can't say enough about the experience. Our waiter was beyond exceptional and the food reminded me of some of my favorite Portland spots. I'm always looking for that quality. 

The pierogies were so similar to a taste of home, my great grandmother taught me to make them and these guys were so similar I could have cried. But of course they took a more developed approach and I can't say it was disappointing. The Brussels chips were crispy and the touch of bitterness married so well with the touch of sour from the creme fraiche and the sweetness of the potatoes. Clearly working out that umami touching on all notes in one dish. I would recommend it to anyone with and open mind to developed flavors and a love of the old world dish.

Matthew had the shaved prime rib sandwich as suggested with onions and mushrooms by our waiter which came with fries.  I don't think I've ever seen him eat so quickly. The cheese was melted to perfection and the meat was rich and each bite was like butter. Along with the fries Matthew requested a side of ranch which was thick and rich with herb flavors. I could speak volumes on this condiment alone.

But what struck us more were the employees. Particularly our waiter, I feel so upset that I did not memorize his name, he is a gem in a world of dying customer service. (Longer brown hair, in a low bun, approximately 6'1\" if not a bit taller, and last night(3/8/17)wearing dark jeans and a red plaid flannel) the food was impeccable but his service is what will bring us back. We had our one year old son with us, who is getting over a cold and was being a moderate terror. Our waiter was so patient with Laige and understanding of his disheveled looking parents. He was there when we needed him without being a bother and he engaged in conversation with me that let me relax and feel not so awful for not having my child under complete control.

We have been living in the Phoenix/Tempe area since September and this was the first dining experience that left us feeling humbled and more than content. And we sincerely cannot say thank you enough for the service and food we received.

Of course Laige's favorite part as well as what set me back as a mother was walking out and stopping at the window to the kitchen to show Laige all the people working steady and hard on the line that provided us the food just to wave and show appreciation and I kid you not. Everyone in that kitchen took a moment and looked up and either smiled or waived at my son. This place is doing it right, putting community back into food. We loved every bit of this experience. Thank you all so much, front and back of the house alike!"}
{"text":"Pretzels are great!  Apples go great with the fondue as well.  But LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the house chips and onion dip."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, and the fried chicken is one of my favorites, along with the pretzel appetizer. It's also in old town and in the mall and parking is easy to find if you are willing to use the parking lot near the place. Now the reason this place does not get 5 stars is because the service is awful here usually. The hostesses seem to think that they are doing you a favor by doing their jobs, and the food takes forever after you order... But hey have a few drinks and enjoy the wait and do some people watching while you are at it."}
{"text":"NOT a fan of forced valet parking, when there is a giant lot adjacent to the business. (Do yourself a favor and street park instead of pulling in the lot).

Expected Excellent Culinary Dropout food, service, and experience (games: cornhole, table tennis, etc).

The go-to app for our table was the pretzel balls and molten cheese. I had a two egg breakfast which was satisfying. My friend ordered the french toast, and it looked great (I wasn't invited to sample! Haha)."}
{"text":"I figured it was time to check this place out, it was a waste of my time and money. Service HORRIBLE, food absolutely not anything special. That about sums it up zero substance in every way."}
{"text":"This is literally always a favorite -- the pretzel with provolone fondue is LIFE. I usually default to the burger but love so much on the menu"}
{"text":"I went here twice while I was in Vegas. I had lunch here after checking into my room and loved what I had. Then I had breakfast here before checking out and I had to send my cold food back. I ordered the biscuits and gravy . I've had better. Lunch was great but breakfast wasn't anything to go back for. The place is really laid back and has a great view of the pool."}
{"text":"Ok, first of all, make sure you order your monkey bread 15-20 min before you consume. You're going to want to do it though because it is delicious. Second of all, be wary of the bathrooms because they're kind of confusing. All I'm saying is, you don't want to be buzzed and have to go to the bathroom because you'll most likely go in through the wrong door. And I feel like they did this on purpose for laughs. On to some actual food reviews though... my friend got the sweet corn ravioli, which unfortunately about 5 min after the waitress left, we were informed they didn't have any more left by the manager. It was fine, they gave her a cheddar mash ravioli, which she said was really good. They comped her meal for her. Two of my other friends got the club. It looked like a burger to me, so I was confused, but they said it was delicious! Another person on our table got the fish and chips. I have to tell you, I watched her pick up the first piece of chicken and it literally fell apart like butter! Finally, I got the fried chicken. Oh em gee. It was so good! It came with mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and a honey drizzled biscuit. It was like an upgraded version of a meal from kfc but it is exactly what I had been craving! All in all this place is good. Be aware since they are a scratch based restaurant, they may run out of what you are ordering. Also, the wait staff does tend to take a long time to come back and check on you so you may be there a while."}
{"text":"This location is one of my favorites for a nice early evening/afternoon hangout. The food is a little pricey but the staff was great and bartenders were attentive when we just wanted to grab a drink and go play a few games of corn hole.

My only complaint is parking. It is very difficult to find parking at this location. They do have \"complimentary valet\" but let's be real, the valet boys here in America are working for tips, so it's not complimentary."}
{"text":"Let me start out....I am a huge fan of Fox Concept restaurants and have had nothing but good experiences at most, except Culinary.  The staff and service are both excellent, but I cannot get on board with the food.  Nothing special and a little pricey for what you are getting.

The atmosphere and decor of Culinary are both awesome and trendy, but the menu needs a little updating.  The drinks are fun, but the salad and the burger that I have had are bland, dry, and not worth the cost.  

I am always more than excited for a Fox Concept restaurant, but Culinary is not my favorite."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The food at the Hard Rock has always been a bit lacking to be honest, with the exception of Nobu. But now with Culinary Dropout, they have one of the best casual dining experiences on the Strip.

I'm not exaggerating when I say after 6 visits, I've yet to find a bad thing on the menu. I'll say my favorites are the Shaved Prime Rib Dip, the Fried Chicken and the 36 Hour Pork Ribs. The pretzel fondue is great, but I prefer the mussels, which are the best I've had anywhere. The Monkey Bread makes a great desert, but I'm especially fond of the carmel corn custard. It's really rich, but really, really excellent.

The service is fantastic. The staff is friendly and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. The decor is very cool and casual. It really feels like a place you enjoy hanging out.

They have music on Thursdays of Fridays. I haven't experienced it yet, but it looks like it would be a good time. 

If you're staying at the Hard Rock, this place is a must. If you're not, it's still worth checking out if you can."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome! Great decor and they had a live band the night we visited.That was the best part about this place.

Food was nothing to brag about. We ordered several appetizers - one of which was incredibly salty. The waiter, who recommend it, even agreed (after we insisted he taste it).

With so much more in the area, this place is a pass."}
{"text":"Went tonight good drinks good food good service and live music on a sunday night. Try the sausage and mushroom gnocci very tasty."}
{"text":"Always love coming to CDO Tempe. Lovely ambiance and service. Met Esther tonight and she was a complete delight. Thank you for an enjoyable Sunday evening."}
{"text":"Amazing time at CDO tonight. They were super busy but managed to get us a table within 20 mins. Matt always goes above and beyond as a manager to make everyone feel warm and welcome. Great hospitality, food, and management is outstanding every time!"}
{"text":"Delicious.... BUT 45 mins for a cheeseburger is no bueno for a half full restaurant!!

Server was super nice and apologetic but almost walked out. 

One more thing, the band tonight is TERRIBLE! You'd think the standards would be much higher at hard rock!"}
{"text":"Big big party (like thirty) and they were able to accomodate for lunch. Tried the house chips and (Buffalo) meatballs to start. For my main I went with the Turkey Pastrami: pretzel roll, slices of peppery turkey pastrami, lightly-dressed coleslaw, side of fries. Delicious, so much so that the guy sitting across from me had trouble getting my attention away from eating my sandwich. Small talk? Don't bother me, I'm hungry. It was pretty heavy and I did take half of the meal with me. Cool place, the patio seating looked nice too. Also, is it me, or is having visible tattoos part of the requirement of being a server there?"}
{"text":"I love this place. The bartenders are cool and very attentive. They have great food as well. My favorites are the soft pretzels and the sweet corn canneloni. This is more of a lunch place for me, the portions are a little small. Definitely a cool place to grab some food before hitting up Rehab."}
{"text":"This is a great place. I had the streak and potatoe entree and. It was delicious, but get the get the sauce on the side.  It was a bit over kill.  

The outside is fun with the whole setup of ping pong etc. Overall a fun place for friends to come hang out and have a good time,"}
{"text":"We were in town for a baseball game and decided to go here. The place is huge, there are a lot of games you can play very family oriented yet it feels good to just hang. The food was great fondue, fried chicken and shrimp salad is what we ordered and everything was bomb! Def. Make sure to stop by if u are in town... if you live in Phoenix I'm sure u know about this place already."}
{"text":"This is definitely a first for me. As fans of Fox's restaurants for over 15 years, we  were very interested in trying one of his Phoenix concepts.  With so many from which to choose....I'm afraid we just made the wrong decision. We purposely did NOT pre-read menus from any of restraints on the Fox web page. We were sure that wherever we chose to visit would more than likely be above average, so we wanted to be surprised.  Well....we were.
When we arrived, we were immediately seated by the usual beautiful young woman one usually finds manning the hostess station at any of Mr. Fox's establishments. The dining area was brilliantly lit and seemed to have ambiance on the forefront. Very nice place for cocktails or, in our case, just a bite.  Without going into too much detail about the food (the other reviewers will certainly cover that area), I'd like to discuss the menu itself.  
We tried a few things, all were good some were better than others.  The issue we had was fairly obvious....the menu was almost identical to every other bar and grill you'd find EVERYWHERE else!  There were few, if any, original or insightful appetizers or entrees to be found.  I mean I'm the sandwich section, there was an Italian Grinder, a chicken club and a French dip??? My god I couldn't think of a less thoughtful list of sandwiches if I tried.   Now maybe the point IS that the chef is a Culinary drop out this didn't make it to the class where ya learn the important of menu building... but nevertheless makes the best food ever!?  Either way, the food was good, we'll be sure to try the new location coming soon to Tucson.  After all, most things in our town taste better just cuz they're home!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a big thumbs up!  Great food, fast service, attentive and super fun.  A big thank you to Mike and Bria for making room for one and displaying great customer service.  #Topnotch #Greatfood"}
{"text":"i dunno what the deal is...but i was not terribly impressed with the pretzel fondue. the food was actually nothing to write home about. however...the adult beverages were superb! bacon infused bloody mary? hell yes! if you're a gin fan (and i am) then you must try velvet death. that's it, end of review."}
{"text":"We had a late dinner and drinks after seeing Raiding the Rock Vault.  The atmosphere was great. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable.  We were seated by Jess and taken care of by Devin, both were amazing! We had the pretzels and fondue, they were delicious. The pork belly nachos were oh so yummy! The Moscow mules were spot on as well! Definitely a place to go when at the Hard Rock! We will return to try more of their menu items next time. They also have live music sometimes too."}
{"text":"This was my third time at CD. Another Fox Concepts restaurant. Reasonably priced with a super happy hour! I had the $6 antipasti platter today. There was 1 meat, 1 cheese, almonds, some fruit and veggies, and crostini drizzled with balsamic vinegar.....right up my alley. Great place overall, I will definitely be back to CD in the near future. My only 2 gripes are that the \"grilled asparagus\" was cold for some reason, possibly because the rest of the platter was a cold preparation and the bartender was nice, but didn't interact quite enough with me and there were only a few people at the bar (she seemed content conversing with her coworkers rather than the customers)."}
{"text":"I have to update my review. Literally, 3 minutes after posting my original review I received a visit at our table by the manager! He apologized for the loud music and agreed that it was too loud and instructed the folks behind the bar to reduce the volume... talk about customer service! We promptly ordered another bottle of wine and enjoyed some wonderful conversation. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"two of my girlfriends and i went there on a sunday nite in march!  we thought it a bit too romantic for us with the low lites, etc but when in rome...we had a wonderful dinner, and shared dessert...the decor is definitely top notch!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST pretzel bites and cheese. I would say they are the best thing on their menu, and worth going to try. Their menu isn't very large, and the other things they do have to choose from are a little pricey but their food is quality and fresh. I would recommend this place (for the pretzel bites) and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Awesome! This place was great. The food was really good and they had a pretty good happy hour.  If you want to have a good time with a group of friend the dropout is where it's at."}
{"text":"The food, drinks, atmosphere, & service are always great here. I'll just say get the pretzel balls with cheese fondue, and the meatloaf is surprisingly amazing! Their menu is all pretty good but those two always stuck out to me as winners."}
{"text":"This was an embarrassing night for the amount of food we ordered. We had three appetizers - the bruschetta , pretzels , and the chips and French onion dip ( which they made fresh for us ). . . Not one bad thing we could say about them. We couldn't even compare and say which appetizer was best they were all amazing. The atmosphere is awesome in there. It's very trendy- the drinks / bartenders are amazing. The Italian chopped salad had a little too much meat on it for me - but still great nonetheless. Would definitely go back just for appetizers and drinks!"}
{"text":"Love it here, great food and fun atmosphere, always, but today we sat at the bar and placed ourselves in Matt's hands. He made great drinks, adjusted to suit our unique tastes. Wonderful guy, wonderful attitude and a great representative of the Dropout family."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go for awhile now- big fan of the fox concept restaurant line. Greeted with smiles by super tattooed host & young hostess... got a great table right under bob Marley (even though young hostess took us a terrible way through not too crowded dining area- we got stuck in the only crowded part and had to turn back-) had a decent greeting by server, obviously trained with a whole 'welcome have you been here before' rap... we answered 1st timers and she had a rap for that too, but while it was informative- it was said by rote- too fast and w no emotive quality at all. Too difficult to decipher. Genuinely engaged her in conversation regarding the fried chic timeline and the truth of how long it takes. And ordered it.  She was so into her rap, didn't hear my husband order- had to get her attention with a quick hand gesture and repeat his order.  
Spilled our drinks all over the table next to us.
Appetizers were great, even kids liked to spicy capicola. 
Dinner comes- she came to check we if everything was ok-& started to walk away before I even got the chance to ask her where my order was- the fried chicken we spoke about - she totally forgot to place the order...
ps- it was not worth the wait once it did come- after the 3 other people in my party were finished. 
Disappointed"}
{"text":"I've been to Culinary Dropout throughout the valley but this was my second time at this location. If I have one thing to say right off the bat is that the ambiance here is a 5/5. I like \"the yard's\" vibe a lot. The restaurant itself is open, clean, and \"hip\" for lack of a better term. The outdoor area was awesome. I didn't quite expect the ping pong tables nor the games of cornhole going on and it seemed to definitely liven up the mood. Maybe it's because I'm in my late twenties, but it seemed like a good mixture of customers ranging from college students to older folks who wanted to eat some brunch. I came here with my girlfriend as well as her dad today, and needless to say we enjoyed ourselves a lot. I find the menu to be just enough to make most guests fairly happy. If I had one qualm here it would be that the music was too loud. I initially thought it was because I was in the outdoor area, but it was the same as I walked through the inside to leave once finishing. We were almost yelling at each other across the table and we had to lean in to chat, but it wasn't a deal breaker.

Onto the F and B... I really enjoy the cocktails there. I'm typically a beer guy, but I definitely always resort to at least one glassed drink whenever I'm here. The matador is a must have, and the old fashioned is what I expect an old fashioned to be. No frills. For food we started with the black mussels (you can definitely taste the beer) and the shrimp caesar salad. For our entrees we got the 36 hour pork ribs, fish and chips, as well as the fried chicken. The ribs were what you think 36 hours of prep would be like. They fell cleanly off the bone and had just the right amount of sweetness. The fish in the fish and chips had a light crispy batter and the tartar sauce was great. My only complaint came from the fried chicken dish. It wasn't the fried chicken (the chicken is bomb and worth the wait as stated in the menu). The sides didn't live up to the chicken's standards. The biscuits had a great crust but ultimately were too dry. I know some people would argue that biscuits always dry your mouth out, but I found myself chugging water just to get onto the next bite. Onto the mashed potatoes. I never had their potatoes here, but simply put it was too salty. It may have just been today so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. However, just like the loud music definitely not a deal breaker. I won't go into service too deeply, but let's just say my water cup level never fell below half (they were very attentive), and the prices aren't too bad.

Overall I would recommend Culinary Dropout to most people, and I do."}
{"text":"Wow.  . . I loved the ambiance of this place. While I am no longer in college, I didn't feel like this was a location that only served collegiate customers, there appeared to be all age groups enjoying the company of everyone. 
We sat in the back, pass the bags and ping pong tables and it was a great atmosphere for talking to your group or meeting new people. While the menu is limited here, or it could have been the time (we arrived around 8 p.m.) the food was delicious. I had the Thai wings and several of my peers ordered the cheese and pretzels. The beer selection is pretty decent, for this time of year a lot of the micro brews have holiday selections, I recommend the Sleepy Dog. 
Despite the large crowd, the waitress was amazing and attended to our requests with a smile on our face (did I mention we were a large crowd??) I wish I had her name to give her a shout out! But all of the waiters seemed to be really on point.
I am hoping this place becomes a regular for my friends, I couldn't be more happy with my experience."}
{"text":"Very hip and trendy restaurant.  They have valet parking which I avoided by parking far away in the parking lot.

We had reservations and were seated right away.  Metal chairs were very uncomfortable.  Wish I would have asked that we be moved to padded chairs.

The food and atmosphere were great.  I had the meatloaf and my wife got a tuna seared salad.  For an appetizer we had pirogies. 

They were surprisingly busy for a Tuesday night so service could have been better.  Overall it was good."}
{"text":"We started out the day headed to Comicon but after seeing the CA-RAZY long line, we changed our minds. The BF suggested we go to Fashion Square to shop...WOOT!  We found this place almost by accident, just driving by and the name caught my eye...definitely happy we stopped here for lunch! 

The waiter was prompt, pleasant and efficient. Our food was excellent. I got the Spring veggie salad -- so fresh with an awesome vinaigrette! The BF got an amazing Pub Burger -- so big and juicy (but he immediately picked off the tomato)! I wanted to order the 12-hr Roasted Tomatoes and \"Crusty bread w/ good Olive oil\" for an appetizer. The tomatoes almost tasted like they were kinda pickled...and they were cold, which we didn't expect, but SO tasty! Sweet just like candy! BTW...It was after ordering this that I witnessed a first...THE BF ACTUALLY ATE THESE TOMATOES! Now THAT is saying something! I was totally blown away and actually took a picture! :o) 

With such a diverse menu, there is something for everyone...the little \"checklist\" appetizer menu was kind of neat in my opinion. Roasted beets, different little tapas-like meats and cheeses, crusty bread w/Olive oil...you could make a meal out of all that stuff alone! 

Tons of different drink options is always a plus too...even though I didn't get a drink at lunch, I saw LOTS of different ones I would have liked to try if it hadn't been 2:00 in the afternoon! 

All in all, I was very pleased and would definitely go back. There are so many more interesting things to try!"}
{"text":"We were wandering around the Hard Rock Hotel (where we were staying) looking for something to eat that didn't require us to get in our car and drive somewhere since we had an event that we needed to attend later that evening.  We stumbled upon Culinary Dropout.  The place looks really cool, and as we walked in we could hear live jazz music playing.  As we walked into the dimly lit restaurant, we could see that there were plenty of tables, inside and out, and there was a cute little oyster bar on one side.  Although there were a ton of open tables closer to the action (music, bar, etc), we were seated in a back corner by another entrance.  It was dark in there, we couldn't tell who the servers were, and it took a while before anyone approached us for drink orders.  I tried to remain calm, since I was starting to get hangry.  
Finally a friendly young gentleman approached our table and took our drink orders.  Overall, everything was pretty slow here.  Our drinks took a while to come out, it took a while to give our server the food orders, and it took a long while for our food to finally come out.  It was a little disconcerting, since it wasn't busy in the restaurant at all.  I usually give free passes when the place is swarming with people and the servers are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  

On to the food, I had the Prime Rib Dip.  It was ok, nothing mind-blowing.  The meat was tender, but tasted slightly over-seasoned, and the au jus was bland.  Weird combination, but I guess it balanced itself out.  My friend had the steamed mussels, and those were actually very good.  The flavor was really good, and the broth was sweet.  It was also a very nice portion.  I also got to try my boyfriend's entrée, he had the meatloaf.  It looked like homemade meatloaf covered in ketchup or some kind of red sauce.  It was a bit on the dry side, but the sauce helped.  

Overall, the food wasn't anything memorable and I probably wouldn't go out of my way the next time I'm in Vegas to eat here.  It was convenient, since we were staying in the hotel, but by no means was it a quick meal."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Austin location so ordered take away in Scottsdale. Chopped Salad, here is the menu description: ITALIAN CHOPPED $13
salami, turkey pastrami, ham, pickled vegetables, provolone, couscous, italian dressing

I asked for no pickled vegetables. They told me it would be 20 minutes. I arrived at restaurant 25 minutes later and paid my bill. They said my salad would be right out. Another 25 minutes later I finally got my salad. Took back to my hotel and find it covered in tomatoes and olives which are not listed on menu. Took two bites and had hair in my mouth that was NOT mine. 
Really disappointed and very hungry."}
{"text":"Nobody is perfect, but this is about as close as it gets. I LOVE the menu here. It is so simple, yet new and exciting. The picked peppers are delicious, as is their gourmet version of a Big Mac. Also try their asparagus and the cheap house salad. I really enjoyed my bacon infused bloody mary too. Garage parking can be an issue at peak times in this area - though a valet is always available."}
{"text":"When trying something new, I have learned not have any expectations, positive or negative,  until I have experienced it for myself. Otherwise, I've either felt let down because I expected too much or I didn't let myself have a good time because I nit picked everything.
Well for whatever reason I couldn't help but have high expectations of this place. Thankfully, it was one of the times where I was not let down!
I came here around 9 one night recently. I had heard about the long waits, so I had held off for a while but finally broke down and dragged a friend with me after work one night. She parked on the street, I valeted. For as busy as it was, my friend said there was plenty of street parking, I just wasn't paying attention. There was several cars in front of me, but the line moved fast, and I only had to wait a couple minutes before it was whisked off by some kid who probably just got his license last week (not complaining about skill, he just looked barely old enough to drive).
We walked right in and put our name on the list and had about a 30-45 min wait (which turned out to only be 25 min) so we walked to the bar ordered a couple drinks and went and sat in the Adirondack chairs by the ping pong tables. We sat, talked, watched people playing ping pong and having a good time. The atmosphere was loud, fun, and happy.
Once we received the text that our table was ready, the hostess walked us to our table and introduced our server who was friendly and sweet. we asked for recommendations and wound up ordering some cheese and pickled peppers to start which where delicious.
For our entrees, I had the fish and chips and she had the corn cannelloni. Wow! Seriously, some of the best fish and chips I have ever had. Light, buttery, flaky fish with flavorful, crunchy breading. My friends cannelloni was delicious as well, I only tasted a bite (I was surprised I was allowed that much) so I can't go too in depth about its deliciousness, but I would definitely order it for myself next time.
The portions were big, I took one piece of fish, half my fries and all my cole slaw home and she took almost half of her dish home.
For pickled peppers, cheese, fish and chips, cannelloni and 4 glasses of wine, our bill was $68. I don't know what people are complaining about. I really don't.
The prices are typical, the portions were good sizes, the drinks were big, the service was impeccable and valet is pretty standard for central and downtown Phoenix. I absolutely loved the Yard and can't wait to come back. All of you haters can go back to your suburban Olive Gardens and Applebees."}
{"text":"Just a lot of fun - pretzel bites and cocktails are great. Sitting outside and enjoying the weather (before it's 110 out!)"}
{"text":"This place is a real breath of fresh air for the HRH, who really needed something new in the food department.
Don't get me wrong, 35 and Nobu are both amazing restaurants if you want to drop some coin, and Mr Luckys is great for simple diner fare, but there was nothing really in between.
Now there is. 
Dropout has a really innovative menu, with lots of delicious and creative choices and preparations. They opened about a month ago, and since I work conveniently nearby, we have eaten there at least half a dozen times so far. 
Highlights include the raw bar, the antipasti menu, and the indoor/outdoor seating.
Well done HRH.
The only downsides so far has been the live acoustic music, which is hit or miss and always way too loud. (Hint: sit outside to avoid this)
And 2 separate times I got shrimp (Huge shrimp, sold by the piece) and they were a bit pasty on the outside, as if they were starting to turn, but the staff was quick to replace them.
So 1-star off for funky shrimp, but I do love this place."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner with 12 friends for my husband's birthday.  The atmosphere is great and the music was good as well.  We did not venture into the activity part of the restaurant since we had other plans after dinner.  Our table was great, the hostesses were friendly and efficient.  Our waitress was Alexis and she was terrific.  She did a great job serving us, our food was delivered to the table without any issues and at the end of the night when she had to split the bill 7 ways she did so with no problems!  I would definitely come back again, it was a great experience and the food was very good!"}
{"text":"Well, after further review

I just have to say that this place is actually pretty darn awesome I really feel like I went off half-cocked on my first experience never ever judge a book by its cover and my father taught me that but sometimes I fail to listen to the wisdom of my elders

If you would like to have a wonderful hamburger sandwich or steak or a nice antipasti or even just had a cold beer this is the place for just about everyone the food is of an exceptional quality the wait staff were actually really super nice and there is a good selection of music

The atmosphere is where it's at this place is awesome keep up the good work guys

Oh and by the way thank you so much for the wonderful dinner miss Emily"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. I was so excited to come here. I've heard great things about it. We had the pub burger, MAC burger, seared tuna salad, and the tacos. All of the items had something wrong with the order. The fries were over cooked. They forgot the cheese and bacon on my burger. They still put the dressing on the MAC burger even though we asked for it on the side. They dropped the last of the tuna on the floor so they had to sub shrimp on the salad (after coming to us to talk about the situation), but the shrimp's texture was weird and it didn't go well with the salad. 

Needless to say, the food was not impressive. The ambience was nice and the outside seating was amazing."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere in the culinary dropout. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating with some great views the the upscale Scottsdale area. I was a little disappointed in the menu as there weren't a lot of choices. It was a one page menu. Appetizers, entrees, desserts and drinks on the other.  I ordered the Italian chopped salad as my main course and was still hungry after I finished it for 13 dollars. I ordered two cocktails that were 7 dollars a piece. I made it out of there with a 29 dollar bill adding tip left 35 dollars lighter and still hungry. Lesson here it's a bit pricey but overall a good experience. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Awful service. I ordered food for pick up and they told me it would be a 15 minute wait. 30 minutes later, they give me the wrong order. After they finally say they'll give my chips they have me just waiting and no follow up by the waiter or anything. The atmosphere is great, unfortunately everything else is left to be desired. The manager came after and comped the appetizer, however, I don't think I'll be coming back. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Came into town for a bachelorette weekend. Couldn't be more happy with the #culinarydropout amazing staff,.DRINKS, and food.. the DJ was fabulous and I cannot wait to come back for this place"}
{"text":"I hate to judge on just soup but...

Soup shouldn't take 30 minutes.  At one point a bartender told me that it was ready, he just needed to pick it up. I didn't see him or it for 15 minutes. 

It then showed yay! And it was not good. This place is not worth visiting."}
{"text":"I love their ahi and shimp Caeser salads! The best. Drinks and wine selection is very wide. Service is always great."}
{"text":"Love it  food was really good. The pretzel bites were awesome and th3 fried chicken was full of flavor.  The server was very attentive and the vibe of the place was super. The chips were also good. Is located inside the Hard Rock hotel."}
{"text":"This is our usual go to for date night. The food is generally pretty good. Last time I went I had the Pub Burger and it was pretty tasty. The mashed potatoes are also fantastic. The service can be hit or miss, with some being attentive and others not so much. I do enjoy that it is part of the Yard. They do have ping pong, foosball, and cornhole games. I personally like coming on weekday nights when it's far less crowded."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Wanted a quick \"light\" dinner that ended up taking 2 HOURS!  Slow service and letting us know they were out of what we ordered after a loooong wait.  They did end up giving us more food than we ordered to try and compensate."}
{"text":"To start with, the first thing that comes to mind here is how entirely comfortable and pampered they make you feel. It's been a few weeks so I'm trying to remember everything we had. Okay, we had the fried chicken. The chicken was wonderful, juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I think the gravy needed some work. We also had the Charred broccoli with red chili oil, the Korean-style brussels sprouts, and a cheese plate.  All were very tasty. I especially liked the brussel sprouts. Someone called them \"Addictive.\" I concur. We continued our pig-out with the SOFT PRETZELS & PROVOLONE FONDUE (forgive me for I copy and paste). This was decadent. I had the Room Service cocktail. It was expensive, but I loved it. I think $7 would be an adequate price, but then again, I'm cheap. We topped everything off with the Monkey Bread. It was gooey and good.

Quite frankly, this is a fun place. We will be back to try more of the food and drink. You have so many choices in Vegas. You should make this place one of them."}
{"text":"The Bacon Bloody Mary was amazing!  So was the Cap'n Crunch crusted French toast and the atmosphere... relaxing on the patio by the pool while sipping our drinks and eating breakfast.  Really looking forward to my next visit to Culinary Dropout!"}
{"text":"We went there for my sons graduation dinner and we enjoyed and had a good time with my teenagers kids .,we got the pretzels,meatloaf,Thai wings and the burgers they were really good only reason why not the 5 start the server ignore us almost the whole time we had to ask him and look for him to fill up our drinks even though he thought he was all that bragging about celebrities and stuff ..... and still we just play chill and cool cause we were celebrating"}
{"text":"The food is good, it is a \"scratch\" kitchen, so you can customize you can request changes to the dish you order to your liking. A little on the pricier side, but there is a good environment and live music in the evenings. Since it is a very relaxed atmosphere,  waiters don't wear uniforms and sometimes it is difficult to identify who works there, but normally the staff is very attentive so they will good care of you. Uniquely divided interior space when you walk in. Open concept, yet tables are spaced far enough apart for room to talk and to hear yourself talk. If you want to be active, there is corn hole, ping pong and other games. Fireplaces and heaters for cool nights and tons of tv's to watch games. Large rooms for private events and live music or music playing. Different spaces from sports bar to lounge. Valet parking is offered but it's not necessary, there is usually plenty of spots in the self service parking lot."}
{"text":"Seriously everything I had here was amazing. The food is wonderful! I ordered the artichoke heart appetizer and it was to die for. Also chose the rainbow trout again amazing. It is a little loud for my taste but the service, food and drinks make up for it ten fold."}
{"text":"The service was great, very friendly and down-to-earth. My son had the steak and I had the salmon and both were awesome. We walked away full, relaxed & happy."}
{"text":"Researching a place to eat this restaurant group receives high marks so we made the trip from the east valley.

The service was good.   Our server spaced it a few times but was hustling so it wasn't a big deal and we really appreciated his effort.  He was friendly and polite and to the point.  

The food was good.  The thai chicken wings were spicy and full of flavor.  The Kale and corn salad, a heaping side of greens and goodies.  Perfect dinner salad.  We also ordered the Ramen.  The broth was savory with the perfectly cooked runny egg split open.  Noodles cooked nicely as well but the lack luster zucchini was pretty boring.  Still a great dish though but I wish I would've chose the fried chicken.

The atmosphere-

Large space with tall ceilings and a large patio.

Frat house-Bro bar mixed with upscale Hampton-ish hipsters with a side of beautiful people.   Strange."}
{"text":"Get the cheese and pretzels while chilling out in The Yard. 

You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Only been twice and it has been OUTSTANDING.  The pretzel fondue is wonderful.  The fried chicken is like no other - crisp and honey flavored.  Desserts are original and filling.  Great friendly service.  Large portions - enough for leftovers.  I am giving it a 4 because it is really loud and noisy when it is busy.  I found it hard to hear those at my table and felt like I needed to yell for them to hear me.  Don't let that stop you from going because the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Recently I had an incident with the valet at Culinary Dropout and I am so impressed with how the owner Hank addressed everything. Hank was prompt in getting back and went out of his way to make me feel understood and valued as a customer. I would highly recommend this restaurant not only for the amazing food but service as well. The team at this establishment are so friendly and on top of everything. Thanks you all for your outstanding hospitality!"}
{"text":"Food is fun and unique. Servers are friendly. The atmosphere is warehouse remodel, fun. The only challenge is it is very loud."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit here. This was by far the BEST visit to date. I finally ordered the right entree. The Korean style rib eye caps were beyond words. Extremely moist and very tender with no Gristle. The julienne vegetables were on top of the steak and it had a nice finish that was kind of hot but not too hot. Frankly I put this entree up with some of the best ever. The beats were amazing,  the brussel sprouts are amazing, the drinks are amazing, the live entertainment was amazing and the Warriors Cleveland Cavaliers game is also amazing I will be back and I will bring lots of people with me next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time a few days ago.  HOLY CRAP this place is amazing.  It is a Gastropub with a very cool atmosphere and the food was so good i had the chicken sandwich and pretzels bites soooo good. I will definately go back there. Very chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for food and drinks. Over all a fun environment with a few bar games to play as you sip your beverages."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's a regular thing, but the only way to park there was through valet parking, and although it was complimentary, that just irks me every time. Now that that's out of the way, the rest of the experience was quite fantastic actually. The place is very well laid out and it's easy to find things as various sections are separated by glass walls. The yard itself  (with free games and lots of comfy seating) is just a sea of change from the typical restaurants you see in the area. The bar area is on the larger scale of things, with one side that opens up to the yard part. The food was good, but not groundbreaking, and the folks working there were very nice. Definitely a good restaurant to check out and worth the experience of having, just try not to get lost in their maze of a bathroom (that one is worth checking out as well -- as long as you're not prone to getting lost). Maybe adult supervision would be helpful for me."}
{"text":"Pretzel Fondue was good, staff \"ok\", steak unimpressed. For the price of the food I was very underwhelmed. Too hipster for this 20-something East valley girl lol if that's possible."}
{"text":"Tip 1: Make reservations or prepare to wait.  Or so I am told.  Always make a reservation and never wait longer then 5 minutes.  So if you don't, don't complain as I told you too. 

Tip 2: Free Valet Parking = So awesome.  Don't forget to tip. 

Tip 3:  Pretzel Fondu is an absolute must get, no discussion just get it.  Check out Luice T review for more on it. 

Just like the phx location this place has a great atmosphere, very casual, open and fun.  
I always feel welcome and relaxed here.  

There old fashions are pretty good too, as is the rest of their drink options.  

Honey Chicken is true to its name, and delicious. 
Also a fan of their Turkey Pastrami.  

But you should order what you want not what I want.  With the exception of the fondu thats a must have."}
{"text":"Fantastic vibe, food and fun.  Had a large group and everyone loved the drinks and menu items.  We shared lots of apps, had great meals, and enjoyed the games.  Being the one person from AZ in the group, I had to pick the spot for my coworkers, and I am glad i selected Culinary Dropout.  Will return!"}
{"text":"This place has a super hip interior and the dining experience was lovely. Our server was attentive and the inside has a variety of funky chairs, a tin tiled wall, and huge chandeliers. I got the kale salad and la vida verde cocktail. Both were very delicious!  

My husband got the prime rib dip. He raved about it all day! 

I always look at the cleanliness of the bathrooms and they were super clean and the soap smelled so wonderful. 

I am visiting from Chicago but would come back here for sure on my next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just like everyone said, this place is loud.

So I went on a date here and it actually helped. My date had to sit next to me for us to even carry a conversation so that was nice. The service was good, our waiter was very sociable and had many suggestions. Now to the food.

We got the pretzels with cheese and honestly, I prefer the mall pretzels with cheese. The salmon was also only okay. The drinks were refreshing but I was really turned off by how dark and loud the place was. Was definitely over hyped for me, probably wouldnt go back"}

Arriving at The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in the midst of Rehab with my mother and aunt in tow as Springsteen played overhead one can only call the scene en route to brunch part of the show, a five minute walk from Paradise parking to Fox Concepts' \"Culinary Dropout\" bespecked with the scantily clad and already drunken while the restaurant itself proved a comparative sea of tranquility matched to good food and unexpectedly stunning service.  Sprawling in size with garage-style doors open to the cool morning breeze of a picturesque patio it was close to the rounded bar with a full view of both stage and kitchen that our trio found itself located mere moments after entry and with coffee kept brimming from seating to finale a six-piece order was crafted, each item arriving individually with smooth pacing and beautiful presentation.  Largely focusing on signatures but equally willing to explore seasonal preps and brunch-only items it was with the restaurant's oft raved pretzel bites that the meal began and with rich fondue gilding golden soft nuggets we all agreed that rare has a pretzel impressed so much, a similar praise heaped on the house burrata with seasonal accoutrements drizzled with aged balsamic.  Moving next to things more substantial it was admittedly with some disappointment that neither the $11 French Toast nor the $21 'worth the wait' fried chicken proved nearly as memorable as their respective milk jam or biscuit plate-mates, but with the former too bready and the later far from crispy there are simply better versions to be found elsewhere, particularly at such a cost.  At this point sated but certainly not full, the kitchen would quickly rally back with a duo of desserts and while the piping hot monkey bread certainly deserves the attention it has garnered it was the caramel-corn studded budino that stole the show for me, a dense pudding both salty and sweet with crunch and cream taken perfectly with another cup of coffee as Chris Cornell crooned overhead."}
{"text":"Met every expectation on first visit, food service and ambiance all a wow .. we had the frittata and the breakfast burrito both above and beyond. Phx mag was on point the place is krackin. Def headed back for lunch next."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is an awesome place for a great meal, drinks, and hanging out with friends while catching the game. The place is casual and fun - medium-high in terms of ambiance noise. They also had a duo of live performers when we were there, singing some pretty old pop love songs. I came by on a Wednesday and found it not too packed, although this place is huge and even has a number of reservable dining rooms. 

For food, we ordered the nachos and I got the bistro steak (wanted the 36-hour pork chops but sadly they were out of it by 9pm). The bistro steak was tender and juicy, and the sauce it came with was a fabulous complement. Nachos were fully loaded and definitely a great app for sharing. Service here was nice albeit at times, a bit slow. All in all, a fun place to grab food and hang out."}
{"text":"All time favorite food spot 

They got a chill vibe here, food is always great
I love food in general but my significant other is a picky eater..so I was hesitant to bring him here but so far he loves this place as do I. 
My favs are turkey pastrami & beer battered fish and chips, Significant other orders the rainbow trout or bistro steak.
I've been here over 5 times and service is amazing. I would definitely recommend this place! 

Every time my families in town I treat them out here :) 5+"}
{"text":"Pretty good for hard rock. We decided to sit on the patio and it was beautiful! Service was good and the ambiance was perfect. We ordered the mussels and did not like them they were super bland. The kimchi flank steak was very good and the fried chicken with biscuits was amazing. The drinks were pretty interesting too and my bf had one and it was very good. The music was indie. One thing I didn't like I couldn't differentiate the servers from guest. This is a hipster spot but I still liked it. Pricing was around $20 for an entree.

PROS: Ambiance, service, outside patio, drinks, music
CONS: price, servers uniforms, mussels"}
{"text":"Vegas local,  have not been to Hard Rock in a while, came with two friends , hung out at bar, awesome bartender Matt!   Great food.,  great service and super cool beverages!   The Saturday brunch place to be !"}
{"text":"I came by for cocktail week and they were offering St. Germain drinks. One was basically the same cocktail suggested by St. Germain, so we didn't bother. The other was a bit too sweet for my tastes. Our bartender sneaked us a taste of Ransom Old Tom Gin and it was the most glorious thing to ever touch my lips. 

The food was a bit pricey and they had some mildly interesting menu items. Much of what I imagined someone who couldn't hack culinary school would make. 

Par for the course."}
{"text":"I had pierogies and their signature sandwich turkey and pastrami. The pierogies were good but I wish they would have put more of the garnishes (cauliflower and roasted brussel sprouts). The turkey and pastrami sandwich on a pretzel roll was good but better for a lunch not dinner. Very disappointed when the only dark beer they had was Guinness. Was hoping they would have some local Stouts."}
{"text":"Staff attitude makes a helluva difference to me when I'm considering where to frequent and that's why I've dined at Culinary Dropout a sh*tload.

I haven't been to the other locations in Scottsdale or Vegas so I'm only speaking for the 7th. Street venue. Everyone engages with you and they all seem to be really into the kind of food & beverages that they're serving. You already know you won't get a conversation about whether they have lox or nova salmon at a chain restaurant, but you can talk that sh*t here with servers who can riff on it with you.

Pretzel bites with fondue are a mainstay. So is a sampling of their cold cuts and some crusty bread with olive oil. They pour sweet balsamic vinegar into the oil so dip it deep, y'all, and hit that spot.

Seared Tuna Salad is my favorite for lunch, followed by the French Dip sammich. I've tried the fried chicken and it wasn't the move for me. First of all, it's got a sweet tasting crust and some Indian or Mexican spices rubbed into it which together make me believe that they batter the chicken in Frosted Flakes and Coriander with a lil chili powder. I'm all for trying stuff, but I think as a Southerner that I am a fried chicken purist who expects savory, not sweet.

Ask for a booth if they have one open. Tell the girl in the red top sitting by the stage who accidentally smacked me as I walked by to call me because she was fine as hell and I would sop her up with a Culinary Dropout biscuit."}
{"text":"This place has a positive ambiance. I met a woman here for our first date and although it was very crowded (Wednesday) and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, once we were seated, the other tables, the crowd, and even the live music on stage were not at all frustrating distractions; my date and I were able to talk and get to know one another in peace and comfort. 

Management was very prompt and attentive when my glass of water accidentally shattered as our waitress was attempting to refill it. They even comped us dessert (Monkey Bread), which was delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered two drinks, fried chicken, and pork belly nachos. Drinks took forever to arrive...our food got to our table first! The fried chicken was great. Yummy flavor on breading and fried really well. Nachos had a great flavor but there was not a great ratio of toppings to chips so we had tons of chips left over. But we did enjoy what we had!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great atmosphere lots of space to hang out. The food was amazing, we had the Pork Belly nachos and the fondue pretzel ! DELICIOUS! Great drinks & hangout, our server Ryan was awesome too!"}
{"text":"The Tempe location of Culinary Dropout is way better than any other location. Their location has access to \"the yard\" and their food and drinks are good 4/5 times. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yikes this place is nothing short of a facade. Wonderful location with a large bar and backyard games BUT the service is rude and the food could be from T.G.I. Friday's you wouldn't know the difference. Price point is high so you've gotta question why on earth you'd go here. Buy a corn hole and grill in your backyard."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to go to Culinary Dropout for a long time. The service was fantastic and the ambiance was very lively. 
The appetizers are fun because you can make your own boards with meats, cheeses, deviled eggs and other sides. 
My husband had the turkey pastrami and said it was pretty good. Our friends had the meatloaf and steak and absolutely loved it. I had the tomato bisque which was a little too spicey and not very creamy. 
Fun place, good music, we'd come back."}
{"text":"The ambiance at this place is fantastic! Music is good libations are flowing, people watching is stellar too. The hummus wasn't great, but everything else was delicious!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals I've had in Vegas. Came here with a group of 6 for dinner before hitting the clubs. The Menu seemed interesting with a good selection of something for everyone. The layout of the restaurant is REALLY nice! I was shocked when we arrived at 8pm on a Sunday night and nearly the entire restaurant was empty. There were no more than 5 occupied tables. Not a good sign, but based on the high Yelp reviews, we assumed it was just a slow night. 

We started off with the Soft Pretzels with provolone fondue. When it arrived we immediately had to send it back because the cheese was cold. When it came back it was lukewarm and still didn't have too much flavor. For my main entree I had the Pork Belly Ramen which was also disappointing. The Pork belly wasn't tender at ALL (actually rough and hard to chew) and the broth was bland. My friend ordered the fried chicken and it also wasn't good...and it was cold! Our waiter felt bad about the experience and comped his meal, which was a nice gesture. 

The only thing this place has going for itself is strong drinks and a great wait staff. Our servers were super pleasant and accommodating. Not sure if we came on an \"off\" night, but all of our meals were mediocre at best."}
{"text":"For all its hype I was not impressed...

Parking was weird to get to and the food was mediocre. I went back a second time and while I knew where to park this time service was still slow and food was mediocre. How do you mess up pretzels? So dry and bland...

I thought I ordered a salad from what the waiter explained, turns out it was a wedge of lettuce with randomness... My friend got a burger and we split it. She only had a few bites.

They do have local brand beers. Bad Water Brewing was the only reason I drank a beer though.

For the hype I'd expect a bit better service and it to be a bit more flavorful. Idk just seemed like bland dive bar food... If we want a burger we decided to stick to FEZ or Zinburger. 

I had high hopes! I wanted to fall in love so bad!"}
{"text":"This was our first food stop - night out on Scottsdale through word of mouth and recommendations.  It was alriiiiiight.  Cool scene.  Cool vibe.  OK food.  The burger was bomb.  Everything else such as the meats and cheeses were pretty good too.  The drinks are creative and cool and the setting is poppin.  So, ironically, it gets more props for their mixology versus the actual culinary from me.  And it's pricey.

I'd be back for drinks and apps when back in town."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great environment, and an amazing staff! Highly recommended if you want to try something new!"}
{"text":"I split an order with my mom and the entire order was wrong. The order was fixed but then the waitress didn't even bother to discount our bill. This was a dinner for my bachelorette party and I sat at the table waiting for my order to be corrected while my friends and family were able to enjoy their food. I can't say that I'll be back. Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"The cocktails are pretty poor and the food is pretty good. Ramen was surprisingly good. Last time I went, our server didn't know what an old fashioned was and had to ask me. I told her the bartender would know and she insisted I explain it to her just in case. I did. Then I received a watered down, semi-cold Jack and Coke.  

*Editing my initial post to remove some snark, since the manager contacted me and offered to make it right. Not interested enough in the restaraunt to take him up, but still a nice gesture."}
{"text":"So I keep coming back for a couple reasons, theres lots of space & things to do (i.e games, live music) & they have my favorite beer available (Papago brewery Orange Blossom).

The food here is mediocre & to be honest, overpriced.. & their best thing on the menu is the Beer Cheese Pretzels.

The thing that irks me about the games is that there is always long wait times & people can check out the equipment & then go back & sit at their table for however long without even actually using it.

I'll keep coming back because its a cool place to hang out, especially if youre with a large group, but I'll probably make sure to frequent the Tempe location since it seems like that one is a little more organized & well kept."}
{"text":"They have the best pretzel bites out of any restaurant that I've ever been too. The aroma of the restaurant is very nice and comfortable they have something for everyone there"}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal! We were seated right away, however, it was a Sunday night and it was 5:30pm. I ordered the trout, it was fantastic! My friends had the meatloaf, steak and ribs. All had great reviews. The desserts were equally as fabulous! Service was great. Only complaint, it was too dark in the restaurant. I will go back!"}
{"text":"Fox Restaurants is part of my portfolio of good eats, however Culinary Dropout in Tempe is not 1 of them. First off; the make up air system for the exhaust grease hoods is waaayyy off, when you enter the building you experience the \"wiff\" of a back alley Japanese teppanyaki grease fryer-smoke sensation, I had to drop off my clothes at the dry cleaners the next morning to rid this odor. If your not familiar with make up air its the air that is pumped in from the roof to provide the exhaust grease hood to make up for the air its exhausting, sometimes too close to an HVAC unit on the roof it gets pumped in for the patrons to breathe and smell. Second; the layout feels like a junior high school cafeteria with tables lined up in parallel, with all the \"cool kids\" having fun tossing bags of beans back and forth in the adjoining Yard. Third; our server was pleasant, speedy, but lacked a smile, maybe had a bad day who knows? Fourth; we ordered the \"36 hour pork ribs\", mistake, they were cold, apx. room temperature or just below, I felt like a cave man chewing the hard to separate meat off the bone, after which we asked where the restrooms were so we could wash our hands from all of the bbq sauce, our server pointed the way down a dreary hallway, why don't they provide a wet nap at minimum, for the $25 plate they should provide a hot towel! 

Culinary Dropout is a great matching name for the restaurant, I think every one staffed there may just be Drop Outs..."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm biased because I love fox concepts, but gd I love culinary. 
Went today with family around, noon or so. Ashley was our server, not only was she super cute but she was super sweet. 
We got the meatloaf (I use to go to the Scottsdale location so I could get it because it is, in fact, that good), the fish and chips (Jesus, I've ever gotten them before but I'm going to start now) and the pub burger (a classic). Everything was amazing. 
I definitely plan to keep going back, I haven't had one bad experience yet. 
Oh, and their cocktails, phenomenal."}
{"text":"This place is one of the cutest/coolest restaurants that I have been to. The overall ambiance is great w/ the unique furniture, trendy dressed waiters/waitresses the rock music in the background.... As for the food, it was pretty good. We did order their famous pretzel & cheese fondue, but I was a bit disappointed because the fondue looked like it was half eaten because they didn't fill the pot up all the way. They should at least get smaller pots OR fill it up all the way! haha! i also had the turkey pastrami on a pretzel bun... The pretzel bun really made the sandwich unique & delicious! AND they also brought out a complimentary dessert because my cousins food came out late. The dessert was soooo delicious! it was some sort of butterscotch custard w/ caramel popcorn! YUM!"}
{"text":"I met with Sam Fox many years ago in Tucson.  I built a website for his restaurant WildFlower Grill when I used to work for the Arizona Daily Star.  Now his empire has vastly grown and includes Culinary Dropout.

With my first time being here, we met up with some friends here for lunch. My wife and I usually split entrees when we go out.  When we are on vacation, we don't really like to take \"home\" leftovers (i.e. back to the hotel).  We split the Shaved Prime Rib Dip sammich and it was honestly one of the best I have ever had.  The bread was soft, instead of hard and crunchy like most other places I've tried.

My friend had the Green Chile Stew.  The server really talked it up so he was expecting it to be amazing, but it was just good (which isn't bad).

My one gripe with these new, trendy restaurants is the choice is seating.  The metal chairs are painful to sit on...no padding whatsoever.  This is a big deal and factors in my decision to ever come back.  They do have couch-style seating which is much better.  Some of the couches surround fire-pits which is really nice to have when it's chilly.

A note on parking:  we parked in the \"front\" of what we thought was the restaurant.  It turns out the restaurant is in the far back of the building.  Park on the side where there is another entrance to CD.  

Also, this place goes by another name:  The Yard at Farmer's District.  I believe it's the outdoorsy area where you can play shuffle board, cornhole and other games.  There's also a bar behind the play area.  It even has it's own Yelp page, which curiously enough - also points to Culinary Dropout.

Overall, we had a good experience.  The beers were cold, service was prompt and the food delicious.  Just remember to bring  a seat pad with you if you decide to visit ;-)"}
{"text":"I had the corn cannelloni and it was sublime! My boyfriend had the ribs. The sauce was delicious and the meat was fall off the bone. The service was great. Try the peach and vanilla infused whiskey shot; good end to a tough week!"}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey but not too bad. Had the day old soup(beef stew), chicharron from the antipasti menu and the prime rib dip. Everything was good. Could have gone without the chicharron tho. My friends ordered the jalapeño drinks and loved them. We also got the nachos for the table w pork belly and it was the best thing on the table. My other friend got the mussels. He enjoyed them. I tried one but it was fishy. However I usually don't like mussels so I'm not the best judge of them. Great ambiance. Overlooking the pool, cornhole and large couches to hangout. They also have live music.  We were there w 2 girls that fiddle and they were sooo good!!  If we didn't have a show to go to we would have stayed. Management if you have their name so I can follow them I would appreciate it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service even though the place was packed with high school prom attendees!!"}
{"text":"This little place hidden inside the Hard Rock Casino was amazing!  AN and I were in Vegas on business and we took a few people out to lunch one afternoon.  We walked into the Hard Rock casino no clue where we were heading and saw The Culinary Drop Out!  We were quickly seated and our waitress appeared right from the beginning to be on top of it!  Our table had an amazing view of the pool and cabanas! The decor was super cool with what appeared to have a garage warehouse look and feel!  We ordered appetizers for the table, soft pretzel bites with cheese fondu dip and we also asked for a side of honey mustard and we also ordered homemade chips with French onion dip as well and the table loved them! It was perfect.  Our super awesome waitress took our lunch order and four of the five of us ordered there salads and there's always that one who gets the burger! LOL!  Our salads were perfect! I had the crispy shrimp ceaser salad and it was amazing!  AN had the strawberry and kale salad and she loved it as well! But we both kept eyeing that Pub Burger across the table that looked sooooo good! The Culinary Drop Out in Las Vegas at The Hard Rock was amazing, the food, the service and the ambiance were all perfect! And for Las Vegas the prices were good too! I recommend trying them out and we will come back!"}
{"text":"August is the best bartender I've ever been served by. Attentive, accommodating, and helpful - - everything you could want! Thank you for a lovely experience, August!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night. The atmosphere is not like any other place in Tempe. Lots of space, high ceilings great atmosphere. And there was a live band, but the music was not so loud you could still hold a conversation. I really felt relaxed in the place. We had a 15 minute wait for our table, so we decided to sit at the bar seating and get some drinks in the meantime. We ended up just ordering food at the bar and stayed where we were. I honestly prefer bar seating anyway. Service was great. I ordered the Salmon and had captain and soda water for a drink. It was amazing! I don't know how I never knew about this place before."}
{"text":"I dislike the fake wait list. So the company policy wait list is inefficient. Those driving your car to this place will not understand this but wait till you are waiting 90 minutes and there are tables empty the entire time. Servers are understanding. Policy needs reshuffling."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a beer and a snack.  Temp was around 70 so we sat outside.

My amber ale from Breckenridge was good, and my wife ordered the cheaper of their Pinot Noir's and it was also good.  Waiter was friendly and genuine.

I like their anti pasti menu.  You can pick and choose what you want.  We tried the 12-hour roasted tomatoes, olives, some almonds, manchego cheese, and sopresseta.  It was all good.

We are eager to go back and eat dinner - the menu looked appetizing."}
{"text":"Yummy the vodka, ginger, lime mule is the bomb! I had the seared tuna salad. My husband had bistro steak with herb fries, (small portion), both were delicious. We also ordered hairloom herb tomatoes, with garlic goat cheese and garlic balsamic taost. All very tasty. 
A little pricy. However I would return."}
{"text":"My family and I went here today for Easter. Our waiters name was Michael and I just have to say the service was AMAZING. He never let our waters fall below half way filled. Every time my daughter's soda looked watered down or flat, he brought another one out right away. He checked on us often and made our experience here the best it could possibly be. This dining experience was the best yet! We enjoyed every minute of it."}
{"text":"Where to begin? Pork belly toast or smoked salmon Bruchetta maybe the  Korean chicken Shrimp skewer? My  pallet craving nothing specific but good food . I had it all ! My stomach is pleased with me and of course the beautiful blonde that delivered the satisfying morsels of goodness. The only drawback is that it is not in stunning Colorado. Happens to be in Vegas !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I came here for lunch and we started by making our own cheese platter. We started with the deviled eggs (SO good), the cheddar, hot salami, prosciutto, and pimento (YUM). I got the minestrone soup, it was mediocre. But the grilled cheese bites were amazing. Also got the grilled chicken sandwich which was huge. The drinks were trendy and delicious. Our waiter was so nice, though I forget his name. I would love to come back if only I lived in Arizona. Come to California please!!"}
{"text":"The mixology chemist behind the bar are good. They have a few really good drinks. I like the Smashed Irishman. Pub Burger and Turkey Pastrami are outstanding! Awesome for groups and hanging out with friends. Cornhole, Ping Pong, lots of TVs."}
{"text":"This restaurant on a Friday night is an interesting mixture of people. Floppy drunk college kids, elderly people, and hipster couples with their babies. I've been several times and enjoyed the Korean style ribeye, and the butternut squash ravioli-I think they call it something else...cannoloni? The desserts are really, really sweet and if you don't enjoy sugar and caramel, maybe skip dessert. I am usually a big fan of dessert after a meal, but the options here always seem to be overly sweet and not very complex. This is a place I usually leave happy and not full of regret that I paid for a meal I could've cooked better myself at home-which happens too often in Tempe restaurants."}
{"text":"The best spot in Vegas. Go for the drinks, stay for the food. And ask for Rae!  Best. Server. Ever. We gorged on mussels, frittata, deviled eggs and smoked salmon. And the bacon-infused bloodies...just do it."}
{"text":"I was able to make last minute lunch reservations for a group of 8 for 30 minutes after my call time. I was not able to make them online for the same time though, so try calling them if you are denied online. 

My lunch was delicious (I had the strawberry & kale salad with chicken) and everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their food. I did not have any, but the pretzel bites appetizer was a big hit at our table as well. 

The place was fairly crowded, probably because of ASU graduations, and it made our wait time to get our meals pretty long. Someone other than our server (a manager perhaps) came over to our table at one point and apologized for the long wait. 

The food was really good though. So if you've got the ability to take a long lunch, I definitely recommend this place. A little pricey for an everyday lunch spot, but this was a work lunch, so it worked well for us."}
{"text":"Excellent spicy wings, especially during Happy Hour, with a generous amount of special teriyaki slaw with peanuts topping the wings; that was my favorite part! ~Delicious!! Their pretzel bites with hot cheese sauce are another Happy Hour favorite. Our server had such an outgoing and sweet personality. She was so attentive and came by our table numerous times to see if we needed another drink and if everything was great. We had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Service was awesome!!  The cheese and Brussels sprouts were delicious.  My wife had the kale and butternut squash salad which her reaction was this is AWESOME!!!!! I had the korean style ribeye cap....the sauce is out of this world not to spicy but had a kick.  Again awesome service."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about checking out Culinary Dropout, think again. While the portion sizes are large, you'll be lucky if you can finish your leftovers, since the food is mediocre at best. Happy hour prices are good, but the menu is unclear about which drinks are discounted. Staff and/or the menu should make happy hour pricing more clear- on multiple occasions, I have ordered a drink thinking it was well priced, only to be charged full price when my bill comes.  Really spoils the experience...and it seems obvious that someone coming during happy hour is probably there to take advantage of happy hour pricing. Regular pricing is high considering the quality of food. And while the atmosphere is young and fun, service is consistently terrible; expect to be double charged for something at least 60% of the time, and unattended to by your server the remaining 40% of the time."}
{"text":"Loved the funky poolside living room ambience, loved the salad, loved the service, loved the shoes."}
{"text":"Great food and great service from Rachel.   Make sure you ask for her.   She deserves big tips.   Don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and great environment. The restaurant layout is so beautiful. It's an open warehouse concept with lots of light coming inside. It isn't too loud, perfect for a date night. The food was spectacular! You must try the fried chicken."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place and the food menu is excellent. The games and choice of atmosphere are great. The only reason I did not rate 5 stars is because the wine list is all very sweet. Between myself and my friends we tried every wine on the menu - all were very, very sweet. I don't want a cabernet that tastes like fruit juice. Beer is clearly the way to go at this location, preferably with some of their delicious pretzel bread and provolone beer cheese. 

Also - most of the wait staff is excellent, but we ended up with a dud on this visit. He was a douchey hipster in a hat who at one point said I could not order a glass of wine because it was on tap at a bar on the other side of the restaurant - somehow another waiter had no problem getting it for me."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday for my first time with a friend, let me tell you it's pretty chill and the food is excellent, I had the meatloaf soooo good, and the pretzels with cheese also really yummy and I ordered a prime rib sandwich to go and eat it later on that day and it was the best prime rib sandwich I ever had hands down, definitely coming back soon..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, a must every time I'm in Vegas. Visited for the first time before I was Vegan and was absolutely in love with their decent size portions and delicious food. The staff is made of hip, good looking people but so welcoming and knowledgable. Happy hour is a must at this place. The place is beautiful."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite restaurant inside the Hard Rock Hotel! The menu is very fun, my favorite is the pretzels and fondue! The food comes out very fast and if you go during happy hour the prices are great!"}
{"text":"The food is way overpriced for the quality. It's a good hang out for college kids. They were out of items on the menu. Small portions. Overall, very busy. Bar atmosphere. Food ok. Service was good."}
{"text":"Weekend trip to Tempe, and I ate here twice - this place was fantastic for kicking back and grabbing a drink and some snacks. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place 2.5 stars, but that is not an option. 

Let me start by saying that this place is new, so there is room / a grace period for improvement.

With that said, I just wasn't that impressed.  This is not to say the food wasn't good or the service was bad, it just didn't stand out to me.  On a very positive note, it is beautifully decorated and the patio rocks.

I will start with the food.  My friend and I met here for \"happy hour\"; we didn't learn until after we sat down and got comfy, they don't have one.  Even Morton's has happy hour, why don't you???  That kind of irked me since I'm always on a budget seeing as how I go out every night.  Anyways, we each got a glass of wine, easy peasy and we started to peruse the menu.  Let me tell you, this is not a vegetarian friendly place.  I am not a vegetarian, but I am VERY picky about my meats.  We ordered a cheese plate with olives to start, good, but kind of pricey for what you get.  And, I wish the waitress would have told us that the two we picked out were very similar.  She was very informative and helpful when we asked her questions, but I guess she didn't feel like offering up this tidbit.  After the appetizer, we both ordered salads as our entrees.  I had the smoked chicken salad and my dining companion had the chopped salad.  Both were very good and decent sized for entrees.  The only complaint I had was there was a little too much dressing, but that can be easily fixed.  I would say, all in all, the food was good, but not great.  I guess I was just expecting something more.  For three women to spend $80 on dinner, it probably should have been a little more impressive.

I am a big fan of Sam Fox and I think this place has potential, I think they just need a little bit of time.  I don't know if I will be going back any time soon.  I know I won't suggest it (maybe if someone else does).  Or, maybe I will give it a month or two and try it again after they work out the kinks."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good but it's a little over priced for the food that you get. The concept of this restaurant is awesome and has the best service (probably the main reason I gave it 4 stars). The location is a prime location if you want to eat here and walk around old town later. Basically, go here if you want to be served by cool people but not really get the bang for your buck. It's definitely a cute date restaurant - great Moscow Mules!"}
{"text":"Even though I swore I would never come back to Culinary Dropout, I was in the area the other day and decided to give it a second chance. Again, I go to the Phoenix location pretty regularly, so I'd like to think my last experience was just an exception and not the rule. 
This time, our waitress, Addy, was so sweet and attentive, it was like a one eighty from my first experience. 
The food and drinks, were definitely on point, too. I ordered the Drunken Panda, whose calamansi reminded me of childhood drinks with my mom, and I later found out was sourced by vomFASS, a cool food shop around the corner. 
We also ordered the Thai Chile chicken wings, which were amazing, they reminded me a little of flavors I would find at a fusion restaurant and was a welcoming twist to regular hot wings. 
The meatloaf sandwich was just OK, their meatloaf is better as a standalone dish.The sandwich itself just ended up being a mushy mess of loaf and cheese.
For our entrees we ordered the trout, and the fish and chips. Both were cooked well and tasted great. The coleslaw also complimented the fish and chips quite nicely. 
Overall, I'm glad I came back and gave them a second chance; this is the type of experience that's made me a returning customer to the Culinary Dropout Phoenix location, it's nice to know Scottsdale can provide a similar experience, too."}
{"text":"Why do I always expect more from this place? There are SO many amazing Fox Restaurants in town, and this one is just limp... If you must go, do the fried chicken and keep your expectations low."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was a little drunk when I arrived, so the specific details of our dinner here aren't exactly crystal clear. With that being said, everything was memorably delicious .. As a table, we ordered the pretzel app with cheese fondue, and I ordered the grilled cheese sliders and fries. Sure, those are items that are tough to mess up, but I appreciate that these otherwise standard items were definitely done right. The bread of my sliders was toasted to perfection .. in addition the the cheese, there was bacon and tomatoes on each slider as well. My fiancé, who has had meatloaf in probably 100+ restaurants,  really enjoyed his meat loaf entree. Service was prompt, food was great, ambience and overall prime old town Scottsdale location was an A+, oh, and drinks were never empty! 

Definitely can't wait to go back and try some other items on the menu. The prices are pretty reasonable as well - another nod to my 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great happy hour and the staff is awesome. I generally sit at the bar and challenge the bartender to the guess that brown bag special game. The ramen is decent but if you really want something hearty, get the meatloaf. You will not be disappointed. Live bands on the weekend make the place a fun atmosphere to bring along some friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I we're exited to try this new restaurant we heard so much about... I was presently surprised, the food and the service were great, loves the olive, cheese and cold cuts platter. It can be a bit in the expensive side, but with trying."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location before and it was great.  But this time was awful! There were a ton of flies! I had about 5 bites of my food, but finally just couldn't take the flies all over. It was disgusting! I would not recommend coming here for lunch."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is another gastropub that has infiltrated Las Vegas. British and Irish food tends to be heavy and tend to pair well with beers. Dare I say that CD does not match any preconceived connotations, but instead take it to a new level. 

I had ordered the Fish 'n Chips ($19) and it was worth the casino price. With two other English Pubs nearby, I prefer this version. The cod has a lighter batter which is spiked with heat. Although the setting is dark, the crispy exterior looked to be tinted in red. A taste of Tabasco laces the shell and lends an enjoyable characteristic profile. The side of coleslaw was also unique with a hint of citrus. I finished that first. 

As for desserts, it should not be passed upon. The peanut butter chocolate pie is better than the traditional banoffee pie. This declaration is not meant to undermine the deliciousness of the latter. I could devour a whole pie of either, but the chocolate version will always be first choice. 

The casual nature of the establishment makes me like it more. The dark tones and rich decor had me lounging in the banquette. I am also rather jealous of the staff. They are able to dress in their own attire. Although a neat concept, it makes distinguishing them rather difficult."}
{"text":"Wife and I went there on March 25th after a concert at The Joint.  We ordered the Turkey Pastrami Sandwich and Fried Chicken plate.  Service was o.k. since it was a busy Saturday night.  Waitress was friendly and helpful with our order.
The sandwich tasted really good but the fried potato chips were cold when served and they are made on-site.  My wife's fried chicken was served burned and everything was lukewarm--chicken and the mashed potatoes.  We complained and (maybe the manager?) an employee apologized profusely and had another chicken plate made immediately.  The second fried chicken plate was a little better--at least it was served hot but we then discovered the real reason the chicken wasn't good is the oil in the fryer must be really old because even though it wasn't burned, the skin was really really dark and had that old oil taste/smell.  We removed the skin and the chicken itself was good.  At least we didn't have to pay for the Fried Chicken dish--thanks to the employee.  (Popeyes & KFC are better for less cost) So good service but bad oil."}
{"text":"Having plans for a show on a Friday is never easy, I get home from work, say my hellos, change my clothes, fix the face and hair. By this time I'm starving, time feels like it's flying by. We had plans to eat at a particular place but that fell through so Yelp came in handy once again. Let's eat at Culinary Dropout, we're going to the Hard Rock so it's convenient, I made a reservation just in case. 
So we got there about 7:30 and the place was busy but suprised to see alot of open tables (probably because it's such a big space). Seated by the kitchen, I got to watch the action. Everyone of the staff were working their butt off but it looked smooth and cohesive at the same time. 
Now I grew up eating pierogi, when bought costing about 50 cents a piece. I can't believe I spent 11$ on 3 pierogi! But they were so good, loved the little cauliflower bits, don't tell mom but I'd do it again! We also got the Prime Rib Dip with Chips and Onion Dip, also really good. I wish we had more time to grub out but we had a show to get to. 
Our waitress was great, loved the atmosphere. I can't wait to go back, I have my 11$ ready!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat and a few drinks.

Trendy spot to hang out with friends. They have a variety of different games like ping pong, corn hole etc.

The grilled salmon was delicious especially with the poached egg. The only thing was the portion was so small!!!! It was literally little pieces of salmon.

Overall, good atmosphere to socialize with friends!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.

Food was no better or worse than anything at average-quality restaurants costing 25% less. Concept, decor and beer list are better.

Service was literally non-existent.  Turned out the guy we had to keep asking for help was a manager.  He took the initiative to take the drinks off our check (before we had a chance to even consider griping about the service), which was nice.

I wouldn't avoid this restaurant if someone wanted to dine here, but I also would not take the initiative to suggest it."}
{"text":"We made two stops here during our stay at they Hard Rock. A late night dinner and a quick lunch on departure day. Here is a summary of our choices.

1) House Made Burratta - Pears, Walnuts, Balsamic, Grilled Bread

2) Roasted Salmon with Creamy Barley, Poached Artichokes, Grilled Asparagus, Mushrooms, Preserved Lemon, Chile Vinaigrette.

3) Fried Chicken - Honey Biscuit, Potatoes, Gravy.

4) Chicken Meatballs - Buffalo Sauce, Dolce Gorgonzola, Celery Leaf.

5) Soft Pretzels with Provolone Fondue.

I have listed the items from our most to least favorites. The Burratta was so good we ordered it on both visits. The Salmon and Fried Chicken were Solid entrees, worthy of consideration on future visits.

The Meatballs were hot, that's it, just hot. We did not taste any of the Vinegar or Butter that usually adds balance to a Buffalo Sauce. There wasn't enough Gorgonzola or Celery Leaf to cut the heat either.
 
The Pretzels did not live up to the hype I've seen on Yelp and other sights. The Pretzels themselves were Doughy and tasted more like Dinner Rolls than Pretzels and an unpleasant skin had formed on the Fondue. 

I also had a Cocktail called, Velvet Death which featured Gin, Absinthe, Velvet Falernum and Cointreau. It was appropriately named, smooth, but amazingly strong! One was enough to give me quite a buzz!

Service was fine and they are easily Wheelchair Accessible.  Culinary Dropout had both highs and lows, but the highs mean I'll probably give it another shot the next time we stay at The Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Love love love the patio.  The place is huge and there is a stage for live music, however that night we were treated to a 2 hour sound check 1-2.  I look forward to returning when there are actual live bands playing because this is a great setup.  We went on a Sunday night in early March, and it wasn't busy, but with warm weather on the way I expect that will change.

The beer selection is pretty good, featuring local brewery Joseph James even.  We started with a dozen oysters from their Raw Bar, which didn't last long with our group.  I don't know what I expected, but their oysters weren't good, they were great.  I ordered the Chicken Curry with potato, green beans, peanuts, mushrooms, lime & cilantro.  It's quite good, but if you're looking for spicy heat, this isn't that kind of dish."}
{"text":"I usually recommend this place to a lot of people whenever they are visiting and gush over the trendy atmosphere, the unique fruity cocktails and savory pretzels with fondue...

However I am so over coming here because they keep overcharging the amount I was supposed to pay, AND THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE.

Yes, the servers are all very engaging friendly and draw you in so much so, however they lack attention to detail when making the transactions for the payment... 

The first time they messed up my payment  they charged me twice over the amount I was supposed to pay, and only purchased a beer. I reported it and they did admit that they charged me over which I understood since they were really busy that night and may have swiped my card for the wrong order. Eventually they did credit the amount. It was fine the first time, and I had let it go,
 
My recent experience three days ago went well so I thought, I ordered the dinner for 2 because of the restaurant week deal that was going on. My server Franky/Franklin was super friendly convinced me that it was a good deal since I were to get an appetizer, 2 main courses, a desert split amongst 2 people for $44. The bill came out to $70 with my friend also getting a few cocktails, so we split it and with tip my receipt is about $40. 

Next day my card was charged for $66, and mind you I am a poor college student amongst many others l and was shocked on why on I was charged over the amount. I called about it to dispute it and the person on the phone lacked no empathy whatsoever, no apology, nothing sincere just said \"oh well it looks like we actually don't have your card in the system.\" She wrote down all my information said she would pass it along the manager, and that they would call me by the end of the night. 

Manager called me pretty late in the night apologizing which I appreciated but still couldn't find the transaction of my card on file. I explained to her that that I understood that people make mistakes however the night was slow, there should have been no mistake on swiping the right card for the right amount... 

So bottom line: Ensure that the servers know when to stop being too friendly and talkative because they can eventually get so distracted in the conversations, that they might forget which card is whose and charge you the wrong amount. AND I emphasize they have to pay attention to detail. Also try to have a sense of empathy when I am trying to explain nicely that what you guys did was wrong and admit your mistake. 

So yes is the food good to die for, is this a place where you want to show off your ping pong skills to the cutie across the room, and enjoy the hipster ambience of other college kids? Yes. 

But if you're a struggling person in college  who can't always afford treating yourself like me, where $20 is life or death sometimes in your bank account, beware because who knows they may try to rip you off and charge more than what you owe."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of the Hard Rock's dining options in the past.  I don't necessarily dislike any of them, but other than Nobu none of them have ever struck a chord with me and made me want to do several repeat visits or instilled any sort of cravings deep within, and I can't really afford to blow half a paycheck on sushi on a whim so half the time I end up down the street at Firefly before a concert.  

In planning to see Fiona Apple last night I was excited to try Culinary Dropout from it's positive reviews and creative menu.  Upon arrival I stupidly hadn't thought to make reservations and there was a 45 minute wait.   The hostesses were kind enough to let us know that bar seating was available and we had a seat long these long wooden tables with stools.  I found them comfortable as far as stools go (I typically prefer backs and armrests on chairs #chairsnob), my dining partner that evening found them uncomfortable as the feet rests near the bottom of the stool were set too low for her shorter legs.  The pains of being less than 6 feet tall I guess.  

We started by ordering some small plates of cured olives and grilled asparagus, as well as some jack and cokes (though some of the custom made cocktails sounded delicious, I'm generally opposed to spending $12 per drink unless it's a last resort or I'm only planning on having 1 or 2, which is pretty much never).   The olives were as expected, and the grilled asparagus which was served chilled with sea salt were very tasty and worth the $4.  Our first order of jack and cokes arrived with what seemed like nearly flat coke.  I'm not one for complaining unless something is egregious so we sucked them up literally and figuratively and let the waitress know for our second order and she very nicely and graciously went to the 2nd bar area for the next round and they were fine (and strong!)  

For entrees I tried the Pork Cubano sandwich which comes with a side of fries.  My companion ordered the Bistro steak.  Upon arrival I was a little disappointed in the look of both meals.  The steak was quite possibly the smallest steak I'd ever seen on a plate, though to be fair my companion was fine with the size and didn't even finish it (note:  women.  smh) The cuban was on some sort of regular sliced bread and not on a roll of cuban bread as I expected.  That chapter on cubans must have been after the drop date.  The usage of pork belly instead of a typical sliced ham was interesting, and the flavor of the meat itself and the melted swiss was good, but I did expect more out of it upon ordering.   I thought the pickles were too much on the sweet side and I prefer a more sour pickle with a cuban.  The fries were pretty standard, and the sea salt helped those out tremendously (as sea salt tends to do).  Naturally I cleaned my plate despite any flaws, so it wasn't bad, just slightly disappointing.

On an extremely positive note, our server (Dominique?  That's what the receipt says for Cashier) was fantastic.  Eager to explain the menu, checked on us throughout the meal and was efficient throughout.  

Next time I'd definitely try the Pretzel Bites and a specialty cocktail (or 3), but for now the Hard Rock dining legacy continues for me."}
{"text":"I would give it at least 4 but I'm not getting the scantily clad waitresses.  Sorry I know this a
Is a college area but i wasn't choosing to go to hooters and that was the vibe despite the fact that the atmosphere is more hipster then hooters besides that the food was awesome and the service was just ok which honestly the less of the half shirt girl we had to see the better. We had the Korean rib eye and the green chili soup.  The chili was good but I was expecting a more New Mexico type chili which it was not."}
{"text":"I am a fan of every Fox Concepts restaurant that I have had the pleasure of visiting, but Culinary Dropouts is one of my favorites!!  I love the cool ambiance (plush overstuffed chairs, purple walls, massive chandaliers), and the patio area is seriously awesome.  Their happy hour is great (try the Saurkraut Martini - I swear by it), and their food is amazing.  This GastroPub serves your 'typical' bar food - with a suave twist.  Try the shaved prime rib sandwich with a cup of delicious french onion soup to dip it in.  Or try the butternut squash ravioli (soooo yummy).  Everything I have had off their menu, from apps to dinner to dessert (the monkey bread is fabulous - and NOT just because it has the word monkey in it) has been mouthwatering.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Yummy! I love Culinary Dropout... This location is obviously more fun then the Old Town location. Most of the menu items are the same between the two... With the exception of my favorite beer (Fresh Squeezed IPA they have at the Yard / Tempe location).... And the kale / sweet potato salad they have at the old town location. I wish I could combine the two! Then they would get 5 stars from me. :-)"}
{"text":"The food here is seriously amazing.  For sure, you need to start with the pretzel balls.  I think the ambiance is fun and interesting, but it's definitely not a quiet place if you want to sit and chat.  There is a lot going on, and the music is a little loud for pleasant conversation, especially in the \"outside\" warehouse-y area.  But the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Bang for buck I was very disappointed. I ordered the ribs, the chicken sandwich and the burger as a group with 2 of my friends and not a single one of us liked any of the dishes, we spent over $120 worth and decided to stop by Dunkin doughnuts on the way home because we were still hungry. The ribs were extremely salty, the chicken in my sandwich was dry and tough (almost like a tire) and the burger was basically like a hockey puck. The hostesses are your typical ASU gorgeous college students and the ambience is cool too, but the wait staff have no idea what they were serving. I asked \"can you bring me something hoppy, anything IPA like?\" The server brought out a porter/stout and then when I said this isn't very hoppy or pale he came back with something which tasted like a budlight. Plenty of other places to check out instead of this."}
{"text":"Great location... Nice menu but it could offer more items... The name sounds so casual but the decor is to much... The bartender weren't friendly maybe they were just busy. I noticed that none of the line cooks were wearing hat or head neat... crazy me I always find hair in my food:( I didn;t this time thought or maybe was to dark?"}
{"text":"Really fun and BIG place. Don't expect to walk up and get a quick table if you go on a Thursday night like us. We had to get lucky to get our own table in the open seating area on the patio. It was a really nice area though. Lawn games. TVs with sports. Fun \"living room\" seating areas for groups to sit on couches in a circle. 

I ordered the meatloaf and it was PHENOMENAL. So tender and the mashed potatoes that came with it were so creamy and rich. 

As for beer, I got a Deschutes Black. They have a decent selection of beers but not a whole lot of them are on tap, so don't be expecting a yardhouse selection. 

Overall fun and tasty but loud and busy."}
{"text":"If you want to stare at cute college girls, you picked the right place! If you want good food or service, drive to Scottsdale or Las Vegas. 3 attempts and all we experienced was long waits, cold food, and bad service. As someone who loves the fox franchise, it's sad that their name is on this location."}
{"text":"Was greeted by the hostess and was seated right away.  Our waiter Joseph came over and asked what we would like to drink and then left.  Came back 5 minutes later and dropped off the drinks and then disappeared.  The coffee was cold and of course the waiter was no where to be found.  After getting up and asking for more coffee because ours was cold he came back with a hot cup.  Now the other part that wasn't pleasant was waiting well over 25 mins for food when it wasn't busy at all and we ordered French toast and a breakfast burrito.  Needless to say we won't be going back anytime soon!  Sorry but if you can't have good service and a little better food delivery time when its not busy I would hate to see it when this place is packed.  The food was good but the service just wasn't what we expected it to be for Las Vegas and for the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"LOVE this location, every time I come here, I get the best service. Not to mention how nice the ambiance is! I brought an executive from out of town here and she was very impressed. I also needed an itemized receipt a few days ago, and so I had to call this location to get one, Samantha, the manager gave me EXCEPTIONAL customer service. I really enjoy eating the great food here, and it is in an amazing location, literally steps from Scottsdale Fashion Square! Will continue to dine here often!"}
{"text":"We have since been back to CD, and were pleased with the service and the food was  great. Must have just hit them on a bad day the first time around. We will be back."}
{"text":"Very impressed. The food was great especially the pretzel fondue. The place is a bit loud when full"}
{"text":"I do like this place.  Ate there recently and was surprised.    Love the apps  especially the mussels.  Had a great waitress, Felicia, who was not only fun but she actually helped guide us with real thoughts and not just, \"ya its good\" when you ask about specific items.

Ill be back and want to try the ribs, couldnt last time because I was with clients and I like to get sloppy when I eat the ribs."}
{"text":"great place to go and just get some drinks and have a good time with friends. they have a happy hour that all aps are half off and they have games like corn hole and ping pong. they also have a photo booth that's outside so you can capture all your moments."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night, we on the patio overlooking Camelback.  It was a beautiful night.  Our server was friendly and had good taste in wine.  She recommended a couple of wines that we really enjoyed.  I wish I had remembered her name.  That night, we ordered the charcuterie board, chicken wings, and fish and chips.  I could go without the latter.  But charcuterie board and chicken wings were awesome.  I highly recommend them.  I think that was the best they had.  

At other times, I've had the hummus, pretzels and fondue, and fried chicken.  None of it was good.  In fact, food lacked flavor.  I want chicken to taste like chicken.  You know, when you don't want to eat the skin but it's so good.  The pretzel didn't taste like much.  It would have been better if I had picked up hummus from Trader Joes, fried chicken from KFC, and pretzel and dip from Auntie Anne's.  All would have tasted better and cost less."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this place is really cool. We had a great time with a large group, and it's cool that you can play corn hole and foosball. I thought the food was just ok, but it's definitely worth the trip for drinks and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"All in all this place was just ok.  When our party of 11 got here we were told right away we needed to have made a reservation and could only be seated in the outdoor area, which in my opinion is a cute little area if all your going to do is drink which we weren't.
We sat outside In hopes we could all get seated together at a real table.
10 minutes into our wait the male host/manager maybe, headed over and led us to 4 small tables apart from each other and seated us. The group of us took the initiative to put our tables together which quite honestly is something they should have done. The waitress Taylor was somewhat rude and seemed bothered by the large group and although the previous waiter had said he would give us separate bills she said she couldn't because it was too much work. 
Things to try if you do go here our the wings and artichoke dip the ribs weren't specular but the ambiance was great, just make sure you call first or you could be in for a long wait."}
{"text":"Enjoyed time here after the USC vs ASU game. Great beer selection. We shared the potato chips with onion dip (yum!) and the grilled cheese sliders (also yum!). Our server kept the right blend of leaving us alone and making sure we were taken care of. I hope to go again to Culinary dropout if we're in Tempe again, if only for the Monkey Bread. The couple next to us had it and it smelled AMAZING! We were just too full too order it."}
{"text":"Fried chicken dish was well done and juicy. Sides were tasty too. The sweet corn ravioli was a total rip off, 7 normal sized ravs for $15. I was upset about his because i specially asked the waitress if it was a generous serving and she assured me it was. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice, could see it being loud at peak lunch or dinner rush. 

I do not plan to go back. Popeyes fried chicken is just as good if not better."}
{"text":"Please don't make the mistake we, and the table next to us made, and order the soft pretzel balls.  They are underwhelming at best, and the votive? candle used to heat the cheese isn't hot enough to keep it from turning into a plastic consistency.  The broccoli was undercooked and over spicy, and the brussel sprouts also just meh.  I would however, recommend the beets as that was easily the best thing on the menu.  Skip this place, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great space! 

PROS
Valet
On Opentable
Great Service
Pretzel fondue - the best app on teh menu and we always get it for the table to share
Pierogies - crispy and with brussel sprouts as well
Everyone else seemed to enjoy their burgers/salads/drinks

CONS
HH - ENDS @ 5PM, that part does not make sense to me
Price of the food is a little high for the portion"}
{"text":"Never been here before but had always seen it and wanted to try. The atmosphere is very laid back which I loved. The drinks were great and the salmon was delicious. If you like salted caramel, you will LOVE their black bottomed bourbon pie. Our server was so sweet. I totally forgot her name but she had brown hair and it always smiling. She definitely helped make our night a good one."}
{"text":"Happy hour is very reasonable. Had a craving for the pretzel and cheese. BOMB! The only issue was we sat at the bar and service was a little slow."}
{"text":"After going twice, Cullinary Dropout is likely my least favorite of the Fox Restaurant Concepts properties. 

The first time, I at least got to laugh. I ordered a large-format Chimay Red Cap which the waitress was uncomfortable trying to take the cork out of, thus requiring the attention of an overly confident manager. As the manager was mid-sentence in his explanation of how skilled he was at handling the situation, the cork shot by my face and nearly took the eye out of another patron sitting at the table adjacent to me. (Which made for an uncomfortable remainder of my stay.)

That said, there are some tasty bites on the menu including: soft pretzels & provolone fondue and the pork belly Cubano. 

That said, the entrée's are sometimes less than memorable. I've had better short rib pasta, the beer battered fish and chips are okay, and I'd rather go to Lo-Lo's for chicken and waffles. 

Also, last time I went I got stuck at a small table by the door on a relatively chill evening and then waited 20 minutes for a waiter to show up. Service thereafter was painfully slow. 

If you're looking for a relatively upscale beer experience, I'd suggest going across the street to Yard House. If you're looking for a more wine oriented time, I'd recommend venturing elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had been hearing about this place for quite a while and finally checked it out for myself.  Interior is nice, trendy, and maybe too trendy if that's even possible.

I was surprised to see the menu consisted of really generic, run of the mill food. Sandwiches, soups, and some diner favorites like meatloaf and fried chicken.  

Started with the garlic hummus, which was pretty good, however, they give you about 2 cups of hummus to enjoy on 6 pita slices.  Had to ask for another round of pita bread since that got us through half of the hummus on the plate.

My husband ordered the pub burger and my daughter split an order of pierogi and grilled chicken club.  

Pierogi were (at one time) considered peasant food in Poland due to their affordability...that said the order consisted of 3 of them atop some really overpowering fraiche. Overpowering and overpriced.  

Husband enjoyed his burger and my daughter and I agreed that the chicken club was good....average but good.  

Finished the meal with a Smores type dessert, which was very good but was soon too sweet to finish.  

Perhaps these culinary dropouts should go back and finish culinary school to be able to create a meal that will truly pack a punch and leave a lasting impression on its customers."}
{"text":"Very good friendly service, nice atmosphere.  Not too noisy.  The Ribs and the Pretzels with cheese sauce were excellent.  Beer in a Bag was fun too"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE This place!  Scottsdale places are pretty hit or miss, in my opinion, but most of the things that come out of FRC is excellent.  This one is no exception.  Besides the $3.75 blueberry beer (which is cheaper than it is in Whole Foods, the food is wicked good.  There are so many things on the menu I cannot wait to try but the pork belly cubano was a must.  It was the best one I've had since I left New York and I've even visited Miami since then.  Great food, good prices, awesome wait staff.  There are a bunch of great reviews on here that go into more detail than mine...but all you need to know is that this place is great."}
{"text":"While we missed our exceptionally attentive and attractive favorite server, Kenny, we had this lovely lady Kandi took bitchin' care of us. 

First, let's discuss libations. We both went a little foreign today and my comrade decided to splurge on the El Matador. Her words: soft and smoky, just the way it should be. I? Well, I got the Drunken Panda which is a great description of how I feel all the time. Tangy, light, with a hint of Lucky Buddha, which came with half of a bottle of the aforementioned brew. Souvenir!

We started our culinary adventure with the prized winner of the meal, the pretzels and melty, dripping, delicious, sexual provolone fondue. 

Next, our main course both of choosing the Pub Burger with a nice side salad, was the epitome of a smorgasbord of Havarti, sesame seeds, BBQ, and meat. Truly an orgy or spectacular flavors. 

The final course. The most important course: #dessert. The s'mores, which were my choice, was a delectable blend of chocolate mouse and creamy, creamy, cloudlike marshmallows. With homemade graham crackers for that authentic crunch. The banana cream pie was silky in nature, drizzled with a creamy caramel on the bottom, and topped with delectable cinnamon whipped cream. The flavors, on your tongue, in delicious yet sweet harmony. Oh boy! 

That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you #cheatmeal."}
{"text":"Great food, I recommend the Pastrami Burger or the Fried chicken. Don't skip on desert, you won't be disappointed. located perfectly by the pool I'd recommend outside seating if possible."}
{"text":"One of my go to spots. If you like good food and an upbeat/fun atmosphere this is the place to go. They have tasty drinks and delicious food. The pretzel fondue is amazing as well as the turkey pastrami sandwich. those are my go to things I order...they never disappoint. Aside from the yummy food they also have games like  cornhole, ping pong, giant jenga and more. It's always a fun time and they staff is very friendly. Great place to go with friends!"}
{"text":"The food and the service are always top notch. If you have the chance to do the happy hour. The appetizers are amazing. Never orders Deviled Egg is a restaurant before. They are a must have. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a fun place to eat.  The food is good and the service is quick and friendly.  Great selection of foods and small but good ideas for staple meals.  Make sure to order some meats and cheeses from the list. Also, the pretzels are a necessity, do not skip these.  Food was good, but you could tell it sat under the heater for a bit.  There was a thin layer on our pretzel cheese and on the mashed potatoes, they should of been brought out quicker.  I had the fried chicken which had an amazing flavor, but could use more meat on the bone."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for months after hearing friends talking this place up! We went for our second anniversary, and sat outside. It was about 50° out, but they have a bunch of heaters and walls everywhere that blocks out windchill and the cold! This is such an eclectic spot with a lot of activities to do while you eat/wait, like ping pong and a bean bag toss. Food wise, I ordered a Caesar salad with no shrimp. It was really good, but definitely not worth $9. We also ordered the cracked bread as an appetizer which was AMAZING but there were only four pieces of bread which was surprising and disappointing, as I thought we were ordering a loaf of bread with olive oil and balsamic on the side (it's on top when it comes). But it was delicious! All in all, really enjoyed my meal but probably won't be back soon."}
{"text":"I love Culinary Dropout! This was my first time going there for lunch and other than the service being a little slow, everything was great! The pretzel app was on point and the MAC burger is still my favorite!"}
{"text":"First off, this is a very cool place.  They have huge, covered outside area with ping-pong tables, gas fire pits, sofas and, of course, heaters.  The managers did a great job hiring and training the staff.  Everybody is so friendly. Even staff who are not serving you will make eye contact and smile.  That is pretty rare.  I think they actually are having fun working there!  They make it such a fun place you can go there by yourself and have a good time.   Despite being a new place they really know   their menu and give great suggestions.  I  didn't listen to the bartender's advice about a beer and she was right, I didn't care for it.  Another bartender noticed I wasn't drinking it so he replaced it with their excellent Prohibition lager.  The trout is excellent.  So were the mussels.  The seared tuna salad is pretty good.  Our server said they are known for their fried chicken so the next time I ate there that's what I had.  I was impressed with how much chicken you get.  Huge pieces! Funny thing thought was they only gave you 2 tablespoons of slaw and a quarter cup of mashed potatoes.  Better than skimping on the entree!  The taters were tasty but a little on the runny side.  The biscuit was not that light and fluffy but did taste pretty good.  Interesting that the chicken has honey on it but none for the biscuit.  I probably could have asked for it though.  Only one complaint, which I mentioned in a tip.  I do not like valet parking and that's all they have. The parking lot is right behind the place!  Why would someone want to valet and then have to wait 3 times longer to get your car that just to walk a few feet over to it!  I must not be alone here because I used to park in a little shopping area next door, but they recently put up a sign, \"No restaurant parking\"  so I had to park a couple of blocks away in the residential streets behind the restaurant, which was also pretty crowed.  I wouldn't be surprised to soon see a sign not to park there either.  Come on guys, this is not the type of restaurant that should have valet!  You have a very nice, down to earth, friendly place, not some snobby place!"}
{"text":"Loved the pretzels and cheese dip.  Our waitress Felicia was charming and lovely.  Had a quick lunch after being at the pool all morning and it was perfect.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Had a great experience two nights in a row for a company sponsored event for a training class social mixer.  The food was wonderful and the staff was more than accommodating.  Our server was Adam and he was sheer perfection.  He handled everything with ease, all requests handled and even the most finicky were pleased.  I love that valet parking was no hassles as well.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  They have fun food like grilled cheese and tomato soup, salads, pasta, sandwiches.

Here's the reasons why
1) open floor plan w/ massive garage doors that open to the outside world
2) outside seating w/ fire pits
3) tasty and reasonably priced feel-good food [all meals are under $20]
4) attentive staff
5) LIVE music
6) chandeliers & comfy seating
7) raw bar and antipasto menu
8) Big Bar with bar seating

Totally going back. I went with some friends and one has already been back."}
{"text":"The ambiance & vibe of this place is amazing. Love the outdoor seating. I started with the pretzels and provolone fondue. It should be on your must try list. Moved on to the ribs as a main course. They were tender and the flavor is fantastic. The Cole Slaw was perfection. I finished with the S'more pudding and my life was complete. Service was great. Looking forward to coming back when I'm in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was so much fun! They have cornhole, ping pong, and shuffleboard to play while waiting for food and for after. The atmosphere is awesome. I had the fried chicken and it is a MUST HAVE. We also had the hummus, thai chicken wings, and brussel sprouts and everything was great. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The name is appropriate. It's exciting as you enter, but you quickly realize it's not a place to brag about.
The layout is fun. The dining area opens up to the infamous Hard Rock grotto/pool. Bold patterns and bright colors decorate the interior.
The waiter emphasized the \"scratch\" cooking that takes place in the kitchen, but to me, this is a vague, almost meaningless term. Maybe this is Dropout's way of justifying a bland menu of soups, salads, and sandwiches.
My seared tuna salad was good, but just good, and probably not good enough for the price I paid.
I think if I was partying in the pool, I would love the convenience of this food. Or maybe I would enjoy just witnessing the debauchery. But saldy, the pool was closed, and I could only indulge in the conversation at my table."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  Sitting outside with killer Apps, great drinks, and service with a smile. I recommend the Seared Ahi Salad, it was Amazeballs.   They had Deviled Eggs and Grilled Cheese Sliders!  Don't miss this spot.  Seriously"}
{"text":"I am not a fan. I was interested to try it after hearing good things about it but the whole time I had 3 thoughts. 
1. Why is everything so damn expensive 
2. Why is the service so terrible 
2. Why do the employees have so little clothes on

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend before the QOTSA concert a few weeks ago.  Decided to take one of his adderall and forgot that a side effect is not having an appetite and basically feeling all jacked up on Mountain Dew.

That being said, we ordered a few apps and mainly decided to drink our dinner.  For some reason I thought I would drink a few extra dirty Ketel One martinis like the good old days (before turning 30 and being a grandma).  That led to bad decisions like ordering oysters in the desert (they were fresh as flown in that day can be and I did not get sick so I guess that says something).  We also got the soft pretzel bites with fondue, a cute little cheese container of sorts with a heat source underneath.  My bf also got the charcuterie plate.

Dana took care of us and probably thought I was a freak because of my adderall induced nausea and indifference to food.  

Definitely a casual spot with quick and tasty food and stiff drinks.  I would go back next time I am at the HRH."}
{"text":"Not so much.  They really don't like regulars.  It's expensive for a beer, and the food is just ok.  Many more places in Tempe will treat you better than here.

Numerous occasions bringing friends here and waiting way too long for a table when plenty were empty.  Hostess just forgot about us."}
{"text":"The $2. Bread and olive oil is fantastic! My company and I decided to nosh on cheese and cured meats. Delish! San Daniel Proscuitto (is that spelled correctly?) is awesome, just melts in your mouth. The serving size is large and delicatly sliced thin. I don't recall the cheese but the 3 we had were very good. We topped it off with a side of olives and a glass of red wine. Service was fast and efficient.  This place we packed out on a Monday night, that alone should tellyou something about the place. We were full and satisfied but I wanted dessert.  I ordered the chocolate cake to take home and it reminded me of a sheet cake you would pick up at the supermarket for a kids birthday.  I held back on a starfor that :( This place had a funky, modern, rocker feel.  Good for friends getting together or a first date. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here after a work meeting with a large group of coworkers. Very friendly and quick service! Excellent happy hour menu lots of options and very very yummy. I will definitely be back sometime!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Burger is the bomb, went back again and had the breakfast special which was also great. I would eat there every weekend if I could. Cool atmosphere friendly staff prompt service."}
{"text":"First time diners at Culinary Dropout.  Our server Luke was awesome!  Very knowledgeable, great recommendations, very attentive and just an all-around good guy.  Food was great, from fried chicken to meat loaf to the meat/cheese trays.  Don't forget the pretzels & provolone fondue dip."}
{"text":"[First time Out-of-Towner for Spring Training]

Hipster's Only, should read the sign outside of this place.

All the fellas had plaid on and all the girls were hipster/clubby as AZ seemed to be. Great vibe...they definitely were going for a SF look and feel. The huge chandeliers had me entranced. I absolutely loved the Hodge podge of furniture at all the different tables. The dark purple wall colors gave the place a gloomy, hipster vibe...

You know how someone keeps talking about something after it's happened...well I was that person!! Thanks to Culinary Dropout I've been tainted with the BEST Monkey Bread to date!!

This place was crackin' on a Saturday night. Being a newbie to AZ, we had no idea where we should eat, but the name in itself is pretty awesome. Culinary Dropout...hmm, since they dropped out should I trust it?!?

I'm glad we sauntered in, even though it was a 30+ minute wait...I'm glad we roughed it out! We ordered a drink at the bar to kill the time. The girls loved the 8% Blueberry Cider. I went for the usu, Coconut Ciroc and RB. 

Finally, we were seated. Our server was so busy, we had a pseudo server for a little bit, he brought us waters and our menus. Then sauntered over Jameson, our fun waiter. Fun guy, very entertaining.

We stared with the Pretzel bread & Provolone Fondue and an order of oysters (or something slimy in a shell).  The pretzel nuggets of goodness were tasty, lightly salted (I wiped all mine off). The provolone came in a cute little caldron looking thing...the texture was smooth and creamy. I loved the complimentary taste of the cheese to pretzel. The cheese wasn't overbearing, as many fondue types can be. According to the girls, the oysters were good...I'll take their word for it.

I ordered the Breaded Shrimp Caesar Salad (thanks Lent). I was pleasantly surprised by the dish. The breaded shrimp seemed on the smaller side, I almost mistook them for croutons. The flavor was good, as was the dressing they use. The portion was huge, as was the flavor...so I was a happy camper. I cheated and took a bite of the meatloaf, which was fantastic. Who doesn't love comfort food?!? The Asparagus salad was wimpy and I felt bad for my friend who ordered it...it was weak for sure!

I'd been waiting all meal for the desert. Monkey bread is top of the food porn chain. I was giddy like a 5 year old school girl! This warm desert was so good, I can barely describe it. Perfect pillows of sweetness, but not too sweet, with a hint of cinnamon. Buttery and light, but full of flavor, this desert was ON POINT! The ice cream was served in a separate dish, so it didn't melt because of how warm the monkey bread was, well played CD.

I'm glad they dropped out of culinary school!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the restaurant is so well decorated. I really love this place. Try the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Ate here cuz I thought the name was cool. Got the ribs and I was floored by how damn good they were. Get them you will thank me!"}
{"text":"Well I love the atmosphere of this restaurant.  This is only the second time I have been here for brunch. The first time was almost a year ago and we had a similar experience but not so important that I felt the need to say anything.  After all it get's great reviews and mine may not really make a difference.  The similarities in the two visits were that it took a long time to get our food.  Today it was almost an hour. We started to ask the waiters assistant at about 40 mins how much longer it would be. Then the waiter came over and apologized as the kitchen was backed up.  Later, the manager came over to apologize but made no attempt to make any amends.  Then we got the food which was delivered cool to lukewarm in temperature (which made some feel it had been waiting awhile before it was delivered)  Again, talked to the waiter who then I assume made some appeal to the manager on our behalf, but I don't know for sure.  He did offer us a complementary desert but we declined. I don't anticipate going back again.  Plenty of really great restaurants with great food and atmosphere who have a better handle on customer service.  I really want to like this place more. I hope your experience is not ours."}
{"text":"Everything I tried here was delicious! Fried chicken is great, as is the crispy shrimp Caesar salad. Drinks are a little on the expensive side- $6 for a beer! Cute atmosphere and a nice patio with heat lamps."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is very cool; I really liked the layout and the decorations. Friendly staff as well. Had a good variety of drinks and food and their specialty house drinks were what we tried and they were good. Had the provolone fondue with pretzel bites, which were absolutely delicious. Perfect combo. The entrees are a lot of common foods, the only reason I did not give four stars since a lot of it were things you could get at a lot of places, they just had their own twist on it. We had the ribs, and the honey fried chicken. Both were good, but again  both common plates you can get a lot of places. Had dessert which was really good, recommend checking that out. Not a very expensive meal, good place to stop in and enjoy some drinks and apps."}
{"text":"I just don't get the high ratings for this place, it's the second time I have been here and the second time I have been underwhelmed.

We pretty much ordered everything on the antipasta menu, the only real standouts were the deviled eggs and the prosciutto, everything else you could get at the deli counter in your local supermarket.

For the entree I had the chicken club sandwich...

Now, time to stand on my soap box, if you are going to do basic food, but charge a non basic price, it better be good food, sadly, Jack in the Box makes a better chicken club, then they DON'T pile an ice cold bunch of ham on top of the piece of chicken, which in this case came from a small chicken, not good.

The sides, how can I put this, they were straight out of the US Foods/ Sysco catalog, open the tub, and serve, for a premium bar charging semi premium prices, the whole thing just stank of lazy cooking, take pre-prepared food, heat and serve.

The service was okay, friendly, not quick, but always a smile at least."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish & chips I have had.  Deviant Behavior drink is awesome. It will creep up on you!"}
{"text":"We were there during a busy time of the year which may account for the sketchy service and inconsistent quality.  We loved the pretzel bites.  Yum and just what you need when you are bit hungry. The kitchen was slow.  My sandwich was light on meat (the grinder) while my husbands was really heavy on the meat.  But, we're fans for sure!"}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary's!  And if you haven't tried the Turkey Pastrami on a Pretzel roll with cole slaw, you are MISSING OUT!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout in Tempe is beautiful - a really nice space. Busy even on a Wednesday evening. The staff was incredibly friendly. 

The fried chicken was probably the best or next to the best I've ever had, all time. It was amazing. Everyone else I was with loved their food. I also thought the grilled cheese sliders were great. They didn't try to over-fancify them. Just good, traditional grilled cheese. 

It is a bit overpriced for what it is, but oh well. The menu didn't note that it was grass-fed or organic or anything, so I am not sure what kind of chicken it is to be so pricey. 

It is a great atmosphere and delicious. I will definitely go back. Maybe next time 5 stars. I think they are still getting ramped up - I asked for a box and they threw away my food. They did make a completely full new meal for me and the waiter was super nice about it. The valet also took a pretty long time."}
{"text":"This place is great for any occasion! The music is fun the servers are dressed casually (good for them) I thought it was cute! And the decor is fun and contemporary and random. The food was 4.5-5 star quality. We got the jambalaya split, but really it was enough food for one. And the pretzels which are just enough to split. I highly recommend both choices they were delicious. Our server was great as well. I already am planning my next trip back for drinks and to try the raw bar"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had while in Scottsdale. The atmosphere and decor are fun, beautiful, and trendy.

We had a large group of 10 so I'd definitely recommend making a reservation for a larger group. Our waiter, Trevor, was so sweet and pleasant and super attentive despite having several other tables to attend to.

We started off with a few snacks and the Korean style Brussels sprouts are seriously to die for. We also had some awesome deviled eggs and jalapeño cornbread. There was a good size cocktail list and our waiter also made great cocktail recommendations. We were in town for a bachelorette party so he brought us shots and was even accommodating enough to bring a virgin shot (aka lemonade) to the expectant mother in our group. 

It was an awesome dining experience and really amazing service - I'd recommend this place to anyone! So good!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Culinary Dropout because of the great reviews. The experience did not disappoint! The atmosphere is so much fun, whether you're there for drinks or dinner. Personable staff, amazing food (get the pretzel fondue and monkey bread!), yummy drinks (bacon Bloody Mary is delicious) and just an overall fun place to be. Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"service is very mediocre and food is decent....last visit i had one of the saltiest french dip of my life....."}
{"text":"The monkey bread was the best part of our time at this place. The drink I ordered I really didn't like, it was way too strong and bitter. I wish I remembered the name and it looked very nice. Best part of the night for sure was the dessert that was served warm with ice cream on it. 
The restaurant is completely open to the outside and it was very nice to sit outdoors. It's located near the pool and we were there at night so unfortunately didn't see any hot bodies but now I have a reason to come back for lunch. I also recommend making a reservation because it was very busy in there for a midweek."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by this place. Their pretzels and cheese fondue were delicious but everyone found their entrees to be mediocre. I got the fried chicken and it was fine, nothing special. Not a terrible experience but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"STUFFED!   Omg!   I used to work for Whole Foods as a cheese specialist and I make a killer cheese tray....but their cheese and meat tray is bonkers on point and the fresh cold seafood platter is epic with the BEST cocktail sauce I've ever had in my 35 years. We also ordered steak and pork belly nachos.  I was about to pop the button on my jeans I was so stuffed but we ordered the popcorn and monkey bread to finish off all our dishes and cocktails.   What a great night!  The chef swing by our table and the servers were amazing.  I'm really excited to go back!  I'll just get booze and that cheese tray and cold seafood tray next time again no question!"}
{"text":"I have a list of places I'm going to check out over the next few months. Culinary dropout was first or second on the list. They surely didn't disappoint and most reviews proved true. We went during lunch and after college graduations so it was kind of busy. Nevertheless, service was great, friendly staff who were very attentive, and a great atmosphere. They have a stage in the corner for live music. I'd definitely go back and see what that's like. 

We had pork belly nachos and a pub burger. Homemade chips and pulled pork were great. All the cheese settled on the bottom chips and we all know what cheese is like once it's cold...no bueno! The burger was good. I asked for medium well and it came out a little under cooked for my liking. They made me a new one! They surely have my vote."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and a few friends to celebrate my co-workers birthday. I give the place 3 stars due to the fact that for starters, their bar has no blender and the food was good but not exceptional. I liked the atmosphere which had a nice decor, beers ordered in cans are wrapped in brown paper bags, which is pretty cute. 

We ordered a bunch of different stuff to share. The shrimps were delicious! They were large and juicy cocktail shrimp. My boyfriend doesn't particulary like shrimp, and he enjoyed them and had a few. I really liked the pretzel and cheese appetizer, I actually couldn't get enough of them. 

I didn't order a main dish because I wasn't very hungry, but from the looks of my friend's meals, they deliver generous portions and they said it was \"good.\"

I'd come back if I was in the mood for beer.

One more note, the restuarant has an outdoor area that was closed when my friends and I came. It looks like a nice, cool spot to hang out on a summer night to just hangout with friends. I'd like to come back and hopefully up the rating of this place."}
{"text":"We went here for a girls night to celebrate a friends birthday! Live music and good food.. The raw oysters and mussel were great! We all ordered different a thing including the rainbow trout, fish and chips, and the steak! The monkey bread was really good! Highly recommended if u want a laid back dinner with good food!"}
{"text":"\"Slow\" is the word that comes to mind when I think of Culinary Dropout.  I was staying at the Hard Rock and after a couple of trips here I began to see the pattern.   

The food is fine.  The grilled cheese sliders, house made chips and dip, chicken wings, salads, Cap'n Crunch french toast all hit the spot.  In fact, I really could go for more of that french toast right now!  

They had a nice drink selection too.  The Pistols at Dawn and the Manhattan were great concoctions that didn't skimp on the alcohol.  

Sadly, I gotta knock off a couple of stars for the service.  It's friendly enough, but was just excruciatingly slow.  It took a while for a server to come around at all, and when they did, return trips were scarce.  Just paying the bill took about 10 minutes after we handed our cards over.  I even saw a party sitting next to us, their table empty, just get up and walk away.  A few minutes later, a waitress comes by with a tray of beers asking where they went.  Maybe they were just short staffed that weekend.  

tl; dr - Good food and drink, fair prices.  Hopefully you are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"I survived through a 9-month hellish short sale process just to live closer to the numerous eateries that engulf this area.  So, \"Hello, Culinary Dropout, we are both new to the neighborhood.\"  

To be honest, I wasn't expecting a lot from the new Culinary Dropout because the original one on Camelback did not impress me that much.  (There is a certain smell to it that just does not work for my senses. Sorry!)  BUT, the new one is BEAUTIFULLY renovated with a fun atmosphere and is quite aesthetically pleasing in every way.  From the game area outside to the warmly lit dining area inside, the new Culinary Dropout mixes Olive 'n Ivy's charm with the Vig's outdoor concept.  

The Yard will soon become the \"go-to\" place for those who need a break from the reality that is happening outside the fence.  

The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of a solid 5 stars is because it does not deserve it yet.  I have been to the Culinary Dropout for the last two days just to give a quick and fair assessment, and the timing of the food is not all there.  I understand that your name implies you dropped out of culinary school, and it is my fault for going to eat at your place despite this issue.  

However, you cannot serve me cold food.   

The first day, I ordered three items from the appetizer section, the fried chicken platter, and the meatloaf dish.  The entrees and the appetizers came out about two minutes from each other.  The mashed potatoes and the biscuit were cold while the fried chicken was hot - indicating that the side dishes were just sitting there waiting until the chicken was deep fried.  

The second day, I sat at the bar to get the feel of that area, and the appetizers took FOREVER to come out.  How long does it take to warm up some pretzels and melt cheese in a bowl?  Apparently, it takes about 45 minutes to an hour.  The bartender (who was awesome) felt bad, so he entertained me for the time being.

Overall, the food is a solid OKAY.  Food was never Fox Concepts' best trait in comparison to the better restaurants in the area, but I know that the company focuses on creating delightful hangout spot for its patrons.  I will definitely visit again soon to see how they progress through the upcoming months."}
{"text":"Had heard some good things about this place so we decided to stop by while in Vegas.

The pretzel fondue came highly recommended so we gave it a go. Frankly it tasted like soft pretzel bites dipped in milky nacho cheese more than a fondue. 

I usually go with the yelp highlights, but in this case it was the fried chicken and it sounded a bit heavy at the time. I decided to go with the chicken sandwich (I believe it was on a focaccia roll). It was relatively good, but not particularly memorable. 

All in all, the meal and the service were ok, but nothing stood out.

Given the massive amount of dining options in Vegas, I'm unlikely to come back under my own volition, but I wouldn't be opposed if a friend was set on going."}
{"text":"Y'all.  The food.  
So we had some errands to run in The Domain, and passed this place along the way.  It didn't look like our scene, so we kept walking.  After the errands, we were strolling, looking for noms and decided to stop.  We are SO GLAD WE DID!  There were so many plates we wanted to try, we just started with apps and a meat/cheese board and went from there.  

The meat was outstanding.  I have a New Yorker on my hands, who swears he can't find good \"deli\" meat and this met his standards and then some.  The cheese was also delicious and delightful!  I also had to add the deviled eggs because...deviled eggs.  Those did not disappoint either.

We shared the Soft Pretzels with Fondue and Pierogies.  I kinda wished we hadn't gotten the pretzels, simply because those are on a lot of menus around town, but they were good nonetheless.  We make pierogies at home, and these were definitely up to par too.  Both sauces for each plate were amazing.  Do you get it yet that we liked this place?!

Finally, we topped everything off with the monkey bread.  Warm, gooey, sweet monkey bread.  Served with fresh vanilla ice cream (yes, you could see the bean specs in it)!  Hot apples on the bottom, don't GET ME STARTED!

The drinks were delicious too.  I had a mule and my boo had one of their specialty drinks - I'm pretty sure it had 3 types of rum in it, but it literally just tasted like iced tea.  Mmmmhmmmm!  

Finally - the service.  Our waiter was so accommodating, made awesome recommendations, and was SO attentive.  We were thoroughly impressed.

We cannot WAIT to go again and try more goodness!!"}
{"text":"Dakota, you know the food is bad here, why would you ever eat here again?  Great question, I am so glad you asked.  Having been here a couple times and been disappointed I had never intended to give it another chance, as Sam Fox restaurants are always guaranteed to underwhelm and chains should be avoided when possible.   A friend had a birthday party and it had been at least a 1+ years since I had been, so I went in with an open mind about giving it one more shot.  A friend had a birthday party there (unfortunately I could not talk them into changing the venue) after being handed a bunch of lemons it was time to make lemonade

The evening started off somewhat promising, they actually had a craft cocktail list (trying to capitalize on the craft cocktail craze and actually doing it well are two different stories) and the Mrs went with their modified version of a French 75 (very modified) which was Aperol, Strawberry infused simple syrup, gin, sparkling wine, and I believe lemon or lime, which was drinkable but a touch light on the gin, I went with a Perfect Martinez - My criteria for this selection was the products involved:  Miller Gin (excellent) Dolin Dry Vermouth (excellent) Carapno Anticia (excellent) and orange bitters (as long as you buy decent bitters or make your own you are fine here) and what came out was a slightly orangeish martini - a bit sweet and orangey but certainly drinkable.  That combination of ingredients in almost any ratio is probably decent.  Looking at the rest of the cocktail menu everything looked overly sweet and unbalanced but I could not resist the compulsion to confirm what I already knew and against common sense went with a Singapore Sling.  Which was super sweet bright red, wrong glass, wrong garnish, wretched drink - so in conclusion stick with items in a bottle here, the cocktail menu is for looking at not ordering from

Onto the food:  The soup of the day was Chili, which was salty to the point of inedible, the fondue pretzel with cheese dipwas up next, the pretzel quality was very poor, cardboardish and bland with the cheese tasting very processed. 

We ordered charcuterie for our meal (as we suspected the food would be bad - and the charcuterie at Arrogant Butcher [another Sam Fox restaurant] is solid) and that was delivered to the other end of our table (large group) so by the time they figured out what happened they were going to bring out the same order to us [because of their mistake], with the rest of everyone's main course, however the main's came out and still not charcuterie, so we ended up canceling that order (it was about 20-30 min between the mistake and the mains coming out without them correcting the error) We also got a couple of the mussel app for the table - which was fine, it is hard to mess mussels up, the broth was ok nothing exceptional

So after about 2 hours in with very little eaten or to drink other than water, a couple mussels, and a few bites of bad bread, and 1 ok cocktail - it was the most exciting time of the evening, time to go! The Bday Girl did have an excellent time which was the most important part

If you do have to go there, try not to eat anything and stick with beer or wine - and you will be ok"}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere! Relaxed enough that I felt comfortable bringing my 4 year old out with us to a late dinner."}
{"text":"Thanks to a flurry of $30 food credits, we hit Culinary Dropout on an almost weekly basis for a couple of months.

First, let's start with the pretzels and fondue. No, really, you HAVE to start with the pretzels and fondue. If you set foot in here and you don't get the pretzels and fondue, you are messing up. The pretzels are literally the best I've ever eaten - soft, airy and pillow-light.

Another essential bar bite on the menu is the chips and French onion dip, freshly made and delicious.

As for the entrees, I've stuck to the sandwiches and burgers for the most part, and I've never been disappointed. The shaved French rib dip on a soft brioche roll is exceptional. The turkey pastrami is zesty, flavorful and balanced (although the pretzel roll, while delicious, may be redundant if you've had the pretzels as a starter.)

Besides the regular menu, Culinary Dropout occasionally features beer tasting dinners. We attended one that paired a five-course menu with beers from local brewer Joseph James, who had representatives dining with us and explaining the brewing process behind each of their varieties. Seeing what Culinary Dropout's chefs can do with a little creative freedom cemented this as one of our favorite restaurants in all of Vegas.

Patio seating, along the Hard Rock pool, is amazing if the weather permits and the pool isn't full of d-bags."}
{"text":"we tried this place out because it was highly recommended by the front desk staff at our hotel. upon arriving, i realized that it was the old pink taco space - i absolutely love that space and the layout of the restaurant. the location itself is amazing.

it  was friday night at 8:00, so we were expecting a wait. we were told 45 minutes, which was fine. we ordered some wine from the bar ($5.50 a glass - it's $13 where we come from! what a deal!) and then wandered onto the patio. a busboy was clearing off a low-top outside, and informed us that we could have it if we wanted , as they were first come, first serve. so we ditched that little buzzer and sat right down! out waitress was super friendly and quick, which was nice. there was also a live band playing, which was pretty awesome.

my boyfriend and i both started with the french onion soup - it was good, but different than we were used to - it had more of a sweeter taste, but i still really enjoyed it. the boyfriend got a monstrous burger, which he said was fantastic. i had the ricotta gnocchi with sausage, which is amazing - it's in a super light cream sauce, and it was unlike anything i've ever had before - plus, it wasn't a giant bowl of pasta that made me want to immediately fall asleep.

unfortunately, we were too full to try dessert - i really wanted to try the monkey bread - hopefully this place is still around when i come back!"}
{"text":"What an awesome spot along the Scottsdale Waterfront. The best part of this place is the vibe. The inside is open to the outside and the decor is really cool and unique but laid back. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful evening. My Fish n chips were good not great, but trout and fried chicken and the Mac burger were very much enjoyed by the rest of our party. And of course there's the pretzel fondue appetizer. Do not miss this. Definitely lives up to the hype! The drinks are really something special here. Vast menu of unique concoctions and we all tried something different and enjoyed them all. Also had incredible service. Can't wait to go back here next time we are in town!!"}
{"text":"This is a mixed review. There were some things I loved at the restaurant and some things that were disappointing. Let's start with the things I loved... The pretzel balls and cheese fondue, our server, and the caramel corn. I could eat the pretzels and caramel corn all day long and we had a very nice and pleasant server. Those alone would make me rate this a four star.

Now to the reason I rated them two stars. I asked our server  for a recommendation and he pointed out a pasta dish he liked. He said to add the prosciutto and I took his suggestion. My cousin also ordered the same dish. I assumed the would be an up charge for the addition, but when the bill came I was schocked. The charge for the prosciutto was $7.00!!!! This is an up charge of 50% of the meal for two paper thin slices.  This made my lunch portion pasta dish $22.00. My cousin also had this ridiculously high up charge. Adding scallops or shrimp costs less then $7.00. Had I been informed I would never have ordered it. 

Before I had gotten a look at the bill the server came back and told us that he did not charge us for the iced teas or the caramel corn. At the time I thought he was being cool, but maybe he realized that he never informed us and was trying to compensate. Btw the iced tea was $3.25... For iced tea? Since I did not see sodas or tea prices on the menu I did not realize it, granted I supposed I should have asked, but even in Paris , drinks are not that expensive. We had three iced teas, had we been charged for those, we would have spent $23.75 on iced tea and four paper thin slices of prosciutto...

In the end our bill was $75. For a salad, two pasta dishes and pretzel balls... Actually it would have been almost 90 had we been charged for the tea and caramel corn... FOR LUNCH...... That is shocking.... Really really over priced and to not inform customers of a major up charge is not cool, which is a shame because our server was really fantastic other than that, however that was a biggie. 

I am going to have to eat ramen noodles for weeks to make up for such an over priced lunch... I am sorry to say I would no recommend it, nor will I return. I can't afford it!!!"}
{"text":"The concept is great. Who wouldn't want to hang out on the patio, play games and have some drinks?! 
The reality: Waitstaff is hired based on clothing size (nothing over a size 4) and looks. Which means, if they manage to get your order right, they will probably drop it at the wrong table; or dump the food and run, not bothering ot see if you have/need utensils.
Also do not have the audacity to be thirst. ever. There's no 2nd pint of beer/glass of wine/ice tea refill to be had here. You will have better luck finding water in the desert.  Lastly, if you make it here long enough to get dessert - If you'd like a clean utensil to eat said dessert you have 2 choices: 1 bring your own clean fork,  Or  put your hands behind your back and have your own 1women/man tarte eating contest. 

The food - Its hit or miss. The \"hit\" is firmly in the land of 'meh' and the miss, is when you start having that debate in your head ' should I send this back, or should I leave'; this makes the food feel very over priced and stuffy. Clearly we are paying for the eye candy waitstaff, not the food. 

I've given them 2 separate tries to get it right and they failed miserably on both, I'm out."}
{"text":"This place isn't my style. But, I can see that, for some, it's worth the visit.

To me, the place was too noisy. There was live music that was super annoying because there are no acoustics. The style of music was not something I would ever choose to sit and listen to. Noise was just bouncing off every surface. No way would this be acceptable to me as a date night.

The entrees were just meh. Not memorable at all. A bit pricey for the quality.

The waiter was great."}
{"text":"Casual and fun environment with great food and drinks at decent price (great value based on quality and portions).

I have here a few times for afternoon working sessions with coworkers. Since it is not their busiest time of day they are generous allowing us to spend a few hours \"grazing and sipping\" as we work through business plans. It's great to have the yard there for when we needed a break or to use game of corn hole as the tie breakers for the  decision of the direction of the company:-)

They have a good variety of mixed drinks and our waiter was good at proving suggestions. Our table found humor in the fact that their \"rotating tap\" was Miller highlife:-)

All of the appetizers we ordered were great: hummus, pretzels, and antipasto plate. I love the pretzels with cheese fondue. Lots of delicious warm pretzel balls and good cheese.

Parking can be tough at busier times. They offer complimentary valet (obviously need to tip)"}
{"text":"Really cool environment and great ambience. A little loud and the service is a little slow but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Empire building is a curious thing...there are always a bunch of supporters and camp followers at first...then the wind changes direction for a while and people begin to have their doubts about the empire.

Sometimes, actual revolution follows and heads (quite literally) roll!

I wonder what will happen to the Fox Restaurant Empire in the future?

Will there be a revolution?...will Fox launch a \"Death Star\" to destroy \"rebel\" restaurants?...will they change to become a representative restaurant democracy (electing a new leader every 4 years or so?)...or will they simply fall into decline and decay away, like the Romans?

For now, they seem to be riding tall...good for them!

Some of the Concepts are (it seems to me) more successful (in every sense) than some others...Bloom is disappointing in its execution, Modern Steak is just OK for the price, Sauce is pretty tasty and, in my opinion, Culinary Dropout is the best of the breed, so far (OK, I haven't visited all the far flung reaches of the Empire quite yet...you know the sun never sets on the Fox Empire).

The Beautiful Carin and I had dinner at CD again last evening, after dropping by Old Town Tavern to have a couple of belts, say \"hi\" to friends and watch people tuning up for the Scottsdale Culinary Festival (a Saturday afternoon debauch of the 1st order).

We have yet to have a bad meal at CD...esp. given the price points...and that always makes me happy!

Pub Burgers, Pretzel Fondue, Fish and Chips, Fried Chicken, Potato Chips (and you know I'm a sucker for fresh house made potato chips), Prime Rib Dip and rest have all been tasty, well prepared and nicely presented by very friendly and attentive wait staff!

What's not to like?

For me the answer is \"nothing\"...esp. when you add the lovely décor (it kind of reminds me of my own living room...even out on the patio), the ambiance and convivial atmosphere and the wonderfully relaxed dining experience at CD.

Last night, we took our time, enjoyed a leisurely dinner on the patio, watched people, chatted with our fellow diners and just let the warm, comfortable spring evening settle over us...in other words, the quintessential Scottsdale experience!

For that, I salute the Fox Empire...Pax Fox."}

{"text":"Four of us had dinner and the experience was horrible, nah, worse than that. We ordered food from the happy hour and regular menus. Skip the kabobs and meatloaf sandwich on the HH menu....close to inedible. 
Most concerning issue and what really prompted this review is the following. One of our guests ordered a burger which was undercooked and sent back....ok, this happens but the plate did not return to the table until we were ready for the bill! Despite \" it's on it's way\", several times, it arrived late enough that our guest could not participate in the dinner experience. Explanation, \" we were backed up in the kitchen\". Seriously, if you cannot accommodate this \"disruption\" in the kitchen you need to re-evaluate what it means to provide good customer service. Totally unacceptable experience."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. Not many options for my diet but I did like what I could eat. This is definitely not health food but everything was delicious. It's a great place to bring a group of people, they have fun dishes for individual and shared."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 45 minutes for appetizers that came out after our meal. Never offered refills  on drinks, had to go the bar to get sweetener because our waiter never came back. Music sucked, nothing like having the leader singer drop the f-bomb when you're having dinner with the kids. We will never be back."}

{"text":"3.5 stars 

Those of you from the Silicon Valley.. this place is like downtown Campbell on a Saturday night mixed in with some Los Gatos-esqueness
thrown in with some 90s jams (think Oasis, Beck) as ambiance music

1. when I think gastropub I think tavern...what I got was something out of Santana Row in San Jose, CA. 
2. Service was average 
3. Seating was fun (cushy chairs and sofas) 
4. The guy in the Ed Hardy shirt playing covers was really good 
5. The food: 

I got the onion soup which was super light...the onions were caramelized well and their natural sweetness came through (I usually like a more beer stout onion soup dealio but after a day's worth of flying this was perfect.

 I also got the artichoke salad which has more endive and asparagus than artichoke. It is a light salad.. the Parmesan cheese does not over power and the salad is properly seasoned. 

The BF got the butternut squash pasta which he thoroughly enjoyed. 

Other members got the fried chicken which looked yummy and the ribs which also looked good. 

Overall: 
Not a bad experience.... there are tons of heat lamps on the patio, lots of flat screens to watch games etc (in our case the opening ceremony of the Olympics). Their drink menu has some interesting items like bacon bloody marys and infused fru fru like drinks. 
Decent way to start off our first night in Az."}
{"text":"Love this place. This would be the place to go with a group of friends. Great atmosphere - fun servers- the different areas of the space break it up!  

We did an array of appetizers and a bowl of the broccoli and cheese soup! 
Array of Apps... Green chili cornbread, prosciutto deviled eggs, korean style brussels sprouts, pimiento cheese & almonds, and prairie breeze cheddar with bread for spreading. 

Stars of the show were the deviled eggs and the Soup! Although nothing we got was bad (the cheddar was not my thing ).

Check it out it is an experience!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and one of my wife and I's favorites. Had multiple things off the menu and the food is always delicious; chicken club is my favorite and best chicken sandwich Ive ever had. The pretzel bites with fondue is the best appetizer you can get, service is great and atmosphere is really nice as well. Sometimes live music is playing which makes the experience that much better"}
{"text":"Stumbling across this place was like finding a hidden treasure! We had been at the Hard Rock for a concert, and afterwards were feeling a little bit hungry and up for a drink. We walked past several restaurants before the smell of juicy burgers drew us to this one. The sign outside mentioned specials on drafts and we could see that they had an outdoor patio so we decided to try it out.

The patio was absolutely the best feature of this place! Big wing back chairs, fire pits, couch seating, white lighting, etc. Beautiful and so inviting! They had a live musician up on stange playing guitar and singing, he was really talented and was taking requests, it was a nice addition to the atmosphere.

We weren't hungry enough to order a whole meal because we'd eaten at a buffet earlier in the day so we ordered draft beers ($3.50 special) and their specialty - the soft pretzels with provolone fondue ($12). TO DIE FOR!

The service was good - our waiter was patient and attentive. We can't wait to return."}

I stay at Hard Rock often so it's nice to have an option on the menu that's relatively healthy. The fried chicken got great reviews, the burgers are delicious and the pretzels are yum but too much for 2 people...best for a table of 4. Try the homemade popcorn for desert- love it!"}
{"text":"I'd like to start by thanking \"Local First Arizona\" and \"Culinary Dropout\" for throwing a great (and free) grand opening party! 

For our appetizer we chose the Burrata which is a mixture of mozzarella and cream. It had a very mild flavor and a texture similar to ricotta, but slightly creamier. It was served with a grilled bread, diced pears, and chopped walnuts then drizzled with a bacon syrup.  I was not overwhelmed with this dish, and would have preferred a healthier serving a pears and more sauce to add additional sweetness. 

The entrees for the evening were the pork ribs and trout. The meat on the ribs was plentiful and tender and sure to satisfy the greatest of carnivores. Although, the standout of the dish was the barbecue sauce. It was deliciously spicy and sweet, finger-lickin' good. Barely worth mentioning were the lackluster fries and coleslaw. Both were just passable and definitely expected more considering the price of the dishes.

I have mixed feelings about the trout. It looked rather lonely on the plate, with a dense line of green beans and almonds accompanying it. It was slightly overcooked, with one side being nearly perfect and tender, while the other was slightly crispy and just a bit dry. This being said it was still quite edible and the buttery sauce accented the filet nicely.

We finished the meal with the cinnamon apple brioche and vanilla gelato. The brioche was served in a cool mini cast iron pan. It seemed to be immersed in cinnamon and sugar, and just far too sweet. The gelato was just okay and was one small sad scoop. Not too much flavor or sweetness here, and that may be a good thing. The brioche was definitely begging for a bit of mellow. 

Lastly, we enjoyed a couple cocktails as well. I had the El Matador and the Smashed Irishman. While I almost exclusively drink beer, these drinks were excellent and I would happily order them again. Both seemed to have nearly the perfect balance of sweetness, bitterness, and alcohol. My favorite of the two would have to be the El Matador as I am partial to tequila. If the meal were not comped our bill would have been exactly $100 (excluding tax and tip.)

Almost forgot to mention the venue, which may be the most appealing factor of all. It has a massive covered patio with modern decor, trees dispersed throughout, very nice heaters, and an assortment of games which included ping pong, cornhole, foosball, and shuffleboard. I could definitely see myself going back, brown baggin' it (the beer special) and playing some drunken games. Get it!"}
{"text":"So I love the grilled cheese sliders I've had in Scottsdale so many times. When I took a cab to their hard rock location I asked the hostess if they had grilled cheese. She said yes. Since I was alone and thought it would be faster , I sat at the bar. I was told they didn't have grilled cheese for months so I left . Never going back to this place. Don't they know how great they could be.  More like a barn   They should have made it like the AZ locations. Seventh st PHX and Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just had the Bistro Steak,damn good steak!

Great environment, good customer service from the host to the waiters.

I will return Culinary Dropout!"}
{"text":"Pretzels are excellent!!! The chicken is really good as well! My mash potatoes where kinda cold and was a little disappointed by the potatoes but everything else was good!!! Ambience was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation on a Monday night, which seemed necessary, and was seated immediately. The soft pretzel appetizer was delicious. The portions are generous. So many tasty cocktails to choose from and our server, Marv (sparkles) was very helpful/knowledgeable/attentive. Will return when I'm back in PHX and have recommended it to others!"}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed. My husband and I had been wanting to try CD, so for Fathers Day we made time. We showed up, many tables open, and it's definitely a great atmosphere. Then the waitress shows up, we literally JUST sat down-super rad promptness, but maybe give guests a moment to look at the menu? Then I ordered a drink, after she returned, she asked to see my ID (I left my purse at home). So we found a copy of my Drivers License in our email from recently sending to a realtor. Mind you; I'm 39 years old, with an 18 year old daughter. She asked her manager and he said that he couldn't accept seeing the license and couldn't serve me a drink. I get rules, I do, but I'm obviously over 21.. So! We left. If I'm being honest, I wasn't that impressed with the menu anyways and the \"anti pasta\" menu is cool, but the pricing is a bit much AND I never mind paying for good food. 

Needless to say; we won't return. I'm bitter about the carding situation and I sincerely feel the customer service is lacking in experience. This is a disappointment, since we're new to the area and we live and work close to this location."}
{"text":"Awesome service, friendly staff, and delicious food. Not to mention a badass atmosphere and stellar drinks. Meranda was my server and she was filled with info on the menu. What more could you ask for? Nothing wrong with dropping out if the food is this good."}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but there's something about stale airplane air that makes me ravenous...so naturally, the first stop after landing in very hot Arizona was a place to eat.  Truth be told, I was intrigued by the name of this place, but was even more impressed by the ambience and definitely the food.  

The space was huge and can be overwhelming, so we headed to the bar where full service and immediate access to cocktails await us.  To beat the heat, we immediately ordered a couple of refreshing cocktails and was completely satisfied by the pomegranate yuzu mule --- refreshing!  But what really did it for me was the \"after school special\" -  a concoction made with raspberry tea infused tequila, homemade ginger agave, lime, and modelo especial.  

The menu did not disappoint either.  We started with the prosciutto deviled eggs (delish), and the completely addicting cheddar cracklins!  My entree choice may appear to be plain but I can assure you there was nothing basic about the shrimp kale caesar salad that I completely inhaled, and my cannot-be-impressed husband said that the turkey pastrami sandwich was served on the best pretzel bread he'd ever had - [mic drop]!  

We loved it so much that we returned for brunch on our last day in AZ but at Phoenix location.  There are several locations in the area but you never forget your first love so it will have to be Tempe for me :)"}
{"text":"From the street when you're driving by at night, this place looks like the spot to be! It is so eye catching and the location is huge! After we parked and approached the building, I noticed three different names. I couldn't figure out if there were separate establishments and menus but we allowed ourselves to be seated by the first peppy man to approach us. 

We were seated right away with Culinary Dropout menus. Not much later and we had our blonde waitress asking if we had any questions. The menu was....rather boring, unexpected, and...lame. I don't know how to put it other than those three words because it honestly just didn't feel like enough options or descriptions. It could just be me...

Anyways, we couldn't settle on meals so we ordered drinks and appetizers instead. We went with the pretzel balls and cheese dip and buffalo chicken meatballs. 

The pretzels were fine and the cheese was just OK. The cheese was rather processed tasting and the meatballs SUCKED. I guess it was our bad for ordering chicken meatballs but ew...the outside of the meatball was overcooked and the inside was just a tablespoon of spices. Waaaay to much spice! 

We can't complain with our drinks. How can you mess up a double vodka with a splash of cranberry? You can't. And the Angry Orchard with Licor 43 and lemon sour was very tasty. If you like vanilla and apples then this is the drink for you! 

Lastly, the service was garbage. Our waitress was inattentive and during more than half our visit, she was seen in the corner eating and when she was seen serving, she was still chewing and swallowing her food. Gross."}
{"text":"Perfect bro-chill spot for times like when tommy broke up with the crazy chick with the cactus tattoo. Found out she liked hanging upside down like a bat in the evenings. She claimed it was all about restoring blood circulation but Tommy called it a deal breaker and dumped her then proceeded to cry for days. 

Like good bros We banded together and lifted him out of the pit of despair with buckets of kilt lifter, cheesy pretzels and about 30 rounds of bags.

Ergo, This place is good when drunk or entertaining, the menu is mediocre but slightly above par for drunk food. Not many healthy options but I guess they dropped out of culinary school for a reason. Fun bar atmosphere for the bros.

Also there's hella hotties up in here but they all just trying to score free drinks and bounce or they're inexorably torn between the two roided douchebags with tribal tattoos that she came with. They're mostly leading dudes on while super interested in some loser kid that works at taco bell."}
{"text":"I really appreciated the staff today! I was looking for a kid friendly restaurant where my son, my mom, and I were able to eat and celebrate my graduation. I made a reservation online 15 minutes before we arrived. My son is rambunctious and as a single mother, it's definitely hard to get a meal in sometimes. The staff was so kind to my son. When they asked us how our meal was they even got down to my sons level and asked him how his food was too (he's 16 months old and can't talk but it was still sweet!) 

He spilled water all over the table and they immediately came over to help out. My som threw his spoon on the ground and without me asking, someone brought a new one over. On the way out, a waitress stopped to talk to him. If I could give this restaurant 6 stars I would. Thanks for making my day!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for spring training. We were looking for something fun and casual. The Culinary Dropout is both with flair and delicious food. The 36 hour ribs were very tasty, as was the Korean Ribeye. Excellent food, great atmosphere for couples, friends or groups. We went on a Friday night. I definitely  recommend reservations."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch, haven't done happy hour/dinner yet but will let you know soon.

antipasta list to create your desired tapas plate, great salads to choose from- portions were OK. I got the prime rib shaved dip sandwich, unfortunately there was more bread than meat- words of advice- at least match it up to creat a balance. My friends had the filet- 4 oz- they should provide options (4-6-8), mussels were absolutely great- recommend definitely. Service was great and friendly. They also offer happy hour mon-fri 3-6pm, and nightly entertainment - bands, solo artist, etc."}
{"text":"Wow this location is huge!! The mixed drinks are amazing, the pretzel bites and cheese fondue were off the charts!  My chicken sandwich was so delicious and definitely a huge portion.  The french fries were ok, but everything else was delicious.  The service was really good, our waitress was super friendly. Pretty hip crowd, might have to bust out the cool kid clothes when you come in into CDO, jk, but the atmosphere screams hipster.  Drinks are on the pricey side but are made well.  Definitely check this place out if you're out in Tempe, it's in the perfect location to grab a great meal if you're thinking of hitting Mill Ave for a night out."}
{"text":"There were probably 4 different guys behind the bar today around 2pm that really provided superstar service. Maybe it's because I'm a server myself, but today at The Yard Culinary Dropout just made me excited to go to work. And I've been here a solid 6 times and the service has always been good. But today inspired me to finally write a review. Keep up the great work ;)"}
{"text":"Confusing that they call it the yard but it's an actual restaurant. Food and service were excellent. Hate that I am forced to valet though."}
{"text":"The food was terrific but the service was even better! Our group of 7 had a server named Martin and he was excellent. There was some mistakes in the kitchen but the food was still terrific and Martin made sure everything worked out in the end! The burgers were awesome and so is the environment!! Super fun place for groups."}
{"text":"We took my parents here on Saturday for Father's Day to try something new. We got there around 6:30 and didn't have to wait for a table. We got seated immediately. Now, I'm a nondrinker so I can't really rate the drinks but their cocktail list is insane. 

We started with the soft pretzels with provolone fondue which was TO DIE FOR. So delicious and flavorful. I recommend it to everyone. 

We also ordered some cheese and meat off the antipasti menu which was delicious as well. The cheese was very moist and flavorful and the capicola had just enough pepper to give it a hint of spice. 

For entrees, I ordered the short rib pasta which had delicious flavorful short rib in a yummy red sauce. It wasn't too heavy or too light. Just right. My boyfriend ordered the MAC burger which is basically just a glorified Big Mac only better. My mom got the smoked chicken salad and my dad ordered the coq au vin. Everyone seemed to be happy with their choices. 

We had to skip on dessert because we were so full after wards but I can't wait to come back and try some more delicious food!"}
{"text":"Culinary dropout has good flavors, but the wait for both a table and the food once ordered was overwhelmingly long. The decor is inviting and modern, despite its very low lighting. 

For appetizers we ordered the black mussels and burrata. The burrata was a bit stringy in texture, a little more than I would have liked, but the cider flavor really shined and complemented the green apple slices. The black mussels were nice, but the broth was the star, with an extremely rich and tasty flavor.

For entrees I ordered the korean ribeye cap, and was able to sample my family's orders. The over arching theme of the food was great flavors that were very interesting and tasty, but a little too much salt / seasoning for my liking. The korean ribeye was a good modern twist on an Asian style dish, but a bit cloyingly spicy. The bistro steak was nice, but again a little too salty. Both were a nice medium rare as ordered. The beer battered cod was nice and crispy, and the pork belly from the ramen was extremely tender.

The desserts we sampled were the monkey bread (baked fresh in house) and the black-bottom pie. Unfortunately the wait for the dessert took more like 20 minutes than the advertised 12 for the fresh monkey bread, but I'm leaning towards saying that the wait was well worth it. Both had great flavors and were not overly sweet. The graham cracker bottom of the chocolate pie was a nice touch to counter the caramel topping and fluffy chocolate filling. The vanilla ice cream nicely cut the initial sweetness of the monkey bread, marrying well with the cinnamon and warm bread pieces. Overall, the waiters were very nice and the experience in general was nice."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, fair prices for Vegas.  We took in a large group.  Service was great, drinks were great, food was solid and portions were large.  It fits in the Hard Rock as its a lot of fun to eat here. 
We didn't go out much, so it was great to be able to get something fun to eat without leaving the hotel."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner after the Magic Mike show and ordered the pork nachos and three different tossed, chopped salads.  I got the ahi salad and was really happy with it - delicious and nutritious!  Service as good, too and they let us hang out for as long as we liked.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys a great drink, an even better burger, and a bustling environment! One of my favorite things about this restaurant is that they have games like ping pong and bags (cornhole) to play with friends at your leisure. Another aspect of this restaurant that I enjoy is the decorations/furnishings. It really brings the restaurant to life. Apart from the environment, I would go back simply because my food was delicious. Not only did my burger taste delicious, it also smelled delicious! The portion size was perfect in my opinion. I am looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Hands down BEST Prime Rib Dip ever!!! Oh and the customer service here is exemplary!!!! Look forward to next visit!!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation at 7:30pm and weren't seated until 8pm, we could tell it was an extremely busy night so we were patient. When we were finally seated, the hostess thanked us for waiting and gifted us their signature appetizer (pretzel rolls and fondue!). 

Drinks were delicious, I recommend the any of the shandies. We shared a few appetizers instead of ordering entrées. Brussel sprouts were delicious, you can't go wrong with any of the cheese/meet choices, but unfortunately the wings were small and dry. 

If you're planning to dine here, definitely make a reservation! I was watching the hostess turning people away at the door because the wait was over 2.5 hours for people without reservations."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed yhis chef driven pub. If I was attending ASU this is where you'd find me for lunch.
I had their double cheese burger. Killer bun and the meat was perfectly cooked. I opted for the side salad with the house made ranch. Best ranch dressing I've ever had. Full disclosure I don't normally order ranch since I prefer olive oil and vinegar on my fresh veggies.
My lunch guests had the bowl if chili and seared Ahi salad. They were both impressed.
The decor is modern warehouse with the kitchen wrapped in glass. If I worked here is feel like I'm in a fish bowl. 
Super cool soot. Take your kid here when you are visiting the school"}
{"text":"With a few hours before our flight and hungry bellies, the boyfriend and I set off to find a unique place nearby to have dinner. I had overheard a conversation about Culinary Dropout with some fellow Yelpers and since it's a popular \"chain\" locally I knew we had to try. 

So glad we did!

The design was fabulous - a mix of industrial and farmhouse chic to give the space a super hip feeling. Complete with an array of game zones that included ping pong and cornhole. 

We opted for the charcuterie board as a starter. It was made fun by the unique way to order, very similar to sushi! Although I admit, I became a little overexcited and started jotting down way too many options. The BF reeled me back in and eliminated a few. Good thing too!

Between our cocktails (amazingBloody Mary btw) and Wings (damn that plate of wings is huge!) we were almost ready to Call it quits! But quitters we are not. 

For entrees we ordered the fried chicken and meatloaf - as suggested by our fab waitress. She did not lead us astray as both plates were fantastically delicious. Meatloaf was incredibly similar to my mother's. Coated in thick ketchuppy-tomato sauce its a perfect example of \"traditional\" meatloaf! PS - if you put BBQ sauce on your meatloaf you're absolutely despicable (love you!)

Fried chicken was up there on my faves. No where near Thomas Keller status but above and beyond your typical. 

If CD were to expand I to Bakersfield I just know they'd find success. Their blend of unique, creative and fun makes them a powerhouse restaurant. 

With that said - please come to Bakersfield!"}
{"text":"I've had good and bad experiences, so I give this place 3 stars. Some of the waiters & staff are pretentious and it gets really loud. I've also had very friendly waiters. If you want to see some cool furniture, grab some drinks, any maybe play some ping pong (if it's not too crowded...) it's a fun place. I like the location. Sometimes you have to park far away but everything is contained. It's definitely a unique building. The open bathroom mirror and sink design is unique."}
{"text":"I wanted to take my husband here when we visited Phoenix. I had been to the other location and liked it, so tried his new location....it was awesome!  The place is really cool and has an awesome vibe, with live music, good beer, and even ping pong tables and cornhole! I recommend the pretzel bites for sure! I had roast beef sandwich and my husband had the grid chicken. Neither of us were disappointed.  I will definitely go back next time I'm in AZ!"}
{"text":"Went there based on the hype that the restaurant receives.  We had an enjoyable evening.

We started with some of the house made chips and onion dip (very good) and some chicken tortilla soup (also very good).  We moved on to sandwiches (turkey pastrami and pub burger)  also very good.

They g=have a good selection of beers and some house-specialty drinks that we tried.

The atmosphere was very busy and LOUD.  It is not a place to go for conversations unless you like to yell.

I would highly recommend making reservations as it was very busy."}
{"text":"You must give this place a try. The food here is simply amazing. Very high quality made from scratch meals. The drinks were also very unique and complex. Awesome atmosphere with what looked like a nice spot to host a wedding reception. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and take some friends. It was busy but we had reservations which I highly recommend. Our server was excellent but my problem was the food we got and our bill. Our bill was close to $80 for 2 of us and all we got was 2 $10 cocktails, the pretzels and some antipasto which was the smallest quantity I've ever seen. I was very disappointed and feel like we wasted our money. We would have been better off getting a meal or each an appetizer. We also had to deal with people constantly smoking near our table which could have triggered her asthma. I was more than bothered by the smoke. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed on many levels and won't be back :("}
{"text":"I have a new favorite drink - the Home-ec Martini at culinary dropout. The food was good and the service top notch (thanks Brittany) but the martini(s) were great. The  pretzel fondue got us started and I would have that again but did I mention the Home-ec martini?  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Appetizers were \"lost\" with a mere sorry as an excuse and failed to appear at all. French fries soggy and cold, less than mediocre at best. Moscow mule is good. They have nice ping pong tables. I got the prime rib sandwich, pretty good. Asking for a napkin that was not provided at the start was a real effort for our server to fetch. Overall very unimpressed with the restaurant and the attention we received and would not recommend for sit down food service. If you are set on coming here, don't expect to get what you order, be prepared to wait a long time to be seated, and don't plan on wanting to come back."}
{"text":"Cornhole, ping pong, great atmosphere, and yummy food?! Sign me up! We were on a short weekend trip in Phoenix and a friend recommended culinary dropout. We went during happy hour and let's just say, they did not disappoint. The rave is the pretzel bites based on everyone's reviews but I think they are sleeping on the Thai chicken wings and house chips with onion dip. They were AMAZING and we had no left overs :) The fries with a side of ranch will never steer you wrong! I can't speak to the drinks because we got the paper bag specials...which was hilarious and questionable all at the same time."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome to have Sam Fox add this addition to the Tempe- Mill Ave area. I've been such a fan of all his concepts for years. We came here for a company happy hour and had a great time. Prices are above than what you are used to paying in Tempe, but hey... It's worth it if you are having a great time. We shared the fried chicken and it wS delicious and juicy. 
The only bad thing about coming here is the parking. You either have limited parking or have to pay for valet. 
Regardless, I would still be coming back to this fun and hip place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant on date night. Which to us with 3 kids is a special night!  We always try to a new place for date night ~ it's our thing! When we got there it was about 8 pm and we loved the decor and the set-up. Our waiter wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu. So we put our order in. He comes back and tells me my order is no longer available. We go through this 2 more times..Ugh just tell me what is available already! By this time my husbands food is ready and I haven't even had a chance to figure out what is available! Well I wasn't impressed especially since we weren't even offered anything for how poorly our visit to them was. Not worthy of a second visit."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! Awesome live music also. The only weird thing was there we were told they had no availability for another 45 minutes. We just went on open table and booked a table and were seated in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This was a great choice before the Rascal Flatts concert. Nice open atmosphere, live music, great menu choices. I had the fish & chips, she had the seared tuna salad. We started with the hummus appetizer and it was terrific. The live music was two guitarists who were very entertaining. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Service is great. I love the decoration in this place. But on a Friday or Saturday night its very loud and the band at 8:00 is horrible. So go before the band start. On weeknights they have excellent happy hour."}
{"text":"Want to take my girlfriend out for a special night so we stop at culinary dropout our server had a very interesting hairdo and she was very polite. The nachos there were zesty and refreshing slightly salty top with some pork very delicious much better than nachos I had at Gordon Ramsay. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to a friend."}
{"text":"So yummy and not overpriced. I suggest getting the pretzel bites and fondue for starters. They are delicious. The atmosphere is super cool and family friendly. There is also fun games to play like corn hole, shuffleboard etc. Overall a great place."}
{"text":"What can be more comforting than warm pretzels with cheese fondue dip! Such a great combination. Fried chicken dinner was really tasty, batter included buttermilk , cumin and other spices. But the extra something that made it really special was the drizzle of honey on top. Potatoes and gravy ok, biscuit was a little dry and slaw had a sweet flavor that one has to be in the mood for. Ribs were nicely cooked until tender and crispy shrimp salad was good. Great waiter, friendly. Nice time."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I eat here about once or twice a month and we always enjoy our experience. The ambiance is vibrant, the service is excellent and the cocktail list keeps our tastebuds buzzing. We have had the good fortune to become friendly with Cara, the manager. Each time we came in she would make a point to come over and say hello. She remembered little tidbits about us and she was always very genuine.  We are sad that she has left, but we definitely plan to visit her at her new venture.   We hope the new manager will be able to fill Cara's shoes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to drop in on a friend at Culinary Dropout and test out his new digs.  We left completely satisfied and wanting to try more.  We first tried the Burrata, a cream infuse mozzarella with persimmon, brussels sprouts, hazelnuts, and grilled croutons. As if fresh mozzarella isn't creamy enough, this just melted in your mouth. The roasted hazelnuts and crispy brussels sprouts leaves brought a delightful texture to the party in my mouth.  Our second appetizer was their infamous  soft pretzels and provolone fondue.  Delicious is an understatement.  The pretzel knobs were soft and airy on the inside, with a soft, chewy, shimmery outside. And the fondue...OH THE FONDUE... The provolone fondue to the pretzel is like a micro fleece blanket and a wood fire to you and I.  Let's just say I'm on a mission to replicate the recipe.  For entree's, we ordered the goulash and jambalaya.  Sounds ordinary, but Culinary Dropout took it to the extraordinary.  The spices were BAM! spot on.  The portions, well worth it.  Who knew leftover jambalaya would be so good for breakfast?!  I do now. We ended the meal sharing the chocolate and peanut brittle tart, a rich chocolate gonosh in a flaky crust sprinkled with peanut brittle.  Delicious.

We will definitely find ourselves back there to  try other items on the menu and more pretzels and fondue.  Cannot wait."}
{"text":"Culinary Drop out can be hit or miss.  The food is always great but the service can be either spot on or just a trendy pretty person who has no idea what they are doing.
They have flavorful and imaginative drinks but don't pick a favorite since the menu is constantly changing.

My fav things to order food wise are the pretzel fondue and the Turkey Pastrami.  The Fondue is a 100% have to order item, I haven't met a single person who doesn't love them.  The Turkey Pastrami is also a great item as it is inventive and never disappoints.  My secret suggestion is sub out the fries for mashed potatoes and gravy.  

Normally I give a Sam Fox restaurant 4 or 5 stars because they go above and beyond on service but CD is one that is definitely not consistent on service.  Also Happy hour is available in the bar only which is a HUGE pet peeve of mine."}
{"text":"Bumping this up a notch.  After attending a soft opening of their upcoming brunch menu including egg white frittata, breakfast burrito, and cap'n crunch french toast, and getting to know the GM, Chef, Somallier and waitress, I was really impressed with the pride they take in their restaurant.  The food is consistently top quality but the prices are much less than you would pay in fancier establishments.  They have TV so if the brunch works out you know where I will be on Sundays during football season."}
{"text":"I went here for Resteraunt week and I was very pleased, I had the Fried Chicken the portions are HUGE, But omg the cripsy skin was so good We had the antipasta which was very tasty too! The staff there is all very helpful with sugestions on the wines and what to order. As well as many other people have wrote it's a place filled with beautiful people and all dressed very fashion forward. Great energy and a fun place can't wait to go back......"}
{"text":"We went here around 10pm for dinner, so we had no issues with seating. To start off we ordered some capitols, bread with olive oil. The meat was very good and you could taste the quality. For our main dishes, javier got the prime rib sandwich and I got the Italian grindr. We decided to split each. The au jus dip for the prime rib was very good. I usually don't like prime rib because its too bloody but this was cooked to perfection and was still very moist. I enjoyed this sandwich very much. The Italian grinder was delicious also, good quality meats and the dressing was perfect, not too sweet. We were too full to try desert. They had a live band inside which we didn't mind but not cool for a first date, you couldn't here yourself speak over the music. I will go again,possibly for brunch"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious! You must try the bacon bloody mary...amazing! The meats and cheeses we ordered were fantastic. The 3 crab legs were ginormous and meaty. Or entree orders (egg white scrambles and grilled cheese sliders) were just as delicious, but the portion sizes were small compared to the hangovers we were coming off of. It is somewhat expected for a trendy restaurant, but it left us wanting more. :)"}
{"text":"The service is VERY unreliable, and don't bother making reservations here.

I made Mother's Day brunch reservations and we had to wait over 30 minutes past our reservation time. 

Additionally, the wait staff swore loudly in front of my young children. Any time they bent over to clean a table or set down a dish, their bottoms fell out. 

Will not be back."}
{"text":"Total fan of Culi D! Recently traveled to LV for a business trip and we dined here twice. The food was great, I tried brussel sprouts for the first time, and it changed my life. Thanks guys!  I really liked the array of drink choices, and the environment was perfect. Our waitress was a sweetheart. We did wait a while for our food, but we were not in a rush, so that helped. Now- had we been, I would have been wicked irritated to have waited so long.

Casual, trendy and priced right, I plan to go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Matt and Gabriel are the most amazing bartenders!  Food was great!   My Vegas trip is complete now.  Thank you for being so awesome."}
{"text":"We've dined at Culinary Dropout in Las Vegas, Tempe, and Scottsdale before, but we sat outside and it's always been comfortable.  This last Saturday night we went to the Scottsdale location and we sat inside because it's too hot outside right now (110 degrees).  Well, I will never go to this place in the summer again, because they did not have sufficient air conditioning, it was so uncomfortably hot in that restaurant we couldn't enjoy ourselves.  I know they can afford the a/c bill, so maybe they're just being cheap!  I couldn't wait to get out of there and cool down!  We did mention it to our server, but she just agreed with us that it was too warm."}
{"text":"Mecca filled with hotties. I had no idea Phoenix had so much to offer. Why haven't I been here before? Good Lord.

I walked in and thought,\" I have reached the holy land. This is it.\" Not only were there good looking men everywhere - and I mean EVERYWHERE - they were clearly hunting. I really have no other way to put it. 

If you want to meet men, go here. I mean, if you want to meet well dressed, well groomed, hot looking men, go here.

Culinary Dropout has managed to create an environment where drinking is not the end game. Yes, I did get drunk here. (After I met a lovely guy. But that's an entirely different story.) But there is stuff to do! Lawn games! (Granted, the ping pong tables were dominated by the 8 year old and under crowd, but, still.) 

There is ample seating (couches require reservations). However, bar stools fill up super fast. However, with so much real estate you don't feel like you're on top of someone if you don't have your own table. I can't wait to go back.

(4 stars only, as the food was 'feh'. I shared the tuna salad and had to go on a hunting expedition to try and find very much. The pretzel balls were yummy.)"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great!! Love the open air feel and the live music was a great touch. Came on a Friday and the place was dead... kinda scary for a Friday. 

The food was fantastic.... HOWEVER... in ordered the meatloaf and although it was delicious it was way overpriced. Adding another slice would've made it it a much better deal. The fried chicken is great!! 

Over all it could be a fantastic place!"}
{"text":"I am not really sure why I am not giving this place 5 Stars... I was in Vegas about a week ago and we were having a low key night after all day hangover's.... We were really hankering for fried chicken, so I \"Yelp'ed\" fried chicken and this place popped up not too far of a trek from MGM Signature Hotel where we were staying. I have to tell you the atmosphere was so relaxed, we sat outside near the pool at Hard Rock Hotel and lounged on the couches. They even have a Beer Pong table! We ordered the delicious pretzel bites and cheese fondu, which was a hit! But I have to say the Fried Chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy was to die for! This is one of the best meals I have every had on my trips to Vegas - and the prices were so reasonable! I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for good drink prices and some comfort food! What an amazing place! Can't wait to go back to Vegas just to come here :)"}
{"text":"Came here before a night out. This is an awesome place to have dinner or pre-game. There seems to be a lot of patio/outside games/restaurant combos emerging everywhere I go so no surprise when I was in Phoenix. Culinary Dropout is doing a fantastic job of being a restaurant and just a fun place to hang out in general. I had the ahi tuna salad which is usually a solid choice no matter where I am so I can't comment too much about this particular item. I wish I had more time to try other menu items but I was having way too much fun to worry about what I was eating. They have a surprise combo where they give you a shot and beer of their choice...makes for a very interesting night."}
{"text":"Pretzel fondue... butternut squash cannellone... the burger... all excellent!  Heck, if I was Cuban, then I would sneak into America just to eat the cuban sandwich at Culinary Dropout.  Total food porn here.

Thirst-quenching cocktails that satisfy even the biggest hunger.  !Esta muy beuna!  (I don't actually speak Spanish, so just pretend that makes sense... besides, my English is well-written).

The live music was a bit loud, so maybe we'd have fared better sitting outside... but it's just so damn cool and hip-looking inside...

Service is pretty prompt and attentive, which can sometimes be hard to find these days.  And any place that allows me to eat amazing food AND look at all the hotties walking outside Fashion Square Mall at the same time is a star in my book!"}
{"text":"First time ever ....it was awesome...trout...best I have ever had...service great...can't wait to go back !!!!"}
{"text":"We had recently visited this restaurant and we  weren't all very impressed.  We were invited to try them out again.  We returned today and got a totally different experience. A Very positive one!  I had a couple of snacks. The  Sherry glazed beets & goat cheese was yummy but l' d recommend ordering it for dessert and for sure order a side of bread with it. It is extremely sweet.   Next l had the prosciutto deviled eggs. It wasn't a slice of prosciutto like l expected but rather there were crumbs of grilled prosciutto.  There is a definite undertone of wasabi in the deviled eggs which was pleasant. My entree, butternut squash cannelloni was tasty! Homemade cannelloni smothered in echalotes \"bien suees\", julienne squash, sprigs of brussel sprouts, and don't forget the buttery cream sauce binding all the flavors together.  My hubby picked the fried chicken. I took a sample of the fried skin. It was very crispy and fluffy then it melted in my mouth. Tres bon! 
Staff gave us a warm welcome upon our arrival. Wait staff was eager to please and extremely attentive.  Culinary Dropout was a definite 5 star today!  Bonne chance
BTW, free parking is adjacent to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a most fantastic experience.  The location and how they have the place designed is all about good times with friends and family.

Menu is  extensive with fantastic options.  Party of 7 and we had different choice of food but pleasures by all.

Bar and draft offerings are the top.

Outdoors covered from the weather there Corn hole and ping pong tables plus the several options to sit comfortably after you enjoyed dining to continue the experience.  We will return for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I made reservations for C.D. a couple days before we were going to go because Hard Rock was having a concert we were attending and we wanted to make sure we got a table. When we arrived at 5pm, the place was mostly empty, which was fine. The hostess was Very Friendly and Talkitive. The inside was nice, a little funky and casual. Our waiter arrived shortly after and took drink orders. I was a bit suprised at how laid back he was, i knew from reading reviews that staff wore street clothes, however it took me byu suprise when out waiter pulled up a chat to take take our order. He was friendly and asnwered the million questions i had. We had crusty bread for an app., it was great (i love bread) The drinks we ordered were AMAZING, The service was quick and our food arrived hot. I got the pub burger, which was one of the best burgers I have ever had. My husband got the meatloaf, which was pink on the inside, really pink. He ended up sending it back, the manager came over to our table and explained it was cooked, it looked pink because of the way it was cooked but they were making a new meat loaf for my husband, He was very friendly and professional. Once the meat loaf came out it was done perfect. We decided that we were going to have dessert and otdered the monkey bread, our waiter let us know its made fresh so it will 8-10 mins. Between the time we waited for the meatloaf and when we ordered dessert, they got busy, which put them a bit behind. So after 15 mins of waiting for our dessert (whioch it didnt seems that long, we were having a nice time talking and having a drink) the manager comes over to the table, and lets us know he has good news and bad news, the bad news is our monkeybread is going to take another 8 mins but in the mean time they are going to comp us andother dessert for free and sets down the salted carmel pudding with house made carmel corn. It was wonderful, the best pudding i have ever had. Once out monkey bread arrives our waiter lets us know that is on the house as well, i treid telling it was fine we were more than happy to pay for it but he wouldnt add it to the bill. My husband loved the monkey bread. i did not have any becuase i was beyond full. We had a wonderful experince, the staff and manager were all great. I can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Seriously the absolute worst food ever. This is the second time I've ate here the first time I don't think I knew yelp existed it was years ago and this time we wanted to go somewhere for Easter brunch. I literally got the most simple meal eggs and bacon  and has-browns and toast. Disgusting . Bread hard as a rock , potatoes over seasoned and nothing special , cocktail was so over priced and as small as a toddlers soppy cup. Just so disappointed it's such a cool atmosphere but everyone at our table hated the food that we almost wanted to send it all back. If your gonna have a cool atmosphere and hype your place up as authentic fresh food make it at least taste good."}
{"text":"Food was great!
Atmosphere was great!
Waiter was great!
Live entertainment was great!
Took a little while to get seated but the bar had lots of Brews"}
{"text":"i came here a few times on a little jaunt to scottsdale last week. the first time the wait was an hour and a half so my friend and i headed to the bar for a drink an then somewhere else for dinner. 

the second time was for an early dinner we were able to be seated right away and started out with a few of the appetizers and drinks. i decided to be a bit adventurous and try the sauerkraut  a gin martini with a combination of orange marmalade and grain mustard it was actually quite delicious and complex. The anti pasti was nothing to write home about but if you are going to order something from that menu get the 12 hour roasted tomatoes they are really delicious. however you must order the pretzel bites and fontina fondue that was a really yummy starter and seems to be a favorite in the restaurant. 

for an entre my gf and i split the grilled cheese sliders and the seared tuna salad. the sliders come with bacon and tomatoe on them and im not sure of the type of cheese. they were a little bit of a let down they needed to be seasoned with something. 

the salad had a nice vinaigrette on it HOWEVER!!! the salad has cashews in it, the menu description makes no mention of cashews at all. i always assume that its common restaurant courtesy to mention if a dish has nuts in it because so many people have nut allergies or sensitivities.( I am one of those crazy nut people, cashews make me violently ill and i was really worried i'd be spending my saturday curled up on the bathroom floor)  so maybe in the future they could update the menu so there wont be any unpleasant surprises in my salad. 

my third visit was for a late lunch after a friend had finished his game. once again we were seated right away this time my gf ordered the mac burger it looked like big mac but better, our friend ordered the shrimp po boy which looked delicious as well and i ordered the coq au vin which comes with lardons and is served on a generous bed of swiss chard. it was so delicious and i am determined to replicate the dish at home. 

all in all a great time was had by all at culinary dropout i really wish i could give this place 3 and a half stars but i will definitely be back next time i'm in scottsdale"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great menu. The staff was great. I had ordered a burger that came with bacon and I asked the server to remove it because I do not eat pork products. She made sure to ask if I don't eat pork because the bbq sauce on the burger also contained pork. Never have I ever been asked to clarify and I was so happy with the service that they would think to ask that. When my burger came they had forgotten to take the bacon off and the server made sure to remake my burger with all new ingredients. Wonderful service, can't praise it enough."}
{"text":"nice and friendly waitress made my family happy hour wonderful family time! The pretzel fondue is absolutely tasty! also like the house salad. cool decor."}
{"text":"Decided to try numerous items on the menu.. pretzel bites.. very fresh soft and yummy!  Perogees a must try. Great sauce.  The 36 hour ribs were fall off the bone and finally the dessert a cinnamon apple monkey bread, perfect ending."}
{"text":"This place can be a hot spot so a little environment can get lost at times but the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Lunch here was good! I shared the prime rib beef dip and the pub burger with a friend. The pub burger was the standout, really good flavor, however we asked for medium doneness and it was very rare. The prime rib beef dip did not disappoint either. Nice garlicky note to it and bread was perfectly toasted. The fries were pretty much your regular fries. 

Ambiance is trendy with extremely vaulted ceilings and a large open floor plan.  I noticed that the built in bench needed some repair as some of the buttons have come off. It's pretty dark inside so facing the bright windows will backlight your friends and hurt your eyes, my friend moved seats because it was bothering his eyes so much."}
{"text":"Such a great time with the live music. I was glad I was having so much fun that I honestly didn't care my food came out 1 1/2 hours late. Our server was great as he walked us through the menu and updated me on my food status. Unfortunately I don't remember this gentleman's name but I certainly won't forget his awesome BACON socks. Food was great but the atmosphere was even better!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner before a show at The Joint (January 2016). The waitress was good and gave great drinks recommendations. Also there was a live band that was pretty good but not too loud to where you cant have a conversation. Food was good as well. I had the pork belly nachos which were huge and delicious. Definitely worth the price. My friend had a sandwich but I dont remember which one (sorry) but he seemed to enjoy it.  Overall I'd have dinner here again."}
{"text":"Super AHSUM service from Carissa.  Caring, intuitive, not to mention attentive on a busy Saturday night...  

What a great experience!  Thanks Carissa for paying attention to every detail.  

The nachos were great, the mussels were perfectly prepared and the fried chicken looked like I will have that next time:)."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have a classy time with coworkers. Only downside is the prices and leaving your table to play games. If you want to play a game you forfeit the table you just waited 30 minutes for.
It makes no sense that there is no reservation system in place to save your table while you play a game to wait for your food. Isn't that the entire concept of this business?"}
{"text":"This place is terrific. Such a great scene, cool vibes, and the restroom facilities are first class. 

The pretzel rolls w fondue appetizer was AMAZING. loved them so much it was hard to want to save room for my meal. One of those could serve about 6 ppl probably. 

Also had the prime rib friend dip which was fantastic. My wife's pub burger was decent. 

But the restroom facilities are amazing. Solid core doors on all stalls, wonderfully designed color/tile scheme, and a huge trough sink that's very roomy. Also the only partition between the men's and women's sink portions of the restrooms are the mirror so you can actually see through to the women's restroom. Kind of a cool detail!"}
{"text":"Understanding this is not a \"kid\" friendly location  but was nearby so stopped. Salad, pretzels and French dip fantastic!  The kids Mac and cheese and chicken tenders not so much.  Son has nut(s)/sesame seed  allergy so opted burger on pretzel bun. It came out with a few sesame seeds on it so just cut up the meat and tossed the bun.  Compared to the Phoenix location (full of families)this one needs work! If you have food allergies beware as I don't think staff is trained to handle (and should be).

Update 12/28-I was contacted by the general manager about our experience which is truly appreciated.  They want us to come back, and enjoy the experience (as I did at the Phoenix location), while feeling assured of food allergies awareness there.  We will give it another try and update after."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and it was really good.  As expensive as the food is, they have a paper bag special which is a crappy beer in a brown paper bag for a $1.95.  I had the prime rib dip and it was really good, but a bit pricey.  The inisde of this place is very nice, wtih a large chandelier.  There was also a stage for a band however I did not see a band play when I was there.  Friday-Sunday nights only."}
{"text":"The husband and I stopped here for drinks (and only drinks) so I can only speak to that. He had their 3 bitters manhattan and enjoyed it very much. I was really excited to try a mule, since they have a whole menu of different mules. I decided to try the ginger and mary ann mule and it was unfortunately not awesome. It didn't taste at all like a mule.. you couldn't taste the ginger.... also, the muddled fruit included blackberry (which tastes fine, but I dislike in drinks because of the seeds). The flavor was not awesome and they served it with the tiny cocktail straws.... generally that's ok, but not with a drink that has seeds in it! I could not drink this with the straws, they became plugged with seeds every 5 seconds or so. This is fairly unpleasant. Anyway, that is not a big deal, but I wish the flavor was better for a 10$ drink. I'll have to come back to try the food, but I don't know that this would be a drinking spot for me."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is one of those places that I'd like to love, but I really just think it's ok. They have super tasty pretzels with cheese and chips with a sour cream dip. Their cocktails aren't my favorite, especially considering other Fox restaurants have tasty cocktails. The yard is cute, but I dislike the mandatory valet parking and the fact that they tend to be craaazy busy. Regardless, I'll be back for some hh pretzels... yummm."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here. Constantly great service and food and the atmosphere is cool, too.  It's a must when I'm in the area.  In fact, went here multiple times last visit when I stayed in the hotel with a friend."}
{"text":"My son's favorite restaurant. He even had his last birthday party here on a Saturday afternoon. A preteen birthday party? Not such a stretch, the restaurant is the Chuck E Cheese for hipsters and I say that not unkindly. The food is marvelous and the staff is well-trained and attentive. My son enjoys creating his own antipasti plate and the spicy bloody mary is mommy's best friend."}
{"text":"Ambience was great. Waitstaff was accommodating and funny. The ribs were yummy and the beer was cold. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Worst night at a restaurant ever.  Waited an hour for a table then an hour after that for food.  I'm normally very patient and have eaten here before. Never had as bad experience as tonight.  They comp'd the meal but since this is my first Yelp post ...that tells you how bad this experience was tonight."}
{"text":"I definitely don't recommend coming here if you have a big group. Doesn't matter if you have a reservation or not. We came on a Saturday for my friend's birthday. It was packed and very loud. Although they did have live music. Our reservation was for 16 people at 8 pm. We didn't even get seated until 30 minutes later. What's the point of a reservation then? And then we didn't even get to sit together. We were divided into two tables. 

I ordered the sweet corn cannelloni. I didn't really enjoy it much. Because of the sweet corn it definitely tasted very sweet to me. So that was kind of a weird taste. 

Honestly the only thing I enjoyed here was my drink. I ordered the deviant behavior. Definitely really good."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and multiple friends told me to check this place out. I went with some work friends on a Thursday, but called ahead since we were told they would be very busy (great idea). We arrived as a full group and got a large table immediately. Unfortunately, that was the end of our luck. The server stopped by and offered us more time since we had never been there before. Good right? Wrong, he disappeared for over 20 minutes, and only returned after someone at our table flagged him down. We finally ordered our drinks and dinner, and enjoyed the many TV's around the restaurant. About 25 minutes had past and we had not received our drinks. One of my co-workers was about to walk out when the drinks arrived. About a minute later our appetizers and dinner arrived at the same time. I have to admit, I had the Italian Grinder sandwich which was excellent, unfortunately the service ruined the evening. I am sure if the service was better I would have scored at least a 4. Maybe next time???"}
{"text":"Fun & casual. Sat outside in a corner booth...great seat for a date. Great fried chicken!"}
{"text":"The name itself sounds rebellious, so I had huge expectations of rowdiness when I came here but was pleasantly surprised at how classy and friendly the staff was.  

Culinary Dropout was our first stop in Vegas when we arrived.  We were hungry, thirsty and needed to start partying after our flight from Orange County. We arrived in Las Vegas at 9 PM, so we were lucky enough to miss the dinner crowd, but I had reservations regardless (which I booked through Opentable.com).

The restaurant wasn't very crowded, but the people who were there seemed to be enjoying their time drinking and laughing.  Our server was very sweet, accomodating and was on top of our orders.  I wish I could remember her name, I'd like to say thank you for getting our weekend off to a great start with her great service.

The ambiance is super laid back, casual and teetering on the hipster side.  I can see it working for a party with friends, or a romantic date.  

We decided to order apps instead of meals so we have a little more room for alcohol (ha!).  We ordered the artichoke hearts, pretzel fondue (that everyone on Yelp is raving about), and a charcuterie of Iberico ham and manchego cheese.

Artichoke hearts:  tender, with a slightly smoke flavor.  It had this cheesy cream that went well with it, topped with baby spinach.  They also drizzled it with an orange marmalade which I personally didn't care for.  I like orange marmalade on toast, but not on my artichoke hearts.  

Pretzel fondue:  Everyone was raving about this here on Yelp.  I found it too salty for my liking.  There was almost too much salt on the pretzels and the fondue (served in a cute little pot and tealight warmer) had a slightly gritty texture, and that was salty too, reminded me of Cheez Whiz out of a jar.  Maybe they made it salty on purpose because we were pounding beer after beer to wash it down.

Now for the BEST part of our meal, the Iberico ham: O.M.EFFING.G. Talk about melt in your mouth awesome goodness.  It was like butter, no gaminess, with a slightly sweet note in the back.  It went well with the slightly salty bitterness of the manchego cheese.  They served it with a cherry compote on the side and two pieces of crostini bread and made a fancy little ham and cheese sandwich.  Mind you, they gave us maybe half a cup of thin ham shavings at MP $19.

Bottom line, would I come back here?  Probably not.

With all the various and unique dining experiences Vegas has to offer, I don't think Culinary Dropout is memorable enough for me to take time out of my precious vacation to venture back here.  At least I can say that I gave it a shot, and that I actually finally got to taste Iberico ham."}
{"text":"Delicious menu and great friendly service! Will return soon! The variety in the menu was very helpful and even during a busy day, they were able to walk by and check on us frequently!"}
{"text":"I only had lunch here, but the dinner menu looks great. We split an ahi tuna salad & a turkey pastrami sandwich on this tasty pretzel roll - yum! The decor is contemporary with really nice, cushy patio seats. I liked the bar setup. It had a window where you could sit outside looking in, as well as in the bar. I'd come back for dinner for sure."}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is one of my favorite places to eat at. I have never been disappointed at the quality of food. My favorite appetizer is their Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue. I have a corn allergy and have been able to eat these every time. My favorite cocktail that they make is the Spanish Apple Tango. I would reccomend anything on their menu. Their ingrediants are quality and that is pretty much the reason why I can eat there."}
{"text":"I had the turkey pastrami sandwich with Swiss and coleslaw on a pretzel bun....it was mehhhh...pretty average, turkey pastrami seemed salty. My friends had the tuna salad, they said it was good, but not enough tuna. Dessert was good, it was the salted caramel brûlée..
Not good enough to go back a second time. Ambiance seems fun, but loud if you like that!
Waitress was really funny and nice!"}
{"text":"Fast service and good food reasonably priced for brunch. 

Would like to see expansion of their breakfast menu but with they had right now Iwas very delicious would like to be back to try their lunch and dinner menu. 

Liked their casual bar and play area like vibe 

I had their avocado toast egg white frittata coffee and potato and cheese Petoskey"}
{"text":"Hands down best Resturant I've had since in Scottsdale. Fillippo was our server and did an excellent job explaining which items were suitable for our half Vegetarian group. Must  Order - The Pretzel fondue, Korean Brussel sprouts, Kale Salad, Turkey pastrami sandwich were all top notch! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The drinks were so good, I'm still dreaming of them.

While hostess team needs some work, the managers and waiter went above and beyond to correct our experience before we left. 

For a first time visitor the place seemed over hyped, but it was trendy, fun and oh, those drinks!!!!!"}
{"text":"It has a very creative name, and it makes you wonder what is behind the name. We went into this location after a long flight from Miami, so i was hungry and wanted good food. I received amazing food! The waitress was extremely friendly and helpful in guiding us through the menu and different beer selections. The burger was outstanding and the pretzels were to die for. I however recommend that you skip the corn bread it was not to my liking. I can not wait to visit Arizona again and go back to this location."}
{"text":"So much fun! Amazing food! The atmosphere is great, the people are great, and it's one of those places I'd feel comfortable going to the bar alone because the bartenders and all employees are so chatty and nice:)"}
{"text":"This is easily the most disappointing experience we've had this year. 

Frustrating- Making us \"sign in\" by giving them our phone number, which they're already texting to get us to sign up for their mailing list.
Frustrating- Over-priced, mediocre food.
Frustrating- A server who was more interested in the game than in our order.
Frustrating- Waiting all night for our order.
Frustrating- Getting our entree completely wrong.
Frustrating- Apologizing by buying us a Kiltlifter, then charging us $7 for it.
Frustrating- Waiting ten minutes in a disorganized crowd for a valet to let us leave.

If a restaurant that won't let you in or out, won't give you the food you ordered, can't cook decent food, lies to you, and tops it off by spamming you succeeds in CenPho because the \"ambience\" is trendy, then it reflects poorly on all of us here. We're better than this."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale last month for a work function and one of our colleagues recommended dinner at Culinary Dropout. I loved the  feel of the restaurant. It wasn't pretentious , a little against the grain (another plus for me) & food was top notch.  We had the prosciutto deviled eggs and humboldt fog cheese  for appetizers. Both were delicious. I washed it down with a Kilt Lifter. For dinner I chose the Korean style ribeye cap while my friends ordered the meatloaf and ribs.  The ribeye was perfectly seasoned and cooked exactly as ordered.  Everyone in my party enjoyed their meals and commented  several times about the quality of the food, atmosphere and  friendliness of the staff.  I highly recommend it and will go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Cool place, but service sucks. Had to tell the waitress how to do her job.  Was told the beer we have is on the board behind the bar.  When we asked for 2 Stella's, we were told \"we don't have that\". Even thou it's in the bar board.  Grrrr"}
{"text":"This place was a joke.  Talk about trying way to hard to be what some 55 year old guy in Scottsdale thinks is \"cool\" these days...

This is Urban Outfitters in restaurant form, which might be forgivable if the food was any good or the menu cohesive.  For a \"gastropub\", the beer list was pretty pedestrian and the beer menu was inanely laid out.  The menu was all about clever, pseudo-hipster layout and not at all about conveying information about the beers.  On tap they have Lagunitas, but which Lagunitas?  They make several different brews.

The food was again trying way too hard to be trendy.  Unfortunately the gastropub trend jumped the shark 5 years ago, as evidenced by this pre-packaged chain restaurant.  In fact I think that this incarnation of a gastropub, cooked up by some restaurant company in that culinary mecca (and launching pad of a dozen chain restaurant monstrosities) of Scottsdale, AZ, may be the ultimate and final indicator of the gastropub shark jump.

The douchey beats from the pool outside pound through the restaurant and are beyond annoying.  The pretzels were stale and the cheese sauce they came with was grainy with too much flour in the bechamel.  The chicken curry was laughably bland with a couple of strands of dried up chicken breast and no rice (i took this one to go.)

This place is so derivative and contrived.  Simon Kitchen, First Food, and Society are already doing the comfort-retro food much better and don't need to package their menus in some goofy, obvious appeal to a specific demographic (except for First, which is itself an overly-conceived douchatoreum, but with slightly better food than CD).

The funny thing is that they are obviously trying to appeal to Brooklyn-hipster types, the exact people who wouldn't be caught dead in the HRH, let alone this charicature of a restaurant.

One extra star for the cool couches."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to speak with the manager Haley. She contacted me about the issues I encountered during my recent visit. She was very concerned and addressed each matter. I was impressed with her candor and honesty. The sent me a gift card for the value of our meal and asked it we would give them one more try to get it right. I believe we most definitely will. Nice to see a business that really cares about customer service!"}
{"text":"Hipster vibe, excellent wait staff, delicious food, pleasant acoustical music, fair prices. Definitely will go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Made it back in at the invite of Dan and I gotta say this place fires like a well oiled machine. 

Our reservations were in order and we got a table right away. We were served by a very polite and thoughtful waiter. The food was great. We never have ate here before so we decided to try a lot of different items. Had the nachos, which are just insanely good and I could have just ate those alone. Got the pretzels and cheese which the kids loved (me too!!). I ordered the prime rib sammie (sandwich) and the wife got the trout plate. It was wonderful. The service was top notch and the food was just as good. Dan even stopped by to say hello and ask about our Easter plans and talked to my kids. He was very polite and even though he no longer manages Culinary you can tell that he is still respected over there. 

Once again, thanks again to Dan, Hank, and the team that made our experience one to remember."}
{"text":"Met up with 5 other friends here. How fun. All these stores are under the The Yard. So parking is free. Just tip the valet. I had fried chicken!  I Don't make it at home and now I know why. It was done, but juicy, tender. Not too much coating. Friends had fish ( it was Fri) it was also tender and not too over done. Bisquites  were good. The pretzel bread served before dinner was Great!  Many beers to choose from. The bathrooms are friendly. As girls have theirs and bits have theirs- the washroom for both are a pass through. Funny."}

{"text":"I hear during the day is a different experience but I went at night with a group of friends and found a little gem in the city.  We went to the Tempe location and the space was huge!  There is a live band playing (some really good mix of songs through out the ages ranging from country to RnB to rock.  Their beer list is pretty decent with the exception of they don't carry a few simple ones that people might go to (ex: budweiser, corona, dos equis).  Though the selection of beer and drinks they had was delicious.  I had a wild blueberry beer and a drink called Drunken Panda.  They were both very fruity yet had a beer tang to them. 

Next we got food.  The 'appetizer' plate was mix of cheese meat slices bread and veggies that we picked and was a good mix of sweet and savory with a balsamic sauce.  Then I had the fried chicken with mashed potato and coleslaw and a honey biscuit.  The flavors were pretty good and the chicken was crispy (just how I like it).  My husband had the meatloaf ( which I chose both meals)  and it was also pretty good with a side of mashed potatoes.  I would definitely come back to this place again to try some more off the menu and some drinks for a good time.  

The service was decent but they were busy being a Friday night and all.  We had made a reservation with no problems and was seated right away.  They have the kitchen open late (til midnight) which I think is a bonus and they stay open til 1am on Friday nights.   

Can't wait to try this place again."}
{"text":"First visit was a weekday lunch. I ordered the kale and sweet corn salad. It was excellent! Everything ordered by the group looked great. Fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"We had a team lunch meeting here. No wait for seating  on the outside patio. It's not even May and it was a bit too warm.  I can see why people call this a hip place. The reviews and pics led to some very high expectations. 

Appetizers were very reasonable and all good.  Best two were the soft pretzel and provolone fondue and  the pork belly nachos. 

For lunch had the tasty turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll with swiss and coleslaw. Touted by some as a signature dish, not quite sure why it was called turkey  \"pastrami.\" The sandwich came with french fries. Those were unremarkable, no crunch to it. 

 I think we had a good sampling  of the more popular appetizers. Overall it was more than an ok experience, different food choices were good. Left in a food coma...I don't think that was heat stress.  Worth another visit with inside seating."}
{"text":"Was attending a Journey Concert and had to try this new hot spot out.
Maybe it was an off night, or maybe we ordered the wrong elements.
The greeters was fabulous we actually grabbed a seat in the bar area 
right behind them. Our waiter/server must have been constipated or 
shaved his manliness with a dull blade since he was rude and needed
a better attitude. When my wife asked him what frites was, he looked
at her like your kidding - I told my wife that its a fancy way of stating 
them as fancy fries - where he decided to correct me and state that 
was not so.. That frites are an assortment of thinly sliced vegetable.
Alrighty then.. onward.

We ordered:
Prosciutto Deviled Eggs  - Great - But Eats - (Natalie Youngs place has the best!)
Cheddar Pork Cracklings - Horrible - store bought stale with heavy dried cheese sprinkles

Cheap House Salad
Shaved Prime Rib Dip - Quite good
a few 
Between You & Me  drinks - Yes


The attitude of the server didn't help but the flaws in the quality of some of the menu items
will make this a non-repeat place its too bad cause the energy and decor rock!"}
{"text":"I was here on the 1st official night they were open (not the soft opening or the VIP party).  I have to say, I was impressed at how smoothly everything seemed to be running.  I didn't get to see the entire restaurant, but what I did see was really cool.  I sat at the 1st bar when you walk in the place.  The stool was really uncomfortable - there needs to be a footrest ON the stool, not just under the counter.  The server/bartenders who assisted me were very friendly and seemed genuinely excited about the products they were serving.  They have a good beer selection, something that is just now starting to happen more often in Vegas.  The bartender told  me that it is very important to them, the company started in PHX, who has a great beer scene.  The drink prices were a little high, but that is to be expected for the location.  I had the \"cheap house salad\" and the pretzels with fondue.  Both only took a few minutes before they were delivered.  And both were really delicious.  The salad comes standard with ranch dressing, and was tossed perfectly (not too much or too little dressing).  There were tomatoes and onions chopped up in it, along with some other stuff.  Now, the pretzels were AMAZING and totally worth comnig back for.  I don't know how they do it, but the cheese fondue that is served with them is absolutely orgasmic.  The pretzels are great for sharing, and are served in a paper lined dish.  The fondue comes in a small, individual pot with a candle underneath.  They were seriously SO good.

The menu is really diverse and there are so many different areas of the place, I think that there is something for everyone.  There is also a patio that looks down into the pool, so there is definitely some good people watching to be had here.  :)  I can't wait to go back and try some of their entress (and of course get more pretzels).  Everyone was so friendly and I really like the concept of the place.  Hopefully they are around for awhile, I hear they have quite a following in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is famous/popular for the Fried Chicken. 
- I don't quite get why they are famous for it... it's VERY salty. It's also a little dry. I am not a fan of the fried chicken - go to KFC or Chuch's if you want delicious fried chicken. If you like your fried chicken very salty and on the drier side, this dish might be right for you. However, the biscuits are delicious - they drizzle honey on it and I love the sweetness of it. The mashed potatoes just taste like regular mashed potatoes. So out of this entire dish, I like the biscuit with hone the most. 

The sweet corn cannelloni is AMAZING. I love the sweetness and gooeyness of the cannelloni. However, I didn't like the stuff that came with it. So the cannelloni is amazing but they have some onions and peppers cooked on top, it tasted weird to me. It was bitter or something. I don't know but just eat the sweet corn cannelloni and don't waste your time trying to figure out what else is going on in the dish. 

I like this place. I would return for the sweet corn - cute place.

The waitress was amazingly friendly and nice. She built a rapport with us and went over the dishes in detail about what it included. Great service! She also has a great attitude and positive upbeat personality which added to our experience. We asked for a candle b/c we couldn't see the menu and she found us one."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day. My table got the chicken nachos and thai chicken wings, which were both adequate--wings were tasty, but small and bony. Beer selection was pretty good as well, and wait staff was very helpful in finding us beers that we would enjoy. Portion sizes were good.

Our server definitely seemed like he was trying a little too hard to be friendly. Service was slow--our waiter took a long time to materialize after we sat down, and the food took forever to come out. Yet our waiter would linger for excessive periods of time and make weird, desperate jokes when he did decide to grace our table with his presence. I am probably being overly critical, but I found it a little odd.

I know that the cheese dip and pretzel bites are absolutely to die for--I had them at the Scottsdale location once, but resisted chasing the dragon on this visit. I recommend getting that if you want an appetizer.

Atmosphere is pretty good. The decor is lovely--I love the tables and chairs especially. But even as an design student in my early 20's I thought the whole vibe of the place was a bit too hipster-y for my tastes. Good place for mustache and beard spotting, though."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! I wish I could remember the name of our server, he was absolutely fantastic! I even forgot my dessert at the table and he chased us out the door to bring it to us! It was very busy but definitely fun to be able to play ping pong while we waited for our table! The only down side is that it is on the pricey side and as good as the food is, I'm not sure it's worth the amount we spent. Will probably go back for drinks and apps!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, but the service was the best part about it. We had the guy with the ponytail and he gave the best recommendations and was very friendly!! The chocolate pie and pretzels are a must!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very good food and fresh beer. This is a place where you want to enjoy your evenings and after work parties."}
{"text":"This Fox location has provided me with more disappointing experiences than I can count. I've had 6 or 7 visits here, and I've had service missteps every step of the way. I've gotten my appetizers after my entrees multiple times, the servers I've had are poorly versed in their menu and bar capabilities (not to mention often highly unusual and hard to notice since they're encouraged to dress like they would outside of work), and had overall unpleasant experiences. It's painfully obvious that they value aesthetics much more than service; there's no way I can get behind a restaurant like that. 

I'm not a Fox restaurant hater - I've worked at one, been to many, enjoyed myself most of the time... But the way they treat their employees and their guests (at this location in particular) leaves a lot to be desired. This doesn't include the fact that Fox cheaply and lamely copies dishes over from other menus, making it almost impossible to have a unique and new experience by visiting other restaurants within the concept group. Culinary Dropout in Tempe has given me no reason to return."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is wonderful! It's classic american with a twist. GO HERE if you LOVE FOOD"}
{"text":"the waiter was a pro. the food was incredible and I love how quickly you get your food after it leaves the grill the mashed potatoes and steak where still piping hot. the drinks were incredible. everything was cooked to perfection. homade potato chips and french onion dip were amazing. perfect atmosphere and decor. would definetly return :)"}
{"text":"The food and service here were pretty good. The oysters from Washington state were delicious but we went again and the oysters were not the same quality. But all in all it was just fine."}
{"text":"Well, the name is apt, that's for damn sure. I can clearly see how and why he/she/they dropped out.  The \"culinary\" isn't all that bad, albeit over-seasoned. But, it's like a sports bar that met a country farm wedding in a barn.  The service is just not good. I sat, invisible, at the bar for a good 10 minutes at 6 (not busy). Then, when I finally got someone's attention to order a couple of bites, I was asked to \"check the box\".  Really?!?!  I hate that (and the stupid waste of paper). If you don't have sense enough to remember 2 items (or be able to send them to the kitchen for production on anything other than a grocery list), give it up!  I made a couple of scratches on the sheet and was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  I'm still confused why the \"bites\" would all arrive on one dinner plate ... Poorly arranged (as opposed to separate small tapas-style plates). And that cheese chunk (with no bread) was laying right there along with all the rest: ODD. Plus, the Brussels sprouts were as cold as a stone. I don't get that either. The thyme with beets and balsamic was a treat (can't wait to try that at home).  But, one beet bite was overlooked and the next was raw. Too bad. 

Service never got any better, unfortunately ... Received the wrong items  after scratching them on my grocery list and had to practically strangle one of those bartenders for another cocktail (actually a glass of wine). Too bad.  

Finally, stop asking for my damn name. I was asked 7 times in an hour and 15 mins by at least 4 different people. If you can't serve 10 people at the bar on a Wed night with five people back behind the bar, then yes ... Please: DROP OUT and GIVE IT UP!"}
{"text":"This is a huge place. And it's noisy. But the food was good and our server Coop was excellent. He was helpful and had a great sense of humor. 

I had the Gorgonzola chicken salad. It was fresh and the chicken tender. My husband got the turkey pastrami sandwich with fries on a pretzel bun. He said it was good. 

They have an area with semi circular couches around a fire pit and another with corn hole and ping pong tables. They also have private party rooms. 

And the main dining area is huge. They also have a smaller dining area in the back, past the ping pong tables. TVs everywhere. There is a lot going on. The host was friendly and sat us right away."}
{"text":"I called in for a large to go order (6 people) like I've done before) and I was told due to there large reservations tonight, they aren't accepting to go orders.  Nice to know that you'll only accept to go orders when your slow on business. I will take my business elsewhere.  Thank you for coming across like such an elitist place."}
{"text":"My first experience here and it was amazing. We came on a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't packed and there was plenty of parking.

We were seated immediately and our server was quick to get drinks and an appetizer started. The $5 pretzels and fondue appetizer was delicious, probably the best I've ever had.

Then I got the fried chicken and it was great as well. Overall it was a great experience and the restaurant atmosphere was great. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"After waiting 1 hour and 35 minutes to be seated (was told 45-60) the food was not good. Boxed mashed potatoes,  terrible meatloaf,  overcooked chicken,  not worth the wait at all. Would not recommend unless you're looking for a hangout spot."}
{"text":"This place just has a cool vibe, especially the Moulin-Rouge-ish light fixtures and hipster-looking employees. I really enjoyed our antipasti choice: jamón ibérico (for the salty goodness), garlic & herb goat cheese (soft and creamy...probably the best goat cheese I've ever had!), roasted beets & balsamic (perfectly tart and juicy to cut the saltiness of our protein and richness of the cheese), and the truffle potato chips (which was \"ok\" but added some crunch to complete our appetizing mix). As an extra (free) compliment, they surprised us with some sweet candied grapes which worked well with our small charcuterie board. We didn't have any alcohol, but I felt a bit buzzed after completing our meal, probably from all the tyramine, haha! I personally wouldn't eat here on a daily basis, but would recommend as a fun trendy place to hang out with friends on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Had such a great experience here. From the pretzels with smoky cheese fondue to the burrata/heirloom tomato salad to the most delicious French fries (dipped in our leftover fondue sauce)...wonderful! The patio was fantastic on a Monday night. Peaceful, with excellent service from our server, Jeff. 

They even threw in a dessert for free after our feast for four and treated our kids kindly, which is rare at trendier restaurants. I will be making all of the Fox restaurant concepts a habit. It was excellent."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere, especially if you are going with friends and looking to spend some time. They had live music and the items I ate were great.
We had pretzel rolls with fondue and it was very good. While the cheese was nothing special, with the pretzels it was perfect. I also ordered the Korean style rib eye cap. That was awesome. I loved it. Cooked a medium rare was perfect.
It isn't the cheapest place but I'm guessing you were looking to pay that much when you chose the place. It is a must try."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My friend and I went for their Happy Hour (3-6pm) . They have a wide variety on the HH menu which makes it great when you want to try different things. We were seated outside on the patio, and our waitress was so sweet to allow us to order off the HH menu even though its not typically allowed since we were from out of town.  We ordered red sangria -- to die for, the pork belly nachos-- amazing, antipasti and kale salad. Everything was so delicious. The atmosphere was super chill and I like the open and airy layout. It connects to the hard rock pool so you had a nice outdoor view and could hear the music from rehab. The décor was great. Overall we had a great time. The staff was so friendly, I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"We love this place!!!! We met friends last night for an early dinner and drinks. Here's a rundown. 

Food was excellent!!! Server was fast and attentive. Food came out quickly and was tasty.
What we ordered- 
The soft pretzel appetizer
Nachos
Oysters
Seared tuna salad
Corn ravioli
Turkey sandwich
Another sandwich (don't remember which)
Plus 10 specialty cocktails

Pros- 
Beautiful, hip restaurant
Food isn't crazy expensive
Good portion sizes (esp the soft pretzels)
Awesome outdoor area

Cons- 
Drinks are pricey ($12-16ish)

Can't wait to go back. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Our day started out well enough - spent the morning at the Farmer's Market, ran up to the mall to do some shopping, and decided on lunch. We initially wanted to give Modern Steak a go. We walked in and 4 employees hung around the hostess desk chit chatting, and when we asked to be seated they told us they didn't open for another 30 minutes. Their attitude was kind of snotty, so we (gladly) left and walked over to our second choice, Culinary Dropout.

Again, we were early, but what a different experience. The host greeted us with a huge, welcoming smile and we were immediately seated, despite arriving before the actual opening time. The kitchen was ready, and our waitress, Britney, was absolutely lovely.
We ordered antipasti: a gorgeous smoky cheese, with some prosciutto and grissini, and bread with olive oil. Fabulous! Then, the homemade chips and dip were brought. Perfect! We split a salad (that had pickled sour apples, which, let me tell you, were the stars of the dish). Excellent.

But nothing ... and i mean NOTHING ... could top dessert. Salted Caramel Custard.

I still dream about it. Between the gorgeous decor, exceptional service and yummy food, Culinary Dropout is definitely a new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"Can I just say that by far, one of my favorite things about attending Life is Beautiful festival is the pretzels with fondue! 

3 years in a row those pretzels are amazing. The fondue has the perfect flavor and consistency is beyond perfect. I feel like  achieving an impeccable consistency of a melted cheese is difficult, but you guys have done it. 

I look forward to next year's festival only for those pretzels. But this time I'm going to do myself the favor and try the restaurant! I'm so excited!"}
{"text":"Fun and trendy! Our waitress was very attentive even though she was slammed. Pretzel fondue was amazing, I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"The Culinary Dropout , you get the best of both worlds. The food is off the hook (it's great) ,the service, these ladie's and guy's take care of your every need, and as a added bonus you have some of the best performers in Phoenix, entertaining you while you dinne.....Check it out....Bluesman Mike"}
{"text":"Oh my God this food is amazing.  Great atmosphere and staff. Pork belly nachos, onion dip, pretzels and cheese, French dip and meatloaf taste so good it makes you want to smack your mama. My new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Always happy with my order at the Culinary Drop out, and love the vibe at The Yard.  Great service during the week.  Sometimes outside can be hit or miss when busy in the weekends.  We like going to The Drop Out with big groups."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Culinary DO for a while. It is a three-dollar place so we can't really go often for financial reasons. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. It comes with ham, bacon, mayo, tomato and lettuce on a pretzel bun. OMG it was so bland. Bacon was just ok. Chicken dry and bland. Pretzel bread hard and flavorless. I was so confused. French fries looked delicious but were dead. Husband ordered the ribs. Ribs were fantastic but again WTF on the fries and his coleslaw was like practically from a grocery store deli. Nothing special. Really disappointed. Went there years ago. Got the Fried chicken which was delicious. I feel with the exception of the ribs everything was IHOP or Denny's quality. Service was also slow. But who cares about service when it is the food that matters."}
{"text":"This past Saturday night, my girlfriend took me to dinner here with a few friends to celebrate my birthday.  She heard me mention that I wanted to check out the possibility of holding my corporate Xmas party here.  Someone mentioned it and I hadn't been here yet. We checked in and we were told we'd get a text when our table was ready.  We hung out at the bar ordering drinks and after waiting 30 mins, I approached the hostess.  She advised me that we were already seated.  Well obviously we weren't.  No apology or anything, just hold on while they figure out how someone else took our table.  After we were finally seated, waiter came over.  He was ready to take our order right away, forget more drinks he just wanted to get the food on order.  Needless to say, this guy lacked basic customer service skills.  After taking our order by memory, he came back 5 mins later to try and remember the order.. Really?? Write it down if you can't remember it.  We made the best of this mess.  Food was ok, just tainted by the other experience.  I was shocked at the lack of caring about everything that happened.  Not even a visit by a manager.  Mistakes happen, but how your service responds to the errors is everything.  This experience cost your establishment a 6k+ party and a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I had given up on Culinary Dropout over a year ago after my first couple of trips.  The food was ok, but the service was not good and there was a general chaos and disorganization that seemed to permeate everything.  Last weekend we returned for the first time to meet some friends, and I have to say that the experience has changed dramatically.  The service was en pointe, the food was very good, and we had a fantastic time.  They have turned things around and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The venue is awesome, I'd go back for it alone. I went with a coworker for lunch which was great, we thought, because not busy...unfortunately though it wasn't busy it had no bearing on the quality of service. It started with the person showing us to a table almost tossing the menus at us when we said we wanted to sit at the couches which aparantely \"are self-seating\". It took so long for our waitress to come we started to think ordering food was \"self-serving\" as well. That being siad, our waitress was very pleasant and interaction was great however we spent a lot of time flagging her down. Maybe service would have been better if we sat indoors? As for the food we got the ribs and the pretzel/fondue dish. I found both well made and tasty I would say I found my ribs a little too salty and they combined with the salty fries were a little much but the ribs were still one of the most tinder rib dishes I've ever had so if you'd don't mind the salt I'd say get it."}
{"text":"Wow what a great venue. Open and lively. Good selection of beverages as well as entries. We all ordered different meals (4 of us) and we're happy with what we got. Very delicious and the portions were filling. The pretzel appetizers and cheese dip were so addictive.  the atmosphere is electric and the server staff works double time to ensure prompt service. Take a minute to watch the kitchen staff hustle in the hallway. Moving like mad men to ensure fast service for the food. No waiting around to see who will address your needs. They are on top of it."}
{"text":"My friend celebrated her birthday here yesterday evening. We were the first three of about 15 people to show up. The server was really inconsistent and scatterbrained. As soon as we were seated, she asked us if we were ready to order drinks. After telling her we needed some time, she came back two minutes later to ask again. We asked for a HH menu and she came back several minutes later with one. Errrr.. OK, I guess the 3 of us can share... not that big of a deal I suppose. 

10 minutes later, she came back and we ordered our drinks and appetizers. While waiting for our orders, more people started to trickle in. By the time she came back to our table, there were about 10+ people passing around 1 happy hour menu. Either that was the only copy in the whole restaurant or she didn't want us to order from it because as soon as someone set it down, she snatched it up and took off w/ it. WTH!? 

While everyone was laughing about it and asking \"did that really just happen?!\" our food arrived. My friend & I shared the pork belly cubano and chicken fingers. Both were OK, but they should have just named the pork belly cubano a ham cubano because the piece of pork belly was no larger than 2 fingers. A total disappointment because I was looking forward to the pork belly the most! As for our drinks, she was OK if we flagged her down to take our (alcoholic) drink orders, but she was really scatterbrained when it came to refilling our waters! I asked several times for a refill, but she would walk away after refilling other people's half full glasses and ignore my completely empty glass. She did this to a few other people too that asked for water.

There were a few other servers that were helping her out w/ our table. When they brought out the orders, they would just drop off the plates wherever they felt like. Sometimes they would drop it off at one end of the table, sometimes in the middle, sometimes at the other end. Never once did they ask who it belonged to. When one dish was brought to my friend, she gave him a puzzled look and he started to walk away. She said \"I guess I can figure out who this belongs to..\" and he came back and said \"well I guess I can do it if you don't want to...\" WTF. Isn't it his JOB to?!? 

My friend said she had a very similar experience last time too. Needless to say, I won't be back. Such a shame since I work right across the street and my co-workers and I eat out almost everyday."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great appetizer, definitely get the pretzel and cheese fondue. So good and it's a good amount to share! I haven't been let down by the food here. Everything from the Pub burger, to the chicken curry is great. Wonderful flavors and cooked to perfection. Definitely My favorite place in old town. Love the atmosphere of this restaurant, too."}
{"text":"Large appetizers, fun menu selection and great drinks. We came here with friends who are pretty picky eaters and they found lots of options that they enjoyed. Service was a little slow even though the place wasn't very full. Our waitress would disappear and I had to go to the bar to get silverware for someone who was never given any."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The pretzels and cheese are an absolute MUST!! Lexi was our waitress and she was SO sweet and helpful! We had some not feet table neighbors but she still took time to talk with us and make sure everything was the way we wanted! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty impressive place, considering all the employees were of collegiate age.  Tyler was amazing! Very personal, attentive, warm and sincere.  

The food is amazing.  Something for EVERYONE!  Substations were no problem.  Cocktails were generous and reasonably priced.  

Tristan"}
{"text":"This place is awesome from the staff to the ambiance, and of course the food! Sit at the bar and ask for Matt. He is amazing! He has a passion for craft cocktails that shines through, and his knowledge of the menu is top notch and gives great recommendations. Sit back and let him guide you through a fantastic experience. 

I had the Salmon Avocado Toast, and it was amazeballs! Thoroughly satisfied. What is in the spread - tangy, salty, creamy, and perfectly accentuated all the other components of the dish? #idied"}
{"text":"The perfect place to go grab something light to eat or get fun cocktails. I highly recommend the beef jerky because it's amazing and what other restaurant makes beef jerky? You can't go wrong with any cocktail because they are all unique and that good!"}
{"text":"So glad for this addition to the Hard Rock.  Pretzel Fondue is fab!  Prices are great...good service.  The decor is very rocker chic and the atmosphere enjoyable!  Wonderful menu selections and a great patio experience as well!"}
{"text":"Not so hot! Adventurous menu badly executed. Initial entry into the restaurant entices you. The drink selection is attractive. The staff are friendly, pleasant and accommodating. The menu promises a unique selection of international and regional dishes. The anticipation builds. Your meal arrives. You taste for the first time and are instantly deflated. I chose the pork belly ramen. Flavorless broth and overcooked belly. Atrocious. My adjacent colleagues ordered the jambalaya which was devoid of moisture. The fried chicken was good however, and the deviled eggs were spot on. Shame this placed missed the mark."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place (more than just the average 3 stars). Awesome decor/ambiance, plenty of room for large parties, live music, and Ben (our server) was super nice. 

We were starving and got 2 appetizers that came out very quickly. The Pretzel bites were yummy, but the portion was way too large for 2 people. It's too bad they don't have 2 sizes & prices to choose from. Their profit margin on this item is crazy. Anyway, the Deviled eggs were the highlight of the whole meal since it was made with truffle oil. If you add that to anything, I guess it would be delicious in my opinion. ;)

Anyway, we decided to try the Ribs as an entree since the description was so enticing as well as Ben recommended it. Being from the South, we definitely had very high expectations. Unfortunately, instead of being marinated for 36 hours in a great sauce, it tasted like a it was locked in the Salt Mines for days. I had 1 rib and couldn't eat anymore cause it required a glass of water to cure my thirst after that bite. It was really disappointing. I would have thought that they would have taken it off the bill and the manager came by, but was so awkward and didn't even acknowledge anything. 

The dinner started off so good and ended so strangely. It is a \"hip/trendy\" place and maybe we'll come back, but it could just be for drinks/patio in the future. Let's see. Hopefully, it gets better as the comments come rolling in."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  The food was really good.  Even though it was a crowded Friday night, the staff was very attentive.   Great experience and good food.   Try it."}
{"text":"met a friend here on a friday.   parking terrible unless you want to valet.   sorry, not everyone wants to valet - free or not.   that there is no other option for parking is ridiculous.  it's easier to find parking in downtown chicago.    food and service.-  meh.   average.      atmosphere.   loud.    net, net nothing special here.   won't be returning."}
{"text":"started at the bar with an appy..and a few beers with a friend.  later..the wife and the 14yr old showed up..dinner time.  son had fried rock fish..totally amazing.. starter soup..asperigus n chicken...amazing...funish it off with burgers and thai chicken wings...sublime!!! the Yard out back with its ping ping..schuffle board,cornhole and foosball great for the kiddos..will be back..many times!!"}
{"text":"We love Culinary Dropout.... but not this one.

This one is new (opened almost 3 mo) and seemed very chaotic with the staff.  Unfortunately, this was the first visit for 3 of my family members and it may mean they never return to a Culinary Dropout.  It took 15 minutes for drink refills (water included in that).

We had their famous pretzel and cheese appetizer.  That was delicious.  My brother had a burger and found that it was good.  My sister in law had the chicken salad and said it was way overdressed.  My mother had the nachos app and disliked the thick greasy chips.  I had the ramen soup and it was so salty I could't eat the broth and barely any of the soup.  gross!  Given that it took 15 min for drink refills I couldn't choke down the soup.  

They never came by to check on the food so none of it was sent back, we never saw the manager but at the beginning when he came to change a chair out telling us we couldn't use that one even though the hostess had put it there.

Needless to say, we will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Very relaxed and fun place. Love the nachos and Italian chopped salad. Will be back. Only downfall was the heat but that is not their fault."}
{"text":"Sir a food mistake I can take but rude service I do no not think so. I would not spend my money where we were treated bad. I love the chain I will go to other locations for sure ."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It is very hipster style. Good food that is not too expensive and a nice area outside with lots of games. Took my husband here for his birthday. To book a reservation of over 20 you have to spend minimum of 50$ per person and pay up front????? No thanks! Lovely live music. There is no accountability for people playing corn hole. They will go to dinner and not return the sacks so they can play later"}
{"text":"What can I say about this fun, cool place?!
I loved it, the vibe, the food the incredible service, I know Vegas is hospitality town USA and it really shows!!

Located inside The Hard Rock Hotel&Casino. The staff here get to wear what they want...
We seen some pretty cool rock star worthy outfits!!

All of our food&drinks were FANTASTIC!! It was a great find!"}
{"text":"We were here for brunch. Not a huge menu but both meals my fiancé and I got were good. He had a breakfast sandwich. Good but nothing out of the ordinary. My smoked salmon avocado toast though was unreal. Huge portion and actual salmon, not the cheap stuff you get in the grocery store. Our waitress was super sweet as well."}
{"text":"The mood, lighting, and atmosphere all around was very appealing (which is what attracted us there in the first place). The menu selections all sounded wonderful until our food actually arrived. It was very mediocre. I would have considered going back, except for the fact that the service was even worse than the food. 

I ordered a bottle of wine for my boyfriend and I to split. It didn't come to the table until after all of our food arrived. I'm assuming it's because our waitress was under 21 and unable to serve it herself, but she never even brought us waters in the meantime. The waitress that did serve the wine brought it directly to my boyfriend and asked if he'd like to try it without even acknowledging my presence, even though I'm the one who ordered the bottle in the first place. Which is even more annoying considering that our waitress was standing next to her witnessing this. He awkwardly handed her my glass to gesture that, and she said to him, \"Oh, would you like her to try it instead?\", as though I needed my boyfriend's permission to try the wine I ordered. It was an uncomfortable and awkward situation. 

We ordered a couple of appetizers with our meals. I ordered the BBQ Pork Belly nachos appetizer as my meal and told the waitress this so she knew to bring it out later with my boyfriend's burger instead of with the other appetizer. Go figure, the nachos were one of the first things to arrive. Our waitress even made a comment about them coming out sooner than I was hoping when she saw them on the table, yet did nothing about it. They weren't bad, but definitely nothing special considering that they were just made with processed cheese and fancy toppings (I honestly didn't expect anything more, so this didn't necessarily disappoint me). However, we were sitting outside in 55 degree weather, so the nachos got cold pretty fast, which made them even more disappointing. The rest of the food was good, but not great. 

Needless to say, we will not be going back, even if we were to have better service. The food itself wasn't worth it. If this is what Culinary School dropout food is like then my advice to the future chefs out there...DON'T DROP OUT!!"}
{"text":"You know those success stories that start with, \" I didn't even finish high school?\" They are few and far between, but sometimes the education system just holds you down, man. Such is the case with Culinary Dropout. I think the chefs behind this rebellious culinary institution felt their creativity stifle in the classroom.

The dishes were kind of experimental but not too far out there to be considered wackadoodledoo-ish. Soft pretzel nuggets accompanied by a provolone fondue. Homemade chips served with a whipped onion dip concoction. Charcuterie and fromage plates. Artichoke salad. Short rib orchiette pasta. Apple cinnamon monkey bread. It was a simple selection, yet executed with passion so every bite resulted in an \"ooh ahh\" moment. And to top it all off, the cocktails (particularly the Clown Punch topped with a pomegranate froth) were fun and designed to flirt with taste buds.

The décor is a confused mix of brick, chandeliers, mood lighting, loungey booths, communal wood tables, an inside and outside bar, open kitchen area, etc. But none of it clashed or begged for attention, it blended nicely together.

The live music on Saturday night had everyone at the table clapping, singing, and nodding in agreement. The band really made the experience complete.

Certificate or not, Culinary Dropout makes the grade for me."}
{"text":"This place was so good we came here twice in 2 days.

Service was great both times and the view they have of the pool is awesome and relaxing.

They have tons of beer on tap so you can get a great selection. They also have something called a paper bag special where you get a canned beer in a bag for like $2.50 and you just don't know what it is (unless you take it out of the bag, but that's spoiling it!).

The coup de grace here is the pretzels and fondue. It was absolutely amazing and I think I could eat it every day. Perfect bites of pretzels along with blazing hot cheese fondue. There is just nothing wrong to say about it.

I also got a burger one of the times we were there. It was okay, altho not spectacular. I honestly barely remember it a few days later. I just keep thinking about those pretzels..."}
{"text":"The pretzel balls are amazing and the ribs are to die for. I enjoyed the atmosphere and have heard nothing but good reviews from this place."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The food was really good and the service was great. The pretzel and cheese app was amazing. I got the raman soup and my friend got the kale and sweet potato salad. She loved it."}
{"text":"I finally followed my beloved baseball Giants of San Francisco to their spring training home, and after consulting Scottsdale yelpers, Culinary Dropout seemed like a good place to eat a late dinner on the first night.

Living in the South Bay Area, I generally assumed that relatively low population density equates to nothing but stripmalls and chain restaurants. Going to Scottsdale has shown me that this doesn't have to be the case. 

I do realize that the Fox group is a major presence in the food and nightlife scene in Scottsdale. This preeminence clearly isn't gained by aggressive annoying ad campaigns and stupid slogans...or by offering horrendously large portions to lure in lazy, poor, obese people.

They are successful, I imagine, because they take a good concept and consistently deliver it to locals and tourists alike at a reasonable price.

I likes me some swanky San Francisco restaurants, where you feel like you have to prove your worthiness to the server. And then you fork out $180 bucks and step over homeless people to get to your cab.

Culinary Dropout satisfies the swanky without the price or the pretentious service (not to mention the lack of homeless drug addicts passed-out in a puddle of their own excrement). Thank you Scottsdale PD police state!

I started with the 'nutty Irishman' cocktail, if I remember correctly. Jamison with Guiness reduction and some other stuff. Never heard of adding a Guiness reduction to a cocktail...or reducing Guiness at all, but I am a fan. My special lady had the cocktail with the pomegranate foam on top...step aside Ferran Adria, this is the best use of foam i can think of.

The Cuban pork belly sandwich appealed to me...you had me at pork belly. My dainty little girlfriend had the chopped Italian salad. My sandwich was bomb-diggidy, although I was less-than-impressed with the chopped salad with Kraft-tasting Italian dressing on it...but I would never order that, so I'm not hating.

While I'm on it, WTF is with every single Scottsdale restaurant putting some kind of 'chopped' salad on their menu? Just sayin'. That seems like some iceberg, cucumber, and carrot thing you put ranch on in the Midwest somewhere. I digress.

I was too full to try the monkey bread...my mom makes that, and I love it. We had to come back another night to try it, and it did not disappoint. And neither did the people-watching on a Friday night. They must have a 23yr old blond girl generator somewhere in this town.

The title tells it all: Culinary Dropout. Not that they can't cook here, it's that they don't feel the need to put on their tall hat and adhere to some antiquated notion of cuisine. They make good food that people like in a festive and swanky atmosphere. Just because they have an amazing space and a well-thought-out and well-invested aesthetic concept, that doesn't mean they have to try and make inaccessible food that you need to download the Oxford Food-Lovers app on your iPhone to translate the menu. And every employee I interacted with was oozing with genuine hospitality.

Next year when I come back, and I WILL come back, I will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"This place is uber fun!  It has everything you need for a fun night out.  Good food, lots of beer, good service, and a really cool atmosphere.  We spent probably 4 plus hours here.  We came a little early to get a bigger table..and we were successful, scoring an 8 seater.

We had friends come shortly after that were shown to their table (you could get lost in this place).  You can eat \"outside\" near a fire pit or inside like us at a long table.  The options are endless.  If you feel lucky, try the paper bag beer...It was a PBR, boom!

We continued to eat and drink while making our way to the ping pong tables and bags.  We had to revisit the bar because that's what you do ha!  All an all this place is such a good place to meet with friends, have a bday or whatevs."}
{"text":"This is an Adult's playground!  Culinary Dropout insured that they would be open for a very long time being a part of The Yard.  The Yard consists of bags, ping pong and booze.  You can get a table, sit, run around, play games and enjoy some ok food. 

The atmosphere is really tough to beat if your goal is to have fun around lots of people trying to do the same.  Everything around here has style, makes you feel welcome and is a cool hangout.

The food...is meh. I ordered the meatloaf because I wanted to see if it could be better than my mom's.  It was  disappointing, but buying a couple beers in a bag (I think they were $2) made up for it...kinda."}
{"text":"I think the best thing about this place is the location. Its a Sam Fox restaurant so we had high expectations but were a but disappointed. Inside seating is different but bar and outside patio is much better.  The young service personnel were not the friendliest and service was slow even during a Wednesday afternoon at 4pm. Pretzel appetizer was the best on the menu, but not sure if we would return.  Fox has much better restaurants than this."}
{"text":"Went with the plan to have something great.  We have been to the Tempe location many times.  This location is walking distance so we cruised down.  We had a reservation for 6:30 and we did get a prompt seating.  Food was on point as usual.  Down side?  2.5 hours to get through dinner.  I am a 90 minute max guy.   Everything just drug on forever.  Oh well.  Still worth the trip."}
{"text":"It isn't an entire Vegas experience without stopping at culinary drop out. 

This Gastro pub style venue is really one of the hidden gems in the entire city. 

Gourmet bar food and classic cocktails with modern twist is seriously what I wake up for, in the endless abyss of techno blaring night clubs and over populated pool parties. 

This spot not only offers diverse food choices for any of your cravings ( burgers to seared tuna to jambalaya) but their cocktail program is unreal. 


Their lengthy beer list and particular cocktail menu is only surpassed by the impeccable service I received from Matt. He made my experience special and memorable all with a genuine smile and gracious presence. I will return for all of the above mentioned, and here's to hoping Matt and Asa are behind the bar again."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a surprise party for my sisters birthday. I had made reservations for 14 and I showed up about 15 mins early to get set up but was told by the girls up front I could not be seated until half my party had arrived. I am 8 months pregnant and standing even for 15 mins at this point isn't fun. She then said the bar was open seating and I could hang out there until half my party arrived. Again, I'm very pregnant and \"hanging out at the bar\" is not ideal. Honestly they could have just let me get seated. What saved the rest of my experience here was the DELICIOUS food and the awesome service our server Megan provided. This place is BUSY and she was calm and kept all the orders together and had drinks refilled and was extremely pleasant and accommodating. My only complaint would be the hostesses up front, smile a little more and try to be a little more accommodating because you set the tone for the restaurant. Beyond first arriving the rest of my experience was great again because of the food and our awesome server, I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Cool hip vibe.  Excellent bar and nice beer selection.  Wine Menu - so so.  Food was good but not \"outstanding\".  Great night life and fun outdoor seating.  I'd recommend."}
{"text":"AHHHH - I LOVE THIS PLACE.
Whenever someone goes to Phoenix, I always tell them to hit up Culinary Dropout.

Food - 
Best Prime Rib Dip Sandwich in the US.  Love it, can't order anything else.

Drinks - 
Marg on the rocks with a shot of Guinness Beer.  Can't even thinking about having margs any other way any more."}
{"text":"I still have dreams about the Monkey-Bread dessert!!!!!!!!!!

This place was pretty awesome in terms of ambiance, good vibes, cool live music, fun app's, a great and savory meatloaf, and an awesome dessert called: Monkey-bread!
This yummy goodness was ooooooey, gooey, and had ice cream on the side- Must I say more???? Give it a whirl and your tastebuds will thank you later and then you can go ahead and send me a thank you after you indulge in this lovely dessert!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was cool. Food was ok. Server had an attitude. I had the MAC cheeseburger, it was alright. My kids had the mac and cheese with apples and my other boy had the chicken fingers with fries. I have to say, the mac and cheese was the best thing we all had. To be honest, for the $65 price for lunch for the four of us, we have had much better food and better experience.

Update: Changed my star rating from a 3 to a 4 because they really do care about the customer and their experience. Thank you Henry for caring and reaching out to me. We will come back and ask for you."}
{"text":"Took the family out to this one- of- a- kind watering hole and restaurant as part of Valentine's Day treat. Aside from the rustic outside look, the ambiance was less formal but very welcoming and had an open and airy feel to it than the Scottsdale location. Although it's in keeeping with the area that's not upscale i.e. 'Snotts'dale.
Everyone seemed to enjoy it and the place was understandably busy. The play area outside with the four ping pong tables, bean bag toss, fooseball and shuffleboard has to be a nice touch. At the time we were one of the few to indulge in the activities but more and more patrons began to venture out and try it.
Since I was the one springing for this one however, I noted it was a bit pricey but not over the top. I say that considering the location they could have kept it down a smidge. Seems to me Sam hit the nail on the ear and skimmed the head.
I wouldn't say it's out of reach however and would be an easy fix if they addressed a couple of things. They need, with all the help they have, one person assigned to the Patio area for the activities, with nothing other than to help patrons take part in this unique, fun aspect to a nice place. We are a sporstsminded group and took our own ping pong paddles and batted it around before and after the meal for a bit.
The other thing is to direct people to try some activity and liven it up with something other than just sit around and chat. Great place for a date, groups(business/private) and sports minded people who are not just foodies but more multi dimensional. I suspect that Sam Fox has a very nice concept here and am inclined to do it again. It may be a good idea if the bartender 'Brittney' or someone as nice as her could periodically announce and promote the outside dining/activity and organize friendly competition that most people are kinda shy about on their own. Draw em out YKWIM!
Something like \" Hey for the more adventurous among our guests here, look out at the patio area and see if it appeals to ya. The activity person out there will hook you up......enjoy and please be sure to let us know how you liked it. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Shrimp Caesar is great! Grace the waitress is super genuine....which seems to be a hard thing to find in Scottsdale. I've been 3 or 4 times now... Its"}
{"text":"Honestly this is one of my favorite places in the area. All of their restaurants are seriously amazing. The vibe is welcoming and eclectic. The food is all original and super delicious. The pretzels and cheese are amazing and the kale Caesar actually makes me want to eat kale. The pork belly nachos are drool worthy. Last but not least my favorite drink in the entire state. The room service. Makes my heart sing"}
{"text":"This last weekend I was here with my family (5 of us). We got a table and ordered food. While eating our dinner my husband let me know the burger was really rare but being that he has worked in the restaurant business for a long time we did not complain. After dinner we all decided to play bags (cornhole) we got up from our dinner where we left our stuff just to have someone bus our table and give it away. Again, we did not complain and our server that night was super cool and continued to serve us over by the game. Half way through a game my husband says he feels sick from the food and goes to the bathroom. While waiting for him some people walk over to our bags game and the guy very rudely tells us we can't hold the board. We explain to him that my husband was in the bathroom and we will be playing shortly he then says \"I don't really care you can't hold the board\" I probably got snippy back and replied my husband is going to the bathroom just walk away when his girlfriend steps in and says \"you need to calm down\" the man causing a scene then let's me know he's the assistant general manager and he can do whatever he wants. He tells my party and I this multiple times before walking away. Strike three..... We will not be returning and will take our business elsewhere. Bad food bad communication and bad management."}
{"text":"Very fun place to go and enjoy! We bring our friends that come into town to visit, here for drinks. Lots of fun things to do, and a unique atmosphere. Haven't had a chance to eat here yet, but hope to soon!"}
{"text":"Overall great experience and great atmosphere....

My wife and I shared the prosciutto deviled eggs, the pretzel and provolone cheese fondue, and split the prime rib dip. I had a 20oz Upslope Brown Ale (Colorado) and my wife had a 20oz Flagstaff IPA. The beer and food was delicious. Our tab was $52.00. However I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the bread/roll that was used for the prime rib dip needed to be toasted longer to give it more of a crunch even after dipping it in au jus sauce. It turned out a bit soggy in our opinion. The server was very friendly but she was a bit swamped and some extra help for her and all the servers would've been good. See attached pictures of our food extravaganza! We'll come back again."}
{"text":"Great menu so much unique stuff. I have been here 5 or 6 times now and never have had a bad dish..everything has been perfect from the steamed mussels to the fried chicken (one of my personal favorites) tonight I had the grilled cheese slides. They were done to perfection. Crispy outside and a warn gooey center. Still have no idea how that kept the tomato crisp through cooking. The live music was also phenomenal! Would have give this 5 stars but the service was just not stellar slightly long waits with empty drinks and to take orders but I will be coming again!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food but I don't think that's why anyone comes here. 
Stick to the appetizers, order a few drinks and enjoy the ambiance. More of a cool hangout spot."}
{"text":"Wife and I went here for date night. Really relaxed atmosphere. There were a number of places to sit where one would be at a bar, fire pit, pingpong table or a dinner table. We came for the dinner table. We started with Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue, which needs to be eaten there every time. My wife had the Chili, which was not spicy but had a deep smokey flavor and bright tomato flavor.
For dinner I had the BBQ Pork Belly Nachos, which was big enough for two or three. Overall great service. The food took a while but it was packed. Contrary to other reviews we remarked that it was well staffed and we were able to have our servers attention when needed."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Vegas. By far. Come take a look, even if just to walk thru.
The waitstaff was AWESOME! 
The Fried Chicken was incredible-the batter was something like i have never tasted...needed NO sauce at all.
The pretzel and cheese fondue app was okay...but if an option just get the pretzels. The cheese is nothing special, very bland w no taste at all.
the view is what sets it off."}
{"text":"The food is awesome here! Great, friendly atmosphere! If you're looking for a great place to kick back with friends and enjoy the kind of tasty food that makes great company more enjoyable, this place hits the spot, to be sure!"}
{"text":"I've come here many times over the years. It is a fox concept. Always do a good job. Good drinks service and atmosphere. They have a small stage with live music. Friendly attentive staff and a good American Style menu with all the Staples. Worth checking out for a small corporate chain. Also has happy hour daily from 4 to 6 p.m."}
{"text":"We spent the afternoon walking around Scottsdale and stopping in places for a snack and a drink. This was probably my favorite place we stopped. Fun vibe, really good drinks and a great appetizer list. We had the nachos which were amazing. I would definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"When we were headed here our hosts described it as a place vampires might hang out. One look at the decor and you can see what they mean. The place is ensconced in purple velvet

By the time we arrived we'd already been on a tasting tour of Scottsdale and the surrounding area but we wanted to taste something on the CD menu. All I wanted was some vegetables! The husband suggested the Seared Tuna Salad ($14) with ginger vinaigrette, wasabi peas, and an assortment textural  and it was so good.  Totally hit the spot.  I'd eat that salad everyday.

I wanted to sample an interesting cocktail too so I perused the drink menu and discovered a gem. As a proud part-Peruvian seeing Pisco on a menu fluffs my feathers up. As a matter of fact my cousin proudly represents the brand Vinas de Oro Pisco.  Pisco, a strong colorless grape brandy is expertly processed turning out a libation that resembles a very smooth tequila in flavor and is the base for the drink. You add lemon, simple syrup, bitters and egg whites. It's refreshing and strong.  The Peruvian Press ($10) was a version of the more traditional Pisco Sour and it was delicious.  This is a sipping drink so take it slow. 

In MN when we say custard we're most likely talking about the creamier, fattier version of ice cream not the more classic version that's the consistency of a thick pudding. We were surprised, but not disappointed, when we dug into the Salted Caramel Custard ($7). The house made caramel corn that poured out the top of this glass was obscenely good. It was buttery, flavorful and stick to your teeth fresh. After, getting through barricade of popcorny goodness we were greeted by silky smooth custard. It tasted like salted caramel for sure. Next time I'd the Caramel Corn ($3) and skip the custard. 

I just sampled a bite of the Ricotta Gnocchi ($14) with sausage and mushrooms. The light, brothy creme sauce was perfectly seasoned. Delicious. I'd try it as a main course!"}
{"text":"My wife and I met her cousin and his wife for lunch on Saturday, January 9, 2016.  This was a very neat place!  There was indoor seating, but we decided to sit \"outside\" in a patio area.  The area was covered overhead, but was open air.  The outside temperature was very cool and the area that we sat in was equipped with over heaters as well as fire pits.

The seating selections were tables, booths, and then some sofa type lounges surrounding the fire pits.

The restaurant had some great local brews on tap.  I ordered a Kilt Lifter from Four Peaks Brewing (Tempe, AZ) and a Dale's Pale Ale from Oskar Blues Brewery (Longmont, CO).  Both were served very chilled and went down smooth!  For lunch, I went with Butternut Squash Cannelloni.  The plate was served with mushrooms, smoked shallot, caramelized fennel,
parmesan, and herb butter.  Inside the cannelloni was a butternut squash puree, and then there were chunks of very tender butternut squash served on top.  This entree was absolutely delightful!!!  There were so many flavors going on with each bite, I was in Heaven!  My wife ordered the Turkey Pastrami sandwich which she said was very good.  It must have been, because she finished the entire sandwich!

Great place, great location, great food, and great beer!  This place was a hit!"}
{"text":"I love Culinary Dropout! I've been to both AZ locations and both are good!
The service is always phenomonal and I love the food!  Pretzels and Fondue are definitely a must have.  The meat and cheese's are also good! I've had a few things there and all of them were delicious!  I can't wait to try more!"}

{"text":"I am typically wary of both Fox concepts and bigger chain establishments in Old Town, but there are a few I keep in my back pocket for fail-safe night out options. Culinary Dropout is one of them. The experience is always positive, the food is typically satisfactory and the drinks hit the spot.

The decor at this location is rustic, contemporary and lovely at the same time with a wide open space laced with wood accents. Live music is a nice touch and makes for a decent ambient sound when enjoying drinks with your party. I have really enjoyed the cocktails I've ordered here, which gives me confidence in their bartenders. Happy hour is great time to go with lower prices and decent options. Although I wasn't thrilled with the grill cheese sliders and their rubbery faux-american cheese aftertaste, but the salad of the day hit the spot. I've also had the burrata which was a true indulgence down to the last bite.

The staff has always been very friendly here whether it's behind the bar or table service. Even I have to admit this Fox concept is executed perfectly and is in my stand-by Old Town rotation."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix/Tempe area.

Yelpers, Culinary Dropout is the food adventure you've been waiting for.

The portions here are massive, and so is the venue. I think they may have converted an old warehouse at one point into this culinary haven. They have a MASSIVE indoor space with dozens of tables, and a huge bar. But it gets better...that space is DOUBLED with their outdoor space that has a roof, fans with misters, and so much more seats everywhere! 

But enough about this gorgeous space, let's talk about the food. This is delicious, flavorful new American cuisine with a southern flair and massive portions. 

If you're here with at least three other friends, I would recommend at least the pretzel buns with fondue. It's delicious but they're massive buns and fill you up pretty quickly. (You've been warned!)

I split the 36-hour rib and an order of the fried chicken with my girlfriend. Our waitress was kind enough to make each a half order and put them on multiple plates for us. Definitely didn't expect that, but it's always nice when it happens!

Let's talk about the ribs. They were amazing. Juicy, succulent -- they just fell from the bones. Packed with flavor from the seasoning and rub they use. I still dream about the ribs sometimes.

The fried chicken was pretty delicious as well, but it definitely didn't compare to the ribs.

If you're here with just one other person, I would suggest an appetizer (like the pretzel buns) and then just share the ribs. Maybe get a couple of drinks too, but that's all you need.

Seriously, I need to come back and try their entire menu.

It definitely also looks like they have space/rooms that could be used as rentals for big groups. Would definitely recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Great place to hang with friends and grab a drink.  The food is good too, not the best, but who cares when you are having fun!"}
{"text":"Did you guys know that 8 billion chickens are consumed every year here in the United States?

That has nothing to do with my review but now you know.  ;D 

I have always been a fan of Culinary Dropout and The Fox Restaurant Concepts.  I must admit that this location seems a lot more bougie than the Tempe location but they still have the same great food.  Anyways, let's jump into the review!

VELVET DEATH, $11 [Death's Door gin, Cointreau, Velvet Falernum, and Absinthe]:  I never had a drink at any of the Culinary Dropout locations that didn't get me buzzed.  The Velvet Death was no exception.  My vice of choice at CD is usually the Dropout Classic Mule but my lunchdates inspired me to try something new.  Velvet Death tasted of summer with its bright citrus notes.  After half a glass, I was feeling great!  An afternoon at the museum on an empty stomach was probably the culprit but hey, let's drink!

SOFT PRETZELS & PROVOLONE FONDUE,  $10.50 [with sea salt ]:  These are always a must and must be shared with the table.  Pillowy soft pretzels served with a mini cauldron of provolone cheese on top of a burning tea candle.  Just get these and dip everything into the fondue.

MA...THE MEATLOAF!?!, $15 [served with green bean, mashed potato, and gravy]:  That was a solid and classic meatloaf.  I do think Pioneer Woman's meatloaf is better so cook that ish at home.  I took my green beans and ate them like french fries after dipping them in some leftover provolone fondue.  Could this be the result of the Velvet Death?  Maybe.  Don't knock it until you try it.

So yes.  Culinary Dropout Scottsdale is a beautiful place with comfy couches and lots of good eats.  For me though, I rather go to the Tempe location.  They have games for all the hipster bruhs to play, yo!"}
{"text":"3.75 stars. My friend and I were new to the area and decided to try something different. We waited to be seated for about 45 minutes. The decor of the resturant is very interesting and I enjoyed the overall experience. Our waitor was great! The food was good and they have a selection you dont see to often...like the pretzels with fondue! I would recommend this place if you need to grab a bite because it is a different ambiance from most resturants."}
{"text":"Ambience was a little odd but ok.  We ordered the pretzels with the cheese fondue to start off with.  The cheese was cold but it eventually melted with the candle under it.  The pretzels were only hot on the top of the top layer no doubt from a heat lamp.  They were cold inside.  Otherwise they had a good flavor. 

For the main course I had the fried chicken.  The chicken was not worth the wait.  The French fries were burnt,  the Cole slaw was nasty, and the biscuit was cold,  although the butter was melted.  My wife had the prime rib and was not impressed either. 

The 2 stars are for our waitress.  She was really nice and she can't be responsible for the menu"}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner one night and it was just OK. I had the gorgonzola chicken salad, and it was SOAKED in dressing. I'm not someone who likes soaked lettuce, so this turned me off a bit. One person in my party got the jambalaya, and he thought it was decent. However, if you don't like spicy food, don't order this. He loves spicy food and this was pretty spicy for him. Other people got the chicken club, seared tuna salad, and prime rib dip. They all seemed happy with their selections."}
{"text":"They have really great service and it's a nice place. Mussels were great. But it's a little over priced for the over all selection and quality of the food."}
{"text":"Update: I was reached out to by the business manager who informed me happy hour is STILL on for Friday's. She went above and beyond to ensure our satisfaction  so we will definitely be returning for more happy hours!

Went on a Friday like we had previously for their happy hour. But apparently, \"happy hour is not available on weekends only M-TH.\" Since when a Friday a weekend? If so, why is it part of my workweek?! They should really update their website as it is misleading. Happy hour menu displays M-F. Service and food was also subpar to what we had been accustomed to here."}
{"text":"Best restaurant experience I've had in quite a while. The ultimate atmosphere combined with amazing food as well as a huge variety for all people. Will definitely be back to The Yard soon!"}
{"text":"Been to this location four or five times... Work lunch Sunday funday happy hour graduation  celebrations... The place is big enough to accommodate large groups has shuffleboard bean bags photo booth table tennis to entertain everyone.. Cocktails are nice but not light liquor imo...food is good pretzel balls are fun chicken meatballs are tasty... The mussels and toast is also a good  choice... I think entree wise I've probably had the western burger and the most often.... Valet is convenient and cheap good selection of beers on tap and liquor options... I usually do mystery grab bag on Sundays random disgusting beer and shot for five bucks"}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere! Great location!

Room for improvement: even if the bar is busy please acknowledge guests. I would rather be greeted and wait 20 minutes to be served than wait 10 minutes and be ignored. Also, when a server is being cut and transferring the table to a new server, try to make it a seamless translation and not seem \"rushed to get out.\" 

Love the Smash Irishman drink!"}
{"text":"My wife and I split a bunch of food (nachos, soft pretzels, deviled eggs, and some bread/cheese combo) and everything was great.  Also ordered a Phoenix Shandy(?) which was recommended by our waitress.  It was a nice, light, refreshing drink.  We played some corn hole, and ping pong which was fun.  I was a little worried going into the bar since it's near (actually on) the ASU campus that we would be the \"old people\" but it was a great mix of young and old.  The staff was very friendly, and outgoing.  Would strongly recommend that anyone in the Phoenix area make this place a priority.  Wish we had more time to spend there, great way to kill a bunch of hours."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was everything I wanted in a dining experience. It's located inside the Hard Rock so obviously a great layout of rock memorabilia. Staff was casual but nice and took good care of us. 

Drinks: ours took a little while but without asking our waiter gave us a complimentary mule to make up for it. I ordered the Smashed Irishman and my friend got the Soiled Dove. All three were amazing, super fresh, great quality. 

Food: THE THAI CHILE WINGS. I was iffy on what to get because a lot looked good but I'm glad I got these. Probably the best wings I've ever had. Friend got a burger and she said that was one of the best she's had as well. I'd want to come back with a lot of people to get one of everything and get to taste more. 

Dessert: Chocolate S'mores Pudding.....I mean do i have to say anything else? So so so good.

Prices: obviously the prices were not cheap but for the quality and location, I didn't mind at all. 

All in all I left full and happy, wishing I didn't live in Texas so I could come here all the time. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Last meal before leaving Arizona. All white meat fried chicken was crispy and juicy. Had a little vanilla bean ice cream with caramel sauce for dessert to cool the palate. Not that my meal wasn't good enough on its own it was made that much better by the lovely bar maid Alex."}
{"text":"I have been there 5 times and every time my food takes a very long time to come out!!! If you are going with a good group of people and want to enjoy each other's company and some good appetizers I recommend but be ready to be there for a while!!!!"}
{"text":"Cool spot and nice atmosphere but the service could be better.  They always have alot of bartenders and servers on but they forget orders and take forever to get back to you. I will go back in hopes they will change"}
{"text":"So this is probably the weirdest place for food best for drinks and entertainment. Their valet is terrible when I pulled up I got out of the car and the valley gave me a ticket and then walked away for a few minutes meanwhile my car is running and the door open with no valet near it. What's to keep somebody from stealing my car while waiting to be parked? Then my friends and I go back to valet when we're leaving and there's a bunch of drunk guys just hanging out with the valet so it's unclear where the valet is so I go around the drunk group of guys give my ticket to the valet he gets my car brings it over said bye to my friends and once again leaves the car door open and running by itself and one of the drunk guys gets in my car and revs my cars engine. I was livid. Some drunk stranger in my car I'm so upset with the poor service and lack of respect Culinary Drop out has.  this was already my least favorite place because of the parking situation only being valet but now I will never recommend this place to my friend and family."}
{"text":"Hey guys - I am updating my review to a 4 star. I haven't been back since my previous review, but I will say that I am always impressed when a manager/owner reaches out and asks to improve your experience. The manager/owner offered for us to come in at lunch to ensure that we had a great experience. Overall, I was sitting at a 3.5 star review, but as we all know that is not an option in the Yelpsphere so I rounded down to a 3. Since hearing the response from the restaurant I have decided to round up. Well done manager/owner. :)"}
{"text":"We came in tonight for the 1st time and it was 3.5-4 star worthy but I'm saying 5 star because of our service! Ray (Rashaun, from the reciept) was so great!! Since we'd never been there, he suggested some meats and cheeses and the pretzels with provolone fondue. He explained the cheeses we weren't familiar with and recommended his favorites and which ones were crowd pleasers etc... he wasn't pushy or irritated when we decided not to have more food and just go for dessert. He was definitely what you'd want in a server and they should be glad they have him on staff. Actually, the other servers that ran our food were all very friendly as well. It seems like a well oiled machine. The only kind of weird thing was the staff didn't seem to have a defined uniform so it was kind of hard to tell who worked there but it wasn't a problem. I mean, who hasn't worn a red shirt to Target and had someone ask you where garbage bags are? If I had a complaint, it would be that the meats (we had salumi and procuitto) and cheese ( hard cheddar and soft with a truffle oil) were a bit pricey to not come with bread or crackers. It was extra and had a balsamic drizzle on it which overpowered the flavors of the cheese. The pickled peppers were forgettable but the deviled eggs were good as well as the Bourbon black bottom pie with caramel sauce and homemade whipped cream."}
{"text":"Great food & environment & restaurant but every time I go the service always takes longer than usual, whether if it's just first greeting the table or coming back for refills & even the food has taken long to arrive. Other than that the food & drinks are awesome. They just need some help with the service & they have a lot of staff so it shouldn't be that hard."}
{"text":"Stopped by Saturday for one drink before Little Cleo's opened at 4pm.  A group of seven, three of us started at the outside bar and when another couple came one of our group asked at the hostess station if we could to a high table right behind us. She said that would be fine.  We understand how this works and we wouldn't have just moved what checking.  Another one of the party went to ask for drinks at the bar, and he couldn't have been more rude when he told her 'you can't order here'. We had to wait for our server.  So no drinks and when a server (ours?  We'll never know) finally stopped by the table she said \"you know you can't just sit here. You need to be seated\".  We said yes, we understood and told her we had checked with the hostess.  She walked away. Still no drinks so one person goes to to bar to ask for drinks again, telling the bartender we have no server, and the first guy went back up and told the group of hostesses that a server yelled at us for sitting at that table.  We were confused since we tried to do everything correct and we had suggested this spot to our friends.  A nice ending though because a great guy came over, maybe a floor manager, and said three of the drinks we ordered where on him for the trouble.  I'm still baffled as to why two separate people were so rude.  It was busy but no more than any other Saturday.  My friends won't be back and we'll avoid the server that acted so put out that we were there. BTW Little Cleo's was fabulous!  Sam couldn't have been nicer and had no trouble getting us drinks and food!"}
{"text":"I'd say 3 1/2 stars.,,, Dined here because it was convenient staying at HRH with bachelorette party of 21! The food was decent we had the fried chicken which was crispy and juicy, the sweet corn ravioli was super delicious but  prime rib sliders were a bit on the salty side!"}
{"text":"Food seems a little over priced, it's decent. But nothing special or worth the price. The meat loaf was too salty almost indelible. I've also had the prime rib dip which was a little better."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but I'll NEVER go again for dinner. I went to Culinary Dropout on a Saturday night -- there was a live band, but they were WAY too loud, and pretty terrible. We had to shout at our waitress, and still she had trouble hearing us and vice versa. I literally couldn't have a conversation with the person sitting across the table from me.

The \"vibe\" was interesting. Half the fun was looking at all of the obscurely dressed \"alternative\" crowd that was eating there. Many of the patrons seemed to give off the \"my world is a dark abyss and my parents just don't understand me\" aura. Unfortunately, I could not share my quippy observations with anyone else at my table, given the noise. The decor was pretty abhorrent, and the restaurant was uncomfortably cold (it was nighttime in early February), given that they left all the doors and windows open.

I had the trout, which was very tasty. Additionally, the pretzel bites with fondue appetizer was VERY good. At the end of the day though, I'd rather eat at Wendy's were I can actually converse, than some hipster joint where I can't hear anything other than a jazz musician (who didn't seem to fit the scene... he was the only non-white I could spot in the crowd) eating the microphone and playing the harmonica (poorly) at 10,000 deciles."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about culinary dropout when I first moved to PHX. It's a really cool vibe, I love the vibe probably the most. Really reminds me of Austin, TX. The food was ok, nothing to really jump per the moon for and the price was not consistent with the taste... I had the fried chicken, it was cool, like I said nothing over the top in my opinion. Service was really spot on, the waiter came around often with suggestions about beer, cocktails and food. Nice open layout with the yard to play cornhole and a ton of TV's to catch games. I would come back, probably for college football."}
{"text":"Hung out here on our last night in Vegas. Actually, we came twice in the same day. We switched hotels and ended up at the Hard Rock for our last night. After checking into the hotel we had lunch here at the bar. We got beers and the pretzel fondue. Delicious! Then we came back for Happy Hour at the bar as well. Great deals!!! We got more beers and grilled cheese sliders. Also yummy! The atmosphere is really fun and laid back. Their wait staff and bartenders don't wear uniforms so it's kind of funny seeing them serve people in regular clothes. I have an obsession with outdoor seating - this place has a great patio with couches and firepits that overlook the Hard Rock's pool area. Great find on our last day in vegas!"}
{"text":"Nestled into a posh shopping district of Scottsdale Culinary Dropout offers a little flair to the upper crust. A variety of hand crafted cocktails are available and are only $10 each if my memory serves me correctly. 

It was a Saturday night and I arrive with my party of three after eight pm. We waited in a VERY packed bar area for over an hour. Once seated it was pretty nice. 

It was a celebratory dinner and we tried almost all the appetizers. The cheese and meat selection are particularly impressive. I'm a cheese fan and CD does  has an excellent selection. The pretzels and cheese where also a good app to share among hungry friends who had been drinking at the bar for more than an hour before dinner.

It was a nice place. I'd err on the side of saying it was a little to \"Ed Hardy\" for my taste with patrons trying to look \"rock-n-roll\", but that's the vibe and you know that going in. 

Good food, good time. Minus the long wait."}
{"text":"Had a great time! The atmosphere was fabulous and the food was great! Loved the live band and decor!! Fried Chicken was fabulous and the drinks were creative and delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. Next time we hope to stay longer and have larger appetites so we can try more of their eclectic menu. We ordered the pretzel app which was delicious but too big for 2 people and we had to cancel our frittata because it really filled us up. The kale salad is fantastic especially with some roasted salmon. Love the vibe here."}
{"text":"It was still Restaurant Week, and my long-anticipated introduction to Culinary Dropout was about to occur.  After it was all over, I was pleasantly pleased by all I saw and ate.  Amid the fitting sounds of hard rock, the decor of the restaurant is very casual, but seating on a banquette and upholstered chair was comfortable, and servers were very friendly, efficient, and accommodating.  A request for a different salad dressing was immediately granted.

I began with Yesterday's Soup, which changes by the day.  To my relief, this was not like the leftovers of a college cafeteria's previous day's rejected offerings ground up and mixed with broth.  Ginger Soup was on tap on my dining day.  And, this colorful soup literally took my breath away.  I figured out why when I found out from my server that it contained Cilantro Jalapeno Pepper Sauce.  The soup was not very hot but quite spicy, but soon I got used to it and found the distinct taste of ginger to be intriguing.

Next up was a House Salad with many mixed greens and a generous supply of good Sherry Vinaigrette Dressing.

For my entree, I selected Ma . . . The Meatloaf!?!  Why it is so named I have no idea.  But this was great, very hot meatloaf with a ketchup coating accompanied by really fresh French Style Green Beans and Mashed Potatoes with Brown Gravy.  I also tried the Coleslaw, which was non-creamy and slightly sweet, while Diane enjoyed somewhat odd-looking dark brown but quite tasty and well-made Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Honey Biscuits.

For dessert we had a Chocolate Toffee Tart and Salted Caramel Custard with homemade Caramel Popcorn on top.  Both were excellent, including the sweet popcorn.

It was fun to face and watch the chefs at work in the very open kitchen.  When we left, we were very full from the large portions.  Because the menu lists so many intriguing items that I want to try, including oysters and white shrimp by the piece, we will most definitely return fairly soon for additional meals--and will continue to do so if Diane keeps up her winning streak at the Hard Rock's slot machines and draws additional player's coupons for 2 for 1 entrees at Fu!"}
{"text":"Culinary Dropout is an exceptional Fox restaurant. I've tried a LOT of the menu, and am yet to find something less than fantastic. Every dish and drink seems...I don't know, made just for you. A lot goes into each dish, and it's worth it to come eat here."}
{"text":"Omg omg! We ate here one night with friends before Ellismania, I had the meatloaf and let me say it was soooooo good! I know, I know it's just meatloaf but trust me I've ate some that is just disgusting! It came with green beans and mashed potatoes with gravy. Mmmmmm!! Oh and a Bloody Mary which was ! Will come back and try other items because my friends food looked amazing as well and the said it was. We were seated on the patio area which was lovely and totally made you feel comfortable and happy or maybe that was the vodka. Either way I ate, I enjoyed, and I will be bacK!"}
{"text":"My friends planned my going away party here and the food was great!! Definitely get the pretzels if you go there!"}
{"text":"Very tasty appetizers - house made chips&dip and pretzels with cheese fondue are my go to choices. And although slightly pricier than I usually prefer, the cocktails are great - my fav is 'el matador'.

If I had to list 10 things to eat for the rest of my life, the turkey pastrami sandwich on the house made pretzel roll with fresh cut fries is very high on my list! 

The evenings fill this place up pretty quickly and if you are looking for a quiet meal on Friday or Saturday night, the live band may disrupt your plans, but at least you get some good tunes!"}
{"text":"Although I was here for a work social, it met all my expectations and the outdoor area is really comfortable. It's just a great location with a lot of space, very open, airy, and comfortable. Perfect for large gatherings, reunions, etc."}
{"text":"Wowza! Elevated casino/pub food to be sure!

I came here on a Thursday night, had a not-too-sweet signature cocktail, a Burrata appetizer and the Pretzels with cheese fondue and it was amazing!!! The atmosphere was cool but unpretentious, there was a guy singing and playing guitar on stage but I didn't want to strangle him... overall, a way better experience than I thought I would have had at the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"We had 15 people for a business meeting the next day. The servers were attentive but not in the way. The food was amazing!! It was a little loud but we did not have trouble hearing each other. 
Working with Lindsey to plan the meal was so easy!"}
{"text":"I love the culinary dropout locations in the Phoenix area so when I found out there's one in Vegas I got super excited to share with my friends from Boise. I hyped this place up a lot and it delivered on expectations! The service was good and the food was great! Definitely recommend the French dip, the pierogies appetizer, the grilled cheese, and the grilled chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"I'm not giving 5 stars bc I feel like there's ALWAYS going to be room for improvement, but this place really blew us away. We weren't expecting much. We were in town on business and just picked a placed randomly on yelp. They didn't have the steak for my co worker but did a special order Asian infused skirt steak for him---- AND he said he was in the mood for chili fries so the kind waitress Karen said she would make it happen. The soup that night happened to be chili, they had cheese and fries---- BEYOND delicious!
We were a rather large, loud and knit picky group. She joked with us, did everything we needed and was prompt. 
We got an array of things from the menu. I got a burger--- sorry can't remember which one bc I had had 6 drinks at this point. (Acai mojito was smooth & alcohol stuffed!) 
We were considering a drive back but the $100 roundtrip cab ride was the only thing that made us decide to stay local to downtown Phoenix. If I'm ever in the Scottsdale area again.... Culinary dropout will be a stop without a doubt!"}
{"text":"The chicken was amazing but the pretzel not so good. I didn't expect it to be hard and not so moist. Over all great atmosphere and amazing service!"}
{"text":"Enjoy delicious comfort food and one of a kind cocktails, and a live band.  Culinary Dropout is one my favorite restaurants when visiting Tempe AZ. Ribs and fried chicken are my favorites!"}
{"text":"I'm bumping this up to a 4 but I would give 3.5 if I could. The place is big, nice, well lit, and warm enough even at night in the winter. Service is good.

Started with the prosciutto deviled eggs, which I thought were really good, and the roasted beets, which I thought were too simple and disappointing (I would skip them in the future).

Thought the sweet potato kale salad was really great, with a nice amount of goat cheese that was not overwhelming. I do wish they put more strips of sweet potato in the salad, but overall portion size was good.

The grilled chicken club was delicious. Accompanying fries were not very good. I would substitute a different side in the future.

I thought the drink prices were all pretty high. I tried the tap wine - would definitely skip it in the future. Just tasted... Muddled.

This place gets so packed during the summer. I'm glad I could enjoy it without the crowd. I recommend grabbing a jacket during the cool months and giving this place a try."}
{"text":"FOOD MADE FROM SCRATCH. Food took a good 40 minutes to come out (to be fair we had a group of 10) The food was delicious, the sea food is fresh and the desserts delightful"}
{"text":"I attended a fitness expo at the hotel and thought I would have zero options for decent quality, reasonably healthy, or good-tasting food...one of the 3.

I'd been to this hotel several times and had never come here until recently.

My first meal was the GORGONZOLA CHICKEN SALAD ($14 butter lettuce, radicchio, arugula, fennel, smoked almond, tart cherry) and I all but licked my bowl clean.  The ingredients were fresh seeming, it wasn't drowning in dressing, and I savored every bite having lunch after one of my workouts.

My second meal there were the bomb-ass THAI CHILE CHICKEN WINGS ($12 cashew, toasted sesame, cabbage, lime).  The wings were heavily slathered but what they were bathing in was the most interesting concoction of lime and sesame, very intense and very tasty.

Both times my table was approached with the cheeky-cool, hey we're all in Vegas kinda attitude, chill and like, hey, it's too hot for anything but being nice.  I liked it.

The inside if nice and ACed but if you want to hear the bump of Rehab and sit in a warm desert breeze, the outside might be for you.

I would definitely return here and for sure check out their AZ locations."}
{"text":"Dear Provolone Fondue, I want to eat you all day, every day and I don't want to stop when the bowl is empty...I want to lick you clean and then start on another!  If I didn't care about my sexy curves, I would eat every meal here and drink Room Services while lounging in a big arm chair, poolside with misters cooling me off.  I have loved every item I have tried.  The service has been excellent!  P.S. If you are a cheese enthusiast, go here, now and get yourself the fondue!"}
{"text":"I had the salmon. It was delicious and serving size was small. Friend had kale salad. It had way more kale than romaine. Other friend had grinder, she loved it. We had deviled egg. Three halves come with an order for $3. Also had some white cheddar cheese. 

We saw the seafood place next door and now we really want to try that out. 

Friend said this was the least favorite of hers of the fox restaurants in the metro area."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend for Valentine's day. We made reservations for 730pm. When we arrived we asked to sit on the patio, the host told me he'd text me in about 5 minutes and we went to the bar to wait. 20 minutes later I went back to him to ask about the seat. He didn't know what I was talking about and had to re-look me up. They then immediately sat us. 

I ordered the meat loaf and tomato soup, she ordered salmon. The soup was awesome. My meatloaf was really good, but the mashed potatoes were watery and cold. The green beans were cold as well. The prices are a bit high ($15 for a single slice of meatloaf and a small cold pile of green beans and mashed potatoes.) 

Her salmon was weird as it sat on what tasted and looked like oatmeal, but she seemed to like it. Our waiter (William) whom never greeted us or checked on us, was too busy socializing and taking pictures of tables, to even ask if she wanted a wine refill or if I wanted a beer refill. He continued to socialize and BS after he took my card for about 20 minutes before I got it back. 

My suggestion to the restaurant: keep your food hot, your customers drinks full and maybe invest in those vibrating pagers rather than offering a \"text message\".

The valet guys were cool though...

My suggestion to other customers: don't."}
{"text":"What a surprise!  From the outside, this place looks like an empty, small, cold hanger.  There are several entry ways, but the entrance we came in from was on the bathroom side.  A long hallway and looking down it seemed like the walk of shame hallway.

You get past that hallway and this place opens up!!!  its huge with many corn hole games, tennis tables, and a whole lot of seating.

This place is a bar with only appetizer food.  Do not expect to get a steak dinner or even a juicy cheeseburger.  Come here to really chill and hang out with beer, wine, or cocktails.  For me I go straight for the cocktails.  i think I ended up drinking 6 classic mules.  But no one was counting.

I played a round of corn hole and lost but who cares!  I had a drink in my hand!

Great spot.  Only reason I give this visit a 4 instead of a 5 is because I ordered my second mule and didnt get it until 15 min later and 3 reminders.  How'd I remember that?  I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ate here before jumping on the road home. I had the Kentucky Hot Brown, and my wife had the Cap n Crunch french toast! Both plates were excellent and perfect sizes. The dishes they use are new, but rustic looking, the place looks this is where you want to eat after a long night of running around the dessert looking for strippers and cocaine! The service was a highlight for sure, out waitress (easy on the eyes) smiled at every interaction, and was very attentive. We enjoy staying at the Hard rock and will eat here again."}
{"text":"Best service I've ever had! Our servers name was JAMIE, always ask for her when you go The management and everything was absolutely amazing. Outstanding food. The general manager Desmond was very nice and involved. I'm in the Industry so I only expect the best! Hands down one of the best restaurants I've been to!!"}
{"text":"Their fried chicken was awesome!  I would rate their fried chicken with 5 stars!  Unfortunately, my friend ordered the fried chicken, and I could only taste a sample.  I was stuck with their incredibly dry ribs (dry?  for a signature item?!?  oh boy!)...

Back to their chicken... wow!  Sooo juicy and perfectly spiced.  Quite possibly the best fried chicken I have eaten in a long time (I'm not a fried chicken eater btw...)

I am probably staying at Hard Rock (or the Cosmo, but I want to check out the Rehab Pool Party...) when I return in July, and if I eat here, I will have the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I'm from Vegas, so its absolutely awesome to have you guys here! Great, calm service. Awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Well well well obviously this place is super popular, but for us this was our first time and we couldn't have been more surprised by how amazing Culinary Dropout truly was! 
Because of all the great tips and reviews found on Yelp we decided to get the BBQ Pork belly Nachos and the Soft Pretzel & Provolone Fondue and man oh man you guys were totally right! These dishes were soooo tasty and just overall fun to munch on while watching Sunday football! Once we were completely satisfied with the great food and amazing service we got to enjoy ourselves with all the fun activities they offer including: cornhole (bean bag toss), shuffleboard, ping pong, and even foosball! My girlfriend and I had so much fun discovering this place with my parents!   We will definitely be back to this super fun, tasty, and overall awesome place they call Culinary Dropout! 10/10"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Tempe, hands down. We've been here three times and will make sure we bringe visitors and out of towners  here. It's fun, drinks, ambience, games, tvs, music and great times rolled into one night. You won't go wrong here. Great for an adult birthday gathering."}
{"text":"Worst service and ripped off by waitstaff! Wow.  Trouble getting food order taken, okay, she's busy. Charged other cards with my order. When this was pointed out to her, she got huffy.  I paid cash for both parties, she never returned change ($40 for  a $38 tab), her tip would have been greater than $2, we were part of a large party. Then she took my food and drinks away before I was finished. I was standing right in front of her. When I said something, she shrugged.  This morning we learned the credit card was charged too.  Guess her tip was more like fourty. My daughter writes for a travel blog and local mags. I sincerely hope this place makes things right. Worst waitress ever waiting on food service people. Poor choices were made!"}
{"text":"omg the food was amazing the service was great as well everything was just great no complaints"}
{"text":"Culinary dropout certainly lives up to the hype. No matter what the occasion or what you order, this place delivers. The pretzels are really good and the cheese it's comes with is second to none. 
The service is really good and is quick...even when it is packed. 
You will need to ensure you have a reservation, as it is a really popular spot. 
If you are just visiting for the winter, this is a spot that is worth the trip into old town!"}
{"text":"I ate here 3 times while staying at the Hard Rock for 5 days, it was definitely the high light of the hotel for me.  I highly recommend the Turkey Pastrami sandwich, a friend of mine liked the meatloaf so much he had it twice.  Pretty good beer selection too."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of visiting Culinary Dropout in Tempe this past week. The restaurant is huge and has a really cool vibe- you won't want to leave the comfortable seating. There are many areas for friends to gather and just catch up. It's a perfect location for larger parties too! The staff is abundant and we were extremely lucky to have Joel as our waiter extraordinaire! He guided us through the eclectic menu and we were not disappointed with our choices of BBQ Pork belly nachos, chicken Gorgonzola salad, kale salad and chopped salad! The nachos are a must and ample portion to share! When it was time to go Joel packages up my husbands leftover chopped salad and we noticed he wrote on container what was inside and the date. My husband was really impressed with such a simple detail that I'm the past would save us from headache of looking through your leftover containers to find \"your\" food. We complimented him on this detail and he said he does it because its important to know what's in container and when it was made! We'll definitely be back to Culinary Dropout and hope we can get Joel as our waiter!"}
{"text":"The Tempe location is pretty large & the yard is awesome! We always have great servers- always so nice! 

I've had the turkey pastrami & liked it a lot! I wasn't a fan of the cole slaw, as it's got a little kick to it! 

I've also had the meatloaf- which is DELICIOUS!!! I liked the chicken club, but it wasn't my favorite. 

The pretzel balls for an appetizer is great, but the nachos are TO DIE FOR!!!"}
{"text":"The Scottsdale location is just as cool as the Tempe one, but it's smaller. I still love it & I have had great servers here as well as Tempe! 

The nachos are delicious!!! Next time, I think we might just get those to go- because they are THAT good! 

The kids mac & cheese is tasty as well. I believe it has provolone cheese in it, and it really puts it above every other Mac & cheese I've had! Ever. The kids enjoyed it, as well as the adults at the table!"}
{"text":"Before seeing Magic Mike Live, you need a solid base.

Walked right into Culinary Dropout and was blown away by how big the space is!! Why nobody was taking advantage of the spectacular bar seating right up front was mind blowing. But it might have had something to do with the fact that their wasn't anyone working behind said bar. Details, details.

We sat towards the back at a giant table that fit all the foods. We went big ordered the fondue and pretzels, pierogis, and the smoked salmon. All of the above dishes were super rich and decadent. You get a lot of bang for your buck with those soft pretzels. I was able to wrap them up to go in the hopes of using them for little sliders at home. Alas, they were forgotten by me at the table but it's all good because you can't take food or drink from the outside world into the show. A few glasses of Sauvignon Blanc rounded out the whole experience.

The food at Culinary Dropout was memorable, the service was casual, and the overall vibe was exactly what I didn't know I needed before heading into Magic Mike Live.

Thank you Culinary Dropout. I'm not sure I could have done it without you."}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but good things about this place and had to try it out. My wife and I visited this place before a concert. We walked in and it wasn't to busy. It seemed pretty, cool, hip and trendy. The waitress was quick and was super friendly. We tried the pretzels and cheese and man, hands down amazing! I had to make myself stop to make sure I could actually eat dinner. I got the grilled chicken sandwich and my wife got the prime rib dip. The food was pretty good, I wouldn't say it was anything to write home about. I did find myself telling my wife several times that it was almost a very hipster place. I was almost feeling out of place. The atmosphere, awesome waitress, and the appetizer made this place great. Ide def. head back maybe with a group of friends next time since I can see its more set up for larger groups."}
{"text":"Great vibe--even in the middle of the day. Staff super friendly. Cool atmosphere--lots of spaces and different seating options to suit any preference. Oh yeah--and tasty food."}
{"text":"There are soooooo many BETTER choices in this area ...caveat: the Tempe location is much better, this location lacked SERVICE and the food, while good/ok, doesn't make up for the piss poor service.

Biggest issue was that our waitress was wearing a TUBE TOP that she kept adjusting?! That's just creepy behavior for the person touching your food/drinks?!  Though, she didn't \"touch\" much because she kept disappearing?!  She didn't check to see if we wanted drink refills, and someone else brought our food ...but she didn't check in to see if it was right ...which it wasn't."}
{"text":"Well Fox Concepts has done it again! I went for my second time with my husband for lunch . I had yesterdays soup , Minestrone soup with Italian sausage and he had the Cheeseburger.  The Cheeseburger was the best i ever had , it topped Flemming's cheeseburger, if you could imagine. The fries are thin cut and perfectly seasoned , not too salty. The soup , oh man, had roasted veggies and the perfect amount of fresh northern beans and lil Italian sausage meatballs. I am for sure going to figure out how to master the recipe."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times since they opened . The atmosphere is good , weekends are crowded. Honestly favorite day to go is Sunday for Brunch or lunch. This would be a good place for a birthday celebration. There is plenty to try and to do , that you just want to stick around all day. Perfect place for day drinking. : )"}
{"text":"Great spot inside the Hard Rock. Park at the garage off Harmon for fastest walk to the restaurant. 
Had lemonade and prime rib dip with fries. Attentive wait staff and super friendly staff all around. 
The prime rib dip came on a roll that was toasted perfectly on the inside and had a soft exterior. Au jus was good. Fries were excellent. 
No complaints at all."}
{"text":"My review is based off of the service and my friends meal choices.

Our server was horrible. Didn't check up on us once, super late with delivering my drink, and even spilled my drink onto my friends phone that was sitting on the table. One would think she'd go grab  more napkins, NOPE! She walked away and never returned. 

Our food took almost an hour to be ordered and prepared. This is quite insane for a breakfast with almost an empty restaurant. 

I ordered a lunch item and it was pretty good. My fiends all ordered breakfast and everything was bad. The French toast was cold, the eggs were cold and the bacon was super greasy, and cold."}
{"text":"A relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff make this a nice spot. Live music and decor is nice as well. The food left MUCH to be desired.  I ordered some antipasti and melted provolone which was ok. The fried chicken left much to be desired.  I think they did not \"clean\" the chicken before they fried it and much of it was un-edible. The biscuit was cold as were the mashed potatoes.  With so many other options in Vegas skip this one."}
{"text":"Man, I love this place. Seriously. 

The decor is awesome.  The huge wingback chairs.  Bench seats.  Leather couches.  Chandeliers.  The wallpaper.  The nook where the band plays up front.  The bar.  Heck, even the people are pretty. ;)

I love their pretzel bites and the meat and cheese boards.  All delicious.  I had a bite of the meatloaf and I gotta tell ya, didn't love it.  I'm honestly not a huge meatloaf fan so I'm not a great judge, but I didn't even feel that the green beans were very delicious.  (That's okay by me though, I would never order the meatloaf.)

I had the red blend of the wine and it was really yummy, my friends all did mixed drinks or beer - all were satisfied.  

There has only two things I was dissatisfied with in the two times I've been.  1.) Convenience of parking...(just valet).  2.) The service on my second visit was terrible.  There were 6-7 of us all having cocktails, but not loud by any means.  Our waiter wanted nothing to do with us.  He failed to explain that the meet and cheese that my two friends ordered would be on one plate.  Typically that WOULD be self explanatory, unless two people order it separately not sitting next to one another.  That was awkward when one person ate the food for two people.  When asking for the other individuals food the waiter rolled his eyes and quickly explained they were both obviously served on one board.  Could have been good information to know ahead of time.  My only point from my rant is, if you don't want to deal with groups in social settings serving may not be the occupation for you.  As a friendly group of people we're never a pain to serve and are always happy to tip! :)

I have no doubt I will be back to Culinary, maybe I'll give the one in Phoenix a try - it looks like it has a pretty cool vibe to it. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips! Perfect orange juice and good service. Music is terribly loud and lots of totally drunk people in the day, view of pool and REHAB."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the valley. It's incredible. The food was perfect and the vibes of the restaurant were awesome."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I ordered the prime rib dip for my main dish but also ordered a mixed cocktail and different appetizers beforehand. The pretzel dip was amazing! I would definitely come back, would get prime rib again but fried chicken looked great. Definitely make reservations! This place was crazy busy!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation on Open Table for 4, and requested outdoor seating, which we received with no problem. There was a very small dinner crowd there at 5:30, which was a relief, as this was our pre Magic Mike Live! dinner & drinks soiree.
The patio is a great use of space, and the view of the pool is nice.  Oh and the $2.95 mystery beer in a paper bag is always the first thing I order. That was fun! I've heard that they once had a 32 ounce paper bag mystery beer, which blew my mind! You bargain hungry drinkers are with me on this. No 32 ouncer this time, just the expected Busch light!

The menu has some upscalish choices as well as some usual pub type fare. I had the reuben, which was pretty tasty and a good sized portion. Everyone was mostly happy with their appetizers and meals. I tried a friend's teriyaki chicken wings, and it was excellent! Drink prices are a little steep, as to be expected.  We had to wait too long to pay and have our checks returned. That probably won't keep me from coming back, but it's something to consider."}
{"text":"Another great experience brought to you by a \"dropout\" Harvard or not Culinary dropout is amazing ! The vibe here is super chill and friendly. Every time I've been here they have amazing music. Def not top 40 in such a good way. 

The waitress I had was super aware of us and always was bringing refills right when we needed them. The kids played ping pong and had a good time. 

The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 was because of the table around the fire pit. Super relaxed outdoor feel. It's really cozy when you're hanging out and talking. But when your food comes I feel like Mia Khalifia having to bend over to eat my food. Mildly uncomfortable. It didn't  sabotage my experience. It just wasn't a 5 star experience. 

Good food and great vibes.  Will recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up on food, service and ambience.  Pricing was a bit stiff for what you got but other than that almost 5 stars.

This is a place you could come and hang out for hours not just stop by and grab a bite to eat"}
{"text":"I had a good experience here.  We had about 16 people and we were seated very quickly.  I forgot the name of my order but it was great.  I think it was the prime rib with au jou dip.  I would defintely come back to try something new.  I hope they put an orange peel in my old fashion this time though."}
{"text":"Been here about 3 times (comps) and every time I come here food  comes out cold. One time even, I had a date send back her steak because it was under cooked  and it still came out cold. Lol

 Cool concept but they seem to be lacking with their attention to details."}
{"text":"11 of us ( and a toddler) came here today to celebrate a birthday. I had the grilled chicken club and it was DELICIOUS!! Others in our party had: turkey pastrami sandwich, pub burger, salmon kale salad, and French dip. And all said they were very very good. We also had to have the pretzels and fondue cheese for an appetizer. It was good but I wish the cheese had maybe some spice, jalapeño maybe?, to it as it was kind of bland. We came at 2pm and it was still really busy but we were able to snag a cornhole game. The only bad things I have to say is our server forgot some things when we asked for them special but it was busy and there were 11 of us with only one server. And I'm guessing he was a manager but another guy that was bringing out food was quite rude when THEY had messed up one of our guests orders. Other than that we will definitely be back, the food was great!"}
{"text":"Loved the food!!! Cool atmosphere, fun games and the fondue was delicious! Our waiter James went above and beyond to make sure we got all we wanted! Will definitely return"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  The weather in March is great, so the outside seating was perfect.  There were still TV's outside so you could watch all the March Madness you wanted to.   However, I will warn you, the patio is next to the pool.  Great scenery but there were a massive group of drunk guys sitting next to us doing typical drunk dude things. Not their fault and they did a great job of policing the behavior when it got out of hand. 

The server, Ben I believe his name was, was incredibly patient.  He walked us through was great, good, or don't go there items on the menu.  You could tell he really cared about his work and wanted us to have a better than average experience.  He was like this with all his tables, not just us.

We started with the artichoke appetizer, amazing!  The candied lemon really brought everything tougher.  We enjoyed a stellar bottle of Cabernet from Napa called Newton; well balanced, not too fruity and it went amazing with the steak I had.  My date had the ribs, delightful.  They were a great balance of salty, sweet and spicy; again going wonderfully with the wine.  For desert we had a cross between bread pudding and apple pie, warm with cinnamon and carmel and a side of vanilla ice cream.  My mouth is watering just typing about it.  

In all, this is a great relaxed date spot or a fun place to meet friends and sit in the sun enjoying good food and drinks.  I will definitely be eating here again soon!"}
{"text":"After going to a concert at The Joint, I checked Yelp for a decent restaurant closeby and found Culinary Dropout. Based on Yelp reviews, I had some high hopes for this place. Boy was I disappointed! 

First of all, the meats/cheese board is ridiculously overpriced. We ordered a few different types of  cheese and meat ($7 each, $5 each) and the portions were incredibly tiny. I asked the waiter \"Is this it?\" and come to find out, each portion is only 1.5 oz. You gotta be kidding me !! $5 or $7 dollars for 1.5 oz of meat or cheese is just ridiculous. I get that this is Vegas, but the meat/cheese wasn't special at all.

Second, the sandwich (Chicken Club) was good, but nothing to write home about. $14 dollars is fairly comparable to what I would pay at home, so I have no complaints about price on that.

The best thing was the pretzel and cheese dip. I would come back just for that dip plus a drink.

As far as beer list, 20oz Ninkasi tricerahops was $10! WHAAAA? Most cocktails priced at $12, so go for a cocktail if you come here.

Also, who decided that it was a good idea to skip adding a bathroom and use the preexisting bathroom  on the casino floor?"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night, and it's a great place to grab a drink and some excellent appetizers. The crowd was very trendy and the inside is upscale. 

It's located near the Scottsdale Waterfront, and the downside of the location is the parking. We ended up parking at the parking garage that is located across from Olive and Ivy. It was free, and only a short walk. 

We had a bit of a wait, and Friday nights tend to have louder and busier, for it was a nice place to start out for the evening."}
{"text":"My husband and I were on a quest to find a restaurant in Vegas that has a good fried chicken not served in cardboard or on a tray. Luckily, we came across this place. It's inside the Hard Rock Casino. For a Saturday night, the place wasn't that busy. Matt our server was friendly and wore a kilt! :) 

Matt got our order in without delay. Great since the fried chicken is made to order but worth the wait. When the plate arrived, the chicken was juicy and like homemade. The mashed potatoes were excellent. A bigger portion would've really cost me my diet 'cheat day'.  My husband ordered the Bistro Steak.  Very good and perfectly medium. Cooked through nicely, not over done. 

Definitely want to come back again. Maybe a bit earlier to hear that he live music. Unfortunately by the time we were seated at 10:30, the musicians were packing up."}
{"text":"It's always nice to hear back from a manager after having a lousy experience and because Alyssa too the time to show her concern and apology, we decided to give it another shot and we were so happy we did!  Not only was the service excellent, so was the food.  The fried chicken was delicious as was a the chopped salad, not to mention the outstanding pretzel and fondue.  It was all we had hoped for the first time--so glad we returned.  Thanks so much Alyssa and crew!"}
{"text":"What can I say...Great Place...Great staff, fun atmosphere. Looks out to the pool area at The Hard Rock Hotel. Good drinks, nice pours and the Pretzels are Amazing. I have been her several times now and it's been great each time."}
{"text":"A hip and fun spot for the younger crowd at the Hard Rock Hotel. The patio area is near the pool and is very loud due to the outside music. The food is pretty good but not stellar. Some unique items. Short wine list. Too loud for an intimate dinner, but good for a larger group."}
{"text":"I thought this place was fantastic! Came in on Labor Day and had the 25% off everything coupon. The valet parking was a very nice touch, We were greeted by 3 very friendly hosts at the door and were seated right away. Decided on inside, but will go out on the patio next time. Isabella was our server and she was great. Very attentive and very patient as we had an older gentleman in our group of 4. Wife and I first split the house salad with ginger dressing. It was fresh and the dressing livened up the salad superbly. We then split the Summer Corn Cannelloni. This dish is beyond belief. While the noodle was more like a traditional ravioli, the stuffing of corn, mascarpone cheese and a touch of truffle oil made this memorable. Our friends had the fish and chips and they enjoyed every bite. 

This is another FRC restaurant and Sam Fox has another winner. Since we moved to the Valley in February, we've visited several of the FRC places and have loved each one of them. Please come to the West Valley ASAP, please. I think my wife and I will make our next visit to The Yard a progressive and visit all 3 restaurants, taking in the best of each. Looking forward to doing that very soon."}
{"text":"Service, great. Drinks, fantastic. Food... Could have been better. Waiter knew tricks and the menu. I will return because the atmosphere is good, drinks are great but the food was bland and not enough to choose from. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I took a friend here for her bday and boy was that the ticket. She loved the furniture, deco and couldn't have been more impressed with the food / service. 
This won't be my last time here I'll tell ya that. Great job CD."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, the Korean style brussels sprouts are to die for must try and you have to come in during dayshift and meet Matt what a fabulous individual!!"}
{"text":"We've been once before and couldn't wait to get back. Their Social Hour is incredibly priced with wonderfully prepared treats. Think fresh seared ahi, cheese fondue, pork rinds, spiced nuts, olives, watermelon salad, mac & cheese, and more. The beverages are perfection, and the service cannot be beat. Love it."}
{"text":"Love the décor and ambiance of Culinary Dropout! They offer both indoor and outdoor seating- both great choices, I usually like to try and sit inside right next to the outside line- gives the best of both worlds! The service has always been great, and I really enjoy the food! 

You have to try the soft pretzels with provolone fondue- sooooooooooooooooo yummy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Culinary Dropout after visiting the nearby mall. The vibe on a Saturday night was just what we were looking for - good music, nice variety of appetizers, bar area that wraps around the inside and outside, and good drinks. We weren't too hungry so ordered the pretzel bite with our drinks which hit the spot. If you're looking for a sit-down meal I'd recommend making a reservation prior to coming."}
{"text":"The fondue pretzels are absolutely amazing. The meatloaf was great (and I don't like meatloaf).
And the burgers are on point! I recommend any of he food on this menu. Not sure im a fan of a Moscow mule without a copper mug tho"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about as I was not very impressed.  This place is loud and dark with lots of TV's throughout the restaurant.  We wanted a nice relaxing dinner but the noise made it hard to talk.  The food was good, but I've never seen a restaurant charge you $3 for 4 slices of bread, really?  Seems minor league to me.  My father had the trout which was a good sized fish.  I had the meatloaf which was tasty but the sauce was a simple ketchup base.  This place gets the tourists but I know a lot better places with quality food.  I won't becoming back."}
{"text":"Haven't ever had a good experience here... This location is terrible! The service is pretty terrible... always! The location is \"on a wait\" even though there are available tables.  We were told we could be seated right away, then had to wait... And wait... And we were the only ones waiting! The food is good, but I would personally never deal with this place again! Truly miserable!

The only reason I gave it two stars was because they realized they screwed up and gave us free drinks and appetizers... And we finally just sat at the bar (after 30-45 minutes)... The bartender was really really good!"}
{"text":"How did I miss this place so long?  If I still lived in Tempe I don't think I would go anywhere else. There is more than ample space with areas for different needs (play area with ping pong and corn hole, chill area with couches,  and a quieter old folks area). As always the pretzel bites are an absolute must.
Overall a must visit and not just if you are in the area. This is a destination joint similar to the monastery minus the bbq."}
{"text":"Pretzels are always delicious for my wife. Gluten free options are okay but the salmon was really good. Nice and light but still filling. Outdoor seating was perfect on a nice day although the street noise was a little annoying."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a prominent location right across from Fashion Square and the decor is very stylish.  We stopped in with just 10 minutes to go before happy hour was over. There were a decent amount of people at the bar and about half of the tables were filled. The tables and chairs are cool and allow for some privacy in a pretty open place.  The server took our order just before happy hour ended so we got the HH prices.  The happy hour menu includes 13 items so you really can make a meal out of it if you want and they don't rip you off with mini portion sizes like some restaurants do. Like most others we could not refuse the pretzels and cheese.  Impressive presentation and very tasty. Needless to say I ate too many! We also had the pork nachos- thick chips and very tasty toppings. Drinks were a little delayed but the food was brought out unbelievably quickly. There were one or two people-other than the waiter- taking food and drinks to the tables and this really seemed to help their service. After all of the HH appys we were not very hungry so two of us shared the meatloaf and the other two had \"yesterdays soup\" which was chicken tortilla. Here is where I took off a star.  It was very salty! I could not finish mine. They had live entertainment starting just as were were leaving so I am sure it gets even livelier."}
{"text":"Everything was going good at first.... came here for happy hour with a group of 5. Happy hour is from 3-6 and they have a pretty good selection! Our group decided to get the pretzels with cheese considering its national pretzel day... but with a larger group we didn't know if more people ordered more than one pretzels. So the food runner brought out two, okay seems normal. Halfway through us eating our pretzels the foreign bartender comes up to us and takes our other pretzels that we have already been eating out of, AND DIPPING OUR PRETZELS in the cheese. He said that we only ordered one pretzel. Okay, so that's fine if we ordered one pretzel....... but he gave our already eaten pretzels and cheese to another guest!!! I've worked in the food industry my whole time in Vegas and that is absolutely disgusting. I understand if we got two food orders and he took it away and threw it away, but he gave our already eaten food to another guest that had no idea it's already been touched. I'm absolutely flabbergasted and it scares me because that can happen to anyone that isn't paying attention. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Definitely fits into the new Tempe vibe. It's got a great atmosphere where sports fans, hipsters and families all feel welcome and right at home. The wait staff was incredible and my glass was never empty. We started the night with the pretzel and cheese fondue. The pretzels were the star of the dish. My girlfriend and I had the pork belly and shrimp ramen. This was my first ramen dish and it was incredible. The pork belly gave the dish a wonderful smoky flavor and the  cilantro and bean sprouts added a real freshness and nice texture. I would recommend this dish to everyone. For dessert we sampled several dishes. They were all delicious, but the real standout was the caramel custard topped with caramel popcorn. I could get addicted to this stuff. I will never come here and not order this. I don't remember the name but I call it caramel crack!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here - but as a prospect - I want I want I want!

Great looking place, and beautiful seating on a covered patio.  Nice menu, bar, comfort-style food, and looks like a good place for drinks and meeting friends.

I will return, Culinary Dropout, so save a seat for me.  It will be mine.  Oh yes, it will be mine!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. I don't see what the big hee-haw is about...."}
{"text":"This place is totally fun and hip! I was surprised that the waitstaff is dressed like they shop at Urban Outfitters, but it does add to the chill vibe here. My friends and I came for lunch it was perfect. There was live music and the food was pretty delicious! We shared the pretzel balls with cheese fondue as an appetizer and I got the kale salad for my main. The salad is so yummy and it is filled with all kinds of goodies - like crunchy nut bits and goat cheese and avocado. Yum!"}
{"text":"So we wanted to try this as it was part of Restaurant Week here in AZ and after reading the reviews we were pretty excited.  Made our reservation for Sunday at 5:00 and when we arrived it was pretty full. We were seated right away and our server was great ,very accommodating.  It has a good feel and I think the Ping Pong table and other entertainment look like lots of fun. So we order our food and it comes out in a timely matter but this is where Culinary Dropout missed the mark, the food was lackluster and just so so.  My younger daughter had the fish and chips, my other daughter had the kale salad with salmon and I had the steak tacos, now out of all these (and I tasted everything) you would expect something to be exceptional but the only thing that I would say was really good was the steak taco meat.  It came out to almost 80.00 for the three of us and I left a good tip, but I will definitely not be returning here for the food.  We really wanted to like it but it just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Excellent service, and fantastic food selection. Their prosciutto is LEGIT! Great place to come after shopping, for a business lunch, or just to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. 

What I like - service is excellent. Ask to be in Jay's section! 
The overall vibe, music, ping pong, corn-hole, TV screens, seating areas & beer selection. An excellent place to hang with friends!
Things that could improve - very spendy for the qualify of food, if you sit in the outdoor area this time of the year prepare for your food to arrive a little cold, if going for a football game (they have great TV screens) the visibility on the outdoor screens is a little off in each of the areas."}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday breakfast. Great service from hostess and waiter, great patio looking out to pool. Food was just so so unfortunately. 

Had the breakfast burrito and the French toast. 

Breakfast burrito was decent sized and came with breakfast potatoes. Burrito itself reminded me of the microwave breakfast burritos you get in gas stations. Edible, does the job but not good. Potatoes were good. 

French toast was good if not too sweet. Captain crunch coating added a good texture, served with raspberries. Good item if you are ok with the sweetness. 

Pros: service and ambiance 
Cons: breakfast food (maybe their lunch and dinner is better)"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place.  Great vibe. Great food.   Great drinks.  Great service.   Had the deviled eggs and turkey pastrami.   Wonderful."}
{"text":"4 stars for food, 3 for the fact it took 30 min to get it even though this massive place wasn't that busy.

Turkey pastrami was delish. 

I would definitely come back.


Looks like a fun place to hang out and throw a few bags and beers back!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. This place is delish. 
First of all, walking in. The atmosphere is awesome. Dark with a young, hip feeling. The staff has no uniforms, which is cool. Everyone has their own style. The decor is also cool. The chairs and plates are all mismatched but go together. Red, black and white plates are stacked by the kitchen. 

Now- the food. 
We got the pretzels and cheese fondue. Let me just say: to DIE for. Seriously. I could probably just eat that as a meal. Pretzels are big and soft nuggets with just enough salt. The cheese fondue is perfecttttt. 
I got a crispy shrimp Caesar salad. Pretty good, but then again, I've never had any sort of Caesar salad I didn't like.
My boyfriend got the prime rib sandwich I think it was? Some sort of steak and cheese. The bread was nice and soft, not all hard and crusty like most rolls I've had/seen. Meat was tender and the cheese was good. I had one fry, wasn't impressed. 

All in all, I loved it all. The service was good. Atmosphere was nice. Good was good. I'll definitely be back, even if only for the pretzels and cheese."}
{"text":"I read the yelp reviews on Culinary Dropout and based on the reviews I gave this place a shot. I thought it was just alright. I got the fried chicken dish and it wasn't bad my any means but it wasn't amazing either. The sides were pretty bland (mashed potatoes and green beans). The fried chicken itself was better than the sides, but again nothing to write home about. Since I went on a Thursday night around 6 (early dinner for Vegas) the restaurant was pretty empty and the service was average (after the order was placed and the food came out and we were done eating it took awhile to round up the bill). Probably wouldn't come back since there are soooooooo many other places I want to try in Las Vegas and overall it is mediocre at best in my opinion. Also they don't have a bathroom in the restaurant so if you need to relieve yourself you have to walk out of the restaurant and through the casino to find the bathroom!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice now and am in love with the meatloaf and mashed potatoes! I enjoy a good meatloaf and really loved this one. It has mashed potatoes, meatloaf with a ketchup-type sauce and a brown gravy plus green beans on top. My two companions had other choices, sorry that I can't remember what, but enjoyed them too. Had great service both times and I like the casual atmosphere. The only recommendation: my husband almost rejected going there because they had a huge empty lot only for valet, but on a Sunday night after 8 pm, that seemed unnecessary and spaces should have been opened up. We finally found street parking and he agreed to go."}
{"text":"Amendment...Kyle, the owner, commented that he'll talk to the DJ and manager about the noise level and get it right.  So nice to find an establishment that takes customer feedback to heart.  I hope we can return soon....

Food was amazing, but we couldn't hear each other talking.  We went on a Sunday at 1pm...why is there a DJ with crazy loud music on a Sunday afternoon?  We asked our waiter if there was a place where it would be easier to talk, but he didn't think so.  He said there is a DJ there on Sundays starting at 12:30, so if we wanted to come when it was quieter, we could come between 11am and 12:30.

Back to the food...the cheesesteak is crazy good!  Melt-in-your mouth, just the right amount of cheese, yummy au jus...best I've had anywhere.  Others in our party got the kale & sweet potato salad, ahi tuna salad, pub burger, and kids' meals with chicken fingers and mac and cheese.  Everyone said hands down that the food was incredible.  We all agreed, though, that we won't come back unless the loud music is toned down.  

It's a fun place with great games to play and a wonderful vibe...I really think it could be just as hip if the music was tamed.  I hope it does get turned down, because I'm going to be craving that cheesesteak!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Just a relaxing vibe. Have some great food and unwind on play ping pong or cornhole. 

Ordered the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy with a biscuit. It was delicious!!!!Best Mashed Potatoes and gravy ever!!!! Don't tell my wife I said that. Chicken was too die for so juicy and crunchy!!!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute place. I met the girls here on a Saturday to catch up over drinks! I had the wings and pomegranate cider. Both were great. The service was fair. I'd love to come back With a group to enjoy the space. I really loved their private dining areas as well. Great space and concept."}
{"text":"I've never been one to fall in love easily. Until now. Culinary Dropout was love at first bite. 

Walking in, the decor of this place caused instant infatuation. I want to steal their purple wall and get a mini version of those wonderful green crystal chandeliers for my bedroom. Their booths are so comfy and the lighting was just right. When it cools down I definitely plan on spending some time having cocktails on their beautiful patio. 

Our server, Tori was adorable and fantastic. Not only was she incredibly perky and attentive, she knew the menu like the back of her hand. And the way she described all of the items made me want to order one of everything. Also, she encouraged us to take our time. We started with an app, hung out and talked, then ordered an entree, hung out and marinated on that, and then ended with dessert. We were there for quite some time and never felt rushed or abandoned. Tori made our dining experience more than stellar. 

Now to the important part. The A.maz.ing. food. 

First out, the soft pretzels with provolone fondue. Oh em gee. I LOVE pretzels and cheese but I will never be satisfied again unless I'm having it at Culinary Dropout. The pretzels have just the right amount of sea salt (not too much) and are so fantastically soft. The fondue was the perfect temperature and they have a little candle flame to keep it the right consistency so you can take your time eating. Although those pretzels disappeared really fast. 

Our entree, the sweet corn cannelloni. Thanks to Tori warning me this is seasonal and will change to butternut squash I was all over it. My friend and I split this and the serving size was still plentiful. I want to find whomever came up with the idea of putting mashed corn inside the cannelloni pasta and kiss them on the lips. The butter sauce was so flavorful but not too heavy and complimented the corn flavor instead of distracting from it. 

Dessert. Words cannot describe. I have lived in a world where I believed the best dessert in existence was creme brulee with berries until last night. The salted caramel custard made me want to utter inappropriate noises of delight. Topped with their caramel popcorn and chilled at just the right temperature, my friend and I indulged in silence as our taste buds rejoiced. If I wasn't classy I would have licked the cup. 

So, Culinary Dropout, I am in love. All I want to know is when we will meet again??? I'll be longing for you until that day."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by here after work for a bite to eat.  We were seated promptly, but it took some time for a server to get to us.  After waiting about 10 minutes someone apologized for the wait (without us even mentioning anything about the wait) and took our order.  Less than five minutes later a manager came up to our table and profusely apologized for the wait and offered to comp several of our items. We ordered several appetizers for our dinner and they comped half of what we ordered! We never had to complain or say anything, but they were proactive about seeing a blip in service and made sure they didn't lose a customer.  That's what I call service! The food was on par with other similar restaurants with a large happy hour crowd...it wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst (thus the 4 stars)."}
{"text":"This place made me as happy as that old lady in the Scooter Store commercials. You know the one, who started spinning around in circles when her wheelchair is replaced with the scooter? Yeah, that happy!

A small group of us went here for brunch/lunch on Saturday. Having been to the Scottsdale location before, I had an idea of what was on the menu. However, what puts this Culinary Dropout stand out is an awesome patio. We started with the crusty bread and olive oil (with a balsamic vinegar syrup) and the 12-hour roasted tomatoes. Both we excellent, and super inexpensive. We also had their bacon bloody mary (of course) which was divine (of course). My meal was the biscuits and gravy with two sunny-side-up eggs and home fries. The gravy was so good, I could have sucked it up through a straw. So good! We all agreed this would be a perfect spot for a first date. If any of us were actually going out on dates.

We're planning on riding our bikes back here soon. As an added bonus, an oyster bar is slated to open in the complex within the next month. We peaked in the windows, and it looks like another great spot for a first date (with the added benefit of eating oysters, so I might have a chance to get some!!)"}
{"text":"I gave this place a bad grade because my burrata was hard which is odd . the rest of the food was good service was ok . But looking at the bartenders from my seat the guys looked dress for the part . the girls looked to causal one with long dark straight hair touched her hair like 8 times with out washing her hands and ate something with out washing her hands again their was like ten health code violations . so i just dont like places that arent watching their staff because they atre the people taking care of us"}
{"text":"Food was so so, service horrendous, it took over an hour and a half to get our food. Our waitress kept forgetting my boyfriend's orders. And no one apologized for how long our meal took to arrive. The restaurant was not busy. Great Bloody Mary however. Overall I will not be back again."}
{"text":"Pretzels & Fondue are great. Drinks are creative (but overpriced and small). Food is decent. Nothing to write home about but not bad.  Fun atmosphere. I mostly go for the pretzels and fondue. Reasonably priced.  There have been multiple times I've been appalled by the outfits of the waitresses. Too much skin showing, beyond inappropriate, on the verge of a strip club.  Also, without any waiter uniform, you can't tell waiters from guests.  They need a dress code. Also the music is much to loud when they have live bands. Don't go on a Friday night if you'd like to have conversation."}
{"text":"Okay Culinary Dropout round 2.  We hit the one at The Yard a couple weeks ago and last week for lunch I brought my kids here.  Yep, I'm one of the few people who think it's important to train our next generation in appreciating food, atmosphere and service.  And how to behave in restaurants.  And to let you know my kids are both double digits.
So it was lunch, on a Wednesday.  Things were pretty slow, as I was hoping I really don't want to be hanging out in a bar with my kids.  BUT the food was so good the last time I had to come back.  
Service was not as amazing as it was at the yard, I feel that Jeff was a gem in the culinary world.  It was good, Ashlinn didn't warm up to us until half way through our meal. She was surprised by my children food selection and their conduct.

Our meal!  Yes the most important part of the review...  My son ordered the chicken club sandwich.  He devoured every bit and said it was even better than our favorite place back in Wilmington, Nc.  My daughter has now deemed their muscles the best EVER.  I concur now that I've had them twice, in 2 locations... and the bread. YUM! They finally sold me a loaf as it was mid week (YAY! and it turned into THE best french toast I've EVER made, topped with strawberries and my amazing 'little bit of heaven' vanilla sauce.
I had the Shrimp Caesar again... there is something either the breading on the shrimp or the dressing it like crack... YUM.

Culinary Dropout has quickly become my favorite place to grab some grub.  It's amazing food and atmosphere, I love how every thing is so casual.  If I were 20 years younger I do anything to work here.  I now need to check out the Scottsdale location.

Thank you Culinary Dropout!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is exceptional!!! Since moving back to the area I've driven by a few times and was always intrigued by what was behind those walls. Well let me tell you heaven my friend, heaven is behind those walls.  
From the get go at valet, where my door was opened for me (I was the passenger) and greeted with a smile.  I knew this was going to be a good time.  
Seated quite quickly outside, 'cuz it's spring in Phoenix and if you are not sitting outside at every opportunity you are crazy!  The Yard is so fun and such a relaxing atmosphere.  But it was our server Jeff that truly made this an incredible experience.  This kid, was fun, attentive and knowledgable. I normally have to ask my waiters what their top three favorite items are on the menu.  But NOT so with Jeff.  He quickly have us a tour of all the menus pointing out his favorite in every section.  You could tell this boy knew his stuff and enjoyed it.  
We started with cocktails and the black mussels... OH MY!!! DE-lish!!! I try to stay away from starches but this broth made me break down and eat a half of the thick cut amazingly baked bread (on site! everything is made ON SITE)
I had another artisan cocktail and the Shrimp Ceasar Salad... oh my!  I have no idea what they put on the shrimp or in the dressing but, I'll be back for more of that!
My husband had the Italian Grinder (highly recommended by Jeff) not a thing was left on his plate. We asked Jeff a ton of questions, which he knew the answer to most and if he didn't he went and asked.  
Had to order the Salted Caramel Custard for dessert because Salted! AND Caramel!!! Hellooo!  I shouldn't have eaten as much as I did but OH my tastebuds were in their happy place!  
Kyle the manager came over and check on us... great guy.  You can tell the people who work here, really love their job.  
Needless to say we left stuffed as if it were Thanksgiving.
We will surely be back!!  
Thanks Jeff!!!"}
{"text":"Finally after the 3 years I've lived in Phoenix I decided to try culinary dropout! I was not disappointed is all I have to say! And the place is huge! The menu was interesting yet simple, I had a mule which I absolutely loved! It was called pistol something I don't know I forget but it had bourbon and was top with cab! Never had a mile with red wine but I loved it! For an appetizer we had the pretzels and fondue, which was good however our fondue was not warm at all! For our entrees I had the trout which was absolutely delicious! Flavors were on point, &cooked perfect! I forget what kind of nuts were on it which kind of scared me because I'm not a huge fan, but it actually meshed well with the dish! My friend had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, he's a very picky eater and was actually quite impressed with his dinner! We totally would of got dessert but we were stuffed! Our server also was quite lovely, don't know his name but he had a pony tail haha. He was very attentive when he wasn't busy, and was very helpful with the menu.! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The patio is the perfect setup to grab a few cocktails and watch people stumble out of Rehab. People watching in Vegas at it's finest. Perfect for groups - big, open space, well lit, huge bar and outside games. It's built for socializing. There's a bit of noise from the pool but this isn't the place to go for a quiet meal. 

Food, drink and service were all excellent! Our waitress, Lorna, has a great attitude and enjoys coming to work. It showed with her service. We ordered all the right things thanks to her. Crispy, close to U.K. style fish and chips, AMAZING kale, caesar salad (and I don't even like kale), tasty, fresh beets and our double El Matador drinks hit the spot. The drink menu has something for everyone. I loved the whole concept of this restaurant. I felt welcome and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Heed the name! We went early @ 4:30 last Saturday afternoon. Even though there was plenty of available seating, we were told there would be over an hour wait for a table. So, we grabbed 2 stools at a dirty high top near the bar. Mind you, more than half the restaurant was empty. I had read rave reviews about their pretzel bites. When I looked around, I saw empty tables that had baskets full of pretzel bites including the high top we occupied. I took that as bad sign #2. When the server finally showed up to greet us, he offered to clean our table in 'just a minute' that turned out to be 10. As soon as he brought the menus, we ordered the Brussel sprouts. They came to the table before he did, again. After tasting them, we decided to cut our losses and leave. Anyone can deep fry a Brussel sprout and douse Crystal hot sauce on them. Come on! Not only are they culinary dropouts, they must hire Management/service dropouts, as well."}
{"text":"First timer.. good food and service and a real cool spot. Interesting concept, well done"}
{"text":"Friday night, four of us went to the pre-opening event at Culinary Dropout benefiting Local First Arizona. The place has a wonderful upscale, casual feel were you would be as comfortable in a business suit or shorts and flip flips.

Prices were what I expect from the Fox Restaurant Concepts. The most expensive entree on the menu was the Korean Style Ribeye Cap. I had the Shaved Prime Rib Dip. It was a solid, tasty sandwich, but I felt it was a bit pricey at $17.

Their posted happy hours are Monday to Friday 3pm to 6pm. Several of their sandwiches and appetizers are $3 or $4 their regular prices. Mug beers are $3 and well drinks are $4. 

I will be back, likely riding my bike over with friends for a few $1.95 brown bag mystery beers and a few games out in \"The Yard\""}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town now! There pretzels are a total must. We went there for a happy hour yesterday and were pleasantly surprised. Not only are the dishes delicious, but they also looks so sophisticated. It's a perfect place for the first date if you don't want to spend a fortune but still impress your date. The chef chose 3 different appetizers for us (cold cuts, cheeses, olives, asparagus nuts ecc), it was a good portion!!! We got also salmon crostini. Delicious. Our server was very fast and super friendly. The place has also a very affordable oyster bar. The only small complain I have is that they don't have wine for a happy hour. Everything else is perfect. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We came here for our first Las Vegas Restaurants Week experience and it did not disappoint! We had the pretzel bites with fondue cheese, cheddar cracklins, crispy shrimp ceaser, a huge burger, and best of all MY CHILDREN LOVED THE MEATLOAF MEAL!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bad food, terrible service. I would never go there again.
Might be ok for ASU students to go there and have an expensive beer but don't eat there.
Don't order their sliders as there is no meet all white bread."}
{"text":"Brought friends and drove an hour to visit-the food was really very good but it was so loud nobody could hear each other. We went outside-still to loud to talk. We had sore throats from yelling to eachother. Turn it down guys!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great, fun environment, live music on the weekends. I like that there's usually a mix of old and young people, singles and families. Great place to bring people visiting from out of town. 

I don't love meatloaf but theirs is so good! Love the kale salad too, which is very generous. 

One of our favorite spots! It does get busy during games so go early."}
{"text":"First time at this location.  It's a big place and it was packed on a Monday. The service was good, the food was good. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place gets HIGH marks in my book!! I have been twice and I really don't know when I would stop.  I've had a few things on the menu (
soft pretzels & provolone Fondue, 
Chicken Curry, 
36 Hour pork rib, 
Butternut squash Cannelloni, and Bistro Steak).  All were extremely delicious and fantastic!!  We shared plates and the chef split the portions up for us. WOW!! As far as drinks go, my fave has to be the Acai Mojito.  It's one of those drinks that taste so good and before you know you are having number 3 and BOOM your drunk. LOL! 

The salty caramel desert is DIVINE!! Creamy custard goodness!!

I highly RECOMMEND this place! The decor is unique, mismatch furniture  and extravagant chandeliers. GENIUS!"}
{"text":"Matt is the best ever! We came in and the service was amazing. We came for the bloody Mary's and stayed for the bartender. Drinks were amazing so was the service."}
{"text":"I live near the downtown location, but I make it a point to come to this location whenever dining out. The service is incredible - ask for Emily N.- she is the best server ever! She recommended the wild blue blueberry beer, its my new favorite beer! This place is a must check out!"}
{"text":"We waited for 45 minutes, and during that time I noticed that a) I was the only under-50 rocking glasses and b) my chest-zone was neither big nor uncovered enough to blend with the Friday night crowd and c) too many people were ordering salads. Oh, Scottsdale.

I protested by drinkin' a boozy bourbon mix drink and eating my weight in pretzel (both in fondue and sandwich-bun form).  

And, despite my geriatric eyewear and comparably lacking lady lumps, one of the sweetie boys working there gave us a custardy caramely dessert with popcorn on top, which my friend generous pretended to share when, in actuality, she watched me ninja my spoon through more than 70% of it.

Good thing he couldn't see my post-pretzel food baby. I doubt he would have bothered being charming at all."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday today. The food was great.  Portion sizes large enough to share . The staff was very friendly. The manager came out to make sure we were enjoying our meal and the chief did a great job on quality and appearance. I will go back for sure"}
{"text":"Solid Fox Concept restaurant.  The wait staff was fast and nice, and the food was delicious!  If I'm in the area again I will go back.  Plenty of parking and the atmosphere was fun and different.  I went there for lunch and it seemed crowded but not packed.  Lots of room though and should be able to handle large groups.  Despite the open layout, I had no trouble hearing anyone in my party."}
{"text":"The food was decent enough but this is 4 stars due to the amazing staff who went above and beyond with their level of service, sense of humor, and attentiveness.  I'd definitely head back the next time I stay at the Hard Rock.  Easy enough location if you're staying there and a solid option."}
{"text":"I'm looking for the 6th star on this one!!

What a place, just bummed that it's 2,200 miles from home and would be a long drive for dinner. 

The place itself is amazing. Had to be 200 people here. It's huge. One area has couches around fire pits. Corn hole, ping pong, table shuffleboard. I mean how cool is that. 

The food was fantastic. Kale salad, cornbread, ribs...get em. Just sayin'.

The staff was as friendly a group as I've ever seen. All of them were friendly and always there with speedy service and a smile. 

They had about 12 beers on tap, great choices to. When you have Deschutes, you're ok in my book. 

And the prices. Holy crap. I thought they forgot to add a few things.  

You need to go here. Trust me."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is beautiful. I went on a day where the weather was like low 80s or high 70s, so I got to sit and dine outside. It made the experience joyful. 
For atmosphere, I'd give this place a 4.5/5.

The food menu was very limited. I took a while deciding what I want to get because there were not much appetizing choices for me. There are mostly burgers, salads, sandwiches and soup. Well I guess since it is an American restaurant. There are quite a few drink choices though. For the menu, I'd give it a 3/5.

The food I got was a smoked salmon with tomatoes, bread and egg. The salmon was good, I ate it together with the tomatoes and bread. The dish may seem a bit strange to some people, but everything on the dish is served cold or cool. Somewhere between those two. It's just not served hot. For drinks, I got the strawberry mojito. I'd give the food a 4/5."}
{"text":"Wow! 

Went here for lunch as fellow helpers ha written that they had a mean Prime roastbeef sandwich also called the French dip by some. And it was certainly mouthdripping amazing! Tons of thinly sliced juicy roastbeef on a slightly grilled loaf with mayo and a creamy cheese. When dipped in the secret concoction called jus it was like an mouthgasm!!! It was extremely good that i even forgot about the hefty 17 $ pricetag.  We also chared grilled cheese sliders with bacon that tasted really good as well. The cheese wich ever one they use was packed with cheesy deliciousness and the salty bacon complimented it perfectly. At 10 $ these little babys where a bargain. 

Tried one of the local beers and i think it was called Scottsdale Blonde. Crisp and refreshing in the desert heat and a hit with the food. 

The place has a great ambiance and interior decor and the place is located just a short walk from Fashion Square.  Our waitress was fast, funny and did great.  

Would come back for more the next time im in town!"}
{"text":"Four and a half stars, but only because I've been once and I wasn't COMPLETELY sold.  Don't get me wrong though, because Culinary Dropout is fantastic!  We chose a relatively odd time of day to grab some lunch, so it was fairly empty when we were seated.  Our waitress was nice enough, but a little stand-offish.  She did her job right, so that's all I really care about.  After I decided what I wanted I gazed about the restaurant, admiring the decor while our waitress made her way back.

We ordered the pretzel bread with cheese fondue to start and I got the grilled cheese sliders.  The pretzel bread was DELICIOUS, even without the cheese dip.  The cheese dip just threw the whole dish over the top amazing.  I really loved this stuff, but I had to stop eating it so I could actually make room for the grilled cheese.  This app is more expensive than the rest, but there is easily enough to feed 4 people.  My grilled cheese sliders were wonderful.  They were served on the adorable little mini slices that look like they were made for fairies, and I just loved that.  So dainty!  The cheese inside was ooey, gooey, and melty.  Just perfect.  Plus, there was bacon, so how can you go wrong.  I think fries came with it, but I can't remember.

I will definitely make my way back here at some point.  I hope Mr. Fox decides to bring one closer to Downtown Phoenix because that would be awesome!  In an area where everything feels so contrived and pretentious, Culinary Dropout was a welcome haven to relax and be yourself."}
{"text":"Food is good..on the weekends its always a long wait and the musicians are def not of my taste. Plus its super loud when they do have musicians. But i would definitely get the pretzel fondue its pretty awesome."}
{"text":"This place is the anchor restaurant for the Yard, another solid Sam Fox Restaurant. 

Went there on a Thursday night and was packed with the young business crowd but still was seated within 5 minutes.

Ordered the Pretzel Fondue,  Famous Fried Chicken and Kurobuta Pork Ribs which were all amazing.

The Pretzel Fondue was fun and very good but did not want to eat too much since the entrée was not out yet. The fondue would be good for up to 4 - 6 people. Gotta try this!
The Famous Fried Chicken was well prepared and glazed with honey to torture you with finger licking goodness. Also the Kurobuta Pork Ribs were very tender and the sauce was very unique in a good way. Was very happy with our selections. Was too full to try any dessert. 

2nd time at the Yard and learned to valet the car with limited parking in the area.  Last time going to Little Cleo's we parked in the neighborhood at night and did not see the no parking sign"}
{"text":"Pretty much agree with the other reviews but have to say that the super long wait for a table and ridiculously loud atmosphere (although it is really kinda cool and trendy) is worth it for the turkey pastrami sandwich. Forget everything else on the menu and get this sandwich. Just do it. It's the best sandwich I've ever had and I've had some amazing sandwiches and I'm super picky, too!! The cole slaw is amazing. The turkey is smokey and lean. The pretzel bun is to die for. SO good. We also always get the cheese plate. We're from Wisconsin. We know good cheese. This place has a great cheese plate. I also tried the grilled cheese sliders but seriously, nothing else is as good as the turkey. Sat next to a guy who almost had an orgasm over the monkey bread dessert but I didn't try it (should have!) Overall, it's worth the wait and noise but they really, really need to get on Open Table and start taking reservations. Would help a lot. Also need some waiting areas and to cut back on the volume of the music or add some acoustic elements so you're not deaf when you leave. Wouldn't mind some better cocktails, too. I've had two and neither of them were very good. I'll go for wine next time. Will still go back for the food but hope to see some improvement on the flow of the restaurant, overall. I'll continue to try to go on weeknights and late at night so I can get in without standing outside for an hour."}
{"text":"Walked down from my hotel to this Fashion Square area restaurant. As always, on that quest to find interesting places to eat when traveling.

I would say that the Culinary Dropout was both interesting and had pretty good food to boot. The place has a young feel to it and the servers and bartenders could just be the most attractive (and I'm talkin' men and women here folks) collection I've ever seen working in one restaurant. 

I grabbed a seat at the bar ordered a drink and decided on a Caesar Salad to start followed by Rainbow Trout for dinner. The salad came in a chilled bowl, had both romaine and kale in it and a more lemony than garlicky dressing that had a nice tart bite to it. The addition of kale was good and allowed me to text home and tell my wife I was eating a superfood for dinner to try and score some health points! 

The trout came in a hurry, too much of one really, and was a large double filet with crisp skin, toasted almonds, green beans and some carmelized onions. It was moist and tasty though it was somewhat unevenly salted. The green beans on it were cooked just right and added a great crunch. 

Beyond the pacing problems with the salad and entree coming out on top of each other, this was a nice meal and I would not hesitate to try it again."}
{"text":"The bartender Matt Scurry was well knowledgeable in the food and bar menu and made great recommendations. The beets, smoked salmon, and assortment of cheeses were absolutely delicious. Crafty yet affordable. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here twice when I visited other stores in the same complex. The restaurant is extremely well decorated and the service is excellence. It is very opened allowing you to enjoy the outdoor view and sun light while dining inside the restaurant. The first time we were here with friends, we tried lots of different appetizers on their menu. They were all equally delicious and we all had a great experience/good times. However, I ordered a Shrimp/pork belly ramon noodles dish on my second visit and was somewhat disappointed. It was extremely salty, mostly filled out with vegetables and had very little portion of noodles in it. Presentation is very well done, but I probably will not order it again on my next visit. 

Overall, I enjoy the beautiful and open space that this restaurant has."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and tried this place. The place has original menu items, and the portions are big! The food is awesome!  The atmosphere is positive and the service is fast. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I was there Saturday and as always I had excellent service, I brought my dog and they let me seat outside, they brought water to my dog without me asking them, the tacos were the best, ( NI am from Mexico City and trust me, I know if tacos are good or not). Everytime we go there, we have great experience, service and good food.
Thank you CD"}
{"text":"Stopped on my way from the Airport to my hotel.  I thought it intersting they only had two menu items starred as \"customer favorites\", but I guess they rotate/change the menu.  I had the Green Pork Chili, (Not starred), but it should have been.  Very delicious, served with awesome most Corn Bread.  The service was a bit slow, and not necessarily in sync.  For example, hour appetizer arrived, but we were almost done with it by the time they brought small plates (about 10 minutes later), so that was odd.  Definitely will be on my list to go to when I am back in town."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time there tonight. Food is always  great and servers help each other out when they get busy which is great to see. Security is always on point, knows when to take charge, super friendly, and especially Rob makes it a point to know the guests!!! They are great addition to your staff!!! Looking forward to joining again soon."}
{"text":"Great and lively venue on a Friday night. Loved having drink at the bar, dinner then hung out for some great live music. It is noisy, so if you are planning on an intimate situation, this probably isn't the place....but the food was great, and the atmosphere was great to kick off the weekend.  Not sure why it took me so long to make it here....I will be back for certain."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Vegas. We came for a family wedding. I resent paying too much money in Vegas for a mediocre meal and crappy service. I always avoid any chain, tourist trap restaurant. We are staying at the Hard Rock and we didn't want to hit the strip. We ended up at Culinary Dropout after looking at yelp. We sat at the open air bar. Dylin Lujan was our bartender. He is one of the best we've ever had. He answered our questions about some unique drinks they had, gave me tastes of some of their liqueurs and homemade mixers, and was very attentive, as was his barback. Prices for food and drinks are reasonable, quality is exceptional.  We had the pretzels and provolone fondue, kale salad, and monkey bread for dessert, along with 3 signature cocktails. Taste the falernum liqueur. The old fashioned was excellent, and the \"Pistols at Dawn\" is a sangria style mule. Adam the general manager came around and was super friendly. This was not your typical Vegas experience. Great place. Staff are all proud of the fine crafted food from scratch they offer, and the pride they have in their product shows.  We will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I ate at the Scottsdale location a few years ago and the food, service, drinks, ambiance and band were spectacular. The live musician was so good I wish he would tour to Texas so I could see him more! 

I removed one star because they made us wait for about 10 minutes even though we made a reservation about a month in advance."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and tried this restaurant for the first time. Our waitress Kaitlyn was amazing. She was alert to a possible allergy without us informing her. We mentioned we would split a soup and sandwich and they split it in the kitchen before the food came to the table. The food was delicious. It was fresh and the meals were creative."}
{"text":"Took a friend in on Thursday night for his bday and honestly it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had... We got sat right away but our server took forever to finally greet us, once he finally came over we ordered drinks and an appetizer. It took a ridiculous 20 mins to finally get our order... A runner brought our order so we couldn't even order food cuz our server hadn't touched our table. Finally got our food order in and it seriously took another 28 mins to get to the table...  I was done with my beer and since my server wasn't around I had to go up to the bar to buy a separate beer.
Oh And i didn't get a side because the server told me not to get the side salad cuz it \"was fucking disgusting\" so I got the tacos by themselves and omg were they bad, dry cold meat I just couldn't eat them. Our server apologized for all the wait and told us that some of the things would be compt and send us out a dessert on the house. Which I was like oh okay, I was already planning on ordering a dessert for my friend's bday. Supposedly the mg was gonna come out and talk to us, which never happened and to make it worst I got charged for everything including the \"free\" dessert they send us! I was looking for my server to say something and I couldn't find him. Being as frustrated  as i was I just paid and left. First & last time I experience culinary dropout! I've honestly had way better service at twins peak..."}
{"text":"Food amazing!  Staff was nice and sweet.  We love Dane! Great Hair!  A little slow on the draw but very accommodating to our needs. Fish and Chips are really amazing and the appetizers rocked!!!"}
{"text":"Great indoor/outdoor hangout spot with a happy hour feel to it. Met up with some friends for drinks/dinner. Not sure if it was just an unusually busy night for them but the valet line was wrapped around to say the least. So that took about 10 minutes before we could get out of the car. Tried their version of the Moscow mule and it did not disappoint. Had the turkey pastrami on pretzel bread as it was highly recommended by our waiter. Give it an 8/10."}
{"text":"Love, love this place! Very laid back environment. You can tell because even the employees don't have a dress code and they can wear whatever they want. The seating is comfortable with a view of the pool. We didn't get a chance to sit outside as it was 105 degrees. We were a group of three girls so it may seem like a lot of food but it was so good not to finish lol only a few Pretzel bites were spared. 
Food - Pretzel bites with cheese fondue: the first time around they didn't bring out enough cheese so we had to ask for another pot of cheese fondue. 
BBQ Pork belly nachos: De-li-ciousss! I just wish they would shred the pork instead of bigger chunks as its hard sharing with a group. 
Grilled cheese sliders - It only comes with three. Toasted, cheesy, warm, what more can u ask for? It also came with fries. 
Truffle potato chips- OMG. These are a must have every time! Try dipping them in the fondue cheese. Ah-mazing! 
Dessert - We had the Bourbon Black Bottom Pie & Caramel Salted Custard. Both delicious but the custard takes the lead."}
