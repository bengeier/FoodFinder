{"text":"Not sure who is running this place, but he/she is a TERRIBLE manager.

I've been here twice, and twice they gave me the wrong order.

I told the cashier about this, she proceeded to open the sandwich, and tell me that it \"was mine\".

First of all, the size was clearly smaller than what I ordered (to which she replied I had only a few toppings).
Secondly, the toppings were not even the ones I ordered (unless someone that looks exactly like me magically convinced them to put lettuce in my sandwich without me knowing).

As per the food. It's a cold pita with plastic-like chicken."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for dinner.  I found the meat and veggies fresh and tasted great both times.

First time was so fantastic that we came back the next week to share the goodness with one of our friends.  There was only one worker and he was sitting at one of the tables outside talking with a friend when we walked up.  He followed us in and while we stood at the counter ready to order, began flipping the dining room chairs onto the tables.  We asked if they were still open (after all it was 8:15).  To which he said \"yes\".  Then asked if the store was open to dine in and he said \"yes\" as he continued flipping up chairs.  If it were earlier in the night, we would have taken his hint and walked out empty handed.

The chicken in my pita was barely above room temperature and the sauce was glopped in the middle leaving both ends completely dry.  I ate about 2/3 of it and just threw the rest away to avoid the conflict.  Our friend's steak (which was tossed into the very back corner of the grill to heat up) was still cold.  He only ate about 3 bites of it and had to go back out side to try to get his money back.

The guy argued with him saying \"I made your pita last, so your meat had to be hot.\" (He also ordered last and the back corner of a griddle doesn't get hot) and \"You should have come and got me right away.\"  The guy refused to give him his money back and when we asked for the corporate office's phone number, he scribbled the phone number to the store on a napkin!

I have an emailed complaint in with the Director of Operations and will post an update once it's all settled.

Avoid eating here at all cost if the larger Latino guy is working!  He obviously doesn't care about customer service or providing a decent pita."}
{"text":"Having extreme pita for the first time after my sister offered to buy me dinner. Had the Philly steak pita and my sister had the teriyaki chicken. My first concern was while watching the guy make our food. While mixing the ingredients in the bowl he would spill some onto the table and then scoop it right back into the bowl. After finishing my sisters pita, he spilled the contents of mine onto the table as well and again scooped it back into the bowl, even though he never cleaned up his previous spill. He served 2 more customers before cleaning his work area. That was probably the biggest turn off. My pita seemed to be mostly lettuce and the few pieces of steak I got were tough and really needed seasoning. Considering the cost, I was greatly disappointed. Probably not eating here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Perfect pita's. Good for family's. Love the shakes. Clean establishment. Highly recommend. Good job!"}
{"text":"Overall great food. I highly recomend the Thai chicken or buffalo chicken pitas. Very good and healthy alternative for lunch. They cook to order and you can watch them make your food. Very tasty and healthy, but unfortunately pricey. 1 Regular Pita is about $7 not including chips or drink."}
{"text":"Tried this place on pita day. They have decent pitas and price is ok. 

Parking is free since they are in a Rio Can strip mall. There is some seating inside, but not much."}
{"text":"You know what your getting with this place but extra points to the very friendly smiling staff, the amazing pita wrapper that tears off midway to avoid sauce drips, and the calorie info up front on the menu. 

Chicken Caeser Pita was barebones but pretty darn fresh all things considered. They grill up the chicken in front of you."}
{"text":"I dislike this place very much.  Every time I have gone, my pita has been dry, thin, and tasteless; the fillings have been sub-par (at best); and the service has been present in body but not in mind (something I won't hold against them personally, it generally comes with fast food).  I generally have a standby with Middle Eastern food by which I judge most Middle Eastern locations: the falafel.  The falafel is simple in its design, only ground chickpeas, salt, some spices, and a dip in searing hot oil.  However, every place makes theirs slightly different, and these minor variations make all the difference.  I figure: if you can't get a falafel right, then what can you get right?  So, how does Extreme Pita's falafels hold up? In short: they are terrible.  They are dry, tasteless, wads of unloved chickpeas.  
However, I think it's unfair to judge a place solely on one mistake. Extreme Pita sells many non-Middle Eastern items on their menu, maybe it's just not their forte.  So, I ordered myself a chicken-based wrap to find that it was given the same care and attention the falafels recieved: next to nil.

In short, do not go to Extreme Pita unless you absolutely have to.  There is nothing inherently wrong with their food, but there is nothing right with it either."}
{"text":"I come to this place frequently with my family for a healthy no-guilt choice of food. The service is quick and it tastes fresh. the rustic Italian, fiesta Mexicans, and philly steak are solid choices. Not a fan of the buffalo chicken or chicken shawarma - but maybe that's just me. I'd recommend trying it for its healthy options!"}
{"text":"Healthy, quick and pretty good. Definitely a better and healthier choice than mcdonalds or any other fast food resturant"}
{"text":"The person who served us was rude. As he was doing some kind of favor that he is giving us a pita. No one should behave with customers like this."}
{"text":"Love the pitas.  Can get a very healthy delicious pita. Nutrient chart so you know what you are eating.  Staff can be friend or not but good is delicious.  Best fast food ever."}
{"text":"Something I love about this location of Extreme Pita, is how clean and efficient it is.  Even during the busy lunch hour, the place is fully staffed with employees who do a good job at making sure your order is right. 

Something else I like is how all the calories are posted, clear to see. 

The food is always fresh and there are more filling options than say, the average sub shop. (Chickpeas, kidney beans, broccoli, etc.) 

Keep your eyes peeled for BOGO coupons in coupon booklets...and know the regular size is really big.  I always get the smaller sized option...and even that can be too much sometimes!"}
{"text":"We ordered and we're charged for 2 reg pitas but we were given 2 small ones. It wasn't until we got home and started eating that we realized. The store was really dirty; the floors, the doors, the tables. Yuk."}
{"text":"Expectations are always low at quick service restaurants. This one lived right up to my expectations. Staff are depressing & unfriendly."}
{"text":"I came in on a Tuesday during the extreme tasty Tuesday specials. The small is $5 the regular was 7 which is $0.50 off the regular price of $7.49. When I ask for the vegetables to put in my pita the clerk informed me that vegetables are extra charges.  

That's crazy...  I go to pita place to avoid eating a burger,  but if you want a healthy vegetable, it's $0.50 cents extra.   In the end,  I paid over $9.00 with tax for just the pita...  No drink.

The store is not at fault...  It's the corporate policy that is just stupidity when I can go to any other restaurant for equal or less money,  WITHOUT GETTING NICKEL AND DIMED.  

Corporate... Learn something.."}
{"text":"I tried Extreme Pita for the first time in a pinch, it was 8:00 pm and I needed some dinner fast.  I went with my fiance who likes the healthy alternatives, I had pita before from Master Pita and Pita Pit both I remember being pretty decent. 

I had the buffalo chicken and she had the chiptole chicken.  Before we left the problems with this place started.  The girl who served us was friendly and accommodating, the one who cashed me out ripped me off.  Both pitas were $6.99, lets do the math.  $6.99 + $6.99 = $13.98.  $13.98 x 1.13 for tax = $15.80.  So the girl rings me up, I didn't think about the cost and just tapped my mastercard, it wasn't until I got outside that I thought about the series of events.  When the receipt came out before I could say anything she grabbed it and squashed it in her and tossed it in the trash, never offered it to me.  She ended up charging me $17.38 for my $15.80 dinner, no idea how she  came up to that amount but she did. 

That was the first offense, the second came when we at the food.  I commented the food had no flavour, my fiance didn't really like hers so I had a bit of it and it had no flavour either.

So between the fact I was ripped off and the food being sub par I won't be going back.  In the same plaza is a Five Guys burgers.  In my opinion Five Guys is a bit over priced and too greasy but it's still a much better option than this place."}
{"text":"Worst location for Extreme Pita. They do not grill anything fresh. If you go at lunch time you will not see anything hit the grill as it is all done in the morning. Cold chicken, onions and mushrooms in the buffalo chicken pita. I've gone back a few times to see if it was just a bad day, only to be disappointed every time. Today was no different, except for the added disappointment of forgotten buffalo sauce. Several coworkers have boycotted this location, and now I will do the same. There is a reason that there is no line up here at noon in a bustling food court."}
{"text":"Better than I expected. Got the chicken cesar pita. Delicious. I got garlic pita chips as well, and they were pretty good. Would have been better if I had gotten the hummus.

I was tempted to try one of the gyro pitas. But wasn't sure if it'd be as good as an actual gyro/greek place. Maybe next time?"}
{"text":"I am giving this place five stars because it delivers what it is supposed to...fast, fresh, healthy and tasty food. It is our go to spot for food to sneak into the theatre. It is consistently good."}
{"text":"This may sound totally lame, but my favourite thing about this place is the wrapper for the pita. It's designed so that you don't end up with your pita falling apart or sauces dripping out the bottom all over your hands/clothes. It's sort of like half bag/half wrapper, and it has a perforated line so you can easily tear off the top. Fantastic design. Slightly surprised every burrito joint in town isn't using it.

And there's no nickel & diming over at extreme pita - You have your choice of toppings and sauces. There is no extra charge to add grilled mushrooms, peppers and onions to your pita. 

Lots of healthy options for the calorie counters out there - in fact, the nutritional info is on the napkin."}
{"text":"The owner is always yelling at the staff with a northern attitude, from the grill. Also, I echo the review about the staff, I can only assume based on poor social skills, they're hiring cheap labor. Also, they're cutting corners by using cheap iceberg lettuce rather then romain lettuce as demonstrated on their corporate website.  This is probably my 6th visit since they opened, they're consistently mediocre, I can simply say I'm not hungry after eating here. I guess I keep coming back thinking it'll be like pita pit on college st. in uptown..."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this. But, it got ruined. It was like there was rocks in the pita. Bit into something super hard. It looked like a sliver of a rock. Then a few bites down, got another pebble like material in it. I didn't finish the pita. It will be a long time before I go back."}
{"text":"It was just OK.  Wouldn't pay that much for a mediocre pita again.  There are other related options close by which may suite you better.  Wasn't as fresh as I'd expect and they were very chincy with the toppings, asking for \"more\" was ignored and it wasn't an unreasonable request.  Likely won't return."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch the other day and ordered a chicken souvlaki pita.  The girl working up front was very friendly and it only took a couple of minutes to order, get my food and pay.  The pita was really tasty and didn't leave me feeling stuffed.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just tried this pita place for lunch as they had mailed my office some coupons and I was pleasantly surprised! They had way more toppings than I expected (bean mix, broccoli salad, tabbouleh, 3 different kinds of hummus and tons of fresh veggies). I also really liked their tuna option, as it's not mixed with mayonnaise, allowing you to create your own 'tuna salad' wrap by choosing from their hummus options or other sauces.

 It's really convenient that they list the calories for the pitas and for $6, the 'regular' size was a perfect portion! I'm definitely coming back to try their falafel and veggie pita, too."}
{"text":"Ugh. I used go to Extreme Pita all time as a young'un so when I was in this plaza at lunch time I was overwhelmed by nostalgia and thought, \"Why not? Let's go see if it lives up to the memories.\" 

I ordered the chipotle chicken pita in the regular size. Firstly, the pita is not toasted so that's not good. Secondly, my pita was barely filled with any vegetables or chicken (hardly any lettuce which is so damn cheap) so it wasn't worth what they charged me for the regular size. Many of my bites at the top and bottom were just plain, untoasted pita. Finally, this pita was smothered in gloppy sweet sauce (it was just straight up sweet, there was no \"chipotle\" heat at all). There was honestly more sauce than veggies or chicken. It was gross. I kept cringing from the gloppy sweetness as I ate. I probably should have gone up and returned it (it was that bad), but I just kept slogging through. Why do I do that to myself? You deserve better, woman!

A server passed by my table and asked how I liked the pita. I answered honestly that there was just way too much sauce and not enough filling to absorb that sauce. She said, \"Yeah, that chipotle chicken has more sauce than vegetables.\" Seriously? Seriously, girl? What the hell. I'm sure that's not what they're teaching you people in pita assembly school. There's no way some food designer purposely came up with the monstrosity that I ate today.

Lesson learned: don't let nostalgia rule your stomach. Your taste buds as a kid are not the same as your adult taste buds. Or, this was just a really crappily made pita. I don't know; take your pick."}
{"text":"I went here on Sunday for the first time.  The staff were VERY friendly and helpful.    I had a Mediterranean pizza and it was yummy!!  The place was clean and quiet.   The food was fresh and healthy.  Only con was I brought my 2 year old nephew and the store didn't have any high chairs...."}
{"text":"Great place, owner is very decent and suggest you food according to your taste, they have limited vegi options. I tried all, believe me all taste goods"}
{"text":"Great friendly service and perfect veggie bowl customized that was delicious. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with some friends this weekend. The food was amazing! I had the chicken club pita and it was so delicious. Normally when I eat at a sandwich shop, I am ready for sandwich number two after about an hour or so, but I was satisfied and wasn't hungry until dinner time (for a first!). The service left a little to be desired, it took a bit of time to get our food, and I think we repeated out order about 4 times before they \"got it\". But, I would totally go back, too bad there isn't on in my neck of the woods."}
{"text":"I love this healthy alternative. Fresh ingredients and always yummy. Compared to a subway, port of subs or other sandwich shop, it really is much better. 

I do not think I have ever had a bad meal here and I have been coming here regularly for at least 3 years now."}
{"text":"Surprised at all the bad reviews. Stopped here today and ordered a chicken Schwarma. This was my first time ever to an extreme pita location anywhere. 

I was pleased to see the calorie count on the menu. I like the way they mixed all the ingredients in a bowl before putting it into the pita. Made for a nice mix. 

Food tasted fresh, was flavorful, and I was in and out quickly. I'd definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for places like this. I was truly caught between a burger and a pizza place and this location saved me from making a decision my stomach would regret later. 

Although it's a chain, this location is a great franchise hidden in the Elgin Mills and Leslie plaza across from Richmond Green Park. If you're searching healthy quick lunch options in this neck of the woods, this may be your only choice and its a choice worth making.

Two things made my visit an enjoyable one. The first was the super friendly staff, the gentleman who served me was jovial and warm and engaged my in actual conversation insofar that I wanted to stay longer chewing the fat with him (and potentially a second Pita).

The other key thing I had never noticed about Extreme Pita was the Healthy options on menu all with a prominently displayed calorie count. Surprisingly enough the Chicken Caesar is one of the healthiest items on the menu, coming in under 300 calories.  

Despite the healthy Chicken Caesar options I asked the clerk for his personal fav and he recommended that I try the Bourbon Chipotle Chicken Pita. At 560 calories it was a great healthy option to cure my midday hangryness and I felt better for destroying this in no time than I would have had I gone for the pizza/burger option.

I'll be back for the food and even for the company."}
{"text":"very disappointed.  got a mexican fiesta pita and the flavour was very bland.  the chopped chicken was made from that boiled or blanched stuff that is processed to death.  there was hot seasoning, but it was mostly all hot and not much else for flavour.

I would not have it again"}
{"text":"They are closed!
 Was bummed because I saw all the positive reviews!


Ended up next door at Skewer's and had a great meal."}
{"text":"First time at Extreme Pita.  It is a little different than Pita Pit. I had the small smoked turkey and my husband had the buffalo chick.  Was not impressed with the food nor the staff. Not sure we will go back."}
{"text":"Love me some pitas!!!

This place is really wonderful. A great healthy alternative to all the grease and fried goodies we typically enjoy for lunch. Extreme Pita is happy to post the calories for all pitas on the wall as soon as you walk in and offer a variety of fresh veggies and toppings for your pitas. Another great thing about this place, is that they offer two sizes here, small and regular, no matter what you choose depending on how hungry you are I'm sure you will be satisfied when you leave. 

Today I tried the featured pita which was the Club which has turkey, ham and bacon with grilled onions, mushrooms and peppers. Then I loaded it up with tons of great toppings, like lettuce, cheddar cheese, pickles, jalapenos and banana peppers. For sauces, I opted for the Extreme Pita sauce which reminds me a little of chipotle mayo mixed with hot sauce. It's my favorite sauce because it's overloaded with flavor and a little bit of the honey mustard (which was suggested by my pita expert and he was right it added just the right amount of sweet and spicy to my pita)

Everyone that works here is always very helpful, and full of suggestions on how to enjoy your pita and they have a V. I. Pita Card where you get a stamp with each pita you enjoy and after 10th one, you get to enjoy one for free!"}
{"text":"I just love pitas and this place has some darn good ones. They certainly do the trick any time I have a pita craving. When you walk in it feels like a regular fast food restaurant. The set up is very similar to Subway but with pitas instead of subs. The special $3.99 chicken pita is such a great value. You can't beat that price! The vegetables are always fresh and they have a great variety of sauces and cheeses. The pitas are fresh and they throw them on the grill to beat them up. They are ready quickly and service is friendly. It's worth a stop by!"}
{"text":"Not a good meal - just a nasty pile of ingredients, including way too much spinach and chicken that was basically bad quality. The girls behind counter take the stuff and grill it for like 45 seconds (not even hot) and then dump all the stuff into a plastic container and douse it with a ton of dressing. All of that gets mixed up and dumped into a cold pita and then twisted and ready to eat or in my case - ready for the garbage can. i thought there were good deals at student dining places, but this place is just like a mall food court, no deals in sight."}
{"text":"Love this place. Super quick, super healthy. They always ask to make sure you're okay with every ingredient in the recipe before they start making your wrap. It's always clean and it's overall an enjoyable spot to grab a bite."}
{"text":"I keep forgetting about Extreme Pita, but I don't know why because it's always good, fast, and reasonably priced.

At lunch time today, I wasn't sure what I wanted  so just headed over to Ballantyne Village. I drove by Extreme Pita & decided to stop in.

The ingredients are really fresh and I like the fact that you can choose  different toppings, cheese, and sauces to build your own \"free-style\" pita. Whether you eat meat, only chicken, or if you are a vegetarian,  there is something for everyone here.

I got garlic pita chips & regular hummus with my pita and it was all very good. I definitely need to keep it higher on my list of go-to fast lunch spots.

By the way, when I checked in on Yelp, I got a discounted offer for 10% off.  Gotta love that!"}
{"text":"The pitas are made with fresh ingredients.   Lots of choices available.   I had the Chicken Souvlaki pita and my friend had the Beef Gyros.   The feta cheese they use is really high quality.   The chicken was well flavoured.  I opted for the whole wheat pita, and it was pretty good.

We were both impressed with the quality, the nice environment and the friendly staff.  The location has free parking and there are a tonne of stores around it.  Its close to the Walmart."}
{"text":"I'm an avid pita supporter. I've been to other pita places in town and they all seem to be sparsely planted throughout different parts of Uptown or in odd shopping centers. happy to find Extreme Pita is easily accessible and I can park right in front of the shop!

Nestled in Ballantyne village next to Moe's, Extreme Pita is a great little shotgun set up with a few tables and a couple two-seaters outside. Love that this location is on the quieter side of the Village. Not as many cars fighting for parking. You get to avoid the congestion altogether. 

I've been here several times and it's always nice and reliable. Nothing I've had has ever been too heavy, greasy or inherently \"heavy.\" I've had a few meat and veggie options. I've never been displeased with any! The club, grilled chicken and gyro are all great choices. 

I'm happy to say that the falafel is by far my favorite. Nice crispy orbs of falafel can be on my pita any day. They do a good job of cooking everything on the flat top grill. 

The pitas are nice and thin and, much like other places, you can have them fill it to the rafters with veggies, tzatziki, hummus, sauces and your choice of protein. 

They do these odd flat pitas that are supposed to be \"pizza-like.\" Not sure that I'd ever venture down that road, but could be good for the kiddos. 

My wife and I are fans of this place. Light, healthy and affordable for both of us. Great after a long walk on the McMullen Greenway!"}
{"text":"Like an upscale Subway with Pitas.  Enjoyed the Thai Chicken, but wasn't blown away.  This isn't Haji Baba but better than Subway."}
{"text":"A poor excuse for an expensive gyro.
Soft/mushy fries not crisp"}
{"text":"Have you ever wondered what garbage tastes like?  Have you fantasized about cold chicken that is over cooked and stored with no flavour? No one has... so why does this establishment think that this is OK?  

We ordered chicken and goat cheese pitas with tzatziki.  The girl behind the counter literally took a huge dollop of tzatziki and spread it on the pita... twice.  It's like a goat jizzed on my pita... horrible.  

The pita was split down the middle like Moses had a staff in his hand and the pita was the red Sea.   Horribly wrapped and horribly priced.  I would never recommend this garbage.  I wouldn't feed this to pigs that I disliked.  

Never recommend any extreme pita establishment."}
{"text":"Terrible. Terrible service, bland food, dirty seating area."}
{"text":"This place is real good for feeding your wife before a movie. It's way cheaper than most of the other restaurants around the area and it's pretty healthy so your wife won't get a pot belly. Win win in my book. 

Also you can probably sneak a pita into the movies if you're short on time. This is a lot better than eating a whole bunch of popcorn."}
{"text":"This is the first and last time I will ever go there.  The food was mediocre at best.  The woman behind the counter, who I'm assuming is the owner or manager, was a complete b*tch.  I asked for a regular cup for water and she told the kid ringing me up to charge me full price.  I do not drink out of styrofoam so I just went without a drink.  

There are way too many choices for lunch in Ballantyne....with better food and nicer staff."}
{"text":"The food wasn't good at all. Ordered the chicken chipotle. First of all had way too much bbq sauce in it. Second there was no chicken in the chicken chipotle :/. The wrap was breaking apart, just after 2 bites. I don't even know why I even ate it. I guess cause I paid $5 for a small wrap. Worst decision ever."}
{"text":"I have been returning to Extreme Pita for a few years now and I have to say I like it and that I am a fan.  I usually get the Falafal or the Bourbon Chipotle.  I never get weighted down eating there.  Lots of veggies and thin pita bread.  The price is right for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where the address comes from.  This place is on Normal (it's in the Memorial Union).

Anyway, I come here relatively often when I'm on campus, and I have to say that I quite enjoy the place.  The food is all relatively fresh, there is a broad menu selection, and tons of fillings to choose from!

I almost always go for the $5 combo.  It's a regular veggie pita, pita chips, and a drink.  Fill that sucker up with veggies, hummus, garbanzo beans, peppers, and toss on a dressing (maybe a bit of italian), and you've got a tasty, health, quick, and cheap meal.  It beats the hell out of the Taco Bell around the corner on freshness and nutrition.  Taco Bell may win on price, but this place wins on value (since you're, you know, getting food and what not instead of, well, Taco Bell).

If you're not going the $5 veggie route, it loses a bit of it's appeal since a lot of the other stuff can get up there in price.  I've tried other things, though, and they've all been good so far.  The meat, when I get it, is usually very fresh (they grill it right there).

Oh, and I know this is weird, but I like their packaging.  The pita's are wrapped in a handy two-piece wrapper.  You tear the top 2/3 off and are left with the bottom as a nice handle.  It's very neat and clean, especially when you get something liquid in there (like a dressing).  It also makes it easily to walk with it if you're in a real hurry.

All in all, not a bad choice on-campus.  It's a good meal at a good price, and way healthier than pizza or burgers.  Don't make a trip to the Tempe Campus for it, but if you need something while you're already there, you can't go wrong at the unfortunately named Extreme Pita."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a healthy and quick lunch, and honestly the food is pretty good here.  Unfortunately, the service - by the owner and the employees - is horrible and I won't be going back.  

I went to Extreme Pita today with 2 other coworkers at 11:15 a.m.  We were the ONLY one's in the store, so we beat the lunch rush.  However, it still took them at least 10 minutes to make our sandwiches.  I got the veggie pita with a water and chips and it was $10.

What really upset me was that I asked for hot sauce on the side.  The owner filled it up not even half way.  I didn't get any sauce whatsoever on my pita, this was all I asked for.  I used the half of a container she gave me, and went up to get more.  She said she would have to charge me $0.59 for additional hot sauce.  

I do think it's outrageous that I couldn't get enough hot sauce for my pita without being charged.  At most establishments, hot sauce is on the table, given at no charge.  

WAY too stingy with the sauce.  You lost our entire party's business over an ounce of hot sauce."}
{"text":"Tried going today and the space was empty with the windows blocked out.  I don't think they ever recovered from the bad employees thay hae for a year or two.  So many people hated going there that they just stopped.  Also, One time Iwent it was 30 minutes to get place my order and get my food - that includes the family of four in front of me that left or else it would have been longer."}
{"text":"Horrible place. New management. The teen girl is embarrassed to work there so there is NO eye contact nor did anyone hear me ask questions...I was informed and then given a bill. 

First off talk to your customers....make sure all the fixans are what they want. Sorry but I don't work here....so obviously I don't know how to make your solvaki pita. Everyone makes their differently. I hate olives and I hate pickles so wtf.  Anyways never NEVER coming back to this expensive sh*t ever again. ZERO stars. Gross gross gross."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a weekday before noon, and we ordered two regular size gyro pitas. I got lettuce, tomato, red onion, banana peppers, jalapeños, grilled pineapple, pickles, tzatziki, feta and hot sauce. The lady who took our order was very friendly and did not skimp on the toppings - that's what makes or breaks a pita place! The ingredients were all very fresh and the pitas were packed to the brim, with the ingredients very well distributed; from the first to the last bite, there was an equal amount of all ingredients."}
{"text":"Not terrible is best way to describe this place. Falafel was hot and almost marginally flavorful. No whole wheat pitas available which makes no sense at an otherwise semi-healthy place. They were out of a number of toppings but the staff was friendly, so kicking them up to three stars."}
{"text":"Okay if you are dieting then this place is a godsend! The buffalo chicken pita is under 300 calories and incredibly filling. In fact, they have all of the calories and nutrition listed on the wall. The service is always quick and friendly and the food is great. Perfect for a quick lunch bite."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a workshop today... is Yonge and Sheppard even part of Toronto? As I left the house in such a hurry, I forgot my delicious lunch on the kitchen counter. I am seldom in this area so during lunch break I wandered to the Food Court of the Sheppard Centre. This place is packed during lunch hour; if you're an indecisive person, you're screwed! Luckily, I am a very practical person and was able to go back to my workshop in a mere fifteen minutes. 

I only had thirty minutes for lunch so I chose the shortest line. The winner - Extreme Pita. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. Big mistake - it didn't sit too well. For $6 (small sized pita), I paid for my upset stomach in the afternoon.

Meh, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"I can't tell if this place is new or not but it's super clean inside and the menu items are nice and fresh. I was gonna create my own but I'll try all their recipes first. The first one I had is the grilled chicken with goat cheese and it was so fresh I swear I didn't need to shower for the next few days."}
{"text":"Extreme Pita is a great place to stop for a quick lunch in the Ballantyne area.  It's in the Ballantyne Village which is a little tricky to get into and out of, but if you go early you can miss the crowds.  Once it gets busy, that place gets hectic!

The set up here is similar to Subway in that you can essentially build your own pita by picking any toppings and sauces you want and watching the folks behind the glass put it together for you.  There is a huge sign on the back wall that you cannot miss that gives you the nutrition info on all of their pitas as well, so you can have an idea of exactly what you're about to scarf down.  If you're a Ballantyne Corporate Card holder, you can add a drink and chips for free.  That's a pretty sweet perk.  

I've eaten here many a time and have always enjoyed it.  The Thai chicken is my favorite, and the Chicken Souvlaki is also really good.  Even though it's technically fast food (I guess?) you don't come away feeling like you just ate half a cow.  Highly recommend this place if you want a quick, healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"Perfect place in the Ballentyne Village to grab a quick healthy lunch. 

They display the calories right on the menu so you can do good with out much effort. 

I've had their chicken slouvaki small pita (hold the onions), and their veggie pita, both very good. Perfect and guiltless.

Ask for their frequent card!"}
{"text":"I remember when this place opened.

I got the whole rundown from the franchise owner.

It's a Canadian operation that deliverers on healthy options in a sandwich/wrap shop.

I have a fun story about this particular location though.  

I came in for lunch and was about to order when the staff took one look at me and all the mexicans ran out the back door.  The owner was obviously not working the store anymore.  

The manager-guy was like \"OH HI THERE!  HO HO HO!  PRETTY FUNNY, EH?\"

He was freaking out pretty hard.

I realized that I was wearing a polo shirt that read \"INS.\"  Now it didn't stand for immigration, but the people working the grill didn't stick around to find out what I was about.

The manager bribed me with cookies for my silence... until now!

The food was better when a MBA was cooking.  Now it's just a bunch of dudes who slop stuff into a pita instead of a burger bun.

It's pretty hard to screw up falafel though, so give that a try if you want some veggie options."}
{"text":"Super disappointed! Mostly because they had minimal topping selection and what they did have, sucked. 
Tomatoes were cut in huge chunks.
The tabbouleh was just parsley! That is not tabbouleh.
Will not return to this location."}
{"text":"3.5, maybe?
I agree with Todd's review... regarding what you would expect from a pita place.
Hubby and I went here over a year ago I think, and walked out of the place without ordering. Why? Because once you step in, this does not seem to be a Mediterranean restaurant, neither a gyros place.
The options didn't seem appealing and we left.

Today we were short on time, and we had to make a quick decision. Well, if someone handed this food to you and you didn't have any expectations, maybe it would be 5 stars. 
We had the gyros wrap, and the steak chipotle or something like that. I chose small because we were in a hurry and some other reasons, but it seems that for a dollar more (6.79 I think) you can get a considerably bigger wrap. Maybe next time we can share one...

However, I found kind of confusing what ingredients I could get, and I didn't get much into it.

Like Todd described, they use the pita like a pocket and stuff it with whatever you ask for. Mine had lettuce, jalapeños, tomato and cucumber. Feta cheese, Greek dressing and tzatziki. Well, tzatziki looked more like plain yogurt... and the scary part was the frozen whatever meat. It seems all the meats are frozen, and if they cook them in the back room, oh well, maybe. But when they heat them in front of you... not so appealing.
What I did like is that at the end, they shape it and wrap it as a burrito, and you can remove the top part of the wrap to eat and since you have the bottom part of the wrap still intact, it does not get messy.

By the way, the young man that took my order and prepared half of my food was very kind and friendly. I particularly liked how he explained to me how to remove the wrap : )"}
{"text":"(3.5) ~ good overall food & service

MY MENU:
** Belgium Chocolate Bar = (4) very good
* Thai Beef Pita = (3) ok...kinda bland"}
{"text":"Bought the chicken souvlaki pita. Two thirds of the pita were all vegetables.  Once I got to the bottom of the pita, there were 5 chunks of salty chicken breast.  

Overall, my meal was ok. The place was clean and the employees were very friendly. However, I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This place is great for a fast pita joint. Its like a Pita Subway, the actually really should rename this place PIta Subway. Cause you order and you go through and tell them what you want on it as you watch through the glass. The ingredients are fresh and its a healthy fast meal. The even have make your own Pita Pizza, which is awesome! This isn't your Pita Jungle or anything but its yum for what it is. This kinda reminds me of that Simpson's episode where they had the Fleeta Pita franchise. Extreme Pita is basically Fleeta Pita :)"}
{"text":"Expecting just another fast food boring place, I went here for my first visit last year.  Since then, I am there so often that I blow through their Pita Cards!!  This is really a little gem here in the village.  The staff is always so nice and fun.  Ryan is a pleasure to talk to.  They are always very pleasant and knowledgeable, and make your pitas any way you like.  

The dining area and food areas are always spotless, and the menu is bright and bold and really easy to navigate.  The food is fresh and tasty and never wrong, and they have tons of lower calorie items to choose from that are all delicious!

The Pita Card is great....just get it punched with every pita you buy and you get one free after every 10.  They also have coupons in the little magazines and flyers you get in the mail.  The only thing they don't have is the option to order on-line and pick up, which would be helpful for those of us who stop in on our way home from work.

All in all, this is a really great place with awesome food and happy staff....all in a clean environment and for great prices!"}
{"text":"Tried the Limited Edition Jerk Chicken Pita and it was one of the worst wraps I've had in my life.

The staff was friendly--no problems there!

But whoever gave the \"ok\" to sell this horrid wrap needs a Taste Testing asap.
There is a reason why Jerk Sauce is COOKED/GRILLED or BAKED on chicken or pork. It's not the kind of sauce you dip or drizzle on food. The sauce was super spicy which I would normally love but absolutely no flavor other than bitterness. The thyme in the sauce was so potent it over powered the whole wrap.  It was literally grilled chicken and veggies with cold jerk sauce poured on top of it. Save your money! This is NOT a winner!"}
{"text":"Extreme Pita's is a reliable, if unexciting, quick lunch spot.  The food's ok: there's not really the Mediterranian twist you would expect--you'll find things like Chicken Souvlaki, but also Buffalo Chicken and Thai Beef.  It eats, however, and they post the calorie counts for their entrees on the menu, which is great if you like to make sure you're not pigging out during the workweek.  

Service is a little brusque, but the staff isn't actually downright rude, and they don't really have time to be chatty during the lunch rush anyways.  Also, if you are fortunate enough to have the Ballantyne Corporate discount card, you get 15% off.  Find out if you can get that piece o' plastic, and if you can, work it.

It's good to have a healthy fast food options in the area, so if you get tired of Panera, check out this joint."}
{"text":"Very surprised with the bad reviews. Staff was friendly, the place was clean which is much more than what I could say about Five Guys next door (which has cockroach sighting!!!!!). 

It is fresh and healthy stuff so be prepared for it. No usual grease and crap of fast food. Their little wrapping system means no mess eating a pita wrap. 

Also everything is mixed in a bowl first so all the ingredients are evenly distributed in the wrap - very tasty. 

Also had the Kale smoothie and expected it to be gross....but it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Right in the heart of Ballantyne, Extreme Pita has a great location, great idea, and customers willing to pay, but can they take advantage of these three items?

Walking in, you first notice how small the place is. There are about 6 tables inside, that's it. The menu is posted (with calories) above where you order; however, the things in each pita are only listed on a sheet of paper that is only seen when you order, so you sort of have to wing it until the last second. You watch them make your pita right in front of you, and if you want extra this or that, they're usually pretty attentive and have no problem adding or subtracting items. 

The chicken caesar is good, but it's really not spectacular. Not that I would expect i to be--lettuce, chicken, croutons, no bacon for me. It's...good. Chip selection is very good, they have my Garden Salsa Sun Chips here, which I like. 

The staff are pretty good, but you really don't have much interaction with them, especially on a busy day. They get the order right every time, so I have nothing to complain about there.

If you're looking for a fast casual, healthy option in Ballantyne, give Extreme Pita a shot!"}
{"text":"This is the worst extreme pita ever. Service was slow- I can put up with. Bad food- can't. Ordered a buffalo chicken. They claim chicken was grilled but it was cold. Prob grilled two hours ago. Sauce and ingredients was not tossed- uneven throughout the pita. Pita bread seem like its aged. I want my money back. Never again. Hope Brookfield kick them out and get a proper food tenant."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Moe's in this shopping center, but decided to try to this place next door...worst decision ever. When you look at their pita descriptions, they actually sound halfway decent, and then you eat them. I got a teriyaki chicken pita and a greek/mediterranean style pita to go, the meat they use in them is disgusting. It's rubbery, and gross, it's got to have been cooked several weeks prior and come out of a bag. The vegetables that were supposed to have been sauteed with it were raw and also seemed to have come out of some mix. The most disappointing thing is that they have a flat iron grill right behind the counter and could easily just cook fresh meats, but use this pre-prepared crap instead."}
{"text":"Average.
Clean interior, staff friendly, on the slow side.
Better than many fast food options."}
{"text":"Sad to see this location closed....... Been coming here for many years.  Ingredients were always fresh, staff very friendly."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with my lunch stop today. Hot a small chicken Shwarma pita and let me tell you it was damn tasty.  Lettuce, tomato, pickle, hummus, tabouli, taziki sauce, and a generous scoop of freshly grilled chicken. The chicken was grilled fresh right in front of me.

The texture from the crunchy vegetables, smooth sauces and hot grilled chicken was really nice and the \"small\" size wasn't small at all.

Service was friendly and professional.

Pretty damned good for airport food."}
{"text":"Ordered the small Chipotle Chicken Pita with all the fixins, which included cheddar cheese, roasted peppers, onions, chipotle BBQ mayo, as well as a whole lot of lettuce! I also got a small Kale a cab smoothie, which consisted of kale, cabbage, mangoes, blueberries, passion-orange guava juice from Pur Blendz, that shares the same spot.

I was definitely not a fan of the smoothie as it tasted like watered down frozen fruits, and honestly did not taste like it included all those ingredients, which was probably why it took less than a minute to make. It sure wasn't blended well with all the frozen fruit, as I had to mix it in order to be able to drink it. 

The chicken, onions and peppers are warmed up on the flat top when you order, which was good to know, however the whole pita was stuffed with so much lettuce it was falling apart. Even for a small pita, they definitely skimped on the chicken. As there are plenty of food options at the mall, it's not hard to find some healthier options like Extreme Pita, however next time I might just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The owner is the nicest guy and so pleasant to deal with. Definitely coming back really soon"}
{"text":"I give them an A or effort, but they are not what I was hoping. The concept looked amazing on paper and I was so excited to try their food. I walked in and it was very blah. There wasn't anything that made me WANT to eat there except me seeing their menu online. I got the buffalo chicken pita and was super excited because I love buffalo wings and sandwiches!  Unfortunately I was let done. It tasted ok but also tasted very \"fake\". I didn't feel like it was fresh or high quality. I was hoping for more. Would I go back? Maybe if I was already there with no where to et but I wouldn't make a conscious decision to no."}
{"text":"Pita is delicious! The problem I have was with the service! The attendant was grumpy, stingy on ingredients and throwing the pads around. She had more interest in complaining about how she has to work a twelve hour shift than helping customers. She complained about coworkers and moved so slow I almost missed my flight! I am extremely disappointed and will not return to the extreme pita in Pearson if I see that worker again. Thanks for the pita though!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Great alternative in way of faster and a healthier food choice. The service is relatively fast."}
{"text":"Today was my first stop to this awesome place here in Ballantyne. I love felafel and hummus. This place was able to offer me both in one wrap which means I was happy :) 

I enter the facility and there few customer having lunch as well as few employees ready to help. One lady asked me, how can I help? So I said, this is my first time here so give me a couple of mins to check your menu and she said sure. 

I figured out what I wanted to eat so I said I am ready. I ordered myself vegetarian felafel with spicy hummus. I know right, they had I think three or four different choices for hummus and mayo. Not to mention, they had huge selection of veg options as well. 

I paid for my meal with CC and that's when I saw a card which says they have reward opportunity and I can use my iOS device to keep track. I was all for it because I don't like keeping those cards and its good for the environment :D 

The only reason this place didn't get five star was because the lady at the register was pre-occupied in talking to her coworker and didn't focus of customer."}
{"text":"Tried this place because of the two can dine for $9.99 coupon sent to me. Two small pitas, two chips and two pop. Had the Mexican pita and my gf had the chicken shawarma. Extremely small  and can't be considered great value even with the coupon. Service was great so I made it two stars instead of one"}
{"text":"Extreme Pita is a great healthy option for a tasty meal on the go.  They have a wide variety of pita, salads and pizzas.  They also have a full service smoothie bar and bake their desserts on site.  It is a Subway type set up where you choose a protein and select your toppings.  There are preselected items to go on it, but the staff confirms what you want on it several times anyway.
I had the regular Philly Cheese Steak.   It was very good and quite a reasonable value.  The pita itself is kind of flat, but it is rolled like a burrito so they couldn't go to fluffy.  The thinly sliced steak was cooked on the flat top and covered with onions, peppers and cheese.  It was loaded into the warm pita with lettuce and some other veggies.  It was very good - I almost ordered another to go for later in the day.   A bonus is all the calorie and fat counts are posted on the menu board.  Who would have thunk that a Philly could be under 400 calories if you take off the mayo.
I will definitely try Extreme Pita again if I see them down in the States."}
{"text":"Bad food and even worse service. 
I walked into this location at noon hour and the place was deserted. There were 3 employees, including the owner who never bothered to acknowledge me or even say hello. Needless to say, I felt extremely uncomfortable, since they clearly did not value my business, I promptly walked out. 
On my way out, a young white customer walked in and the old indian gentleman went out of his way to very loudly greet her. 

I went previously with some coworkers and the pita was so dry it cracked, there was barely any meat or sauce in my pita. 
If you are looking for a good pita, I would recommend Mucho Burrito, Osmow's or Pita and Grille, guaranteed good food, service and value for your money. 

Avoid this extreme pita location at all costs!"}
{"text":"For some reason Extreme Pita isn't able to top the food at nearby Pita Pit. It's not that their isn't a good amount of pita selection ranging from those with beef to all veggie, or that they don't stuff those pitas full with lots of vegetables like they should. It's because I can't taste anything in those pitas! Today my pita was filled up with all sorts of nice veggies, humus, hot sauce, feta, and tzatziki . I caught the tzatziki but everything else just kind of transformed into cardboard in my mouth. Must be the large chain syndrome.

Still, thanks for filling me up, and it's always nice to have a healthy fast food joint nearby."}
{"text":"Clean ambiance.  Tasty wrap.  Served hot with lots of customization.  A great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Great place to get a pita the way you want it.
So many different toppings and sauces.
You can get a completely different taste every time.
This time in I kept to the menu and had the chipotle chicken... real good."}
{"text":"Healthy, thoughtful, low cal wraps that are prepared quick for a great meal on the go.

I like you, Extreme Pita. You're a good, healthy choice for me and in a world of crap easy choices, I appreciate that you make it easy to say \"Yes, I'd like to order the Cajun wrap\" and know that I'm only eating 500 calories (as opposed to that awesome lunch buffet @ Villa Antonio which who knows how many calories I consume there!).

The downside to Extreme Pita is the lack of side options. We've got fresh pita chips but no salsa, no hummus, no pasta or potato salad, not even a side salad. So for all us non-chip lovers out there, we're out of luck.

Staff is always helpful and quick - Parking is easy - All in all, worth a stop in! Your body and waistline will thank you and your tastebuds will too!"}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks.  I was starving for lunch one day and popped in and ordered a buffalo chicken wrap.  I swear there was maybe one once of chicken, a teaspoon of blue cheese and some veggies.  It was so dry, had no flavour and the pita was wrapped loose, which made it very messy.  The crap cost over $7.00 too - I felt robbed. All the staff looked like they didn't want to be there which made for a poor environment.  I hope they close down and a better restaurant comes in because it's good location."}
{"text":"They changed ownership.  Not as good now with fewer selection, and need to pay extra for toppings (even the tomatoes and cucumber!).   They no longer have my favourite sirloin steak I think it was.  The previous owner was wonderful, can even have it in a bowl if you don't want the wrap."}
{"text":"Really fresh ingredients, really tasty mix of deliciousness wrapped up in a pita. I've had their chicken shawarma three times and I love it so much. I've had their philly cheesecake and it is so good. I like everything about this place except for the price. I find their pita sandwiches to be on the pricey side at just under $6 for a regular and just under $9 for a large. I find that price is hard to justify for a sandwhich but then again, they are soooo good and healthy too!"}
{"text":"Really more like 4.5*
I do not give such high ratings often but this place totally rocks. Take my order quick, many things to customize your pita with, was not over priced, tasted REAL good AND was healthy. Their menu is really neat too, with many items and even manier (Is it a word?) customizations you can do.

I am sure as hell coming back for more. It just might be very well my new favorite quick food place It aint no fast food)

\"I like\"
\"Very nice\"

Eugene

Edit: Been there a bunch more times and its always good. Bumping up for consistency of goodness."}
{"text":"Simply put its like the Pita version of Chipotle. You choose the ingredients you want stuffed into your pita. I chose the Chicken Shawarma pre-chosen one where all the ingredients are ones they chose.  Not bad.  Pretty fresh ingredients. Not a whole lot of chicken though. I did like the paper they wrapped it in. It's perforated so that when you sit down to eat, you tear at the perforation which uncovers the top half of your pita so the bottom is still wrapped for you to hold onto while eating so it doesn't fall apart."}
{"text":"In case you were wondering what not so delicious airport Mediterranean food tastes like, here you will meet your match. Tried a falafel pita which was fair, the veggies and other assorted condiments come out of bags and sriracha is codename for Sriracha mayo (not sure why they don't write that on the board?). The food was edible but disappointing, but I guess my expectations should have been low since it is located at an airport, but I had my hopes up prior to eating it. The person in front of me went with a Philly and they pulled something strange looking out of the fridge and tossed it on the grill which I assume was some type of steak product."}
{"text":"I've become quite a fan of this place, I was never really a big pita fan however these guys have turned that around for me. Located conveniently close to Sherway Gardens and the highway with ample parking I find the location easy to get to and reasonably spacious inside. I rarely dine in but I find them clean, the space is bright and comfortable so if I had to I certainly would.

I do believe management has changed a few times since I started coming recently but I have always reviewed polite and prompt service. 

I enjoy the selection of wraps/pitas, flatbreads and Mediterranean dishes that are bursting with flavor. I used to adore one of their seasonal menu items, the sweet potato flatbread, that topped with blue cheese and cranberries. It is as light and crispy and whets consistently tasty.  The grilled goat cheese pita is a favorite from their main menu selections... I love the chipotle chicken too. They also have tasty pita chips with different flavors, I'm not sure but I believe they make them in house.

My favorite thing about this place is the pureblendz smoothies that come in an awesome array of tasty flavors.... My personal fav has been the immune boost but you'd better believe I'll be trying them all. Unlike booster juice I actually feel intrigued by all the flavors and they have a ton of green options which I love!!

The price is pretty reasonable and the portions are decent, the flatbread I find more of a personal size but it's ever so delicious and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I NEVER eat at Extreme Pita. After a bout of food poisoning many, many years ago...I have been so turned off by it. However, while visiting with my sister over the weekend we figured we should have a quick bite to eat before venturing out on our errands. We stopped in here as it was close by, and I was super impressed! We were greeted with friendly smiles. The place was SPOTLESS, including the bathroom, which I did use. We shared a veggie pita and it was really good, all of the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. The only downside was the really strong onion smell on my hands after washing them repeatedly! I am happy to say that I am no longer afraid of Extreme Pita =)"}
{"text":"The pitas are great! Chicken Shawarma and Gyro pitas are tasty. 

Though, the service is quite hit or miss. I think this hurts their business a bit, as it seems less busy than it used to be over the last few months. The owner seems nice, and hard working, but she cant be here every open hour. Employees are usually in the back, hidden from the front until the door chimes as someone enters. They go up front with a too lazed back attitude to greet the customers. Don't go within 30 minutes of closing.  You will mess up their quick exit they setup, and the attitude isn't pleasant.  

I think today was my last day here.  I'll miss the food,  but not the service."}
{"text":"First time there today. Stopped by before seeing a movie. I ordered the  Grilled Chicken 

 grilled chicken, tomato, cucumber, mushroom, romaine lettuce, red onion, green pepper and Tzatziki sauce.

I ordered an extra Tzatziki sauce, it needed it imo.
Wash delish:)"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Extreme Pita for a while, but rarely find myself in that part of town during lunch.  Finally gave it a try and really liked it!  My husband had the Caesar Pita and I had the Thai Chicken Pita.  I didn't try his, but he tried mine and loved it as much as I did.  The veggies were very good and the sauce was the perfect combination of sweet & spicy.  We both ordered the small size pita and it was more than enough food.  I also couldn't believe how low-cal it was!  My small Thai Chicken Pita was only 270 calories!   Very tasty and filling lunch for 270 calories!  I was impressed and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ballantyne Village more times than I would like to admit in the last 2 months...so after eating the same thing for lunch all the time...I decided to venture out and get some Yelping material! I found this pita joint online and rounded up a few business associates of mine to check it out. We got there around lunch time so it was busy...considering the size of the place. There was one table left and we sent off a table hawk to grab it. There were about 6 tables that could seat 4 and a few high table's to seat two and there wasn't any outdoor seating so if you have a large group...don't plan on eating in.

The menu was varied with traditional pitas like the gyro but the also had a teriyaki one and a mediterranean chicken one and some other interesting combinations...yum...I opted for the falafel, which is a vegeterian pita. (Not that I am vegeterian but the picture looked good). I got a small which is a good portion for lunch...I would hate to see what the large looked like. The pita person behind the counter asked me what toppings I wanted and I got lettuce, tomato and cucumber...then she asked me if I wanted hummus, hot sauce and that sauce that comes on gyros...t-something...just googled it...tzatziki. Anyway...I said no and she kinda looked at me funny...so I got it. 

The pita was okay...I think I bought it because the falafel looked liked mozzarella sticks on the picture but I should have gotten something else. I didn't like the texture...kinda like fried hummus and grits. 

I'll try something else next time...great value for the size of the pita. Check it out (with 4 or less friends)."}
{"text":"This restaurant does seem crowded with long lineups but I cannot figure out why.  I was in the area, so I popped in and chose the Chicken Shwarma.  I knew it would not really be like eating a real shwarma but I was hoping it would come close.  There was a strange spice to it, and it really did not taste that good, kind of bland really with the weird spice in undertones.  I gave them a second try, this time choosing the Philly cheesesteak.  It had a strange sauce choice for a Philly cheesesteak, a Chipotle sauce, the onions were raw and there was little to no cheese.  Neither pita had an appealing flavor at all, and both were much smaller than at similar restaurants for the same price.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a big fan of pita places but my coworker loves this place because it's healthy and they even show the calories on the menu. I went for the chicken shawarma and was not disappointed. It reminded me of a chicken pita I usually get at The Pita Jungle (although not as good). I though it was a little on the pricey side too. I think Pita Jungle is a tad cheaper for the same thing. I like that a lot of their pitas have meat in it that's cooked to order and it's not just a salad in a pita. Service is very friendly and the food comes out relatively quick. This is a great lunch place if you're looking for something quick and healthy. It beats Subway, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Had a disappointing beef pita wrap today at this location. I find the quality is different from store to store at Extreme Pita as other locations have always been at least 3 star if not a 4 star. Fortunately for me it is a little outside of my regular traffic patterns."}
{"text":"I hang out in this complex a lot (at Gold Bar) and finally broke down and ate here recently.  Here's my thoughts on the whole place.

Extreme Pita isn't bad.  It's just not great.  I mean, theres a decent menu, prices are okay, service is mediocre.  But, something about it feels like a subway with pitas.  I got the gyro pita, and it was fine, but it just isnt anything that I would crave/miss food wise.

Like Micheal C said, it has an overlit, generic fast food decor feeling to it.  I think he said it best in his review of this place, and pretty much covered how I feel about Extreme Pita.  Go Micheal C!"}
{"text":"Living nearby,  we frequent this location when we're not feeling like a sub,  which is fairly often. And this particular location has continually gone downhill since we started coming here. 

The service at this location is abysmally slow,  to the point where two service people can't hammer out a few pitas in less than 10 minutes. They always undertook the meat -  what's the point of putting it on the grill if its not going to be hot when I eat my sandwich? The girl currently serving us has hair that's halfway down her back - I know that because there's no hair net or hat in sight. Blegh. 

Pitas are always small here, smaller than you would expect for the amount you pay. They're stingy on the toppings and don't seem to know how to put a good pita together. 

If you can go to a pita pit or somewhere else, instead,  I suggest you do. This is a last resort on the healthier side of fast food for me,  will avoid unless my boyfriend insists,  like he is now."}
{"text":"Pros : Their shawarma sauce was delicious. 

Cons: Extremely stingy with their meat portions. $6 for a plain chicken and sauce *small* pita seems excessive. I got mine with no additional toppings, and it was the skinniest pita I'd ever seen. For that much, I can get a shawarma AND a drink at Osmow's - where the pita has 3x the meat!  

Would I go back? Most likley not. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe my eyes upon entering this Extreme Pita for the first time today.  I'd not hesitate to eat anything straight off of the counter in this place.  The entire food prep area was absolutely spotless and the whole room practically sparkled.  The restroom was also nice and clean.  Sigh.  Then to top it off, I had the most friendly, smiley service ever and a delicious chicken shawarma pita.  The tabouleh really made it.   

My lunch date actually won a year's worth of pita's from here and could attest to how great the service is.  If every establishment's environment and service could be this way, I'd likely go bankrupt because I'd never hesitate to eat anywhere."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast, healthy and tasty food head to Extreme Pita.  I always get the falafel pita and it's sooo good. You get to choose exactly what you want on it and they make it right in front of you. My friend always gets the chicken pita and she says it's really great too.  Definitely get the little meal deal that comes with the cookie. They are abnormally good here. Really. 
You'll end up spending $7-9 for the whole meal- drink included, but you can't really beat it if you want something fast and good."}
{"text":"Nice clean location that's not always too busy so you can get in and out pretty quick.  It's different than a pita pit brand - I find that it's less volume of veggies in each pita but a bit more meat - a different meat to veggie ratio than pita pit, depending on your taste needs at the moment. 

Service is friendly - both times I've been here seemed to have the owner manning the service.  

Would go back anytime for my healthy pita cravings."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Michael C, there's nothing extreme here.  The food was A-OK and better than McWendyKing's.  I did find the service and presentation fit the mold of other fast food joints and that's not a good thing.

One of the guys behind the counter was a persistent up-seller which quickly became annoying."}
{"text":"Extreme Pita is great for a quick bite to eat. It's not the most healthiest place but compared to the other offerings in this food court I would rather eat here. The prices are reasonable & service has always been good."}
{"text":"Friendly and conveniently located. Love the Grilled Chicken Pita! Never a bad lunch."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! I'm always looking for a lunch option that's not sit-down but isn't just a sandwich shop or fast-food joint. Extreme Pita definitely fills that void. First of all, the people working there were super-friendly and helpful. Second, the food we ordered was really good and satisfying! I ordered the Falafel Fanatic (pita filled with hummus, veggies, and hot sauce). My husband got the Gyro. I believe both sandwiches ran around $8 (including a drink and chips). The falafel was a little dry, but the flavor was right-on, and the hot sauce added the perfect kick to the milder falafel and hummus. The grilled veggies also tasted fresh. The meat in my husband's choice was also good-quality, and the pita was moist but not too doughy. As an added bonus, both pitas were huge - lots of value but also flavor for your lunch money. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, and good service.

Nothing too \"Extreme\" about Extreme Pita, except maybe the welcome alternative to a burger and fries.

It also has an over-lit, generic, fast-food decor which inhibits digestion."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place, and its a nice quick and healthy meal.

Granted, if you are looking for an authentic Mediterranean or Greek pita/gyro eatery, then this is not for you. This is a very Americanized pita place. I can probably best describe it as the \"Subway\" of pita shops. 

Personally, I think the choices are great. They have a lot of \"pre-made\" pitas that you can order from, but I tend to always order freestyle. So far I have enjoyed everything I have asked them to shove in that Greek burrito. (It ends up looking like a burrito in the end)

Their hummus is good, and I am not sure if they make their own pita chips in-house or they are shipped in, but they are very tasty as well. 

All in all, it is a great place to get a healthy tasty meal without costing too much."}
{"text":"There has only been one review of Extreme Pita in 2012 (I'm writing this at the end of July 2012).  For a place that's located right next to a major movie theater complex, that is a bit of a red flag.

I first visited Extreme Pita when they first opened and spent time talking to the owner, who was developing it as a new franchise idea.  I liked it a lot and came back a few times.  Since then it's been at least a couple of years.

I didn't ask (I'll get to that in a second) but I strongly suspect the place has a different owner now.  Pretty much everything has changed.  I can't fault the variety of the menu, and the prices seemed reasonable.

Why 3-stars?  I'm torn.  I wanted a Greek Gyros.  They no longer sell what most people would associate with a traditional Greek Gyros but rather a Gryos Wrap.  I was there on a Saturday night (huge crowds at the theater next door) and the place was empty.  Oh, oh, another red flag?

The only person working was very difficult to understand and looked a bit like he sleeps in the alley behind the store.  He asked me if I wanted some very weird stuff on my Gyros (as if he had never made one before).  I ordered the basics.  At that point he threw some frozen mystery meat on the griddle and cooked it a minute or two.  Scary.

My gramma had a word to describe how he made the sandwich ... hamhanded.  The pita tore but he continued stuffing things into it.  It wasn't a traditional thick pita but more like a split tortilla.  I had no idea how I was going to eat it.  When he threw the meat down it landed on the counter and had to be scooped back up into the pita.  The man was (and I'm being kind) very rough around the edges, and even less smooth on people skills.

I'm thinking \"Yelp this as zero stars\" ... until I saw and ate the finished product.  Somehow it came out as a pleasant looking wrap with VERY fresh ingredients. The only part of the food itself that was poor was the Gyros meat, which was bland and flavorless.  For the price I think it was a bargain (I could only eat half in one sitting).  So, a fair rating puts Extreme Pita between 1 and 5 stars, hence a 3.  I honestly think the sandwich maker scares off the teen-to-twentyish movie crowd, but he makes a decent sandwich."}
{"text":"While I live in N-CLT, whenever I am back in S-CLT and in need of a healthy and quick lunch I will head to Extreme Pita.  This review is based on two visits in one week.

Atmosphere - Crazy lunch crowd, Subway style ordering line, occasionally overwhelmed appearing owner, and nervous yet friendly staff

Food -On both of my visits, I had the Grilled Chicken which is one of their \"Freestyle Pitas\".  For the purpose of healthiness, I opted not to have my vegetables grilled or the pita covered in one of their many sauces.  I like that they have all these choices.  My meal(s) was completed w/ pita chips and an ice tea.  The chicken was good as it was not overly \"preserved tasting\" (i.e. it did not taste like ham from all the added sodium).  The vegetables were fresh and they even offer feta cheese as an option (the healthiest of the cheeses...IMHO).  The pita chips were decent.  The downside to the meal was the substitute sweetener. The only one available is Splenda for which I am not a fan.    

Service - Busy, short, but still friendly.  Note that at lunch time it can be so hectic that you will need to act quickly with your order.  

Overall - Extreme Pita is a healthy alternative to regular fast food and I prefer it over Pita Pit."}
{"text":"First time here and I was impressed. The long lunch line moved quickly and smoothly. I was able to decide on the small Thai Beef Pita which was yummy and filling. Love that they post the calories! Pretty good selection on veggies and it feels like an upgrade to the traditional Subway type lunch. 

Learning how to eat the second half of the Pita is another matter though. I suggest pushing up from the bottom of the wrapper instead of taking off the wrapper, it  can be messy with dressing dripping out."}
{"text":"One of the ladies that works here is extremely bossy and a bad listener. I said I wanted a \"build your own pita\" with the Philly meat and she automatically assumed I wanted a Philly cheese steak. Without asking me she made the pita even though I reiterated that i wanted to pick my own ingredients. She likes to bark order to her co-workers and you can see they don't get along.

Pita was sub-par and meat was luke warm. I'm hoping I don't get sick."}
{"text":"Great selection of pitas here. Service is quick, I arrived when they had a long line and they got through it pretty quick. My food was good. Tasteful, but a little heavy on the sauce. Great place to go for a quick lunch. Only thing stopping me from giving a 5th star is the staff are like robots. Although they greet you and thank you, it feels like a rehearsed line and not genuine."}
{"text":"It's like Subway for pita! They make this pita pockets and you get to fill them with so many choices. I chose a gyro pita and filled it with lettuce, tomato, black olives, tabbouleh, and feta. So delish!"}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE places for lunch. Food is always tasty and fresh. Service is consistently top notch. I love the grilled chicken!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I've never been to an Extreme Pita! Yesterday I had to pop by Best Buy on my commute home from work, but as soon as I got out, the bus had just left and it was super windy outside (which means I am constantly eating my hair..) I was looking for a food place in the plaza (I mean literally just walking around looking for shelter) when I saw this place! 

The employee who served me was super friendly and informative, and I ended up ordering the sriracha falafel pita wrap. The wait was less than 5 minutes, and even though I was sitting down, the guy actually brought it over to me, which was really nice. The wrap itself... was pretty good! I'll admit, it was spicier than I thought (granted I'm white as hell so that's probably why) but the falafel was good, and the combination of all the ingredients was pretty decent (there were a couple questionable things but it didn't throw off the whole taste or anything - plus, you can add or take away anything you want so that's kind of on me!) The place was also super spacious and clean, and both of the employees working were really friendly and sweet. I'd definitely come back here the next time I'm looking for a healthy meal!"}
{"text":"The food was really really good and the prices were very reasonable so a definite 2 thumbs up for me.  We had the Chicken Soulveka (?spelling), the Mandarin Chicken Salad, and the pita chips.  Everything tasted really fresh.  But the best thing was the Pita Pizza because our 7 year old and 5 year old both loved it.   The reason we gave them 5 stars was that the staff was really nice and made great suggestions.  The location is great because it's right next to Harkins Theatres; we just found out that they have a Dinner and a Movie promotion.  We'll definitely be back !  NOTE: I just read the 1 star comments and I believe that they are under new management so give them a try."}
{"text":"Thought I would stop in at this place since it is close to work, it's healthy, and it's clean. Looks like a converted subway with an actual grill. Fresh veggies and pita bread. I ordered the Hercules that has gyro meat inside of it with your regular things inside, but I'm picky and didn't get some veggies I don't like. The lady plops the meat on the grill to heat it up and I'm already disappointed. Gyro meat should never be grilled on a grill, ever. And they weigh it out so I knew it wasn't going to be enough meat, and it comes with double meat! My wrap was sad. But I blame myself. This place is just not for me. Was also disappointed they didn't have ice tea made. Looks like they are equipped for it but get lazy and don't make it. I won't be coming back, but I did like the atmosphere, the concept, and it is a genuine original good idea for an alternative to a sub shop. So it's definitely better for your body to eat here. Just not for me. If your mainly a meat eater and not much of a health nut, go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I am new to the Pita thing, but it came highly recommended by a coworker and decided to tag along. The place is in a shopping center next to a Subway, and it had a similar feel. I ordered a Philly cheese steak pita, and had it the way they normally make it. A pita bread is stuffed with meat, cheese, and veggies, and topped with a special sauce. It was hot, filling, inexpensive and I got a bag of chips and a soda to go with, for about $8 and change. I'll definitely go again when I get the urge. A good lunch stop, but I would not go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Even my 5 yr old hated it. Only went here because we were early for our movie that was next door.

This place is an abomination.  Folks, it's empty when you walk in FOR A REASON."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I wish there was more than 1 in NC. I dont understand how people complain about waiting 10 minutes for cooked to order food? Its not a fast food restaurant. Whenever I walk in and they are busy they work hard and have multiple pitas at a time on the grill. I've never been in there more than 10 minutes and I only go during lunch. My only complaint is that they arent very welcoming when you come in. I go so much now that the lady knows my order. But initially I had to stumble through the experience. They dont explain anything. They'll watch you walk in confused and stumble through the menu before they take the time to do that. Also, the salad isn't worth it. They give you this huge container of Lettuce and the smallest portion of meat and ONE small side of dressing. And you have to pay for cheese, and they give you literally a sprinkle for $1. Just stick to Pitas at this place"}
{"text":"love love love this place, lots of options for you to choose from, the flavor is amazing, and the price is decent. i highly recommend anything with the goat cheese, and/or falafel. great, quick, and friendly service by anyone Ive encountered here. super quick and easy service. the restaurant is very clean, and lots of parking"}
{"text":"dont believe the previous negative comments. 
much like the vaughan location i frequent, this franchise is amazing, small in size but huge in flavor and options. the food is always super fresh, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, the building is pretty much brand new, so its always been spotless when ive come here. service is great, helpful and friendly. i feel that the workers of this location really do the extra effort to go the extra mile to make sure youre food tastes great. lots of parking! 
best wraps on the west end"}
{"text":"This place should just be called \"Extreme Disappointment,\" or \"Extreme-ly Expensive for What you Get.\"

I ordered from this Extreme Pita on Uber Eats and ordered two regular pitas. They didn't have sides or drinks available, so I just ordered the pitas - \"$23? For 2 pitas with nothing else? Dang, these better be huge pitas,\" I thought (Mind you, this was before the delivery charge or tip).

Spoiler alert; they weren't huge.

I requested no onions or cucumbers on my pita and no jalepenos on my Husband's pita. The order came fairly quickly, so yay for that.

We got the pitas and they were about the size of a 6 inch sub from Subway. Wow, really? These cost $23? We started eating, and, of course, they didn't leave off any of the toppings I'd asked. I have an onion allergy, so my Husband and I had to switch.

The pitas were...ok. Mediocre. Not delicious, not satisfying, but filling. But honestly, I wouldn't ever order them again. The cost alone is enough to convince me, but the fact that they couldn't even be bothered to leave off the toppings I asked...yeah, that's all I needed to know.

Maybe I'll try another pita place next time, but I EXTREME-ly doubt it will be this one again."}
