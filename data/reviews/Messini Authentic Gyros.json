{"text":"My Greek friends told me about this place and is now my go-to Greek place in the city. 

Delicious food for really really reasonable price. Pretty cheap when you think about how much good food you get. We generally go with the platters and nothing is really a miss here. The Greek fries are also a fave here. 

Not as subtle and refined as Parthenon a few doors down (which is like the classier, more upscale and pricier version) but still great and for the price point, the best there is, and one of my favorite restos in the city."}

{"text":"TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS YOU WON'T REGRET IT!

I've been going to Messini's for the past 7 years with my family and friends and we've never had a bad experience with the food. The food is amazing and incredibly affordable it almost seems too good to be true. 

Regarding the service, at the beginning when we use to go the service was relatively fine. The past 3 years of service has gone from an 8/10 to a 1/10. Two weeks ago I received probably the worst customer service I have ever been given in a restaurant. We waited 40 minutes for a table for 3 (not as packed as it usually is, I've gotten a table faster when it's been fuller)  as the server came to our table I asked the waiter how's it going it seems pretty busy today, he responded with WHAT DO YOU WANT? In a very strong accent. With my mouth open beyond belief we told him our order. He came back to give us our food he dropped the plates and left. We wanted a refill & napkins but he didn't come back only to give us the bill that we had to stay an extra 20 minutes just to ask for it. As I looked for him in other tables a lady asked if her group of 5 could switch from the cramped tables they were in, into the booth in front of us and he said no. I gave him tip but he didn't deserve anything. 

*if you're going to dine in be prepared to receive very horrible service and long waiting time."}
{"text":"so i've been going to Messini for years and the last few times, it's been a DISASTER. literally inedible food. 

what they keep getting wrong: 
- the rice is disgusting. it just seems like it was defrosted, with no flavour and no spice. 
- the chicken had no taste - literally no taste whatsoever.
- the octopus was clearly not fresh and a horrible texture

honestly it hurts me to write this because i used to love Messini, but unless management changes their food and spices it up a little, there's no need to return here. it's not the same as it used to be."}
{"text":"I took my parents here for their first time. It was very busy but we were happy to wait for a table. Once we were seated; the menus were given, water was delivered and our orders were taken. After ordering, the food came out quickly, and the portions were really big. I ordered a mixed gyro and it was huge and very tasty - the chicken/pork were very flavorful just wasn't a big fan of the thick breaded pita, the Greek fries were amazingly loaded with feta and a MUST try! and the Cesar salad was crisp and very quenching. It was unbelievable, the whole meal was awesome and actually too much for me as the salad alone was almost a whole meal! In short: Great value for good amount and quality of food! Prices are very reasonable and I think very cheap."}
{"text":"Nicest waiters, it's always packed which to me is a great sign of a good greek place. It's hit and miss really when you go on the Danforth for greek food, some are great and some are not. Messini is delicious. The feta on the greek salad is the best I've ever had. You get tonnes of food for very cheap. They didn't rush us out despite there being a line up out the door almost. Plus the waiters aren't so hard on the eyes if you know what I mean ;)
We each had a full meal and one alcoholic drink and it was like $40. that's a great price for a fun dinner, good quality food and nice service!
I highly recommend and will be back :)"}
{"text":"I ate here on vacation in June 2012. Granted, the lines were long and Danforth was inundated by happy Greek-Canadians celebrating their Eurocup soccer win over Russia. I was wanting better Greek food than the decent ones made in the Washington, DC area and thankful that Toronto offered a whole panoply of Greek food.

The Greek Fries. Wow. Wow. Wow. Get it, or else Zeus will thunder down upon you. I also recommend the spanakopita. I've never tasted delicious spanakopita in my life! My friend also recommended the Greek salad, which was very satisfying.

My only lesson learned is not to order lamb gyro. Apparently gyro is supposed to be better as pork and not vice versa. But I trust you'll make a better choice as he did, because I totally was owned by the pork souvlaki. It's the closest thing to eternal bliss, or rather...Olympic glory."}
{"text":"Souvlaki was bland !
Deep fried calamari was too salty !
Roast potatoes were bland too!
Fries was .. omg .. How do I even begin to describe it?!

Never again. Save yourself and pick another Greek restaurant from the area. 

Sorry messini.. you messed up big time and we'll never come back."}
{"text":"Alright, so I have a confession to make... I've been coming here for a few years, on a regular basis.  What can I say about their gyros--legendary!  I think what sets Messinis apart from everyone else is their phenomenal value (you could never cook this for cheaper at home, or have the means to), and freshness of the food, due to their sheer volume of sales.

Line up to get in is the normal--at all hours of the day.  In fact, it is not unusual to see the line up spill to outside.  But there is a good reason for that, and it is the quality of their food.  You can choose from chicken, pork or lamb gyros--and the size is definitely supersize me.  I cannot finish one myself, although I am sure someone with a healthy appetite can.  Inside, you will find it stuffed and spilling out with shaved seasoned caramelized meat, tzatziki, tomatos, onions and fries.

Other things to try for sure:  greek fries, greek salad, souvlakis and seafood.  All very very yummy.  

The greek fries, are little round fries, topped off with feta cheese, olive oil and dried oregano.  Then it is put under a salamander, so everything crisps up at the top.  There are other choices of carb side dishes, like roast potatoes (pretty good) and rice, but definitely get the greek fries ($1 extra over regualar fries, but totally and utterly worth the upgrade).

The greek salad is more of the traditional style, and does not contain lettuce--you will chunky cuts of tomatos, cucumbers, onions, black olives, green peppers and dressing (seems to be citris, olive oil, oregano, and other spices).  In the summer, it is very refreshing.

Souvlakis usually take a litlte long to come out, because of the grill time.  You can have your choice of either chicken or pork.  They are about an inch and half thick, about a foot long and comes with a side of tzatziki.  You will find that it has nice charred taste outside, and moist meat inside.

As far as seafood goes, they grill shrimp skewers and calamari on their grill.  Size of the shrimp can vary depending on the day, but they are usually about medium size.  Dip both into their tzatziki--mmmmm!

The atmosphere is very casual, so there is no need to dress up.  Just come as you are.  They open late evenings on weekends, with a limited menu (to gyros on a pita, fries and salad), and attracts a lot of bar crowds.  You will always though, find the food very clean, and service is usually very friendly (although at times the staff is overwhelmed by the volume of customers).

I have taken many friends, family and guests to this restaurant, and everyone raves about it afterwards, regardless of their age, background or tastebuds.  Order smart (like combos, for two people), and you really do not need more than $10 per person."}
{"text":"Had a few draughts and felt like a gyros. I haven't been to Messini in ages, and thought it would hit the spot after a few craft beers. Dry gyros covered in paprika. All I could taste was paprika. The interior of the restaurant is worn down. Washroom was filthy . I walk by this place all the time and it is very busy. After eating there tonight, the only thing I can see that keeps it busy is the price. It's disappointing to see neglected washrooms anywhere, but in a place that is clearly making profits , it is s sign that management doesn't care. Feed the masses who are happy  cause it's cheap. If you're looking for good food in a sanitary environment, this is not it."}
{"text":"literally a bang for your bucks. 
I've been here few times with family and friends and the combination which came with salad, potato fries, and 2 main choices of pitas (feta cheese added on salad and fries with 1$ is a must try). Filled ourself with just bread and olive, fries and salad, our pitas coming just to be brought home, but seem they wouldn't taste the same the next day.
The service is friendly and fairly quick with that lining up during lunch time. The owner warmly smiled and sat people down. The server with blond hair is the last I want to be served, we were literally forgotten almost half hour in a quite quiet evening, she wandered back and forth without even giving us a word though seeing we sat there looking at her waiting. Generally I am satisfied and a tad sense of guilt with all we got for a 18 buck bill."}
{"text":"Definitely four stars! This place is awesome. 
While I was at centennial college around the corner, we would come eat here/take out all the time and it was always great! 
One thing I would recommend is asking for cutlery to go though, because we never did and we're always left eating salads and potatoes with our hands (it's okay if you're in college, right?)
Otherwise, it's good food, lots of it - and cheap! I strongly suggest the Greek fries and chicken souvlaki stick - yum!"}
{"text":"Really amazing place! Food is really affordable and came out fast. We tried the Greek fries ( absolute yum), spinach pie, chicken souvlaki and  deep fried calamari. 

The spinach pie was okay- it was a little bland for my taste. The chicken souvlakis were huge and they were pretty good. Their tatziki sauce is amazing and definitely made everything taste amazing. The deep fried calamari was terrible - really rubbery and didn't smell great. 

Overall - a good first time experience and pretty decent (not great) Greek food!"}
{"text":"Ok Messini...I like you. You make me happy. But you have some problems.

Pros.

1.Very tasty gyros. Good tzatziki. Good pita. And for the most part, good meat. In my opinion, the best gyro you can get in Toronto.

2. Feta fries are pretty great.

3. Cheap. Very cheap. For the quality and quantity, the price cannot be beat.

4. Awesome location in the heart of Toronto's Greek Town.

Cons.

1. Lamb can be very fatty. Tried it 3 times. First time was amazing, second time was so fatty and burnt that it was almost inedible, and the third time was decent. Always have been happy with the chicken. Pork can be a little dry, but it is still delicious.

2. Service is pretty awful. Slow and sometimes rude. One of the last times that I went, two cooks were having a full blown fight while cooking. (\"kitchen\" is right at the entrance and completely open for everyone to see). They were yelling at each other for probably 20 minutes. No manager or supervisor stopped them. The restaurant was PACKED too. One time, our server completely forgot about us. So if you're looking for great service, don't expect it here.

3. The rest of the food is just meh. Greek salad is a typical Toronto version. Very unauthentic. Grilled Calamari was good, but overly chewy. 

Overall, this is my favorite Greek casual restaurant in Toronto. I am Greek and from Montreal, so I have been VERY spoiled with incredible Greek food (at home and at restaurants). I think the Greek food in Toronto is pretty awful and so I was pleasantly surprised when I had Messini. I do think that it is better than Marathon Restaurant in Montreal. But besides the gyros, nothing else is even comparable to Montreal restaurants (Mythos, Milos, Tripolis, Elounda, Atomic...the list goes on).

Now that I am settled in Toronto, Messini's is my go to Greek Restaurant."}
{"text":"It was first time for me to try greek foods.
And I loved it!!! The withe greek sauce. That is magic sauce. And cheese and french fries.... Yam yammmm :) moderate price and lot's of amount of foods !! I had to packed up the left overs. It was a lot. I would recommend to other people!"}
{"text":"Very good!!!! I suggest the fried chese, the grilled calamaries ans the gyros. Only gyro meat. The lamb is very greasy. Also the greek salad is amaizing!!!"}
{"text":"You can't beat it for casual Greek food.  Fresh, excellent quality, good portions, reasonably priced.  And another major plus which is rare for Toronto and Ontario in general, is the lack of  gouging on the drinks - reasonably priced beer and wine!  Kudos Messini."}
{"text":"My first time there over the weekend. Quick service and really good food. They forgot part of our food but once we mentioned it, they brought it immediately."}
{"text":"I see a lot of complaints but I really don't get the issue. You are paying $8 for a meal. As far as gyros go this is one of the best places in Toronto and a great deal just don't expect the moon and the sun. If there's a line probably not worth the wait, why get upset?"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about their gyros and decided to give the place a try. Nothing special about the wraps other than the fact that they were filling. Enjoyed their home fries, pork souvlaki and calamari. Staff was accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious and affordable! I constantly find myself wanting more of their greek fries! However, out of the many times I've visited this place, the service has only been anywhere from lackluster to horrid! There is almost always a screw up with the orders. Some of our orders either come late or never come at all, yet those items still show up on the bill. I think the kitchen and the rest of the staff just need to organize themselves a little bit better. 
This place deserves a five-star rating for their food. However, I would have to give them a one-star rating for their service and that is purely because of the one and only server we've ever had that got everything right (or at least tried to make everything right)."}
{"text":"The gyros were YUM, and so was the grilled calamari!
Everything else on the menu was a little more on the expensive side besides the gyros. The portion for the gyros is huge and only costs about $5!

Our waitress was SO friendly, though our waiters were very quiet and seemed uninterested, but were nice after we paid and left, haha.

Will come again for their delicious gyros!"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. DO NOT EAT HERE. 47 minutes for take out and get it home and it was DISGUSTING.  Covered in oil, no tatziki, horrible service. Don't do it. It's the worst food in all of Toronto. I literally had to make dinner after bringing this home it was so bad."}
{"text":"Awful. Cheap greasy food. Service was slow on the two occasions I ate there. The salad was overly dressed. The potatoes over cooked. 

 There are far better places on Danforth."}
{"text":"This IS the place to eat on the danforth. We are pretty lucky to live so close to the danforth. Food here will never fail you, generous portions and lots of meat! We always get the lamb plate,c chicken plate, greek fries and the salad. 
We advice you not to bother going on weekends or friday nights, do take out :)"}
{"text":"Their gyros has been my favourite, which is why I went to the Taste of Danforth for two days for a pork gyros and for a chicken one:)))"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this spot for over a year now. A Greek friend of mine recommended this place because as she put it, it is the only place that serves 'authentic Gyros'. What's that you may ask? Gyros with fries in it!! You know this place is good when even a Greek person likes it!

There are a few things that I love about this place:
1. It is open late at night on weekends, so if you are looking for some fast food take out after a heavy night of partying, this is perfect! 
2. It is cheap! For around $5.00 you can get a Gyro pita sandwich, which is a pretty great deal if you compare it to other places. And it is filling! 
3. The staff are friendly and quick and the owner is very nice as well. He even gave us free salads few times because we visited his restaurant so frequently. 
4. The food is DELICIOUS!

My personal recommendations:
1. Greek fries are to die for and a must! 
2. My fave gyro in a pita would be the chicken, so much flavor and so crispy, and I find it has less fat than the lamb! What I love the most about the gyro is that they are not afraid to add some garlic, which adds a great deal of flavor I find!
3. I also enjoy the Greek salad."}
{"text":"Call ahead on Sundays to find out if they have run out of their great Calamari. At Messini On Danforth we ordered regular fries and we all received the round fried potatoes :/  Pork, chicken, shrimp were all covered with tasty herbs and perfect with their delicious garlicky tzatziki that was perfect, not salty and not watery. We liked the simple non-oily, non-vinegary, delicious side salad with shaved thin flecks of feta cheese, raw red onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, spices and three small olives. The surf and turf is perfect for variety and avoid the soggy rice side dish. The pita bread is great and quite filling. They do not take reservations at dinner so go early before 5:30 pm to avoid the lines. There is a public parking lot directly North across the street on Arundel Ave with mobilepay or find a meter spot on the Danforth. Skip the hot drinks because thmugs have brown ring stains which rub off with your finger."}
{"text":"After a lackluster experience several years ago, I gave Messini one last chance yesterday.
Tables and chairs were sticky and dirty, as were the floors and stairs to their dungeon-like restroom.
Ordered a Chicken Gyro Meat Plate, Greek Salad, Rice, Roasted Potatoes and Chicken Souvlaki.
Roasted potatoes were disgusting, Rice was nowhere near Greek...
Gyro meat was dry, cold and tasteless.
Salad was tiny and overpriced in my opinion, but tasted okay.
Saving grace of the entire meal was the chicken souvlaki which was delicious, tzatziki was good too.
If I could do it all over again, I would have gone somewhere else. If I had to order here again, I would only order the souvlaki."}
{"text":"Come here pretty frequently when I need my fix for authentic greek gyros. They never fail to displease with the price being extremely fair and the portion sizes being huge! Food is always fresh and my personal favourite is the lamb gyros in a pita with their waffle fries!! Just delicious. Definitely a recommendation for anyone who is in the area needing a good place to pig out on some quality food."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. The order the food came out was completely messed up and when we asked for the bill, the waitress screwed it up royally: 1) we never asked for split bills and 2) the bills made no sense (they were spilt incorrectly). We therefore asked to get one bill please and she kept insisting that she couldn't and that this is the only way she can process it. We all work in the service industry and know what it means to deliver what clients ask. In our case specifically, one individual works in the restaurant industry and knows exactly how it works. We unfortunately were treated with disrespect and while we used to come often, I doubt we will come again after this very unprofessional incident."}
{"text":"I went here with three other friends. The service we received was really bad. The first guy who took our order was ok, not descriptive, sort of out of it and very mellowed out. Then this other girl came to serve us. She was the main problem. Extremely rude and annoyed the whole time. After receiving the food, we had to ask her something about the menu as we were confused what was coming with the order. It was a normal question a person eating at a Resturant may ask the person serving. She walked away thinking I was done when I wasn't. I was very polite because I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt - may be she had a bad day or something - she was consistently rude. Horrible horrible service. Oh and the food ... very dry and below average. Horrible experience"}
{"text":"As I walked up to the restaurant door, I could hardly contain my excitement.

The first time I had a Messini's gyro was during the Taste of the Danforth, probably 3 years ago. The summer prior, we had gone to the Greek islands and our policy was that gyros were appropriate for breakfast, lunch AND dinner! Seriously we had at least 1 gyro a day, so I know what I like in a good gryo. In Greece, they stuff them with fries, fresh tomatoes and lots of sauce, in addition to the spit-cooked meat that's not dried out, but does have a few nice crunchy pieces.

When I saw that Messini's stuffed their gryos with french fries I knew it was going to be the most amazing gryo joint in Toronto. Now having visited this past weekend, I was still delighted! The gryo's are huge and if you buy it by itself it costs $4. The lunch gyro (same size, but you can get a side salad or fries and comes with a big pop) for $7. So affordable. Both the pork gryo and the chicken gyro were very good. We didn't get the dollar chips covered in feta, but it looked pretty amazing as well. 

The restaurant itself is fairly small, maybe a total of 10-12 tables. We came for a pre-dinner snack and the place, was busy enough, only a few empty tables. The washrooms are clean (woohoo!) and the wait-staff are friendly enough despite being pretty busy.

If you are at the Taste of the Danforth, get in the line-up, if you are on the Danforth just because, go in wait for a seat. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Always so good, always so busy! The prices are right too, I'm always full for $6-8. I've never tasted a better gyro wrap, with the unique addition of the french fries in the wrap that everyone loves to mention. It really is pretty cool.

Make sure you leave yourself a little buffer of time if you want to sit-in. I've never seen it not full or mostly full, and I've been at all different times of the day.

Staff can be a little bit curt when you first walk in, but who cares, they're just trying to get people seated and fed in a short time and small space. The atmosphere really is cozy - mostly because it's a pretty tiny restaurant. Be prepared to be squished in beside a table of people you don't know (don't worry, you can make new friends).

Some people might rate lower because of the staff's curtness and squishy setting. But let's be real....who cares? The food is unreal, and that's the whole reason I'm there!"}
{"text":"I was there last night for the first time. I ordered a lamb/beef dinner plate with pita. Salad was overloaded with feta and olive oil, but lacking pepper. Gyro was awful. The meat  tastes like it was boiled with plain water before put up to skewer. It has a vey dull taste and full of fat and cartilage. Half of my plate was garbage, and it is $20!!!! We finished eating and about the leave but one of the orders had not come and we wanted to cancel that, but the server said that we cannot. What on earth I cannot cancel an order if it was not on my table until I finished all other orders and still waiting for that one which was supposed to come much earlier. I will never go there again and I don't recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"The Soup Nazi of Messini Take-Out. 

I've been ordering take out by phone almost every week for over a couple of years. I call it in because I live approx 15 min drive away depending on traffic and we all know how challenging it can be to get parking on the Danforth and how aggressive the parking cops are with tickets. I placed my order at 3:33.

Today I ordered my regular and arrived behind someone who was just paying for her walk in order. When I paid right after her at 3:42, I was told my order was nearly ready, so I went and waited as usual. It looked like someone's order was ready, but not mine because I had several items and this was a lone meal in a paper bag.  Shortly after another customer came in, gave her take out order and came to wait. Both customers had got their orders and left - and the lone paper bag order was unclaimed.  I asked the awesome guy (whose name I don't know but he is friendly and treats people well) to check on my order and he told the line cook to complete it. 

At 3:58 my order was being put in the bag and the line cook went to put the paper bag in with the rest of my food. I explained that I wanted a fresh order, that the paper bag had be sitting there even before I paid (3:42). I was then yelled at by some guy whom I had never interacted with before that I was not allowed to place phone orders anymore because I asked for fresh food.  It had been sitting on the counter getting cold and soggy (mixed gyros) for at least the 16 mins that I was in the restaurant, by the time I get it home, it will be well over a half hour and likely cold and mushy. The other parts of the order were a greek salad and greek fries. 

I know it gets busy in there and I fully expect seated patrons to get served first, I understand that some walk in orders may be easier or quicker to fulfill. I have worked the service industry, I get it. As a customer (never mind frequent and longstanding) I am confused about why it's okay their staff to yell across the room to me that I'm no longer allowed to call for takeout and why I am being yelled at for having expectations of a complete fresh meal, not one that has been sitting out getting cold and soggy for a good 16min+.  Would they allow a dine-in customer's food to sit on the counter for over 15 mins before serving them? Why is it okay for takeout? As decent as the food is, the abuse isn't worth it. I think I'll be looking for another Greek place."}
{"text":"Excellent place.
Gyros are amazing
Mixed grill platter was good
Lamb chops were again superb

I want to try the Calamari next time

I go there almost every week now

Reasonably priced too"}
{"text":"I was looking since 2,5 years in Canada, for a good KEBAB, the one I used to eat in France, with lamb, onions, tomatoes, white sauce and french fries... ! 
I went to Messini with 2 friends, coming from France too and saying that this restaurant is the best place ever to eat Kebab as we used to have before. So we went there on wednesday night, the place was very calm, and the girls working there are very nice.. and sexy :) 
The food is very good and cheap !! I had a PITA lamb which is the equivalent of the kebab we can find in Europe. For only 15 $ (tax and tips included), I had, one lamb Pita, glasses of Coke and one plate of potatoes with feta sharing with my friend. 
This place is very cheap and the food is good. My first greek in Toronto. No regrets !"}
{"text":"This is one of those staple places you see on a travel TV show where some host asks the locals for the best late night spot int he city.

I've drove 15 km to get here for the last seven years and it has failed once in maybe 50 times. When friends come from out of town I take them here to get stuffed with tasty for $10 a head.

Biggest tip: Buy the combination plate for $15 then pay an extra $1 to make the fries Greek. It's massive and two people are required. This is coming from a 6 ft 200 lb athletic eating machine. Do it and then quietly give me a slow clap in appreciation."}
{"text":"Messini is your typical Greek Restaurant. The staff is awful, absolutely terrible. They think they are above everyone who isn't greek. The gyros are average, they taste good when your drunk but when sober, they aren't that special. It's small and very loud too. Honestly, theirs a place by the large fountain and the Tim Hortons, I believe it's called Alexanders, and they have much better and friendly staff, and equal, if not better Gyros. Or try Souvlike at Pape and Danforth."}
{"text":"I love eating at Messini! There is no place on the Danforth nor anywhere else in the city where you can find authentic Greek gyros, they make it just like it is in Greece.

Messini is a little restaurant tucked away on the Danforth and it's always loaded. The takeout line and the restaurant is always full, which shows you how much people love this place. The menu has a variety of delicious Greek food at such an inexpensive price and the portions are nice and big! Expect to be very stuffed, they do not skimp with anything, especially the feta cheese, it's piled on like crazy- the way I like it. If you love soft drinks with your meal you will love this place, they give you free refills!

The service is excellent and the people working there are kind. It's always great to be at Messini and I totally recommend this place. The only downfall about this place is that it has no desserts and it can get a tad bit uncomfortable with the amount of people in such a tiny place."}
{"text":"The lamb and pork gyros were okay but Really TOO greasy. In fact, there was more fat than meat in our gyros. Very bad quality of food. After dinner, I felt sick after eating so much fat in just a small gyros.
Also, the place is small and quite dirty. Definitely not a place you would go for a date or special occasion."}
{"text":"This was the worst gyro I ever ate In my entire lifetime!  Yes it was cheap and filling, but the quality was just.not.there.  We had the pork- chicken mixed gyro on a pita. The meat was dry and burned and not spiced, there was about a 1/2 teaspoon of tzatziki and the tomato onion thing was almost non-existent, which made for a very dry, bland sandwich.
I will never come back here again. If I want quality, I'll make my own gyro at home"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, and GREAT portions. Love the fries in the gyros. The steak is really good. The calamari is great too."}
{"text":"Despite having read many great reviews and seeing this as top rated on Blog TO, I wasn't overly impressed with this place. I had been previously and recall the gyros being to die for, but returning a few weeks ago after a few years I'm not sure what's changed. I had the gyro dinner to share for 2, the gyro was fairly good, however the potatoes were Overcooked and the Greek salad had almost a whole red onion chopped in it. I'd rate this experience mediocre"}
{"text":"The lamb gyro was fresh, mouth-watering and cheap ($9 with a drink and fries/salad/potatoes/rice), and the tzatziki was super creamy. My bf had the chicken gyro but it was not as good as the lamb. Staff was friendly and the bathroom was clean. 

Minus one star because the pita bread could be softer and warmer. 

Minus another star because it was SO understaffed on a Saturday around brunch time. The waitress forgot to bring the hot sauce that we asked for and it took her 15 mins to get the check. Not entirely her fault, but still has to minus one star."}
{"text":"I ordered their pork gyro pita with salad and a drink. Total of $7.45+tax.
 The portion was awesome! I shared with my husband and we were both stuffed. Food is tasty although they could've thrown in some more of that delicious sauce they use. It's a perfect lunch place and I'm definitely returning to try more."}
{"text":"I have a few friends that like this place so I've been here a few times. I am not a fan. 

As this is a gyro place, that is what I order. I have tried all the gyro and they all have one thing in common, the meat is always tasteless, it has absolutely no flavor, I have no idea why so many people like this place.

I am also not impressed with the tzatziki, again it lacks flavor.

If you want a great gyro, go to Zorbas and try their new lamb or chicken gyro, it is miles better."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place given its reputation in the city. Ordered a lamb gyro.  Portions were big and the ingredients were fresh but the lamb meat had a lot of inedible grizzle. I had to spit out more meat than I was able to eat.
I will go back and try something else next time because this place was nice and friendly and the service was fast and prices were good. I may have just had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I have been to Messini a number of times.  It stands out in my mind as a beacon on the Danforth...amongst the touristy and overpriced Greek food spots.

I almost always order a Combo with a friend. The Combo gets you 2 sandwiches, a salad, and fries.  I recommend chicken gyro sandwich, Greek salad (the type with no lettuce!) and Greek fries.  Greek fries come with feta baked on top...mmm...
The combo costs around $16.  So, two people can eat really delicious food - and be totally STUFFED - for about $20.  

The catch is that there is often a line-up to get a table.  You can also do take-out there, which is awesome, but the containers spill so be careful if you go that route. I would also warn against going here for a \"nice\" dinner.  This is the type of place you go after work, when you want your food to come quickly!  And that's exactly why I love it."}
{"text":"Amazing price, great food, cute area, what more can someone want?  I never truly appreciated how awesome this place was until I moved to San Francisco - and now finding good Greek food is like impossible!  Most places don't even use real meat!! :(

The gyro's are good any time - late night, lunch, or even dinner!  Also, the feta fries are amazzzzzzzzzing! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Greek salad was tasty.
Pork souvlaki was good.
Tzatziki and Pita was very good.
I'm giving this restaurant a 3'star because I ordered a Messini salad and it was tiny and consisted only of lettuce and balsamic."}
{"text":"My friend and I experienced a rude shock here yesterday. Before we even got a chance to sit down the illiterate and incompetent host with the earring completely stepped out of line. He was asking for a name for the waiting list and couldn't grasp my friend's name. Her name is Jackie... She started spelling it out for him but the Neanderthal did not follow. Seeing that \"Jackie\" was beyond his comprehension, I offered my name and started spelling it out (now aware of his.... intellectual shortcomings). As a result, I was yelled at and told that there is no time for name spelling and that I should just say my name.... That's what we tried in the first place, buddy... Unbelievably rude. The food was alright from previous dining experiences here but the fact that they keep such pigs employed here will ensure I won't return."}
{"text":"Superior Gyros!

Fit for a king !!! Divine,succulent, heavenly, nectarous, delectable.... out of this world!!!

I approve of this place!"}
{"text":"Holy #$%&! $5 for a gyro! The mixed gyro (chicken and pork) is really delicious and packed with meat! I've gotta try other things there, as it stands I've only had their gyro, several times mind you. Based on their gyro and the value I highly recommend. 

Funny story, my girlfriend was a little annoyed with the guy taking our order, she thought he was rude, I thought he was fine and I told her maybe you should know what you're going to order when you get to the counter instead of humming and hawing after you've been waiting in line for 3 minutes. She did not appreciate that I took his side, but you could tell waiting in line that the guy doesn't take any shit and expects you to know what you want. Sometimes you got to read the situation and go with the flow."}
{"text":"I would have given fours stars for the really delicious food but the service was definitely below average. 

We were seated for a long time before anyone came to take our order - we would have waited longer except we decided to grab a server from the next table. She gave a look like we were disturbing her day.

I had the grilled calamari starter and it was the best grilled calamari I've had in a very long time. Not too chewy, just the perfect texture. The garlic sauce was a nice complement to the calamari. 

I also had the vegetarian sandwich with fries. Delicious! Honestly a lot of food. I would have liked ketchup with my fries but after dropping the food and running away, we never saw another server for the duration of our meal. 

When the meal was over we sat with our cluttered table for a long time. The tables around us were cleared of people and dishes. Were we invisible? Again we finally had to grab someone to get us the bill. Next? Of course after the arrival of the bill no one again showed up to take payment. We were right in the middle of the restaurant, how could we be missed so often? So we get up and go to the cash directly. And we're again ignored. There were three of us, how could so many people ignore us so well. Finally paid and left, whew. 

I'd go back again for the food but it must have been an off day since others have applauded the service."}
{"text":"When I crave for Greek food this is my go to place.  I love how the portion size is amazingly big and food is always fresh.  I can tell they make their food from scratch even down to their tzaziki sauce.  

Recently I went again and was expecting to wait awhile before getting a seat but to my surprise they expanded the place. Wait time was much shorter than anticipated. That said a lot about their business :)

My go to meal is always their slovaki dinner and I always upgrade to their Greek fries.  It comes with salad and pita bread with kalamata spread.  That's one satisfying meal for me."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and haven't had a bad experience, although I have overindulged once or twice and felt like garbage afterwards.

The gyros and souvlaki are very tasty and very affordable, with some of the lowest prices on the Danforth. The Greek fries are a bit of a guilty pleasure.

I'm no authority on Greek food, but I have heard a couple of locals call Messini a \"fast food\" Greek joint. I don't know if the slight is due to the food, the decor and/or the fact that it's always so busy and other places are jealous. Regardless, I don't care: it's cheap and it's good.

One of my biggest gripes has been the cleanliness. It's not the cleanest place, but they recently shut down for a week for some repairs and it seems to have improved. Look, ma - no holes in the leather bench seats anymore! (Not in the booth that I was sitting in, anyway).

Plus, the pace of the restaurant is very quick and loud, with so many customers coming and going. That's a bit of a pain because sometimes you don't feel like you can sit and relax. You feel pressure to eat quickly and GTFO. So, if you're looking for a relaxed, sit-down meal with a significant other or whoever, Messini may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent patron of Messini's for roughly 8 years now and following my experience tonight will never be going there again.  The service has gotten so poor unless you are ordering take out it is a disastrous dine in experience.  The staff on the floor is extremely incompetent and they completely neglect the guests on the \"new\" expansion side.  Me and some friends sat, ordered and waited 45 minutes before HALF of our order had come to our table, even after we had inquired why it was taking us so long.  The fascinating part is that the service staff actually seems conscious of the fact that they are providing terrible service yet seem so unable to overcome the barriers of actually being half decent at their work (although I will acknowledge that waiting tables in general is not easy work).  

We decided to get up, speak to the owner face to face and request to have our food taken out.  Surrounding guests who had come far after we were seated got their food before ours (if you can even say we actually \"got\" our food).  However, it was rewarding to inform the proprietor of how great his service was when we didn't even get our \"complimentary\" pita bread, an excellent sign of loyalty to a consumer!  And what was the cause of our meal fiasco?  They somehow in this day and age of technology, advancement and growth...could not....somehow...process an appetizer that we had ordered! (I suppose it's kind of like the butterfly effect where one single Gyro Pizza order had a catastrophic effect...makes sense).  I would formally like thank the staff for giving us two of our gyros free of charge, what a great display of gratitude amidst all this, I would have rather had them tell us to eff off to be honest.

Ultimately, this review means nothing, the food is obviously good and the prices are excellent, however what I experienced tonight is nothing either a long time or first time customer should experience.  The party beside us actually walked out and left before without getting their food, we should have known.  People will still continue to go as it is a very popular place but I'll never step foot in that place again."}
{"text":"This is like my GO TO place for Greek food.

Look around you.  The Danforth is packed with Greek restaurants after Greek restauranst.  But do you know who is always the busiest?  Messini's, that is who.  Nobody in the entire district is busier.  In fact, I sometimes think the surrounding restaurants just feed off of the people that do not wait in line for Messini's.  Your balls shrivel up when forced to wait out in the cold... and who wants that? 

Let's start the discussion with their gyros.  Massive is an understatement.  So massive is the girth, watching girls trying to force this down their throats is a sight to behold.  But at Messini's, it is not just about the size.  No sir, it is about quality and flavours, and their gyros have both.

Be sure to grab some Greek fries too.  I don't know if Greeks in Greece actually eat this for real or not, but even if they didn't, this would be one of those bastardized masterpieces.  They are coin shaped potato fries finished with olive oil, oregano and tons of feta layered on top.  Then it spends a couple quality minutes under a salamander oven and comes out all golden delicious.  

Lastly, I would normally not waste my time to write about a salad, but their Greek salad is probably the best in the entire world.  Sorry, no lettuce fillers here; just tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, bell peppers, feta and dressing.  Oooh and what dressing.  Home made done right.

Oh yeah, word of advice.  During the winters, do not be seated by the front windows.  Not only does the cold draft sneak in through the folding windows themselves, but also from all the oblivious melonheads holding the door wide open during middle of a blizzard.  This forces you to dine with your jacket on... or suffer with shrivelled balls (or rock hard nipples, depending on your gender)."}
{"text":"Came here a second time for dinner. 

For 2 people we shared
-Double chicken pita plate
-upgraded the fries from the dinner plate to greek fries
-the \"side salad\" from the dinner plate was a big BOWL!
-complimentary pita with olive spread

To sum it up, best 18 bucks spent, we both left full, and had enough for leftovers!"}
{"text":"Yes, people flock to this place cause it's cheap, but that doesn't mean it's good quality.
First, to start off, there is nothing authentic Greek about this place. Authentic Greek service is very friendly and polite. Not here - except the couple of young servers, the whole bunch of people are unimaginably rude - even the guy that cuts your Gyros. Which is where we come next. Only resembles the genuine gyros (I've visited Greece more than 50 times and ate lots of food in most parts of the country). The pork meat is very dry and chewy, while the lamb gyros is greasy. We can discuss if the fries are \"genuine\" part of the wrap, but actually that's perhaps the only thing I like (saw this practice in many northern parts of Greece). Souvlaki for some reason they always warn you that it will take at least 20 minutes, so I don't know anyone who tried it here. Weird tactics to demotivate you to order it. Probably because you should order the cheap low quality greasy wrap.
Salad is oily and very cheap tomatoes - no flavor. Pops are watered down from a fountain. What you pay is what you get. Actually, for Greek fast food I prefer the place next door!"}
{"text":"Meh... Not a huge fan.  I love a good Chicken Souvlaki dinner, but I would normally choose other options on the Danforth.  We ended up at Messini because it was a friend's choice.  

I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki Pita plate, thinking it came with potatoes and salad like at other Greek places nearby.   However, the potatoes came as an appetizer, and the salad never arrived.  The pita had french fries in it, which I thought was odd.  I didn't mind the first few bites with the fries, but then towards the middle/bottom of the pita, the fries were soggier and didn't do it for me, so I pulled most of them out.   The food was fine, but not memorable.  

The restaurant itself is lacking in atmosphere and felt very fast food-ish.   The dishes were old and scratched and dull-looking.

I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"After lining up for an hour at last year's Taste of Danforth, I have been wanting to go back to this restaurant for quite awhile. Luckily, JW finally had the time to bring me there (& courage since he does not like warps, shawarma,sandwiches etc.)! I was super super super excited when I saw these meats being slowly cooked right after entering the restaurant.


For appetizer, we ordered grilled calamari. The portion was actually almost two times bigger than what is shown in the picture. But we forgot to take a picture until we were half way through! The calamari was very juicy and tasty. Most importantly, it was not TOO chewy which I am always scared to find when eating calamari. Messini's calarmi was tendered with a little chewiness. However, I think it was a little too oily to the extent that it almost looked like its fried instead of grilled.


& of course I would order lamb gyros pita. Messini is famous for its gyros topped with its signature tzatziki sauce and french fries which is not very common in other gyros.  I was very excited when I reunited with the gyro that I had been craving for for awhile and shocked at the same time because it was huge. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. The lamb in the gyro had an interesting combination of lamb fat, some really tendered lamb and some that were rather hard. Although they were juicy and had a strong taste of lamb, I expected the meat to be extra tendered and not what I found this time. The portion was too huge that the french fries became too soggy and a burden half way through that I had to take them out. The tzatziki did an amazing job of adding a hint of freshness so the gyro was not crazy-heavy. This gyro was acceptable but nothing like I had at Taste of Danforth.


JW ordered the mixed gyro pita which came with pork and chicken as well as tzatziki and french fries. The pork was very very dry while the chicken was reasonably tendered. Overall, it tasted exactly like the lamb gyro pita except for the meat. The portion was very big that even JW found the gyro to be rather overwhelming.


conclusion:

not roasted.

I am sad to say I was rather disappointed. The gyro I had did not match up with what I expected. I will probably not come back again. I think its because the demand was so high at Taste of Danforth that the turnover of the meat was much faster so the meat was not overcooked and a lot more tendered. I highly recommend one to share the gyro with another person because the portion was very big as I mentioned a few times.

{"text":"Went here last night with my boyfriend and we were seated after about 5 minutes of waiting and nobody acknowledging our existence. Once we were acknowledged they sat us at the very back corner of the restaurant where the back emergency exit was. Very cold and dirty and run down. Tables look like theyve never been changed since restaurant opened up. The wood work in the restaurant is very old and dirty looking (not a nice rustic look but nasty). Also there was gum stuck on the wood beside my seat which has always grossed me out. Washrooms downstairs have graffiti all over and also not well kept. For being \"one of the best\" on danforth, i wouldnt want to see any of the others. Anyways we ordered a gyro pizza, greek salad, calamari and chicken gyro pita in a specific order. We wanted our calamari first although it ended up coming last! Greek salad which i ordered for myself and wabted it last, came first. Waitress could hardly speak english which made matters worse. Quality of food was not greatest, sadly the best thing was the greek salad. Do not order the calamari here, it is very chewy and for about 12 dollars i would expect more than 8 rings of calamari, half of the plate was greens. Since when does a salad come as half the plate when ordering calamari. Than in the corner were two baby squids whole! Which again i did not expect and was not noted on menu. Iced teas were warm! Before leaving we aaked the waitress for a to go container, she replied okayvsure one minute and went to go get her jacket to go home and never returned. Overall bad experience! Will not return and would not recommend! Sucks because i was excited to go here!"}
{"text":"Awful. Absolutely awful.

Went here with some friends, as we had a hankering for some greek food. Was a complete letdown. I ordered the chicken gyros plate. Chicken was like eating plastic, as I must have gotten the shavings that had been left on the griddle. Rice was bland and wayyyyyy over-cooked. I had the Messini Salad, which wasn't awful, but was $2-salad-bar quality ingredients.

All the dishware and cutlery was smudgey. Customer service was incredibly slow, though they at least were courteous and (as far as I remember) didn't forget/mis-order anything. I will give them the benefit of the doubt on their service speed, as it was completely full in the restaurant.

Overall, it felt like I was eating at an under-funded grade-school cafeteria. There is way better on the danforth."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've ever had. We go there at least once a week. Getting the two pita combination dinner is the best way to go to save money."}
{"text":"Stopped by here last night with a friend. I got the lamb dinner plate which included circular french fries, a generous portion of chopped lamb, and some onions to top it off. On the side a salad was included with the meal, consisting of fresh cucumbers, tomatoes, olives and feta cheese. Overall delicious meal, but I only treat myself to \"junk food\" once a week, so my taste buds aren't too picky. Service is meh, similar to a popular fast food place. Overall, the dinner cost me around $18.00 which isn't bad at all for what I was getting."}
{"text":"Yummy gyros, great greek fries, and the best yummy fresh greek salad, it's always crowded and the service is slow but the taste worths the wait"}
{"text":"A staple of the Danforth, Messini's is a classic stop to grab some filling Greek food and not break the bank. With the large portions, mouth-watering selection of meats and the focused and simplistic menu selections I highly recommend this venue to anyone wanting to try out a Gyro for the first time, tenth time, or hundredth.

Messini's has a vibrant atmosphere and is constantly buzzing, particularly through the dinner and later evening hours. Whether you want to venture out for lunch or to grab a quick late night snack this is the venue to frequent.

Unfortunately there is still major room for improvement with the waitstaff in that they're typically 1st generation immigrants and have difficulty understanding general questions and inquiries. Further to my point, being that the majority of staff do not originate from North America, there is the sense that they aren't paying attention to customers and have a bland, rude and \"dry\" look to their face when you interact with them; I doubt that this will be addressed given the popularity of the place though.

For those not inclined to deal with the bland customer service vibe I recommend getting take-out, albeit you'll miss out on the experience and a couple of dine-in exclusives (i.e.: Dine for 2 on the backpage is extremely cost effective). Any way you slice it though Messini's is a definite must for anyone in the mood for Greek food."}
{"text":"this is the best greek food on the danforth great portions and great peice"}
{"text":"I LOVE greek food. My friend had been raving about this place for weeks after \"discovering\" it and we finally gave it a shot today. Despite having been hyped up, the gyros at Messini did not disappoint. 

The greek fries (with feta cheese) were cheap, but weren't as amazing as I expected them to be, but the Gyros were delicious, filling, and very reasonably priced. My bill for the pork and chicken Gyro came to just a little over $5 after tax & tip. For a cheap eat, the restaurant was nice and clean, and the food didn't leave me with that nasty greasy feeling! Yay! 

I also hear this place is open pretty late. I would definitely recommend this place, and come back here myself! Yummmm!

Update: the gyros were soo good I was actually craving one all day today."}
{"text":"If you've been to Taste of Danforth, you already know that Messini's will always have the longest line! I come here after work sometimes for Chicken Gyro Pitas and it's so good especially since they have the fries in the gyro. Price is great too for only 5.50 and they've expanded the restaurant space so there's plenty of seating. The only bad thing about this place is that I feel that the service could be faster but nonetheless it's a great place to be especially as a student/on a budget"}
{"text":"I heard they service the best gyros and fries in Toronto, tried and indeed that's true.  I'm on a business trip in Toronto, tried a few places, love Messini the most.

The veg items are all very tasty as well as fresh, the portions are generously sized and prices are good.  The only downside is long queues outdoors and a definite wait, but the quality and taste of food compensates for it."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 friends for an afternoon.

The food:
It was my first time with Greek food so I was pleasantly surprised. There were a lot of olive stuff. I hate olives so I had a hard time. The gyro wraps was very filling and unique. I had the lamb one. I wish the meat was more tender than what I had. But it was still good. The Greek fries and salads were ok. My friends liked them but I didn't enjoy them as much.

The service: 
The server was friendly and the food arrived fast. Not much complaints here.

The environment:
Space is relatively big though we visited at odd hours so not many people were there. Place is really clean. But their indoor decor could do better or maybe I'm too picky.

Lovely experience for the first time. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Introduced by my girlfriend, and must say she chooses very well!

The location is easy to remember as it is at the beginning of greektown.

Onto the main course, I have had both the dine in option and take out option. Both have their merits as the service is great and the food is easy to carry around. 

The dining area is comfortable and has a very warm feeling to it. The service is very polite and effective.
The take out is quick from the ordering to the completion of cooking. Food quality is great and by far is the best gyro I have had in toronto!

Rating: 5 Stars


The only negative thing about messini is the lack of stomach space after = no room for seconds!!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best casual dining spot on the Danforth. 

Ordered a couple of gyros, which were good, the chicken was dry however, the fries are a fast food staple and are a nice inclusion in the gyros. 

Also had the saganaki which was served without lemon (inexcusable) and was sort of cold, why not light it on fire and douse it with lemon like everyone else?

The tirokafteri was good, though they give you one pita for a fairly decent chunk of spread, get with it and don't cheap out on the pita! It was annoying asking the server for order after order of pita. 

Ended the meal with an order of tiropita (cheese pie) which was excellent, almost as good as grandma makes it! This redeemed the meal although I'm unsure if it is made on site (unlikely) or they just reheat on order. Either way it is excellent.

Service speed and friendliness was excellent, and an excellent value for your money.

A good spot that is easy on the wallet and not as formal (or good) as Mezes."}
{"text":"I come here every year on my birthday with my boyfriend. We order a bottle of wine, and three or four dishes to pig out on. The food is fresh, you can tell they only use the best ingredients and its filling. It's as close as I'll get to authentic Greek as when I was visiting Greece. I LOVE the feta fries and the gyro dinner. The atmosphere is always nice, great ambience, service is always swift and the staff are incredibly nice and accomodating. Tip; make sure to make reservations if you have plans to dine on the weekend. Wait times range from 30 to 40 mins."}
{"text":"Doesn't deserve to be called authentic.

Beef/lamb gyros were very oily and the meat was dry. This place does not deserve to be called authentic. The meat in my gyro was not even sliced from the traditional meat stack; they were cooked on skewers. When I got near the bottom on my gyro, the pieces were so burnt that it was inedible.

AVOID this place. After reading other reviews of what this place has become, I would even try an empty nearby Greek restaurant on the Danforth than to step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"On a weekday evening, this place was popular and filled with customers.  When leaving, there was a lineup to the door.  Luckily I arrived just before the dinner crowd and was ushered to an open table.  Plus 1 for the Greek salad, minus 2 for the pork gyro as the fillings lacked flavour and the pita was dry.  It took a while to get the attention of our waiter to pay the bill.  To enhance my experience there could have been more servers on the floor as it seemed the waiter to customer ratio was unequal."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? Probably not much, so I'll just emphasize how good it is~ My first Messini experience was a few years ago when my Greek friend took me, and I've been back way too many times since. I knew it was love from the start... 

I'd never seen fries stuffed in a pita before, but I sure as hell wasn't complaining about it. That the platter came with more fries was it for me. I used to go to other places along the Danforth to get my Greek fix on but Messini's has become my go-to place and it's always good. I go there so often that the owner now greets me and shakes my hand when he sees me--I admit it, I'm a Messini's slut! No shame there...

There is nothing to complain about with this place, except that I've shown up before only to find it closed, though that's understandable since it's been really late those times. Apart from that, I once ordered (actually I ALWAYS order..) the pork souvlaki on pita and ended up with a gyro instead. I was too hungry to complain but I wasn't loving it and it really wasn't the end of the world as my love for Messini's, I have learned, is unconditional. I noticed everyone here was raving about their gyros and I've had both the pork and the chicken off the spit; neither does it for me. 

I usually stick to the pork souvlaki pita dinner combo. It's a 15-20-minute wait for souvlaki but it's well worth it and the amount of food is as much as I can handle in one sitting. (I get scared when I go with people who want to order apps cos that's A LOT of food. The fried calamari is really good, in case you were wondering, and not the kind that comes frozen in a bag.) During the \"wait\", you get warm pita with the olive tapenade, and then comes the super-huge, super-fresh Greek salad that is covered in soft, crumbled feta and oregano, drizzled in olive oil...sweet Jesus...and those alone are enough to take one's mind off the wait. Pitas are served with your choice of potato. I usually get the fries (the roasted lemony potatoes are OK but not if you mean business) but tend not to upgrade them anymore as I find the feta dry from baking?, but that's just me. I have also ordered the non-pita platters before but the tzatziki (in the pita) is what keeps the meat moist, even after it's cooled down.

I always leave there feeling like an animal, but with nary a regret. I am ALWAYS satisfied with my meal (except when they serve me a gyro instead of souvlaki) and everyone I have ever brought here has LOVED it. It's dirt-cheap, service is as it should be, and the food is SO DELICIOUS! It's the closest thing I have come to the souvlaki one gets in Montreal's many Greek-owned greasy spoons. And I like how they go through the trouble of frying up two different types of french fries. 

James V. mentioned something about hard nipples? He's so right. And don't let the lineup deter you, it goes pretty fast."}
{"text":"Amazing food, price, and service.  The best Gyros you ever eat in Toronto.  My wife and I eats every Saturday there."}
{"text":"The best Gyro in the city, hands down. Me and my girlfriend go there often and always order the Double Chicken Gyro which comes with a Greek salad and feta fries. Food is very reasonably priced, and they have cheap beers as well. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! The food is the most delicious I've tried in Toronto and the portions are HUGE!!  Me and my bf generally eat A LOT but were having trouble finishing all the food! We got 2 gyro (lamb and chicken- sooooo delicious) and we had a large salad with a crazy amount of feta, and feta fries (must order
These) we also had an appetizer and my bf had a beer, it came it less than $25!!!!!!!' 
Incredible place.
A must try!"}
{"text":"Be warned if you order something like soulvaki it will take a bit longer since it is cooked fresh off the grill.  This place always has a line during the Taste of the Danforth festival.  Here they serve their gyros stuffed with fries (optional).  I came here for dinner - very busy.  Server was not very attentive during my visit.  Chicken soulvaki was a-okay.  My friend had the skewered shrimp."}
{"text":"Great food, large serving size, good prices, and quick service.

Everything was great, we got the open faced gyro and and a chicken gyro wrap with greek salad and roasted potatoes and fries.  Great greek salad - definitely do not spare on the feta which is great!!"}
{"text":"Open since 2002 after a test run at Toronto's famed Taste of the Danforth festival, Messini has paid its dues and become a mainstay for the after-work and after-bar crowd in the east end.  Located just east of Chester station this cozy, diner-like hotspot serves up comfort classics like gyros and souvlaki with a pleasant touch of back-home authenticity.
 
Making the most of a rare trip to the Danforth my companion and I sampled widely from the menu, ordering a stack of appetizers, a sandwich and a grill plate.  A great idea had I shown the good sense to skip the late lunch I had consumed just a few hours prior.
 
We decided to take the food as it came, with cold beers to keep us company between arrivals.  First up was the Saganaki ($7.95), a generous wedge of fried cheese served with pita (fresh-made daily).  Dense, firm, crispy and salty, it was more than enough to keep two of us happy and looking forward to the rest of the meal.
 
Next to arrive were the Kalamaki ($1.75 each), skewers of cubed pork, char-grilled and served with tzatziki.  The meat was juicy and well-seasoned, with the dip offering a cool, refreshing hit against the savoury meat.  At this price I won't pass by again without stopping in for one (or three).  
 
We rounded out the starters with Greek Fries ($3.95).  Ripple-cut potatoes lined a banquet plate, topped with a vast expanse of feta, olive oil and oregano.  We guiltily indulged in this rich, dense creation, barely pausing for words between mouthfuls.
 
My friend valiantly challenged the Mixed Grill Plate ($13.95), a tower of shaved gyros, pork souvlaki, Greek-style sausage and a meat kebab (lamb and beef).  Already subdued by the appetizers, he struggled to finish and eventually relegated the remainder of his plate to the next day's lunch, having thoroughly enjoyed every bite he could muster.
 
I turned my attention to what Messini claims is Toronto's best-tasting gyro ($4.58 for the sandwich).  It's stuffed with French fries, the way you'd find it at a fast-food stand in many a Greek metropolis.  Strangely, it was the only disappointment of the evening; while the pita was fluffy ad flavourful, the sandwich was a bit on the dry side and the fries made little contribution beyond adding some novelty.  A bit more tzatziki would have done the trick - be sure to ask for extra.
 
Greek cuisine is inherently meat-intensive, and I for one am OK with that.  There are a few vegetarian options on the menu, but vegans will be hard-pressed to put a meal together.  It's not exactly fine dining, but the food at Messini will leave even the most devout carnivore satisfied at any hour (they're open until 4AM on weekends!) and the value is rarely matched."}
{"text":"I have been going to Messini since I was 15 years old so it's been over 10 years! This has always been my go-to! The manager Marinos is such a great guy! Just get off at chester station and it's right there, very convenient!"}
{"text":"I LOOOVE Messinis! However the new one that opened up at Yonge and Eg doesn't compete with the Danforth location. I noticed a significant difference with their greek salad."}
{"text":"This is not a review of the restaurant and its items and service in full over a long period of time and different tryouts, no, this is a review for one thing and one thing only: Pork gyro.

Well, pork and chicken gyros, really. This place is my go-to joint for a pork gyro, I don't usually get the chicken gyro but I'm including it in this review because both cost the same. And this is the Danforth, we're lucky to get pretty much the best type of gyros in the city, and pretty much all places do them the same. However, Messini is my reference here, because it's just as good, and much, much cheaper than anywhere else!

A pork/chicken gyro at other places might cost you less than 10, probably 9 dollars. A pork/chicken gyro here will cost you 5.50. That's it. Saved you 4 bucks! Same quality, very good service, I like the work that the front staff is doing for takeout and fast orders, they are well organized and I'm with them when it comes to serving good food properly to customers under the hot lights, meat turners and ovens, so good job to them and I hope they keep it up, I appreciate the work they put in.

The real convenience of the price, the quality of the food and the organization and good work of the cooking staff as a whole makes it MY go-to location for a gyro to go, when it's not too crowded. I generally don't like tzatziki in sandwiches/wraps, so I get my gyros with ketchup and mayonnaise, the european/middle eastern way. Because, by now, I think everyone should have tried meat and/or fries with ketchup-mayo at least once in their lifetime."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious gyros. If you get the dinner it comes with greek salad, greek fries (the best in Toronto in my opinion), pita and dip.

Overall this is THE place to go to when I would like some yummy greek gyros.

I never had an issue with the service. Despite there always being line ups at the door, I have not waited for a table for more than 15 minutes, even on busy Saturday evenings.
The food is served really fast and the service is great."}
{"text":"BEST greek food ever! The ambience of this place is great! Awesome prices and the portion sizes are HUGE! Also, amazing customer service! All their main items come with a greek salad with a generous amount of feta cheese..mmm.. as well as their bread with olive spread!"}
{"text":"It was a bad experience. I go to Messini for about  11 years now travelling from Woodbridge.
Three weeks ago my wife and I took some guests to Messini for dinner.

 It was a really bad experience as the waitress was such a rude and arrogant person. that was the girl with tatoe on her arm in case you end up getting her in your visit. 
 on top of that service was slow, order and turns mixed up, food very mediocre and not like as always.
 the man who lines up customers for table was outright yelling at the customers.
 owner was working hard sweating in the kitchen.
 we were seated in the new expanded area where it is a blind spot to the owner line of sight. staff had gathered there near our table telling jokes and laughing out load as we were waiting for our food.

 expansion is great but Messsini requires trained and professional staff. and also needs to bring their food quality back to Messini level."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service!  Rude, slow and the quality of the meat has gone downhill big time in the past year!

I've been coming here for 12 years and used to love this place.  However the crappy food or late along with the careless staff and ATROCIOUS service will not bring me back ever again.  

Their manager can barely speak English and does not care about his customers.  The cooks are extremelely rude and unhygenic (I saw them pick up meat with their hands off the floor and put it back in the pile).  

Absolutely disgusting place that should be avoided.  Went to the place next door and even though the woman was kind of weird, I got a much tastier and filling gyro for the same price with SUPERIOR service.  These people need to get shut down by the health inspectors immediately.  

And to top it all off they were extremely rude about giving me a refund despite their health violations and having made us wait 20 minutes for our order.  

Such a shame to see this place go downhill so fast.  Sad. 

You may ask, why 2 stars then?  The only reason is due to the great sentimental  memories I've had there in the past.  Does not even deserve 1 star right now.

Gross, should be avoided."}
{"text":"I love Messini. There's a reason there are always long lines out the door during meal times and later in the evening. I tend to go for lunch, in the mid afternoon, or just before dinner time to avoid the lines.

I wouldn't necessarily recommend their other platter/meal dishes - there are plenty of other good restaurants nearby for that. 

But don't miss the gyros!!! They are superb -  fresh, delicious, and among the cheapest on the Danforth. The meat is the real deal - During Taste of the Danforth, we were looking at various roasting pits the restaurants put out, and saw that at some places the meat just looks like a block of completely smooth, plastic-fake thing. At Messini, they're literally large hunks of meat stacked on top of each other, and you can taste the difference.

If you're in need of a quick, affordable, tasty meal to meet friends over (or take home to enjoy alone), this is a great option."}
{"text":"Messini used to be great. We used to go at least a couple times a month but it's been about a year
Since we last ate there.  We both got the pork gyro pita. The whole thing was bland. It literally tastes like nothing. How can the meat taste like nothing?!?  The quality and service has seriously declined. As a Greek, I'm embarrassed that they are serving this crap and calling it gyro.

If I could, I would have given it 0 stars."}
{"text":"This is located right in the heart of the Danforth, Greek town. The worst part about this location is the parking. It's hard to find street parking on a busy day. However if and when you do.. it's worth it !

The gyros here are bomb! They serve them with fries in the middle! I always get the beef gyro with extra tzatzki sauce and onions. It's so yummy. The price the gyros are also very cheap, which makes it even more worth it ! My absolute fav thing to get is the Greek fries. The Greek fries here are little circular potatoes that are served with a lot of feta cheese! It's so yummy. You must get the two together ! They've also recently expanded and taken over the restaurant that was next to them so they have more seating !"}
{"text":"Mediocre but really cheap!

I swear I've had the chicken gyros pita takeout here a hundred times, and a few times it's been really good, a few times maybe awful. They upped the price on the lamb gyros, which is tough and stringy, and the pork one was so forgettable I forgot what it's like. Get the chicken. $5.50.

We had takeout and dine-in here a few times, and it's always faintly disappointing to slightly dismaying. This is swill by Greek standards, but it's still much better than McDonalds and the takeout pita is certainly edible, if you're good and hungry."}
{"text":"Went there early Sunday evening and our chicken gyros were perfect this time.  Crispy with lots of tzatziki.  I was full at the end of the meal.  I rate them 5/5

My husband however did not feel satiated.  He claims that the gyros use to be bigger.  He complained about it.  

Next time I will leave my husband at home :)"}
{"text":"The thing about this place is the grilled octopus. It is actually good and some other stuff like surf and turf.

However the service is so bad I wanted to cry.

The servers are rude. The manager is rude.

The owner can not speak proper English and is an ASHLE.

We went last week and ordered surf an turf for my friend after ordering around 100 worth of food.

After half hour we had to ask them for our surf and turf. They brought a mixed grilled platter after arguing with my friend that he ordered that. Oh well. The beef was so dry it was like dogs food. 

We asked to take that out of the bill. The owner refused to even come talk to us about it. We were obliged to pay for disgusting food. The owner is a total inept, when we faced him he talked to us in Greek? or English? haha I do not know.....

Shame on your attitude sir, you just care about money and do not even tip your servers.

What a way to burn bridges."}
{"text":"Garbage.... Zero flavour, not even salt.... I sued to think Toronto was a great place with great Greek food.... It's now just a cash grab.  Messini.... Shame on you.  The lamb gyro was all gristle, the tasziki sauce was just sour cream."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Danforth stop, the gyros always does the job when you are hungry.  Fresh, generous, moist chunks of lamb and beef with a good dose of garlicky tzatziki, what is not to love?"}
{"text":"I have been to Messini a few times over the years, usually before (or after) a visit to Dora Keogh's Irish pub.

I dropped by today during the Taste of the Danforth festival and really enjoyed their pork gyros. The line up for takeout was huge which is always a good sign and the food did not disappoint. I loved how they put fries in the gyros, it made them even tastier!

The souvlaki is definitely the better choice here. I have had the lunch menu once or twice and you don't get a lot more food, even though the cost is quite a bit higher."}
{"text":"Messini is hands down THE. BEST. gyro place in Toronto. And trust me, as a Greek living away from the homeland for 5+ years, when the craving for an authentic gyro hits, I now know I've found my place! I've had gyros all over north America and nothing compares to Messini's HUGE pitas stuffed with fries and delicious meat! Ask for extra tzatziki of you feel up for it...that stuff is to die for! Definitely look no further for the best gyro outside Greece. This place keeps me going :)"}
{"text":"The veggie pita was tasty but a bit salty, but I would recommend it. It was a nice alternative to falafel's! Also the greek fries were delicious!"}
{"text":"The food and service is great here. The food is reasonably priced for what it is. I recommend the chicken pita!

The restaurant is pretty well maintained. My only complaint is that that bathrooms aren't very clean and smell really bad."}
{"text":"Blah. Seriously. I love tapenade and olives as it might be one of my Favourite things but I couldn't digest theirs. I grimaced each time I ate it. 

I'm not a picky eater but I can't forgive this. Tzatziki was actually good but between the olives that I couldn't swallow and the horrible Saganaki it's unforgivable. 

Many other places in the neighborhood check them out."}
{"text":"I have been here a gazillion times, and i must admit i love it despite the inconsistency. the prices are really good for the amount of food you get especially the lunch or dinner special, which comes with your choice of fries, greek fries (to die for) or potatoes, and an automatic greek salad that is so fresh, drizzled with olive oil and herbs and feta! usually i get the souvlaki plate and sandwich, and they are really good.  i prefer the sandwich because it has fries in them which is the real deal! the tapenade is amazing, few times the bread was not fresh and the greek fries were burned BUT most of the times it was great. I never had a moment where it was so bad that i will never come back. On the other hand, the owner really values his customers, i had an incident where a man very familiar around the danforth comes and sells roses, and me and my friend really wanted to get ones but we had no cash on us, so we were like its ok. All of a sudden we saw the Rose man come up to us and gave us 2 roses, and told us the owner paid for it. turns out he saw us asking  how much was it and saw that we had no cash. Very sweet of him!"}
{"text":"I'm picky, what can I say?

The pork souvlaki is delicious, but the service is crap! The waitress gave a nasty eye to ordering more food (it's MORE FOOD, just bring it!) and she forgot so many side dishes it was getting to be frustrating. And not for us either, the girls beside us were missing a lot of things too.

Rice was mediocre, the potatoes were oily and while it was tasty in general, perhaps Greek food isn't my thing.

I did however, wish I had ordered more pork souvlaki. It was amazing."}
{"text":"This was eh, I got the chicken gyro pita with fries In it, which was different. The chicken was good but the sauce was lacking flavor.  This would be my last visit."}
{"text":"So I was introduced to Messini's in the spring of this year. We went around 11 one night and it was packed (great sign). The food was delicious - chicken and lamb gyros. So delicious - the tzatziki was bomb and everything was super cheap!! Get the chicken souvlaki pita, I like that better than the chicken gyro. The meat is juicier and it tastes like breast meat. Yay! The greek salad is great, get that with the two gyros and you're looking at $15 in total. Amaazinggg!

In the past month, I think I've been at least 3 or 4 times. Sorry thin waist, you've gotta go! 

Last Friday, I was hoping to catch a breakfast/brunch to go at Messini but got there too early at 11 am - they open at 11:30 am. I was so bummed!! I went to my eye doctor's appointment, which was running behind so I ran over to Messini's and was the 2nd person to order. I felt so accomplished. Messini is cheap, good food. 


I'm an addict and I admit it."}
{"text":"having an unexpectedly fantastic meal at Le Coin Grec in Montreal I am beginning a quest for equally amazing greek options in Toronto. I've always enjoyed greek cusine here and there but that Montreal experience absolutely knocked it out of the park for me and I want more.

Where else better to start my search than with my most trusted food resource,Yelp, discovering Messini to be exact.

Deep fried calamari, good. souvlaki, good (expecting great). greek fries, ok. Prices, great! Relatively cheap for the serving sizes. Overall, great prices for just ok food."}
{"text":"Horrible service, worst gyro I have ever had (greeks arent even cooking)  Tasteless food then they charge you an extra $1 for a scoop of tzaziki.  Stay away!!!!    
Bad quality of food.  Nothing like original authentic greek food.   No parking, good luck on finding a spot."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in the area I always go to Messinis the place is amazing. The food is so cheap and affordable and you get so much for your money. I always start with the Greek feta fries they are so delightful and a good start to your meal. The mix of the gyro flavours of the meat and the fries really come together making it so mouth watering and unique. Hands down the best gyro I've ever had and will ever have."}
{"text":"Very busy almost everyday even I came at 10pm. Cheap and delicious, i love the greek salad there, it think it is authentic compare to other restaurant. I also like the pita with the \"olive sauce \", very yummy. Best pita ever !!!! A dinner for two is about 20$ with refill soft drinks. I couldnt finish my chicken wrap. The services is okay and the restaurant is a lil small. You have to line up a lil bit for setting up."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I came across this place via yelp and l
planned an afternoon on the Danforth full of shopping, eating and some of its charm that is easy to miss when we go for the festival. 

Anyways this will now be my gyro fix go-to. This is massive for only $5. Comes with your choose of meat, veggies and French fries. Delicious... But I wouldn't be able to finish it on my own.

We also ordered Greek fries... I've always only had feta crumbled on salad... But boy did this change my perspective on feta and life... This was so creamy and good, and part of the reason I couldn't finish my meat plate cause my fork kept sneaking across the table. Its like it has a mind of its own.

For myself I got the meat plate with came with a salad (Greek, of course) and choice of roast potatoes, fries or rice. I got the pork and roast potatoes. ($13) It was good... The meat was moist but I got some crispy pieces in there too. So good I'm having leftovers for lunch today! 

The bill came to $29 which included a beer. The amount of food we got and the fact that I'm enjoying it today as well... Makes this place a steal! It gets busy, so be prepared to wait. We got there around 5:30 on a Thursday afternoon, so there was no wait but by 6/6:30 there was parties waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite Greek restaurant in Toronto. The service is quick and the waiters are always friendly. The food is fresh and the portions are extremely generous. The prices are also very fair for the amount and quality of food that you get. The  only reason why I didn't give these guys a 5-star rating is 1) the decor is slightly dated and 2) there is usually quite a lineup to be seated however, I would still highly recommend this spot to any Greek food fan."}
{"text":"The Tirokroketes and Greek fries are a must have! I have always gotten the greek fries, but the deep fried cheese balls were a first. They are so gooey, cheesy, and melt in your mouth good. I also got the spanakopita which was good and of course a lamb/beef gyro pita. I was a bit disappointed with their gyros this time around and they have always been my favourite in the city. Next time I might skip the gyro and just share some appetizers. Service is pretty good here and the food comes quick."}
{"text":"This is bar none the only Greek restaurant I will eat in.  Great food with awesome casual atmosphere. 

Greek fries are delicious. Try the gyro pizza. Amazing salads. Super fresh pita. Home made fries (the flat ones). 

Share platters are great for family and with that special someone

Service is super friendly and thoughtful. 

They saw we had young children at our table and automatically the wait staff would put napkin at our table. 

Love the large Greek parties with  100 decible conversations that would put some Cantonese families to shame.  Excellent vibe if you like a hustle bustle resto. 

I haven't been here in a while but while I was gone they expanded. More seating means less waiting for a table. 

You can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"there is NOTHING  authentic about this place.. if i were to give my dog this food he wouldn't even eat it .. this place is for the bouts. the fat guy that sweats standing there  that handles the cash register at night is sigamenos and his d-ck reeks"}
{"text":"My familys favourite spot for Greek food on Danforth. One of the busiest among others on the street and impossible to get seated during Taste of Danforth. Spent $25 total for three hungry people today for dinner! Started off with complimentary warm pita slices with strong olive oil sauce. Then we had a two meat combination platter. Salad had a lot of feta cheese and thick cuts of vegetables were extremely fresh, a little less onion preferred though. Chicken souvlaki could have been a tad more flavourful and moist but appearance was nice. Roasted potatoes were cooked well and in a lightly flavoured oil based sauce. Rice was decent and could use more flavour. Lastly the pork gyros was packed with crispy grilled meat and it was well balanced with fries and saucy vegetables."}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that this the best souvlaki shop in Toronto (huge portions, tasty, fresh, quick, good value for dollar, best feta fries-addictive) which their expanding, super busy business is a testament to, they are also kind. My keys and phone got locked in my car a few weeks ago in front of their restaurant and they were nice enough to lend me their house phone to call CAA and be on the line for 20 minutes. They never complained but just tried to help. There are lots of places to eat in T.O. so why not give your money to nice people?"}
{"text":"If I have a craving for gyros, I would come straight here to Greektown. 

The lunch special is where it is at. $11 and I get a pork gyro, caesar salad for my side and a fountain pop. What's unique about their gyros are that they add french fries to their gyros and stuff them up pretty good with pork and veggie. The pork isn't that dry and the tzatziki blends everything well together. The side of caesar salad is pretty massive too. 

If I want more gyros, I'll make a trip here anytime."}
{"text":"Very filling and a great selection on gyros. Can get packed over the weekend but the wait isn't too bad. Love thr lamb gyros and their calamari."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today, and had was very disappointed given all the hype. Maybe they were having an off day.

We ordered a couple of chicken gyros and pork sticks. The portions were extremely generous for the price, so I'll certainly give them kudos for that. But the big issue was that the meat was dry and incredibly bland. The chicken tasted like there had been zero seasoning put on it. The fries in the gyro were also very undercooked. 

I may give them another chance, since I can't imagine that the food we had was representative of what they usually produce, given all the positive ratings. But the food was so underwhelming during my visit that I felt compelled to write this review."}
{"text":"I live right next to Greektown here in Chicago so I've usually been of the opinion that I've had the best gyros ever. But when I stopped by this place on my trip to Toronto i changed my mind. The gyros sandwich is huge and the gyros themselves are made from giant CHUNKS of meat and not simply ground meat baked after being blended. 

Get the lamb and beef gyros. You'll feel like it's luxury food. And it probably is."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go around the Danforth for some fast Greek food.  I love their dinner portions, and the price is reasonable.  Only one WARNING:  when you tip, tip in CASH!  Do not tip on the interac machine.  Trust me.  The waiters would prefer you tip in cash for a very good reason.

C.L."}
{"text":"Great little place! Generous portions of good greek fast food at very economical prices (which explains its often crowdedness).  I've been going there for over 5 years every time I feel like good gyros or Greek fries.  They have the best Greek fries!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend there recently.

Ordered the fried calamari (huge portion) and greek salad with only 2 olives but a full tomato cut in 4 pieces for $24. He had the chicken skewers. They were very dry.

Cozy environment.  

However, the service was extraordinarily bad. We kept having different servers. None seemed to know the menu or that they did not offer desserts. The wine list is was limited to 2 very cheap tasting house wines that were highly over priced. At one point, my friend ordered a glass of wine. We never saw the woman again.

When I spoke with a staff member about the lousy service, he said \"I know\". 

I then spoke with the owner/manager. He essentially said the his staff was horrible, he knew the service was very poor, he said good staff was impossible to find, and that he knew that the wines were very bad.

However, he said that the place had been around for many years and that the food spoke for itself. 

This place seems dated. I told the owner that he might want to think about keeping up with the times and that he had a lot of competition given all the greek restaurants within the same block. His response -- I'm Greek, I'm stubborn.

This place has the potential to be a much better restaurant."}
{"text":"Been a customer 10 years. After my experience today, I can say I will never go here again. I went to dinner to show my friend how great this restaurant was, we waited over an hour to get our meal and every table around us that arrived after us received theirs first. We asked the waitress about it and she kept hiding from us. We were a promised a discount on our meals because we waited so long, but this never happened - they simply remarked \"you eventually got it\" as though they were planning on charging us for stuff we never received. When half of the meals we ordered did show up, they were inaccurate. It took forever to fix it. Do not come here, especially for dining in."}
{"text":"A essayer si vous êtes en manque de kebab. Ici sont servis sandwichs et assiettes kefta en tout genre. Attention la commande des assiettes prend 2 fois plus de temps que les sandwichs.
La bière grec alpha est à recommander.
Je trouve marrant \"les arguments\" marketing des 2 serveuses blondes comparable à la politique du Jack Astor ^^, ces messieurs sauront de quoi je parle."}
{"text":"I've been here for multiple years for the cheap eats but their service is terrible. Their waitstaff has serious attitude and acts as if you should be privileged to get their attention. They obviously need to train their staff better and not pay English work study students under the table because they don't understand customer instructions."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 1:30pm and there was a 5 minute wait to get seated. 

Pros:
- Well priced
- Food tastes good

Cons:
- We ordered a gyro dinner and they forgot to bring the gyro... Other than that is was up to par. 
- Saw a mouse running around under the table"}
{"text":"Omgomgomgomg, I've only experienced the Taste of the Danforth version, but I CANNOT WAIT to go for a full meal!!"}
{"text":"Messini's has your typical Greek staples (souvlaki, pita, potatoes, cheese, etc...). The service is quick and efficient and they do take out. Overall a good place If you want a quick Greek fix."}
{"text":"It is my two weeks off from school and I have decided to come to Greek town for some good Greek food.  My Korean friend suggested this place, and this place was packed.  The decor is quite nice but I found the lighting a little too dim.  The staffs were friendly and took us to out table once there was one free.  I was expecting to pay around $15 or more just for entree, but I was presently surprised when I checked out the prices on their menu.  $5.53 for a chicken gyros, $10 for a big plate of deep fried calamari, the food were really good.  

The calamari was fresh and batter had a good crunch and not greasy.  There was a free appretizer with pita and olive paste dip.   Very delicious.  The gyros was really good with grilled chicken slices, a creamy sauce and nicely wrapped by warm pita.  I really enjoyed it and it was really filling.  If you want something cheap and tasty, this is the one to order.  I ordered a beer as well for $6.20.  No bad at all pricewse.  The waiter was really chill and split the bill for me and couple other friends.  It was a really good experience over all.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Working in the area, I come here for lunch once every couple of weeks. It's the best Gyro in Toronto in my opinion. Not only is it delicious, but for the price, it might be the best lunch you can get for $7."}
{"text":"Pretty good gyros at a cheap price. The gyros are stuffed full of greasy goodness, including fries. There is the option of having sides with your gyro, but they aren't that great, and the gyro is filling enough. 

We also ordered tzaziki and pita, which were satisfactory, but not memorable. 

The service was quick and courteous, which is all you can ask for. Lunch for 3 runs about $30 tip included."}
{"text":"This is where I go after I eat at a restaurant that has small portions.  Also great after party food.  The gyros are as good as it gets here in Toronto.  They are so busy that the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Messinis is awesome!!! Great Greek food made fast and for a good price. Lively restaurant with friendly service. Ingredients are fresh and delicious. I recommend the spanakopita and pork souvlaki!"}
{"text":"I was unfortunately a bit underwhelmed by this place. We popped in on a busy Sunday afternoon & despite the big line were seated pretty quickly which was a good start.

Our server wasn't particularly friendly & got a couple of things wrong on our order despite the fact she asked us to repeat ourselves while ordering. We both had the pretty standard gyros plate & both felt that the pita was stale & the meat wasn't as tender as other gyros places we've been to.

Nothing was terrible but I suspect there are better spots along Danforth for great gyros."}
{"text":"This is my first time travelling to Greektown and wanted to see what restaurant should I eat in for dinner, I walked around the whole Greektown to absorb the sights and sounds of this place (and hobos yelling at me) until I stop at this restaurant without knowing if it's good or not.

Luckily when I went it, it was before 6 or 7' clock so the place isn't crowded and was quickly seated close to the door which I liked. I ordered a Lamb Gyro and a Ice Tea and it took awhile for them to bring the meal but I did had the time and patience to wait in a sunny yet cool day.

When it arrived, I liked the fact that there's a couple of fries on top of the gyro to substitute the flavour but hated the sauce that was dripping down into my plate. Although, I liked the lamb, it was quite crunchy too which is always a winner in my book, it wasn't that much burnt or dry but a little bit fatty in spots. 

The Lamb Gyro is like five bucks and drink is like 2 which totals to 7/8 dollars (plus tax) which is cheap considering other restaurants in Downtown being expensive. 

The other huge flaw is when I'm going to paid the bill, it took awhile for it to happen due to a row of people coming in and there are one server in particular that I requested the bill numerous times but was unable to just give me the damn bill yet another young server quickly brought it."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Greek restaurant in Greek town! They offer very fresh \"sandwiches\" that are incredibly great for the value. Where else in the city can you get a proper sandwich for $6? They also have a great selection of salads and fries! A MUST try for me."}
{"text":"Still good gyros, salads and fries. They have added a new addition so service and seating is faster and better.

Recommended if you need a gyro carb fix. One platter with two appetizers easily feeds two people."}
{"text":"The gyros at this place makes me want to cry of happiness because they taste SOOO GOOOOD. The prices for them are awesome too! The service isn't that good because the restaurant is always busy so the waiters don't get to visit your table often. But they're always hot so it makes up for it :)"}
{"text":"I've been going in on & off for the last 7 years as this is a staple gyros Danforth institution (they put fries in the sandwich, yum!!!) the prices are very reasonable, however, the service is SO BAD with so much attitude.

They're always busy with line-ups out the door because the food is good, and the servers treat you like a second class citizen because they are obviously not lacking in business.

No more patronizing of Messini as I go to Alexandros (on Logan Ave north of Danforth) as I ask them to put fries in my gyros and they're SO much nicer and friendlier here."}
{"text":"Won't be coming back again. Seated us at the wrost table in the house. No service here at all. 

Asked for better table for 30 mins and they just seated other people in the two tables that opened up. If they seat you at a bad table, just leave, that's what I should've done."}
{"text":"Messini's is a classic case of a restaurant with excellent food at a great price....with sub-par service you have to suffer through. I go to this place quite a bit, so I clearly have made my choice in priorities! Honestly, the pitas are so good, the Greek fries are delicious, same with the salad, and the beer is cheap. But be prepared to sometimes be forgotten about, receive the wrong order, and not get any modifications honoured. Can't say it isn't worth the delicious (and cheap) food though!"}
{"text":"Messinis is a great place to come for some Greek eats, my significant other and I often come here for a sit down bite. We love the Greek fries and they're more than generous with the feta! While the food is authentic and delicious we don't always receive the best service here. The kitchen staff is very friendly but sometimes our servers are inattentive. I order the Chicken souvlaki plate with rice and salad typically."}
{"text":"Awesome tasty food. Everyone should try the Greek fries, might be a little crowded but it's place where waiting is worth it. The prices are fair and dishes come quick. Check it out."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is exceptionally beautiful and service is fast and consistently on point. Got the Chicken gyro on a pita with a side of Greek salad - beautifully cooked and well seasoned chicken, fries were made fresh, and salad was light and refreshing."}
{"text":"Overall: great food with authenticity at a good price! 

* Atmosphere - looks small on the outside, but can fit quite a lot of people. 

* Taste - I ordered the \"pork gyro\", which was packed with tomatoes, fries, pork, onions, and sauce. It's definitely worth it and tastes great! We also ordered the \"Greek fries\" that were seasoned with feta cheese and came with sauce as well. Pretty good! 

* Service - average service. The waiter came by enough times, but it was hard to get attention near the end. 

* Recommendations - ordering the fries and gyro can be quite heavy to eat together.

* Other - it's closest to take the subway to 'Chester' stop. Also there's the Athens Greek bakery near, which is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in before heading to the airport, was around lunch time and we were in somewhat of a rush. We were seated at a booth at the back of the restaurant with a view over the door and the service area, our waiter dropped our menus right away and took our drink order (Water) after about 10 minutes he came back too our orders( I'm pretty simple when it comes to greek food), so i went for the \"never fails\" Gyro. That was the last our waiter visited our table!!.
After about 20 minutes our food was dropped and it was average at best. The meat was drier than it needed to be, and the fries were OK. After about another 15 mins we picked up our check and paid.
The positive from this experience was, we were in and out fast. Not somewhere that i would return, unless i'm in a hurry and looking for average (at best) gyro's."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst experience I've had in terms of food quality and customer service. We ordered 2 gyros combo with greek fries and salad. Our gyros and salad came but the greek fries didnt come until we finished our meal even though we requested it so many times. We were neglected the entire night. Eventually we got tired of waiting so we went up to pay for the bill but instead of being apologetic, management confronted us with racist slurs\"what are you chinese people doing up here?\". If you're around the area, there are plenty of other greek restaurants."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for food after a long night of liver trauma.

Everything is very inexpensive. The gyro's are great and have fries in them which is awesome.

The atmosphere is also amazing. Since it caters to those who can appreciate a good deal, you end up with a lot of fellow young city people around you and I've never gone in without a good conversation striking up between tables.

If you go you absolutely have to get the greek fries. There's noone who does it like them. They cut the fries medalion style with ripples so they catch and scoop as well as possible, then they cover them with tons of feta, drizzle them in olive oil and herbs, then put them in the broiler so it's a golden brown at the top.

Other restaurants make greek fries but none compare. Just beware they are large so if you're doing a wrap you'll want to share one between 3 people (or maybe 2 for guys)."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favourite! Great food and best part  it's not expensive. I usually get the combination which comes with your choice of either a gyro (chicken, pork, or lamb) souvlakis and I forget the rest along with 2 sides usually come to less than 20 bucks! Keep in mind 2 people eat for 20 bucks it's a win for sure!
They dony take reservations so During the weekend and even some times in the evenings it's a bit of a wait since the place isn't too big but it is definitely worth the wait. Service isn't all that great and I'm usually huge on customer service but whatever food is awesome."}
{"text":"3.5*

I got the grilled calamari (the octopus was out) and it was done perfectly. not overcooked. 
The pork souvlaki stick was flavorful but overdone..dry and tough. Not my fave. 
prices are very reasonable and the outside patio is fun to hang out at"}
{"text":"Favourites: pork/lamb gyros wrap and the village salad. The roasted potatoes are delicious, but the rice is bland. Food is consistent, service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good service and will become irritated easily if you don't, you may not enjoy your experience. Otherwise, if you're satisfied with the fact that as long as the food gets delivered and they come over when you flag someone down, then you should be ok.

Take the TTC, get off at Chester, and it's a minute-walk over.

Food is good and affordable. Get a gyros for under $6 and it comes with a lot of fresh meat off the spit and soft fries! I typically come here just for it.

Another item that I like is the gyros pizza, which is a personal sized pizza with cheese, vegetables, and meat. It's not greasy at all, which provides a pleasant tasting experience since I'm not a fan of greasy pizza.

Sometimes they'll try to bring all the food at the same time, so if you order the pizza for example you will end up waiting a bit longer than others that get gyros or rice dishes.

One of those places that's safe to organize a lunch or dinner at, though it can get busy."}
{"text":"I love this place. Amazing prices, amazing portions. $20 (tax included) can get two people completely full and unable to walk. I highly recommend the Greek fries and grilled calamari. Staff are extremely hard working, friendly and professional. I took off one star because I was advised that the tips we leave for the server is not given to the server or distributed to any of the staff members. Boo!"}
{"text":"The lamb gyro was great. Although the lamb was cooked well done, it didn't lose any of its juicyness. However, the entire gyro tasted a bit bland, which could be easily remedied with some hot sauce.

The service, as mentioned before, is not great. But st $4-5/ gyro, just treat this place as you would for a food court. With lower expectations for service, you could definitely bite into your gyro a little happier!"}
{"text":"This place used to be great, and I can remember the many good times I had here. Now it's just going downhill day by day. I ordered a lamb & beef gyro and waited more than 30 minutes. The rude waiter just keep on eyeing me without explanation. When I asked him he made some vague and indifferent explanation. Eventually the food came and it was all fat and disgusting. Half of the plate is fat. When I asked the waiter and explained I've been here many times and have never had this, he's like \"what do you want me  o do? What do you want me to do?\" This place is done, I am over this place and will never visit again."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place is so busy that they've expanded next door. The food is great, the service is quick, and the prices are right. My wife and I frequently go here for takeout, which is fast and delicious. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Messini's, in my opinion, is a staple in any Danforth-resident diet. I eat at Messini's at least twice a month and it's never a choice that I regret.

First off, Messini's is located on the Danforth, just outside of Chester Station. It's in a pretty good location and that's probably why it has so much traffic. Second, it's insanely cheap- for A LOT of food. Trust me, I can eat a lot and I'm ALWAYS stuffed after a meal from Messini's.

Whenever I go to Messini's, I always bring someone with me who is down for a pretty big meal themselves. Why? Because Messini's has the best double gyro pita combo. This pretty much consists of 2, yes- count it, TWO, chicken gyro pitas (or any other meat of your choice- I'm just a huge chicken fan), a salad (any person in the right mind gets the Greek salad, and fries (again, any person in the right mind get the Greek fries. Have you ever had a feta cheese coma before? Well, get ready for one. 

The gyros are always really good. The pita is warmed up perfectly. I hate when my pitas get a bit toasty and crunchy on the ends and they end up falling apart when they're folded. At Messini's this doesn't happen. It's always heated just to the perfect temp. The fries in the gyros are USUALLY fresh (not always, but usually). I love the generous amount of tzatziki that they put into the pitas and the amount of meat is very substantial as well.

Greek salad is the best thing that ever happened to me- but only when it comes from Messini's. Sooo much feta cheese and the dressing is so simple and yet so good. They drizzle on just the right amount every time and it's definitely big enough to share.

And for the Greek fries. This will be what sets your feta cheese coma into place. Feta cheese just tastes so much better when it's toasted and melted on top of a pile of fries. I'm in heaven whenever I go to Messini's.

Now, if you're wondering why I did all this raving, but they only got a 4, it's because of their level of customer service. It's pretty important to me to have great customer service and this doesn't seem to be consistent. All their servers need to have the same mindset. If this changes, then this 4 will definitely go up to a 5!"}
{"text":"Location: 445 Danforth Ave Toronto ON M4K 1P1 (Greek Town) 
Price: $$
Service: ehh

Out of honestly I never really had authentic Greek food- other than Mr. Greek and that doesn't ever count! This review is strictly base on taste and service- not how authentic or original the food is. 

Went to this restaurant two weeks ago with the fam. The line was long (typical cause it was a Saturday night) and they didn't even ask us about seatings until we spoke to them- wasn't too happy about that. I don't mind if the wait is long but seriously they didn't even brother to ask how many people we had or if we were dining in... Then when it came to seating us and checking up on our table it was pretty much non existence. Most of the time it was another waiter that had to check up on us because our waiter was no where to be found. 

We tried most of the items on the menu from the gyros to the grilled chicken to the salad... Overall it was alright nothing amazing. Most of the time the food was tasteless. The only thing that was saving the food was the sauce on the side that they provided. 

My favourite part to review is their fries haha. They had two types of fries; one was the regular rectangle style and the other was the ruffle potato chip style. To be quite honest they were both plain so it was picking the better of the two :(! There was something about the ruffle potato fries that made it yummy. It was sort of crispy but not too much to take way the taste of the softness inside- but it's not something I'll die for...

Verdict: 2.5"}
{"text":"Highlights:
Cheap like nobody's business
Good looking greek men
meat.  (of the food type...)

it's a win win win.

The food that went around our table of 6 was all really good.  This is one of those places that you give 4/5 stars to because you are a regular and you like the service- not solely for the food.  It's good, just not spectacular.  I like this place because it's generally good value and I'm happy I was introduced to it.
The tightly packed restaurant is also just nice if you want a bustling atmosphere without being downtown in clubland.

a-ok.

Some setbacks: The meat did not seem consistently cooked.  Some of it was way too dry..perhaps sitting around a bit.. Some of the lamb was incredibly fatty and other parts were dry... I would want either lean all the way or consistent marbling just so I'm not eating chunks of fat (although some people enjoy that).
I usually wait to visit the locale a few times before I review but I'm fairly confident I will stay with 3 unless I become a regular, which I highly doubt."}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place was at Taste of Danforth. They had the largest line-up so I was curious enough to try and thank goodness I did. Their pork gyros are my favourite thing to order. Though I do find it a little dry, maybe they can make it more juicy? I also am in love with the Greek fries in lieu of the cheese they use, so delicious. One of my favourite places for gyros downtown! I'm really hoping they open a location somewhere closer in the GTA, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"I took my friends to this place, and they adored it.
We ate so much:

My friend and I ate a combo, in the combo we had Greek salad it was fresh and a nice start.then we had Greek fries which are French fries with feta. Then we had a souvlaki pita which was great.

The noise level was fine and it was casual,busy sometimes.
We had a nice server and I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Food is cheap, but taste is just ok. The mixed (pork/chicken) gyro pita I got was really good for the first few bites, but then tasted pretty bland for the rest of it. I've tried the feta fries before too. It's chip-shaped fries with feta cheese on top. I thought it was ok, nothing too special.

My friend got the entree with side of potatoes (which she said didn't have an flavour), and she wasn't too impressed with her chicken souvlaki. The tapenade is nice, as is the messini salad which has dill in it."}
{"text":"Been going to Messini now for a couple years and I crave it almost every day! This is some of the best, if not the best greek food in Toronto. I always get the greek fries because the feta is so fresh and tasty. I also get the Pork Gyros which is hands down the best gyros ive ever had! Only downside is the wait staff is a little slow and confused at times but overall ive had great experiences here and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good to come to for lunch. I've never tried the non-vegetarian gyros but that's one thing they're famous for so definitely have one of those. I personally always go for either the Greek fries (yum!!) or the calamari (also yum). It's also pretty cheap, so that's another bonus. It's a good casual place to come to when you want to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Came with some local friends as I was here on a work trip. 

First off, pretty quiet at 6pm on a Tuesday, so easily found a table. And then the appies were pretty fresh and well made (grilled octopus and greek fries). EVERYTHING is better with feta. =)

Now, onto the main deal, the gyros. We each ordered a different one: pork, chicken, and mixed meat. SO MUCH FOOD. With the appies, I could barely get through half of it, but it wasn't for the lack of trying or the goodness of the food. Definitely a great value as each gyro was $5-$6. So much value. Amazing. Definitely need to come back!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time due to the Yelp reviews .
I had high expectations .
I asked for red house wine after long day of work expecting a full body wine but was told it was sweet so I ordered a Greek beer . 

I always order as appetizer in a Greek restaurant (must have) is the saganaki , the saganaki here was served cold and I would not recommend it . It's rubber .

Next came the grilled octopus which was pretty good as another appetizer . 

My kids ordered pork souvlaki platter which came out with single stick . It was ok .
My other son ordered lamb combo. 

The service was ok , perhaps it was due to being close to end of the night.

 My first and last time unless they provide better service to food .
The Yelp rating is over rated ."}
{"text":"My friends took me to Messini one afternoon because they really wanted their famous Gyros. Apparently, during the annual \"Taste of the Danforth\" the line-up for food from their booth is massive, one would need to stand in line for hours just for a stick of meat or whatever else is on the menu for the food festival. I'm not a big fan of Greek food, because this cuisine is all about meat. But to my surprise, Messini had a good selection of vegetarian dishes that could be easily converted to vegan dishes. My friends ordered Greek Fries and Messini signature Pork Gyro Pita. I ordered their Vegetarian Pita, sans Feta Cheese.  The Vegetarian Pita consisted of fresh leafy green veggies, grilled eggplant and onions, fresh tomatoes, olive paste and fresh cut fries all stuffed into a white pita. It was so fresh, crunchy and very tasty -I enjoyed every bite. The fries made my day because it saved me from ordering fries on the side when I just wanted a few pieces. Plus, it also saved me from unnecessary calories... which is way more important to me than cash. Speaking of cash, the Vegetarian Pita is well priced at $3.50. I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"After wandering (somewhat) aimlessly through Downtown Toronto, going up into the CN Tower and subwaying it over to Danforth for lunch, Messini is an awesome choice for a very good (very big!) meal. I have a fair amount of experience with Greek food being from NYC, but this place blows everything out of the water as far as I'm concerned.

They have a great lunch menu with your typical assortment of gyros, pitas, souvlaki, etc. I had the pork gyro which was excellent and service with these great Greek-style crinkle cut French fries (and fries in the pita as well!?). The food was fresh, flavorful and served promptly. The lunch special includes a beverage, so for something like $8.00, you have a great meal. 

There was a big lunchtime crowd when we went and the place itself is nice and modern and the service was fast and efficient. A little excursion over to Greektown will be worthwhile if you come to Messini."}
{"text":"Cheap greek food on the danforth. It use to be alot better but after recent encounter we have established a better greek place in sauga. 

Can't go wrong with their greek fries though.. so delicious and cheap! Their fried calamari is also very good but portions were on the smaller side. Chicken Slovakia pita is also very good and delicious but the gyro was only OK. We've had better elsewhere. Service is good and quick and would recommend if you were in the area, but danforth has so many other sit down greek restaurants that are also on par that you can't really go wrong with any of them!"}
{"text":"The lamb gyro is incredibly fatty,maybe the chicken is better,  they were very nice when I brought it to their attention and offered to make me anther one or refund me.  I didn't take the chance, I'm starving"}
{"text":"Excellent place for gyro's and other casual greek fare. The gyros here are ginormous, shaved off the spit and stuffed in a grilled pita with strong tzaziki sauce, onions and best of all, french fries-veritable greek diner food. Lunch specials are pretty decent, you can get a choice of gyros, pitas or meat steaks with choice of fries, salad, rice, potatoes and and soft drink for the $9-15 range. Salad?-their greek salad is real salad, no iceberg for filler, you get straight up olives, chunks of tomatos, olives and cucumbers with a healthy dash of creamy feta on top. So come here when you're hungry and be prepared for lineup and a wait at the door-this place ain't popular for nuthun. 

And you will leave stuffed, heaving your mediteranean stuffed belly off the table."}
{"text":"I will say this,  im not reviewing this based on their table service, never have sat down to be served to eat and probably wont. Just like getting, gyro or souvlaki to go. Personally I just dont like to dine alone even if i had the time to be served, its kind of depressing atleast for me. So my order are usually to go, I get off and on Chester and we are good to go being so close to the subway.

Great portion at a great price and you ask why is only a 3 star. It mainy because it not the best I have, its decent but medeocre at best and given the owner are greek seem tragic but not my place to criticize. I think alot of repulation is what driving business that or it pretty inexpensive meal over all, 6-7 is good. I dont think there are the best on the danforth but they are good enough, but there are penty of place on danforth to get good gyro/ souvlaki, after all it is greek town."}
{"text":"The gyro meat was hard and greasy... The greek fries oily and overcooked, the skewers were very dry and chewy. The service was good, and so was the grilled calamari. Not going back."}
{"text":"Get the daily special for lunch under 10 dollars and you won't want to eat dinner how full you're going to feel.  The meat flavors are amazing.  Strong garlic flavours coming from the wraps.  Really good deal for the price.  It's places like this that make you realize how stupid it is to eat and food chains like Dennys, Boston Pizza etc where you pay arm and a leg for crap food when you can get home cooked flavours and portions like this.  One of the best cheap restaurants on the Danforth hands down."}
{"text":"This place would be a five but I find especially over the last year the gyros have gone downhill. Either the meat is too dry, the pita is almost burned  or the ingredients are just not fresh. 

I will go here for the greek fries and its a great place for after club food, since they are open late, I don't think I know when they close actually."}
{"text":"Busy busy busy. You have people coming in just for a take out gyros, and you have singles cramped up against the tables on the side, and you have parties of 2 or more in the already small, restaurant. 

The place for sit down is tiny.  The were a few tables awardly placed in spots, but it was still okay. It's noisy, but you can get a conversation in. 

The service was good, even though I noticed one guy checking his iPhone constantly, he also was always watching and on top of the water filling, and plate taking away when needed. 

Food was good. Lots of selection and not just gyros. it's like Bubba Gump, but gyros style. Gyros with pita, gyros with rice, gyros with souvlaki sticks, gyros just meat and they have lamb, pork and chicken. 
They also had a beef/lamb kebab which was really good. 
The best deal on the menu was the pita for $7-9 depending on the meat you get.  if you want salad and rice, add another $5. 

I'd come back again, but there's just so much choice along the strip. I like this because it was highest rated, and cheaper, no pretentiousness."}
{"text":"$5.11 tax-in for a tasty gyros *filled* with meat, veg, sauce and fries. Seriously, who could disagree? No wonder the place was rammed on a Sunday mid afternoon. The only downside is that the service quality really takes a hit when they're that busy -- customers unfamiliar with the place will have to figure out for themselves to grab a menu and go to the cash register for take out."}
{"text":"My friends had been raving about Messini's gyros and fries for weeks and weeks by the time I finally went with them, unfortunately I didn't have a chance to see what they were raving about.

We were sat quickly enough, just after 1:30pm on a weekday, most of us ordered the special which comes with fries or salad, pop and a gyros. After about twenty minutes the salads came. Decent enough, nothing too special, but they didn't scrimp on the feta so we were pleased.

But forty minutes later, less so. We'd been trying to get the attention of our server and had noticed that many other tables were returning food and complaining, so we were in fine company. I went to the front to speak with the cashier since our server had been ignoring us and the second I got to the cashier she runs in, waving me back and telling me that they're swamped. (Funny though, two tables who came in later were served and eating gyros way before we were, it wasn't full, but we were still gyro-less.)

It became evident that they had lost our order and forgotten about us. Instead of apologizing the server blamed the cashier and we received a new order in about 10 minutes. By the time it came to settle up we were a bit peeved but at least full. Going to pay, they had combined our bills instead of splitting them up as we requested, alright, so as we were figuring out how much we all owed, the cashier cut in, \"You don't understand the bill? 5$ ISN'T enough (Referring to money I was swapping with a friend) don't you see? You had 3 items, this was $5, this was $8,...\" The condescending attitude was icing on the cake. 

Sure, the gyros was tasty but not enough for the time and attitude."}
{"text":"Disappointed with my recent experience. Quality and service has dropped significantly. Also, who doesn't serve pita with their chicken souvlaki plates? Tiny portions, dry meat and rice and rude staff. Today will be my last time ever giving business to Messini."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service is bad. It seemed like there were 8 people working behind the counter - some working hard others not so much...

We walked in off street for gyro to go.  Took them 30 minutes to make 2 sandwiches  - with other customers coming in and getting out ahead of us... Just poorly organized/managed.

Sandwich was pretty good value though..."}
{"text":"It was interesting...the addititon of french fries was kind of a neat twist...didn't add to the taste or texture but was something to talk about. The meat itself was not the highest of quality but is pretty much expected for the price paid. Though not exactly unique or distinctive in taste (although, it can be a bit salty in big doses), the price and hours available are big selling points. I would like to try more of the dinner options, though it seems more pricy. Overall, from what i've tried it's pretty average. Great for a cheap snack when it comes to their gyros."}
{"text":"Terrible service!! Will not be back.

No one acknowledged you when you walk in even though the Restaurant is only 1/2 full. Waited for 7 minutes at the table with no waiter serving, we had to get up to look for a waiter and ask for water and menu.

Orders were wrong.  No water refills. No one to clean up the plates. Everyone working there looks very unhappy. No thank you when you pay.

They just don't care?"}
{"text":"Pretty much my go-to place whenever I'm close to the Danforth area.  It's been my favourite cheap place to go since I was a kid, and I don't think that's going to change any time soon.  I'm always super excited when they have lamb, but the chicken and beef gyros are just as good!  For $5-7 bucks, you'll be hard pressed to find a place that can offer you something so deliciously filling."}
{"text":"Messini is one of my favourite restaurants in the Danforth, largely because they offer a killer vegetarian pita (which, speaking as a firsthand member of a largely meat-eating greek family), is a goddamn revelation.

Eat the Greek fries. No really...they pile feta on top and bake it until it cries. Among my circle of friends I always play designated driver on Friday nights, but if I was drunk and hungry...I wouldn't settle for anything other than Greek Fries from Messini.

PS - The owner is a killer dude. Tall, Greek, gold chains and a chest of hair that would make Chuck Norris bow down in submission. It just adds to the ambience."}
{"text":"Gyros are good. Napkins are ridiculous - I've got a pita dripping tzatsiki down my arm and a napkin the size of a toilet paper square.  Cheap, good, bring a roll of paper towels."}
{"text":"We had gyros last night in Hamilton down town and decided this one will be a rather authentic experience due to being in Greek town. We were disappointed however because of the bland and dry taste. My husband liked the meat, but if you are a leaner meat eater like myself, you might find the lamb and beef meat to be a bit fatty and chewy. I wanted to keep eating, but couldn't force myself to keep chewing through the fat pieces. I didn't know I could tell apart from a good and not so good gyro until tonight. I wish I could say otherwise."}
{"text":"Awesome!!
I skipped this place for a while because it was too busy, plus the Greek Fries shrunk (lol)
But I was in the neighborhood last week, and there were seats available, so I headed in even though I was by myself.
I ended up ordering too much, I forgot how big the food was.
I started off with a bit of pita and some olive tapenade (pita is a better choice than the bread they used to serve as a starter.)
And a gigantic village salad (I almost overdosed on feta cheese (and hooray for only salad, no lettuce).
Then came the Greek fries that I ordered in place of regular fries.
I mentioned that in past the Greek fries (dollar chips topped with feta, then put under the broiler) had shrunk, but they are full sized again, and they are delicious.
Then came my chicken gyro's that I dumped all over my shirt lol.
Messini is one of the few places in the city that makes their own gyro's (mmmm real meat)
I was too full to even touch the pizza I ordered, the server was very happy to wrap it up so I could enjoy it the next day.

I'll definitely be back now that the Greek fries are full sized again, and now that it is cold, people will stay away."}
{"text":"The large Greek salad was the best salad I have ever had. They put a lot of feta on it.... just amazing."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and people seemed to really enjoy it. When you walk in there are the spinning racks of meats. Glorious. The smell, heavenly. 

Got the lunch special,  a pork plate on Wednesday 
$9! I could not even finish it. I was also useless at work in the afternoon. 

The service was friendly and it came with a drink. The food came out exceptionally quick. 

As for Greek food. I was enjoying the meal. The pork was a little bland but I think that's Greek food? You season title yourself afterwards. It didn't bother me. I loved the tzatziki sauce. 

The side of Greek potatoes were very well done, lots of lemon and garlic flavor. The fries and salad sides also looked good a d would try them another time. 

I would definitely go back and try something else."}
{"text":"I had been eyeing Messini for some time, but it was not until recently that I got a chance to try it and folks it did not disappoint! BEST GYRO EVER! 

Before going to a concert at the near by music hall I opted for a quick bite at Messini, my friend needed to use a washroom so he did not object to the stop. Upon entering, the place was fairly intimate and buzzing on a Wednesday night. I was greeted right away and my takeout order was taken, 1 lamb gyro with everything (tzatziki, tomato, onion, and french fries). They also had chicken and pork gyro but I am a lamb junkie so I did not hesitate in making a choice. They had their three meat options on huge skewers and they were carving the meat fresh to order. All the ingredients were wrapped in a pita and delivered to me very quickly. That Gyro did not stand a chance! I quickly went into devour mode, much to the chagrin of my friend who was regretting his decision to have dinner beforehand. 

After one bite I was in gyro heaven. The lamb was so juicy and tender it was unbelievable; the amount of lamb in the pita was very generous. The lamb itself had a good mix of meat and fat, the chunks of meat absolutely melted in my mouth. I really appreciated that the lamb was not cut too thin but in nice sized chunks. All the toppings complemented the meat so well, the sharp taste of the raw onion cut through the taste of the lamb, the tomatoes added sweetness and the fries in the sandwich is a stroke of genius! I don't know if I can go back to gyro without fries, it just wouldn't be the same. The tzatziki was not over done but it had just the right amount without completely taking over the sandwich, to top it all off the pita was slightly grilled and perfectly fluffy. They get bonus points for not giving you a slew of toppings options; they only give you the authentic toppings (tomato, onion, tzatziki, and fries) if you don't want a certain topping you can take it off. There is no Subway like topping bar (like many shawarma places) rather you are having the gyro the way its supposed to be done, lettuce does not belong on gyro, or shawarma for that matter! *rant over*

My sandwich was more than enough to satisfy my hunger and at $6 it was quite the bargain. However the combination of tzatziki (garlic sauce) and raw onion did necessitate several pieces of gum throughout the night, so probably not a place you want to take your date. Garlic and onion breath aside this gyro knocked my socks off, next time I am in the area I will definitely return. 

*If you are ever drinking in this area a gyro would make the perfect drunk food! I do believe they are open late on weekends."}
{"text":"Amazing value for the low price point. The Greek fries are a must. 

I shared the combination meal which comes with your choice of 2 pitas, salad and rice or potatoes for $17. Upgrade the potatoes to Greek fries.

The chicken gyro is tasty but not what I expected. Gyros are typically formed into a loaf before being placed on the spit, so when the meat is cut, it comes out as slices. The gyro at Messini however, is more like a shawarma. The flavour is still good, but I'm not a fan of the shawarma texture. The pita was packed with a generous portion of meat along with veggies and french fries...I was too full to finish. 

The side salad had a lot of feta...great for cheese lovers like me!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Messini for a while, but I HATE lineups and I always see one outside of Messini and thus am often deterred. I wonder if the guy with the restaurant directly next door with the exact same fare cries himself to sleep at night because he doesn't have lineups nearly as long (or loud). 

And you know what, it was just ok. A little too much cheese if you ask me. And a little too much carbs. That's not a sentence. 

They put fries on everything, which I thought was an American-specific cuisine highlight, but apparently the Greeks enjoy gratuitous fat too. 

I had the Greek salad, which was like 75% cheese, 10% vegetables and 10% other. It was delicious and no, I was not complaining about paying a rock-bottom price for so much delicious and possibly imported feta (chic, chic). 

But then I made the admitted mistake of ordering the feta fries. It's like a poutine (Jesus, how many poutines can one relatively fit person eat before they settle somewhere on your ass....I'm waiting for it....I'm waiting) but covered in feta cheese and herbs and dressing. Very good. 

My husband had the chicken pita, which I also ate parts of, which was also delicious. But yeah, just a bit too much cheese methinks. 

What I don't understand are the inexplicable lineups. Namely because there are a shit-ton of other gyro places, including the one right next door, and because from what I can tell, these gyros don't beat the shit out of the other gyros. So what gives? Still good though. And cheap."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is the best Greek food in Toronto- so yummy and authentic. Prices are a bit high beyond just getting a gyro, and service is meh, but worth it for the food."}
{"text":"I love going here before the Danforth Music Hall. 

Our favourite order for two: 
Two Greek Salads 
One order Greek Fries (MUST GET!!!!)
Two Kalamaki sticks (the last option on the appetizer page)
One order Gigantes
Small gyro plate (just the meat) 

I dream about the Greek Fries - enough said."}
{"text":"Messini's is THE place to eat on the Danforth. The Gyro's & Salads are incredible priced for what you receive - the fries in the gyro are a delicious touch. 

I would recommend to anyone passing by, however the wait for a table prevents it from earning a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Don't get to come here often as it's fairly far from where I live, but it's at least conveniently near a subway stop - just a quick walk. The food is priced so well for the portions you get and its also so delicious. The Greek fries are an absolute must. Their feta is the best I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"If you're craving some true, authentically flavoured Greek food, offered at a great price, this is the place to come!

Gyro wraps at only 5 bucks, how can anyone complain about that?! Plus, they're stuffed with fries too....as long as you dont mind the double up on the carb (which I certainly don't),  this is a sure fire excellent choice :)

The chicken souvlaki with tatziki on the side was so juicy and flavourful.  

I would also recommend the Greek fries that have white vinegar and feta on top, brought back some delicious tastes from my childhood haha!"}
{"text":"One of the best Greek cuisine on Danforth. Food is fresh in huge portions and most importantly, not too expensive. Their Greek fries is very unique and a must-try. Service is good but it can get busy at times although orders still came very quickly. The only downside to this place is the lack of parking space since it is right on a busy street like Danforth."}
{"text":"Messini's never fails to disappoint. Always busy. Good for lunch, dinner or late night eats. Great price. Always double up on the pita dinner for a couple more bucks."}
{"text":"Best tasting gyros pita wrap I've ever had! Granted, most likely also the least healthy as well with their generous servings of french fries in the pita. What. You heard me, IN the pita.  

If that didn't capture your interest, I don't know what will."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for years now and can't get enough. The pitas are so good and oh my lanta, those Greek fries! The prices are unbeatable, usually busy and sevice isn't great but its worth it for the food."}
{"text":"I used to work on the danforth and therefore have come here many tines.  although since i moved not in the last few years.  however yesterday decided to get a vegetarian wrap pita alongside greek fries and salad.  to be honest the wrao was okay   way too many onions and for a vegetarian wrap there coulda been more alternative vegetables.  it was like the whole thing was onions and it made the wrap terrible to eat.  i woulda have rated it a 2 but since the other food was decent and consistently decent in the last few years it deserves a three overall.  the prices are good too."}
{"text":"This place felt like a very generic Greek restaurant.  Nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing bad. It had decent prices and decent portions, with decent service, and decent freshness.

Convenient for lunch and the service was pretty fast, but not something you want to go for a date or special occasion."}
{"text":"there are not much places where you can get dinner for 2 for under 20 bucks! This place you can for sure! and be really really full from it! There's always a line up here for dinner. I love the idea of putting fries in their pita sandwiches. However the meat is sometimes really dry, it depends on the day/chef. I used to go downtown from Richmond Hill to come for the food, because its worth it. The potato dish with lots of feta on top? Yum!"}
{"text":"IT'S LIKE MAN VS FOOD IN A SANDWICH!!! SO GOOD! SOOOOO GOOD. Seriously they put the fries in your gyro. Now when I'm at home I just put everything into a kaiser...pancakes, bacon and hash browns in a kaiser? MOAR CARBS? Yes please."}
{"text":"This place almost deserves 5 stars when considering the value. Your meal will come with massive portions so don't bother ordering appetizers. The quality of the food and the great prices are hard to match. The Greek Fries as everyone says are wonderful although of questionable authenticity. The restaurant was packed on my early Friday visit and while the main restaurant is unremarkable the patio is quite charming and boasts a good number of tables. Over all the menu isn't huge and could be described as meeting the tastes of North American's more than being geared toward serving a wide variety of Greek dishes, but hey if you're North American what the hell! The food is very good although not great, however when I want a nice Greek meal, minus some of the more traditional favorites, in a nice setting this is where I'll be heading. The money I save will go toward the rest of the evening on the town."}
{"text":"The parental unit and I came here for dinner last night.

The service was really, really good!"}
{"text":"gotta say after many years of meals and even catering i had a bad experience for the first time saturday december 19th.

i ordered for my daughter and myself an octopus appetizer, a calamari dinner and coffee a bit later.

the octopus came first and was rubber. i could hardly cut it with their knives and had i been able to find my waiter again i would have said something. being diabetic i had to eat something and i worked my way through it and still no waiter. at last we called another waiter who delivered the calamari dinner. when at last i did see our waiter i managed a coffee out of him but that was the last of him and i had to ask someone else for a refill and they let me down too. i called the manager over and he took the coffee off the bill because i was too fed up to wait for another and he tried to make a very lame excuse for the waiter.

anyhow it was my fault not to say anything about the octopus but then i did eat it but i really would have said something to the waiter if he ever cared to return in a timely manner.

be a while before i go back."}
{"text":"I love this place, but it's EXTREMELY INCONSISTENT. The prices are very reasonable, especially for the gyro.

Any gyro is fine--stick with the pork if you don't want to experiment. If they even have lamb, it can be overly fatty. I think they used to get a lot of complaints about it because they will often warn people that it can be fatty. It's fine that it can be fatty, but sometimes it's just more fat than meat.

The Greek salad is probably one of the best salads that you can get from a restaurant in Toronto.

The pita with olive paste is such a bonus.

The Greek fries are worth getting.

Many of the items on their menu might be unavailable when you visit, depending on the day, week, or month. Things like the calamari are one of the items usually unavailable--which is a shame because it's also one of the best orders of calamari in the city.

If you get a meal here when the cooks are at their best, you will get one of the best meals. It's just a shame that it's a 50/50 chance of getting a below average meal if you go on the wrong day, or if the wrong guys are cooking, or if their kitchen stock isn't in top shape.

Yes, the wait staff can be pretty bad, but they do tend to hire people who are newer to Canada, and it's extremely busy in there the majority of the time. The longer term staff probably already realized that they are still packed every day, even with their half-assed service. The best tip to deal with them is to just call them over, don't just sit around expecting to be treated like royalty.

PS: I had a good laugh at the guy below who claims that the gyro served at Messini's isn't authentic. I guess that dude didn't see the Wikipedia page for gyro."}
{"text":"Just went here last night with a friend for dinner but I'd never go back.

The food was good--we had the mixed grill plate and shrimp.

The service was terrible.  Maybe the worst I've ever had in Toronto.  I ordered a Stella (draft) and was then informed they were out (totally fine) but was never given a chance to order anything else.  They were out of cranberry juice for my friend.  We were never checked on nor were our waters ever refilled.  Without AC, the temperature was 30+--we really could have used the water.  Finally we were rushed out and the Stella was still on the bill.  

Beyond the horrible service, the thing that struck me was how unfriendly the restaurant's vibe is.  My experience of Greek restaurants, on and off the Danforth, in Toronto and elsewhere, is that they almost always maintain a great, friendly atmosphere.  You are often treated like family--staff give you a warm welcome and genuinely appreciate your business.  Not here!  It is just rush, rush, rush from young, inexperienced wait staff and you almost feel like an intruder.  

I am unsure why this place is so busy.  You can get the same thing in at least a dozen other places within a couple of blocks.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ever since they took over the empty lot next door, the seating space in this formerly tiny restaurant has really expanded; this is incredibly useful, as it turned moderately long waiting times into a nearly warp speed wait time (yay). The service is quick, and the portions are gigantic - my lunch date and I ordered the kebob platter (4 pieces of meat, roasted tomatoes, pita, tzatziki, salad + side) and a chicken gyro lunch combo (chicken gyro, side + drink). Our leftovers could've fed an entire family. Taste wise, I wasn't blown away; I've had tastier chicken elsewhere on the Danforth, and their tzatziki wasn't as garlicky as I like. However, for speed, value and satiety, this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Sooo much food!! But it is truly delicious and they're very fast for pick up at lunch time. The servers could be a little more attentive during lunch though, or else everything is great!"}
{"text":"Messini has been my favorite restaurant for 10 years. It's my go to spot for groups and for whenever I have no plans. The food is great and affordable."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork gyro with fries and well as the spanakopita, the gyros were delicious and authentic, same way i had them in Athens and the spanakopita was also really good. Place was nice inside and well priced."}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant you expect it to be nice because of the aesthetic but as you walk further into the restaurant you can see that it's actually quite dirty and disorderly. the staff is not able to handle the busy rush of a Friday night, and although the food is cheap - it's quality is not the best. It's more of a place to just stop by and grab a bite to eat on the way home from work, otherwise not worth the journey."}
{"text":"We came here trying to branch out from our dependence on Alexandros. Come on, Messini's! One of our friends said he was sure he had picked the right rental when he heard a Messini's was opening up just around the corner. People love it!

We just walked in on a weekday earlier this summer and there was no line-up. That said, the patio was open, so the place would probably be full in the winter.

We really, really liked the baked Greek chips. We liked the chip fries instead of straight fries, and we loved the baked texture. If you're two people, just order one. I wish the waitress was brave enough to warn us we were ordering waaaaaaay too much food. They gave us a box to take home. I enjoyed the fries inside the pita. Fun. 

The prices were pretty good. Service was friendly and nice. The place is kind of dated, but that's not a big deal (especially considering our preferred option is Alexandros). You're not paying for the decor here.

But we couldn't get over our pork gyros. The meat was dry, maybe too lean, and too charred in a few places. The portions were comically enormous, but considering we weren't that into our gyros, the amount actually turned into a negative."}
{"text":"Enfin un vrai grec, qui a vraiment le gout de mouton, il m'aura fallut faire 5000km pour y gouter! Maintenant je me demande ce que je pouvais bien manger en France dans mes grecs!!

Enfin bref, l'endroit est super, il y a toujours du monde donc patientez un peu pour vous voir attribuer une place, mais pas longtemps, maxi 30 min! mais vous ne le regretterez pas!"}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy this place. SO and I usually get their combo deal, you get 2 wraps, app to share and a salad. 
$1 up charge for Greek fries, worth it!
Their feta is delicious. They also expanded, so now there's a bigger seating area and less people loitering. 

Comes up to less than $20 for both. Parking is limited though... usually we park on the side streets but there's stipulations on most days, weekends are more lenient but difficult to find. 

After a meal here, you can grab some dessert from Demetres! If you aren't too full already, of course."}
{"text":"The bestttttt for food and prices. 

I always get the calamari and port gyro. The portions are huge and the taste is amazing. 

Usually dinner for 2 will cost $30 with drinks. 

Open late on weekends which is a bonus for that area."}
{"text":"Greek fries, grilled calamari, chicken gyro...and you're done. Awesome food and awesome prices. Try to go during non peak hours as it gets busy!"}
{"text":"We came in at around 8:35 pm in the evening, the place was moderately packed so we had to wait about 5-10(?) mins for a table. When we finally got seated it seemed that the rush of diners followed us. It was PACKED. Our waitress was nice however we felt a bit neglected throughout our dinner and had so much trouble flagging her down to adjust things on our bill.

First she forgot to add our second chicken pita, so one came and nothing after that.
We ordered 2 grilled chicken pita, Greek fries, Greek salad and an extra side of roasted potatoes.

-They also gave us complimentary pita bread with Olive spread. The spread was very good- only if you don't mind olives. It's very strong.

-The Greek fries was very delicious, would order again.

-Greek salad did not have any lettuce, is this how it is traditionally? Not sure. But was still good.

-Roasted potatoes were huge. Not sure what kind of potatoes they use but they were gigantic.

When we were ready to pay for our bill it seemed no one could stop to even look around it was GO GO GO. We flagged down another waitress and she told a waiter in that section but he just yelled back at her \"IT'S NOT MY SECTION\". I don't know what the break downs of only helping their sections being very strict but we found that a turn off. It was basically saying \"I don't care what the customer is asking it's not my job so leave me alone\" that attitude really stinks.

Finally after getting our bill, it took another 10 mins to flag our waitress down to let her know there was an error which took another 15 mins for her to fix that error and finally we got to leave.

Not sure if we'd be back for dine in...but I think take out is the way to go if we come back."}
{"text":"Deep fries calamari is great, gyro is avarage. Desert menu must be added. Stuff are great"}
{"text":"The gyros are nicely stuffed and look beautiful, but honestly I've had better at takeout places. Not to say that Messini's aren't good, but it didn't quite fulfill my high expectations. The environment is very lively though, and the place is well-decorated. Service doesn't leave anything to be desired."}
{"text":"AMAZING! CHEAP! Go here. Those two adjectives are all that's required and I'm sure you'll agree with me once you try it out.

Cheers"}
{"text":"The first thing we noticed about this place was how packed it was. It was a Thursday night at 11pm - about  an hour 'til closing. You know a restaurant must be doing something right when it's full of people and there's still a good line waiting to be seated or waiting for their  takeout. We ordered the chicken gyros and the pork gyros. I was expecting to pay at least $20 but, for the two, it cost $9.50. Definitely a great deal. The gyros themselves were okay - I was surprised and excited to find fries in them! The gyros are full and big but both gyros lacked sauce. Lots of meat but they were super dry. Which made me want to stop eating them before I got full. Also - the seasoning on the chicken is a lot better than on the pork. 

That being said, I think I'll have to give the place another chance and hope that their quality is better. If a lot of people eat here, I'm missing something. Plus - all the orders that came past me as I waited for my takeout looked delicious and worth the prices you'd pay for them. Their feta fries looked really good. Maybe our food wasn't as great because we came later in the night and the place was packed? Although they should have better quality control by now... guess I'll just have to go in and dine-in sometime."}
{"text":"Great spot! I love their food!
Their sandwiches, salads, fries are all great.
My favourite side dishes are the grilled octopus and calamari.
Their service is always good and relatively fast.

My only recommendation being a greek restaurant is to add vine leaves on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Came here with friends after they raved about the food here, but I wasn't a fan. 

The only two things that would warrant a potential return are the dirt cheap prices and the greek fries. 

The majority of the menu is well under $10 which is probably. the main factor of their popularity. 

I had the vegetarian pita, spanakopita, and shared the greek fries. 

The spanakopita had barely any spinach or flavor, and tasted like it had been sitting out all day and the microwaved when ordered.

The vegetarian pita was also flavorless and very dry. The vegetables inside tasted fresh, but the bread and the french fries inside it did not. 

The greek fries however were pretty good, baked and surprisingly flavorful potatoes with a heaping pile of feta. 

If you're considering Messini, I'd urge you to reconsider and visit one of the many places in Greektown for more authentic and better greek food"}
{"text":"Owned by Lionel Messini of Barcelona and Argentina.

This place deserves Zero Stars! Nah, nah, I'm not serious, I'm just Messini around. It's actually one of the best Gyros in Canada, and everyone should give it a try. Woefully underrated place.

What to get: Beef-and-lamb Gyro (Chicago Style) or authentic Pork Gyro. Better yet, get both.
What else: Come during the Danforth St Festival if you want to wait in line outside for your Gyro for about 47 minutes (minimum).

I'm a mega fan of Gyros and a big connoisseur of them, right down to the point that I can actually spell the word connoisseur. Sometimes.

Messini deserves much higher ratings than it has. OK the service is hit or miss, but come on. I'm not sure if it's pricey to eat in, or if people hate the wait times during the festival, but let's see:

(1) They have both Chicago style and authentic Athens pork-style Gyros
(2) Both are piping hot and juicy and fresh
(3) The pitas and sauces taste great
(4) Both types of Gyro meat are amaaaaaaaaaaaazing
(5) By Toronto standards, both Gyros are fairly affordable

I'm not sure how Messini can score less than a 5 if you come for the Gyro. Easily the best I've had in Canada and one of the best Gyros (of both kinds) in North America. The highlight of Danforth St (along with the amazing Creme Brulee donuts at Von and the insanely perfect Loukamades at Athens Pastries, both of which must be tried to be believed).

Anyone who is in Toronto and likes Gyros simply must try both kinds from Messini. They're pretty juicy so be careful not to make a Messini of yourself.

I think I'll go there tonight. I'm wearing fishnet though, so I feel a bit Mesh-ini. I'm also a little manic today, so I first need to take my Meds-ini. I remind myself of a painting in the MET-ini. If they're closed, then we can go for Tex Mex-ini. Over a bowl of nachos, I'll tell you that you're the sexiest person I've ever Met-ini. It'll make you Melt-ini. Then we'll skip the bedroom activities and go watch the Bluejays beat the Mets-ini because WHAT WOMAN DOESN'T LOVE BASEBALL.

Nah I'm not a baseball fan I was just Messini around again."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here last year was pretty good.  I ordered a lamb gyro and Greek fries.  The gyro was good but had way too many onions, and the fries were so perfect!  Such a great yet basic recipe. 

The second time I visited a few months ago, the chicken gyro wrap (no onions) was fantastic, but the feta cheese on the Greek fries was burnt. I'm talking like literally black and charred. I threw them in the garbage. 

Just a few nights ago I went for the final time.  My boyfriend and I shared Greek fries and roasted potatoes.  When we took the containers out of the bag, grease spilled everywhere. Our pants and his car seats are stained with grease.  The Greek fries weren't very good and the roasted potatoes were so bland, the only thing I could taste was oil."}
{"text":"Really good pork souvlaki sticks! Messini would be perfect for some drunk food (too bad it doesn't close at later times). Service was a bit slow since it was pretty packed when we came in for a visit. Other than that, I would be down for coming back again and try out their delicious-looking pita gyros!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant, great atmosphere and most importantly great food, but unfortunately service could use some improvement.
This is my fourth visit to this place and service is always on the slow side regardless on how busy the restaurant is. 
I have spotted an inappropriate act between the manager and the server (the manager was yelling at poor guy using inappropriate words) which is definitely unacceptable at any restaurant standards.
The food on the other hand is amazing. But service!! Come on!!
Staff isn't that friendly or professional, the four or five servers we dealt with were all on the younger side of age, no experience what so ever."}

{"text":"The Gyros are simply amazing but the service is simply awful.
I weigh the quality of food more than the service for rating purposes and many might
give a three or less because of bad service but I morally can not.  Endure the lousy service and concentrate on the great food.  It is worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"The two stars is only for our nice waiter. Horrible food, crowded loud atmosphere. Our meal came with literally 5 tiny pieces of meat, bunch of lettuce, one tomato and a whole lotta pita.

I rather stay home and dunk grocery pita sauce and call it a meal."}
{"text":"Been here a few times several years ago and found the food and service to be ok. Was in the neighbourhood recently so figured I'd stop by. Big mistake.

There was a long lineup but we were able to get a seat within 15 minutes. After we were seated it took 20 minutes before anyone even came to check on us and take our order. Our server then brought our drinks and that was it. We waited over 40 minutes for our food (which never came btw) while watching other tables who were seated after we ordered get their orders and practically finishing it. There wasn't even an apology after we let the waiter know about the long wait.

Needless to say we will not be back there are better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I was craving such a delicious experience from this place and it was about 20 minutes drive from where I live.  I decided to go based on all the positive reviews on yelp- WOW, WAS I DISAPPOINTED!

Gyros: I had the real deal in Greece back in 09 (with the fries in them) and have been searching for that deliciousness in Toronto ever since. 

I'm a lamb fanatic and lamb will always trump most meats on the menu for me- so I   called ahead to place my order, 1 lamb gyro and 1 Greek fries. I'm not sure if that was my mistake getting the lamb but to keep a long story short. It was awful!! The actual meat was disgusting- it caught me so off guard because this place had amazing reviews and they had a 5 person line-up at 1am. Clearly ppl like their food? 

Greek fries were actually really good. Maybe I got a bad batch of lamb or maybe the (lamb) meat has gone bad. Whatever the reason is- it was nasty.. I threw out my gyro after 3 bites (1st bite: excited - 2nd bite: disappointed - 3rd bite: disgusted)

I need some time before I start craving lamb again."}
{"text":"Delicious Gyros.  This is probably the best in Toronto.  A got to go and try it.  This place is packed so eating inside might be a problem.  Take out is a problem only because it is messy to eat.  Find a place to sit and enjoy."}
{"text":"Messini was always my go-to place for Greek food, until a rather unfortunate experience I had tonight. It was pretty busy for a Sunday night when my boyfriend and I walked in for some takeout. We placed an order for a chicken gyro, veggie pita, Greek fries and a salad. After about 15 minutes one of the kitchen guys asked us what we ordered and assured us it would be ready in a few minutes. We watched several people who ordered well after we did (and the same items too) get their food when our order was nowhere in sight. They also ran out of green peppers (used for Greek salad and veggie pita) which was a big disappointment. We patiently waited over 45 minutes and finally gave up when what should have been our order of Greek fries, were given to someone else who ordered about 20 minutes after we did. We asked for a refund and got one but there was no apology, no complimentary food, no explanation for the long wait time. After all that, we walked out with no food after making a special trip out for Messini. 

The food here is good and inexpensive, but the service is lacking. We used to come here regularly, but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for Gyros.  It is the only place that I know of in Toronto that makes Gyros exactly like you would get in Athens!   IN the gyros, they put in French fires...exactly like they do in Greece.

Very good quality Gyros and Greek Fries!

The alcoholic drinks were very cheap (Beer $3.95) compared to places that charge double across the street.

We will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"pretty good gyros with deals similar to \"two can dine\" two gyros and fries the last time I was here. they also stuffed fries into the gyros. tends to get busy"}
{"text":"I was surprised to see so many negative reviews on this place because my boyfriend and I had a really good time here! It was a spontaneous trip to Greek town, so we had no idea which place is the best in that area. Messini was so packed compared to other restaurants at that time (Sunday at around 7pm). There were people waiting for take-outs and the dining area was also packed. 

The highlight of that meal was complimentary greek salad! A medium size bowl per person (I assume only if you order a platter?) made with crisp, fresh veggies and a generous amount of feta cheese! We were already full by the time we finished salad and pita bread with olive paste. The main dish... with potato on the side.... was MASSIVE. It could easily feed two people, and with the complimentary appetizer, the entire meal can feed three people. So guess how much food we had to take home! We got two platters just for two of us. 

Overall, service was quick, solid food, and HUGE portions! Now I know it is a crazy idea to order two platters for two people."}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL. I went there last night with three friends who said good things about it and we had the most horrible service ever.

We were seated and waited sooooo long for a server to come to us. One of my friends actually had to flag him down and he came to us a few minutes later. He didn't say \"My name is so and so and I'll be taking care of you\" like servers usually do.

We finally placed our orders and waited and waited and waited. We were there for about 40 minutes all we had was water and one of my friends had something she ordered BUT they did not bring her tzatziki sauce which she was waiting for before she would eat it.

We told another waiter that we have been waiting for a while and he said he would check on things but he was not sympathetic at all. His attitude was careless.

We were so fed up that one of my friends spoke to the manager. He sucked. He was not interested in what we had to say. He plastered on his fake smile and tried to act like he was our friend and he was trying to do all the talking. Just shut up!!! He said he would go check on our food.

The food came a short time later but frankly the attitude of the manager made us not want to spend our money there. Once again my friend tried to speak to the manager. The manager was acting like everything was okay now and was tapping my friend on the shoulder and trying to walk away before my friend finished talking.

My friend said that our food should be free considering the situation or we're not eating. The manager's fake smile quickly disappeared and his hands quickly removed the plates from our tables before we even got up.

DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!

I resent the fact that I have to rate this place a minimum of one star. One star is far too good for this shit-hole.

I have lived in Toronto all my life and never been to the Danforth. Yesterday was my first and last time.

There is seriously nothing there worth seeing. I don't understand how Taste of the Danforth exists. The place is not crawling with Greek restaurants like I thought.

This is why I fucking hate the east end of this city.

I just saw that someone got stabbed at Midland and DANFORTH last night.

HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!

That street should just burn down. It is a disgrace."}
{"text":"Would you like some food with your salt & MSG?  Went in late on a Friday.   Seems they were unhappy to have customers that late even, although they're open till \"1am\" supposedly.  80% of the menu was unavailable.   The food we did get was lousy, overdone meat oozing with salt.  Pretty much all you can taste was salt. 

Server was extremely rude as well.  Would only recommend to enemies.  Pretty much the worst greek food establishment in tdot.  They should be banned from danforth."}
{"text":"The only Greek place that knows how to do it right. I'll just say this, coming from north GTA, we would drive all the way to Messinis just to get a gyro. 
Their lamb is also one of the better I've had from restaurants - smells good and has no nasty aftertaste (if cooked wrong, it stinks and leaves weird taste for a while) but not Messinis! Theirs is perfect every time. We've been coming for years, hope they don't change"}
{"text":"Probably the best bang for your buck I've found. only $ 5.50. for a chicken gyro. 

Really filling and great taste. They put tons of food in this wrap.

This place gets pretty busy though. So plan for a bit of a wait time."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Messini by my parents. They purchased a chicken wrap for me with fries in it. The taste was out of this world, I had never tasted anything like it. I was impressed, we did take out for three nights straight. 
Being price conscious, my only concern is, naturally, the price. The price per sandwich is a bit over inflated, they don't offer a deal if you purchase more than one. For that reason, I wont make coming here a regular thing, but I think on occasion its good."}
{"text":"I have updated this review to a 5 star.  Why? There isn't a gyro better in the city.  I have tried many places and I keep coming back here.  Now I'm craving another gyro :)"}
{"text":"Im shocked to see these positive reviews here. By far the worst Greek food ive ever tried. Nothing had salt. The bread was rock hard.  we had the meat platter, i cant tell you which one was worse. Everything was dry, kinda burnt and saltless. Servers were ok, but looked very miserable.  Im not greek, but ive worked in greek restaurants before, believe me this is not what good greek food tastes like.  I hope im wrong, or may be it was my luck. But man, we were very disappointed.  how is this place even open. Smelly washrooms, and we had a fly chilling with us at our table. I have pics to prove.lol."}
{"text":"I visited Messini for the first time a few years back during a \"Taste of Danforth\" celebration. I think most people who are familiar with Greektown already knows this, but Messini is kind of a really big deal.

Last time I visited Messini was on a Saturday evening. A friend and I were just looking to get a quick bite to eat on-the-go before a concert, and thought that this place would fit the bill nicely. The place was absolutely full to the brim with hungry customers. To complete our rather simple order of two chicken gyros, we waited approx. 25 minutes. I expect that if we wanted a table for our meal, we would have had to wait twice as long. If you're planning to visit this place during peak hours, make sure you have something to keep you occupied. A good book or a long overdue catch-up conversation with an old friend, perhaps.

The gyros themselves were fantastic and absolutely worth the wait. Messini's signature trademark is the addition of french fries on their gyros, and to be completely frank, I'm surprised more Greek places around the Danforth haven't followed suit. The fries go together perfectly with the hunks of grilled chicken and the hearty tzatziki sauce. Every time I go to Messini, I tell myself, \"this time, I'm going to try something different on the menu\". However, the second I walk through those doors, I know I'm going straight for that classic chicken gyro.

Don't settle for those $1.69 value menu McDonald's burgers ext time you're on the Danforth looking for a quick bite. Treat yourself to some Messini. I promise you; it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best place for delicious cheap eats on the Danforth. 
There are a lot of Greek restaurants on this strip and for me this is the best. 
I recommend the Greek fries and the Chicken Souvlaki pita.
It had french fries inside. Delicious!! I always ask for extra tzatziki because I love theirs."}
{"text":"Supposed to be the best Greek restaurant in Toronto... I'd say the best meat for sure! But the rest is average, like any regular Greek place and not even a bit above!  

The service is not great but they're well known now so they don't need it. I guess. 
I ll be back for a gyros pita,which is really good for a decent price. I'd take to go. 
But not sure if the place deserves the title of \"best of Toronto\"!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this spot on the Danforth for Greek food. Greek fries are amazing! Great prices and selection. The place can get very packed so be prepared to wait in a line for a bit."}
{"text":"Today, I went here for lunch around 2pm with some friends and we were greeted and seated immediately. As soon as I looked at the menu, nothing was over $15! The lunch specials were pretty much under $10 and also included side dishes of mashed potatoes, rice or a salad AND soda! We ordered the Greek fries, chicken stick, pork gyro pita, and salad. The food took quite abit of time to come to our table. 

The first item to come was the greek fries which were AMAZING!! So much feta cheese came with the fries and it tasted like a poutine -drools-! Then, one of our side dishes came by itself (potatoes). It took another 15 minutes for everyone's food to come out and it turned out I ate my friends side dish and my chicken stick had my potatoes on it! The service was just okay, we would've had preferred the food all coming at the same time. We all enjoyed the food, other than the service.

Tl;Dr service is meh, food is amazing and cheap. Would come again for sure"}
{"text":"Greek food on the Danforth can be really hit and miss.  Often miss.  In the last year I've had Greek on the Danforth three times.  One absolutely terrible, one okay and one very good.  Very good goes to Messini.  I can't add much more than the other reviewers.  Greek french fries are definitely a must have.  So delicious.  I had the gyro plate, but I think that the gyro on a pita would have been a better bet.  Greek salad was good and the meat platter was excellent (I didn't eat *all* of this, but rather shared dishes with a friend).  The only hiccup was a waitress at the beginning.  Two of us sat down and were given one menu.  I asked a waitress for a second menu and she looked stunned.  A momentary shocked expression that seemed to say \"Why in the world would two people need two menus?????\"  She actually froze for a moment, like a deer in headlights.  We got our second menu.  I don't think that was asking too much.  That aside, Messini is *by far* the best Greek food I've had on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Will definitely return. Recommend. 

This is not a fine dining place and doesn't deserve to be rated as such. This is where you go for bomb Greek food in the heart of Greektown!

I came here with a few buddies and was promised good Greek food served up on huge portions. That was exactly what I got. 

I ordered a Pork Souvlaki wrap dinner with Fries. Add $2 for a double portion check. Add $1 for feta cheese on my fries check. Best two decisions I made that day.

The dinner $16+tx+tip came with an authentic Greek salad LOADED with Feta, fresh cucumbers, red onion as a starter. For my side of fries they plated a huge portion of home fries hidden beneath a mound yet again of their fresh, awesome feta cheese and seasoning. Deliciousss - great to share but I didn't.  For the main meal, they served up 2 identical mouthwatering wraps - lots of fresh Souvlakis, Tzatziki, veggies and fries to boot. Eat one and take the other home for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Messini a hit with the locals -- always busy and bustling. That's when you know you can rely on great food and atmosphere. It's a great in-and-out spot in Greek town.

Price: Very reasonable and affordable.

Messini doesn't skimp on the feta -- they are generously sprinkled over salads and baked on top over fries which is the Grecian way. 

Must-have(s): 
- Any gyro combo stuffed with fries
- Fries with baked feta on top
- Fresh, warm pita slices with olive paste for spreading/dipping
- Greek salad

Service: Friendly, quick, attentive and very accommodating. 

They don't \"mess-ini\" with your gyros here! Messini will guarantee a great meal every time."}
{"text":"Awful. Stay away. Not only did my food come out after waiting more than 60 minutes and seeing all the tables that were seated after us get their food before us, but when I asked the server about it, she didn't seem to know anything or care. She said she was going to get us a discount but she didn't and she even had the nerve to charge us for an appetizer we never received! The food was also mediocre. I don't know why this place was so busy with such awful service and boring meals. Oh and they forgot our fries until again, I had to remind our server that something was missing. One of the worst dining experiences I've had in Toronto yet. Shame on the server and the manager for being so apathetic. Even the table next to us commented on how awful our experience was. Lol."}
{"text":"I was there recently and I had the WORST experience ever!!! The waitress was extremely rude, and when she wasn't rude  she completely ignored my table. It took her over 20 minutes to bring the machine for credit. When my friend d and I got up to leave, she was whispering to another waiter and they both were laughing at us. So disrespectful. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"superb and prompt service. was greeted and seated within 2 minutes. sun shining through, lovely atmosphere and open concept. food to die for. highly recommend the Greek chips and lamb/beef combo gyro for 6.50+tax (they put fries inside woohoo!). hot sauce on request? heck ya

One star off because I didn't enjoy the grilled calamari...a bit too thick and rubbery for my taste and no seafood sauce available."}
{"text":"Pro - The best Gyros I've had in TO by a VERY large margin

Con - Not the best \"all around\" Greek food in TO"}
{"text":"What I like about here is that if you want Greek food, you just need to take a stroll down Danforth and literally close your eyes, turn around in circles with your finger pointed and when you stop, go into that Greek restaurant. I don't think I've hit up a bad Greek restaurant on Danforth yet. I mean, some are better than others but the food is still fantastic. I do like how Messini has an outdoor patio. Bring a girl here in the fall at sunset, a nice breeze, a good bottle of red, delicious Greek food. Not bad.

Ever since trying the fish of the day at multiple Greek restaurants, I have never been disappointed. However, I was not able to get this option at Messini's on the day that I came. 

The grilled Kalamari has now become a fan favorite appetizer and it still has not changed coming here. So since I couldn't any fresh fish dish, I settled with the mixed grill platter. I was seriously thinking of going with the calamari platter but I didn't need to have an appetizer and a main course of the same thing so why not change it up. And plus, the picture in the menu made it look so appetizing. Well. Not gonna lie, it did not disappoint. Never was a big fan of the way the Greek people cooked their potatoes so I settled with the rice which when mixed with everything, was delicious.

If I ever start twirling around with my finger extended and stop on this restaurant, I will be more than happy to enter knowing that I can get some good Greek food."}
{"text":"My bf had been talking about this place for as long as ive known him and he hadnt even been there before. Word on the block was this was the spot for gyros, and the block was right. We finally made it in here last week and was stuffed to brim!! We ordered 2 chicken gyros and greek fries. Both came with a side so we got salads cause fries would have been too much, especially cause they put fries IN your gyro lol. The salad was large and the grek fries were even larger covered in feta cheese!! soo frikkin good......and the gyro is actualy WICKED! like delish delish delish. The tzatziki was redick and the chicken was juicy...yumzz!

Def go here, dont skip out!!"}
{"text":"Can I give 3.5 stars here?
We were here last night.  The crowd fave appears to be a gyro in a pita.  it comes with fries right in the pita.  I wish I had ordered it.
I ordered the pork souvlaki skewer dinner.  The greek salad doesn't have lettuce, but it's super delicious.  The tzatziki sauce is super duper garlicky.  I also had the spinach pie.
It was pretty tasty.  The pork was a bit dry for pork, but way less dry than the chicken skewer that my friend ordered.

This place is super loud.  And really busy.  Next time I'm getting the pita."}
{"text":"Went in last night for a friend's birthday. Were told the wait would be about 40 mins. It wasn't that which was great. 

Sadly that is where the greatness ended.

Same as previous comments, felt very rushed to take orders.  Server disbt get a single drink order to the proper person qhwn they came. Which i guess was a red flag.

Took for ever to bring salads. 2 of the 6 received their salads 10 minutes before the rest of the group. The salad and Greek fries were good. Souvlaki was dry and cold once it arrived. The rice and potatoes were very bland. A friend that had arrived late and ordered after everyone else received her food a good 5 minutes before the rest of the table.

Come time for the bill we had requested separate bills which seemed to be forgotten during the evening as we had multiple servers. They needed the bills clarified which was fine but then the second server we had came to clarify the bills again. 

Once everything was accurate took even longer to pay the bills. Mid our table paying they took the debit machine and had 2 other tables pay before the server wandered around with it before bringing it off. 

Sadly, we were super excited for this dinner and were grossly underwhelmed. 

Definitely will not try this place again"}
{"text":"Bad gyro with bad customer service rather spend my money some where else. The guy at cash was a piece of crap."}
{"text":"I REALLY like Messini for take-out but not so much for dine-in.  Therefore, I'm giving it 3 stars to reflect both.

I work in the area, and Messini offers some pretty awesome Souvlakis.  Please keep in mind that the restaurant is very inaccessible and the bathrooms are gendered.  There are no real options for vegans here, other than having grilled vegetables on a pita with no sauce.

However, first off, for those of you NOT from Toronto, Souvlakis in Toronto may be different to what you're used to.  The pita used is very thick and spongy, different from the thinner style I am used to.  Also, for some reason, in Toronto many Souvlakis contain French Fries.  I know some people find this off-putting.

I used to go to Messini's to pick up lunch a lot.  Their chicken souvlakis are very reasonably priced AND unlike Louis', they offer vegetarian souvlakis with grilled vegetables.  I love those.  In fact, I love them so much I brought my partner for lunch.  That did not go well.  

We were seated pretty quickly, but the restaurant as a whole seemed a little dirty.  It took a really long time to get a menu.  My partner and I both ordered lunch specials of Souvlakis with sides.  When our meal arrived, my partner was very unimpressed.

The potatoes that came on the side were COVERED in oil and were cold.  It was clear that they had been precooked and poorly reheated for our meals.  Our \"Greek salads\" didn't fair much better.  They barely contained condiments, and at first I genuinely wondered if the server had forgotten the cheese.  Also, the meals took forever to arrive, despite the restaurant not being busy.  My partner was VERY shocked by the whole french fry thing, since it's not mentioned on the menu and I forgot to tell him.  

Personally, I ate all my meal and I found my souvlaki great, but my sides so-so.  My partner asked me to never take him here again.  So that's that."}
{"text":"Really good value, especially for lunch.  Gyros, plate or sandwich, are solid, and you get Greek salad and a pop for a price in the low teens.  Rare, and really nice, to get so much food for a reasonable price in this city.  Gyros actually taste somewhat like in Greece, although they are better in Greece.  No sample sized proteins at exorbitant costs.  You can actually get your meat on here.  Please don't change."}
{"text":"Their seafood dishes are amazing and I love their Greek fries.  First time I came here, I had the Greek Surf and Turf, which was essentially four skewers of pork, chicken, shrimp, and calamari.  Food was quite salty, but other than that, everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying: the food was actually pretty good. And I also wanna thank the stuff for being so nice and friendly. 
Although I didn't like the menu so much: gyros and sandwiches for the most part, and not as much choice as I expected. It's okay I guess, but I expected it to be a little bit different I guess. Anyways we had a great time there!"}
{"text":"This place is solid. Always go here for their gyros. The grilled chicken off the grilled spiralling rack is my favourite. It's decently priced for the quality of food. About $5-6 for a gyro. I also always get the messini salad and sometimes I'll get their fries which comes with a lot of feta cheese on top. If you eat in, they also serve you pita bread with an olive spread which is delicious! Love this place."}
{"text":"Used to love it - great food in the restaurant, albeit rather aloof service, but also a good takeout place. 

Ordered a Chicken Gyro pita and Greek Fries the other evening, around 9:30. Got it home promptly, found the chicken in the pita was all the scraps that fell off during carving - dry, hard, tough little bits, not sliced nicely off the rotisserie. 

Greek fries - soggy wet fries under a heap of (otherwise very nice) feta, had been under grill based on burned edges of fries, but cheese had no color. Oregano thrown down into a small pile the size of a loonie. 

It's sad when a chef doesn't care about their work. Or a restaurant. 

Best part - tried to phone the order in - their mailbox is full - sign of a business on the way down. They closed the Eglinton location recently, not surprised, was not very good, and seems like the whole venture has jumped the shark. I guess I won't bother calling to complain LOL. 

1 Star for old time's sake."}
{"text":"Straight up, this is the best comfort/drunk food you will ever have. 

I've gone countless times and get the combo, which is at the back of the menu. You get 2 gyros, Greek fries and Greek salad for ~ $14.  

They're massive portions and the taste is just perfect."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite spot to hit for gyros on danforth, but after a recent visit, I was super disappointed. We ordered chicken gyros and a Greek fries. The fries felt old and I had to ask the fries to be reheated up twice. The chicken in the gyro were dry as well. Super disappointed"}
{"text":"Awesome prices and good tasting gyros but don't go for dining in. The service sucks and the wait is extremely long. Go here for take out!"}
{"text":"Never really had \"real\" greek food but this place was really good.  Fresh meat, very tasty.  Pitas were very fresh and delicious.  Only issue i had was very slow service.  We waited 25 min just for a check and they forgot our appetizer. Other than that, id go back next time im in toronto"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The host is terrible at organizing waiters. \"Just line up against the wall\". Ok do you need a name do we take a number? Don't know about the food; didn't want to wait after that experience. It's chaotic. 40 minute plus wait for gyros?? No thanks. I'll go to the competition."}
{"text":"cheap gyros that taste great! fast service and with the new renovation the place looks good too. highly recommended if you like Greek food."}
{"text":"Ever since we went to Greece and pretty much OD'd on gyros daily as they were so cheap, so good, and had french fries on them, I've looked for a place that would offer gyros with french fries on them.

In Ottawa, you are out of luck.  (At least I haven't heard of any place that does it).

In Montreal, (as we have friends that are Greek who live there), as far as I know as well you are out of luck.

Ah, but in Greek Town in Toronto?  Yes, you can have them.  That alone will make we want to go back to this area.

FOOD

So, as you can guess, I ordered their gyros (actually I ordered pork souvlaki on a pita).  Five of us actually ordered their pita sandwiches and all of us really, really enjoyed them.  The sandwiches are quite large, the meat tasty, and yes, the french fries.  Granted, the type of french fries they used wouldn't be my first choice, but I'm still glad they had them.

Even before the sandwich, we started with a greek salad (which comes with the lunch special) with a tasty type of feta cheese (which we also can't seem to get in Ottawa).

Let's just say we ate everything and had to roll out of there promising to go back.

SERVICE

Service was a little slow.  It took quite a while to get our food despite a pretty fast revolving line for take-outs so I guess the take-out orders get priority?  Once we got our bill, we just went to the cash to save time waiting for the server to come to us.

PRICE

From a lunch time special at least, $10 each for a salad, sandwich and drink was very, very affordable given the quality and quantity of food.

OTHER

I guess the locals know this but if you are from out of town, Danforth is a busy street.  Parking here seems to be like winning the lottery and there are a lot of one-way streets around so if you see a spot, grab it and walk to save some aggravation.

--

This is definitely a place I would recommend and return to.  No questions asked.

Only suggestion may be to order take-out if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Great Greek food! My husband and I had lunch here as we were on vacation and wanted to check out the neighborhood. However a lot of shops were closed probably because of Canada Day Monday. T
We were recommended another restaurant on the strip but it was just setting up to open and as we passed Messini we walked in checked out the menu and the nearby customers and their overflowing plates of food. We decided to come here instead and boy were we glad. The food is terrific and plentiful. The waitress forewarned us that the lamb is a little fatty but it wasn't that bad. I had gyro pita and he had the platter. Gyro had fries in it that I thought was unusual. Service was slightly slow but the food made up for it. Vey enjoyable meal well worth the travel to this neighborhood as there is not much else there."}
{"text":"You simply must have the greek fries they are the best. We have been many times when visiting Toronto and are never disappointed. The gyros are very big and so filling we can never finish them. You might have to wait for a seat because every time I have been here it is really busy but totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Nice place to try Greek food I will say. They donot have the best raps but they are cheap the raps are ok they put fries in them which is unique but the quality is not as good. They best is the Greek fries and posted potato these are my favorite I will recoment people to try them. The beer is good when u get it in a place like kurta style I will recoment that. I like the place and been coming for some time"}
{"text":"Great place for Greek food.

I'm particularly fond of their octopus and their gyros pizza, but their salads, Greek fries, and most of their appetizers are all good too. A meal for 4 people here is something like $50, I've come here and its been $16 to stuff 2 people!

The tzatziki is good, but I'm not a fan of the gyros, Louis meat market (right next door, to the east) is infinitely better, and slightly cheaper. However messini is an actual restaurant where Louis meat market is a butcher shop with a few tables. something about the gyros here taste funny although the gyros meat is the real stacked meat here (I can't stand that gyros sausage bullshit)

their pita is also slightly disappointing, you get very little bread when you order the pita, but I LOVE the mashed olives it comes with, see the little black sauce in the picture.

The atmosphere is nice in messini, if a little crowded, I've come here at 3 pm on a Monday and the line has still been out the door. Don't even think about it on a Saturday night or something. They're open fairly late too. Most of the time I don't even bother because there are so many other places to get food without waiting 30 minutes.

a great place, but please don't come here, it's already too crowded ;)"}
{"text":"Decent greek fast-food - this satisfies your comfort food craving. Don't expect to save on calories here."}
{"text":"By Far the Best Place for Greek Food in Town! I feel like I'm eating at my own kitchen table! I feel at Home there! The Staff is Amazing at The Atmosphere is Loud and so European!
I will recommend Messinis to EVERYONE! 
I recommend my Usual! 2 Gyros w/Greek Fries! 
DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place, especially people who live outside The Danforth/GreekTown, but it is pretty average compared to the overall quality of Greek Cuisine in Toronto and authentic Greek food (in Greece).

Kudos for their completely authentic Greek-style gyros, with the pommes-frittes inside the pita! However, the pita is too thick, and the meat inside is not much.  The ambiance could be better.  And their other food, except the gyros, is downright average.  The price is right, but not super low. 

There are plenty of places on the Danforth that are better than Messini's, both as food quality and authenticity, and ambiance. IMHO (in my humble opinion) as someone whose roots hail from the region and who has lived in Athens (Kiffisia) for a little while."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill a bit since the expansion.

Came here on Friday, and noticed they consumed the store next to them to become two times bigger. That is a bonus, since this place is almost always packed. 

The food wasn't as flavourful and good as it used to be. Fiance and I shared the combo platter, and got the chicken gyros pita. The gyros was really bland.. I couldn't taste much. And I've had it before, where it blew my mind. The salad and greek fries were good, as usual. The fries were a bit burned.. 

The drink menu offers Coke products, but they only carried Pepsi products.. ugh, please update your menu. It's the small things that bother me.

Service was quick, but felt like we were being rushed out. I still had food in my mouth when the bill came.

This last experience wasn't a great one. But it still is decent food at a decent price."}
{"text":"I love Messinis. Great portions, great food, great prices. I have been a loyal takeout customer to both locations, so I decided to try dine in.

My dine in experience was absolutely not something to be happy about. I ordered a chicken gyro pita, no onions, due to a sensitivity I have. And guess what? There were onions! So I let my server know, and she was completely unapologetic. Not even a sorry. Just an, \"Oh there's onions?\"..... luckily I am not allergic to them (they just make my stomach upset) so I ate my wrap with a fork picking out my onions along the way, which really ruins your meal. Not to mention there was one other couple in the restaurant and I waited 20 minutes for my bill. Not impressed, will be doing takeout, as they seem to get it right every time."}
{"text":"Normally at 2:30 in the afternoon, that awkward time between lunch and dinner, a restaurant look like a ghost town, if it's open at all.  Not Messini's...we walked in at 2:30 to a small wait for a table.  That's a promising sign.

This restaurant is a gyro restaurant--plain and simple--it's even in their name.  They do pork, chicken, and lamb.  On this visit, I went with the lamb.  It's none of that manufactured garbage that looks like it was made with a trash compactor in a factory; this lamb tastes like lamb, with all the flavor (and the fat) that comes with it.  Generally quite rich and tasty with the nicely garlicky tzatziki layering over the top.  The Greek salad I got in the lunch combo was fairly good, although it does not hold a candle to the lush Greek salads I still fantasize about from my time in the country.  Somehow, they never taste the same here, and in this case it's the quality of the feta and the olive oil that lead the let-down.

The service was lackluster but friendly enough.  Forget ketchup or a beverage refill.  Actually, forget even having someone offer to bring you the check.  Oh well, you're here for the food anyway.  

Overall, no one will mistake this place for fine dining, but for relatively quick-service gyro, this is pretty tough to beat."}
{"text":"Appears to be popular for sit-down lunch. Many lunch specials plates revolving around either gyros or souvlaki, with salad and soft drink (fountain), reasonably priced 9-12$ plus tax and service. Had the lamb gyros plate for lunch: the lamb gyros, like any other served here, was HUGE - a thick pita filled with fries, tzaziki sauce, tomatoes, onions (all dressed). The meat quality wasn't great- lots of fatty pieces of meat that I had to take out, and the meat that wasn't fatty was very oily and appeared to have been deep-fried (!). The meal started with a huge greek salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, green peppers), lots of feta cheese. Came accompanied with grilled pita served with a greek olive tapenade. The salad was OK, since the tomatoes weren't quite ripe, but the feta was great. could not judge whether olive oil was used as dressing.. Overall, I'd say go here if you are very hungry and are looking for a budget meal that will fill you up, but are looking for average quality! A few construction workers were lunching here, I can see how this would be a perfect lunch spot for hungry guys!"}
{"text":"Fantastic gyros and Greek fries. 

Quick service, quality food and just a great experience overall."}
{"text":"Had the kebab plate, which come with fries and salad, and a pork gyro pita.

Fries and salad came RIGHT AWAY.

Waited 25 mins for the kebab plate, ate that with the now-cold fries that came 25 mins earlier.

Kebab meat was four pieces of dry meat in the shape of turds. Dry, not flavorful. Regretted ordering it.

Pork gyro was ok but was 80% carbs, barely any meat. And the meat wasn't that good. Dry and greasy."}
{"text":"25 dollars for a kebab plate and two sides - Greek fries and Greek salad. Could easily feed two people. My first authentic Greek food experience and it did not disappoint. The kebab meat was amazingly seasoned, juicy and tasteful. The feta cheese was the obvious standout with the salad and the Greek fries! The atmosphere is great and the staff is friendly and very welcoming. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love gyros and this is my favourite place so far! I usually go for the lamb but I've also tried the pork, and chicken. All are very good! The rotisseries are right by the front door, tempting you as you wait to be seated. Yes, it gets really busy so you may have to wait for a table. That's how popular Messini's is.

The calamari and souvlaki (pork or chicken) are also excellent. Their feta cheese is the creamiest and best tasting that I've had, unlike the dry crumbly variety served at most places. Order the Greek fries, topped with feta, olive oil, and oregano. Everything I've tried has been very tasty. Portions are very generous.

Service has been hit or miss. Maybe because they're always busy? The servers are mostly efficient but not necessarily the friendliest people around. Twice I've had incorrect orders brought to the table.

If you love Greek food, not just gyros, go to Messini's!"}
{"text":"A popular gyros joint in an area teeming with Greek options. I had the pork gyros and it came wrapped tightly in paper, making a bundle of deliciousness. They are generous with their fillings, with their meats being in sizable chunks versus being sliced down or flaky. The wrap itself is soft and chewy, holds up well to all the sauce and stuffing inside. There a coupke french fries to give it some crunch but it is mostly meat. Their Greek fries are great, the potatoes are cut into thin discs and loaded with a lot of feta cheese. Extra points for melting the top layer."}
{"text":"Okay seriously... DEN PAIZETAI ! Translation to English as \"nothing compares\". I'm Greek and I've been to Greece maybe 20+ times and I can tell you this place really does authentic gyros. This is as close as it gets to actually having a fresh gyro sandwich in Greece. Marinos (the owner) does it right. Chicken, pork, lamb... they're all cooked juuuust right. 

The menu is packed with an assortment of Greek cuisine but really go for a pita sandwich they're #1 in Toronto. The grilled octopus and grilled calamari (squid) dishes are also great. 

Would you like some Greek salad and Greek fries with that? Yes please :D"}
{"text":"I mean, how can you give a place that puts a french fries in a hand held edible masterpiece any less than 5 stars?  Okay, I will admit I am really reviewing the veggie pita these guys do as I've never eaten the gyros filled pitas.  I am told that their meat is really great especially 'cause they're so busy that they're always bringing a fresh spit out and the meat's not just sitting for days on end like your typical gyros and it's not the unidentifiable pate style but rather  hunks of meat that is layered onto the spit and than carved off and grilled. The veggie pita has exactly the same contents as the gyros filled one but with a little extra helping of their olive tapenade and grilled veg with lots of tzaziki.  I like heavy winter food and this is the ultimate hibernation meal! 

  The place is always pretty packed even during the week but there's never really a long wait despite the relatively small size of the dining room.  They've got a 2 pita and salad combo for $12.95 that more than sufficiently will feed two people as their servings are very welcoming.  I'm also a fan of their round, crinkle cut fries that are topped in feta...I know their just from frozen but their roundness somehow make 'em fun to eat....and then they're topped with cheese...(hey, I look at it as an excuse to take advantage of my dusty gym membership.)  

Oh yes, and always really fast and friendly service.  Fanopatastic!"}
{"text":"The chicken gyros were bland and overlooked. The price is cheap and portions are massive but I don't know what people are raving about. The service was very good - hence 2 stars. The roasted potatoes, although good, were drenched in oil - it made me ill. For the price - you get what you pay for...."}
{"text":"Come early if you don't want to stand in line, we waited for 50 mins as they don't have a waiting list. This was Sunday at 5 pm. BUT, it was totally worth it! The portions are huge and the food tasty. Great price too!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken soulvaki dinner and added an extra stick. Upgraded to Greek fries. Great food and great price. They expanded the restaurant so it can house more patrons. With all the new tables, the servers are having a hard time keeping up! It took forever for the manager to get my bill, even though I politely asked twice. I am knocking one star off for that. I love Messini and will be back regardless. I hope they sort out how to run this place with more customers coming."}
{"text":"Lemony. That's the dominant flavor in the pork souvlaki, the lamb chops, the potatoes, etc. The food's solid, fresh and filling. It doesn't offend and it doesn't aspire to be more than what it is. It's simply good. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"OMFZ (see what I did there?).  We ordered the gyros platters (pork and chicken), which included gigantor greek salads with delicious fresh feta, served with fresh-made greek pita and olive tapenade, a gyro stuffed with meat, tomato, RIDICULOUSLY GOOD TZATZIKI, and (oddly) french fries on top, and a starch.  x2, plus a beer and service with a smile set us back $27 total (not including tip.  I'm American.  I don't know what you people do up here, but I tip 20%, because if you don't, in NYC, you will get cut).  Like, whaaaaaaaat?  

In sum: awesome value play.  Delicious flavors.  Why are you still reading this and not on your way to Chester station RIGHT.  EFFING.  NOW?"}
{"text":"Best gyros in the city. Their chicken-pork gyros are to die for!! Order Greek fries too because they are DELICIOUS!! I am salivating just writing this review."}
{"text":"Some of the best gyros I've ever had and a really good lunch deal to boot! Feta fries (+$1), generous gyro platter/sandwich, and a pop. Not a lot of seating but easy to take out. 
I definitely miss Danforth now that I've moved to Chicago. Just can't get good Greek food here and always make a trip to Danforth every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Perfect late night snack. I usually get 2 gyros, greek fries, and greek salad. Enough food to fill you and a friend all for about $15. They put fries in the gyros and always have a good amount of feta cheese on the fries and salad. Its always busy so you know the food is fresh. Great for a quick take out meal but also a nice place to dine in. There is also a new location at Yonge and Eglinton."}
{"text":"There's always a long line up at this place at the annual Taste of the Danforth event.  I've tried it at their annual event, ordered take-out and also dined in.  
My friend and I ordered the combination meal which consist of 2 items from their list of gyros/souvlaki; choice of French fries, roasted potatoes, or rice; and salad.  
I ordered the chicken and pork gyro.  Their gyro is unique - as it comes with fries inside.  I also ordered the French fries but upgraded it to Greek fries and feta cheese.  I highly recommend upgrading this because it tastes delicious.  The Greek fries are put in the oven which makes it so crispy.  
I also love their Greek salad - comes with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and green peppers, olive oil? and lots of feta cheese.  They are definitely not cheap with feta cheese as they gave us generous amount in the fries and salad.  
Lastly, if you dine in, they give you pita bread with olive dip.  The olive dip tastes really good, and the pita bread taste average."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. Their food is decent and cheap, and it's close to my house. The problem I'm having is that their customer service has been awful every time I've been there. I've been there once for dinner, once for lunch, and once for take-out. For both of the dine-in experiences the place was pretty empty but service was very slow and unfriendly. When I went in for take-out I stood right at the register and got flat out ignored for about five minutes while several staff members did other stuff behind the counter. Yes, they were busy, but it takes two seconds to acknowledge the customer. This time I did get my food really fast, so I guess I'd recommend this place for take-out, for people who don't mind being treated like an inconvenience by the staff."}
{"text":"Messini's is great for a quick and/or cheap meal that is deliciously greasy but completely worth the calories. 
The best deal is probably the combination meals - less than $20 for 2 gyros and choice of salad, fries, etc side dishes...good to share to to save for the next day."}
{"text":"Taste of the Danforth 2014!  Here we go!!!

It's been about 4 years since I have been to Danforth so it has been a while coming.  I HAD to get the Gyro which comes with the fries inside the pita.  I couldn't wait.

Getting off the subway, we proceeded to the blocked off street.  Crazy busy.  When we got to the food tent of Messini, even BUSIER!  The line up was utter insanely long!  We were told to go to the right side to get tickets first and then fall in line.  The Pork Gyro was $5 cash.  People were passing through us in line down the street which was annoying but what can you do?  It's a Toronto festival.  Good thing for us that we were off to the left side and it was moving faster than the other lines.  Score!  I say we waited about 20 minutes.

At the front of the line, I handed our tickets to the dudes putting the Gyros together and they were hella fast.  Steamy pita, smacked a slab of tzatziki sauce, crisp onions, tomatoes, pork shavings and fries, wrapped all in one with the Messini wax paper.  Got out of line quick and to the side to eat.

The gyro looked amazing.  Check the pic.  Eating it, no doubt it was good and fresh but it just was not the best thing I have ever had.  The whole thing was enormous and had trouble finishing it.  The flavour of the pork was pretty mild and bland but had good texture.  The tzatziki was decent, but not mind blowing.  Fries were okay.

The gyro was good, would I get it again, maybe not as I would try other places on the Danforth next time.  I definitely had better as I said but I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Do you have children?
Are they hungry?
If so, then look no more, because you've found your dinner! 

Messini's is a great mix of family friendly dining and great tasting, authentic, Greek food. The service was amazing and everyone went out of their way to not only make it easier on us parents, but to flash a smile at our giggling baby. It was almost like having babysitting with the meal!

As for the food, the Meat is tender, the spices are on point, and the Greek Salad is plenty. The Meat Platter was a mountain of food and really was a great value that provided a good variety of meats. The Greek Fries were also a favorite, as were the dips and pita bread.

If you're looking for an authentic greek food, in a family friendly environment, that's easy on the wallet, this place can become your regular."}
{"text":"The place is very well established and the food is great, but it is run by assholes and you will almost guaranteed to have a bad time waiting for a table. Yeah the place gets busy and it can be stressful on the manager that works as a host, but he treats customers like dogs and don't have a system to take down or keep track of names. 

Once you get seated everything is fine because the servers are working for a tip.

Don't get take out here because they skimp on the portion in takeout boxes."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband for lunch today , it was pretty busy when we walked in . We had  to wait for 10 minutes to be seated , then we ordered Stella but the server said only one beer was left so we got a Heineken . Then I ordered the chicken gyro and my husband ordered the chicken souvlaki which took 45 minutes for us to get we probably should have ordered a sandwich and got it over with . The service was ok not memorable ."}
{"text":"Food is DELICIOUS!!! Service is decent pace but the staff (all the Greek boys ;) ) are always smiling and nice! Definitely a place I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Very wallet friendly place, good food and excellent service, our waiter was very nice! 
We went there randomly and we've been lucky! Kudos to the Greek fries with feta on it, only 5$ I recommend"}
{"text":"I've only been once, but it was enough for me to not want to go back. The service was horrible, and the food wasn't any better. I ordered the chicken souvlaki stick which appeared to be large and plump but wound up being tasteless and dry. My partner ordered a vegetarian pita. The veggies were cold and slimey, while the fries were limp - again very tasteless. Not sure of the hooplah for this place and with all the other options on the Danforth, I don't feel the need to give it another chance."}
{"text":"The value is very good. Lineups....not so much. 
I loved the pita with the fries inside. Not much else to say but come here for a cheap dinner. Service wasnt the best and I had to ask several times to get ketchup and water.  Cant blame them since theyre busy."}
{"text":"This place gets a 4 for food, but a 1.5 for service. Got here at about 9:30 with my friend and we were seated immediately. The place was still quite busy. 

It took us almost half an hour to get our order in and even 15 minutes to get water. Then after that, our food took an additional half hour as well. I also had to ask for water 5 times before I got it. 

Overall, the large meat platter is delicious, and deceptively plentiful. We ordered the beef/lamb and it was flavourful and hot. 

We also ordered the appetizer sampler for two and it was DELICIOUS AND HUGE! It came with tzaziki and these filo type spinach and cheese pastry things and a cheese spread and grape leaf rice rolls. All super fresh and delicious tasting. Would definitely recommend, as it came fresh and hot."}
{"text":"I love delicious AND cheap food and this restaurant does it for me. Notice that delicious is placed before cheap! 

Great lunch menu. Choose your dish, side, and pop, all for under $10!!! 

The pork gyro on pita was delicious. The meat was flavourful and tender. The salad was a sized portion with fresh crunchy cucumber, tomato and chunks of feta. 

The place is busy for a reason. Service is decent for such a busy place. Our party of three were in and out within 45 minutes for a weekday lunch. 

Note: they do have a patio but it's TINY. There's only 3-4 tables and they only fit 2-3 people each so if you're looking for a good patio in Greek Town, this is not it."}
{"text":"what happened to you?!!! you were so good once upon a time

FOOD
my gyros was OILY! It literally was a constant drip of oil from my gyros running down my hand. GROSS

the pork was dry too. maybe that's why they put the added oil....

Me sad."}
{"text":"Cheap food and delicious calamari. Our waiter was very attentive but everyone else there didnt acknowledge us as they stood around chatting. 

Would come here again as it was recommended to me by many and would like to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is good. Host is not. Unsure how the couple who came after us got seated before us. We thought the wait was bad... then we got seated and I think we must be second class citizens or invisible because nobody has served us and yet all the other tables seated after us have been served or at least got their waters. Very unimpressed."}
{"text":"Wish we had read the reviews first...

We ordered a chicken slouvaki wrap and a pork slouvaki wrap. When they arrived we specifically asked which was which because my wife doesn't eat pork. After a few bites, we realized they had mixed it up. My wife was obviously upset and we asked to talk to the manager, but our waitress told us that he wouldn't speak to us. 

If that wasn't bad enough, there wasn't much meat in either and the pork was extremely dry.

There are too many good Greek places on the Danny to bother with this place."}
{"text":"Messini is one of the places you have to stop by for a Gyro is you pass by Greektown. 

They have all the classical Greek dishes and they do their Gryros well. I highly suggest you try the Beef and Lamb gyro that has a great taste and should fulfill any craving. The Spanakopita and Saganaki (fried cheese) are two of my favorite sides. 

Decor is very basic, the cleanliness of the bathrooms could be better. The service is either very good or forgettable, depending on who you get to serve you and where in the restaurant your table is.

So really, for good food and decent price, you will be happy but don't expect anything more fancier."}
{"text":"I seriously think this place is overrated.  I've been here a handful of times and it's always so busy at the place where people line-up to get take-out, which is also the same spot you're supposed to wait to get a table.

To sum it up, I like the salads, they are big and they don't skimp out on tomatoes or feta cheese.  Their chicken is always dry and their potatoes are super oily.  The staff are getting their job done but they don't impress.

If you come here, get the gyro pita to-go and you will be happy."}
{"text":"Went in *yesterday at around 3p, off peak hours, restaurant way slower than normal, thought we could get a quick lunch... Damn was I ever wrong! 40 minutes today! 40 minutes to get two gyros in front of me. We're not talking some artisan chef in the back meticulously shoe stringing my french fries, tenderizing my lamb and plating my gyro. We're talking 2 pre packaged-pitas, meat off a spit, yogurt, fries and onions wrapped a la Big Mac style. Messini's isn't new to the game. Constructing that sandwich should be a science after that long. I have been a patron for over 6 years and it's sad to see service degrade to this level and no I am not writing this in spite of my most recent vist. This place has been on the decline for the past 2/3 years... And I'll take back that it's sad. It really isn't. It's a gyro, it's a pretty good one, but it's still a just a gyro. A dime a dozen, you could do a lot worse and arguably a lot better than Messini's. There are many things worth waiting for, but a gyro ain't one.

*updated today to yesterday"}
{"text":"You cannot go to Danforth and not go to Messini!

The service is here is quick. This place will satisfied all your Greek cravings without emptying your wallet!

CHICKEN GYRO PITA: This is loaded with chicken, tomatoes and with French fries topped tzaiuki sauce. The meat was not dry and this place did not skimp on the meat for all those meat lovers out there!

PORK GYRO PITA: I preferred this one more! There was generous portions of pork. The pork was so tender! 

If you want, you can get both pork and chicken in your pita! This is a great place for cheap eats. This is easily one of the best Greek lunch option in the city."}
{"text":"was here last weekend.  we were looking for some greek food so, we drove to the greek area in toronto.  one of the peeps in our group just ask some random person on the street and they recommended this place.

went in and the place looks busy, always a good sign.  there is like 5-6 racks of meat that they are slicing from for the gyros.  

i order the lamb plate.  it came with a huge salad.  that thing was a meal by itself.  the mistake was ordering the plate.  shouldve order the gyro.  i pretty much got a big plate of sliced meat.  had to order some more falafel to eat with all the meat.  each order of falafel was like 50cents..  anyways, this is by far the best gyro place ive been to ever.  our group was 7 peeps.  we also order some apps and drinks.  it came to $20 canadian per person with tips included.  my dish was $10 or $11.  the gyro was cheaper...

if i was by myself, i would go for the daily special which was like $7 i think.  they should open a chain in santa clara....  man, that was a huge bowl of salad."}
{"text":"Great authentic place. Food is good. Highlights are greek fries and the greek salad."}
{"text":"Great prices, HUGE portion sizes, grilled calamari is absolutely delicious (better than many I've had at other places). I would pass on the fried calamari if I went back (which I probably will! this place is worth a special trip!), but definitely get the feta fries with tzatziki and the grilled calamari again!

By the way, this is a big restaurant and the servers were all jumping in to help us so we didn't have one dedicated person. Good that they helped us, but a little confusing."}
{"text":"One of the best gyros and greek salad spot. It tastes so awesome that you could feel the atmosphere in Greece."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a decade and it's always been good. A real staple of Toronto. The prices are very reasonable and while service isn't the best, its got the charm of an old school greek place. They're not going to give you five star service, but it's not terrible either.

The food here is really good. The menu is big, but stick with the staples (gyros, greek fries) and you'll be good."}
{"text":"After a yelp research, me and my girlfriend got to this awesome Greek restaurant, luckily we got by lunch time so we ordered the pork gyros which was the lunch special for that day, plus 2 sides (Greek fries and roasted potatoes)

Gyros were huge, the pork was delicious and they put fries inside the gyros (add value) Both sides were even bigger! And pretty yummy! 

Also we got an excellent olive tapenade with fresh pita just after we ordered.

Overall, great food, excellent prices, huge portions, good service friendly staff... a solid 10/10!"}
{"text":"My favourite Greek spot in the GTA! If you think Mr. Greek is authentic, you clearly haven't been here.

Messini's is my favourite because it's cheap, filling, and delicious. Start your meal off with complimentary pita and order the Greek Fries if you like feta - they don't skimp on cheese here. Then, get one of their gyro pitas, or if you're really hungry, order a gyro plate. The plate is enough for two people and you can get it with roasted potatoes which are tender and slightly sour, just the way I like it.

Just beware that the service here isn't the best. You'll be greeted with a blank stare and the servers take what I call a transactional approach. They'll ask how many people are in your party and seat you, and they'll ask you what you want to order and bring it, but that's about it. The food makes up for it, though."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3, but my boyfriend said he'd give it a 4 - he loved the little pieces of potato fries they had with his meal.  

My boyfriend was super hungry after a long day of walking and wanted something simple.  So being a yelp-er, I yelped places for him.  

I ended up bringing him here and he got the Lamb Gyros lunch special.  I took a bite of it and think if they had a spicy sauce, I'd up the star level to 4.  But IMO, their gyros wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"This is worse than street meat but a few late nights it seemed necessary. Every time made me sick even when sober. If your desperate for cheap eats can I suggest square boy down the street. I Can't understand why people go here. Its really bad quality meat."}
{"text":"Went to the new location at yonge and eg. Ordered the pizza. They were out of pizza sauce so they were told by the boss to make it with ketchup. GROSS! At least there was tonnes of cheese on it"}
{"text":"No matter how many times I go to this place the gyros are always on spot. They are the same, every time, delicious and hearty for the wonderful price of $6. I don't know what they are doing, but what ever they are doing they have the formula right, Don't change that. Must have place if you are visiting the Danforth. Bonus after a couple beers."}
{"text":"FETA!  

If you like feta, then you're gonna love Messini.  In my opinion, this is one of the best restaurants if you're looking for good value.  

Naturally being located in the centre of Greektown, they have a pretty standard greek menu.  

Messini offers a dinner option that is called a combo dinner.  It includes a pita with an olive paste, a greek salad, a plate of fries and two entrees that you can choose from a list including souvlaki, gyro, and some other filler items.  If you pay an additional $2, you can upsize your fries to greek fries, and that may very well be the best $2 you ever spend in your life.  The greek fries here are to die for and the one thing that bothers me about Toronto is that this is the only place that i know that serves this simple yet stellar dish.  I know Alexandria's has greek fries but after having had them from here, mentioning any other place for greek fries almost becomes blasphemous!  

The gyros are gyros...i think the chicken and lamb are both wonderful...n yeah, they got fries in em too which most people seem to be raving about.  I personally think both the chicken and lamb gyros are good especially as part of the combo...but its still not what i go there for (im a shawarma guy...gyros are good, but not even in the same league as a good shawarma in my opinion).  

If you got two people, i think the combo is the most perfect sit-down dinner for two under $20 that you can get in downtown toronto.  Nice ambience, 4 course meal, and pretty good service as well.  

The last time i was at Messini, there were five of us meaning we could only get two combos and the fifth person was to be the odd one out ordering straight off the menu.  So i experimented by getting a plate of greek fries to myself as well as a plate of gyro meat...PHENOMENAL!  I personally enjoyed that meal more then the standard combo, but for first timers wanting the full experience, i recommend starting with the combo, and then graduating onto the greek fry fanatic with greek fries and a side of your favorate gyro meat on the side (about $10 for both items).  

Enjoy your experience and watch out for rush hour because exceptional food at cheap prices will often result in LONG line-ups during the peak timings."}
{"text":"If I am in Greek town I always go here. It is always packed but the wait is quick, food is always good and very reasonable!  Service is nothing special. Try the feta fries!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to sit down for a cheap and above average pita gyro, this may be your place.

If you are looking to take out, beware! I've enjoyed my orders at the restaurant but I have had 6 take out orders totally botched. Some pita gyros don't come with any pita! I have had those taking the order to repeat the order, and they are still wrong. It's pretty disappointing!"}
{"text":"Messini is the closest experience I've had to a authentic Greek gyro since I've been to Greece. The meat is tasty and tender, the pita is fluffy, the veggies are crisp, and the tzaziki is balanced. The Greek fries are phenomenal, and the calamari is worth noting as well! Definitely worth popping into for some quick, casual Greek fare."}
{"text":"I reviewed them on their Facebook page originally and they deleted my review. If I could rate them in the minuses, I would. 

When I came here, it was with another person and the service we received was horrendous. A total lack of respect and decency from the people running the joint. While living in the area, I would come by and dine in every now and again prior to this very last time.

It was a Friday evening, nearing the dinner rush. There was a family waiting to be seated, sitting on the bench with their kids. My companion and I were next in line, waiting to be seated. Then the lineup for the dinner rush began. Hoards of people walked in looking for tables. That's when sh*t hit the fan. The family before us gets seated and a couple that had just finished eating were on their way out. We visibly see their table getting wiped down, expecting that we'll be next. But here's the kicker, ladies and gentleman, a couple at the very back end of the line who had momentarily walked in get told to come to the front of the line to be seated! Without a care in the world, neither the guy who I imagine to be the manager nor these patrons who bypassed the line cared for who was first in line. My companion and I who had been waiting for nothing were perplexed and trying to get clarification as to what happened. The 'manager' says if you're not happy, leave. And that we did, due to poor management and piss poor service. It's a shame that you would treat your customers in this manner as reputation is what brings in diners.

BUT.. Thank you for showing us out the door, cause we went to a 1000x better restaurant called \"Palace\" near Pape & Danforth & received phenomenal service & food. It has become our go-to spot for Greek food.

Anyone considering coming to this joint ought to go to Palace instead cause you'll be treated with courtesy and respect and the food is actually fresh & delicious."}
{"text":"VIBE 
Right in the heart of Greektown, this place is always bustling and on weekends is open until the wee hours of the night. Perfect if you're in the east end and don't want to wait in line for poutine or burritos elsewhere. Or well, if you're craving Greek. 

I EAT 
Chicken or pork gyros. Hefty portions and just like they do it in the motherland: with the french fries wedged in.  You can eat half and save the other half for later. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Don't mess-ini with your gyros. I know there's stiff competition with Alexandros but I think Messini will win the popularity contest in this round."}
{"text":"Came here because it was the only place open at 11pm on a Wednesday.
Beers took forever to arrive, after delaying to tell us they were out of Stella.
Each ordered beef/lamb gyros meals, and the salad was good to start.
Then they brought my rice, then afterwards my friend's fries.
FINALLY brought us the gyros, which were not the premium priced beef/lamb but pork, we decided not to fuss and just eat and get out.

HERE\"S THE KICKER:
I wanted to write off my meal as I was travelling. Asked for a split bill, waiter said the system was archaic and couldn't split the bill. But when he noticed he under charged us for beers he certainly had no problem doing up a new bill.

Fool me once, shame on you. I can assure you it'll only be once!"}
{"text":"Been here on a number of occasions over the years but it's never lived up to the hype I hear from others. It seems they recently purchased the unit next door and renovated which I think adds to the ambiance and space which was previously lacking. 

Food is just Sub-par I find the chicken gyro especially to be super fatty and lots of random skin and other undesirable bits. Tzatziki sauce is supppppeeeerr spicy and the garlicky after taste will stay with you for about 24 hrs so not a great date spot if you're looking forward to a kiss haha. 

Not the worst Greek I've had but probably not worth anymore chances in my book."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've stopped going to Astoria because I found this gem last year. I've been a few times and it's amazing! I'm glad they have the calamari back on menu but was sad the last time I went they didn't have the cheese balls. Everything is amazing though!"}
{"text":"Amazing value for lunch, had the pork gyros plate for $9.00 and it had a very generous amount of delicious pork, roast potatoes, a drink, and a really nice bread with tapenade for the table.  Service was good as well, decoration was nice."}
{"text":"I am not sure how to review this place... Sometimes good sometimes bad overall: inconsistent. Sure, the deals are great but I have dined here and ordered take-out and here are my experiences.

Dine-in: waitresses are young ladies who hardly speak and carry a face with them like they hate their job (came here at least 3 times and all different waitresses but same story) Not sure what's up with that, either crappy place to work or perhaps I just don't fit into the Greek culture? :S Good quantity food. I've only ever ordered gyro combos. Beware they won't pay enough attention to ever refill your water leaving you very thirsty with all the salty food unless you can get them to refill the small glass.

Take-out: For some reason when I order the gyro combo for take-out it's mandatory to have greek salad. I had a minor dispute with the person taking my order and he agreed to remove the mandatory salad in place for a side of fries instead. 15 mins. later I get my order and there is the dreaded greek salad in my take-out bag. I always end up throwing the salad in the trash as it consists of giant chunks of cucumber... just not very appetizing at all. Props to their pork gyros though, delicious. Oh yea, if you plan on ordering take-out be prepared to wait 20-30 minutes or more if they're busy!"}
{"text":"imho, it's hard to get a good gyros in toronto. i haven't been there for a while though, but messini comes closest. service and décor are unexceptional. grab and go."}
{"text":"I had a delicious Chicken Gyro and greek fries! This food travels very well (I travelled 40 mins) it was not soggy when I got it home! Service was good and fast!"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food for the buck on the Danforth. The tzaziki sauce is what dreams are made of. Get the greek fries with feta."}
{"text":"Iv eaten here a couple of times n always get a gyros sandwich with feta fries n drink. Most of the time its awesome but this time the sandwich was cold n although tasty, it was still disappointing. They have daily specials, todays was chicken sandwich with a side and a drink."}
{"text":"Great Food but consistently terrible service.  Always takes ages to get served and 80% of the servers get something wrong, though they do take care of it.  No consistency or timing in serving the meals.  They just bring out what's ready when it is even if my entry shows up 15 minutes before everyone else's or your appetizer shows up after your entrée  If they could get their service improved this place would be dynamite."}
{"text":"Messini's is a solid spot for gyros done right. It is always busy and rightfully so. It is great value for the money and the quality is right where it should be. For good quality dine-in or take-out, this is a great spot on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I got the lamb gyro.  It was under ten bucks, and it was so flavorful and juicy without being fatty.  The tzatziki sauce was amazing.  The only problem I have with this place is that the waiters can be kind of rude.  I ordered carryout."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap Greek food that's open late. Great for a quick bite. ~$15 before tax for a delicious chicken souvlaki dinner on a pita with Greek salad and roasted potatoes. It was delicious. 

If you're hungry and want good food without a fancy atmosphere, I'd recommend this."}
{"text":"Rated the best Gyros in Toronto! Tried this place out couple of years ago and it's my go to place for Greek food! Prices are very reasonable! You can get 2 sandwiches, fries and salad for $15. Seating was an issue before but they just took over the unit beside them and broke down the wall in between. Great Greek Food!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Great food, large portions at a low price. Even the staff was very helpful. We were ordering dinners and he suggested we pair them up and have the special two plate which would save us money, and it did!

Love the staff, love the food, love the portions."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend of mine who brought me here saying that this was the best restaurant to eat at in the entire area. Boy, was this place a treat. This definitely did not disappoint.

This place is known for their gyros and rightfully so. I ordered the chicken gyro and my friend ordered the pork gyro. We came during lunch so each came with a drink and a salad,potatoes, fries or rice - All for only 8 bucks each! Anyways, the service was very friendly and I had no issues with food taking a while. This place was FULL when we arrived so you knew it had to be good.

We got pita first with a very interesting looking sauce, it's kind of purplish and there's definitely olive oil in it but I cannot lay my finger on what that sauce. Anyways, the sauce was kind of bitter yet very savory and it was really good. When the food arrived, it came in huge portions. The gyro was gigantic and they literally gave me a full big potato roasted in this yellow greek sauce. The pita was packed with fries, TONS of chicken and some onions and tzatziki sauce. It looked normal until I took a bite out of it and WOW it really was the best gyro I've ever had. The chicken had this flavor to it that was absolutely phenomenal and the fries were not dry but very soft like those mcdonalds fries that were slightly undercooked yet so good.

The meal was absolutely stuffing and by far worth every penny. There was a reason why this place was packed and why my friend brought me here and I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed by the food if you came here - I'm not sure about the service as some people have complained about it but I had no problems so be sure to check this gem out!"}
{"text":"I went to Messini's for the third time today.  Each time I've tried something different.  The first time I had the chicken gyros which I wasn't too happy with.  I thought the meat was a little sketchy.  The second time I had the grilled calamari which was very good.  Today, I tried the chicken souvlaki and I wished I had ordered the calamari instead.  It was okay, but the pita was a little dry.

So why a four?  I like the salad and the tapenade, and I really like the greek fries.  They are especially good if you are a hungover... like a greasy magical cure.  Each time I've gone, I've had good service - friendly and efficient.  I've never encountered any of these epic waits people mention; in fact, I've never even had to wait to get a table.  And for the money, the amount of food you get is insane.  I always have leftovers.  

No, it is definitely nothing fancy, but for quick eats, it's just fine."}
{"text":"Walked in yesterday for a couple of pitas, one pork and one chicken ($14). It looks like a nice place with lots of seating. The gentleman at the cash rung me up, not the most friendliest fellow. He told me 5 minutes. While waiting inside one of the cooks gets my attention and says 15 minutes.  I was in a hurry to attend a concert so there was very little time. The cash guy told me they didn't have any pork ready so I told him to make them both chicken and they made them right away. 

The pitas were a good size but they put French fries in them. I didn't care for that as it makes for a mushy mouthful. However, the seasoned chicken and tzatziki sauce was tasty."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Very delicious.

Portions are generous and the prices are fair. You definitely get what you pay for.

I've only been here at night and there was no waiter service. I believe that's only during the day.

Will be returning."}
{"text":"Tremendously massive gyros, with just the right amount of onion for most people (I love onions, so maybe not enough for me), sauce, fries, hot pita...for $5, and that includes tax. I felt full even after my 6 mile walk there (and to be honest, I bet that didn't offset the calories); I'd do it again."}
{"text":"The food is cheap in price, and it is extremely filling, but the quality of food is poor. Extremely bland food, no flavour at all. Better going elsewhere then here."}
{"text":"Best gyros that I've found in the city.  Lamb is my fave!"}
{"text":"5 stars for takeout, 3 stars for dine-in.

Messini definitely has the best gyros and souvlaki pitas on the Danforth. Large portion, well priced and delicious meat cooked to perfection. Reminds me very much of a place called Luckys Souvlaki on the island of Santorini in Greece. Fries in my pita? Yes please.

The dine-in situation is somewhat different. Messinis has a large menu with many typical Greek dishes, but the prices here are too spendy for just adequate food quality. The seating inside is dark and dismal looking too. Clean and spacious but looking for like a newly renovated McDonalds rather than a restaurant with  real ambiance.

Small patio at the front with a few small tables is a good option. 

Wine served by the kilo or half kilo, just like in Ellada!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Always get the greek fries! The salad is pretty refreshing too.. with lots of feta sprinkled on top. They have daily specials, and recently my friends and I all ordered their chicken wrap special (Thursday) with the fries upgraded to Greek. This also came with a drink. The total, including tip was around $11! Amazing. The service was a bit slow, especially when it came to paying, but it was really busy and I think they only had two waitresses."}
{"text":"Not the best Greek food I've had. We ordered pork gyros and Greek fries. The Greek fries were pretty good. The pork gyros was dry and needed more seasoning. I was definitely expecting better! I would say that I prefer the pork gyros at The Original Gyros Grill! I'm not sure if I just came on A bad day but was somewhat disappointed!"}
{"text":"4.5*

You can't really go wrong with Messini takeout;
The efficiency and efficacy of the staff in providing you with a fresh, packed sandwich can only be matched by Webber's. The toppings are fresh, the finely seasoned meat is piled high, and they get the tzatziki right! What's also key is that the taste and service have been perfectly consistent ever since I followed fellow Yelpers to this gyros Mecca following an elite event in 2010. There really isn't much more you can ask for when you're paying somewhere in the region of $5!

The lines could be annoying on the weekend, and they charge extra for small amounts of tzatziki, but this shouldn't take away from what is a true standard for gyros + souvlaki in Toronto. 

Overall a fantastic choice for a quick meal, at least in terms of taste if not health. Be weary that this original location serves up much better grub than others."}
{"text":"You've seen it everywhere - a big hunk of meat on a skewer revolving under a searing heat.  It's a feast of street meat.  There's always a good deal of fat on the meat to prevent it from drying.  As you look at the sweaty meat you get hungry, and you also get somewhat ashamed that you are about to eat this artery-clogging street meat that's been revolving on a skewer for who knows how long.  The meat is shaved and then scooped into pita bread, with some veggies and toppings.  

There are different variations on the theme, using different meats and spices.  There are also different names depending on the origin, from shawarma to donair, to gyro.

In my opinion this place can hold its own against any meat-on-a-stick in the city.  There are several skewers for different types of meat all are delicious and nicely spiced.  The meat is always seared nice and crisp on the outer layer."}
{"text":"I don't have gyros unless I'm on the Danforth, and if I'm on the Danforth, I don't have gyros that aren't from Messini. I always get the chicken gyro, which is never more than $5. If I'm extra hungry, I get an order of feta fries, too. I've also had the gyros pizza from time to time. Always super good, reasonably priced, and satisfying. I've never had bad food here.

Decor isn't super fancy, but they have a few tables set up outside like a mini patio, and the lighting is pretty on the inside. Messini has a loyal customer base, and is almost always packed. You're fine if you're going for lunch; if you have to wait, it won't be for very long. If you're coming here for dinner, be prepared to wait at least 10-20 minutes, standing crowded with everyone else wanting a table. Dinner hours are super loud too, given the turnout, so maybe not the best place for romantic date conversation. 

They don't split the bill for you here. If you want it split, you need to calculate it yourself, then they'll punch it into the machine or you pay with cash. Don't expect great service either, because you won't get it. Waiting staff is limited, and more often than not, I end up having to ask for something twice. 

But the food is so good, I'll never escape this place--they'll just keep pulling me back."}
{"text":"First time dining in here; usually we get take out. Service was atrocious. We were seated promptly, given our waters and made our orders. Only half of our appetizers came. Our server never checked up on us. We could see other tables who came after us getting their meals. Eventually someone else came and asked us what else we were waiting on. This was 40 minutes later, with still no sign from our original server. We did eventually get the rest of our food which honestly wasn't very good. I know Messinis has a reputation of being one of the top Greek restaurants on the block but it seems to be losing it as of late. The gyros were on the bland and dry side. Could just be an off day, usually it's pretty good. Wouldn't dine in here again, despite the expansion."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of having fries in my gyro but the chicken  in it was delicious and I really wanted to fall asleep after having it during the taste of Danforth."}
{"text":"It's not a super good restaurant but it's budget friendly and u get the quality u pay for. I used to visit frequently and eat there and the service depends on how busy the restaurant is, means that if the restaurant is busy then service becomes slow and waiters becomes less friendly.
It was a very small restaurant and in weekends I had to wait for about 20 mins or less to be seated. But after the expansion there is almost no wait time. The menu is not different to most of the restaurants in the area that serve geek food, I would still go there but not as frequent as I used to.
My favorite thing on the menu there is the Chicken gyros and Greek fries. They taste good especially the Greek fries. This place is not ideal for a date, it's good for friends hangout though."}
{"text":"Wow, Messini has simply the best gyros ever. We were here for Taste of the Danforth and knew we were in for a treat when there was a huge line up! We waited for about 20 minute and it was well worth it. I had the pork gyros (pork, fries, tomatoes, lettuce, souvlaki sauce, all on a grilled pita). Omg, it was to die for. We quickly gobbled down this delight and it was all for $5. Plus, it filled us up so much that w didn't have to eat for another 7 hours because it was that good. It was heavenly and simply the best gyros I've ever had. A must try for Greek food lovers."}
{"text":"Does \"G\" stand for Greek food? Or gluttony? The portions here are seriously  GENEROUS. 

Two of us split a combination meal consisting of a vegetarian pita, pork gyrosmeat, a Greek salad, pita + olive tapenade, and feta fries. All this for $13.95 (+ $1.00 for upgrading to feta fries). Consumed with \"eyes bigger than stomach\" syndrome, we chose to add on an order of spanakopita ($3.95) as well. Total damage came to less than $25 with tax and tip for a meal that could have easily fed 3 people. 

The vegetarian pita comes bursting with loads of grilled green peppers & onions, tomato, cucumber, lettuce, french fries (!), tzatziki sauce and olive tapenade. This hard-to-eat number was tasty, but not that memorable. My favourite part of the meal was probably the feta fries, which for a nominal additional cost of $1.00, are a must. Unfortunately I didn't particularly enjoy the spanakopita here, as it was more \"greasy\" than \"flaky\" and the seasoning of the filling didn't seem quite right. 

For good Greek food on the Danforth at a more than reasonable price, come to Messini! I've paid much more at other restaurants where the food wasn't half as good."}
{"text":"Greek salad had lots of cucumber and a good amount of feta. Ordered the mixed platter that included pork, lamb and sausage which came as a pile of greek love, plus an extra side of potatoes. The sovalki chicken was on the dry side but the gyros pork was excellent as well as the lamb. $16

My friend enjoyed a lamb gyro with fries inside it which was a hit. $5 bucks flat.
The third member in the party ate a chicken gyro dinner plate with greek salad, and potatoes. 

Tasty, inexpensive and overall good food. Review is based on price, as there is potentially better Greek in the Danforth."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant experience in my life. Food was overcooked. Meals took ages and did not arrive together. My son received something different from what he ordered. The waiter hid while all the tables around us were experiencing similar problems. We could not eat the food because it was so awful/overcooked/tasteless and sent it all back. We asked to speak to the manager who took a full 30 minutes to come to the table. 

When he did arrive he was rude arrogant and blamed the waiter for everything.  He refused to take anything off the bill and actually started arguing with me because I would not pay for food we could not eat. 

He told us defiantly that if we didn't want to pay, to leave and then followed us out to the street yelling at us!!!!!

Avoid this restaurant unless you like abuse, horrible service and salmonella."}
{"text":"I don't eat Greek food that often... as not often as this is the 2nd time in my lifetime. The first time I have Greek food, I never enjoyed it.. I think it is at one of those Mr. Greek place. But thanks for fellow yelpers highly recommended Messini Authentic Gyros.. I now starting to have cravings for  tzatziki!!! 

We arrived at around 4 pm on a weekday afternoon! Gee this place is packed!! Almost all the tables were occupied. I enjoy busy restaurants since it is a sign of good food and the atmosphere.

My friend ordered the grilled pork dinner  and I ordered the chicken Souvlaki pita. 

The dinner came with a generous serving of Greek salad and bread with olive paste. I am not a cheese person but I love the feta cheese that was inside the salad. The bread is nice and warm and have good texture.. (my carb craving was satisfied!!) The pork though, we found that a little dried... but still tasty!

When I ordered my gyros, I was informed the wait wil be 20 min! And I have to tell you that my gyros really worth my wait. The pita bread ah ah ah...carbs! It was stuffed with tzatziki ozzing out with every bite! This is such a good take out items to enjoy in the park on a nice summer day! And you can always feed the birds with your french fries!

The domestic beer are selling for $3.95 that is quite reasonable and will be great to wash down with the gyros!!

The services was quick and efficent. as Jenny T mentioned, they got their job done;

The food is great and the price is reasonable, this is always a winning combination!

They accepts all credit cards."}
{"text":"Not sure why Messini has 3.5 stars.
The food is amazing. The value is great!
Their greek fries is a must!

Service is quick and straight forward!
I keep going back to Messini as they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Good value for your money. The portions are huge. The restaurant looks a lot larger from the outside but it seems quite family friendly."}
{"text":"Love/Hate relationship with this place. 

The staff are extremely rude, even for Greektown. The gyro is usually dry, bland and mediocre. However they are open late on weekends making them the staple Danforth really-late night option. However I would never, ever recommend them before 1am or a few drinks."}
{"text":"Awful service. Tasty, tasty lamb gyros. Can't vouch for anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Why would you ever go to McDonald's when stores like this exist?

A gyro will put you back about as much as any McDonald's burger, and there is no way the burger is nearly as delicious.

Seriously, after eating college cafeteria-made gyros for so long, I didn't realize they could be this good.

The pita bread was a bit stiff and I really should've ordered the lamb instead of the beef (it was tough and a bit unwieldy), but the extra tzatziki sauce was absolutely worth it. The spanakopita we ordered was also not as flaky and tasty as it can be, but again, these prices cannot be beat.

The food isn't mind-blowingly good, but it's a steal for the price. I'll definitely try to return to here."}
{"text":"Great food for its price. Excellent customer service. I would definitely come back and try the rest of the menu. The lamb for my gyros was superb."}
{"text":"Great takeout spot! I had the chicken gyros wrap and it was everything I could have imagined for - the perfect balance of savoury chicken and creamy tzatziki sauce with veggies and fries. Delicious and cured my hangover from the previous night just fine. Really well priced too, the cherry on top!"}
{"text":"I'm a lover of Shawarma with fries so when this was recommended to me I had to try it. 
I love the chicken gyros pita :O !! For $5 you can't go wrong. It's packed with warm meat, stuffed with fries and has a load of garlic sauce. Definitely well worth the price. I prefer getting it to-go, because I think the combination of the steam from the warm meat softens the bread which can get quite hard.
Their dine-in service is great, although they can be super busy. I had trouble with my pita being too hard, and he replaced it immediately without fuss. I got the combo with 2 items and 2 sides. I ordered a chicken gyros pita, souvlaki stick (came with pita and plenty of tzatiki sauce on the side), greek salad, and greek fries. The greek fries were these amazing round fries with feta. The feta was overpowering, so I wasn't a fan. But we were both stuffed and it cost $20 including tip. I even had half of my gyro packed up."}
{"text":"Totally good value for your money, you get a lot of food for what you pay, which is my case as a poor ass student, is pretty awesome. Go when you're super hungry, cause otherwise it's hard to finish. 

No complaints about flavour, Greek isn't my first pick, but I still enjoyed it a lot. The meat is super soft and skillful done. The only thing to say is that when I tried both of my friends dishes, the taste didn't differentiate from mine much. There's not much flavour variation between things. 

This place is super casual so it's mostly groups here, I went with a group of friends. 

The thing that ruined my experience a bit was our server. This guy said rude things to us, ignored us, forgot drinks and took his sweet time getting the bill (half an hour). He also continually clicked his tongue at us and kept doing these super dramatic sighs whenever we ordered. 

It's unlikely that every server is like this, but he was unpleasant enough to make me not want to return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love gyros but they are rather expensive in the US so we decided to go try messinis for our second night in Toronto. We took a cab (uber) so I am not sure about parking. We arrived around 7 pm and there was an expected wait. We waited for about 25 minutes but it was worth it! When we sat we ordered the Greek fries, lamb, chicken and mixed gyro with pork. The server was very polite and our food came out in minutes! These gyros were so big and I loved that they put French fries in them! The pita bread is packed and it holds everything so nice together to avoid being messy! The Greek fries were good! So many orders came out so I highly recommend trying! My favorite was the  mixed gyro. Normally I love lamb but the lamb was a bit chewy at times! The food here is delicious and cheap!! I would go back!"}
{"text":"The good:
The hype. You want to think it'll be the best ever.

The bad:
The hype makes it pretty pedestrian and average.

The ugly:
When you realize it wasn't really that good."}
{"text":"Good. Cheap. Fast. Yes, it's greasy. What do you expect from this sort of place? Especially the sort of place that makes it a a habit to put fries in your gyro. C'mon, folks. It is what it is.

Have the lamb gyro. On the side, have the Greek fries to consummate your devotion to starch and meat. To be honest, ti'd be 10 times better if you were totally plastered before coming here. But it's good sober ,too."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could ever give this place less than 5 stars. 

The food is delicious, cheap and the service - although cranky - is fast. Every time I go, I order my favourite mixed meat Shawarma (with pork and chicken) and I am never disappointed. It is so great seeing them cut meat off the spit freshly and then pull out freshly fried fries out of the fryer (try saying that three times fast) and throwing all these fresh foods into my gyros.

I have never been disappointed by their cheap and easy food. Will always come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! My fav is the pork gyro but the chicken is also great and greek fries are perfectly crispy and salty from the melted feta on top, they arent a typical long fri, they are more like wavy, chips but just as awesome! Only $7 and you get a gyro that is LOADED with meat and fries (I get no fries as I prefer more meat) and I can't finish it in one sitting so I always have half for later. They serve you fast so just go directly to cashier if you are in a rush and taking it to go. You can also call in an order for pickup just be sure that you have the right location. All gyros come with fries, onion and tomato and you can add feta or no fries if you prefer."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Decent cheap eat but don't go there if you want to be serviced.  Waited 30 minutes for a table of 2 but people who just got there were seated first.  Insulting.  Won't be eating from here again."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times. Don't plan to return. 

On the down side: neglectful service once order is placed, no water refills, rarely any attentiveness or care from the servers, and I've been denied menu items a few times due to lack of preparedness (i.e. mozzarella was \"too frozen\" to order the Gyros pizza, and the grill is turned off at 12 AM). 

2/5 stars because portions are large and well priced. Found myself returning for the Greek fries, salad, and kebab plates. 

Side note - their ketchup bottles could use replacing. See photo."}
{"text":"This place is always so stinkin busy!!! But the food is great and the price is right. It's high on my recommendation list"}
{"text":"The dine in experience is controlled chaos...very busy but a short wait to get a table. The meal portions are large enough for two and reasonably priced. Certainly not the best Greek cuisine I have experienced but a good choice. Saganaki was different than anywhere else I have had it...probably skip it."}
{"text":"Messini located on the Danforth is probably know to serve one of the best Gyros in Toronto and I haven't been until a few weeks ago, mainly because of how pack it is no matter what time and day. 

It's not only a cheap eat here but also a late eat spot, open till midnight from Sun-Thurs and until 4am on Fri-Saturdays.

We arrive at around 2pm on a Saturday and the place was packed both with people ordering take out and people waiting for a table. Although it was packed, we had to wait for only 10-15mins

Greek Fries $4.20
~ It's basically Fries w/ oregano and feta then put under the broiler for a bit so the cheese just begins to melt. 
~ It's just as simple and good as it gets ;)

Rickard's Red $3.85
~ At that price, Ben just couldn't resist ordering a beer to go with the Fries

The best Gyros in town, so we have to order it and there's basically 4 choice : 
~Chicken, Pork, Lamb & Mixed (Chicken + Pork) 
~ which is shaved from the spit and served in a pita topped with onions, tomatoes, tzatziki & French Fries

Chicken Gyros Pita $4.87 & Lamb Gyros Pita $5.31
~ Although the lamb is very flavorful, we both liked the chicken better since there was crispy chicken skin in it which add flavor and texture. 
~ Yes there's French fries in their pita here which apparently is the custom in many Greek cities especially Messini.....
~  the French fries make the already large pita extra filling. With high expectation, I was expecting more, although good it was definitely not mind blowing.
~ We also asked for hot sauce and we expected a house-made / Greek version but we were only given a bottle of Tabasco. 

Pork Souvlaki Stick $3.50
~ Pork grilled on a skewer and served with tzatziki
We were told that there's a 20 minutes wait for the souvlaki and that's why it only arrives toward the end of the meal. Although it was very well seasoned, it wasn't as tender and yummy as the ones at Loui`s Kouzina uptown.

Verdict :
~ Cheap Eats & Good Food
~ Perfect if I ever had a late night Gyros crave ;)
~ I will definitely come back, maybe in the summer and get take out so there's no wait"}
{"text":"Fantastic, inexpensive greek style food.  Great for take out or eat in.

The round 'fries' are delicious.  Portions are a decent size and good for sharing.

Highly recommended quick and delicious greek 'fast' food, packed with flavor and value."}
{"text":"Good food but THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE RECEIVED from the waiters. Waitresses had attitude and waiter gave my order to another table."}
{"text":"A truly great dining experience! A few friends and I decided to venture out and try a few new and well liked restaurants in the GTA. Messini did not disappoint! 

The food is fresh, succulent and absolutely delicious. We ordered Spanakopita, Deep Fried Calamari and Saganaki. The appetizers alone filled us up but we were eager to try their main dishes. We ordered the combination dinner with pork and chicken souvlaki as well as the feta fries. Paired with that was the chicken gyros dinner with roasted potatoes. Each dinner came with a side salad- we opted for Greek. The ingredients in the salad were crisp and fresh- none of the mushy or bitter tastes I've had with other Greek salads. The feta fries were covered in feta (they truly do not skimp on the ingredients) and we could not eat them fast enough. Both the souvlaki and gyros were juicy and cooked to perfection- no issues with overcooking or dry meat here. For 3 appetizers and 2 dinners, our bill came to roughly $50 for 3 people. Great price, even better food!

Side note: Our server seemed a bit confused and was eager to serve us before having a chance to look at the menu. Everyone seemed to be doing their job effectively, however, would have liked to see a little bit more interest in connecting with customers as opposed to 'just taking an order'. 

Will most definitely be returning here and recommending it to friends!"}
{"text":"Cheap. Large Portions. A large variety of greek cuisine choices on the menu. Most meals come with whichever entree you select (i.e. souvlaki, gyro, etc) plus a hearty greek salad, and choice of fries, rice or potatoes.

Service is pretty quick, they want to get people in and out to keep the place flowing. Be prepared to wait a couple extra minutes for souvlaki's as they cook them as ordered - well worth the wait.

Another bonus - open late on weekends for those wanting an after bar/club snack. Can't verify the quality of grub at this hour."}
{"text":"Finally i made it to a mediterranean restaurant in Greektown!  My friend recommended Messini because the dishes come in generous portions.  I was not disappointed.  I ordered a grilled octopus appertizer dish and it was pretty good.  Definitely not chewy.  My friend ordered a gyro and boy!  It was huge!!!!  We also ordered pizza as well and the 3 items altogether set us back $25.  Pretty good price for all that food!!  We left the restaurant at around 9pm and there was a line up waiting to be seated.   I will go back for sure to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Our server could care less about us & did not exchange any pleasantries. Didn't come by to check on us so we had to chase her down. She also forgot to put in something we ordered. 

Restroom was clean but restaurant wasn't. My cup had food on it! 

I ordered the lamb/beef gyro which really was out of this world. Some of the best tzatziki I've ever had. I def recommend grabbing a gyro here, but to go only..."}
{"text":"First off, been coming to the Danforth for Greek food for years!!!food has always been great but tonight we decided to come here with a party of 8. 

The whole night was Meh.. These guys were bringing the wrong orders over and over all night. Then got mad at us? Ummm ok. Sorry your incompetent and can't bring out what we ordered off YOUR menu. Beef kabab was over done and super salty. The A/C wasn't on, it was 32 degrees outside, thus, half the table didn't even finish their meal. 

1 star, only because 0 is not an option. 

Tip: Keep walking. Much much much better Greek food elsewhere! And they'll probably have their air on when there's a heat warning in the city."}
{"text":"Was there Friday December 9, 2016

- there was a very cold draft at the table we were that came whenever someone opened the front door.

- we didn't know who was serving us. The place was half-full. At least 3 servers kept walking by, and all of them ignored us. 

- they asked if we wanted a split bill after giving us our bill, then tried to do the math at the table. 

- the gyros was not great at all. They try to stuff you with fries.

I get the impression that this place is better tailored for take out after a night on the town."}
{"text":"Good juicy gyros at reasonable prices... I'm a fan.

The meat platters served with rice or salad are quite good too... 

Big portions, full tummy!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fries inside gyros?! Greatest food invention ever. If your ever in the downtown area and craving good food, this place is open late! Be warned though, you'll get a food coma if you order their dinner lol."}
{"text":"was very happy to come and visit this location as I frequent the area for concerts quite often, a very quick 5 minute walk from Broadview station and I arrived at this place, upon arrival I understood why people rave about this place, the smells absolutely infect your nose right away, the wonderful smells and noise come the kitchen instantly left me salivating from the get go. also on arrival I couldn't help but notice the huge line up, suffice to say I had some time to wait but I also had a concert on the evening I came here. this had to have been one of the faster line up I've been through as well. I got one chicken and one lamb gyro to go. all of the flavors that I was smelling and left me foaming at the mouth for it, reflected well in the taste as well, but I have to say that I was more impressed with the chicken then I was with the lamb. (finding out later that the lamb was mixed with beef was a poor choice for me) the lamb was cooked very well but I wasn't a fan of the consistency of the lamb, the onions I should have did without for future reference. 
a very good greektown experience I would definitely go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"So when I first got there it looked like it was just a long narrow room but once you get past the take out / cash area you see it opens up into the building next door, so lots of seating.

I know people in their reviews were talking about how bad service was, but I had no problem. Everyone was nice, they were prompt, asked if we needed things, even when it was busy.

So we ordered a plate of Greek fries to share and we each got a chicken gyros.

The fries. Delicious. They are actually deep fried potatoes disks covered with feta cheese and a sprinkle or oregano served in a large plate, perfect for sharing! Simple but delicious.

The gyros were also really good. Thick chunks of dark meat chicken tazihki sauce, on a pillowy soft pita. With fries stuffed in. Yup fries.

Weirdly worked?!

The food came crazy fast, and was very in expensive"}
{"text":"A huge establishment that offers authentic and affordable staples in Greektown. They are perhaps the most well known for their gyros and meat platters. 

We got the Greek fries to start, a huge appetizer dish topped with a generous amount of feta cheese. This dish was heavenly! As my main, I decided to go for the octopus which came with a side salad. The meat was very tender but could have used a bit more seasoning. We also tried the gyro pizza which is exactly what it sounds like! All in all, a delicious option if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing tasty food. I'm a chef de cuisine and i know my food, this place does great gyros for great prices, the flavor and freshness of these gorgeous big gyros are outstanding blasting with flavors, highly recommend the lamb gyro with tzatziki and feta. enjoy everyone, bon appetite"}
{"text":"If you are a vegan, this is NOT for you

For the rest of humans, you'll enjoy it apparently. Good food, cheap.

I don't give more stars because being a vegan/flexible vegan didn't give me the chance to enjoy it as much :/ 

Sorry"}
