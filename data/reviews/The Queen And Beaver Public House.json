{"text":"I came in for brunch, really looking forward to the full English breakfast, especially blood pudding! But when I arrived they informed me they've been out of blood pudding for almost two months (something about suppliers). I was definitely disappointed but I still opted to try the full English breakfast set. The set came with a regular sausage, bacon, your choice of eggs, beans, mushrooms, and your choice of bread. The fried toast really stood out to me, great flavour. Unfortunately everything else was all quite bland."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Hostess had major attitude and after moving us all around the place, the equally-as-rude server informed us they were no longer serving food. This was after we were told repeatedly they were closing at 1am, yet it was 11:30pm. Closing up shop early and terrible customer service."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and unfortunately it's a little too pricey for the amount of food you get. I ordered the eggs benny and a side of toast. The eggs benny was decent enough but I have had a lot better. A little light on the hollandaise sauce and the eggs weren't prepared as ordered. Included with the eggs benny was a small salad. The order of toast was one piece so I had to order an additional piece so I could enjoy two. Two pieces of toast was 5.00, a little cheeky in my books. 

All in all, the atmosphere is great, the table service not so much. The staff are pleasant but not the most attentive. I am sure it's a great place to hang out and enjoy a few pints while watching some PML but at $60 for brunch for two I will take a pass next time I am in the hood. 

I did walk in with preconceived notions based on the recent Toronto Life review and to be fair the review was based on the lunch/dinner menu."}
{"text":"Beer selection week af. Refused to put the Raptors playoff game on the TV!?! Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide to do 3 or 4 stars only because of the wait for the entrees.  I would have overlooked it but many of the reviews also say they waited (and waited and waited) for service, apps or entrees.  No one likes to wait more than 20 mins btwn courses.
But the food IS really good.  And  I love the atmosphere.  I will definitely go back.

UPDATE:  I went back with a group of 20 people for a birthday and it was during the hockey playoffs.  There was a TV in the dining room but THEY WOULD NOT TURN IT ON.  Even with the sound OFF!!!!  There were 20 of us!  I saw they are advertising themselves as a place to watch World Cup but I would NEVER go to this place during a sporting event.  Also, it irks me when places don't try and please a customer and help facilitate their pleasurable experience.  It doesn't make sense from a customer service perspective.  Also, the service was STILL very slow.  And the food was not as good as the first time.  A little bland.  So I am dropping my stars from 4 to 2."}
{"text":"great atmosphere upstairs. perfect for watching football matches, if you are into that. very well designed establishment."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Toronto for a week and she found a review on this place, so we tried it out. Great place. Very friendly knowledgeable staff and excellent food. I had the $16 fish and chips (frys).  light flaky crust with tender fish inside. very good. Everything is made on site, no frozen food. My wife had the pulled pork sandwich ($?), and house made chips. The pork was very good and the chips were wonderful. They had two sauces they brought with my fish. house made Tarter and a ketchup. both were very good, not your usual condiments (they had regular ketchup if you wanted it). Limited selection of Booze, lots of Scotch, and a nice selection of beer."}
{"text":"In Brief: Food was good, being rushed out was not. 

I went to the Queen and Beaver Public House tonight with three friends.  I made my reservation via email earlier this week and was told by Jamieson, \"Yes, I can take you.\" 

I was the first to arrive at the restaurant and I was seated by a gentleman (who I assume was Jamieson but am not 100% sure.) Two of my friends arrived relatively quickly but the fourth was running a bit late.  It didn't take long before our waitress began asking us for drink orders. That was fine, it's pretty typical to get greeted quickly after being seated.

The three of us ordered drinks and some items off of the bar menu while we waited for our friend to arrive. The food and drinks came very quickly. The fourth friend had just taken off her coat when our waitress was hovering around her asking her for a drink order. 

The food and atmosphere were great, they were actually the only positives of the night. It was clear as the night progressed that we were being rushed, although we had no idea why. I thought the restaurant was just really efficient since it was a busy Friday night. 

We ordered starters and when they arrived my friend asked if we could get bread for the table. Our waitress said that she'd bring some but it never made it to us.

We had our mains and everyone was really happy with their meals (3 of us ordered the chicken tarragon with the fourth getting a chicken pot-pie type dish.) Not long after having our entree dishes cleared, our waitress reappeared with dessert menus. That's when the night's fun began to dampen. 

\"Did Jamieson speak to you at all?\" Our waitress asked. We informed her that he hadn't. She let us know that they had a large group of 19 coming to the restaurant at 9pm and they were going to be seated in the section we were in. \"But you can definitely still order desserts!\" We looked at our watches, it was 8:50.

\"Can you seat us anywhere else?\" I asked. We were having a great time catching up as we hadn't see each other in awhile. We certainly weren't ready to call it a night. 

\"I'll check,\" our waitress said. 

A few mintues later she reappeared letting us know we weren't being rushed out, since groups of 19 don't always arrive altogether. 

\"Can you seat us anywhere else?\" I asked again. She confirmed that no, there weren't any available tables. 

We did order desserts and two coffees (one for myself, one for someone else). While we were having our desserts, we had to watch as the wait staff brought extra chairs and tables into the area. It was a bit uncomfortable, to say the least. We definitely felt like we were being rushed out.

I couldn't finish my coffee as it was too strong but my friend finished hers to find a thick sludge coating the bottom and side of her cup. We pointed that out to our waitress and she chocked it up to the French press. (I've never seen that much coffee grind left in a cup from a French press.)

We asked for separate bills and the waitress' body language clearly showed she was irritated by that. When we were ready to pay, she surprisingly took awhile to return to our table. 

While waiting for the waitress to come back, I asked if anyone else was uncomfortable and we all were. The chairs we were sitting on were very hard and definitely not meant for long-term seating. (Be sure to bring a pillow if you're going to be seated a while.)

We paid our bills and left, disappointed and annoyed at how quickly our nice evening had turned sour. I looked up the email and confirmed that Jamieson never mentioned that we'd only be able to stay for 2 hours. And I definitely wasn't told about it when initially seated.

My friends and I were having a great night and in the span of ten minutes, we were all annoyed."}
{"text":"Good portions, and really cool atmosphere.

However the food is trying a bit too hard. British fare is a wonderful base to be expanded upon but the dishes I saw and tasted were over reaching. Almost everyone I saw eat did not seem to finish more than 1/3rd of the meals, including myself. It would be so awesome if the drinks stayed the way they are (however their Ceaser is pretty much all vodka) but lowered the price of the food and brought it down a notch. I'd love to see some more traditional options done very well with a home rustic feel. 

I feel like they are paying a lot into rent and to things like their personalized napkins, but if they lowered the prices a bit and made the food more approachable with the twist they've come to know, it would be a constant hang out. Maybe their vision is just above my head, but I'd pay more for better food not \"fancier\"."}
{"text":"I came here after dinner (at Elm Tree, just next door), and had drinks with a friend on the second floor lounge. The first floor is more for dining, and the second floor is more casual: There was a sports game playing on the large screen, some tables and couches. They have a patio too, I guess it would be a great place to sit when it's warmer out.

I was really comfortable there, the noise level was perfect for having a conversation (no yelling necessary!). I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Really cool pub in Toronto. They have an upstairs dimly lit pub lounge - low key which is nice. Real gem is the outdoor rooftop area to have a pint"}
{"text":"This place is like going to your grandma's for a meal. I mean that in a good way! I've come back a few times now. The decor is cosy, and spacious with lots of quirky knickknacks to admire. The service is friendly but unlike your grandma - not nosy. And  the food always hits the spot. Its comforting, delicious and unpretentious. 
Try the savory pies -divine!  Most things under 'Bar menu- favourite' were great.  Burgers and fries are pretty good as are their home made ice cream.  
Decent beer and wine collection.

Its great for groups just be sure to make reservations ahead of time. 
Definitely plan return when the weather warms up to check out the rooftop patio."}
{"text":"Updated ****we went again and were not disappointed!  The menu had a changed and we got to try different dishes, and everything was top notch. This might become one of our favorites for when's we travel in Toronto. Thanks! 

Stumbled upon this place walking around for supper, do not regret it at all. Not all the typical British dishes were available but what is on their menu is excellent and their beer list is good too. Good service as well. Definitely worth stopping in."}
{"text":"The Queen and Beaver Public House is a British themed gastropub, serving up traditional English classics in a cozy British decor to match the part. While they certainly have an a la carte dinner menu, they also have a special feasting menu, which allows everyone at the table to share a family-style meal. The cost is based on the number of people you have, and the price includes the roast of your choice, potatoes, and seasonal vegetables (drinks excluded).

Before dinner is served, each person receives their own setting of china and heavy silver cutlery. I love the plates here. Each one had a different design, but like everything else in the restaurant, they all fall under the same elegant Victorian theme.

Being an extremely cold evening, the meal was extra cozy. The Venison Stew with Cheddar Scones($24 per portion) was so comforting with its tender chunks of venison, hearty button mushrooms, shallots, and thick gravy. The Roast Ribeye of Bison ($36 per portion) was also phenomenal. It's fully cooked on the edges, while still maintaining a red center and perfect tenderness throughout. My tummy just grumbled recalling this plate of food!

This cozy home style meal ended with a couple desserts which we shared. After all the giggling, we shared the Spotted Dick, a traditional British dessert of cake and currants. The dessert is named after Richard, hence the humorous nickname.

The dessert winner for me was definitely the Tafferty Pie. The pie's thin layers kind of remind me of puff pastry, but are actually a composition of extremely thin apple slices encased in a pie cust. The cinnamon ice cream was also THE perfect coupling, which was only made more amazing with the addition of crunchy maple syrup bits. Easily the best apple pie-like dessert I've ever had."}
{"text":"a great place to try an eclectic combination of foods.  if you like a decadent meal, ignore the primary menu on the front page, turn over the menu to the tasting side and then just order one of each.  you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I was attending a conference at the Delta Chelsea and walked across the street for lunch at The Queen & Beaver. We sat at tables out front and increased our party from 6 to 12 people within a few minutes after sitting down because a few more friends walked by looking for lunch.  They weren't really busy at that point and the staff just rolled with the flow.  

The restaurant had a nice selection of beer.  I had the hamburger made from chopped sirloin.  Outstanding! The fried were thin and crispy.  Everyone's food looked great.  The custard pie was wonderful.

We stayed a couple of hours and it was a wonderful time.  My favorite meal while in Toronto."}
{"text":"I usually don't write a review unless I'm being very impressed... and let me tell you this pub is definitely one of them. It's been a while since I've been to a beautiful cozy place with awesome awesome service and delicious food. Every detail about this place in phenomenal and beyond expectations. I will absolutely go back"}
{"text":"Some of the staff were unbelievably rude! Once they made sure of the 18% forced tip for large parties, you could see they're having an attitude.

In addition, their service was awful, we had to ask 3 or 4 times for anything we needed, they couldn't even get the number of silverware sets right! 4 minutes and 3 reminders later, one of us finally got her set, to start the almost cold brunch!

The portions are tiny. Nothing special in taste or quality either."}
{"text":"Classy joint - second floor patio has a great atmosphere but is small, so go early to grabs a table. I prefer The Oxley, as there is a bit more room and the location is nicer, but really you can't go wrong with either one."}
{"text":"Nice interiors, very British antique feel. Service was very good and quick.

Ordered Fish and Chips, it was \"okay\", not bad but not great."}
{"text":"We decided to try the Queen and Beaver on a whim for Sunday brunch. We've been told that the was good, and were pleasantly surprised that it was fantastic. The Moroccan pulled lamb sandwich was subtle yet flavorful and the pancakes with ice cream were simply amazing. 

The only thing surpassing the food was the impeccable service. Only near the end of our brunch, did we find out that is was our server Laura's first day! If she is a reflection of the Queen and Beaver's staff and the quality they bring to their job, this restaurant is an absolute must for everyone that enjoys next-level dining experiences, or just likes to eat or just likes being happy. 

Stop reading this review. Go there now!"}
{"text":"My favorite gastropub in Toronto! Food and drinks are a bit expensive, but I can gloss over that because the food is really very good. I'm working my way through the menu and I haven't been disappointed yet. 

Something to try is their Sunday feast! It's a traditional British meal, served family style, and like the rest of the food, its fantastic. Note, you need at least 6 people and have to book a couple days in advance"}
{"text":"Have to say, a little bit disappointed. I had heard so many great things but food and pricing were a bit off tonight. I had the prime rib and for 26 bucks, expected a bit more than I got. Rabbit was quite unremarkable as well. Oh well, possibly an off night.

Great beer options though and patio was lovely. Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place.  It has a great atmosphere and the decor is awesome.  It's a very classy English place.  

The menu is very small,  they don't have a lot of items but that's OK.  The menu is also very English (e.g. Rabbit,  fish and chips,  etc.)

The food is actually very good and isn't too pricey.  The beer selection is fairly decent as well.  The second floor is more of a lounge area and the main floor is more of a dinner area.  

I'd like it if they could add more items to their menu."}
{"text":"I didn't have any food here, so I'm going to be generous and give this place 3 -stars. I don't understand why this place has such high reviews, unless the food is amazing or something... 

The bar itself wasn't bad, but it wasn't really anything special- Nothing in the atmosphere that would particularly draw me back again. 

Things that bothered me about the bar were:
-Really expensive (like, $10 pints)
-Washrooms were kind of dirty (Not disgusting, but I expect more from a place that has $10 pints)
-Last call was at 12:30 on a Friday night - seriously?!

Maybe I'll go back during the day and try the food, but it's definitely the kind of bar that you order one pint at and call it a night!"}
{"text":"I found the pulled lamb sandwich very disappointing and overpriced. I did like the atmosphere and would go back for drinks, but not for the food."}
{"text":"Overall I feel like this is a nice place to catch up with a group of friends over an interesting meal-- the atmosphere is homey and relaxing, and completely conducive to maintaining conversations. It's not super quiet, but friendly and social. However, after coming here twice and hearing the opinions of some friends who have come here as well, I've come to the conclusion that this place is very hit-or-miss in terms of food. 

The Queen and Beaver menu appears to be comprised of \"polished\", upscale versions of British pub meals. I visited this place a few years ago, and I absolutely loved what I had there. I remember it being some sort of meat pie. A friend and I caught up over a nice leisurely meal and I left the restaurant feeling that It was amazing, and I couldn't wait to go back. But being a student at the time, and keeping in mind that this place has not-so-modest prices for full meals, I never ended going back until today, and I feel a little let down.

I had a slice of wild mushroom pithivier and their Original Sin cocktail which is made with elderberry liqueur. The wild mushroom filling was a little on the salty side, and the pie was mostly filled with potato, but otherwise the pithivier was decent tasting. The side salad it came with had a vinaigrette that was very acidic and a little unappealing, and, keep in mind I adore elderberry, my cocktail tasted a little medicinal. Maybe I just hyped up the place too much in my memory but this time I felt that my meal with overpriced and had imbalanced flavours. 

My boyfriend had an even worse experience. He ordered a lamb dish which was bland, mushy, and unappealing. He was very disappointed with his meal, but didn't find it inedible so didn't send it back.

I came in with very high hopes today, but this hit-or-miss experience prevents me from giving this place a 4/5 like I originally wanted to, and unfortunately my experience was just \"okay\" instead of great."}
{"text":"Came here to try one of Toronto's \"best burgers.\"  I would really classify it as more of a steak sandwich.  The burger is chopped sirloin and comes with cheese and bacon.  There are no lettuce or tomatoes and the condiments offered are ketchup and hot mustard.  I found the sirloin to be fatty and chewy.  The bun was nice.  We came mid afternoon and it was not very busy but service was not very attentive.  Fries were great and we had the sticky toffee pudding which was delicious.  The upper patio is really nice."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Our waitress was fabulous and her recommendations made the dinner top drawer.  Sitting outside on the top terrace added to the experience.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went to the Queen and Beav (that's my new nickname for it) on a casual date one night, being told by my date that it was a great place. I was sad that the old restaurant 35 Elm was no longer there, as it used to be my standard after work date restaurant, but really it was lame, and the Beav is great.

It took way too long to get an old-fashioned - apparently waiting 5 minutes for a cherry (?) but the Brit in me knows I should've stuck with a pint so it serves me right. After waiting for a patio table in the comfy leather armchairs upstairs, we were brought out to the 2nd floor patio. 

I went with the ploughman's, but wasn't a fan of the homemade pickle - the whole meal was a bit too pickley for me, but my friends dinner and homemade crisps were delightful. We had two very attentive servers who made us feel very comfy as well.

Unrelated to the service or food, I swear I knew one of the servers (did we date at some point??) so I was entertained in addition to everything else.

The patio provides a nice view of Elm Street as well as possible debauchery sightings in the Delta Chelsea hotel right next door - alas we caught none. Elm Street is a great little hideaway street with other good spots."}
{"text":"Great room
Great service
Great hangover breakfast
I'll be back for sure..."}
{"text":"This is an excellent pub for one or two pints after work. I went on a Tuesday night and it was full of corporate types, but still quite cozy. The bottom is a restaurant, and the upstairs is more lounge-like with big couches/chairs and tables. They mostly have imported (British) beers on tap, plus Steamwhistle. I didn't eat there (not vegetarian at all), but the food looked like pretty high-quality pub food. It's a bit expensive. I think the burgers are the cheapest (and looked quite fancy), but most mains are around $17. I would definitely recommend for a few drinks."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at the hype over this place. I'll preface by saying I've only eaten here once, but it was such a bad experience that I will not return. I ordered a lunch steak last Friday and asked for it medium. It was served on some toast (strange) and was pre-cut into five grey chucks. The colour was so off-putting, but I chose to eat it because my friend was treating me and I didn't want to be rude. It was the worst steak I've ever had. 

I wish I took a photo of it just to illustrate the grotesqueness, but again I didn't want to offend my friend who likes this restaurant (for some unknown reason)."}
{"text":"If Hannibel Lechter had a favorite pub in Toronto, this would be it. 

The Queen and Beaver is a gastropub and that means instead of greasy nachos and wings, you get lamb's tongue and ham knuckle terrine prepared by a proper chef.  Frat boys looking to chug Molson Canadian, move on. This is a place for quaffing hard-to-find draught brews like Czechvar Pilsner and a less fizzy, \"gently-chilled\" cask ale ($7 a pint).  All in a charming townhouse oozing with character.

You'll get the delicious tongue and terrine in the Ploughman's Platter which also included house-made pickled beets, red cabbage, silverside of beef, aged cheese, pork pie, and \"crisps\" made from scratch. (Skip the mushy pickled endive. It's the one that looks like afterbirth on the plate.)  At $26, this was a whole lotta nosh easily shared by the seven of us who gathered for the Yelp event.

The menu has Brit faves like black pudding and fish 'n chips, but also more inspired snacks like grilled sardines and anchovy pate on toast. ($12). It turned out to be a gynormous canape that I had to eat with a fork and knife. But I love how that knife is a schmancy Laguiole knife, and all the plates are mismatched china.

And they even have the really plush paper towels in the bathroom--the kind you're not sure if you're supposed to toss or launder. Hey, that's class all the way."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding. Some (1 person) may have complained about this pub but I can see absolutely no reason why. 

My girlfriend and I stopped in for dinner at 8pm. Quite simply, nothing could have been better.  The service was excellent -  our server Sean couldn't have been more helpful or polite and was around to answer our questions but was never in the way. 

And now onto the food... 

Just try the Sticky Pork Steak.. It's the best dish on the menu.  And it's brilliant. As is the wine selection and the Cornish cider, which accompanies it perfectly. 

Try this pub. Ignore the whinging sods who think that it isn't good enough for their unique requirements. It's well worth a visit!!!"}
{"text":"Went for Saturday brunch. Excellent room, great staff, phenomenal food. Best pancakes I've ever had."}
{"text":"My experience was great.  I ate upstairs by myself, as I was on a business trip, and surfed the Internet on my iPad on their free wi-fi.  The owner was nice enough to come by and share some good conversation while I waited for my Tukesberry Chicken.  The meal was great.  The staff very friendly and the atmosphere young, upbeat and relaxing.  I stu bled upon this place and am glad I did.  I went in not having heard anything about it and left a big fan."}
{"text":"When I heard that we were spending the evening at the Queen and Beaver, my first thought was: \"Queens *and* beavers?  Talk about something for everyone!\"  As I soon discovered, however, the Queen and Beaver is not an entertainment venue but a pub--and a damned nice one.  

The bar itself is small and too close to the entrance but the appropriately dark and sedate dining areas were just the place for a relaxing meal, ribald conversation, and the occasional inebriated donkey laugh.  Although I admit to some sticker shock when I opened the menu, I quickly moved past it and settled on the curry, which was very tasty, as were the fries I snatched (still thinking about beavers) off my dining companions' plates.  Speaking of plates, one part of me thought that the mismatched charity shop/grandma's house crockery was a nice touch but given the price of a meal, the rest of me decided that management could afford a matching set.  All told, I'd happily to return to the Queen and Beaver.  

Pssst (or should I say \"piss\"?): The gents' urinals display a refreshing bit of whimsy, definitely something not to be . . . um . . . missed."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and the client recommended this place.  If you're looking for a good burger, get the one here!  It's chopped sirloin, not ground, and it shows.  You have your choice of Stilton Blue Cheese or Cheddar and it comes with bacon on a daily baked bun.    It was soooo good!!  One of the best burgers I've ever had.  The meat is so flavorful you don't need anything on it.  Oh and the beer, the beer!  Have a pint of hand drawn bitters from an old style tap.  Run, don't walk!  Get there posthaste and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I went here today during lunch time for the first time. I went here because my friend recommened and told me its top five brunch restaurant but REALLY? i dont think so. The food was alright but Service quality was very LOW. WORST ever. I think the waitress serve customer by their looks. She was really nice to other tables beside us but she never came to us asking how are everything. WORST. I wont recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"The good: Great atmosphere, love hanging out here on a Sunday afternoon.

The bad: The suits & after work crowds. The food is a little too authentically English for my taste, if you know what I mean. And finally, the beer. They have a few interesting choices, and a bunch of head-scratchers."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for dinner, drinks, as well as brunch. The experience has always been pleasant and I'll gladly come back. It's one of the very few places downtown that actually serves proper full english breakfast, too."}
{"text":"Great spot! Very cozy vibe, friendly and knowledgable staff, food was phenomenal I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"This is an upscale pub, and I must say I find the downstairs area is raher clinical at the present time, does not have the feel of a typical British pub. However, while a little expensive the lunch menu is also upscale and certainly very tasty and the portion size adequate for my size of appetite. However, some people might find the portions rather small for the price.
Will return to try a weekend brunch, and also the upstairs lounge one evening."}
{"text":"This was maybe my 6-7th time here. Had been at the place for the World Cup quite abit and the food never disappoints and I love their UK sytle breakfast. Definately alittle more pricey then your average pub but its worth it. I had the fish and chips this time around which were super tasty and served up with some really cool dips. One a spicy curry one and the other a tangy sorta green dip. Fries were good also. Definately worth the 17 dollars and definately filling. Added a couple of rum and cokes and the experience was ace. Went with a group of five and the service was fast, courteous and efficient. We sat in the main dining room downstairs to avoid the heat but I hear their patio upstairs is quite nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I wen in for some drinks and they had a good selection.  We will be back to try the food."}
{"text":"Regular food but great seating and decorating ... And if the weather is good go for the patio :)"}
{"text":"The main reason I came to the Queen Beaver is to try out the supposed 'best Toronto on this side of town' burger.

I was pleasantly surprised by the quaint and collegiate like surrounding - the main floor had a huge teapot dresser (alas, I forgot to take a picture) while the upstairs had a huge sofa room with bookcase (too cool - I must return just to sit on that couch ONE MORE TIME). They also had an upstairs patio that was nice and quiet on a Sunday afternoon (almost made me think it was time for an afternoon nap). 

The service was good though I was slightly confused when I first entered (there were no waiters around). However, when we seated ourselves on the patio, we were greeted promptly with menus and an explanation of what was available. I already knew what I wanted so I just had to pick a beer - I believe I chose the cream ale. It was decent but I am old school - give me a Sleeman and I will be content.

Now, onto the food ... is this the best burger I ever tasted? Were the fries good? What about that intriguing homemade ketchup - did it knock my socks off?  No - no - no. Sorry but I speak the truth. The burger did not have enough oomph for me and it really just tasted like some kind of chopped up pot roast. I could barely taste the stilton - are we being stingy or what!!??! The fries were not crispy enough (I like mine double fried please). And for pete's sake - give me Heinz. 

Maybe I need to refine my British pub fare tastebuds. I am willing to return to re-experience the dinner menu. But heck, I am just laying it out as it is people ... I was not that impressed. Pictures look good tho."}
{"text":"My wife and I came by upon recommendation of others last Friday. There were people there, but not too busy. 

We went inside and waited. And waited. And waited. So we went upstairs. Full and full of people watching soccer. That's fine.

We went back downstairs and tried to figure out if we should get a table or wait. Still no one came by. Eventually someone came and asked if we were going to sit or not. She took us to a table, but after she left, we decided to take our business elsewhere. The ambiance was cute, but the lighting was too strong for a pub,and the service just did not cut it. 

The descriptions of the food looked good, but if the service isn't even there (does it exist?), how it tastes doesn't matter."}
{"text":"I dough not know what happened here.... we ordered the Grilled Ontario Lamb Fat,  although the menu reads \"Chop\" , but this is clearly just a misunderstanding, as it was quickly pointed out by the staff. Apparently we dough not know what a Lamb chop looks like, but look it up in the book... \"Lamb Chop:  A small cut of fat from a lamb, including part of the rib and more fat\". 
This is just a complete load of bobbins !!!!  
On the other hand... the Tewkesbury Brick chicken was deemed as \"lovely\" by a female member of our group, so... there is that...

A positive is that the place is really cozy, they force you to sit other people on your lap, which is sometimes nice, If you're into that.

The patio is very nice for wearing short shorts on summer nights while eating bananas without chewing and making eye contact with strangers just before gagging.

I'm not going to forbid this place, but beware of the lamb fat !!!"}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, with a beautiful old English charm. The staff are what you would expect at a posh restaurant rather than a pub, amazing; very knowable about the food and drink. I have eaten at their sister pub The Oxley many times also and not once have I had a bad experience. The food is rustic and delicious. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service, there is not much to say beyond that. The rabbit and pork pie was very moist and succulent. The fish and chips were fairly standard, but done well!

I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We arrived here and decided to order some sides before our friends got here. We ordered the fries with a curry/cumin ketchup, pork scratchings and the whelks with aiole sauce. We were blown away by the equality and flavour and couldn't wait to order the mains. I ordered the lamb chop. What a disappointment! There was a bone cross through it which made it really difficult to get the meat off and the flavour just wasn't there. The accompaniment were beans and greens that I've still to identify. Beans were barely cooked with breadcrumbs and the greens were tough and bitter. My friend had the rib eye steak and fared slightly better. Suffice to say the mains came nowhere near the promise of the sides we started with. So disappointing. The atmosphere was great although it did get loud later on and our waiter was helpful and attentive. Good beer selection too. Maybe I caught them on a bad day but I'd think twice about returning. Thanks for reading this far!"}
{"text":"Came here today for the weekend brunch.  I didn't read through the reviews first but the ratings where high so thought we would give it a try.  I am not familiar with British cuisine so this was very interesting for me.  I ordered the full breakfast as it seemed like an opportunity to try a few different things.  I enjoyed the ambience and the service was great.  I didn't love the food personally but it's a personal taste for sure.  My friend loved it and I can appreciate that everything was made in house and they put a lot of effort into their food.  I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys British food.  The blood pudding ... I just couldn't try it.  The eggs toast sausage and tomato were great.  The beans were okay.  I am not a fan of baked beans so that's a personal thing."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm downtown and not sure what to eat this place ends up serving as my go-to.

A true gastro-pub, the Queen and Beaver does proper English food (with an Ontario local bent) and does it well enough that you will begin to wonder why England was ever seen to have a poor culinary reputation.

The menu changes with every season but everything I have ever had here is great (with the possible exception of the steak, which was slightly tough). 

My favourite dishes are the wood fire baked meat pies (especially the venison, rabbit and pheasant ones depending which are in season), the burger (served bloody with bacon and either stinky blue or super aged cheddar), and the sausage, gravy and mashed potatoes.

Beer selection is small but smart and always includes a cask ale (although it would be nice if they switched up from the Arkell bitter once in a while).

In short, go here any time you to grab a pint or two along with an unpretentious but delicious spot of stick-to-your ribs comfort food. 

4.5/5."}
{"text":"Really liked the burgers. Don't usually order burgers and was pleasantly surprised. The salad was decent as well. Would go back!"}

{"text":"A great little restaurant. Nothing particularly special, but the food and drinks here are consistently good and fairly priced. I recently had the salmon and was blown away by how great it tasted -- moist, flavourful and just the right amount of crunch. I would recommend the Queen and Beaver as a great place for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Great place super nice terrasse on the first floor. Great choice of Ontario Beers. Service impeccable. Rebecca with British accent"}
{"text":"Was there over lunch hour and experienced rude, slow service (even for lunch hour) - was rudely dismissed and laughed at when asking for an upstairs patio table and was not offered another option.  Left standing their awkwardly had to suggest another table ourselves.  Seating and ordering drinks & food seemed greatly like we were inconveniencing the staff.  In addition, it is WAY over-priced mediocre food.  In the downtown core where pub food and patios are a dime a dozen, I wish I had save myself the $$$ and left this leaf unturned.  Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The Queen and Beaver on a Thursday night had the best service of  my entire Toronto trip. The halibut was expensive and small.  However the halibut was perfectly cooked with great sides. My server was attentive and never asked \"how is it?\" when your mouth is full. He skipped the chit chat and always filled our water. When my alcoholic drink was empty he arrived and didn't over sell.
 
I didn't want to go to the restaurant because I didn't want pub food. I was amazed at the drink selection, food quality and service.

Very satisfied and the bill was reasonable for drinks and food."}
{"text":"Amazing 2nd floor patio. Nice and quiet/secluded and decent service. There are huuuuge TVs inside so great for watching the games."}
{"text":"I went to the Queen and Beaver for a late dinner, and was pleased by the selection of beers and of traditional (and interesting) British pub fare. I settled on fish and chips and was pleased to find a healthy portion of both, with a tartar sauce that appeared to be homemade.

The prices are a little out of line for the area of the city and the class of food served, but the decor, atmosphere, and general feeling of attention to detail more than make up for that. Overall, a great place for a weeknight stop!"}
{"text":"And very close to 5 stars. We're visiting from Boston and found this place in hopes of a good English menu. The eggs on scones was delicious and the fish and chips were cooked perfectly. Loved it and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"A close friend of mine needed a space to throw a party to celebrate her SO adding a bunch of letters to the end of his name, and she chose Queen and Beaver.  We needed a space that people could casually drop in, but we could all sit and chat and hang out and drink nice wine, or whatever bevvies you like. 

She contacted Q & B, and luckily got a large area reserved on the top floor. Super charming, well decorated. The vibe here is a perfect balance of classy and casual. We had 20 something people in our party and every one could mix, mingle and lounge as they pleased. 

I didn't sample any of the food as I came from dinner, but I got to long enviously at a couple of my friend's plates. A little on the pricey side, yes, but the upscale pub environment was perfect, and very comfortable. The upstairs room is a must. 

Only thing is they shut the bar down before 1 (on a Sat) so if you like to party into the wee hours, you will have to relocate then."}
{"text":"Excellent roof deck atmosphere, quirky vintage interior.  Had the lamb curry which was pleasantly spicy but a bit gritty as sort of.a.citrus curry paste gone a wry.  Will try again though as the atmosphere and service were great.  Perhaps the duck...n"}
{"text":"I was at there may 5th at 12:30 in the afternoon and i had Worst experience. Server wasn't unkind. I asked about popular menu, but she just said \"hamburger and chips\" after few minute other customer came and they asked about menu and she explain them specific.. What the...?
Because i am asian? Or i am younger than other customers? I was feeling so bad. I will never recommend this place, stupid server working."}
{"text":"Q&B is my favorite pub in the city, which is strange given it's ghastly location. Actually though. 

The first time I dined here was at the request of my BF who loves upscale pubs. I was more than pleasantly surprised! Not only could I get fish and chips, but I could get cocktails that are not usually found at pubs (MINT JULEPS!). All and all, this place has great drinks, very well executed food, and great service. 

They also have a dope patio, 2 of them actually. If you're looking for a pub, stop, and go here instead.. it's much better than the rest of the crap out there."}
{"text":"a wonderful place to take your time over some rustic freshly prepared food. try the potted duck and wild cherries with a cask beer. like a time machine for your taste buds. most welcomed."}
{"text":"'Twas naught a year ago, and the place was silent and still. 
It felt like the invasion of someone's empty (albeit quaint) townhouse. With a creak, I opened the front door. I peered 'round. Grasping the shrunken wrists of my comrade in arms, we meandered through the rooms of the ground floor. From my voice came a booming yell: \"Hellloooo?????!!\". Once. Twice. Thrice. By the third time, She popped her head over the stairwell edge, like a bumblebee emerging from a bloom, and urged us upstairs into her abode. The hum and \"Hoooo!\" of the television set to a proper football match filled the hollow atmosphere as we settled in for a pint or two. 

She'd done well with the place. The aged leather couches sunk with use but held well - the sign of a quality craftsmanship. The mood was serious, yet optimistic. As she shuffled behind the bar and topped off another complex blend of hops 'n barley, I could see the wisps of her hair grazing her brow, like the lines of history dancing along the notes of her service. This place, this, Queen & Beaver, was more than just a hallow of merriment. 

This was her own private public house."}
{"text":"This place has a restaurant on the first floor and lounge/pub upstairs.

The pub has a great atmosphere. There are couches and a large tv with sports on. 

Beer selection is not super wide but the atmosphere is worth it. 

We've been here a few times over time and the menu has changed but continues to be English themed. The food quality is good. We found the brunch options were a  little too heavy and a little salty (eggs Benny and the q&b bacon butty) 

I recommend a visit here to chill with friends."}
{"text":"I had one of the best salads I've ever had here (arugula and rye breaded goat cheese). The sticky toffee putting was also amazing. It's obvious there's a classically trained chef working here. Our server was also prompt and friendly. Great ambience in the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant for great beer or excellent food.  Fantastic ambiance and a great selection of English beers on tap.  There is a great deal of outside seating and food was outstanding.  I had a pork belly sandwich that I am still dreaming about.  Sandwiches were decently priced and entrees were maybe slightly expensive, but considering the quality they seem well worth it.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice British style restaurant and the food and decor is great. My wife and I very much enjoyed our time here. The prices are not cheap but once you sample the food the money spent is worth it. Staff were very polite. If you want a small homey place to eat check this place out."}
{"text":"If you want great food, a lovely decor, amazing staff, and a wonderfully stocked bar, then please visit the Queen and Beaver.

This restaurant has a high standard for their food and make delicious meals from a traditional English brunch to the Sunday supper.

The decor is charming. With two spacious balconies, it is easy to find yourself not wanting to leave. One of my favourite spots is the big round table upstairs. The best way to spend a rainy day is at that table with some good friends.

They also have an impressive bar. They are one of the few places in the city which carry cask ales (also excellent on a rainy day) and they make a mean Pimm's cup.

Despite all of these amazing qualities the biggest asset of the place is the staff. Eric and Sasha upstairs will always deliver excellent service along with quick wit and charm. Even on the busiest days, this delightful duo will ensure you are well taken care of. The helpful (not to mention handsome) manager is also very attentive and not afraid to lend a hand.

This public house is real jewel.

Bravo!

Things to try: The Fish and Chips, Sunday Supper, Smoked Salmon on Rye and of course a ginger Pimm."}
{"text":"Mission: Summer Patio 
This patio is intimate and provides a very nice atmosphere for parties up to 4. Lots of sun and cool air due to the trees that are nearby. 

The drink selection is fairly large for both beer and wine, approved by my bartender friend(noted that they grow their own chocolate mint for the mojitos!). Tried their fuller London pride and one of their ciders, paired amazingly with their aged cheddar and tomato sandwich. Service here is great as they provide lots of time to soak up the sun and relax with close friends! Definitely coming back. =D"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Used to love coming here but the last time (in 2013) was ruined by horrible service. Our server was rude and condescending. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This pub is in an old two story home and feels like a home when you walk in. It has a feel of a study, or a common area of library at a university.  the patio is quaint  and the sun hits you just right.  

The menu is pretentious and I LIKE IT.  It makes sense an compliments the amazing beer selection. I am not a fan of canadian beer menus, but this menu provided some great english ales and creamy stouts.  The beer/food pairing was spot on.  The service was friendly and informed.  She tried everything on the menu and could speak to what she enjoys and what her peers enjoyed based on pallets.   Overall, a great place to try something new or just hang with friends on the couches and enjoy a pint.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The decor and furniture makes it feel like you're enjoying a pint in your grandmother's living room, but that's not a bad thing - it's cozy and comfortable. Great little spot for pints and/or upscale pub food.

My friend and I shared the lamb curry and the fish and chips. The curry was a-ok - but nothing to get too excited about. The fish and chips, however - let me tell you! The fries were thick, crispy and dusted with a perfect amount of salt. I'm slightly embarassed to admit that not only did we accidentally drop half of our fish on the floor, but my stomach tried to convince my mind that \"it was still good\" and the 3 second rule should apply.  It's worth mentioning that our server offered to replace it (much appreciated). It's also worth mentioning that eating off of the floor of a restaurant is not something I'd normally consider- this should tell you just how good these fish and chips were.

We had the orange chocolate tart and the baileys prailene ice cream (home made). Try the ice cream - unexpectedly fabulous!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great for a drink. Food is overpriced and pretentious. $24 for a lamb curry? Nah. It was decent but wasn't any better than getting a lamb curry for half the price from a legit Indian take out. My friend also asked for her burger medium (being conservative just in case) and received a bloody slab of steak tartare sandwiched between a bun. Avoid this place at all costs unless you're just going for some chill dranks."}
{"text":"We came just before 9pm and a few items on the menu were unavailable. No problem. The items we did order were good. We had the Fish & Chips which was okay, the Burger which was really good, \"Cracklins\" that were ok (some were realllly hard), and some bread with cheese and meat as an appetizer that was good. Fries on both entrees came in a very generous serving. We tried some light Canadian beers that were also good. Good, but not great overall. The decor was nice. It needed something else to set it apart."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a jays game and sat upstairs to watch playoff hockey on thier TV and grab a meal. Had the radish, apple salad to start which was amazing! Then had the chop burger and chop fries that were to die for. Really great meal and great value. Would go back."}
{"text":"I went upstairs to the lounge and had a couple of beers. Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. Very unique and distinct pub that I will definitely visit again.

The only negative is that their bar food is terrible. Ordered some Welsh rabbit for $6 and it should have been at least twice as much food for the price. Taste wise it was just ok."}
{"text":"It's not very often that I get the urge to write an update less than three weeks after the original review, but there is just so much more to this place than the burger (although, in my opinion it's one of the best in Toronto and a must-try).

I came back with some friends to have our minds blown anew, and we weren't let down. The fantastic four (Vlad \"The Russian\" K., Joseph \"Hot on the Trail\" B., \"Dangerous\" Daniel D. and myself) had reunited just before Christmas to get in some good eats and pop Dan's QB burger cherry.

I learned two things about the Queen and Beaver that night that have made me love it even more and leave me dying to go back again and again. 

1. They change their menu every week! While there are longstanding offerings that likely never change (like the Scotch Egg or the Stilton Burger), they also offer new selections weekly. 

2. They offer a Sunday Roast menu - whole roast dinners for eight (or more), served family-style with the roast brought to the table for carve-it-yourself goodness! I haven't heard of another place in Toronto that does this, but I'm dying to try this one out.

On this particular visit, the Apple-cider Braised Pork Chop caught my eye, while Joe got into the Fish and Chips. Vlad grabbed the Burger for about the fourth time that week, and Dan was not given a choice in the matter.

Dan and Vlad were thoroughly satisfied with their burgers (see my last review for a more fulsome discussion of this ode to the cow). I tried a piece of Joe's fish and chips and was pleasantly surprised. Normally I like mine done old school, covered in thick greasy batter with a giant hunk of fish on the inside, but this light, flaky batter covering reasonable pieces of perfectly-cooked fish was a well-executed divergence from chip wagon tradition. 

My pork chop was beyond what I could have imagined - a giant centre-cut chop, about an inch thick and frenched for show. It lay on top of asparagus and delicious pea dumplings with more of these little delights scattered around the plate. The whole thing was drizzled with an apple-cider reduction. This is foodgasm territory. My chop was cooked to order (medium) but those pea dumplings were so good I didn't even touch it until I had almost entirely cleared my plate of veggies.

I was smugly satisfied this visit when I discovered the faintest crack in the Queen and Beaver's culinary armour: nobody I know likes their homemade ketchup! In my last review, I extolled the virtue of the chef for his efforts on such a front, but the ketchup thing just isn't working. As another reviewer noted, there's a reason Heinz is still in business so many years later.

For a gastropub, the draught list is short but sufficient to satisfy most tastes. On my last visit I drank Fuller's London Pride, a traditional rich British ale. This time around I went local and opted for McAuslan's St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout, a delicious dark stout that was sufficiently light in the belly that I could enjoy more than one.*

Service, as always, was delivered by a professional. The team here is knowledgeable, charismatic and attentive, and made our group feel welcome once again.

Pro Tip:  Be sure to check out the urinals in the men's room.

* But who's counting?"}
{"text":"There is much fodder when discussing the Queen and Beaver. Let's start with the food: it's a classic, English-style pub with all the fixings like Roast Beef, pork chops and bread pudding. The menu features something for everyone to enjoy, especially the desert menu. Service was quick for the quality of the meal which was quite satisfying. Our waitress was friendly as we would hope. 

The ambience may come across as confusing to most. The interior was beautiful, but the music was the issue at hand. Meandering from Flo Rida to Dean Martin to Bob Marley, this playlist was as eclectic as it gets. 

Nonetheless, the Queen and Beaver was an exceptional dinner spot in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and it's a great pub experience on a nice street in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love the Queen and Beaver for its meaty menu of re-invigorated pub food (devilled lamb kidneys! ham hock terrine! rabbit and potato pie!); its laid-back atmosphere, mismatched plates and all; the comfortable couches and big-screen TV upstairs; and (yes) the soccer nets in the urinals. It's one of my go-to spots for an after-work pint or a post-movie bite.

The other night, my (much) better half and I had a burger craving, so off we went to the Q&B. The burger was one thing I'd never tried, and it certainly sounds good -- hand-chopped top sirloin, with bacon and stilton, grilled to your specifications.  And... it was OK. Not outstanding. The medium-rare burger was more like medium, and the medium was definitely cooked medium-well. The chopped steak gives the burger nice texture, but it was missing the juiciness and deep flavour of a really great piece of grilled ground beef. The fries, also clearly hand-cut, could have been smaller and fried a bit longer. And the homemade curry ketchup? Uh-uh, pass the Heinz. We asked for mayo, and got a tiny bowl of indifferent white glop for 99¢. In a place that makes everything in house, it just seemed incongruous -- but I guess mayo on fries is Just Not English.

The McAuslan cream ale and the $2 scoops of homemade ice cream -- whisky and gingerbread, strawberry pepper, stilton, etc. - made up for the OK burger. But I think next time I'll order something less complicated, like... mmmmm... liver and bacon with cabbage!"}
{"text":"I heard through the Yelp Vine that there was a place downtown that had a very solid burger, possibly the best burger in Toronto.  That is one of the things that makes me sad about this fine city, the lack of a fantastic burger joint.  Even though this isn't a burger joint I had to find out what the fuss was about.

They gave us the option to sit downstairs or in the lounge and we chose the lounge.  That turned out to be a fantastic idea as they had couches and a large screen tv showing football!  I ordered the burger and headed to the washroom.  Guys, drink LOTS so you have to use the urinals!!!

After washing my hands (I'm no filthy Yelper) I headed to my table and awaited my burger.  The burger arrived and it looked awesome.  It's how I expect all pubs should serve up a burger; a home made burger patty on a bun with fresh cut fries.  They also came with a side of homemade ketchup which wasn't bad at all.  Definitely a lot less sugar than the bottle of Heinz.  

I started with the fries and they were solid.  I had a bite into the burger and it was a solid burger.  Not the best I've had this year but a very solid burger for the places I've tried in TO this year and definitely one of the better ones.  The problem is at $17 I won't be coming back often for it but something I definitely had to try.  I will probably have a shot at some of the other items on the menu in the feature though.

The staff were super friendly and attentive even though they forgot the extra homemade ketchup."}
{"text":"The lounge area reminds me of a pub in london, except with table service. The place has tons of small little tables and a big couch with coffee table, perfect for a small afternoon gathering with friends. The decor is a mix between bohemian and mid-century modern. 

In addition to the lovely atmosphere, The Queen and Beaver Public House has amazing food and drinks. I tried the stout and it was perfectly creamy and full of flavor. I also got an elderflower cocktail, and was also equally amazing. The burger is superb. They kobe beef instead of ground meet, making for a very unique and tasty burger. Their fries is possibly the best I ever had! 

Oh, and their homemade ketchup is amazing! 

Overall a lovely experience. More on the pricey side (18$ entrees and 12$ cocktails), but totally worth it if you are visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"Very nice.  Very good beer, and classy pub food.  I am no expert, but the food at least seems authentic British to the uninitiated.

Not to be confused with standard Toronto pubs - this is a place to dine, not a place to eat burgers and fries and share pitchers.

Can be somewhat hard to get a table at peak times, but the upstairs casual room can also be a great place for drinks and bar menu snacks."}
{"text":"Not someone who frequents pubs, but the ambiance of Queen and Beaver's space, the quality of its food and of course, its decent selection of drinks won me over. First off, the decor is plush, with tufted leather chairs lending, as is true to its name, a royal vibe perfectly finished off with a paintinf depicting its namesake. Though the options are limited for vegetarians, I did find a great mushroom pithiver that was well-portioned, accompanied by a zestfully seasoned salad. My dinning partner nabbed the handchopped burger done rare with stilton cheese and likened it to more a steak between two buns than anything else---a good thing, if you were wondering. The kitchen also makes a delightful secret recipe tomato sauce to go with fries, which I'm told, contains spices like fennel to give it an extra oomph. All in all, the only drawback I experienced is the price point, which for me means it's stowed under the file marked \"for occasional visits only\" vs. the file for \"top go-to spots.\" I will be back sometime to enjoy the patio though!"}
{"text":"I grub here 3-4 meals a week!

It has two floor, both floor has a bar.  Top floor has a big TV and couches.  It is much cozier upstairs, it is like a living room, with a bar.  It also have outdoor seatings on both floors.  Downstairs is boring.

I brunch here often.  I love their Eggs Benedict.  They are not the traditional kind, they are put on top of cheese scones instead of muffins.  CHEATERS!  They added more calories to my unfit body as well as cream-my-pants-because-of-deliciousness factor.  It is a taste of heaven.  I felt bad ordering 2.

Their fish and chips is quite proper.  One whole cod instead of multiple pieces.  I love their fries as well.  Their draft beer collection is sizable, and they have cider!  You can find other traditional English grub here as well.  Black pudding, rabbit stew, veal chop, lamb pie, treacle tart, sticky toffee pudding.  You know it.

Get a party of 5 or more and go for a Sunday roast for brunch.  Gosh I wish I have 4 more friends.

From an expat once lived in London, this place is proper dog's bollocks.

The End."}
{"text":"Enjoyed brunch at Queen and Beaver today. One meal was the English Breakfast which looked substantial and delicious though I never eat eggs. My friend enjoyed it and left nothing on the plate!  His wife had the Eggs Benedict. One thing that I would have expected with this dish would have been some greens to balance off the meal and its presentation.  I had the BLT which is pork belly rather than bacon. This was delicious. I was initially disappointed that they had run out of fish and chips by noon but this was an excellent dish and I forgot about my first choice by the time it arrived.

The space is cosy and guests are encouraged to hang their heavy coats in the hallway so that there is more room to sit at the table.

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"There are things in life that are complex. And things that are simple. In sensual enjoyment of our world, the combination of these is most rewarding.

Thus Sweetbreads and Smoked Mushrooms on Toast. Tipped off earlier in the week, I tried this once. Enthralled, but suspicious of the moment, I tried it again. Happy to report it is real.

Imagine ( or just come and have ) a foundation of home made bread toasted ( based on the taste) over a wood fire. Lounging carelessly but elegantly over this a layer of sweetbreads, cooked to that perfect point of flavor and coherent texture without toughness. Their mates, smoked mushrooms ( who knew? ) tying the slightly wood char taste of the toast to the earthy flavor of mushroom to the subtle caress of the sweetbreads on the tongue.

And then the surprise that takes this great platform and elevates it - drunken blueberries that add their own earth flavor with a purple tint and a touch of sweetness buried in the forest taste and peeking out.

All of this in a perfect after work portion... And of course wrapped in this place's customary context of great and personable service. 

A glass of red and life is, in the moment, perfect."}
{"text":"Q&B has been on my list for awhile, and I finally had the opportunity to go. Service was great. Waiter was very friendly, helpful and attentive. We were sat in the downstairs area and I loved the decor.... pictures, portraits and memorabilia of our current and past queens. 

We had the welsh rabbit and another toast appie, and was disappointed with the size of the dish for the amount paid (yeah it's one piece of toast). As for the food, everyone agreed that it was salty (burger, and the duck/leek pie). No complaints on the fries/greens. Peanut butter ice cream was good but could have been creamier. I'll be honest, I just wasn't wowed and would give this place 2.5 stars. Rounding up because I'm willing to try it again and get something else off the menu..."}
{"text":"Very poor service. I had a burger (asked to be cooked medium well) and it came to me with the wrong cheese and it was cooked somewhere between rare and medium rare (it's steak, not burger, so technically does not have to abide by the provincial law of burger being cooked medium well.) I took one bite and it bled in my mouth and I was pretty thoroughly disgusted. I didn't even want them to cook it more because I was so perturbed. The burger my friend ordered was a medium and had much less pink than my \"medium well.\" We never got any drink refills even after asking, and there are absolutely NO vegetarian options unless you're into mushrooms, which is really disappointing because I like to avoid meat when I can, but I'm allergic to mushrooms. I'm from out of town and I was in Toronto for only one night and decided to visit a local business and let me tell you, it was pretty disappointing. Toronto has MUCH better pubs to offer."}
{"text":"The Queen and Beaver is a great spot tucked away in Elm Street. I dropped by with my family for lunch yesterday and we were all very impressed.

It's basically an upscale British pub and the decor and menu reflect that. I ordered the fish and chips, my parents ordered the BLT and smoked salmon and they were both very impressed.

I honestly think this was the best fish and chips I have had in a very long time (perhaps with the exception of Fresco's). The fish was perfectly battered and not too greasy, and came apart in flakes, not chunks as I was eating it. Yum! I absolutely love the fries here too, way better than the shoestring fries other restaurants serve. The curry chutney that comes with them is absolutely divine too.

The only disappointment was that they do not serve espresso-based coffee drinks, which I would think any decent pub/restaurant should be able to do by now. Other than that, a solid place for lunch and dinner. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I only went here to drink at night and fell in love with this place right away. It resembles a friend's living room. Tables and sofas everywhere, beer on tap was good as well (I'm from USA and we don't get a lot of Canadian beers). Has a nice big screen TV and was really comfortable overall. It was a good place to get together with good friends and talk, music, TV wasn't loud so you can actually hear each other."}
{"text":"Queen & Beaver is an outstanding pub!

Cask ale, fish & chips, pork belly BLTs, chopped steak burgers with marrow, fish cheek cakes, homemade crisps, a warm cozy feel, friendly staff, football on a big TV - who could ask for more?

I stopped by The Queen and Beaver PH for lunch with a colleague and had great cask ale (true English style) and perhaps the best BLT I have ever had the chance to wolf down. 

The meal consisted of pork belly bacon plus smoked tomatoes on a crusty bun with home-made crisps - my mouth is watering even writing this.  The whole experience was unique and one to remember.

I highly recommend this establishment. Eat downstairs for a more formal feel, upstairs for a more pub feel.  Either way, the unique menu and great environment will keep you coming back (it is so good I am looking at my calendar right now!)."}
{"text":"The Queen and Beaver became my favorite haunt during a two-night stay in Toronto. I ended up coming here THREE times - once for breakfast and twice for late-night drinks. The food is deliciously authentic and I loved the chill vibes of the upstairs lounge and terrace seating. I'm surprised this establishment hasn't been swarmed by hipsters yet. If I lived in Toronto I'd be a frequent patron. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I love this pub. I've been here many times and it always feels like home. I've tried both the downstairs and upstairs, and I much prefer the coziness of the upstairs area. There's bar seating, tables, and sofas up there as well as a tv in the middle of the room for when a game is on. I always seem to come on quiet nights when the tv is off though, which suits me just fine. 

I really like the food, though their snack items are a bit pricey for the small amount that you get. I'd recommend you just go for a main so that you're not still peckish after eating. The fish and chips are an obvious choice, but I've also had their wild mushroom pithivier which was also good. They carry blanche de chambly, which makes me happy."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  And I think it's the sister restaurant of The Oxley which I also like so it seems like this restaurant group knows how to please it's guests!

We went here for brunch on a recent Sunday with friends who had suggested it and we weren't disappointed.  The food, the service and the ambiance were just great.

I had the daily omlette of the day which was perfect.  My friend had the Sunday roast which was roast beef and my other friend had the pancake stack.  Know if you go that the pancake \"stack\" would be considered more of a side dish in the US .  It was small and didn't fill my friend up which was too bad given he even asked the server how large they were and then these little pancakes showed up.

No worries though.  The bloody Mary's were spicy and hot, the mimosas cool and sparking and my side of thick bacon made my day.

Love the way this restaurant group seems to re purpose old buildings as this was clearly a house at one time and we wee seated in what might have been a front room or porch back in the day.

A excellent choice for brunch in Toronto!"}

{"text":"Classy.

It's a pub that caters more to the over 30 crowd who don't want students and kids hanging around being obnoxious. It's more refined, quieter and more business casual than most pubs nearby.

Don't come hungry as the food menu is short and it's not big pub food, it's more snacks to accompany the pint of lager you're having. It's closer to a real British pub than most around. 

This is where I like to come for a nice drink after work where it's all business people and no louts."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a break after a lot of touring on foot around the city.  Best gin and tonic I've ever had!   We also ordered beer for my husband and ginger ale for the kids.  For a snack, we ordered the toe rags - how could you not?  Deep fried mashed potatoes, with some other ingredients, and a lovely mustard sauce.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Very nice, traditional English style pub.  Wait staff were attentive and well versed in their offerings.  They have cask all available!  The shepherd's pie was excellent, muscles were very nice (we would have liked some bread for the juice - not on them, we didn't ask).  Beautiful outside seating upstairs."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I had full intention of eating here.  Upon my arrival, I was warmly greeted, at grabbed a seat at the bar.  Unable to connect to their wifi (lots if excuses, blaming the old building), we had a few misunderstandings on the menu and what I did or did not order.  The bartender seemed to be more concerned with proving that he was right, versus just serving me and what I wanted to order.  I finally decided that this was not the place for me, and moved on.  Walking in, I wanted to love this place, but you have to meet me half way.  Just because I ask a few questions to get a better understanding of the menu
 items, doesn't mean I'm looking for a fight.  I just want dinner!  And I did get it, just somewhere else."}
{"text":"I know Queen and Beaver isn't your average pub- its full on Gastro-pub. I suggested my book club meet there to discuss an English book, because the Yelpers thought this place was the bees knees. 
When I arrived and sat on the hot patio, I needed a cool drink. Beer selection here was good, so I ended up with a refreshing wheat beer. 
For food, I didn't have a big selection. I ended up with the pot of smoked fish spread.  
If your an organ-eater, this place has your sweetbreads. But, otherwise, it's heavy food and not ideal for a hot summer afternoon. Service was only OK on the patio because the inside was so packed."}
{"text":"Thanks to Annie M. we stumbled across The Q&B for a little post-class drink. What a cool space! Head upstairs when you walk in, and choose either a comfy couch, arm chair or what feels like gathering around a kitchen table. This was just the right atmosphere to catch up with friends over some very unique beers. Quiet crowd but a good vibe!

Amongst our group we ordered some German wheat beer and a few types of cider. I had the Ontario Spirit Tree cider, which was delicious. A little pricey at $11 (taxes included), but a decent size at least. The menu was also fairly expensive, burger and fries for $17, and they didn't have a HUGE selection, but the food is supposed to be delish.

Next time I'd love to try the Canadian cheese platter (1 for $6 or 3 for $16), the frits OR their homemade icecream. Some of the flavours were Baileys-praline, raspberry ripple, and other delicious (and alcohol infused) frozen flavours!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were here for winterlicious last night.  It was an exceptional meal with service to match.  The food was very well done, my  pork was medium rare tender and cooked to perfection.  My wife said the puff Pastry was tough and chewy,  it's a tough one to get right.  The sticky pudding was a bit strong for my liking, and maybe a bit too sweet, but it was very good.  Usually I don't like this type of dessert and I ate mine and most of my wife's.  My wife said the meal reminded her of her Dads cooking when she was young, very traditional English and very good,  the only negative was that we were on the porch, it wasn't cold or uncomfortable, it was fine, we would have just preferred to sit where there was more ambience 
During summer and winterlicious we try a number of restaurants we wouldn't normally go to, because of distance, location, menu, and this is one that we will definitely be returning to for a date night, dinner with my wife's Dad or a good meal before the theatre.  
Would I recommend it, yes."}
{"text":"Great English gastropub and food. Will definitely come back. Very cute setting inside reminds me of London (England)."}
{"text":"My introduction to Toronto was hail. HAIL! Yes, I am a silly little Californian.

So I took refuge at Queen and Beaver and instantly began to relax. Cozy couches, check. TV, check. Corner library, check. Beer on tap, check. I'm a sucker for brunch so I got the pancakes with peanut butter ice cream and a side of sausage. It is never too cold for ice cream. Sausage was dry and disappointing, but eh, can't win them all.

I couldn't leave without having a friend check out the men's washroom and report back. Too funny."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????"}
{"text":"3+
Great selection and atmosphere. Portions are a bit small and prices are a bit high. But the food is very flavorful. I really enjoyed everything here. 

The services was good too and the staff is very helpful in making decisions.

Oh and they have little goals in the urinals which are fun."}
{"text":"A friend and I met up here last week for lunch. It's been getting rave reviews, so we figured we'd try it out for ourselves.

The restaurant itself is quaint, warm and welcoming. When you walk in you are taken aback by the smell of mesquite barbecue and you can choose to sit in the dining room (where you can get a sneak peak of their gigantic wood-burning oven) or the lounge (where you can eat on a sofa). We chose the former.

The service was EXCELLENT. Our waiter was extremely attentive and  he expertly briefed us on all the features of the day.

While this place has some of the most interesting dishes I've ever seen on a menu, it wasn't super vegetarian-friendly. They did have salad, they did have a mushroom pie and lucky for me, their soup of the day was vegetarian. Other than that however, this place is a carnivore's dream come true.

The food was tasty but again, considering the vegetarian selection, one visit was enough for me.

Overall a great experience, but one that others would enjoy far more than I did."}
{"text":"For a pub category of a restaurant, I was quite surprised by its layout AND the food that had to be offered here! Or perhaps maybe I'm just not familiar with the downtown area still and the restaurants that  are around. My friend and I was in the area and didnt have a preference on what kind of food we had. Knowing me, I mostly prefer western food (or 'white' food if you will) if I had a choice. In any case, since I didn't know too many places I let Yelp help me decide where to go. Ok enough of the intro, lets talk about the place and everything else!

The layout and atmosphere are completely NOT what you would expect at a pub-type place. Pubs I usually think that there is a huge bar area with booths as tables for people to eat at if they wanted the 'dining area'. This place just shouted the home-y feel and a warm comfort kind of vibe. On top of that, when you walked in there was a display of tea cups and saucers...c'mon how many pubs would display THAT vs. alcohol or something else. It's definitely a great place and it wasn't as loud as I would have expected either. Awesome!

The food was a bit more on the high 20s but I guess it is because we came during dinner time so that $$ sign kinda fooled me thinking it was going to be between $15-$25 since a lot of places I have been to that had '$$' on the Yelp app was actually between $15-$25. In any case, don't worry. You won't be disappointed! You know how people always say \"Well pub food is pub food\" and it kinda implies that mostly you don't really get quality but just regular stuff. Want a nice twist? Here, they have pretty interesting options on the dinner menu. I had the Corned Beef and Potato Pie with Buttered Cabbage. I wasn't sure what to expect given the fact that I was already thrown off with the layout but I can tell you this, I was surprised and it was quite delicious! I also had one of their Ciders that was on tap and it was also good.

Lastly, their service was ok. Could be just a tad better but I'm not going to complain. They did checks on us frequently but interestingly enough, sometimes their check ups would be just quickly taking a look at our table (seeing if everything was all right I suppose) then walking away. Ocassionally they would walk right up to ask. But overall both waiter and waitress were very polite, friendly, helpful and accomodating. Hence I don't have anything bad to say on that part.

Overall this place was pretty good and I am glad I stumbled upon this pub-like fancy-ish restaurant. I will definitely return to try their other dishes on the menu and drink that Cider again. I forget the name...sorry! I will definitely update the review to add the name!"}
{"text":"If you could invent a British pub, one that sidelines the imitators with a sense of humour and style, and exceeds the real thing with a careful and exquisite menu, what you would get is the Queen and Beaver.  
Funny, charming, fabulous food. Setting is an old house, with high ceilings, antiques and good natural light.

I had rabbit pie and loved it.  Mile-high flaky pastry with layers of potato and tender rabbit. My companion had a similar vegetarian style pie - also excellent - and we shared some chocolate stout pudding/cake confection for dessert.

A couple of ciders and we were set for an afternoon of consulting on the mean streets of Toronto.  The only disappointment is that I have stayed at the Eaton Chelsea hotel many times and had no idea this gem was just out the back door.

PS, loved the art at the front door featuring mountie action figures cavorting around an Emily Carr totem pole."}
{"text":"I've been to the Queen and Beaver a couple of times, once for an early morning soccer game, and another time for lunch. 

From now on, I definitely plan on watching soccer games at the Queen and Beaver. Not only is the food fantastic, but the atmosphere and vibe is really relaxing. I went there for an 8.30 kick off, and had their pancakes with a blueberries. The pancakes were delicious. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough syrup to cover the full stack. The drip was tasty, and forthcoming. 

I've also been there for lunch. I had the hand chopped burger and fries. Both the burger and fries were very good."}
{"text":"Slow service, flat beer, unimpressive. Perhaps it was a time-of-day thing (4pm Friday afternoon), but nothing about the experience made me want to return."}
{"text":"The 5 stars are purely for the sticky toffee pudding dessert. Go here just for that, I promise you, you will not be disappointed! I also had fish and chips for dinner and it was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"One of the better English gastropubs around. Good supper menu selection. The Smoked Chicken Xim Xim Soup is tasty and recommended. Friendly staff there and of course, let's not forget the good beer selection."}
{"text":"I am personally a sucker for anything that smacks of old-ladyism that incorporates alcohol, so this was a win-win for me. The decor is homey and I love that the chairs and plates are mismatched. 

I was there for a mid afternoon lunch, and I didn't plan on having a drink...but then I saw that they had two cask ales available. I love cask ale. The service was incredible and I loved the different seating areas available -- some more casual than others. 

The only mini-complaint I have is the portions are small for the price, but I guess I am used to portions at other pubs. And as people have mentioned, the meals are prepared with really high quality ingredients. 

This is definitely a great pick for a work lunch, or for an after work drink...or a weekend drink...and so on."}
{"text":"Had the potato and leek soup. The color was odd but it tasted good with their house baked bread. Ordered he special lamb shank which had no flavor so I sent it back. The manager was really nice and gave us complimentary deserts. 

The fish and chips is worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and found the portions have been okay, food tasted good, and the staff have been attentative. Had fish and chips and the burger, both the usual pub fare quality. It was quiet both days (lunch time). I'd like to see what the place is like at night.. Interior is nice."}
{"text":"Great little patio spot! The food was delicious. And the service was great. Our waitress was on point!! 

The roast was my favourite on the menue from what I've tried here. Super tender and juicy. 

For those that like drinks, pims cup is great. Has a hint of mint and lemon in it, making it for a effect refreshing patio drink. 

I'll defiantly be coming back here."}
{"text":"Cute little British pub we went to for dinner. Two story pub where the main floor had their dining area and upstairs had a cool bar/lounge. The decor was also pretty neat with photos of the Queen. I had the spiced kale salad which wasn't anything special but still good. apparently this pub is known for their obscure dishes listed on their specials board ....which I did not see until after I already placed my order! I liked the atmosphere and the service was great. Would go back again and order something different!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here on Friday night. Kind of surprised, it wasn't busy at all but maybe it was due to the long weekend. 

The pub looks great. Two nice patios in the front - one at street level and the other on the second floor. They had sections to lounge in with couches or more formal seating for groups of different sizes. The pub appears to be a converted house. Really cool decor & atmosphere.

Service was really good, rather formal actually. Drinks were refilled quickly at our table of 10 and our server kept checking in on us and made great recommendations. 

The beer menu is pretty good with 8 beers on Tap and a rotating cask selection. Two good Quebec beers on tap - Blanche du Chambly and McAuslan Cream Ale (both are excellent patio beers). Bottle selection was also good - a number of selections from Beau's, Wellington, F&M and a few UK options.    

Food was definitely above average for a pub:

For appetizers we shared a few orders of fries, Mushroom and Stilton on toast and aged cheddar and smoked tomatoes on toast. I will go on record and say these are my favourite french fries ever. They are served with a good homemade chutney ketchup. There are 5 different toast apps to choose from - lot's of flavour but harder to share - the toast is only split into 3 pieces.

For my main course, I had the burger. The Queen and Beaver burger made Toronto Life's top 25 burger list recently at #23. It was really good and I can see why it made the list. They use chopped sirloin for the patty and its served on a delicious homemade bun. Almost everyone at the table had the burger (8/10) and everyone enjoyed it. I will try the grilled halibut on my next visit. 

Note - the trip to the washroom is a little more exciting here.... at least for the guys.

I will be back for sure.... and soon I hope.

{"text":"Visiting from Halifax and looking for a great sports bar to watch the AFC Pats Vs Ravens game. We found the Queen and Beaver and went upstairs to the \"football\" aka soccer themed bar. Wow. Okay so they all love soccer but we asked them to put on the AFC Championship game - no problem! James was awesome and made us feel like we were visiting his home. We got comfy on a leather sofa, ordered drinks and delicious fish and chips. The fries were the best I have ever had. My husband ordered the curry. I ate half of his and vice versa. What a great place! Warm atmosphere, very British Pub feeling with exposed brick. Great service and staff except for one girl with blond hair who was about as snotty as you could get - buy she left and everyone else was awesome.  I highly recommend it especially if you are a soccer lover. There is a restaurant downstairs too. Very cozy. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Had the best time there on Sunday. A friend and I were in Toronto for the morning and wanted to grab some lunch before heading home. So I quickly yelped local British pubs to where we were and the Q&B came up. Seemed good, so we went. 

I had the Sunday roast beef, and a mango mimosa! My friend had the fish and chips & tea. Both were to die for. Literally the best roast I've ever had in Canada (I'm British) gorgeous rare beef as I requested, garden veg, big puffy yorkie, and the gravy was Devine! I'd drink the stuff, thick proper beef gravy. Hard to find now a days. 
His fish was cooked to perfection, & the fries we're delish! I had to steal a couple! He got a side of gravy for his meal and was so glad he did because the gravy was so good. 

Some things were a little pricy, but for the quality of food and drink you're getting, well worth it. 

Thank you so much to all the staff, I can't wait to go back with my fiancé!"}
{"text":"This place has a great English vibe and was one of the few places to go in a sea of chain restaurants in Toronto. We had the fish and chips and the mussels and they were both delicious. Despite being busy, our food came at a reasonable time and the ambiance made it worthwhile!"}
{"text":"This is a very solid place. It's a nice experience and solid atmosphere. I sat w a friend by the window at front which was nice and cozy, good for convos. Music they play here is standard top forties selection. Service is relatively fast and friendly. They have decent beer choices for fair-ish prices (on higher end of a good deal). It's situated in what looks like what used to be an old home which is a nice vibe, only thing is conquering the stairs when there narrow and stew after  few is a bit of a challenge. But all in all its a good place for an after work drink or quick bite!"}
{"text":"A very nice spot for a beer or a bite to eat. I've come here numerous times for the very laid back pub on the 2nd floor and the delicious English cask ale. I've tried most of the bar snacks and they are quite nice. (Its very rare to see a scotch Egg on the menu at any pub). 

Last week I came for dinner and wasn't disappointed. My friend and I tried a nice selection of dishes, including the Welsh Rarebit ( think gravy and cheese bread) the potted rabbit and the Sweetbreads. All were delicious, well cooked and with a perfect variety of flavors. 

Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last Sunday meeting a former colleague.  Been here before and really enjoyed it. When we arrived we were told the dining room is full for reservations but we could eat in the lounge upstairs. It probably took over 10 minutes for them to come serve us.  And from there on everything took a long time. It was quite busy and they really only had one waitstaff on and she was doing her best. I'm not sure if the menu upstairs is either different or reduced from the menu downstairs but I remember the menu last time I was there when I ate in the restaurant to be more extensive. It looks like the lounge really is for just hanging out having a drink with friends so lesson learned next time I'll make a reservation in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm finding review so difficult lately; everything borders on a 3 or a 4 star, and making the final decision is a toughie.

I love the atmosphere of the upstairs; the couches are great, the lighting perfect.  The cocktail list is frustrating, with no descriptions of ingredients and names like \"Winter Warmer\" and \"Red Devil\" -- okay, but what's IN it??  Given the lack of information, you'd think our server would want to help us out, but she put forth no effort when asked.  (This was a common theme all evening -- absent-minded, no-effort service)

I ended up with the Winter Warmer, which was a great drink.  My dining companion had the roast beef or corned beef - something beef - sandwich and it looked great, with potato chips.  I really like the overall concept of this place, but it needs to be tweaked a bit."}
{"text":"Really nice place for dinner with friends. We tried pork and duck pie today, and both are great. The environment is tidy and romantic. Next time we will definitely eat at upstairs and try some desert."}
{"text":"Winter is my favourite time to go to the Queen and Beaver. Their menu showcases traditional British pub food with a slant on game meats and beloved things like cheese on toast, Roast Beef and lots of Stilton-- they even make Stilton and fruit ice cream that is absolutely amazing (if you like blue cheese-- if not, you should pick another dessert).

Fish and Chips is a generous portion and has a decent crispy batter, They almost always have a delicious Rabbit dish (something that we North Americans shy from), but it's always juicy and tender. Scotch Eggs are satisfying. Mussels are good, but I have yet to have a bowl of mussels that rocks my world. 

Always a great selection of beers on tap.

Queen and Beaver does have two great patios, but I much prefer cozying up here in the winter with their rib-sticking comfort food and a warm crackling fire.

A great pub when you're in the mood for a proper one, and not in the UK or Ireland."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pub in the city.  I have work nearby so I stop in from time to time either for lunch or dinner.  Consistently delicious food and great service.  I love the building, too - the converted home fits perfectly with the food.  

This is my go-to place that I suggest whenever I get asked for recommendations."}
{"text":"Dinner was recommended by the barkeep: a delicious half glass of the local Junction Stout and the Mushroom Pithivier. It's like a pot pie with a cheese top, mushrooms, then many thin layers of potatoes with a few tiny gherkins and a light spring mix side salad. Overall the main was quite tasty but not stunning enough to immediately drag the veg-pot-pie lovers in my life back here to try one. (Particularly at its $22 price point! Somehow missed that the menu.) Perhaps if it had a different cheese or a bit of rosemary or such, this visit would call for a repeat, as it's a sweet pub with great staff, an excellent selection of local crafts beers, and good music at a decent volume (downstairs anyway), even on a Friday night. Came in starved and was still hungry post-Pithivier but not feeling like a big sticky sugar-bomb so I got the oat cakes and Red Lester cheddar -- and man, it was a great choice. I probably wouldn't have ordered that on a normal day but that's actually the surprise win of the night. The dish I would come back for."}
{"text":"A better British pub than most pubs in Britain. Seriously: everyone is so polite, the food is fantastic, the place is nicely decorated and it's spotlessly clean. 

Like a pub you'd bring the Queen to. Or, say, your mother."}
{"text":"Well, the '4 star' review seems to be the consensus. Decent place, but it's on the 'uptown' side of the scale, as far as English Pubs are concerned. It's not quite the sort of place to go with your mates after 2 too many pints at the comedy club, or a Bluejays game. It's more of a place to have a nice date with an English flavor. 

It's more suited to a relaxed happy hour or a decent date location, than a place to catch an FIM match. 

The food is well prepared, but the menu is a bit limited, compared to most English pubs. Maybe to consolidate the selections down to a few of their top dishes. The beer selection is fine, with the expected stouts and lagers represented. Prices are right in line with the area."}
{"text":"This is such a gem in the heart of downtown. The Queen and Beaver is a genuine replica of a proper classic British pub, not a watered-down franchised attempt at it.
So believe me when I say that this isn't your typical bar with cheap booze and bad food.
Located on Elm St. (a side street just north east of Bay and Dundas), this pub offer small cozy rooms, a front patio and an upper level patio.

This is high end food so it will cost you a bit - but it will be worth it.

I think the management made a very good choice in breaking down the menu based on the time of the day you visit.
The menu changes throughout the day: you will have a brunch, hors d'oeuvres, lunch and supper menu. 
Also, I really love the idea that each menu, has few options you can choose from that will help you to select what you want to eat within minutes.

Wherever there's a short menu I have noticed in all my experiences eating out, that the food is not only fresher, but it's also faster for the chef to cook and to be served (depending how busy a place is) and allows the restaurant to changes some of the items throughout the seasons making each of your visit more interesting because you can expect to find different dishes from time to time

Some of the items though, are a classic and they always be in the menu because it would be almost a crime if you won't have being a pub. I'm talking about dishes like fish and chips or Shepherd's pie. Well my friends, for the old fav pub fare, these items will never change and will be always there.

My last visit here, we had their fish and chips, grilled feather steak & tewkesbury mustard, 2 lbs of PEI Mussels steamed in wheat beer, fennel & cream and scotch eggs. 
All the food came at the same time, within 20 mins from ordering. It was well cooked and of good portions.

The drinks? Well, the selection is very good even thought I would like to see more of a 50/50 distribution of choices: a bit more classic English/Scottish beer (like Fuller's, Spitfire, Courage best bitter, Belhaven, or even McEwan's). While the local selection is very good, I think I would remove from the menu the following beers not because they are not good (actually they are), but because they are not local or British (the Queen and Beaver is a British pub in Toronto!):
- McAuslan Brewery (Montreal, Quebec)
- Sierra Navada, California, USA

In each visit, I found the service to be very good: people working here are very nice, attentive and make you feel comfortable. You can even crack a joke and they will \"follow\" you. 

Like I said in the opening of the review, The Queen and Beaver is cozy, beautiful pub centrally located that offers an authentic great English pub fare along with a great selection of drinks handled by a capable staff. This is a great spot for a few drinks when you want an intimate atmosphere; or one of those place where you can come for a drink alone with a book, with an old friend for a good chat or even with a group of people. 

Definitely a place to go. 
See you soon QnB :)"}
{"text":"Go for the food and drink, and stay for the vibe. 

Just steps away from the tourist trap of Yonge and Dundas, The Queen and Beaver is a very welcome oasis in the downtown core's mega chain monopoly. 

With patios out front, and upstairs, there is a nook and cranny spot for any occasion. The interior of the house reminds me of my Great Great Aunt's historic home. High ceilings, grand staircase, large antique furniture, and vintage plates. This place is homey, clean, comfortable, and cool. The Q&B is a great spot if you want to catch up with friends (like I did today), grab some great Brit food, and perhaps catch a footie game. 

For the food, I have tried: 
- the burger. This is not your ordinary burger. It is chopped meat, so you can have it medium rare. It is very rich, and if you are not a fan of having some good ole fat in your burger - stay away 
- the fries. These are truly heavenly. Proper large Brit style chips. Dip them in the home made Q&B curry ketchup. Perfect combo. 
- the lamb curry. Very tender (and not too rich) lamb. This meat is cooked long and slow. Ordering lamb in a restaurant is always a gamble. This meat was very tender and not greasy at all. The curry sauce was okay - again, very typical Brit style - not Indian style. The rice was a bit undercooked for my liking. 
- the pork chop with pea gnocchi. The pea gnocchi is absolutely amazing. This was truly mind blowing - highly recommend. 
- the mojito I had was amazing. I took a sip, and my friends asked me how it was. I literally sat with my eyes closed. So good that I needed a minute. 

For desserts, they have a variety available - go for the walnut tart. Excellent for sharing. 

All in all, this place is just amazing, and is always enjoyable. On Sunday's you (along with at least 5 other guests) can prebook to enjoy roast beef with Yorkshire pudding. This is next on my list of things to try at the Q&B. 

Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this review.

Honestly, the food is always really good and it isn't very expensive. 
However, I have heard and experienced nothing but terrible service here. It is as if the staff doesn't care about the customer at all.  I don't think I'm alone in that opinion.
Maybe try getting your food to go?"}
{"text":"They've been around for a while now and for good reason. What a nice and relaxing multipurpose spot. 

I work near here and my SO has a place nearby and so it's a convenient place to pub it up. It can make for cozy winter drinks; patio brunches; after work pints (or half pints!); a Sunday roast; game watching; a burger fix; and so on...

I've been a fan of their other spot, the Oxley for a while too, but still haven't tried the Wickson Social at St. Joseph and Yonge."}
{"text":"What a great british pub! My husband and I trekked in very late on a Friday night in search of a few pints and a bite to eat. You immediately feel like you've stepped back in time to someone's old victorian home. The atmosphere is cozy and warm (literally) with a dining area downstairs, a bar as well as another bar and bar seating upstairs. 

The serving ware is comprised of old pieces of random ill-matching china which adds character. We enjoyed a scotch egg and a fall salad special for appetizers. I ordered the roast beef sandwich with horseradish and an amazing chutney for my main. It came with addictive, salty homemade crisps too - ummmmmm, dangerous! My husband chowed down on shepherd's pie. If memory serves correct, it was very tasty, but a bit of a unique flavor made with rosemary. 

Only negative was the waitress who was pretty grumpy and seemed pissed off to be working, but all-in-all a good pub find!"}
{"text":"I went here for an early dinner/food.  My meal was just okay, and it was overpriced. I also burned the inside of my mouth quite badly - I believe the temperature of the chop was not completely even resulting in the accident.  Service and atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Not disappointed at all with this restaurant it was good. Look forward too getting back. The service was very good as well."}
{"text":"Came back for dinner with a friend. The patio was nice and I've always been impressed by their large selection of beers. The salmon was decent. However, the service was definitely subpar. Maybe it was just a bad day, but the server only checked up on us once in the 1.5-2hrs we were there. Did not fill our water even though we asked once beforehand. As well, one detail that I remember was how the server briskly snatched the menu out of my hand after I ordered drinks (perhaps she assumed I did not want to get food).
Might come back again, but will try to stick to drinks and anything that requires minimal service."}
{"text":"Just wonderful!
Great atmosphere, the smell of the fire is divine. Awesome roast beef and pudding! Elizabeth the manager is lovely"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Very high quality food.  Classy, mature vibe but not at all stuffy.  And best of all- a great staff.  I returned to the Queen and Beaver after a six month absence (I live in New York) and the staff remembered me by name.

I'm guaranteed to return every time I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Waited 75 minutes for fish & chips.  When they still hadn't arrived, I tried to settle up for the beer and appetizer.  Instead of apologizing for the slow service, they left me waiting at the til and went back in the kitchen to see if they could stuff some fish in a box and get me to pay for it.  They said it would be ready in just a minute, and I said, \"I'm leaving right now.  If you really think it's in your best interest to charge me for food you've taken more than 75 minutes to deliver go ahead.  Without a moment of consideration, they rang it through and charged me for a meal they never even delivered.  What a complete asshole."}
{"text":"Perhaps it may be due to the fact I do not follow Futbol or sports in general, nor that am I British, hence I do not understand the charm so many of my British friends find in this pub. 

During the weekends, after-work hours, or during a Futbol match, do not be surprised if you find this place utterly packed! Last time my friends wanted to come here, we literally dropped by, were given a pager so we could be informed of when our table would be ready, walked over to a Japanese restaurant, *ATE A FULL DINNER*, and THEN came back for, uh, a lighter dinner and drinks. 

Yes, it is a nicer, more upscale looking venue and has a tad more gravitas than the usual Firkin's joint but that is negated by the fact this place is overpriced for what you ultimately get, which, if I may be so bold to say, is nothing more than comely looking pub fare.  

I do appreciate the location, and I did so even more about a decade ago when there was less competition in the area, but these days? The Q&B has been losing ground to the crowded number of options you can now find within a 5-minute walk radius.  

Surely, there are some who will love this locale until the day it closes, since as I said, it is not inherently bad, not by a long shot, it is just not as good as it used to be when compared to what you can find near Yonge and Dundas.

About the best thing I can say is that if you ever *needed* to take out-of-towners or a date to a pub (really? why?), that you could easily do much worse than bringing them here. If that is the case, then I would suggest the second floor, as the fireplace does add to the ambiance and idea that you are not at what is essential a well-dressed pub."}
{"text":"What?? Why have I not reviewed this place???
This has been probably an infrequent but regular choice for me when I want to chill in a place that kind of feels like a house.
I don't know what it is about this place but it attracts awesome people of all sorts.

I have some really fond memories here and that is why it deserves 4 stars.  Had I not shared some good company here it would have got 3 stars which is still, literally, \"a-ok\"

The highlights of this place include:
Quality food.
A sunday pig roast dinner- seriously.. you have to reserve...but now you know it is an option.
Cask ale- This is the FIRST place in toronto where I tried Cask.  Now, they only have one tap, and while it rotates I find that it doesn't really.  It is always a crisp light type Cask which is ok, but not my style.  Regardless, this is where I fell in love with Cask and it inspired me to check out the handful of pubs in Toronto that offered Cask.
It's on elm street.  Now, this is kind of a ridiculously charming street in the middle of a not-so-charming neighbourhood.  Kind of smack dab in a tacky downtown consumerist area, this street is super quaint and makes you smile.

Low lights:
It's a little spendy for what it is.  You are definitely flipping the bill for the real estate rather than the food/drinks/service. 
Regardless, this is a fine choice if in the area.

Yes to:
Patio, 
Upperfloor deck/patio
Couches
TV with constant coverage of futbol,

{"text":"I came here to start my pub crawl and had a couple drinks. The downstairs area is more reserved for dinning than anything else - the bar is small only seats 5. But if you go upstairs you'll find yourself in a more lounge, pub style bar with TVs and much better seating. 

They have some local beers on tap and always have a rotating cask. I was pretty happy with their craft beer selection, even if it was a bit limited. But overall, its nice little pub - nothing more or less. 

Note: Man U fans come here on game days, which may or may not be your thing."}
{"text":"Excellent pub in a beautiful old home that has been restored with thoughtful mementos and charming decoration that looks haphazardly placed, which is comfortable and cozy.  This is a great place for pub food especially meat themed foods.  The specials are great and flavourful.  I had the short ribs and it was melt in your mouth tasty.  My new goal will be to try every single thing in this place.  I cannot wait for the weather to get warmer so that I could get into the patio."}
{"text":"I ended up here twice in one week, and that is saying something.

First - ladies meet up after work. Ordered some appz while waiting for the rest of the girls. 2 of us had a cough, and hot toddy (not on menu)was made. 

Very quaint small patio outside, 2 floors, patio on the second floor as well. Well decorated, old English style pub. like, REAL English style. Very prim proper yet welcoming.

I had the salmon. The salmon comes cold, with an amazingly balanced potato salad. I had this on both occasions as it was that great.

Service was great. desserts are a thumbs down, I left there feeling diabetic at the sticky toffee pudding. I know, I know, it is supposed to be sweet. But this was overwhelming in a negative way.

I will come back here. It is a block away from work. Great places surround it. Go here for a drink on the patio when the weather is appropriate."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have breakfast on a Sunday.  We were walking down Elm Street and came across this restaurant.  We decide to take a chance.  We ordered the English Breakfast and Quiche.  Both of the breakfast were fantastic.  Even the coffee was pretty good.  We were definitely happy we found this place."}
{"text":"Amazing burger, English chips to die for.  Great service for a Monday Afternoon lunch.
Heard about the legendary burgers here and decided to give it a try. 
Server was excellent, she gave me a sample of the cider on tap to see what I thought.  Turns out it wasn't to my liking, so glad she did before I ordered up a 20 ouncer.

We had the burger & fries, mine with Stilton, my date had swiss.  
Turns out the burger is actually a chopped sirloin steak, a different taste/texture experience from most local burger shops.  Great thick bacon on it, I'm normally not a cheese & bacon guy, but this stuff was high-end.  
Sauce on the side was tomato, curry based...very good, but be warned if you're not a curry fan, skip this.   

Fries...probably the best I've ever had.  Spot-on English-style.

Cool place, literally.  It was 25 below today, we sat in the front near the window, there was a cold draft, so on cold days avoid the front room."}
{"text":"B and I had lunch at The Queen and Beaver Public House.  We came here for their winterlicious lunch menu (yes, this is a late post).  I had picked a number of contenders for our lunch but since this one was closest to her workplace and B hadn't had British food before, this one won the lot.

I called the restaurant to make a reservation for a 1 p.m. lunch the day before.  I arrived at 12:50 p.m. and the gentleman at the front warmly greeted me and led me to my table that was in the front area of the restaurant.  It was a gorgeous dining room with curtains and brick-exposed walls and wooden furniture.  Our table was a marble top.  The entire space felt so warm and \"British\".  I really liked the space.

It took B a bit of time to arrive since she couldn't find parking.  While waiting, the server served me the menus and my water.  She was very pleasant and warm throughout the visit.  After B arrived, we were very quickly able to determine what we wanted to order from the winterlicious lunch menu.

Our appetizers arrived very quickly.  We both chose the Smoked White Fish & Salmon Rillettes that came with sourdough crisps.  I hadn't had rillettes before which is kind of like a fish pâté -- I've only had meat pâté up to this point.  The smoked white fish and salmon rillettes were mashed together and looked like a dip or spread.  There was a pickled onion and cucumber salad accompanying the dish too.  The plate was really pretty.

I thought this appetizer was okay.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to eat this by piling the rillettes and salad onto the sourdough crisps like a topping but I alternated how I ate it by eating it separately and together.  I liked the rillettes and could taste a bit of the two fishes in it.  The sourdough crisps were very, very crispy and hard.

As it happened, B and I also chose the same entrées (I liked that their Winterlicious lunch menu had a choice of four options).  We chose the Steak, Ale, and Mushroom Cobbler with cheddar and herb scones.  It arrived in a nice presentation.  There was a grouping of steamed herbed carrots to the side which I really enjoyed.  I liked how the carrots were steamed firm yet tender.

The cheddar and herb scone was actually smaller than I thought.  I thought it would have covered the width of the bowl.  It was so small that it sunk into the broth/gravy and looked like a biscuit instead.  I was surprised that this dish wasn't served with mashed potatoes or roasted potatoes because the generous amount of gravy in the dish would have called for something carby to eat with -- at least that's what I would have preferred since I like dense good-tasting gravy such as this one.  I couldn't really discern the ale in the dish, but the steak and mushrooms were there.  At first I thought the steak bites were going to be actual steak pieces but they were more of the cheaper variety of just beef chunks.  I don't think I can call beef chunks as 'steak'.  Another reason why I would have preferred some mashed potatoes or potatoes to go with this dish because the gravy was quite salty at times.  A little carbs would have masked and/or neutralized the saltiness.

I notice that they serve the Cobbler also in their Winterlicious dinner menu.  For lunch, this was a good portion but if I got this portion for dinner, I'm not sure if it would have been enough -- this is on the assumption that dinner portions should be larger than lunch ones.

For the dessert component, we chose the Almond Chocolate Cake and the Sticky Toffee Pudding to share.

The Sticky Toffee Pudding with vanilla ice cream looked nice with contrasting dark and light colours.  The sticky toffee pudding at first bite was really sweet (probably magnified after the salty cobbler) and the vanilla ice cream was even sweeter than I almost choked on the sugar content.  However, after a few bites it didn't taste as sweet anymore.  The sticky toffee pudding was okay.

The Almond Chocolate Cake with orange crème fraîche appeared like a flourless chocolate cake because of how dense the cake looked.  However, this wasn't confirmed since we neither asked the server nor did it say on the menu that it was flourless or not.  The chocolate cake was dense and not too sweet (maybe because we had had the sticky toffee pudding first).  There were almond flakes in the orange crème fraîche.  I liked the orange crème fraîche because I could taste the tarty orange flavour.  It helped to break up the sweetness from the cake.

All in all, I thought that the food at The Queen and Beaver Public House was good but not outstanding.  It was better than average especially in terms of how they presented their food.  I liked their plates!  I also really appreciated the warm and friendly service that the staff showed towards the customers.  It was definitely a bonus."}
{"text":"The Queen and Beaver has proved itself to be one of my most treasured finds via Yelp. It is on top of my list for a watering hole when a regular bar just won't do the trick. I have yet to dine here but their bar menu while pricy has some British items and the food I've had have always been good.

The best seats here (upstairs) are definitely the couch set right in front of the television where football matches look spectacular in. The problem is, most of the other seats are not very well placed and it is a little cramped up, but it's never been a factor to turn me away from it. 

The last time I was set to come here, my friend (fellow Yelper Susan G) called them for reservations and they said that we wouldn't need reservations ( after telling them it would be for a large group) as they would not be easy. So of course when we got there, not a single empty seat was to be seen. Needless to say, we were not impressed.

They also don't have a great beer selection but the few options available are all better than average. Service is friendly and relatively quick too. Very pretty interior decor as well always something to catch your mind including a great looking fake fooseball table. 

I highly recommend this location to anyone looking for a good time at a fun place."}
{"text":"I love this place. I was recently in Toronto for the second time and couldn't wait to come back to the upstairs bar. The atmosphere is so comfortable and very relaxing which I enjoy compared to the rest of downtown. It's a British-style pub and that's very obvious with the decor, menu, and even the staff. The bartenders are extremely friendly and happy to have a conversation and to answer any question you might have about the menu. 

This time around, I enjoyed a Pimms Cup (very refreshing) and a lager (also refreshing). I asked the bartender what would be the better choice between the Fish and Chips and the Shepard's pie and he told me the Fish and Chips were the best you could have outside of England. I wasn't going to say no to that. He was absolutely right. Would highly recommend this dish if you're considering. 

We came back a second time to the upstairs lounge and decided to try the Hamburgers (they don't serve the full menu upstairs until after 5 I believe). While I enjoyed the Fish and Chips more, this was also an excellent choice. The fries were delicious too. 

I can't say enough about this place and if you find yourself on this side of downtown, I'd highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable. lovely atmosphere perfect for bunch. I ordered the benedict and it was delicious the extra green on top was a small detail that did a good difference with the taste"}
{"text":"It's a really nice place, but the service provided by the waitress was awfully bad.  She was trying to get rid of us with such a bad attitude. We ended up leaving earlier than what we expected, moreover, we felt forced to do so.

On the other hand, the bloke at the bar was friendly and quite efficient. Not sure if I would come back to this place though."}
{"text":"Patio is awesome but too small and crowded. Can hear other's conversation. Burgers are not bad"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, small menu which means everything is really good and we were not disappointed. The service from our server/bartender was an absolute plus. The kale salad and mussels are a must. 
Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I went there once for a friend's birthday and the atmosphere was pleasant enough so I decided to return. I made a reservation and unfortunately had to cancel a few days before the event. When I called to cancel, the guy was extremely sarcastic, condescending, and all around rude. I won't be returning and suggest you hire staff with basic manners."}
{"text":"Was here only for a brief time to grab a snack and drink before seeing a movie, but I really liked it and would totally come back. 

There's not much choice in unique foods and interesting restaurants in the area - this cozy house on quiet Elm street, away from the bustle of the core, is a great place to chill, grab a drink and eat some interesting foods. 

They don't have a patio, but they have a rooftop terrace. 

Inside, was like someone's house, cozy with plush chairs and a big screen upstairs where I was told is the main hangout to watch the football (english style) game. 

They have Cider on Tap, which is rare and the Thornbury was amazing. So smooth and fresh. 

I loved everything on the menu about $20-25, with gastro type food, and meat. 

I'm definitely would come here again if in the area."}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to write a review for this place...I have eaten here countless times and love it...British bias, maybe. 

Queen AND Beaver, I have to remind a dear friend of mine it is not called the Queen's Beaver...what an unfortunate name that would be! 

The decor: well it's British themed and beautifully done...home from home for me! I love the smell of this place, reminds me of my grans kitchen.

Head to the bar upstairs for football, generally they show English Premier League.

I love that tea and food are served in/on china cups/plates, that are mismatched. Again it reminds me of going to my grans house for dinner. 

I have had brunch, lunch and dinner here. Full english was really tasty and hangover cure tastic. The burger is super tasty and cooked to however you like it, for me it has to be rare! I have also been for Sunday dinner twice and both times as we had a large group we ordered from the feasting menu. I have had the roast beef and beef wellington from the feasting menu. The wellington is out of this world, expensive but you will not be sorry. Sunday dinner comes with yorkshire puddings...the only others to rival my mothers...that is saying something as trust me when I say that woman can cook, goose fat roast potatoes (you can feel the inches adding to your hips), selection of vegetables and gravy (in a gravy boat). Grab a group of friends, order from the feasting menu and enjoy Snday roast dinner!

Note: if you are ordering the feasting menu you need to pre-order before the Thursday of the week you are eating there and secure the reservation with a credit card. 

For Sunday dinner (feasting or not) reservations are a must as it is super busy.

As for desserts...Oh Lordy. The last time I went 4 of us ordered a different dessert each and shared, I remember we had a hazelnut/chocolate meringue, sticky toffee pudding, lemon sponge and the other I cannot recall. I have also had the chocolate orange tart. All I can say is epic! The homemade ice creams...ugh I need to stop as I fear I am about to drown in my own saliva. 

So this place is not the cheapest but everything is homemade, even the ketchup for the chips (or fries). 

I have taken most of my friends here and everyone loves it. 

Would I go back: nothing would keep me away!"}
{"text":"Solid British-style pub with two levels - a more formal dining room on the first floor and far more casual, London-like pub on the second. 

Like true British pubs, this place isn't solely about the booze - although it does have a good selection of local craft brews. It also has a good offering of solid food that rotates from time to time. For me, a Scotch egg was exactly like I'd had in London, while an entrée of crusted salmon was filling and satisfying.

Service at the bar was fairly helpful too, and the overall atmosphere and accessibility of the second floor compared to the ground floor was like day and night. Overall, a charming venue amid Toronto's downtown core that's a throwback to bygone times."}
{"text":"Nice looking place. Pretty good vibe. They don't have a good selection of reasonable wines, so that got costly. Ordered the burger,which was tasty enough but the bun was dried out.

Overall I likely won't go back. A bit too expensive, and they  didn't deliver enough. I don't mind paying when I go out, but I would like to feel I got my money's worth."}
{"text":"We try to find unique local food experiences whenever we can.  And the Q&B did it. An authentic pub with good food. Had the corned beef and potato pie first night. Came back for the roast beef on Sunday  both excellent. Washed down with a pint of Bitter   And a Very attentive staff.   In all two great dining experiences"}
{"text":"Arrivé à Toronto pour un expo professionnel, j'ai la soirée libre devant moi. Malheureusement la météo a décidée de me rendre la vie dure et il pleut (quand je suis parti de Montréal ce matin il y avait un si beau soleil).

La ville ne m'impressionne pas particulièrement , peut être à cause de la brume et du brouillard.. Je sais pas. J'ai pas envie de marcher et le goût de la découverte que en générale me pousse à droite et à gauche, la il se tait.

Du coup, affamé, je me retrouver par pur hasard devant the queen and the beaver. Le nom me fait rigoler (je pense , oui je sais, c'est complètement débiles , au film Zombievers..) et du coup je rentre.
Le serveur m'invite à monter à l'étage (en bas la salle est sur réservation ) et la je me trouve dans un espèce de salon, comme dans une maison de campagne anglaise. Mur en brique, atmosphère un peu sombre, des canapés en cuire, des meubles en bois foncé, une petite bibliothèque . C'est beau, ça me plait. Je me réconforte dans mon choix.

Je commande une bière stout, et je me décide pour le plat du jour : sunday roastbeef avec yorkshire pudding, asperges, carottes et haricots verts. 
TELLEMENT BON ! Ahhhhh ! J'en ai encore l'eau à la bouche !!!
Pour finir je me suis laissé tenter par un sticky toffee... La cerise sur le gâteau !

Du service au repas, tout a été parfait !


Ps : pour tout dire des deux serveurs l'un a été top, l'autre avait ma tête un peu ailleurs et a essayé deux fois de me donner des commandes d'autres tables.."}

{"text":"4.5
the food was presented beautifully and delicious.  all of my tables food was tasty and high end.  the beer was awesome and the atmosphere was fabulous.  no one this place is top of the line in terms of toronoto gastropubs.  loud environment but not obnoxious.  the place seems mature elegant, it has a special english tea vibe situated in a old house vibe.  the only thing would  be wait timesto get a seat especially on a friday night.  over an hour wait."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night so some of our group could enjoy the roast beef.  From the moment I made the phone reservation, I sensed this was going to be a good experience.  Sat in the window of the restaurant downstairs.  Our server was attentive without being overbearing.  She answered questions and made suggestions.
Now to the food.  The roast beef dinner was huge, full of flavour and delicious gravy.  The Yorkshire pudding was perfect, not soggy although it came with gravy on top.  Roast potatoes, fresh asparagus made for a perfect Sunday dinner.  I don't eat beef, so I chose the veggie pie.  The pie was roasted mushrooms and potatoes which were sliced in layers.  The crust was flaky and light.  Absolutely delicious I enjoyed every bite.  Portions were just right.  We enjoyed a variety of deserts, cheese and oat cakes, chocolate nemesis cake and treacle tart.  All very good.  The beer was also tasty.  Can't wait to come back and enjoy another meal or drink at the Queen and Beaver."}
{"text":"Sloooow service ....waited at least 15 minutes for waitress to even come by our table (this was brunch btw). I was sooo thirsty!! not a drop of water anywhere lol....ok lets get straight to the food

coffee - meh...lukewarm 
English breakfast - meh..nothing to write home about, 2 of my friends thought the sausage was too salty and beans bland..the best english breakfast i've ever had (not that i've had \"that\" many) was at Au Cheval in chicago surprisingly
Baked Egg with cheese and spinach  - meh meh
Kedegree - i think this was the best dish however it was my first time trying this indian breakfast specialty and it was good but was it spectacular?? i felt like i was having a decent fried rice for breakfast with some curry spice...sorry i guess i'm not the best judge of Kedegree but i did finish the entire plate bc i love me some fried rice"}
{"text":"The cask beers are incredible, and you cannot go wrong with any dish on their menu. The atmosphere is spot-on, and the interior gets the old British pub vibe just right. Anything cooked in their wood-fired oven is absolutely outstanding. This is arguably Toronto's best gastropub."}
{"text":"I had friends visiting from overseas who were staying in the area so at random we picked this place for dinner. It was a little more upscale than we were expecting with the cheaper mains being around $18. This isn't the pub where you get nachos and mozza sticks. I got the chopped burger with stilton. It was served with fries and some chutney-like tomato cumin thing. The bun was stale and not at all appealing. The burger itself was cooked medium and quite flavorful. It was topped with bacon and cheese of your choice, I chose stilton which was the perfect match. Sadly half way through I had to resort to dumping ketchup on it to deal with the nasty bun. The fries were perfection. They were real potatoes, not frozen crap. Great crisp and nicely salted. The place was really busy. When we walked in at 6 they said they could seat us but we had to be out by 8:30. We figured that was ok. The food took ages to be delivered, though, so we ended up pretty close to our deadline. Our server was effective. She didn't go out of her way to be great, but I can't complain about anything she did. The burger should have been more in the $12 range so I doubt I'll go back, but this place is ok."}
{"text":"This place is a true gem.  Great atmosphere, great service, great cask ales, and stellar food.  Food is an absolutely refined and upscale version of our favorite 'pub' food.  The squash and dumplings is probably my favorite thing to eat - a must try!  I go here as often as I can :)"}
{"text":"I have been only once and don't plan on returning.  I have never been served by such sad and uninterested faces!  The servers are extremely unfriendly.  

We had 4 appetizers when we were there:  the crispy rabbit was overcooked and dry, the wood roast quail and shoestring fries (mostly shoestring fries) was also very dry.  The fries were very good as were the grilled sardines on toast.

So many great places to eat in Toronto, I can't understand why anyone would spend their money here.  It's not inexpensive for the level of quality of the food."}
{"text":"Excellent service with elegant pub food. If I didn't live far away from this place I'd be going more often. We have been there 5 times, and the service and food has been consistently good. Portions are not huge, but taste and attention to detail of taste and presentation are tops for pub style food. Main dining room is great- get a seat in the front room if possible though- some of the bench seating along the sides are not very comfortable.  Its our special occasion pub destination!"}
{"text":"Had the chopped burger and the sticky toffee pudding. Didn't care for either. The chopped burger lacked flavour and the texture was odd. The sticky toffee was not at all what I expected. Heavy on the molasses, which was overpowering. The food was overpriced for what you got.

The atmosphere was nice, and so were the wait staff. They helped us to understand the terms on the menu. Their menu is not for the lactose-intolerant."}
{"text":"Awesome people work here! Food was awesome. Had the terrine and no one warned me about the tomatoes that came with it. Impeccable! Drinks were also tasty. Had a wonderful experience here. The scotch egg was my first, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I enjoyed that also."}
{"text":"Great drinks (the blue-eyed ginger was uniquely delicious), a homey setting (with comfy chairs and a bookcase) and friendly service make for a great hang out spot.  And while I did not sample any, the food looked delicious.

I appreciated the fact the bar was a little off the main drag.  There was plenty of seating when I went (weekday night) both inside and outside.

As for the name - well at least its easy to remember!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a beer to check it out. Me: a bottle of heineken please Mr Cool: we don't carry anything mass produced. Ok jerk off then why do you have creemore grey goose Czechvar ... The list goes on. I want a beer not a lesson. Just say no don't treat me like a moron bc u don't have the best selling beer in the world."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of pubs or bars or basically any place in which there are many beers on tap. I don't like them so much that I didn't even know \"pub\" was short for \"public\"! I still can't believe it!

But when I entered this establishment, I ate my words. They may not have the fancy cocktails that I have become accustomed to and they may have a million different beers on tap but this place felt like home. I walked in and felt like I was having a dinner party at a friend's house. 

It has a lived in feeling with wooden tables and old chairs with cushions that I would lay a cozy over first before seating but the interesting part is that there are tables in which every seat is a lounge couch! I love that. And then you walk up the padded rug staircase and I felt like I needed to take my shoes off to walk on it. Upstairs is the coolest part where it's a small room with a large screen that specifically shows off Premiere League soccer games. In the afternoon this room will be filled with old English blokes watching a bit of footie. Walking through the upstairs room takes you to the rooftop patio, there is also a separate patio downstairs street level. 

Bathrooms are decent but the paper towels they have to wipe your hands with are so thick and soft that I took a few home to use to wash my face with.

All the food is very English oriented with lots of pies and a sticky toffee pudding that was phenomenal. There are different specials daily and they tend to run out of stuff and change things up on the menu depending on what they had fresh for the day. 

So I guess what I'm saying is that I wouldn't mind coming to this PUBLIC house once in a while and that's saying a lot coming from me."}
{"text":"Nice place to go to after work or during a get together. Drinks were really strong lol. The service could have been a bit better - it took a while for us to have our orders taken."}
{"text":"Items ordered: 

- Hand chopped burger
- Duck

Food wasn't bad, but also not anything spectacular. Burger was a little on the small side. Fries were on the soggier side. Duck was cooked well, but didn't leave a lasting impression. For the price, I was expecting much better food. For the money spent, I would have been better off grabbing a Five Guys burger with money leftover to spend on a I Love BJ's shirt. (BJ = BlueJays. Git yer mind outta the gutter.) 

Only upside is the upstairs terrace. Nice place to grab a drink and relax."}
{"text":"Upscale pub fare. Love the vibe- lots of brick, lots of wood, very homey and great for winter. ALso have a nice rooftop patio which is quiet and nice to grab a drink on a summer day. Menu is interesting and probably not for the unadventurous."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night expecting greasy but elevated pub food and we got exactly what we had hoped for, albeit a bit less greasy and a bit more elevated. 

I ordered their fish and chips and despite not being a huge fan of this iconic British dish, i LOVED it. The large filet of white fish was fried to a perfect flakiness. My favourite part was by far the batter: the lightness of the batter just made me crave for more batter on the fish, which is unheard of. It was just that good! The large piece of fish came with a side of chips, lightly seasoned with salt as well as a homemade ketchup and a homemade tartare sauce (once again, amazing and not heavy at all).

Prices for cocktails are slightly above average, ranging between $10 and $15, beers as well. Overall, a great cozy atmosphere perfect for a fun but elevated pub night."}
{"text":"Pithivier is fantastic
Mussels bland, but love the house ketchup with cumin.  
Extremely cosy atmosphere
Decent selection of whiskey and gin
Menu is fun enough to want more"}
{"text":"Stars for the environment and fresh ingredients. Taste is over salty to me. And I don't enjoy British food that much."}
{"text":"Civilized pub! For the generally raucous downtown core, this. Place is a gem 
Great grub. I had fish and chips which were lightly battered and flaky.  Chips were very tasty  

You pay a premium due to real estate , but
Good value. 

Nice beers on tap. Try the London 
Pride.

Coming back. Nuff said."}
{"text":"We came to this pub on Saturday at around 2 o'clock for some lunch. The menu outside showed quite a selection. So we paid for parking ($3.50 an hour if you park right outside the pub) and went on the second floor patio that overlooks Elm St. Everything looked very promising. Then the waitress brought us menus which differed a lot from the one we saw outside - turned out it was a brunch menu. It only had about 12 items on it half of which were very clearly breakfast foods like eggs which I wasn't really in the mood for at 2pm. The last item was a roast of some sort but the waitress informed us that the roast is only served after 5 and so it's on the brunch menu as an advertisement of sorts. All in all we were left with 5 choices - very staple things like fish&chips and bangers&mash. 
The real kicker was the beer though. They only have 5 beers on tap, but when we were there 3 of those 5 were out! They only had Fuller's and some Canadian beer. That's a pub??? 2 beers?? Even if they had all of them, 5 beers???
Maybe it's better for dinner, but I don't think I will try"}
{"text":"One of my local favorites for a quick pint, brunch or even dinner. Love the cozy atmosphere and the beverage selection. 

The brunch is definitely on the richer side with smaller portions. I don't think I could eat more than what they have though. I live for summer nights on the patio."}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is amazing. No, it's not cheap. But really, if you want to eat cheaply and don't care if the food is amazing, then cook something for yourself. Amiright?

Went for dinner on Saturday night. Our early evening plans didn't pan out so well, so we decided to see if they had a table for us at around 9pm. Primetime, and the place was busy, but they had a table for us. LUCKY us because the food is great! 

I want to go back and try the rest of the menu (slowly, over time, not all at once). What I did try was delicious. From the Alberta cider and the freshly baked bread at the beginning, I knew we were in for something special. We had the potted goose and cumberland jelly to start. It was delicious and very rich and filling. YUM. I had a really difficult time deciding on a main, but I feel like at this place you just can't go wrong. I opted for the pheasant and white sausage with date whiskey sauce (because I'm not going to get that at home!) and it was great. Really flavourful and perfectly cooked. The hubby had mussels and fries, and those fries were really good too. I had more than my share.

Unfortunately, we didn't have enough room in our stomachs to try anything else. I will have to rectify that soon with a return visit. Yum."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with a good beer selection and amazing food. There is nothing better than a hearty meal and beer here during a cold February evening."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch
Venue: The Queen and Beaver
Specialty: Pub fare
Location: 35 Elm Street, Toronto, Ontario
Menu Items: Hand Chopped Burger, Chips and Fish Chips & Beau's All Natural Lug Tread

Most recently, I came across The Queen and Beaver Public House, a Toronto downtown Gastropub that is allegedly known as one of the first Gastropubs that surfaced in this city. From the outside, it looks like a typical British pub serving to the undergraduate crowds. One quick look inside however takes the experience to a whole new level where folks of all ages come for a bite, a pint and a good time.

Executive Chef, Andrew Carter, has taken classic British dishes that have stood the test of time and added his expertise and love of food to create what is now a distinctive pub fare in the city of Toronto. Menu items like the Hand Chopped Burger and Chips are a perfect representation of a timeless pub staple.

The meat patty is made with AAA Canadian sirloin beef and is grounded on the premises and seasoned with spices and, though not 100% confirmed, word has it is also seasoned with bone marrow. It sort of explains why the flavour is so rich and the meat has such a chunky consistency. The bun on the other hand is a sesame seed bun that's made fresh and holds up under the weight of the meaty burger. Chef Carter takes a minimalist approach on this burger, serving it only with the bacon, cheese and house-made ketchup. The rest is up to our taste buds.

If beef is not your thing, worry not. The Queen and Beaver does not leave anybody behind, also serving one of Britain's most famous culinary export - Fish and Chips. Accompanied with home-made tartare, grilled lemon and hand cut chips, the fish and chips add the \"gastro\" in \"pub\" at this local spot. The fresh deep fried fish is slightly flaky, with a non-greasy but crispy batter, while the chips are seasoned just right, cooked just fine, complementing the fried fish quite perfectly.

And what would be of Gastropubs without a great pint or a blonde? The Queen and Beaver knows one does not go without the other, showcasing a local and international selection of beers and ciders. A bold recommendation from the waitress led me to try the Beau's All Natural Lug Tread lagered Ale. All 600 ml of this blonde have never paired so well with the Queen's pub fare.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Husband and 12 ur old son went here for dinner and loved it. They say upstairs, outside*.  The weather was perfect, the view was of the block, and they didn't have the noise of the street.

Started with the pheasant and smoked ham terrine and deviled poached shrimp.  Son like the shrimp so much, he called and asked if we could make this at home.

Main courses: burger for my son and filet for hubby. Both were cooked to order and seasoned well. 

The menu changes weekly. 

Good food, good service, good value. 

*Note:  they have table service in both a pub area and a restaurant area.  The waiter did say, they don't sit kids outside after 8 pm as the pub area gets loud. 

Can't wait for all of us to visit!"}
{"text":"After a summer spent cutting back on  dairy,  meat and carbs,  it was time to chase the gastro dragon! 

The original intention was to hit the stockyards BBQ joint to see what the hype was about. But after a depressing tar scented trek across St Clair W on a humid day we were told they only had burgers and hot dogs available.... move along boys. So we hit the Queen And Beaver. 

First thing you notice is the gorgeous interior. When being seated on the main floor, the second thing you notice is the glut of well dressed after work patrons. You notice this because you are sweaty and clad in H&M jeans and a faded polo tee.  

But service was amazing. The cask conditioned ale was excellent. I would have to give more props to the Ceili Cottage because their choices were more exciting,  but still. 

Back to that relapse... the pork scratchings were amazing. The way bar food should be. Imagine someone made extra thick / extra crispy bacon bits and salted them AND they melted in your mouth. Heaven. 

The hand chopped burger with stilton AND more bacon was divine. My sodium intake just went through the roof. 

Great place for a drink downtown or if you have visitors."}
{"text":"More often than not, pub experiences are usually forgettable; it's hard to differentiate the experience, food and ambience between the establishments. To be honest, most of the time I find myself in pubs because my group of friends and I have failed to reach and agreement on where we can eat, drink and watch a game.

Queen and Beaver is one pub that has pleasantly surprised me with amazing food and service. Any place bold enough to put butter chicken pot pie as the first option under \"main course\" has confidence in their food. Sure, we could go the normal fish and chips route but this may be the first and last time I see butter chicken and pot pie together as one dish on a menu.

Your curiosity and efforts to resist the typical pub favourites will be rewarded In a place like this. My butter chicken was off the charts, with a perfect and authentic taste to your Indian favourite with a English twist. 

The usual suspects are also good and this place gets the little things right: friend got the fish and chips and they grill the lemon for extra flavour and caramelization. Summer soup came with some creme fraiche, fancy sour cream, on top! 

Tips:

- If you are planning to watch a game with friends but like the privacy, ask for the private executive room, which comes equipped with a flat screen tv at your disposal

- They switch up the items on the menu often and the new ones are always worth a try. You'll really see a creative side to pub food and done right!"}
{"text":"This is solely for their house made ketchup. I would funnel that stuff down my throat.II'm not sure if it was curry ketchup since it's a British pub but whatever they used to season it blew my mind. I was spooning that stuff into my mouth.  
But Jesus Christ their chips have ruined my life for even wanting French fries. But, I have to admit I've never had honest to goodness chips before. I see what the fuss is about."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL!  Great food, with a charming warm atmosphere.  The most surprising part was how absolutely terrific the staff was, very helpful and friendly.  A must to visit again!"}
{"text":"The Queen and Beaver has quickly become one of my favourite places to visit since discovering it about 3 months ago.

Located near the Ryerson University area, it is an EXCELLENT alternative to the big, crowded, noisy sports bars around the vicinity (3 Brewers, Jack Astor's, etc.). I would recommend that you head straight up to the upstairs lounge where there's plenty of space, a dedicated bar, and a TV to watch the big game.

The beer selection will be more than sufficient for most looking to grab a pint and the food is excellent. They do British pub classics well, and I'd specifically recommend the hand chopped burger & chips.

Next time you want to see the big game without venturing too close to Yonge-Dundas Square, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I loved the braised duck and potato pie. I thought it would be a single individual pie with cubes of potato but NO! It was a slice of a bigger pie with layers of potato and duck. It was fantastic. Comes with a balsamic vinegar salad which went beautifully. For $19 it's good eats!

The beer is good too! I had the cask of the day, Durham Winter Ale which is fantastic! The \"guest tap\" wasn't from Ontario but was Innis & Gunn. All their beers are in the $7-8 range.

The \"bar food\" are all at a reasonable dinner price. The \"Dinner\" menu is where things get more expensive and you start to question, for $5 more I can get something truly special. I'd say from what I see in pictures of the fish & chips, $18 for one piece of fish is a bit pricy for haddock.

The service is great too. The waiter came by once every while to check on drinks. He \"cooly\" came to put the salt and pepper in the right place to give us an option to order more drinks after we finished our food. He seemed a bit too cool, but was polite, attentive, had all the answers to my questions.

The guy at the front quickly got us a table when the one upstairs was too small. I'd come back again, seems pretty cool. And they got a list of upcoming EPL games in the washroom so I can keep track when to come back and watch."}
{"text":"I had one of the worst roast beef dinners at the Queen and Beaver last night.  It was traditional in that it had roast beef and yorkshire pudding, veg and gravy but no one asked me how I wanted my beef cooked.  it arrived rare which was fine with me and my companion,  but they didn't even ask.  In a good dining room where you're paying $26.00 a plate the server always asks how you would llike your beef cooked. The potatoes were waaay undercooked. Hard and difficult to eat. the whole meal was cold.
I ordered English Breakfast tea and received a very weak Earl Grey.  Maybe they thought I wouldn't notice the difference.  Even with sufficient steeping it was weak - they had too much water for one tea bag.
But the sticky pudding was awesome. Fantastic. They used black treacle and it was served with ice cream and was to die for. 

The whole experience was very disappointing and expensive.  I doubt I will ever set foot in the Queen and Beaver again and will not recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm torn about the rating I've given this restaurant. The service was great and the restaurant had a coolness to it with the use of Brittanic kitsch decor. We were attracted to the restaurant after seeing sardines on the online menu. We figured that anyone who serves sardines is ballsy and deserves to be explored. Alas, no sardines were on the menu when we came.

Hence the rating conundrum. If you like British cuisine (someone called it \"pub food\"), then this is the place for you...and you'd probably give the place five stars. Although the specials sounded fantastic (a veal chop is one I remember), we opted for menu items that we wouldn't find at a typical everyday chop house- pork cheek with white beans and the sweet bread (can't remember the other things that we ordered). Not sure what happened to the white beans but we don't remember them on our plate.

So, if British food is your thing, check this place out."}
{"text":"We happened upon this nifty place when we were searching for a nicer place for a bite that won't break our bank, and it's such a pleasant surprise. On a sunny Sunday mid morning, patronage is still sparse, and we can have a nice conversation while enjoying the relaxing environment. Wait staff is friendly and helpful. While the food is not superb, it's quite decent. Prices for brunch are reasonable too. The converted place still retains decor from another bygone era, which is nice. I'll surely visit again, should I be in the area."}
{"text":"Limited brunch offerings; well executed but very little value. The cost is on par with much trendier, ingredient rich menu offerings in the same neighbourhood. Nice beer selection on tap and the ambience is very pleasant."}
{"text":"This was a great find. A proper English pub run by an Englishman. The food is excellent as is the selection of beers and wines. The staff are friendly and attentive. Try the Scotch egg's they are great. There is also a nice patio upstairs for those warm summer months. I will definitely be going back there."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I can't really review this place because I went during the Euro Cup and the place was packed!  We ended up getting a table on the 2nd floor patio and luckily didn't have to wait.  We ordered the fish & chips.  It was pretty good.  I don't think I would go back solely on the fish & chips.  I would go back to try other items on the menu and watch a sports game on the 2nd floor where they have a large tv over a chimney ad comfy looking couches."}
{"text":"A traditional English \"gastro-pub\".  Much. much higher quality food than you would find at a Firken - excellent curries, fish and chips and toasts.  A great selection of beers.  The atmosphere is very cosy and homey - mismatched plates, vintage looking wallpaper.  Waitresses are very friendly and knowledgeable.  A good choice for a low key evening with friends."}
{"text":"Lovely bar!!! I actually think this has the potential to become my favourite - no idea how I've missed it before (maybe because it's hidden on friggin Elm St....)

It looks like it used to be a very posh house, something Alexander Bell might have lived in? Or Sherlock Holmes. There are a bunch of tables downstairs where people were eating stuff BUT the upstairs was what I fell in love with. 

THE COUCH! OMG THE COUCH!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so 'Friends'.....it's big, comfy and there are a couple chairs around it. A huge TV for you fellow soccer fans and amazing, local wheat beers on tap. The atmosphere was great - I heard a lot of accents, Irish, etc. so I'm guess if the locals are bringing their touristy friends here it must be the spot. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Ma blonde est cute. Et pauvre. Elle m'a invitée ici pour mon anniversaire. Je suis très satisfaite.

Ambiance vraiment relax de pub anglais, avec de la bouffe une coche plus fancy. J'ai pris le cobbler, un scone au cheddar dans un mélange de sauce à la bière, de champignons et de steak, avec un side de carottes. 

QUEL DOUX DÉLICE POUR MES PAPILLES DE BIRTHDAY GIRL. 

Mon amoureuse a pris le pithivier aux champignons. UN AUTRE DÉLICE.

Le staff est super sympa aussi. Une serveuse trop drôle nous explique que le
spécial anniversaire, c'est de mettre une chandelle sur le dessert. Je me contente de peu alors je suis amplement satisfaite !!! En plus elle est vraiment pince-sans-rire (la serveuse, pas la chandelle) alors je suis extra charmée.

On s'en sort avec une facture pas si mal et le belly content. C'est OUI!!"}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful time in this charming pub on Elm Street. My group descended after dinner and headed to the 2nd floor for a drink. We congregated around an old sofa in front of the large screen tv. This was the space large enough to accommodate a group of 8.

The interior has quaint touches of olden days with the exposed brick, old wood fireplace (which is only a decoration now), old clock showing London time. The drinks list is fair enough that I believe most people would be satisfied. They serve a special edition of Muskoka, Innis & Gunn, Steamwhistle, cask ale, and an extensive wine list.

A magnificent time was had by all."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest pubs I have ever seen with wooden tables and chairs, green banquettes, yellow walls, old paintings, there's just so much to love. There are so many different patterns, textures, and different moldings on the lower level that it is hard to not feel absolutely comfortable. There are perfectly placed sofas and furniture pieces that don't match but blend together very well.

Come upstairs and you'll be transported to the perfect spot for watching a little footie. The space holds a separate bar, small rooftop patio, a large TV, and many places to kick back and enjoy the match.

Service here is great, sometimes a little slow but for the most part it's right on point. The server always has great pairing recommendations for your meal and is very knowledgeable of the menu items.

The food here is probably some of the best pub food I have ever tried. I had the soccer pie which is just a delicious version of a steak and mushroom pie was perfectly fluffy and just the right amount of gravy. For dessert I had the sticky toffee pudding. I found it a little sweet but was balanced well with the ice cream.

Overall, this is my favorite pub to hide away into while stuck in the hustle and bustle of tourist central. Prices are a little steep but the quality of food is great. The beer choices are also fantastic. If you haven't gone, be sure to stop into this classy pub spot."}
{"text":"I've read a lot of good reviews about this place and it was close to the hotel I was staying at so I decided to come here alone, on my last night in Toronto for dinner. It was quiet when I stepped in, maybe because it was Easter Sunday, but I liked that anyway. The first floor is more of sit down dining, and the second floor more of a lounge. The place looked like an old house, creaking hard wood floor, and smelled of stewed meat...in a good way.
I went to the second floor and sat at the bar. I ordered a beer to start and looked over the menu. I decided on scotch egg and the duck and potato pie. While I was waiting there was a group on the couch going on and on about soccer and football, sound kinda heated too. The egg came on a old school floral rimmed plate. It was basically an egg that was parboiled and had a crust with tons of seasonings, it was good and interesting. The duck pie came with a side of mixed greens and it was a pretty big portion, I took my first bite and immediately like the flavor, as I keep eating it though I realized the potatoes were a bit under cooked...they had a slight crunch to them. I wish I had more room for dessert, the puddings looked good on the menu."}
{"text":"Came back here for a second date with Ms. Brooks Brothers. We both had the fish and chips. I have to say, the best I've had in a pub in Toronto. The batter and fries are both seasoned in an interesting and hard to determine way. Ms. Brooks Brothers seemed impressed with the decor and food as well as \"off the beaten path\" nature."}
{"text":"This place is very nice. Whenever I can envision a restaurant being my apartment (as was the case for the upstairs lounge) then that's a good sign off the bat. It's draped in English football history so this is definitely a place you might want to check our while cheering for England in the upcoming World Cup (or want to avoid, pending on how you feel about male bonding and sports).

The decor is very nice and cozy. They have a large HD television in front of a living room setting and lots of exposed brick. It was freezing outside the night I went, but they have a large patio looking out onto Elm Street that I am sure is the place to be in the summer.

My friends ordered staples like fish & chips and burgers but I went against the grain and got a BLT, which I regret. It's not that it wasn't good, but the bacon were basically tubed shaped and very thick. So instead of strips I felt like I was eating a burger made of pork. I tried some of my friend's fries and they were pretty delicious. My BLT came with crisps, but they weren't Walker's -- more like discount kettle chips. Oh well. I still ate the whole thing.

They don't have much on tap, and beware because even though it says 7 dollars on the menu they charge you 8 \"because of tax.\" Even when you order from the bar, which is totally foreign to me. So including a tip per beer I was paying a whopping 9 dollars for a pint of beer. Quite ridiculous. The staff weren't exactly too pleasant either.

Having said all that though, I still enjoyed my evening. I liked the little things like little soccer balls in the urinals that you can pee on. Definitely amusing once you've had a few 9 dollar beers."}
{"text":"Awesome real English vibe. Honestly, the pies are great. They even had mushy peas, which for me was ironic as I was commenting to friends just the other day how much I missed them! Service is good, makes for a fancy draft beer hangout and a delicious meal. Good date night location!"}
{"text":"This is a great space, it's definitely a great spot for an after work drink! That said, I came here with a larger group, and we really struggled with the poor service. We waited 20 minutes just to even see the dinner menus? Maybe the server thought that we were waiting for the rest of our party, but it is still a pub, why would service be so formal? Mostly, we felt forgotten. Food was very rich and quite greasy, but still satisfying for pub food. Drinks were on the small side. Won't go out of our way to go back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in downtown Toronto because it's absolutely delicious with a classy but comfortable atmosphere. I've had the pork chop with apple slaw and nettle dumplings (best pork chop around) and the Sunday roast beef, which comes with a delicious gravy and Yorkshire pudding. You get an amazing value for what you're paying. Make sure you save room for dessert because the homemade ice creams are to die for (whiskey gingerbread and salted caramel are a must!)"}
{"text":"This is a nice gastropub with old-school flavour...downstairs is more of a restaurant with a street-level patio and upstairs is a parlour room lounge (very cool place to drink) with a second-floor patio. Cocktails are good, beer selection is nice, and the menu is definitely of the gastro variety...expect to find some fairly unusual offerings, such as rabbit jowl and ox cheek.

But I didn't try any of that chi-chi; I went straight for the \"hand-chopped\" burger. And I have to say, it left me remarkably disappointed.

Craving a gourmet cheeseburger, I debated over trying the $18 version at Marben (Wellington) versus the $18 version at Queen & Beaver. Both burgers have had good magazine write-ups and reviews on yelp. I chose Q&B and was served a burger patty that was not ground, but chopped into large chunks (probably sirloin/chuck mix but I'm not sure). I ordered it medium with cheddar and bacon. The meat itself was fatty and not so tasty and the whole burger was just kinda bleh. I needed to dress it up with condiments. Compared to the $18 burger at Harbord Room, which is RIDICUTARDEDLY GOOD (so good I had to invent a new adverb to describe it) and is RTB (ready to bite) without any extra condiments, the Q&B version just isn't in the same league. But on the upside, the fries were great!"}
{"text":"Very cozy atmosphere. Good place for sharing a drink. I would reserve this place for a special occasion since i find the portions small and the prices on the higher end."}
{"text":"Tasty brunch food with an eclectic twist. Its got a cozy vibe and a feel of the authentic British taste. Would recommend for brunch!"}
{"text":"24 hours later and I am still thinking of my wonderful dinner! After an 8 mile run, my husband and I ventured through the snowy streets of Toronto to eat at Queen & Beaver. It was well worth it!! We split a fab bottle of Spanish red wine. 
Starters: oxtail & dumplings soup and the ox tongue & mushrooms on toast. Heavenly! We did order a Scotch egg to split. It was delicious but cold. I have a feeling that is how they serve it. 
Entrees: venison & wild mushroom cobbler and shepherd's pie. So amazing!!!!
Dessert: Yorkshire curd tart & sticky toffee pudding. The sticky toffee pudding was to die for! The curd tart was good, but not what we expected. 

All in all, it was a perfect date night! Great service, ambiance, noise level, etc!"}
{"text":"Decent brunch, though bacon for my Full English was cooked to death., everything else was pretty good though. A decent selection of beers and other spirits. Service was friendly, if a little slow. The only absurdity of the whole thing was our ordering coffee. Mugs, milk and sugar came out, but it wasn't until much later we had to prompt the waiter to actually bring the coffee.

That said, the menu has both some traditional pub fare and more unique offerings, and the setting is comfortable and friendly, not unlike the classic public house.

They have footie on every weekend upstairs, I'm told.

Prices are a little high, but overall, other than my bacon, the food was impressive."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and managed to pop in at 10 pm for a late dinner.

Had the local McAuslan Cream Ale -- very new to me and very awesome

Entree was the marrow crusted veal striploin with dandelion and garlic scape.  I don't know what the hell scape is, but it was awesome too.  It was perfectly seasoned, some bits of pine nuts, properly salted, good texture and on top of a delicious broth.  Every element of this dish was tasty.  The marrow crust was lightly herbed with rosemary.  My only complaint is that the portion was small (veal was maybe ~4 oz).  Don't order it if you're really hungry.

Finished with sticky toffee pudding and vanilla ice cream.  Fantastic pudding and ice cream, but the semi-salty caramel sauce was too sweet.  It did have a really deep, rich depth of flavor overall, just a little too sweet -- needs something to cut that."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. It feels like you're in somebody's house.

My girlfriend and I came here for drinks only. Staff were very friendly, and we sat on the upstairs patio. As this was a drinks only visit, I can't say anything about the food but judging by other reviews will definitely stop back here to get something to eat next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place feels like where Harry Potter might hang out, the apartment of his footballer uncle, who's really cool because he lets Harry drink beer. But don't be fooled! For the dressed-down nature of the upstairs bar (or Harry's Uncle's Basement), the food is quite adventuresome (Scottish egg, hand-cut chips with curried catsup, etc.) and the cocktails are spot-on. We caught the end of an NFL game, while perched on a dimpled leather sofa, enjoying a \"Winston Churchill\" (Gin, Applejack, smoke, etc.). Really enjoyed this place..."}
{"text":"Came in here for a pint or two on a Saturday afternoon. Really was looking for a relaxing pub to just chill in for a bit after walking the city. So many of the \"pubs\" in the downtown area are really just restaurants, but the Q&B had a really nice sitting room upstarts with couches and comfy chairs which was perfect. The servers were great as well which only enhanced the overall ambiance!! A fantastic place and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. I had sardines and smoked tomatoes. It was very good. However, the side salad was extremely tart. The atmosphere was a bit stuffy."}
{"text":"My favorite gastropub. The decor is very casual but I love their british pub food. I am a big fan of their hand chopped burger, while the crispy rabbit, fish n chips and oxtail soup were all tasty. I also tried the prime rib with the dripping chips, which I guess isn't always on the menu. The sticky toffee pudding is a super dessert. 
The price is a tad bit high but for the ambiance and the food, I think it's a good deal. Plus their beer selection is awesome."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with two friends and had a lovely time. The decor of the home is beautiful and was unexpected from the front. I also expected to see more pub fare but was surprised to find the cuisine more upscale with pub favorites. The home is cozy and welcoming with antique furniture all around. There was a good  mix of people from families, groups of friends and co-workers enjoying a drink after work. We were greeted immediately and seated. I would recommend making a reservation as the restaurant looked fairly full. Our service throughout our meal was a bit lacking, the dessert menu took awhile to reach us after our meals and we didn't have a consistent waiter which I found interesting. However, the food was good. I ordered their fish and chips, light and crispy batter on haddock with nicely salted fries. They also make a homemade ketchup with a touch of cumin that was delicious. My other two guests ordered the burger which you can customize the cook and the chicken confit salad which looked appetizing. There were plenty of drink options with beers, wine and specialty drinks as well and they have a small patio area in the front. A perfect place for a first date or a hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"This pub has an interesting setup. The bottom floor looks like a proper restaurant with reservations, seating times and probably fancy linen. I walked in on a random Thursday night with no reservations and there was space available on the ground floor but with a one hour seating limit. Not wanting to be rushed, I chose to venture upstairs instead and I'm so glad I did!  The second floor is more relaxed with a first come first serve policy, couches and an outdoor patio. It's a great space, almost like someone's attic transformed into a large living room with a friendly bartender. 
We spent several hours there, having drinks, moving to dinner, watching the game and catching up. Our waitress was excellent, getting the feel of the group and largely leaving us alone to our own devices. I had the Bangers and Mash which was hearty and well seasoned. Bangers tend to be too salty most times, but they found the right balance here! Will definitely be back to check out the patio next time."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a mate.  Busy place, authentic British pub atmosphere.  Very busy, loud, good crowd.  I had a burger and fries, would give the burger a 3 out of 10 on taste - had many better. Not bad, good spicy beef. Fresh bun.  Fried were good. But the standard for burgers is defiantly higher in this town!  Plus it was tiny, a slider really so more like a 2 out of ten.  My friend had the lamb curry. A little better but also not great. It would be a solid 6 out of ten."}
{"text":"We were 3 people. We had appetizers although I cannot find mine on their website. I ordered a Smoked Salmon paté on a bread. I got a cup of solid salmon paté and rock-bread. I had to scoop in out with a spoon. I am no expert on British cuisine but I hate pretentiousness and cunning food titles designed to pass off barely edible food. It tasted strange too. 

I ordered Tea and got a choice of English Breakfast, Orange Pekoe and some kind of Green tea. My friend ordered the other paté and she was pleased with it. 

The Service - The waitress had a Robot cum General like manner, mouthing off specials and offerings in a less than pleasant tone, interrupting my friend and acting like a drill sergeant in general. Her tone and vibe were unfriendly. 

The ambience is great but I do not think I would go back there. I like food and friendly service and in establishments that purport to be upscale such as this one, I would like some good manners."}
{"text":"I didn't get good service when I went for brunch. The waitress never came back to pour more water and didn't ask how the food was. They couldn't take debit that day and they had to do manual receipts for credit cards, which the waitress didn't even bring to me. 
My friend and I did not like the food at all, especially the black pudding. I will not go back. This city has way, way better places for brunch."}
{"text":"Heavy food but delicious. Eclectic decor and friendly staff. Ample seating on two floors. Ordered salmon eggs benny and it was tangy and super filling with scones/ biscuits in replacement of English muffin. 

I'd come back here again- but on a completely empty stomach."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pub in the city. There's no attitude, it's a nice homey place with fantastic foods, they show hockey upstairs AND there are tasteful queen and beaver-related decorations.

They have great beer on tap, a decent wine list and the food is also totally delicious. I can eat all of the yummy foods without feeling like I need to hit the gym after.

Win-Win!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a rainy Monday afternoon.

Sat by the kitchen, where they were baking bread, to warm up a bit since we were wet.

Had a beer and ordered some food.

Had the Curry Steamed Mussels and Chips ($16 Canadian) as an appetizer. Very tasty and good.

For the main course we had the Rare Roast Beef & Horseradish sandwich ($18 Canadian) and the Midlands Lamb Curry ($23 Canadian). We were both disappointed. I think my sandwich had three razor thin slices of roast beef on it and my other half said her dish was all sauce with very little lamb.

The place has a nice atmosphere, but the food is overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Pros: Food is not pub food, but actual good food. Service is very friendly/warm, and the prices are right. 

Cons: Seating can be difficult, especially for larger parties (4+)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night for dinner with a friend. I got the burger since it was highly recommended by everyone. The burger itself wasn't bad, especially when you add their mustard to the patty which gave it a bit of a kick. The 3 strands of pickled green beans that accompanied the dish looked pathetic and unappetizing though.. I think those green beans did more harm than good for the plate.

The fries, or \"chips\" as the Brits call it, we're alright. They were the thick cut fries that appeared to be deep fried multiple times but they weren't as crispy as I would've liked."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant, especially for making English food taste so good. I had the $17 burger, which was well worth it. 

The customer service was OK (a little slow), but the waiting room on the second floor is really cool. You can sit, watch a movie, and hang out. It has that living room feel. The patio is really nice, overlooking Elm Street.

Although this place is a little pricey, it was delicious, unique and I would definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"As a Brit living in the US I have been to my fair share of \"British \" pubs in the US and found the vast majority to be rather far away from the real thing - but on a trip to Toronto we found this gem around the corner from our hotel and given the fact we had been traveling since 3am with nothing but a granola bar and bad airline coffee - good British food with a beer sounded just the thing - and it was 


I was  immediately transported back home as it reminded me of one of the many quaint pubs in my hometown. Small, cozy and filled with British artifacts ( and British staff) it had a nice charm about it ! 

The food was quintessentially British - my husband and daughter had fish and chips and the fudge was the closest I have ever seen to that you would find in a British Chippy !! I tried the eggs Benedict which was served on some kind of cheese scone which was delicious and our other child  enjoyed a bacon butty - a classic dish for any Brit!!

We tried some great IPAs , the only thing I did not love was the Caesar which to be fair tasted British as it seemed to be nothing more than some tomato juice and gin - it was missing the essential trimmings of horseradish , pepper , Worcester - and was overpriced for its simplicity and size !! That says the beer and great service made up for it !!

Loved the setting , food and service and would be happy to visit again on this trip"}
{"text":"A great selection of ales and satisfying pub food at this Toronto staple.  Definitely a cut above the usual pub fare and very nice bar upstairs. A wee slice of Britannia amongst the Canadians"}
{"text":"I realllllly wanted to find a proper pub in Toronto. The Queen and Beaver was exactly what I was hoping for. 

When we walked in, we were asked if we were eating or drinking. I told the host that we were gonna to hang out and have a few drinks, and probably end up eating as well, so he sat us in the upstairs bar area. This is exactly where we belonged. Imagine setting up a comfortable living room, but with the idea that food and beer would magically appear for you, and this is what it's like. Couches and comfortable chairs all set around a large TV. 

The bartender was great. Pleasant but unobtrusive. The beer selection was great as well. I was tempted by the rotating casks, but cream ale on draught is too amazing to pass up, so I went with McAuslin. My wife fell in love with Pimm's Cup. 

We were in-between meal services, but the bar menu was perfectly sufficient for us. I got bar nuts to snack on, while my wife got a scotch egg. We also got some lamb ribs to snack on. While paying $6 for a cup of nuts isn't something I'd do every day, these were a wonderful assortment of various nuts covered in a sweet spiced coating. Worth every penny. My wife enjoyed her egg, but we found the lamb ribs to be a little plain and not very warm. This was the only imperfection of the entire visit, but I enjoyed everything else so much that 5* is still appropriate.

After hanging out for a while, we each ordered the haddock and chips. These were amazing. Just exactly what you hope for when you order this pub staple. 

Whether it's a seated meal in the downstairs dining room, or lounging upstair, I can't recommend Q&B enough if you enjoy the pub atmosphere. They do it right."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best burgers I have ever had. The atmosphere is great and football (soccer) is always on. It is the place to be if you are looking for a good selection of local beers. Definitely one of the hidden gems of Toronto. I'm from Atlanta so I know a good burger when I see one. It's a great English Pub!"}
{"text":"This place really let me down. I had reservations for a Saturday evening. The restaurant itself is super cute and wonderfully decorated. Service was pretty terrible. Our initial server was unpleasant and halfway through we were switched to a non-existent server. I'm not sure which one I preferred. Our waters were not refilled and we had such a hard time flagging her down to get the bill. The food was not good at all. I had the mushroom pithivier. It was lukewarm/cold and did not taste freshly made. It was overly salty which was even worse as I didn't have any water ! The side salad was okay. Definitely would not return."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special burger and fries on a weekday for lunch. To my surprise, it was not ground beef but steak slices. Also came with peameal bacon and cheese. Pleasant surprise. Had never had a burger with slices of steak falling out after each bite. Portions are a bit small in comparison to other burgers, especially for $20!"}
{"text":"ok, so first off I have to say that I like the place, the feel was very englishly and it was more like a place to relax rather than your typical bar. But it get some thumbs down points because they did not have Stella or Bud. Now, I figure that's because they are an English pub, but come on if you don't have Stella then at least have bud. So will I go back, probably on a date. it wasn't too noise so you can talking and it an over all nice place to sit down and have a chat,"}
{"text":"I did not eat here but stopped in because as Leslie Nielsen said \"nice beaver\".

Great little spot.  Love the public house where you can eat, drink, and socialize.  The bar and social areas are a bit tight(without the outside open) but the crowd and vibe are excellent.  Craft cocktails are very good and I think they are close to a mixologist class bar upstairs.

The food appeared to be a cross of eclectic and classic pub/public house.  Would enjoy working through it at some point in the future.

Would go back in a heartbeat.  Better to go with friends than alone.  It is a public house...  :)"}
{"text":"Bring snacks and something to read to pass the time while you wait for someone to notice you've moved in. But when someone does notice, he or she will likely be attractive and kind. Food is either spot on or epic failure, which is what happens when you're committed to reinventing traditional British pub favourites."}
{"text":"Went to Toronto for the American Thanksgiving break, and ate here on Friday night.  The place was interesting and recommended by the concierge from our hotel.  I had the fish and chips while my husband had the rabbit special.  The food was good.  The service was ok, but no one came back to fill water glasses which is a pet peeve of mine!  Overall, it wasn't bad but it wasn't excellent based on how the concierge was raving about it.  I probably would go again and try something else.  It was crowded and we didn't have a reservation, but we were seated rather quickly and the maître d' kept checking on us throughout the meal to make sure we were satisfied."}
{"text":"The burger is overhyped.  Does not deserve the best burger in T.O. crown.  It is good and very different from any burger you have probably tried before, the seasoning threw me and my friends off.  2 of them wouldn't even finish it.  And yeah, their house ketchup is disgusting.

Fish and chips were pretty bad.  Can get better just about anywhere.

I give 3 stars as the hand chopped burger is original and different and with only tasting 2 menu items i have to give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"\"Sure, Ivan. We can meet at the Queen and Beaver for lunch today\". I said thinking it was probably like one of the firkins. 

It is definitely not one of the firkins!

Classy Victorian atmosphere with some authentic pub charm. I actually felt great just walking in. Ended up going straight upstairs to a wonderful couch and chair seating balanced perfectly between home comfort and out in public wearing a suit and tie. 

The servers were all very 5 star restaurant professional and warm at the same time. And it is one of those great places where you can show up in a suit and tie or jeans and a t-shirt and feel right at home. Oh and they love their football (soccer for the North Americans) so just fantastic all around. 

I had the lamb curry and my friend had the daily quiche and a pheasant and ham open face sandwich. Everything looked great and the curry was spicy and excellent. I was very happy that it had no dairy and the server was very careful to make sure it did not. 

I finished the entire large portion. And my friend happily finished off both of his smaller dishes (which were not so small after all). 

Price wise it is above a pub and below a classy sit down. My curry was $20.   

I enjoyed the Queen and Beaver experience very much and will definitely keep it on file for business or casual lunches or dinners in the future and you should too!"}
{"text":"Waffled around between three and four stars but I'm feeling generous. Four stars it is. 

As previous reviewers have said, a bit pricey, delightfully English, and delicioso! (Can I mix languages like that?)

The interior definitely floats my boat. Imagine the den of an English professor--fires, armchairs, wooden panelling, the whole nine yards. Beautiful decor. 

Going along with the atmosphere of the inside, I ordered an old fashioned. Solid choice, a little on the sweet side but the citrus was strong like I like it. 

Had the pork belly. One word: perfection. 

We were here with ten people, so the bill split out pretty messily. I know requesting separate bills is a lot when there are so many people, but if you're going to automatically add an 18% gratuity charge, I feel like it's a small thing to ask for. Instead, all the items came on one big bill so we had to take turns going to the register to pay. The last person to pay ended up with an extra $15 on his bill so clearly our group did some dubious math, but as we were trying to work it out, the server was noticeably pretty impatient and anxious. She might have been worried we'd leave the extra $15 on her, but coming by to confront us about it made us all feel uncomfortable. 

On the other hand...great tasting food and drinks, love the feel of the place. Probably would come back for a semispecial occasion to justify the price, maybe with a smaller group."}
{"text":"Always suggest it to tourists or locals... as the one real British pub in the city. A true gem.

Upstairs, is a great place to watch the premier league, have a casual meeting or simply lounge in an almost library atmosphere. The drink selection is decent (awesome Pimms)

Food is excellent - only deduct it one star as service can be spotty."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a group of friends and most of us got the hand chopped burger and chips. I'd give it 3.5 stars for taste but just 2 stars for value. 

It was a good burger:
- The burger patty was chopped (instead of ground like burgers elsewhere). I usually like it when places try to be a bit different, so credit to Queen and Beaver for that. And while the first few bites piqued my interest, chopping up the burger patty made it seem a bit gainy-er to me and the consistency wasn't as good. I kinda wonder if I would've thought it tasted better if they had just ground the beef straight up.
- The one big benefit of the chopped method though was it's effect on the cheese. I got stinton blue cheese (the other choice was cheddar I think) and it was like the cheese was melted into (versus just on) the patty. I love cheese, so I like how every bite seemed almost like a beef-cheese pop in my mouth.
- The real star of the burger was the bacon: two thick slabs, a great smoky flavour.
-  They gave a generous side serving of fries (standard, not overly salty) and they provided a nice fresh tomato mix to dip them in.

However, while the burger was good, it cost $20, which is in line with other higher end burgers. That said, I'd much rather get burgers at Holy Chuck or Burger's Priest that are a tad cheaper and in my opinion taste better.

Some other feedback:
- My other friends got the house made quiche and salad . They said it was well made, though flavouring was a bit bland. The serving was very generous though.
- Service was prompt and courteous, and our server was very attentive with refilling water for our table.
- They saw we were a pretty big group (10 people) and put us in a separate area. Kudos to them for that. The only problem though is it was right beside the kitchen, so throughout our meal we could hear the cooks shouting out the orders that were ready.

All in all, an ok place for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been going to this bar for years now and it is by far one of the best old school bar experiences you can have in the city. The beers are varied and interesting, including daily cask beer options. The food is beyond good - the hand chopped burger my favourite. The staff is friendly and welcoming. 

Downstairs is more of a restaurant, and perfect for dates. Upstairs is more of a lounge with couches and books everywhere. There's also a patio on the roof that's great for late night summer dates. The downstairs streetside patio is great for groups of friends just drinking. 

This is one of those Elm St. gems you must experience."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had in my life.  Quaint, charming place with excellent service.  The eggs benedict will blow your mind."}
{"text":"This is a two floor pub with a dining area downstairs and a pub area and patio upstairs.  They have a unique selection of draft beer although I strongly recommend the Chambley.  It's a clean and refreshing tasting beer.  

Their food selection is also really good.  Unlike most bars, I would say that they put a lot more effort and thought into their dishes and it actually tastes like a chef has cooked your food and not a minimum waged teenage employee.  I've had their charred fish and their fish and chips and both were very tasty and not too oily.  I think the fries were amazing and on par with the ones served at Beer Bistro, which I think are the best in Toronto.  The portion sizes are decent - not too big and not too small."}
{"text":"First time trying a scotch egg! Super tasty. Also ordered a fish fry and it was probably one of the best fish fry's I've ever had."}
{"text":"A bit late on this review, but i recently had a birthday dinner at Q&B and it was fantastic. We were a group of 20 and had the Parlour Room to ourselves. They have a series of family style roasts you can select from. We had the Traditional Roast Beef and Yorkshire pudding with roast veggies - fantastic. Perfectly cooked and delicious. 

What I loved about Q&B is how easy they made everything. I had been in touch with about 5 other restaurants in DT Toronto and they were all super complicated - needed Special Events contracts and Admin fees etc. Josh at Q&B totally took care of us and made everything super simple so all I had to do was confirm final numbers then show up and chow down. I highly recommend this place if you have a large group and want just really tasty comfort food with no hassles.

I've been here a few times to watch soccer and for drinks as well and had good experiences, but this last birthday feast has made me a fan. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice - once in the dining room and once in the pub upstairs. The meals cost about $5 more than the same meal at another pub but the taste and quality far exceeds what you'll find elsewhere. The beer selection is solid with a couple of cask beers available.

Not a lot of choice for vegetarians, but there are a few vegetarian items on the menu and they're delicious! I'd never heard of a pithivier before, but know I know I like them!

Fish and chips: fish was light and crispy and fries were perfect. Bangers and mash: savoury with a rich onion gravy and housemade sausages (with stilton cheese inside) were a unique twist on a classic meal.

What makes the Queen and Beaver great is the atmosphere. They're really going for a traditional English pub feel and it's one of a kind in Toronto."}
{"text":"What a delightfully canadian name. Good fish and chips, ok mussels, good selection of english and canadian beers. The fish and chips came with this small dish of house ketchup that was particularly good. The upstairs pub area is nice and cozy and if you have a meal downstairs, grab a drink up top as well.

There's a great portrait downstairs of her majesty holding a beaver that's not to be missed."}
{"text":"There's something about a well-curated English Pub / restaurant that I find deeply comforting, and I know just what it is: Unity. 

Think about it. \"Canadian (New),\" or \"American (New)\" you really have no idea what the hell you could be walking into. Yes, chefs / owners come up with a baseline m.o. that connects all the dots on their business, but one point of that is the elements are left up to the whim of the designer they hire and the other point is the menu. Is the menu anything but styling the choices around trends? Do we need another curious placement of pork belly? Do we need bacon in our orange juice? And do we need another mention of something cooked in something that you can't place when you eat it so it only matters that you read it? Okay, in fact, likely, yes. Those folks do have a place in that they're figuring out new ways to take on a trend, buck them or even create their own. 

Now, that's not to say an English pub, or this place, is at all immune to the effects of design or trends. In this case, when you walk in you feel you're in a home, and you know straight away that it's an English pub / restaurant. There's security in the known quantity. There's security in strong hospitality too. They were as welcoming as the warm environment. 

The upstairs is cozy, and seat yourself, the downstairs isn't too big so reservations are recommended. The bar seating downstairs is where we ended up. Walk ins are welcomed and full service is available. While the burger was delicious, I should've gone with the venison pie. Having a burger on my birthday had a strong enough appeal to woo me. The scotch egg is impressively deep fried. Don't doubt how much it'll fill you up. 

Often pubs can attract a mixed crowd from surly to soft spoken saints, but this seemed to attract a crowd tied together by being comfortable, casual and not unhinged despite all the Imperial pints. 

If I worked in the area, this would be a staple to after work drinks, or dinners, and likely stealing away next to the fire place for lunch. There are great expectations that come with being a known quantity, and this place exceeds them with executing every staple, and giving the English pub a new level of warmth."}
{"text":"This public house is beyond outstanding
(and I truly am intentionally grandstanding)!
I'll tell the whole tale
including sports and ale
for future guests to benefit from my fanding.

My man's 30th fell on AFC Sat
when the Ravens took on our dear Pats.
On vacation in Toronto
we could not miss the game, so
I was desperate to find a watching spot, stat.

Queen and Beaver reassured me, \"You're on point!\"
Suffice to say, they did not disappoint.
A prime table in the lounge
where coziness abounds,
and a Patriots victory rounded out the joint.

If dark wood and deep leather are your jam,
and of superb service you are a fan,
you'll never want to leave
this place of reprieve:
A spot of English well-served and well-ran."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to places in downtown Toronto.  

First, although unorthadox for a British pub, they have a decent draft selection which includes one or two cast conditioned ales.  

The food is not a carbon copy of the numerous irish nacho serving pub chains which litter every street corner.  Instead, it highlights traditional British flavours.  

Snacks like Scotch eggs, a bag of chips and scratchings as well as different toasts, British cheeses and traditional entrees fill the menu.

In particular, they have one of the underrated burgers in town.  The rabbit and potato pie is to die for.  

If that's not your fancy, look out for the blackboard specials.  Last time I had a short rib and Stilton pudding which was divine. 

To finish things off, try the sticky toffee pudding.  It's one of the best I've every had. It is moist and you can taste the treacle.

If anything the bar fills up quickly, the seating is a bit awkward and the staff can be a little crusty at times bit then again, us Brits have perfected the art of misery.

God save the queen."}
{"text":"This is a cosy English style pub located in the heart of toronto. We walked in here on a Wednesday night at around 8 pm without making reservations, since the weather was nice we decide to sit outside at the patio. This place has two floors, and they have a patio upstairs as well, however, it was packed on the night we visited so we seated at the patio downstairs.

Staffs were friendly, but a little slow on service, we didn't get the menu after 15 mins we were seated, but I guess they didn't expect it would be busy on a Wednesday night as well. 

After going over the menu, my friend decided to get their haddock and chips, a well known traditional food in United Kingdom. And I had my mind set on the salmon and watercress pesto wellington. 

After around 30-40 mins, our food finally arrived! (Thank god we had beer  while the wait) The haddock was beautifully done, crispy outside juicy inside. Loved their fries on the side as well. My salmon Wellington was very delicious as well, along with the creamy sauce. The salmon was cooked perfectly, this is highly recommended. 

Overall, this is a very nice place to hang out and have a chat with your friend with awesome English dishes, or maybe just even for a beer."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new pub near by and found this place from yelp. The establishment reminded me of an old house which had really cool british decor and very very cute.

My coworker ordered the Innis & Gunn Scotch Barrel Aged Beer and I ordered the Winter Pimms (Pimms no. 1, gin, chai apple syrup, ginger ale). The beer tasted kind of like rickard's red with a different but great after taste.  He loved his beer a lot!! My Winter Pimms was fruity and refreshing. We also shared the fish and chips which had very crispy fries and the batter on the fish was on point. The dips that came along with the dish tasted really funny, so we stuck to ketchup. 

The prices were slightly on the pricer side but all together it was a great experience and we would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Great little soccer bar. Smoked haddock kedgeree was stupid good. Would recommend.  Servers were very pleasant and on hard working."}
{"text":"Really 3.5 stars for me. Food was well priced and tasty but didn't blow me away. I would eat here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"We were seated in the cozy front room by the window, nice! and unfortunately a raging hot radiator, not so nice.
The terrine/apple compote app was surprisingly tasty. My wife enjoyed her well prepared chicken while I did less well with a beef,olive and spinach concoction whose name I don't recall.
Server was friendly but unsure of the menu and had some difficulty opening a neighbours bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Amazing little pub - gourmet food and cream ale on tap. Checkout the nice comfy 2nd floor"}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends after 9pm for some drinks. We looked upstairs for some seating but it was totally full, we went back down stairs and saw two available tables. However we were told by the host that downstairs is usually for people that are eating. We sat at a table and then our server came and gave this huge aggressive speech about how downstairs is only for people that are having dinner and if anyone came that wanted dinner she would have to ask us to leave. It was quite awkward. And not less than 30minutes later the place was almost empty, so not even sure why there was the need for the big speech.

Also, this place is uber not vegetarian friendly. Do not go here for food if you are vegetarian as there are NO vegetarian options.

Pluses - good atmosphere and decor. I would recommend this place only for drinks. 
Also seems a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Julie and I were in town for 3 nights staying at a nearby hotel. After night 1 we ended up dining here three nights in a row. Based in reviews we opted to eat in the cozy upstairs room.

Fish and chips were so good Julie had all 3 nights.  I had same night one, burger 2 and flatiron steak 3. Burger was a little too salty and at medium a little more done than I expected - order Med rare is my suggestion. Steak was tender and tasty. 

Staff was excellent and night 2 waitress remembered what we had ordered night before. A real pro. 

Prices are reasonable. 

You will like this place."}
{"text":"I came to the Queen and Beaver for a late Saturday lunch, right after arriving to Toronto by bus. My husband and I were starving and the restaurant was only offering its pub menu at the time, but we thought the choices would be adequate.
 
After reading other Yelp reviews ahead of time, we first went upstairs to sit, but it was very busy, so we decided to go back downstairs to sit. We sat at the downstairs bar, which was empty besides the servers and us at the time. Personally, I found the quieter downstairs area much nicer than upstairs. The servers were also very pleasant.
 
I had the mushroom pithivier, which came out looking like a slice of cake with some salad. The pithivier consisted of lots of layers of thinly sliced potato, a layer of mushroom and some melted cheese, and a layer of puff pastry. It was tasty, but overpriced at $22. My husband's full-size mussels dish was $21 in comparison, which seemed much more reasonable. It was very odd my vegetarian dish cost more than his did, especially when he had seafood, which can be a little pricey. I gobbled up the pithivier and salad greens in no time, and helped myself to some of the fries that also came with my husband's order.
 
Maybe other dishes are more fairly priced, but the pithivier was the only meatless option that wasn't an appetizer/snack. As charming as the atmosphere was, we were underwhelmed by our first Toronto meal, and left feeling like we'd overpaid."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a spot to catch a soccer/football match at , have a few pints and enjoy some good pub food...this is the spot. The homemade ketchup is fantastic,. though they charge you for extras and they're very tiny portions! 

The sticky toffee pudding is one of the best I've had. We go here about twice or thrice a year to link up with friends but wish we went more often. Downstairs is a small room mainly for meals, during the summer there is a small patio. Upstairs is where all the action happens. There's quite a few stairs so be aware...no strollers or wheel chairs would be able to fit upstairs. 

On Sundays they will whip up an extravagant meal for small groups. You have to prebook this and I'm not fully sure of the menu but I believe they have roasts, turkeys and such, depending on the season. 

Service isn't the best but it isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Always enjoyable. Great beer selection (of course) and the menu is authentically British. Pub upstairs dining room downstairs. A little pricey for a pub but worth it. Close to Dundas station and Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this place. I have loved it for a long time because the food is outstanding and the vibe is great - classy and authentic. But the other day I stopped in for a quick drink and when I had paid the bill for my pretty ordinary, nothing-special Caesar, I was $15 lighter. Yes, FIFTEEN dollars for a glass of tomato juice and a shot of booze. This is a Caesar with no pickled beans, no fancy meat skewer, nothing. I was kind of gobsmacked. It's really put me off the place. Too bad..."}
{"text":"When I went here last night for my brother's birthday I had never heard of it before. I honestly thought it was sort of like a Firkin-ish type of establishment. I was very surprised by the atmosphere upon my arrival and even further intrigued as I perused the menu. It's all old English pub fare! It was really a nice change of pace and a learning experience.

I played it safe and ordered the fish and chips. It was delicious! The chips were particularly good and came w. a creamy dill dip and a fresh tomato dip as well (which I wasn't as fond of, the dill dip was divine though!). 

For dessert, my sister and I were both interested in finding out what canary steamed sponge was, so we got that to share. Honestly? I wished I'd gotten my own. It was THAT good. It was light and fluffy steamed lemon sponge cake with lemon curd cascading out of the top into a sea of velvety custard. It's served hot which makes it all the more satisfying. There was definite spoon-dueling going on for the last morsel of it! 

The drink prices aren't too bad either, my gin and tonic was only $6. 

If you're in the area, I would definitely say this place is worth a try! Make reservations if you can, because it was quite busy.

{"text":"On a recent weekend when the city was inundated with party people armed with a particular type of obnoxious energy, the Queen and Beaver was like a safe-house for three of us ladies who just wanted to grab some drinks in peace. Perhaps we had better been careful what we wished for though, 'cause it was empty save for one other table when we made ourselves comfortable on the rather quaint Queen and Beaver patio. 

We found this quite peculiar since the decor was properly prim and inviting, the service laid back, and the menu card concise. My beer was served cold and appropriately heady and if only I'd arrived before 11:00pm, I would've been able to sample some of the spectacular sounding British pub fare-inspired menu items. 

The comfy couches and multiple flat screens on the second floor look like it'd make a great place to cozy up with friends or even solo when the cooler weather hits. Maybe the good word will have spread by then and there'll be more bodies to warm up the place. I hope the food is as good as it sounds read when aloud from the chalkboard."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago, came here twice.  The space is really really cute, the drink menu and food both excellent, service very friendly!"}
{"text":"The Queen and Beaver is such a gem! It's the perfect little pub hidden on Elm Street. 

While I have had limited experience with the food served there, I've spent a few evenings in the football themed pub on the second floor. The service is great, and there is a good selection of beer. Watch out for the tequila though, it's $11/shot! 

The best thing about Queen and Beaver is the size - it's a bit of a smaller pub (but I've always been able to find a seat) which makes it great for a more relaxed night out. They also have a great little balcony, which always makes the smokers of the group happy! 

I've also heard from my male friends that there are tiny soccer balls and nets in the urinals, which was exciting for them (note: EW!) - but thought I'd pass the info along, in case you need another reason to check it out!"}
{"text":"A great property by the folks who brought us the Oxley and the Wickson, the Queen and Beaver is another demonstration of excellence in execution for the British gastro pub category.  You can never go wrong with the burgers.  They can even do a whole suckling pig with a little advanced notice!"}
{"text":"In a city overrun with exotic dining options, the Queen and Beaver on Elm Street offers a fancied-up take on Toronto's Anglocentric past. 

Dinner starts inauspiciously. House-baked bread is available, for $6. An increasingly common occurrance, it's developed into a pet peeve along with the practice of choosing side dishes a la carte, charging extra to substitute one menu item for another and the phenomenon of 'sharing plates'. I appreciate that you're running a business, but to me, this is the antithesis of 'hospitality'. A little goodwill goes a long way. The bread is excellent, but the expense leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 

Oxtail soup is rich red-brown, kitted out with healthy chunks of veg and slivers of tender meat. It's sweetness could come from slow cooking, or hooch, or just plain old sugar. It's all smoothness on the tongue. 

Fish and chips are an essential part of the pub experience. 
Q and B's fries illustrate the frites vs chips divide. I'm a frites man, myself. For me, the fun of fried food rests in the contrast between the salty crisp exterior and the creamy sweet interior. I prefer a high ratio of crunch to soft, so I'll take a golden plate of frites any day. Beer batter shatters upon fork/knife impact but the fish tastes a bit musty. 

It's not often that condiments require comment, but the tartar and cocktail sauces that arrive with my fish and chips deserve their own reviews. Tartar sauce is savoury; loaded with dill, capers and sharp dill pickle. It's a welcome change from the usual saccharine version. Homemade cocktail sauce is a revelation; chunky tomatoes and a near-subcontinental blend of spices cut through rich fish and potato. I blitz through my ramekin, and grab a tablemate's when she's not looking. 

A Gastropub (I know it's over, but how else to describe the Queen and Beaver) may not be your first choice for steak, especially with Barberians a few doors down, but the rib-eye is flavourful and cooked to a properly pink medium-well. Sided with more fries, it's a substantial supper.

Coffee is strong, if overly bitter. 

Desserts work best at the English comfort-food end of the spectrum. Warm sticky toffee pudding raises blood sugar from three tables away; indulgent golden sponge, dates and treacle are too good to share. Drowned in custard (or was that melted ice cream, my brain had stopped working after the third spoonful), it's a sense-memory in the making. More ambitious desserts, like an inexplicably-salty chocolate-orange tart, disappoint. 

Brunch is worthwhile, even if you pass on the hair of the dog. More of that strong coffee braces one for a proper English breakfast. Lightly scrambled eggs, rashers of bacon, sausage link, beans, tomato, mushroom and fried bread mean you don't have to eat for a week. It's all fresh; the eggs properly runny and the sausages popping with juice. 

A side of lemon ricotta pancakes gilds the lily-but wait-we asked for a side to share, but got a whole order instead. The mistake shows up on our bill, but the extra charge is removed with good humor. We feel better about the charged-for-bread incident a few nights earlier. 

I don't expect much when it comes to pubs in Toronto. My expectations are usually met. The Q and B may be too far downtown to be anybody's local, but on those rare occasions when you want to LARP an episode of Coronation Street, it'll do the trick."}
{"text":"I always suggest this place to friends who are being indecisive. The English-style pub has a great atmosphere. Their pub fare is fantastic. I've booked a couple of celebratory dinners here, including the Sunday Night Roast and Beef Wellington. They are a bit pricey and you have to book in advance, ($25-40/person), but it was delicious. The Beef Wellington they brought out was beautiful, and you could tell a lot of effort went in. However, our party of 10 would not have been filled if we hadn't ordered the appetizer platter too. The chef throws on an assortment of their menu, from calamari to scotch eggs to welch rabbits (cheesy toast, really good).   I'm a fan of the Black Catt stout, though they also have rotating cask selection for their beers. 

Service is very professional and friendly, though may be slow at times. The upstairs is a lounge area, though the wooden chairs may not be comfortable for all. The upstairs patio area is a nice and quiet from the downtown core though. Recommended!"}
{"text":"We started my friends Batcherolette party there last night and a great time was had by all. The waitress was fantastic  and personable.  She did an excellent job at describing the dishes with authority.  The food was spot on and delivered in a timely manner. The only thing from giving the experience a 5 was how hot the restaurant was. Other than that, I can't wait to go back for another experience.  Thanks for making this evening so memorable."}
{"text":"I've been on the hunt for the best Sunday roast dinner in Toronto, after trying a couple spots this is by far the best! Very tasty with good portions.

Decor is clean with nice atmosphere. Tucked off Yonge location is good. Service was perfect both times. 

Update: I've come to realize as good as the food and atmosphere is the customer service falls short. Staff could show appreciation for customers by sacrificing a minor inconvenience to them. Leaving the doors open on a breezy day is one example. If I wanted to sit outside I would. There's no need to have the doors wide open."}
{"text":"I came here a little while ago since a friend from school had recommended the burger here. It actually isn't a burger place, more like a comfortable English pub that just happens to serve up a tasty burger. I sat upstairs, right in front of the big screen as it showed some soccer. I would come back for just this alone. Oh, that and the men's urinal.

But the burger is very tasty. It comes with fresh cut fries and homemade ketchup, both of which are stellar. On the side they have pickled string beans or something. I wasn't a huge fan of that, but ate them anyway. The burger itself is very good. Thick, juicy patty, fresh toppings squished between a fresh bun. You can also specify how well done you want the beef to be, which tends to mean the beef is quality. I went with medium rare and they overcooked it slightly but it was still really good."}
{"text":"This spot is great if you're in Toronto and want to have some decent English food. The food was a bit overpriced, but the atmosphere was great. Our waiters really know their drink recommendations. 4 stars only because I believe you really should get more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"This is our first time here. We asked Siri for the best Sports Bar in Toronto and we were guided here. I have five things to say:
1. It's definitely not a Sports Bar. The Manager wants a \"den-like atmosphere\" so it was very difficult to get a football game on the giant tv upstairs in the \"den\". 2. We managed to get the game on but the Manager demanded that there be no sound (because of the desire to have a \"den-like atmosphere\" so we were forced to listen to terrible 70's Rock, yet as I looked around, everyone was watching the Cardinals beat the Packers....because this place is supposed to be a Sports Bar. 3. The fries were great and if you wanted non-crispy fish, then definitely order the fish and chips. 4. The Management is rigid and uncompromising. if you like that, then come here. 5. We will not be coming back. We saw the Manager deal with a customer in an unforgivable manner."}
{"text":"Allow me to revise.  Queen And Beaver is now a 5 for me.

After 10pm, it becomes really hard to find places still serving food around my area of Gerrard and Yonge.  And no, I'm not wasting a meal at Big Slice, especially when sober.

Luckily, The Queen And Beaver serves food until 11pm.

I had a Cider Duck Leg with Croquettes and String Beans in a Curry Sauce ($24) and it was excellent.  The curry sauce was delicious as was the duck leg (dark meat FTW) and its crispy skin (but not too dry).  Both the potato croquettes and string beans were great.

I tried a St. Abroise Cream Ale, which was decent.  They also carry Creemore, which is my Canadian favorite for beers.

Based on how tasty the food is here, it's really hard to imagine that the place is a pub.  It's in a class of its own, a classy pub.

The 3rd floor lounge bar area is a great hang out spot.  There's a TV and has an intimate living room feel.  Too bad they don't host Trivia Nights here.  It would be an ideal setting for it."}
{"text":"Good selection of interesting beers.  Upscale pub food reminiscent of a London pub.  Wait staff should learn to cheer up a bit.  My server was quick, efficient and accurate but was more than a little grumpy."}
{"text":"2 blocks south of the Queen & Beaver, I was a worried squirrel in a crappy jacuzzi of human bodies. 
Finding this cozy, bordering-on-upscale pub was the only thing about Dundas Square area I was thankful for. 

It's two floors of carpeted, gently lit rooms, but I go upstairs to the 'pub' level. Full of smushy chairs and warm worn wood, it's like I descend from British fox breeders and teach leather embossing part-time. *What a (Bas-)Relief!* 

They have a real British ale on tap that's nice and hoppy, ambery and a little stanky in the best sense. I'm told these are hard to come by outside of microbreweries in Ontario, so I appreciated it. A \"true ale\" they sale. I say, \"kind of weird but with a clean finish, like a Moomin drawing.\"

Their fish and chips are so good, it feels sinister. That was meal #1 

Meal #2: Stovies!!! I love stovies, and while I grew up with old ground beef and cruddy potatoes plus some water cooked slowly in a pan, this lamb and artichoke concoction was *almost* as comforting, though less amenable to squirting ketchup all over it. 

In short, a comforting pub. Worth the mini-splurge without doubt."}
{"text":"Sure, it had potential. And the ambience and fries were great. But that's where the fun ended.

Absolutely terrible customer service. The server hated that we were sharing our starters - it's a pub lady! Took away the starters angrily even before we were done. Then they forget our second order of fries for a long time. When my husband follows up, they land up with two orders of fries instead of one and argue that because we asked about it twice, we ordered two separate fries! She also seemed to be taking our drinks orders with multiple sour expressions which would have been funny if it wasn't rude. 

By then we were fed up and only the two most hungry people ordered mains. The rest of us decided to wait and go elsewhere because we were out to have a good time, and ill-tempered servers were not part of our good time. The server seemd mad that only two people out of six ordered mains. And since our reservation was at 6 p.m., why the absurd behaviour over the mains? For the mains - the lamb curry was decent. For the roast beef sandwich - they assumed that the person eating it wants it rare? Even when it's not mentioned on the menu that it's rare? My husband left all the meat - he dislikes rare meat - and ate only the bread. That's rather expensive bread at $18.

This place is too expensive for such pathetic service. I understand some of the food is good. But having such terrible snobbish attitude at an over-priced pub is not justified. There are a million expensive retaurants with great food and service in Toronto. I for one am never entering this one again."}
{"text":"Last night myself and two others came into an absolutely packed restaurant and immediately regretted not booking a reservation. Just before deciding to go somewhere else, the host offered to save us a table and put our names down. I was really impressed with the service overall here and totally appreciated the host being able to accommodate us. 

The food was especially delicious! I definitely recommend the duck leg with croquette and curry sauce. Such a satisfying dish... the croquette was nice and crispy on the outside, the curry sauce complemented the duck nicely, and the meat was tender and I could pull it right off the bone. For dessert, I chose to try their homemade salted caramel ice cream. It was the perfect finish to a lovely meal. 

Thank you so much for accommodating us! An absolutely wonderful meal. I recommend this place but MAKE RESERVATIONS!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: ++Proper gastropub FTW. Period. Beer, fries, football - what else do you need? Oh yeah, how about that stuffed beaver in the corner?

I've been coming here since it opened two years ago, and it continues being one of my favourite pubs to eat and drink at. Small patio, but if you can find a seat, go for it.

They have a stellar, albeit, limited selection of draft beers but they include my faves such as the McAuslan Cream Ale, Old Speckled Hen and Blanche de Chambly.

Their food, in a word, is HEARTY, and as such, rarely fails to disappoint. Their scotch egg, pear, stilton and walnut salad, and their mushroom pithivier ranks as some their top offerings. Their fish and chips and burger (apparently) are also killer. And don't' forget to get the side of fries, which are some of the best, especially when dipped in their house-made curried-infused catsup.

Recently attended an orphan Thanksgiving dinner / Jets season opener with 10-15 peeps (I was an honourary guest of what was otherwise a mob of Peggers). The place was extremely accommodating with the reservation and the game. Their turkey dinner was juicy with (?turkey) sausage, rich stuffing and fresh greens. Currently planning to attend their Sunday feasting dinner (for 5+ persons) for their wood roast suckling pig - manager says it's his favourite and I think it'd be silly to question that recommendation!"}
{"text":"Very nice pub! We've eaten here twice. The food is 4 stars. We had the fries with sea salt and it was heavenly. Most things on the menu are great. There's an upstairs patio. It's usually very quiet for lunch as the location is kinda hidden, but come for dinner and I'm sure it's busier. The prices are also steep so be ready to fork over $30-50 for two people. All in all, an excellent establishment near Yonge and Dundas."}
{"text":"I came for dinner tonight and had the sausages and mash. I was told the sausages are made in-house. They were tasty, juicy and grilled to perfection. You get two large sausages. The mashed potatoes were buttery and creamy. The gravy was rich and tasty. For dessert I had the sticky toffee pudding with salted caramel ice cream and it was amazing. The service was excellent as well. I would definitely reccomend this place and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've visited the place multiple times and have always had a great time, with friendly staff and pleasant atmosphere. However last time I cam with a group of friends for a few celebration drinks with a reservation and while we were waiting downstairs we were told we cannot wait at front and most go upstairs to wait for a table. 

The man who asked us to go upstairs was rude and unwelcoming, with apparently no please or sorry's in his vocab, and having to wait by the washroom area upstairs for our table to clear made it a very disappointing visit. We waited half an hour for our table until we decided the situation is pretty ridiculous and left to another place. It takes one bad experience to ruin it all. Perhaps the gentleman greeting visitors should rethink his attitude and approach."}
{"text":"This is a swanky little number hidden between Bay and Younge.  If you're in need of trying a different side of English cuisine or want a beer that you probably haven't tried, then this is your place.  The prices are more steep than you would pay at a traditional pub, but you get what you paid for.

Obviously the dish that stood out the most on the ploughman's platter was the lamb's tounge.  A scary as it may seem at first it's actually quite tasty and the drizzle on top complements it well.  It does not have the taste of what you would think making out with a lamb would be.  After the platter I had the sticky toffee pudding.  The cake was perfectly spongy, though a little dark on top, and was oozing with saucy goodness.

I think that once this place gets further established it will get that old boys club feel.  Definitely more classy than your average pub."}
{"text":"On a family vacation from Brooklyn, NY, we wanted to try a nice English Pub type of atmosphere. Everything we had was great. If you are visiting Toronto we highly recommend this place. Toronto is the \"English\" city, Montreal is the \"French\". 

We have a lot of Irish pubs in NYC, but not English. I feel this was an excellent representation. Wonderful atmosphere and great food and drink...Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Great food and drink. Pints are a bit expensive, but the lines are clean and service is great."}
{"text":"Interior decor is splendid. Went upstairs for brunch and chose to sit indoors, where it was calm (and away from the heat).

Ordered the Hand-Chopped Burger and the Egg Benedicts. In terms of presentation, both did not disappoint. 

However, the burger was the size of my (relatively small) fist. In other words, it seemed as though it belonged to a children's menu, definitely not filling enough for an adult. While the pieces of meat in the patty were interesting, would not order again for 20$. On the bright side, the fries stood out because they were softer and it seems that sea salt was used- TLDR; fries were 10/10. 

Eggs were lovely. But beyond perfection, nothing stood out (aside from the scone). It felt rather dull which was a slight let down. Was surprised that there was nothing on the side. 

Would not recommend the burger- not particularly good. Eggs, would recommend with warning that it is \"traditional,\" in the sense that it has no additional \"frills.\""}
{"text":"Pre dinner drink at The Queen And Beaver was so enjoyable!! 

Sitting on the over sized sofa, drinking a beer and watching the Leafs sure made me feel like home! 

The lounge area is so cozy and inviting... once I sank into the cushiony sofa, I don't want to get up!! I just want to stay here and drink my beer, watch the game and ask the friendly waiter to feed me!! 

I definitely will be back again and again and again! And of course next time will be more than just drinking!"}
{"text":"Rest assured my rating is strictly for the food, since that is most important to me and also because I ran out of stars to subtract for other mistakes in the service/atmosphere. 

Keeping this story as brief as I can...

We made reservations for 10 for my friend's birthday based on the great yelp reviews and proximity to her work. We were seated in a little nook in the back next to the kitchen where half our table was forced to wear jackets because of the back door being opened/closed for employee smoke breaks - don't forget the accompanying stench of tobacco to boot. (You have a big group where you can expect a large bill and you give them the worst seats in the house?!) Okay. Sure. Moving on. 

Next up, drinks. I had whichever beer was on rotation - an IPA, and the boyfriend had the stout. Both were basic beers- mildly flavoured water. Neither were anything special. My birthday-friend had a dark and stormy, it tasted like the type you get at a cheap place, too much ice that ended up really watering down the drink and the rum was unnoticeable. No one had praise for their own selections. 

Okay how about some good 'ol high-end British pub food to wash down that beer? Snack time! I LOVE pork scratching. These were not pork scratchings. I'm pretty sure it was charcoal with a good helping of unrendered fat. (How they managed to burn these with some pieces not cooked is one of the biggest marvels of the night, broken tooth jokes were aplenty.) I had originally wanted a sausage roll but they were sold out. Okay, how about the Scotch eggs? Out-of-the-fridge cold with an overcooked egg. The fish croquettes were the best... but neither memorable or repeatable.

This was the worst dinner I have had in a while and we hadn't even received the entrees. Let the shit-storm continue!

My birthday-friend and another ordered the steak: one asked for rare, the other medium. However they both received medium. I had a bite.. Very dry, under seasoned, under seared, and not a very good cut of meat to begin with.  I kept prompting her to send it back but she didn't want to waste food. 

I had the Peppered Beef and Stilton Pudding. The meat was actually nice. The roasted veggies also delicious! They managed to not fuck up BRAISING & ROASTING. Congrats guys, you passed day 1 of chef school. However the crust was RAW (somebody needs to get Ramsey in here) The gravy was good and actually greatly improved the Hand Chopped Burger that the boyfriend had. He requested it med-rare and it was also served medium,  more annoyingly the bun was stale.(#&%$ SERIOUSLY.) Hence the gravy was used as a dip. Maybe they should serve it like that. 

Another at the table ordered the Welsh Rabbit since he grew up eating them, after he couldn't stomach it everyone had a bite and it actually became the joke of the table (replacing the scratching! I didn't think it was possible to top that!). 

We all shared a laugh at the $10 for milk and cookies, are they made of gold? 

The place does look very nice, especially on a cold night. I made sure the boys went to the bathroom to see the urinals. The service was... Well, we had a larger group than anticipated since it was a birthday party and people decided to \"surprise\" my friend. They weren't allowed to pull up a chair and ended up having to sit at the bar. There was physical room at the table, we started squishing the chairs together but were stopped by the manager(? I'm assuming since he wasn't our server) He let us know after dinner we could all sit together upstairs for drinks. That's nice, I guess, it was our fault anyways. I wish they could have been more accommodating. However upstairs never happened since dinner took over an hour, and no one even wanted another drink here with the lack of good options.

Otherwise service was okay, not friendly, not distant; the water was refilled often enough. I never had a chance to complain about my food as the plates weren't cleared until we had paid & were putting on coats. I really didn't know where to start either. \"How was everything?\" \"Absolutely British! You guys really know how to live up to the stereotype of terrible food!\" \"Oh, thank you, it's quite hard to do something this bad, and charge you this much! We threw in the cold breeze and split up your party just to guarantee your friend a bad birthday dinner.\""}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for a few years now - yes, you read right - a few years. A colleague of mine had described it as 'one of the best english pubs in the city'.

We went at about 6 pm on a Sunday and we're seated right away at a nice table. The waiter was extremely polite and helpful and the service was excellent! 

The order: I got the roast dinner which had the roast cooked perfectly, so tender and well seasoned. It came with a delicious Yorkshire pudding, roasted veggies (green beans, carrots, beats, parsnips and potatoes) all doused in a delicious gravy ($28). My wife had the fish and chips - it was one large piece of haddock with a bowl of chips that were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The haddock was well seasoned and had a really nice crunch to the batter. It came with tartar sauce and a really interesting and fun tasting house ketchup with caraway seeds. There was the Heinz ketchup and malt vinegar as well. ($19)

The mains were both DELICIOUS and I don't think I could pick a favourite. 

We were just about to leave when I remembered some other Yelpers talking about the sticky toffee pudding. Oooooooh yes yes yes yes. It was so rich and warm paired with a scoop of in house made ice cream. Oh god it was good. We shared this - I recommended sharing this one as it is quite rich. 

They didn't have Guinness but offered a junction brewery stout that my wife said tasted like Guinness with espresso (in a good way). 

Overall.... great service with an excellent meal. Never change Queen and Beaver. We're coming back! 

Total bill taxes in $71.76 plus tip."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great location on Elm street, feels like real English pub. The lamb shoulders are fantastic. Really nice staff."}
{"text":"I love this little British restaurant located right off the main drag. You can get bangers and mash, true fish n chips, shepherds pie, lamb roast with pudding and other British dishes. You will walk in and immediately love this place."}
{"text":"Pubby (that's an adjective, right?), but not grubby.  The Queen and Beaver?  Let's be friends.

'tis the season for patios, and I enjoy the one here.  Though it's not far from the T.O. crowds geographically, you wouldn't know that you're in the heart of things as you sit on either the main floor or second floor patio (I prefer the latter to be at tree-line).  

The comfortable space itself is beautifully redone with never-ending nods to Mother England.  

The menu will also please anglophiles, with appetizers like scotch eggs, chips (we're talking the thick British kind) with curried ketchup, and welsh rarebit.  

I've enjoyed brunch here - deviled eggs, cock-a-leekie soup, haddock kedgeree - but my favourite time to visit The Queen and Beaver Public House is late-night.  Hand chopped burgers are deliciously juicy, and the sardines with tomatoes on toast will have even the skeptical asking you for a bite.

An extra star goes specifically to the bar menu: there is a great curated selection of beer and cider on offer (Canadian and UK-originating), and cocktails like Pimms and lemonade and the pink grapefruit-based greyhounds are personal favourites in the summer.  In conclusion...

...rule Britannia!

Yelp note: trust the people behind The Queen and Beaver, despite yourself: tongue, rabbit, treacle and black pudding might all feel adventurous, but your tastebuds will thank you for taking the culinary risk."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my visit here. The spiced kale salad is extraordinary. 

Portions on my pork sausage entree were smaller than expected, but my girlfriend loved her NY strip steak.

Beer selection was also very good as advertised. I also had the maple syrup old fashioned cocktail, which wasn't really all that special - but cost more than any other cocktail. 

Dessert was great as well - had the caramel ice cream which was just as good as you might hope. 

Finally the service was great as well, friendly and no problems whatsoever."}
{"text":"I returned and for brunch no less. Their full english breakfast is stellar and complete with beans, sausage, bacon, eggs your way, and something called fried bread. Avoid this bread lest you prefer your toast predipped in vegetable oil. Everything else was as the British say, \"smashing.\"

I've also had their Moroccan spiced lamb sandwich. At $17 it's pricy, but definitely delicious. I can smell the spices now. I really shouldn't write these things when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to watch playoff hockey, I was drawn here because I loved the name, and it was listed as a \"sports bar\".  I think sports bar is a stretch, as there was one huge television in the upper lounge, but since the bartenders were accommodating and put on the game, we ate dinner there on a large couch in front of the one screen.

The two bartenders working when we arrived were incredibly fun and personable.  Plus, they made a mean cocktail, including a clever, delicious one called Old Fascist - their take on the Old Fashion.

I had the haddock and chips for my meal, and it was decent. Generous portion of fish served with a flavorful tartar sauce, although I wish the chips (French fries) weren't just a collection of bits and pieces at the bottom of the cup.

The clear winner here was the dessert of sticky, toffee pudding.  Not much to look at, but the flavors were incredible, including a strong bite of molasses, and I yummed my way through the entire dish.  

Prices are a bit high, but the comfortable lounge, the innovative drinks, and the upbeat attitude of the bartenders makes this a place worth hanging out."}
{"text":"Generally speaking I think English food ought to stay in England.  Bangers and mash, bubble and squeak, black pudding, marmite...  c'mon people.  But  tut tut, our dinner at Queen and Beaver could hold a candle to any place in downtown Toronto serving fine food.  Checked first if the Fuller's London Pride on draught (not draft) was served cold, and it was.  A hoppy, amber, yummy ale with caramel overtones.  We decided to forgo apps in anticipation of the sticky toffee pudding.  Everyone raved about their main, from the pickerel in a curry sauce, to the tarragon chicken, to my marrow crusted veal strip loin with braised potherbs (a sprig of thyme over some wilted dandelion greens, I think, perfectly cooked and resting on a swish of mashed salsify or possibly parsnip and jus.  The marrow wasn't obvious, but I think it added crispness to the panko crust.  A smallish portion for $26, and the sides (brussel sprouts in bacon, e.g.) were extra. Finally the moment we came for--the pudding course.  In Britain all desserts are called pudding even if they aren't.  The dark chocolate brownie with cinder toffee proved warm and rich, the sticky toffee pud with vanilla ice cream was heaven on earth, and my stilton and wild cherry scoop of ice cream was rustic with occasional salty chunks of cheese...unusual and quite delicious.  Service lovely throughout with ready explanations of the dishes we had never heard of before (but weren't quite ready to try).   We had a lovely table with no wait even without a reservation around 8pm and would happily return."}
{"text":"Love this place. Beautiful space, with a cozy upstairs with comfy chairs and a big TV, also a lovely patio on the upper level. Servers and bartenders are friendly. Food is good, if not amazing. Beers however are of course on point!"}
{"text":"I'm hovering between 3 and 4 stars for this one.  

I've come here twice, and the first time I got here I found that the service was slow and they didn't come by very often.  It took 40 minutes to get a plate of fries!  Now unless they were digging potatoes out from the ground and hand cutting them, that's crazy!  

Love the decor - very classy, and the patio on the roof is pretty awesome.  The food, while somewhat pricey for a pub ($9 for a toast, entrees are around $17-$30), is delicious and I like the incorporation of local fare.  

When you do get the staff coming to you, they can be nice.  One server I had was a bit sharp with customers, but perhaps she was having a bad day.  

Side note: could do without the trendy-cum-trying-to-be-posh descriptions of food i.e. \"Urchfont Remoulade\" = tartar sauce.  Stop passing it off at something else!!"}
{"text":"I had the smoked pheasant and ham hock terrine and it was amazing. It was so moist and perfectly done. The soup was equally as good. So impressed--can't wait to go back for brunch!"}
{"text":"I would Probably give this a 5 star if we had been able to sit back and relax. But we were on our way to the airport and had limited time. The upstairs patio was pretty busy, but our waitress put our order on a rush and we had it within 10 minutes. My wife and I split a salad and fish and chips. They were both very good. Unfortunately, we had to fly so we couldn't have dessert but it sure looked interesting."}
{"text":"This place had a really good vibe. I really liked a lot of things about it. Though, you will be paying an arm and a leg for an omelette. The ambiance was very nice and the chairs were incredibly comfortable.

The food was interesting and they definitely take it to a new level of French Canadian with a twist. The food was fresh and delicious. Though, the one thing I did not like was the service. Our server was absent minded and didn't offer cream for my coffee. I had to wait 10 minutes, when my coffee became cold before he brought the cream. It was definitely bad experience. As well as, at the end, he didn't remember who paid for what, he mixed the drinks on the bill and he didn't bring the card machine when we mentioned that we were paying with cards.

At an establishment who was offering such a high level of value and quality, they definitely missed with the service."}
{"text":"[Feasting Menu] 

I have been to The Queen and Beaver Public House (@QueenBeaverPub) a couple of times now (see old post here) and this time around, there was 12 of us this time so we decided to try out their Feasting menu (see their menu here, contact them for details since menu may varies).

Innis & Gunn Scotch Barrel Aged 13oz (Scotland) $8.95
McAuslan Cream Ale (Quebec) $7.25
Durham Brewery Black Katt Stout (Ontario) $7.25

Venison Cobbler w/ Cheddar Scones   +   Roast Bison

~ We order 6 portion each at $360 total ($30pp), both are from their feasting menu with a minimum of 5-6 order per dish.

~ This Venison Cobbler was hearty and delicious but totally wish it came with some sort of carb or bread to mop the sauce.

~ The roast bison was perfectly cook, I was expecting something dryer but it was moist and quite fatty with a red center. I'll have to say that this is a rather small portion, this was suppose to serve 6 people which mean 1/2 portion each for the 12 of us. We each got a slice each, even with full portion which is 2 slice I doubt any of us will be entirely full.

~ The feast only came with a side of roasted veggies which I thought was rather limited. For a table of 12, I was hopping for more than one choice of side.

Sticky Toffee Pudding & Vanilla Ice Cream $8
~ You know I can't resist the ooyee gooyee goodness of STP, this was the perfect traditional tasting dessert.

Verdict :
~ Great company, great hearty meal & great service.
~ With a big table, all our order was spot on, our water was filled on time...
~ The feasting menu was definitely tasty but very reasonable priced as well."}
{"text":"What a treat!  My wife & I came in specifically for the full English breakfast.  We opted to sit upstairs where the footie game was being shown.
I was not disappointed in the least.  The portion looked a bit small when it arrived, but when the meal was done I was more than satisfied.  Eggs over easy, perfectly done; highly seasoned sage sausages were good and tasted perfect with the sauteed mushrooms; roasted tomato was a perfect compliment to the bacon; the black pudding was by far the best I've tasted in a very, very long time.  I topped my brekkie off with a cup of English breakfast tea.
Service was excellent.  Lewis was polite and popped over occasionally to check in on us.  He discussed English bitters with us even giving us a sample to taste test.
Don't walk by without giving this place a visit.  For great food, awesome friendly service, and a real English vibe (at least there was upstairs) you can't go. wrong."}
{"text":"Pub food.  I've heard more than once to not set the bar high.

I'll still eat at almost any pub, hoping to find a gem spot for foodies (and veggie types).

Recently tried Q & B.  Actually good.  Prices were higher than what they could be.  A main entree around $10-14 would have been nice.
I paid $16. for my vegetarian Pithivier (veg pie, with some cheese), and my companion enjoyed Harissa Bangers (beef? sausages; $17).

We sat indoors, right outside the kitchen, which turned out to be a no-no.  It was warm, very warm.  So warm that the only two tables, joined, filled with very young 20 somethings maybe about to next head out for a night of dancing, commented more than once on the mistake of sitting near the kitchen (oven).  And asked the server about the heat, in case anything could be done.

I'm glad the entrees were enjoyable.  I'd rather pay more than I would have wanted, for something that I enjoyed, than for something that I'd shake my head and regret ordering.

Service was good.  Nice.  I was even encouraged to come back with my little one again.  
Indoor space wasn't conducive to bringing a stroller in, but a carrier worked fine.
Noise level was not screaming loud, but loud enough to camouflage my baby's random vocalizations.  

-Would I come back?  Yes.  Food was tasty;
-Veg-friendly?  Technically yes, they offered the one veg dish.  I really really hope they offer more veg dishes in the future.  *not sure what kind of shortening was used in the Pithivier pie, however.  It was the only veg dish the server could offer to me.  The bulk of meal choices there, revolve around different types of meat;
-kid-friendly?  Yes.  Esp. the Sunday or weekend brunches, I hear;
-Next time on a warm summer night: Sit outdoors on the patio.  They have one on the main level, and another upstairs.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

star-worthy -- good tasting food, decent service, good noise level for people there with babies/kids;
to be better -- please, offer more veg choices."}
{"text":"The Queen and Beaver is an English pub. It looks more like a well-decorated living room than a pub. Then again, I haven't been to very many pubs. But it doesn't matter. This place is classy and quaint, and has pretty decent food and wonderful service. 

I came for lunch with three co-workers last Tuesday, and the first floor was packed. Thankfully, we had a reservation and were seated right away. Our server was quick to come by to fill our glasses and to explain the menu and specials to us. I ordered the wild mushroom pithivier -- puff pastry with scalloped potatoes and mushrooms in between. Three of my favorite things! It tasted really rich and delicious, but was a little too greasy. But it came with a side salad so I told myself that it all balanced out. One of my co-workers ordered the lamb curry (which he has eaten here before) but ended up having to get something else because it was too spicy. Our server was really friendly and apologetic about it, and took it off our bill, which I thought was nice. I'd give the food 3.5 stars and 4 stars for the service and ambience. Not sure if I would be back just because I'm not a huge fan of pub food and I think it's a little expensive, but this is definitely a good option for a business casual lunch!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Atmosphere!  Great food.  Shepherds pie was amazing!   I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time last night - and loved it.

My friend and I agreed that we haven't had such amazing pot pie since our respective travels to the UK! And no wonder: Q&B's chef is a Brit. :)

We had the guinea fowl and wild mushroom pot pie (from the starters section of the menu) - and it was deeelish! Super soft flaky pastry on top/outside, and the inside was filled with flavourful sauce (almost like a soup) and succulent meat and veg.

I also tried the asparagus soup - and it was the best I've ever had. Super creamy and tasty - served with a lovely slice of bread.

The atmosphere is vibrant - a classy, charming and casual place that is in a two-level building, with rustic decor - love the solid wood furniture. The air is warm and inviting. Service follows suit. They accommodate groups of all sizes.

If you're ever craving English pub fare - this is the place to go!

Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I ended up at The Queen and Beaver looking for a spot to catch the France-Iceland soccer match on Pride day. It's a very cool, very British pub, lots of British memorabilia, menu, staff and customers. I did not try the food, my boyfriend and I only had a couple of beers (London Pride and other local options), they also have a cask option. 
We went upstairs where they had a bar/lounge with couches and different sized tables, as well as a big screen TV. The patio upstairs seemed nice. Downstairs it had more of a restaurant vibe. 
Overall lots of character, good beer, good service, really cool place."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim (based on Yelp search of nearest bar with good reviews) and was very impressed. It's a more \"classy casual\" pub than a run of the mill pub (I mean, picture of the Queen!) but the vibe is still casual. We said we were doing drinks so the hostess directed us upstairs where the seating was more like a dark, cozy coffee shop. My friends and I sat at the bar though bcos no 3-seater for us. The bartender was super nice and attentive he literally never let my water glass empty ever. I ordered the mussel on toast...not gonna lie just saw \"mussel\" and because we were in a pub I assumed it will be steamed mussel in broth. But when it came on toast I re read the menu again lol either way it was SO GOOD. Like what!? Mussles. On. Toast. Ppl: how is this so good? It's because of the pickled veggies on top and the sauce. I would totally eat this again and go here to try more food and drinks! (Didn't drink alcohol because it's Monday...) also the burger has no description on menu but make sure you ask your server to describe it because although I currently don't remember what it was, as he was describing what's in it, I got more and more intrigued and asked why didn't they just put that on the menu because that sounds amazing!"}
{"text":"There are often moments in life where I desire both comfort food and fine fare, and The Queen and Beaver knows how to do both of these things correctly and simultaneously. She's a beaut!

The food is really excellent, and is paired nicely with their fun little cocktail list and huge tap list. 

I enjoyed the cider mussels and the old cheddar toast. Simple, but obviously made with care and quality ingredients. I paired these winners with a pimms cup. Who doesn't love a well balanced pimms cup!?

They have two lovely patios for summer, and great cozy couches and fireplace-lined rooms for the winter.

It is a bit too pricey sometimes, and the servers can be a tad snarky, so it's not quite a 5 star joint, but it's definitely the jewel of Elm St."}
{"text":"Elegantly decorated, this pub has an interesting menu with dishes uncommonly found in English pubs like rabbit pot pie, bison short ribs, mushroom pithiviers (fancy French style pie), bangers and mash with Middle-Eastern sausages. Needless to say, that's exactly what intrigued me!!! 

I heard that its burger is one of the best in town, but I ordered the bangers and mash... It was good, but the sausages were rather dry and the mash.... Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was just powder. For that I dont think it's worth the money, especially given that the food is overall pricey.

However I will return to try something else, hopefully this time on a patio given that they are highly rated!!!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic find! Service is friendly and the beer selection is deep with local selections.  Start with the butternut squash dumplings -- get an order to go because one will jut leave you wanting more.  Then, it's on to the duck, which is spectacular.  

This is a great place."}
{"text":"I am not much of review writer, however I feel the need to share this. We went for Saturday brunch with some friends yesterday. The ambiance is nice and rustic. I tried full English; very average but ok.
It took a bit long to get the food, however considering 15 people in our party; wasn't that bad. 
The big disappointment was unfriendly unwelcoming server named Kelsey! She sarcastically told a couple of my friend: \"to stop playing musical seats\" when they changed their seats. We understand that a server assigns number to each guest to take order and to separately bill them. But there is no need to be rude about it and to show attitude! Probably She was sure that she will get 18% gratuity on large party and did not try to be nice about anything. Non of us will go back there again."}
{"text":"Queen and Beaver
Its an English pub in the 'gastro kitchen and cask ale' ilk. The building retains the sensibilities of a 17th century English terraced house, with the main restaurant on the main floor. The building even retains the slightly uneven floors and creaking staircases etc, but fosters a calm and relaxing drawing room to enjoy a meal with a good locally produced cask ale in your own time. Slowly. There's an upstairs bar and patio that's an extension of the casual bar. The casual bar is still English country pub in style. No AC. 

The food and beers were well thought through, a little over complicated and unnecessarily  so when it came to the deep fried rabbit with a marmalade dipping sauce from what I remember. Main courses were excellent, lots of rich flavors and sauces to enjoy. Sticky toffee pudding was exactly the right consistency, eased down with custard and a nut brown ale. 

As with many restaurants and bars in Toronto, the prices would make an NYC restauranteur blush, but that's the going rate in a vibrant growing and modern city."}
{"text":"This was a great find!  

Looking for a good lunch place with good pub fair is easy enough but this place was much more!  The food was wonderful, the atmosphere was perfect, and the service was excellent.  This was a five star experience.  

My wife and I sat in the lower pub along the front windows. It was a nice view of the street and pleasantly after any lunch rush. The brunch menu and normal pub menu were simple but delicious, and the daily specials were a great mix, from venison cobbler to oxtail soup.  

Liz had the later, which I tried to my enjoyment. The rich oxtail clearly cooked down to its delicious and rich best. The marrow and meat blended to make a hardy stock with incredible flavor. Roasted with tomatoes and other veggies gave it a delicious flavor. Liz had aged cheddar and tomato grilled sandwich, and was quite pleased. 

For my meal I enjoyed the hamburger I saw on the yelp pictures. It was infinitely better than I expected it would be. Instead of a hamburger, it was hand chopped beef made into a burger with delicious bacon and stilton cheese with a tomato terrine.  It was incredible. Cooked medium rare, the fresh cut beef bits with all the good bits of fat and whole meat was incredible. The toasted bun and some of the most delicious French fries I've had finished the meal. 

It's worth mentioning that the service was stellar. We weren't rushed and our waitress made wonderful suggestions. She found some delicious hot mustard for the fries and was perfectly pleasant. 

This place was not just great pub fare, but exceptional food!"}
