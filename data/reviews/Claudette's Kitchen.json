{"text":"Phenomenal food made by good people. Bourbon chicken is the best I've ever eaten. The Knuckle burger is delicious. Please give this place a try. People are afraid of New Kensington but the food and coffee venues are great. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"This review is for the Kiski Plaza location: This was my first time here  We had the Steak Philly - nicely seasoned and served Philadelphia style. Shrimp and grits - a bit bland. Could use some seasoning.  Fried mushrooms - typical bar food caliber you can get anywhere. Very interesting and extensive menu. Will definitely try more stuff in the future."}
{"text":"Their menu is very diverse. Soul food, Caribbean, Italian, etc. They have all you can eat crab legs on Friday's. I'm a regular there. Only critique is they don't have a credit card machine yet but they're new, so it's only a matter of time before that changes. Last time I was there I ate a fried crab sandwich. It was unique. I respect originality."}
