{"text":"Outstanding smoothie. The young kids working there have finally started getting more relaxed in a good way. In the beginning it was hectic because they were learning the menu, cash register, etc... The place is spotless, they are constantly cleaning the place and wiping down the counters."}
{"text":"Just ordered a Thai Chicken salad to go got it back to my office open it up and major disappointment!! 3 pcs if chicken, wilted slimy lettuce all throughout no cilantro as promised in the menu description...what a major bummer! Guess my lesson has been learned, only order smoothies from here. If you can't do it right...don't do it at all!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch here today. We got a buffalo chicken wrap which was not very good and smoothies. There were two people sitting at the bar that seemed to be friends with one of the workers. They were not eating or drinking anything and the girl continued to braid and do her hair while I ate my lunch. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the smoothies were so delicious! The person who waited on us was, I think, the owner. He was very friendly and thanked us several times for coming in. I would definitely come back to this location. The smoothies are of excellent quality and are super thick...not watered down as they can be at other places. I highly recommend Tropical Smoothie Cafe for smoothies! Be aware, however, they are extremely addictive! I predict you will find yourself craving them and wanting to go back for more!!!"}
{"text":"So I broke my jaw racing motocross so I'm pretty limited to what I can \"eat\" since my jaw is wired shut. The guy rich makes me feel good and his customer service is 10 out of 10. As a local business owner having rich on the team is deff an asset! Give that man a raise!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! What would've earned a five star would be if employee Mr. Savion (dark hair with glasses) had a better attitude while what looked like training a new employee. He was very rude to her and it was more than noticeable. At times it even made my husband and I feel the urge to speak up for her. While making smoothies he would loudly slam things shut, and when he delivered our food he just tossed my husbands food on the table! However, I will say the smoothie and food were both great. Please train your employees to treat others including customers and fellow employees with respect! It goes a long way."}
{"text":"Just bad. Ordered a smoothie that DID NOT have any mix-ins like protein powder or anything. Realized after driving away and heading back to work that either they gave me the completely wrong smoothie or they took it upon themselves to mix crap in it I didn't want. The entire thing smelled and tasted like straight vitamins! I couldn't even drink it! Even my son who drinks meal replacement drinks and protein shakes said it was awful! Wasted money - never again...."}
{"text":"Orange, pineapple, mango and other ingredients make this a tasty and refreshing smoothie for this hot Arizona day."}
{"text":"I work right next door and that's probably one reason I go here pretty often. However, I have found myself coming here even on my days off. (I forgot to mention I also live within a mile of this place) I personally love the sunrise sunset! I have never had a bad experience with the employees working here but I can agree that some are a little shy and have a harder time making light conversation. However, they have always greeted me coming in and thanked me for coming in. The owner has been working numerous times when I've come in and he is super nice and even remembers my name which I appreciate."}
{"text":"After a morning of fishing....wanted something refreshing and tasty. Place was alright....overpriced or well, pretty expensive for a fruit smoothy or protein smoothy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've always had excellent customer service, and the food is amazing! I went for a smoothie, but saw their food menu and had to try that instead. Excellent smoothies, amazing food, great casual atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great smoothies! They are gigantic and delicious. The service is fast and friendly. Love having this shop in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that when I was there, the place was staffed by teenagers and one angry grown man. I watched a woman wait for a smoothie, one smoothie, for about 15 minutes before she got up and asked about her smoothie status. She was already waiting when we came in so I don't know how long she was waiting before that. What I do know is that when she talked to the cashier he put on a blank face and looked around. Someone else asked him if she ordered a Beach Blast or something like that. He then looked at her and asked if she ordered a Beach Blast. She said yes. Then the other employee said to the cashier it's in the fridge. \"The ffridge?\" the befuddled cashier inquired. With a deep sigh the other employee walked over to \"the fridge\" and pulled out \"the smoothie\".  She handed it to the cashier. The cashier handed it to the customer. The customer asked why they didn't call her name and she cashier shrugged and said, we lost the tag. When the customer asked how long it had been sitting there the answer was another shrug. Not a single apology was to had today my friend. I'd ordered a banana smoothie. \"Just banana?\" I was asked? \"Yep!\" was my enthusiastic answer. \"No sugar?\" was the next puzzled question. \"Well, yes, sugar, whatever you normally do like strawberry banana but no strawberry.\" When I got my smoothie it was only full 2/3rds of the way. I must have had a funny look on my face because the girl that handed it to me said it's short because there's no strawberry. Which makes no sense because it isn't like they shorted what they asked me to pay them. But rather than argue with kids I headed out the door.  I will say, delicious smoothie. Maybe once they get their act together I will go back but for now, I'm all set with paying full price for 2/3rds of a smoothie no matter how yummy it is."}
{"text":"Went here to get a smoothie and a sandwich for lunch. When I walked in the girl behind the counter was cleaning something in the gutter on the floor. She came over to help me in a couple mins without washing her hands. After taking my order she started to prepare the smoothie without washing her hands. I immediately asked for the manager and he didn't seem concerned at all he just asked her to wash her hands. He was not apologetic at all he just went back to what he was doing. This place lost my business!"}
{"text":"Smoothies and the new Caribbean Jerk wrap were amazing!! I was greeted by all 3 crew members that were working. Hannah the girl who rang me up was very helpful with suggestions!"}
{"text":"Completely obsessed with this place. I have been coming here since they opened a few months ago. The HUGE size of smoothie for the price is ridiculous. The same smoothie from any other smoothie place would be twice the cost so these are a real deal! I use the app every time which allows you to order ahead, customize and pay just like the Starbucks app and then you earn points for free food. I usually get the Detox which is a little earthy but low calorie and healthy or the Acai Blueberry Max that makes my body soooooooo happy and is literally filling and nutritional enough to be my dinner many evenings. Sandwiches are pretty good but salads are quite small. But in the big picture, Great concept smoothie business!"}
{"text":"I have been to other tropical smoothies and received far better service than this location. After accidentally placing the wrong order, a worker named Savion seemed clearly inconvenienced by what I had done, after I had continually apologized for ordering wrong. He was frustrated and rude to me, and after that an elderly woman ordered and him and his teenage coworkers were smirking and laughing as she was slowly trying to figure out what she wanted. Crazy how immature the workers were, will not be returning to this one."}
{"text":"Bomb smoothies, excellent price, not the best service. Usually when I walk in, the girls behind the counter are talking to each other and won't pause to even say hello, will actually make you wait till they are done with their convo to serve you. I usually wouldn't continue to go back to a place with service like this but they make excellent smoothies so I overlook it (here though, 1 less star) ...  I love the açaí berry, avocalada, and bahama mama, top three all day!   Make sure to use their app for all purchases to get your reward!"}
{"text":"My family comes here multiple times for smoothies.  Each time we are treated courteously and promptly. The smoothies always tastes the same. In my book, that's reliable and good customer service.  I'm not that into smoothies personally, but it makes everyone else happy."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I LOVE this place. Service is always good and the food & smoothies are AMAZING. This is an awesome healthy option for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"One star because there was no wait time. Stopped by this location a few weeks ago. No greeting when we went in. Guy ( dark hair/glasses) spoke not a word to us with the exception of asking for our order. Gave us the impression we were bothering him... Worst customer service in a long time."}
{"text":"I didn't have a great experience here today. I order a smoothie through the app and when I came to pick it up it was ready but the girls behind the counter never greeted me and had me stand at the counter until they finished laughing and talking. I purchased cookies in the store and once Isabella rung me up, she flung the cc auth down told me to sign and walked away. There was no \"thank you, \"have a nice day\" nothing. I guess my business doesn't matter here. I won't be back."}
{"text":"One of the smoothie's I had was the best smoothie ever.......peanut butter something.    Next time I'll buy 5.   But not sure if will go to this location.  Customer service was terrible.  Two young girls working. No other customers in the small restaurant.   And after entering they didn't say hello and did not look up from assembling spoons, forks, etc.   finally one walked over to me, never smiled or said hi.   Then she repeated my order and got one item wrong.  Two smoothies and she was so out of it with no other customers, she can't get it right?   Then she handed both items to me and didn't say thank you.  I said thank you 3 times.     It's a different generation I guess.    Even though both smoothies were great, bad customer service always leaves a sour taste in your mouth.   ,"}
{"text":"Very watered down smoothies... super disappointed for $6. I've been to other tropical smoothies and they aren't usually like this. Lame sauce,"}
{"text":"Horrible service, the cashier who was a young girl didn't even say a single word to me the entire time. Not a smile or anything remotely friendly... just looked as if she was extremely pissed off the entire time, sucks she had such bad attitude because I love tipping especially during the holidays but she got nothing from me lol. Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"Came in here today after yelping smoothie places near me because I usually will drive down to the Chop Shop to get my protein and smoothie fix but figured I'd look and try something closer to my work. The place has a nice clean modern look and the staff are very friendly and when I mentioned it was my first time here they took the time to explain how the menu worked and point out details about the smoothies for me which I appreciated. I ordered the peanut paradise and the southwest breakfast wrap. The price for both was usually what I pay for just a smoothie at Chop Shop so I was pleased and even more pleased when I received a full burrito and huge serving of my smoothie. The manager was in the store and made sure I was satisfied and brought me some hot sauce. Overall I think I've found my new smoothie joint for lunch! Will be back again soon!"}
