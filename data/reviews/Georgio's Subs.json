{"text":"Went there this past week and got a meatball sub for my husband and myself. The owner was very friendly but we were not happy at all with the subs.   Subway meatball subs are better. Could have made better ones myself at home"}
{"text":"Business just opened not too long ago, thought I'd try it.  Got a specialty sandwich DOWNTOWN DIP(Signature Sub) beef strips, cheddar, horseraddish & Au Jus on sourdough.  When I got it, there was no Au Jus and no strips of beef, what I got was a tiny bit of minced meat and a slice of processed cheese on a dry toasted sub roll, the flavor was not good at all, I took 2 bites and threw it away.  I'm sorry I was not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Great service and quality food, glad I stopped by. Had the Italian combo so delicious.."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good. We went in on 10/13 for lunch. There was only 1 girl working who was super nice but there was 1 person in front of us and 2 more came in after us. She apologized for the wait. There was a man and woman walking around the back and taking pictures of the restaurant so I am assuming the owners but they just kept doing what they were doing and not helping her. We ordered 2 subs and a smoothie. She finally asked the man to help her and he attempted to make our smoothie but I don't think he knew what he was doing by the way we was moving the blender while it was blending to try and move the ingredients around in the blender. I am glad we were off of work that day if we had gone in there during our lunch hour we would've been late going back so the wait was just way too long. I got a chicken sub and the meat was taken out of some type of a heating container on the back counter and I got it on a pita bread. The pita bread totally broke apart so I couldn't eat it like a sandwich and the chicken tasted like rubber it was horrible. My boyfriends sandwich he said was just OK he got a club sandwich. The best part of our lunch was the smoothie it really did taste good but that was the only thing that tasted good but it was way too expensive for the amount that you got. we will not be back. sorry again I wish it was a better review because I'd love to support a restaurant close to me. We are always looking for a good place to go."}
{"text":"Was in there during the week and had a great sandwich on fresh bread.  I really enjoyed the bread and asked the girl if they make their own bread.  She says it comes in and they bake it fresh daily.  

Later on in the week I got a coupon from them in the junk mail and went back on Sunday to take advantage of the offer.  The owner and his wife were outside the place smoking.  Then they came in and were watching the girl make my sandwiches like a hawk.  The coupon was a bogo offer so I got two subs and went home and ate them.  

POW! BANG! BOOM! WTF happened to the bread I loved?  The bread was dry, hard, tasted old, was crumbly and totally unenjoyable!  This is how sandwiches are served when the owners are around??!?!??!?!  It was better during the week when I went and there was just a blonde haired girl working.  NOTE TO SANDWICH servers everywhere:  If your bread is not fresh, is crumbly, dry, hard, or coming apart DO NOT SERVE IT. Consistency, consistency, consistency is very important.  Now because of these crappy sandwiches I will not return.  This place is soon to go under in that spot like Quiznos did, the $7 hot dog shop after that, and now this place will fold because they can not make a fresh and consistent sandwich.  Sad, very sad......."}
{"text":"Walked in as a first timer met the owner of the shop as he encouraged me to try the popping boba , I was a bit iffy about it.. he made me the love potion and my first sip was interesting but I must say I loved it and have gone back to try the sandwiches and other boba flavors. I must add that there is a ping pong table at the shop!!"}
{"text":"This place was suggested to me by my hair cutter at Fantastic Sam's next door. If someone works for tips is willing to tell you about a place, it's worth it. I took my son and it truly was worth it. I had a toasted Chicken Cordon Bleu, very nice. My son had the foot-long meatball, and it was also very good. Excellent service and quality food. We were planning our return visit before we even left"}
{"text":"So, i dont usually rate, but the bread at this place is bomb. Love the owner, always willing to help and I love the unique flare. I highly enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time just now and It was awesome. Bread was so fresh and soft and veggies were very fresh. I will definitely be going here again."}
{"text":"New place. Subs were not all that great. I had a 6 inch parmesan chicken sub which contain very little chicken that was like shredded. My son had a 6 inch meatball marinara which is his favorite and stated \"it was alright but subways is better\". He had 3 large meatballs on his sub. I gave this place 3 stars because the girls were really nice and the smoothies were pretty good. I'll stick to subway or jimmy johns for now."}
{"text":"Giving 3 stars just to say there's room for improvement.  We got 3 different subs to give this place a valid try.  The bread was fresh and yummy, the ingredients the same.  The aioli and house Italian also yummy.  Boba drink was quite nice.  Best part about this place is that it did not taste like Subway or Blimpies or Quiznos...not like some typical corporate fast food place...it tasted like awesome subs I could make at home.  And I definitely like to support local businesses.  Where the improvement possibilities come into play... that's simply experience.  Getting things set up to flow well, becoming more efficient and fluid in preparing the food, eliminating wasted steps, etc.  This place has some potential, as long as the owners are paying attention and eliminate the other reviews complaints (which are completely fixable...except for the one that says Subway is better, let Subway have the sheeple smh)."}
