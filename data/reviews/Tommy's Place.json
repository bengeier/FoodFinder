{"text":"Found this hidden gem while visiting friends! Such a small and home feel! The food was amazing and Tommy was super friendly! Will definitely have to come back!"}
{"text":"Tastefully decorated, carries great  ambiance, and the food is excellent. We really enjoy coming here for family get togethers or date nights. Great staff, and Tommy the owner treats the customers like family. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Was Looking for a causal place to eat dinner with 2 kids and this ended up being perfect! Great atmosphere, great live music and service! Mussels were really good and gone in no time. All of 4 of us opted for pasta that didn't disappoint. Great place!"}
{"text":"The food is very good.  But seating, at least for us on the night we visited, was unforgivable.  It was worse than if they had charged us half price for the food but asked us to sit in the parking lot.  

Here's what happened.

We arrived at around 5:15 p.m. last Saturday night.  It was still early and so the place was not yet in full swing.  Yet, we were seated between a 4-top and a 2-top.  This was not a problem on its own but I fail to see why a restaurant forces intimacy when it isn't necessary.  More than half of the room was empty on the other end, yet all the diners were beside each other.  The 4-top was comprised of retirees who had finished their meal but were enjoying their not so quiet conversation.  The 2-top was a couple who had arrived not long before we did.  

It did not take us too long to review the menus and order our drinks.  (Their Sangrias, by the way are very delicious.  I really wish I could come back for more or taste their other cocktails.)  Soon after our order was placed, people for a birthday party started arriving for the table directly behind my husband.  The table in the end had maybe 10 or 12 people.  They were not particularly loud or rambunctious.  I never heard anybody from their party say anything.  But had we known that there was going to be a birthday party that close to us, we would have requested a different seat or just left.  

The very big problem was the minute amount of space between the back of my husband's chair and the back of the other chairs at the birthday party table.  The space was extremely tight and resulted in my husband getting bumped many times.  At some point, the man sitting next to my husband at the other 2-top moved his chair so that he sat diagonally to his table because he was getting bumped as well even though there was more room behind him than my husband.  (A few important things to note:  we are not claustrophobic by any stretch of the imagination, we are not big people and do not require a lot of room, and we have no problems dining in communal settings.)  

The absolute worst point was when I saw a waitress with plates in both hands, try to pass behind my husband and in order to do so had to shimmy sideways and drop down a bit so that the space could accommodate her hips.  This resulted in the plate in her right hand getting very close to my husband's head, who luckily at that time was leaning forward.  What if she had miscalculated and a plateful of hot food fell on my husband.  It sounds funny, but really it isn't.  It is negligence, plain and simple.  To get an extra table or two in, the owner put its diners and workers at risk.  

Nothing in this story is an exaggeration.  And it pains me to write this review because the food was very good. Very good.  And very much worth the 10+ miles from Central Phoenix where we have many other options.  But I am writing this review because the experience was real, and because I want to help other diners who might include comfortable seating arrangements as a priority in their dining choices.  

I have not seen another Yelp review mention this issue, so maybe we just got the worst seat in the house on the worst night, ever.   Maybe some people are so big that they get bumped every time anywhere they eat, so they don't care.  Maybe some people like getting bumped when they eat because it is the only human touch they get.  Hence there being no issue for them.

Before we left, someone, presumably the owner, came over and asked about our meal.  My husband mentioned something about the seating situation and how he was bumped consistently throughout our meal.  The response was that their normal seating was changed because of the birthday party.  This simply cannot be true.  If you look at the pretty picture of the room, you will see that when the room is empty and all the seats are pushed in, there is barely enough room for multiple workers to move around in.  

By the time we left, the room had filled up.  I am barely 110 pounds and am not ungraceful but had to be very careful not to bump into another diner's chair on the way out.  I was not successful."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable patio.  Food is a good value as well.

This is a cozy comfortable place that prides itself as being \"off the grid\" as there is limited seating.  We especially enjoy the happy hour beer prices at $2 for all beers, bottle or draft.

Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Visited a few weeks back, cool environment, food was good. The HH menu looked great as well. Meatballs are a must have!"}
{"text":"The food, the service, the dessert, the ambiance is AMAZING!  If you're looking for some authentic Italian cuisine, look no further. This place is GOLDEN!!"}
{"text":"Tommy's Place has it down....warm surroundings, superb service, and perfected classics define this new valuable addition to the area. The clams had a nice sauce to dip, and the lemon piccata was superb..the owner is involved in every aspect of the establishment, which is a prerequisite to success. Don't miss out on this place !"}
{"text":"Ok place. I miss Lenero though . Took forever for them to open and no wonder... Stuff EVERY WHERE. .  Try to focus on food. Atmosphere is a big distraction. Too much."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely Amazing!  Well presented & delicious!  Friendly service!  We stopped in because of the great reviews.. I am glad we did!  At first I wasn't sure since the location can almost be missed.  However, don't pass this one up!  Took us awhile to figure what to eat since all the menu items looked great!  Can't wait to try all the other delicious food on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great food!! The atmosphere is amazing! Friendly service. After leaving another restaurant because we had not been served for 15 mins, our night was a on a low. As soon as we walked into Tommy's Place all the staff was very friendly! Service was on point. The food is the best Italian we've had in a long time. We will definitely we returned. Thanks for turning our crappy night into a awesome night out!"}
{"text":"Really good, authentic Italian food. Especially like the live music on a fri/Sat night. Like the fact that Tommy himself is around a lot of the time as well."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. This place has the same great food as New York's Best, but now it has the atmosphere to go along with it. The pizza is awesome!  The salads, sandwiches and pasta dishes are delicious. My daughter is a huge fan of the meatballs and sausage. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Outstanding food in a great neighborhood bar type setting. Dinner there last night with live music playing in the background. The best Caesar salad I have ever had; the dressing is amazing. Our table had chicken parm, a spicy penne, and lasagna; everything was great. For dessert we had a delicious cannoli. I definitely recommend Tommy's."}
{"text":"First time there, food was awesome, and incridble service! Defiently a place to go and bring friends, will be back again. I hade the ceasr salad with chicken, and freshly shreded parmasan cheese with a home made dressing, the chicken was perfectly cooked and tge fresh crutons were a great touch. Their pizza and sause was amazing and their triple chocolate cake was to die for!"}
{"text":"The food is so good!!! Took my daughter here for a date and Super bummed I've been driving by this place 10 times a week for a year and never knew what was waiting for me inside. I got the bolognese and it was a big portion. I wasn't planning on eating the whole thing but......I did. Service was great but the food did take a while to come out but it was well worth the wait. The decor was super neat and really well thought out. Also, a nice bar area with four flat screen TVs. I grew up in this area and super surprised by this restaurant. If you are in the North Phoenix area I highly recommend for date night."}
{"text":"Beware of some of the bartenders. Some are great, but others are awful. 
One, an old cow named Kat, is an imperious busybody who can't pour a drink to save her life. Her shots in mixed drinks are maybe 1/4 a single shot. Bad value and bad drinks. 
Stick to something she can't mess up. 

Also, the food is shockingly poor for a place that has been around in various forms for 25 years. Chicken wings are regularly red on the bone: not good. 

But, they have a nice patio deck."}
{"text":"So happy to have found this great restaurant! It's like walking into a New Your City place. The food and service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"We will never go anywhere besides Tommy's Place for fettuccine alfredo. The staff was very welcoming and provided great service. We ordered a caesar  salad with chicken, and fettuccine alfredo with chicken  but substituted penne. Our food came out faster than expected. The salad was not anything out of the ordinary but was nice and cold on a hot day. The pasta on the other hand was amazing. Every alfredo sauce I have had before did not taste close to comparison to Tommy's. We do not want to have alfredo pasta anywhere else in Arizona. Our food was delightful so we decided to try the dessert. The cannoli and tiramisu was pretty good. At the end of our meal the owner was very nice and made sure everyone had a good time. I recommend Tommy's Place to anyone who likes alfredo. We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the clambake. They didn't have the clam chowder that is supposed to come with the meal, so they gave us some chicken noodle soup that tasted like it came from a can and knocked a dollar off each of our meals. Fine. Then came the actual meal. Everything was brought out to us room temperature - not one thing was served hot. The clams were dry and chewy and flavorless. I actually had to spit one out because I couldn't even swallow it. The corn on the cob was dark, shriveled, and old to the point that after one bite, I couldn't even eat it. The chicken that came with the meal was bland, and had a texture like it had been boiled. It was gross. The only thing that was edible was the sweet potato. 

Now for the service. When we first got there, we were the only table. Our server initially pled with us not to leave over their being out of clam chowder, saying someone else left over it and that we were the first table she's had so far today. Then, once other customers came in, she couldn't even keep up with her tables. Our service all but stopped. We had to ask three times just to get to-go boxes because she kept walking past us empty-handed and saying, \"Oops! I forgot again!\" I seriously think 20 minutes went by before we got them.

It was my first experience there and it will be my last. Yuck."}
{"text":"This place is perfect! Great food, great atmosphere and amazing service! They have the perfect variety of food on their menu, and it's all so fairly priced that you can actually enjoy your dinner with a few drinks without feeling like you're breaking the bank. They have a huge patio and a very nice bar inside bar, but there are also smaller rooms if you're looking for a nice family dinner scene. The restaurant has a lot of character and history to it so it's fun to walk around and look at the things on the wall. I'm surprised more people don't know about this place! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. Waitstaff was attentive. Meatballs were good. Tomato sauce was so-so. A great place to have a beer and watch a game."}
{"text":"Great patio. Fair selection of beers. Very good prices on weekday lunch specials.  A worthy place to eat at."}
{"text":"Tommy's design and mindset with this place is fantastic. Great service with authentic Italian food and environment. My pasta was on point also with presentation and taste. If you live in the area or you're close by, THIS is the place for great Italian food and vibes."}
{"text":"Tommy's Place is a fresh addition to the North Phoenix dining scene and offers what the area has needed for a long time; a cozy, spotless, comfortable atmosphere where you can relax and have some amazing Italian food.  On two separate visits the food and service were top notch. Calamari fra Diavolo appetizer is a must try and gives the classic fried version a welcomed kick of spiciness that we absolutely enjoyed (had that on both visits).  The pasta selection is reminiscent of what you would find in Little Italy, not many places can make a decent Linguine and Clams, Tommy's is very good with a nice balance of garlic, olive oil and white wine, the only thing left on the plate were clam shells.  The Mediterranean salad was a nice plate to share with a good vinaigrette, artichoke hearts, calamata olives and feta and you can add chicken if you like.  We had the salad and a pizza on our last visit, the pizza crust was light, flavorful and baked just right.  Cannolis and espresso rounded out the meal and both were once again like being back on Mulberry Street, NYC. We will be regulars, because this is the kind of place that on your first visit they greet you like an old friend and the next time you go back you're family...that's how we felt when we walked in on our second visit."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem that has an awesome live
performer. The bar tender Jillian is pleasant and friendly. We are coming back tomorrow..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their atmosphere and there love for Italy.  The place itself is very small for the amount of people who go dine. The service was speedy and was well knowledgeable. However just a heads up, their food comes out extremely temperature hot. I like my food warm, so I had to wait awhile before the food cooled down. There food was tasteful,I'll come back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Great ambiance, very well kept secret. Fairly new but definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great, the food is always delicious! Try the specials of the day they never let you down, they have great pasta dishes & the sauces are amazing. Only thing I would improve on is the customer service, seem understaffed & short mannered. Besides that enjoy your dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice ambiance, very friendly employees. There were some unusual menu options, like a pepper and egg sub (which we loved because that's on The Sopranos), as well as typical pasta fare. The garlic bread was delicious and I was happily surprised that it came with entrees. And seriously, all the employees were great and really cared about providing a good experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner there on Tuesday night.   The restaurant has a great atmosphere and we really enjoyed the music.   First restaurant we have been in along time where we could talk to each other and not have to yell over the loud music.  Service was wonderful.  The bartender gave us excellent recommendations for dinner.  My husband had the lasagna and ate every last morsel.   He gave it an A.    I had pasta with vodka sauce and it was outstanding.  Also an A.  Tommy came by several times to check on our dinners.   Certainly showed us he is trying to have a top notch restaurant with great food at great prices.   We will be going back.

{"text":"Had dinner at Tommys last night, a Friday. It  was our first time there. Hubby said it was the best cheese steak EVER,  there marinara sauce is delicious. Try the chocolate cake!  Only complaint is the live music. It overwhelmed an otherwise great night. Will check in before hand on our next visit, and stay away on live music nights."}
{"text":"Stopped in for carryout after a long day of hiking. Food was delicious, service was great and we will return to dine in as the atmosphere is fantastic. Thanks, Tommy's!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place on a Wednesday night.  My wife had been here and thought it was just OK...lots of heavy food.  Cool setting, reminds me of the typical place on the east coast- old house, large bar, individual rooms.  

That's kind of where the happiness stopped for me.  Service was very friendly, but slow (she had six or seven tables herself).  

I ordered the \"smoked whole wings\" with bbq sauce on the side.  Menu claimed they were smoked in house.  Received a platter of fried, unseasoned wing parts (not that I care for whole wings, but the menu doesn't match).  Tasted one without dunking in sauce...just plain fried- no smoke flavor.  When you dip them the bbq sauce has smoke flavor- so perhaps I uncovered a little trick they play.  Waitress admitted they \"might\" smoke them very quickly and then fry.  Hmm.

Wife got fried perch and was pretty happy with it.  Although she wanted the perogies but  was told they were frozen...we can get frozen perogies at home.  

I got the Cafe Filet Sliders.  Thank God they gave me a side of spicy \"bistro\" sauce or I don't think my saliva could have broken down each bite.  

I'd go back for a drink and  snack in the summer, since they have a great patio.  But I don't think I'd go back for much else.  Not horrible, but there are better holes in the wall in Rocky River for food."}
{"text":"We tried this place out for the first time last week. My husband has an egg allergy so Tommy himself went back in the kitchen and made my husband a certain egg-containing dish special, without eggs. Amazing hospitality here and the ambience is awesome. Thanks, Tommy! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service. First time here and pleasantly surprised. Everything was bright,clean and well appointed. I like the owner being on premise making sure you have good food and experience. I certainly would recommend."}
{"text":"Great Food. A fun new place to have a meal. I had the Stromboli. Very good. Tommy and Tommy jr are great hosts.  The seafood combo was incredible."}
{"text":"Great first impression and personable staff! The ambience is perfect for date night and good conversation! Food was delicious and hot off the stove. Definitely will be back to try other traditional dishes and create more memories. Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time visitors. Had to wait 20 min for a table on Friday evening. Staff was attentive, keeping us informed. Food was perfectly prepared; pasta was perfectly Al dente. Not undercooked, just right. Service was quick even with an appetizer. Outstanding! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere service is wonderful.
Plenty of parking in back. Pasta is the best."}
{"text":"So excited to find an authentic Italian restaurant in north Phoenix! It felt more like a neighborhood restaurant in Manhattan, with the decor, comfortable vibe and exceptional food and service. We had two pasta dishes. The shrimp romano was a special that night -- with the biggest shrimps I've ever seen, sauteed with mushrooms, pancetta and peas in a light white wine sauce flavored with garlic and lemon. Out of this world. My husband had a spicy red sauce ziti with sausage, very zingy. Large portions but so good we ate the whole thing. And the garlic bread, yummy. Everyone from the host to the server to the helpers were friendly, attentive and engaged in their work. Bravo!"}
{"text":"OMG,  the food was delicious. I ordered the Linguine and White Clam Sauce, could not put my fork down,  so full.  Will totally go back!"}
{"text":"Good solid bar; TV's on sports and Fox news just like at the house!

One issue though; got food to go and while it was pretty much ok, the portions ratio to the listed price was underwhelming.

To my point; when I have to boil more pasta at home to add to my dish then that's a red flag somewhat.

But I like the bar and most likely will return for that yet not so much for the take out."}
{"text":"First time at Tommy's. Excellent food and service.  Absolutely a great resteraunt.

We'll be back our next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"This was a great new neighborhood Italian place. we started with bruscheta and meatballs. very tasty. the table had lasagna, chicken picata, chicken marsala and eggplant parm. all of our plates were cleaned off. we left fat and happy. fair prices and great service."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place in North Phoenix. The Food is amazing and the staff makes you feel right at home. Very clean environment and the art work is beautiful."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant!! Great service and the food was incredible. The live music just adds to the atmosphere in this cozy restaurant. We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"WOW! Felt like I was back East. Started walking up and thought oh no another pizza joint boy was I wrong. The live jazz was great the food was even better and the prices were unbelievable. Out of 5 stars I would give it a 6.5!!! And whatever you do get the tiramisu it's as homemade as it gets. Will definitely be going back for seconds. Thank you Tommy's for being another great hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I tell everyone from back East about Tommy's Place. It's the BEST Italian food by far! The food, atmosphere, people are all amazing. Have been here for special occasions (i.e. Father's Day, Husband's bday, 7yo son chose it for his bday, etc.) and wouldn't want to go anywhere else. Going this week and already drooling ;) If you like Italian food, definitely go to Tommy's. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I just had a wonderful dinner here with my three children. Our server, Jason, was very kind and attentive. The food was good, the people were wonderful - Tommy himself, came by to ask after us three times during our meals. Added benefit - the sangria was incredible."}
{"text":"We stopped in for the first time on my birthday. This is the REAL DEAL Italian restaurant, owned and run by Italians. It's like New York, but here in the valley.  I came for lunch and had the Antipasto salad, which was phenomenal. Service was amazing and my boyfriend's fettuccini Alfredo was divine. 

I will be back. It was wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat and enjoy music on the weekend. Everything I've ordered has been perfect. Tommy and his staff makes you feel very special. I've made some new friends while dining at the bar.  The music is the best in the valley."}
{"text":"From the outside, you'd blink and drive by this place. Don't let the casual and forgettable exterior fool you. The inside is hopping! 

I almost hate to write this review because Tommy's Place is so good, I don't want to let the cat out of the bag. The ambiance on the inside is a good mix of romantic, casual, and fun. If you're looking for a great place for date night, come out on Friday or Saturday night! There's a great live singer who only compliments the heavenly food. *Call ahead to make a reservation because it's a small place. And it's always packed on those nights*. 

The owner is from NY, so it's more of a NY Italian restaurant than say Northern Italian fare. There are big flat screens with NY sports teams playing in the background. It's tastefully decorated.

But it's the food that will keep you coming back, time and time again. We have yet to have a bad meal there. Tonight, we happened to make it for Happy Hour: we ordered the bacon wrapped dates with goat cheese. So gooood. Their house moscato was nice and sweet, but not overly so. 

Thus far, my favorite dish has been the shrimp scampi. My husband enjoys their homemade pizzas; you pick your toppings. Whatever you decide, always get the stromboli for your table. The outside bread has a nice buttery light onion flavor to it. With your meal, you'll also enjoy some damn good seasoned French bread. The prices aren't astronomical, unlike other Italian places. The eggplant parmesan is something ridiculous like $8.95! 

Do yourself a favor, pick up the phone, and make that reservation for this Friday night!"}
{"text":"Tommy's will make every attempt to create the dish you remember your grandma making!  I love garlic, oil, crushed red pepper and fresh Parmesan cheese......it was great!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised! The decor and atmosphere were fantastic..really loved the look.  Our server, Tonya was so friendly and the food was really delicious.  I am excited to have a great place to go back to.  Can't wait to try the dinner dishes.  Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Omg why haven't I've been here before? This food is sooooo good! The staff is so nice! The owner comes out and speaks like in Italy! LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Tried to get in last night without reservations but because they were so busy we could not be seated.  The owner was so nice we decided to come back today for lunch. Once again we met Tommy the owner who is very very nice. Now the food! Great is not enough!! Wonderful food reasonable prices and friendly people makes this a go to place!!"}
{"text":"What can I say I love this place. My wife and I have been here a few times already. Great atmosphere great staff and Tommy is such a great host. We enjoyed the food here very much. We just visited here this past weekend and we sat at the bar. The bartender was very helpful and offered some delicious drinks. They have live music which makes a nice relaxing environment. They make you feel at home and part of the family. Reminds me of being back home in my old neighborhood. Food is delicious and good size portions. You would leave feeling full and happy. We are definitely going to be returning to Tommy's Place."}
{"text":"Back again!!

Last time my husband had the Chicken Marsala, which he thought was amazing! I had the pizza, I have a hard time passing up pizza!!

This week we came in Sunday and they were having their Sunday only Mamas Gravy. My husband had a hard time not ordering the Marsala, but went with the Mamas Gravy and he loved it! I decided to venture away from my pizza and had the Chicken Parmesan, winner winner!!

This might have to be out Sunday spot for the Mamas Gravy!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome and the food even better. The staff are very friendly, especially John. If you want some great, fresh Italian food go check it out!"}
{"text":"Tommy's Place is easy to miss as your cruising down Bell Road, so I recommend that you get the address in your GPS asap because this is not a place you want to miss.  Looking for great Italian food and a cool vibe?  Then look no further.  Service was impeccable.  We were seated in the loft area upstairs and it was such a great view from above.  Food we excellent too, and when I asked my husband where he wants to go for his birthday next month - he didn't even hesitate, but said Tommy's Place.  So that's where we'll be heading."}
{"text":"Friend made a reservation for around twenty people, and they accommodated us really well!

Food was solid. I got the baked ziti, and it was delicious! Well made and ate all of it during dinner LOL. Food was also served really fast even when we had such a large group!

The owner and the staff were also extremely nice to us. Honestly such great service.

Parking can be found behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"First time there tonight very cool place great food and fantastic service!! Gnocchi was the special tonight FAB"}
{"text":"I normally dislike giving a negative review especially someplace we normally really enjoy. Tonight we ordered carry out which consisted of a pizza and two dinner salads. The pizza was great! Crust wasn't dried out and the toppings were fresh. My grip is with the salads. Two salads that had about a cup of lettuce, one tomato wedge, one onion slice and two olives. Oh, and I forgot to mention that they failed to put the salad dressing in our order too. The best part was the $13.00 that we paid for it. Shameful!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Where has Tommy's Place been all this time?  Always researching East Coast italian restaurants in Scottsdale and Phoenix on Yelp and yet I never ran into Tommy's Place.  Maybe because Tommy's Place sounds more like a restaurant that serves American food.  Well, I read a Yelper's review and decided to give the place a try.  
The decor was quite interesting/funky with bicycles and all kinds of stuff hanging from the ceiling or on the walls.  Lots of NY photos and big screen TV's across from the bar.  It was really cool.  

Ordered Shrimp parmigiana with angel hair pasta and chicken marsala sauce with mushrooms and ziti.  The marsala sauce which usually comes with the pasta was substituted for FRA DIAVOLO sauce (spicy marinara).  The shrimp parmigiana was amazing with 5 HUGE shrimp and angel hair with delicious marinara sauce (real east coast flavor--not sweet).  I didn't even take a photo for this review because I jumped into the food!   I couldn't stop eating it.  The chicken breast was tender, nicely cooked and the marsala sauce was not too sweet.  The FRA DIAVOLO sauce on the ziti was really spicy just the way we like it.  The food came with a few pieces of garlic bread on the house, not the usual bread basket.  
We literally cleaned our plates.  And BTW, there was live music as it was a Saturday and they have jazz on Saturdays and Fridays.  Nice vibe.  
I spoke to John on the way out and he told me he was from Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.  Arthur Avenue is an enclave with some of the best italian restaurants, bakeries and grocery stores in NYC.  
Coming back real soon and as they say in the Bronx:  FAGETTA ABOUT IT."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a REAL Italian restaurant since I have moved to AZ, and I have finally found it. Saw the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a chance, and man I was not disappointed. The look and feel of the restaurant is perfect with the decorations of NYC to the modern design of the entire place. It was packed for a Saturday night so that was a good sign when we walked in. We were greeted right away and the East Coast accent let me know we were going to be ok! 

They sat us and had great live jazz playing and it was just a fun atmosphere. It must be the entire family working at this place as they were all from the East Coast as our waitress had an accent as well. Great customer service with everyone always checking on us. The food was great I went with the calamari and shrimp scampi and it was A+. No complaints for this place and I will be bringing the rest of my Jersey family next time."}
{"text":"Great food and great view, my group sat on the 2nd level.  Took a bit longer to cook our food, but it was totally worth the wait.  Services were excellent with live music every Friday and Saturday nights.  It's a must try if you don't like chain Italian restaurants!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian in Phoenix hands down. The best mozzarella sticks I've ever had. The baked ziti is delicious and fresh cheese that has actually flavor! Service is always amazing & the live music is really great too. The inside is decorated so beautifully and is great for girls night, dates or with the kids. The pizza is delicious as well! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  We were at a furniture store close by that recommended this place. Cool atmosphere but really it's about the food. My wife got the pasta lunch special:  spaghetti, chicken, arrabbiata sauce with capers and kalamata olives. The pasta and chicken were cooked perfectly!  I got the Italian steak sandwich but couldn't get enough of the pasta. Very nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Visited this location for the first time based on a recommendation and online reviews. Parking can be tough here as it is located on a small lot right off of the street. The layout and ambiance if very good, I would give it a 4 star.  The service was not as good.  My girlfriend had the audacity to ask about the cost of the drinks and after that, I felt we were treated differently.  That aside, I ordered the chicken parmigiana and thought it was ok, nothing special.  No bread was brought out prior to the meal and when I asked about the garlic bread, was told it came with the meal but it was literally the smallest piece of bread I have ever been given at a restaurant and especially since I ordered the chicken parmigiana, would of thought it would come with more as a staple of the meal.  Price was a little on the high side but not excessive. For 2 entrees, 1 glass of wine and a desert (ordered a piece of cake which again was very small for the $8 they charge for it), the total came to about $55 before tip.  If the meal was amazing, could put up with the rest and even recommend but as it stands, for me, I would say it was a mediocre experience and nothing worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"Great fresh food, very friendly staff, Tommy is great, and the vibe of fantastic.  We were there for a mid afternoon bite.  Only had the roasted vegetables and the spinach salad but they were both great.  Can't wait to come back for a full meal!  Thanks Tommy!"}
{"text":"Simply the best cream sauce I've ever had. The bartender was great! My martini was perfect. The owner is always around making sure everything is going well. The live music was great to eat dinner too. Honestly one of the best eating experiences I've had here in Phoenix. Will be back in a week for my husbands birthday! Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Really had a great meal, very good service will return and I highly recommend it. Finally a place in North Phoenix for fine cusine."}
{"text":"Love it!  From the appetizer to the espresso. John was the bartender and recommended the Calabrian sunrise vodka drink he invented. Very refreshing!   Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Great courtyard deck and open air bar. Owners are always there to greet you. Food is casual and hearty.  Our favorite neighborhood place."}
{"text":"This place is great. I go here all of the time and it's quaint, the food is outstanding, the customer service is great and everyone is so nice. I just love it. The mussels are fabulous and the pasta is always tasty. It has that \"Cheers\" feeling to it so two thumbs up. The decor is great too."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Italian Bar and Restaurant look no more. Tommy's is out of my area about a 30 minute drive but it's worth every minute. I absolutely love the Stromboli it's huge and I ate the entire thing because it was so delicious ! I wish there were more places like this, however the fact that there's not should mean a longevity for this company tell all your friends and go try Tommy's!"}
{"text":"After seeing Tommy's on three websites each with +4.5 rating we decided to give it a try. Loved everything from the Caesars salad with homemade dressing to chicken picatta and chicken parmesian. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. We'll make this a regular stop when in the mood for Italian food."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars, but I have to say that Tommy's delivers on ambiance and taste. I ordered the mussels and the taste and quality was among the best I have had. Meatballs were excellent. Love the eclectic warm feel of the restaurant. Met the owner, who went out of his way to ensure a great meal. This is our new favorite. Keep it up Tommy's!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service and cozy, elegant atmosphere. I will definitely be coming back with friends and family!"}
{"text":"What a gem! We couldn't have been happier to have found this place.  The chicken piccata was very good as was the homemade Tiramisu. The wine selection was limited however the French Cabernet was great especially for the price. Loved the ambiance and we really enjoyed the trumpet player who was excellent.  We are at the bar and Kristen the bartender took great care of us. Got to meet Tommy who was wonderful. We hope to return next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time visitors.   Brought the whole family. Don't be put off by the exterior. The inside is welcoming to all.  Great atmosphere. 

Service was perfect.  Tommy himself asked how everything was. 

The food was delicious.  We had a variety of dishes pasta with sausage. Pasta with vodka sauce and tune.   No complaints.  We will be back and will bring friends."}
{"text":"First off top notch service, excellent and cozy atmosphere with great decor, phenomenal owners and staff. The food is absolutely as authentic as it could get . I had the chicken piccata and my roommate had chicken Vesuvio .. with a end dessert of tiramisu which you could tell was handmade and not brought in .  Every single time I've been here ( this is the 2nd time , i never finished my review) the food has been fresh and delicious. Great prices for the quality of the food .. exactly what you'd think an Italian restaurant should be like .. 
since this is the 2nd time I've been here , today I got the linguini salmone fume and my roommate got the eggplant parmigiana.. just too good .. check out the pictures but seriously bring your wife or husband or partner here .. you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The only point of disagreement I have with the review posted by Maria S. is that the food is not very good.  I consider lasagna to be the acid test for an Italian joint, as fish & chips would be for an English pub.  You don't get this wrong.  The lasagna was slightly better than what you would find in a cafeteria, slightly better than what you might find in a refrigerated tractor trailer with \"SYSCO\" emblazoned on the side.  

The lasagna noodles were thin, overcooked, limp, like the thing had been left in a steaming tray and forgotten until after the Sterno can burned out.  The lasagna was not hot when it was served, not cold, but not hot. What could be sadder than that?  I guess Tommy's legal team told him that if he was going to cram tables and chairs together so tightly he risked having wait staff spill hot food, exposing the business to lawsuits from scalded diners. Tommy's creative solution to that dilemma was not to arrange the tables in a civilized and sensible manner, no, it was to just serve the food at room temperature so his staff could safely shimmy, scoot, slide, stumble and trip around the room with warm plates of food, bumping into every chair all night long. Simple solution to a simple problem.

There was not one browned bit of Mozzarella/ Parmigiano or whatever cheese mix was used on the top, it was all pale, soft and as I said, not hot.  One single minute under the broiler could have saved this dish.  I guarantee you that the cook that produced this was not Italian, had no Italian blood, and probably was not even from New Jersey.  I don't know, perhaps this is how they serve lasagna in Mexico and Latin America but somebody has to show the cooker guy how to turn on the broiler.   

The sangria was enjoyable, the brandy and Sprite were a nice touch. I have no complaints with the tomato bisque, but that was a long drive from Central Phoenix where the options are plenty to pay so much for so little and have my chair kicked and back brushed all throughout.  At one point two old people from the birthday party behind me embraced each other right over my head.  I could feel their clothing on BOTH sides of my fucking head."}
{"text":"Stoped by for a late afternoon drink. 
They had 8 beers on tap and picked Blue Moon really cold with a fresh slice of orange. Looked at the menu and order a small pizza pie which was wonderful? Thought I was back in New York. What a great combo cold beer with great thin crust pizza. One of my favorite combos. Very nice & helpful staff, will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian restaurant. From the outside the décor looks a little suspect but the interior is beautifully decorated and creates an authentic atmosphere that pairs well with the friendly staff. I dined as part of a large reservation and we were very well taken care of, with delicious fresh garlic bread offered gratis. 

I had the manicotti and was very satisfied with the food, you can't really go wrong at a place like this.

I will definitely be back for a date night or intimate night out with friends."}
{"text":"So we went here the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and it was pretty packed but it seems like it's always packed. They have a good selection and everything we had was very good. What I recommend the most is the Spumoni it is absolutely delicious and I find myself craving it often I love that they have unique items sometimes. The service is great and you can tell they enjoy work my there. Great place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely adore this place! This is a little hidden gem. The decor is awesome and the ambience is sultry. The owner Tommy is always around and very welcoming. He looks like someone I want to have as a best friend. 

My fav bar tender is Connor, he makes a delicious pear martini! I have the most fun when I sit at the bar. 

All of the food I have had here has been so bomb. AND there's live music on the weekends! The servers are attentive and food delivery is timely. It's like one big family in here. 
The spicy calamari is a must try! You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu and everything is decently priced. The meatballs are amazing... and I never like meatballs. Wednesday is ladies night so there are deals such as $5 off bottles of wine, $5 sangria and $6 well martinis. There's even live music on ladies night!"}
{"text":"Brought my dad here for his birthday once. We got a few pasta dishes, salads and pizza.... we loved it all l. Atmosphere was great and all the servers and bartenders were really attentive. Hope this place is here to stay!"}
{"text":"Wow. What an unexpected surprise in an unexpected location. I have never been blown away by a place here in Arizona; That is until I tried Tommy's Place. I found this place by chance- I had an ultra cool Steampunk hat that I listed on Craig's List and on New Years day I received a call from a gentleman named Tommy wanting to come and look at it. He tells me he owns a restaurant where he wants to display the hat. After negotiating, we decide on doing trade. He gets the hat and I get a gift card to his restaurant. Me being the foodie that I am, I was rather excited to try a new place. He told me that if I tried it once, I'd be back, and that a ton of local celebrities frequent here, including many of the Phoenix Suns players. \"That's what they all say\" I thought to myself. Boy was I wrong and boy was he right. The atmosphere is super cool, trendy, artsy, and interesting. Tommy (the owner) scours Craig's List for interesting items to display on the walls, which he does with such style. From Vespas, to umbrellas, to cheetahs, and now Steampunk hats, this restaurant is like a museum of cool stuff! It feels like a restaurant you'd experience in a cosmopolitan area, not on 28th street and Bell. The staff is the nicest, most attentive staff I've ever experienced in my life, from the host to the busser, to the servers. Everyone went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable, enjoying ourselves, and having a good time. The service was impeccable and we never had to wait to order a drink or have our questions answered. Tommy is there 7 days a week, and makes a point to chat with all customers. He came up to us several times to check in on us and to make sure everyone was taking care of us. 

Then there's the food. I've been to some amazing top notch restaurants in some top notch cities (London, Tokyo, Sydney, New York to name a few) and Tommy's Place trumps them all and is now officially my favorite restaurant in the world.  My favorite restaurant used to be in Sydney, now it's in Arizona. Who would have thought?! We started with the braised pork belly appetizer that literally melts in your mouth. The owner then surprised us and bought us the antipasto salad. Artichokes, an array of meats, pepperoncinis, this was one of the best salads that has ever touched my lips. We then had the King Crab Ravioli. I'm typically not a fan of ravioli but I am now. This was truly outstanding. We also had the clams in the garlic and white wine sauce, which were DELICIOUS. The owner then wanted us to try their cannoli, so bought some for us. Again, these didn't disappoint and were delightfully delicious. Tommy was telling us stories of his travels, and came out with two glasses of Italian liquor that he received as a gift. We LOVED how it really felt like a neighborhood restaurant where the owner really takes an interest in his guests and really wants them to feel at home and have a good time. He had mentioned that he doesn't do coupons or promos, he just takes really good care of his guests so they rave about him and the restaurant, spread the word, and so that they return. Well it worked. We WILL be going back and here I am raving about the place!  

In summary, of any restaurant in any country I've been to (and I've lived in over 10 countries and visited many others) Tommy's Place blows them all out of the water. The best service, most delicious food, and coolest atmosphere, this place really did surprise me. I always used to make fun of people who claimed Arizona has good food. After experiencing Tommy's Place, I must admit, I now agree with them. And I never thought that day would come! Tommy's Place is a MUST."}
{"text":"After deciding to watch a New York themed movie at Harkins 16, I thought it woud be appropriate to have lunch at a New York themed restaurant in the area so I chose this place. It turned out to be an excellent choice. Inside, the restaurant is nicely appointed with lots of NY decorative touches. I ordered manicotti, a dish I haven't had since leaving New York (if you want to pronounce it the Noo Yawk way, say manigaut ;) It was delicious, with the freshest ricotta and some garlic bread to sop up every bit of the superb sauce. The restaurant did not look that big from outside but  you will be surprised once you enter; seating - both at the bar and at the regular tables - is plentiful. Service is very friendly and prices are reasonable. Not much parking in front but there are additional parking spaces at the back."}
{"text":"Love this Italian place, the food is always delicious. Mama's gravy on the Sunday special is excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome decor, great vibe, friendly and fast service- great food! Definitely a fun and do again and again place!"}
{"text":"This place is Tops! It has an authentic Italian menu, sangria made in house, a fun atmosphere, and an amazing staff! The owner, Tommy, is there to greet you and treat you to his favorite menu picks! They have live music that sets the mood. But most importantly they treat you like family friends at a reasonable price! I will definitely recommend this it to All my closest foodie friends and will be back real soon. Thank you Tommy for the perfect dining experience!"}
{"text":"First time here with the family. I ordered the lasagna and played it safe, one of those things if they mess up a common dish then you question everything else. It was NOT like that, lasagna was hot as served [so careful] but the texture and flavor is all there. Mozzarella sticks were amazing and the fried zucchini, on the other hand the calamari had a weird taste than most. Owner was nice to us, our waitress was nice and consistent. Go here with family seems more homely that way."}
{"text":"I was so excited to walk in to try this new Italian restaurant and so excited to see John and Tommy from New York's best Italian bistro.  This place has awesome decor, a ton of TV's for football.

The food was amazing!!!  We will be back a lot."}
{"text":"Great place.  So excited for a new Italian restaurant.  Very cool atmosphere and awesome staff!"}
{"text":"Horribly slow, actually imcompetent service. Sat at table for 10 minutes waiting to order. Finally came around to asking what we wanted for dinner, we   ordered 2 appetizers at the same time as our meals, 1 part of an entree arrived and one of the sides  (fries)  arrived 1st, 20 minutes after we ordered, 10 minutes later along came 2 other entrees came. No salad dressing with entree salad had to ask 3x for it. Then, last of the meals came, 10 minutes after that. Still no appetizers. Asked for 3rd time if he was ever planning on bringing them, the response \" they are training a new \"chef\".  Really? A \"chef\" is highly skilled in culinary arts, you made a bad hire Tommy.  And news flash, the old \"we have a new X training\" is as lame as it gets. CHECK PLEASE."}
{"text":"Absolutely great staff and food.  Decor, music, and noise level were perfect.  The usuals are spot on and the specials can be trusted.  An awesome Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple times, both for drinks and for dinner; their drinks are off the charts - they have a cucumber lime martini that would make anyone feel like a princess! Our food has been really good - the Chicken Vesuvius is really, really good - capers, tangy, pasta, and yummo.  It doesn't look like much on the outside, but when you get into the joint, it's really neat inside.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because it's been hit or miss with the friendliness of the owner; he was in a bad mood one night and took it out on everyone - including the patrons. Overall recommend."}
{"text":"I've been very disappointed with my only two visits here because of the food.  In short, its not very good and the rest of our table agreed too.  I've tried the Wings, Crab Cakes, Hanger Steak and the Short Ribs.  The Short Ribs were probably the  worst I have ever had but I'll admit the Hanger Steak was pretty good.  They claim the wings are smoked but I'm highly skeptical and pretty sure they were fried and covered in too much sauce.  

I do like the atmosphere and setting but they need to improve on the food before I go back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Italian restaurant in the Valley. The food and service is absolutely top notch!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! We've tried several items on the menu, always homemade...fresh...hot.. and authentic Italian! Manicotti with added Meatballs on the side are to die for! We drive 30 minutes to eat here, worth it for sure!! Employees and owner are very personable and the service is always exceptional!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! The food was of perfect quantity and quality, service was great - hosts were very friendly and welcoming and the decor is superb. It's by far the cutest place I've visited in the valley!!"}
{"text":"We are so in love - thank you for a very special visit.  This is where we celebrated my mom's birthday on a semi-impromptu trip to Phoenix. Great food, kind service, attentive business owner, lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"INCORRECT HOURS. CLOSES AT 11PM. 

Fast & friendly service. Everything is cooked and seasoned perfectly. Place is clean and decorated nicely. Eat here! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I ordered a meal for myself for carry-out on a Monday night. 

Food: delicious. Calamari was light, excellently cooked, and deliciously salty. Just enough. Marinara dipping sauce was fine. Rather simple, but complemented the calamari. Manicotti was fine. It was moist, packed with ricotta. 

Price / value. This is where I have to give a pretty low rating. I was kind of surprised by the prices on the online menu but was intrigued and wanted Italian tonight so i ordered despite the average $13+ price on every item. I am even more disappointed after picking up my order and seeing the TINY servings. For a $27 meal I have a small order of calamari ($13) that was fine for me - one person who eats like a bird. If i was sharing this appetizer it would have hardly been satisfying. The manicotti ($14) was comprised of two small enchilada style servings, each smaller in length than my fork. At $27, i was expecting to have dinner and enough for lunch tomorrow. Not a chance. 

Ambiance: quaint restaurant, moderately busy for a Monday at 7 PM. Noise wasn't too bad. Indoor seating looked comfortably spaced, Bar had televisions with traditional bar seating and high tops, outdoor seating available on a small but cozy patio. Decor was pleasant and noise level was just fine for a nice dinner for two or a small group. 

All in all, if you're looking for a reasonable meal or if you're on a budget, this is not the place for you. If you're looking for a nice meal, price doesn't matter, this may become your new favorite place."}
{"text":"Tommy... I'm a little obsessed with your place, and I am so glad your place is not too far from mine. Heyyy!! But really, it's so great to see such a cute, shiny new, interesting place in between all the chain restaurants, random tire shops, furniture joints, and car lot's. I know this locations has tried to be a few thing's in the last 5 or so years. But I think Tommy got this one right. 

After coming her on a double date last week I could not wait to come back to check out the happy hour with a girlfriend (shot out to Natalie! See you next Wednesday girl!) See, I really couldn't wait. This place was packed full last Friday. So full we had to sit upstairs. Upstairs? Yup... and it was kind of great. We got to look down on the dinning room. There was live Jazz type music that gave this place even more of a New York/Italian Charm. 

Our server was super charming as well, with his thick Italian accent. As he told us all of the specials for the day, they all sounded delicious and all things I have no idea how to pronounce. He did however sell me on something I was not expecting to get. Some type of white, velvety, Italian sausage, potato, veggie soup.  The only thing missing from this special was that I wanted more of it. We also had the Bruschetta to start. No complaints. For dinner I decided to play it safe, plus I am not familiar with a whole lot of Italian dishes. The Penne Alla Arrabbiata: Garlic, tomatoes, basil and crushed red peppers with Italian Sausage. This was a pretty simple dish but it was fresh, tasty, and perfect. And you know that I HAD to have a Cannoli. I have had one Cannoli that I fell in love with years ago and have yet to find one that even comes close. Well... I am thrilled to say I finally found it here at Tommy's. So good, so creamy and crunchy. Doesn't have a store bought taste like many do. I would come back here for the Cannoli alone. But lucky I was happy with everything.

I hope to see you all at Tommy's soon because he's going to be my new BFF."}
{"text":"Another fabulous evening @ Tommy's.  
Food  prepared beautifully, nightly specials wonderful.
Service, food, ambiance, are beyond amazing.  
Thank you for making our evening so special."}
{"text":"Great Italian place. The service is great and the food is delicious. We've been back several times and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"We found this place while searching Yelp for new restaurants and I am so glad we did. It's close to home, the ambiance is great, the staff is friendly and the food is delicious. We didn't have a reservation but we were lucky there was one open table left when we arrived. The place is small so you might want to consider making a reservation. The tables are tightly packed in there but it was still comfortable. 

The food was great! Our waitress was sweet but it was her first night and she seemed a bit overwhelmed and not sure of the menu. Chicken piccata is one of my favorite dishes and their version with a side of fettuccini did not disappoint. The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the pasta was perfect. The garlic bread was fantastic. My husband had the chicken parm sandwich with a side of fries and our friend had the meatball sandwich with fries. Both of them were very happy with their choices. Our son ordered the cheese pizza and loved it. I snagged a piece of his crust and admit it was pretty darn good. The only hiccup to the night was they forgot my sons pizza and we were almost done with our food  before it came out. They did the right thing and removed it from the bill and he said it worth the wait so we won't hold it against them and we will be back."}
{"text":"Best meatballs I've ever tasted! Great service and the atmosphere was inviting. Tommy is proud of his restaurant and he should be. I can't wait to have momma's gravy on Sunday's and check out the live music! I look forward to many fabulous meals here! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"While there are many choices for dining in Phoenix no place I can think of has the look and fell of being in N.Y. At least not until now with the opening of Tommy's Place. Last Friday we met friends there for dinner. Pasta was excellent, the nightly special was osso bucco, the best I've had in 20 years. Live jazz music on Friday and Saturday nights from 6 to 9 p.m. the trumpet player was fabulous. John and Tommy are the owners and opened Tommy's Place to showcase their talents. Thank you for the culinary treat."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant. Reviews were good. Ordered lasagna, baked ziti, garlic bread, chocolate cake.
Upsides: Egyptian bartender is great, friendly, a looker. Inside is nice. Chocolate cake was good.
Downsides: If you're serving small portions (for an Italian restaurant), the food better be memorable. It's not. At $13-15 per dish, it's small and doesn't seem homemade. The garlic bread at $4 is offensively small. A ripoff. Management better rethink whether a $.25 piece of bread is worth a reputation.
Overall, the food is about 25% overpriced for quality and quantity. It's good, not great and benefits only from a lack of good Italian competition in the immediate vicinity.
For the money, there are definitely other options. Go to Spinatos."}
{"text":"Absolutely love your place! Decided to stop by and try it Based on reviews we read. We were not let down at all. Food was amazing, especially the bruschetta! It was the best we have ever had. ERIC our waiter was awesome, drinks were good, and everyone employee we talked to thanked us for coming in to check the place out. If you haven't tried this place, you must make plans to go! Thank you guys for an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"I wish I had some photos to share. We have intended to try this place for several months- 
I wish I had some pictures but all the plates are clean!
The meatballs are the best in Phoenix. Those who know me recognize the power of that statement. This place will definitely be in the regular rotation.  Well done Tommy's, well done."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to go for dinner and found this gem on Yelp. I had the baked fish special over linguine and it was fantastic!! One of the best Italian meals I've had in a very long time.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service!! We had a surprise birthday party for my friend, we had a total of 12 people. The owner demanded everyone must pay in cash. On the night of the party one person did not bring cash (11 others did) and the bartender said she would allow the payment with credit card at the end of the night. When we went to pay, the owner would not allow the one person to process their payment with credit card. He became very angry and started to yell at us. When we pointed out the person who told us we could process one , he yelled \"she isn't even running this party\". So very rude and disrespectful!  No reason to act the way he did. Highly recommend going elsewhere to avoid problems. Not sure he can deny credit card payments for some but not all customers- guess that is something I will report as well. Food was not worth the money either. I heard no one compliment the taste of the food."}
{"text":"Yes, you must try this place! You won't believe what they've done with this space! This is so charming, so cool, and so unexpected! Start with an appetizer or wine with Happy Hour up until 6:00 pm. We had the meatball slider.  Yum! A perfect antipasto salad was just right! I had the lovely chicken with prociutto and baked with cheese and house red sauce, and my husband is still raving about his linguine and clam sauce. We took home a decadent dark chocolate cake which is rich and the perfect ending. The staff is so happy and they seem to like their jobs and they are proud to serve you because the food is that good! The owner is so welcoming and this place is a must see."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant and bar. The staff always has a warm and welcome demeanor. The food options are perfect from an appetizer to a meal. And Tommy is always around to shake ypur hand, offer a suggestion or kist say hello."}
{"text":"I have been here only once , but I wish I was longer in the city to visit it multiple times. Obvious order are the milkshakes. I ordered coffee milkshake which was pretty good. An even better choice was the cookies and cream milkshake. The quantity of the milkshake is amazing and it is really cheap. Love the ambience too. All in all would love to visit it again."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!!!  We had been in Flagstaff for the weekend and we're heading home. We got the opportunity to stop in North Phoenix for dinner. My boyfriend was feeling Italian and this place did not disappoint. 

He had the \"Mamas gravy\" a special they were doing and it was amazing!!!! 

I had pasta with vodka sauce and chicken. It came out and they forgot the chicken and had the chicken to me before my second bite!  The service was absolutely outstanding!  

Adorable interior and just the warm yummy meal I needed after a long day on the slopes in Flagstaff!"}
{"text":"If there were more stars we'd add them. Just had a FABULOUS meal at this little gem. Perfection from start to finish. Our server Jason was excellent along wit the rest of the staff. Absolutely delicious food all around. Now we need one in Tucson! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very New York vibe! Great food. Great happy hour drinks. Great music! Staff some of them are very friendly. Some of them have New York City attitudes. There is a good variety of food."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.   Loved the wine, mozzerella strips an Baked ziti.  Service was very friendly.  .  Atmosphere was unique and interesting."}
{"text":"So happy we came here. Wayne was a super attentive waiter. Eggplant rollatin appetizer was outstanding. Chicken parm was excellent perfectly cooked. Muscles prepared amazing. It was super. 

Wish they didn't cram everyone next to each other when seating guest in a fully open restaurant. Fyi all tables complained about it."}
{"text":"Tommy's is definitely one of our favorite spots in the valley. The staff is superb, friendly and knowledgable; and the owner is wonderful!
If you are looking for a great meal in the $20 range go for one of the daily specials...we've had many of them and have never been disappointed, except by the emptiness of our plates when we've finished licking them clean! Going here always leaves the most wonderful taste in our mouths, both literally and figuratively...thanks Tommy, keep up the great cooking!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I had classic spaghetti and meatballs and it was delicious and authentic."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, great food, friendly owner & staff...old school Italian family run, reminded me of back home in CT & NY! We ordered take-out to enjoy during an afternoon of football watching - great experience/atmosphere. Just moved into the neighborhood and will definitely be back to try Mama's Gravy."}
{"text":"Still my favorite. Hadn't been in awhile but took my daughter who was visiting from NY! Had an amazing Mediterranean salad,and of you want to treat yourself for dessert, I guarantee you've never had spumoni ice cream like this!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious and the service was equally awesome. I had a special that was cod wrapped in prosciutto and they let me sub the pasta for a gluten free linguini that wasn't on the menu.  Normally GF pasta isn't great, but this one as delish!  We'll def be back."}
{"text":"Started with the meatballs then Proceeded to the sausage and peppers sandwich ... DELICIOUS! 

Great service , great food ,  great ambiance ! 

Will be back !"}
{"text":"We saw it on our way to Chili's and thought it looked like a cool little place. When we got to Chili's and there were no tables, so we decided to head back to Tommy's. Thank god we did great little place to eat some delicious Italian food and have a beer. Being from NY, I try to find places like this to remind me of back home and this place does a great job. Tommy made sure to stop by our table, greet us and take our order. I highly recommend it and don't forget to get a Cannoli! Definitely going back to get a sandwich and a pizza for football Sunday!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Tommy's for the first time. Every single thing we ate was delicious. It has great ambiance and service. We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I live a half mile from Tommy's and didn't even know they were open.  They're web presence and social networking presence is almost nil and what there is is amateurish at best.  That said...

Visited Tommy's on Saturday night.  I like the look of the place, cozy bar.  Great deck. 
The Shrimp Balsamic crostino app was very good, loved it.  We decided to have the Prime Rib special.  A very good cut of beef, very flavorful,  though a little thin by most standards especially for the 17.00 price tag.  The seasonal vegetables were very fresh and tasty.  The redskin garlic mashed were a little disappointing, great texture, underwhelming garlic flavor.  The house salad w/ goat cheese was just ok, and had wayyyyy too much goat cheese.  I'm a fan but it was very heavy handed.

Visited again on Sunday for lunch and had the Tommy Burger.  A half pound charbroiled beast.  I mean that in a great way.  Loved it.  Though the onion straws on the burger were soggy.  Really dug the burger on the brioche.  I had seen the previous evening that sweet potato fries were on the menu and was looking forward to them with the burger...sadly they weren't good. Frozen...blech..c'mon guys...fresh is cheaper and tastes a hundred times better.  Do that, put them in a basket with some nice dipping sauces and you have the salty fried app your menu really needs for us beer drinkers."}
{"text":"The meatballs were so delicious and tender and the flavor of the cheese pizza was excellent. Our entrees were delicious and although we were stuffed, we decided to try their homemade tiramisu!! PURE HEAVEN!!!! Best I have ever had in my very long life and I am from Boston! If you have nothing else, you must try their Tiramisu!!!!"}
{"text":"Just opened. Had lunch today and everything was wonderful. Great pizza. Sport events on 9 tvs. Great atmosphere. Can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Food - great
Service - regular
Ambiance - different, eclectic

Worth trying. Don't judge book by its cover."}
{"text":"Place was awesome. Very surprised how great the food and atmosphere was. It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal here tonight- the meatball appetizer and spaghetti carbonara were simply delicious!  Tommy and John are always so warm and friendly, I feel like family whenever I stop by..."}
{"text":"Can I rate this place any HIGHER than five! What an amazing place! The food, hands down, best I've ever had! Meatballs are crazy amazing!! And as another plus, our waitress Rose Marie ( I think) was truly a plus to the experience! After that the owner came by. Truly, you can feel the love he has for the place! I am craving their food already and I just got home!!"}
{"text":"I got to choose where my friends would take me for a birthday dinner. MY MISTAKE!  We did have a nice table on the patio. Our waitress was horrible. We placed our drink order and the drinks came out one at a time....2 glasses of wine and a bottle of beer. I'm not sure what she was doing but it wasn't taking care of her customers. All 3 of us ordered the steak salad. The salads came ...romaine lettuce with with a few strips of steak. A few of the items that were listed on the menu for the salad were absent. We asked for rolls, she went to get them and after 15 minutes she came over to say the kitchen help burnt them. She went back in and came out with cold rolls in a bowl. By the end of our meal our original waitress was no longer around....she never said she was leaving. I wasn't upset she was gone but wished we would have started with someone else. The service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best. I would never go back again."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place last night looking for a new place for drinks. We quickly learned that this place has some great pizza too along with specialty cocktails. Tommy the owner asked us what we like on our pizza and went in the kitchen to make it. Some of the best restaurant pizza we've had in a long time. The cheese was fresh and the crust was light and crispy at the same time. We can't wait to go back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"We've gone twice now and we plan to make this a regular place. Both times our food has been great! We really like the atmosphere (cozy with fun jazz vibe), the menu (something for everyone!) and the staff (great service). Appetizers were spot on - calamari and the meatballs. The linguini with white wine clam sauce is done exactly the way I like it - all the right ratio of clams, garlic, sauce. My fiancé's go to dish is chicken fettuccine and this one exceeded his expectations. Plan to try their parmigiana dishes next time as I understand they are popular."}
{"text":"The food was very good here, portions were perfect. Not too big and not too small. Customer service was good, had to ask a couple for items, but they were polite. The ambience is nice but it is wayyyy too dark there. Went with my mother and she is older and had trouble reading the menu with just a tiny candle and her iPhone light."}
{"text":"Nice cozy neighborhood place to eat.  Has a neighborhood bar and grill feel to it .  Appetizers, meatballs and fried zucchini were amazing. Had the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken, was so good.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My family recently had a surprise party for me at Tommy's Place. I had been there a few times and the food was ok, nothing to gush about though. The servers were fantastic and we appreciated their stellar service. However, after the party I heard from my family and friends how awful they were treated by the manager the night of the party. It is unbelievably disappointing to hear how mean and disrespectful someone would be to their customers. There are better restaurants in the area that treat customers kindly - I will never return to this place and I know no one in our party would ever return there. What a horrible experience. Shame on the manager for being such a nasty person."}
{"text":"Went to a privately scheduled surprise party being held upstairs.  I had not been here since it has changed ownership and had a redesign of the interior.  Great ambiance, nice decor. The food was decent- not bad, not remarkable.  The wait staff was excellent- very nice and attentive.  Of particular note was Kendra the bartender- she was top notch and deserved every bit of the extra tip that we left her.

Where things fell apart was at the end. The owner showed up while the bill was being settled. He was very rude and demanding and even overcharged the party organizers.  Based on his interaction alone, I will never return to this establishment and will advise all of my friends not to as well.  It's a shame that a bad owner would ruin an otherwise pleasant experience and sully the efforts of his great staff."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in the valley. The atmosphere is intimate & the staff is attentive. The food is delicious. My favorites include the carbonara, bolognese, chicken parmesan & pizza. Their meatballs are amazing as well. Don't forget their drinks (my favorites are the sangria, mediterranean mule & Chianti wine)."}
{"text":"THE HYPE IS REAL!! Eat here!! 10/10 would recommend. 
We showed up and at first they asked us if we had a reservation because they were completely full inside for the night. We weren't aware reservations needed to be made, but we soon found out why.
Tommy, the owner, was more than accommodating to us and gladly sat us outside on their patio, which was completely fine with us.
The entire staff here is completely attentive and they were all soooo nice. Constantly asking if we need anything, if our food was ok, making sure our drinks were full. 
The food was absolutely amazing and reasonably priced. This place has the upscale feel with upscale food but yet was perfectly priced.
We will definitely be making this a regular go-to spot for weekend meals. 
Thanks for everything, Tommy! Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome great service great food great atmosphere the environment is just flat out awesome"}
{"text":"Great people! Went in for lunch and got to meet Tommy!!! After reading the reviews I went with the meatball appetizer and ceaser salad. Just enough and tasted fresh. Tommy told me himself they use veil, beef, grated cheese, garlic and parsley. He also told me the pizzas are really good."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our evening.  Live music was a nice treat, so rare these days and it starts at 6 every Friday & Saturday.
We sat at the bar, had cocktails and dinner.  The decor is so nice, has that rustic feel.  Bartender was very tentative, drinks were excellent.
Appetizer was that gooey cheese and arugula with crostini, excellent, and we shared the bistca steak over pasta. Wonderful!
We will definitely be going back!
Thanks Tommy 

PS. The place is small so get there early!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved into the neighborhood.  We noticed Tommy's Place open a couple of weeks ago.  We walked in and immediately enjoyed the atmosphere.  We were approached by a server quickly.  I order the chicken parmigiana and my husband had the turkey & provolone cold sub.  We both enjoyed our meals immensely.  The portions were good but not overload.  The service was excellent & friendly.  We will definitely be returning as it is great to have a local Italian place to enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is the worst costumer service I have ever experienced. It was 11:10 I called to place a order since I live around the block, joe answered and said they were closed, when online it says they close at11:45pm. When I asked why he answered the phone he just hung up on me. I called back and he answered and then hung up on me. Don't go eat here!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I walked into Tommy's Place today 12-26-12 at around 11:20am and I found a hidden gem.  I passed by this place numerous times on my way to market but it never enticed me.  I gave it a try today as I was walking by and found a cozy place where I can sit down and have a drink and eat some old style american/Italian food.  As I sat down I was greeted by the bartender who introduced herself as Beth. I immediately felt welcome. I then sat at there old style bar nestled in a warm atmosphere. I really felt comfortable talking to the staff.  The owner Tommy walked in and greeted me as well as if I was a regular.  It was a nice place to just relax and have some food and drinks. I will definitely become a regular.  A great hidden gem."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp when another place wasn't open. I've been in this building before when it was other venues in past. Nice new decor. Food was excellent but overpriced which is the only reason for 3 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Italian!!  Cozy atmosphere and live dinner music. Couldn't ask for more, thanks Roe!"}
{"text":"I have to say the food was really good...BUT the owner Tommy was so incredibly rude to his employees it was sickening to listen to him berate them in front of patrons. The bartender was doing a great job, made the best martini I have ever had, but Tommy was breathing down her neck the whole time pacing behind the bar and questioning every move she made. Last week we decided to give Tommy's another try and saw the female bartender pulled aside and returning just about in tears. He cusses at staff and you can hear it through the small bar area. I decided to write this review a week later because the sad situation stayed with me and I have been in the restaurant business for over 40 years. I would NEVER treat my employees as poorly as witnessed him treating them. Turnover will be costly."}
{"text":"Very homey and comfortable... built into a Century home! great food, very friendly service (pretty sure the owners were also serving us)... always great jams playing and good specials throughout the week... I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great experience from start to finish.  The minestrone soup was truly homemade and yummy. The lemon sole was delicious. The dessert, the rum cake my favorite, tiramisu and spumoni, authentic and cappuccino OMG! For me this was total comfort food exactly like how I remember living in NY, eating at home. So happy to have found an Italian place that is truly authentic. Met Tommy Morano, the owner - so genuine to see him greet the guests like we're in his home. Being first generation Italian-American, I highly recommended this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well, great potential if you know the secret handshake. 
First. The 2 of us asked for the table in the corner instead of the banquet bench seat crammed between tables. We were told no, it was reserved as a 4 top. Twenty minutes later a man came in alone and sat there. Ten minutes later his guest arrived. Two people at a 4 top. It was explained he was a regular. We watched the 4 top behind us sit empty for our entire meal.  One hour and 45 min. 
We had mussels for an appetizer. The description  said it came with garlic bread.  It was grilled bread. Not a huge deal, but not as described in the menu either. I ordered the nightly special eggplant parm stacked w chicken and prosciutto. My husband ordered the tilapia and asked for vegetables instead of pasta. It was an up charge. No big deal. I asked if the chicken would be delicious and not going to be dry. Ann our server said the chef was a perfectionist. And everyone was held accountable. The chicken was dry. Not the best experience in a \"5 Star\" restaurant, owned by the previous owner of 31 previously successful restaurants\". 
It was really hard being paying customers yet second class guests. We decided we'd try again and learn the secret handshake. Will update our review next time...."}
{"text":"The Alfredo is amazing. Wonderful service, great quality. Fun little spot to go for great Italian food, great date spot, the décor is fun to look at. Just a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"Went with 3 guys who were in Phoenix for a gold weekend. 
Food and service were excellent. Reasonable prices and a great evening. Smaller place, we had no reservation but were lucky to get seated
 Suggest a reservation 

Ceasar salad was good. Pasta with sausage and pasta with meatballs bit very tasty 

We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!!! Don't let the location fool you. Walk inside and be transported to NYC ... not current NYC but the Frank Sinatra NYC era.  Not only is the food literally the best but it's not $$$$$. We get the Sicilian pizza and it's enough to feed 6 peeps. Easy! The apps are fab. The drinks are fab. Service... excellency!!!! I would love to try the desserts but we are always too full"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Just had the seafood combo.  Shrimp scallops clams mussels calamari in a red sauce over perfectly cooked angel hair. Heaven. Gonna send twenty bucks to the chef.  That good"}
{"text":"Four stars only because it was our 1st time there.  As a  NY-er it was awesome to find a place that made NY style pizza ...no joke. The food at Tommys place is comparable to pizzerias in my hometown in NY.  Definitely one of my new go-to spots."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and great service! The atmosphere was great- decorated with NYC pictures it felt like we were in Little Italy, but cozier! Anthony, our server, was very attentive and friendly, and Tommy stopped by several times to check on us as well. The food was perfect- we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My Mom suggested Tommy's Place for a dinner date for her and my Dad with my man and I. Double date with the parents! I was blown away by the food at this place. Not too expensive and very tasty Italian. I'd say this stuff is pretty damn authentic! The waiter, C.E., was a cool cat who took good care of us and made our experience that much better. The bread the serve with your meal is so great and the Chicken Marsala. Holyyy. Worth a taste, for sure. We were there on a Saturday and it filled up for the live music and good food. Worth making a reservation. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant and we were not disappointed.   The restaurant has limited tables, which we are able to grab one. Marley Taylors Band was playing and the music was fantastic.We had the usual Italian food, Lasagne, Baked ziti,the bread was served in 3 pieces and was hard . There are pictures everywhere of New York, Chicago,and tvs thats the only experience  i didnt care for .I dont think tvs belong in restaurants, bars yes. Took away from the ambience.  Yes we will be back
Thank you"}
{"text":"Tommy's Place is delicious!!! I always stop by for the specials. Way to go Tommy. Love the food and the atmosphere!!!  The chicken picata is my thing."}
{"text":"Come on by to indulge Italian food made right and the perfect ambiance to compliment it. I opted for their TNT sandwich. It was created perfectly with flavor throughout each bite all loaded into a fresh roll. The food was only out performed by their service. Very attentive service where my tea was filled often without asking."}
{"text":"Good service, great atmosphere. The food was excellent. Nice beer and wine selection. The tiramisu should be illegal as it is so good. The owner checked on as a couple of times to make sure everything was OK. Will go back soon. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am so glad that we found a place close to home that has a good atmosphere, amazing food with professional and excellent staff!  We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"What a gem on Bell Rd! Great food.. great atmosphere! Anthony was awesome! We went for lunch then brought kids back for dinner!"}
{"text":"After passing by here many times, I finally.swung in with my wife for our anniversary.  The environment inside is wonderful and the wait  staff was very friendly.    My wife got Salmon and I got shrimp scampi. Food was pretty good, although I've had better.  Overall I would  definitely come back.  The happy hour menu seemed good and like I said, the environment is very relaxing."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. We LOVED the previous restaurant in this location and were sorry to see this location close. SO glad we stopped in tonight. Tommy, the namesake was there and spoke with all the customers as well as surprising us with an AMAZING salad. Diana was our waitress and she was great. If she didn't know the answer to a question, she took the time to find out. Shared pizza and chicken parmigiana - both were great!  We WILL be back and recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Tommy's is excellent! It makes me feel like I'm somewhere in Manhattan. Their antipasto salad is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is our go to nice restaurant to take family to when they are in town. Good portions, reasonably priced, and fantastic service! You can feel the pride in service when you come here. They were also very accommodating when we came in without a reservation on a busy Saturday evening and had someone with special seating needs to boot. Will definitely keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I have only gone once when on vacation to visit my family in Phoenix and I only ordered To Go but I was still very impressed with the service and food. I got Fetuccine Alfredo to go and it was pretty good! A little too much onion for my taste but the food was quality for sure. The owner helped me out right away even though I went on New Years Eve and the place was packed! Would return when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"It was my wife's and my first time at Tommy's and what a great find! I'm part Italian and this has been the best Italian food we've had in the 12 years we've been in Arizona. We will come back again for sure, most likely with friends."}
{"text":"Went here for a late Sunday dinner. Was not disappointed. Had the Sunday dinner special, , Mammas Italian sauce with meatballs, sausage and bred braziole served over rigatoni. What a pleasant surprise. Everything was delicious. Reminded me of back home in New York. Everyone was very fry friendly and courteous.Tommy even greeted you as you entered the restaurant. The decor reminded me of the great places back home. As a native New Yorker this place definitely has captured the essence of fine  Italian cuisine.
I will definitely come back and bring the family. Our server, Elena, couldn't have been more gracious and thanks for your dinner recommendations."}
{"text":"We have been to Tommy's Place twice, both times the service was was great and the food is wonderful. This last time we went my hubby and I are on a very strict meal plan working with our naturopath. The waitress was so kind, answered all my questions and ensured our food was as we needed it. The food came out in a very timely manner, everything looked amazing. Their grilled chicken is awesome! I can't wait to go back when I can eat a little more freely. The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxing, a great place to hang out and visit with family and friends."}
{"text":"M said I had to go here so off we went. Real easy to miss the parking entrance. Parking is a little tight. Greeted warmly at the door No reservation, no problem, but I could see it getting booked up. I had looked on their website and did not see a link or specific note that they accept reservations. We were seated right away. I just had iced tea M had a cocktail suggested by our waiter that she liked. We had an order of garlic toast. M had a crab ravioli that was good and I had a side salad and Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken which was very good. The only let down for me was the Tiramisu we shared but M said it was great. All the employees we came in contact with were very good. For my taste I thought  the dining room was a bit dark and cramped. I would certainly go back again."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Make sure you try the meatballs.  Jillian is a fantastic bartender and you can usually find Tommy speaking with the guests."}
{"text":"Could not have asked for a better experience, the customer service,  the music, the atmosphere, and of course the food was delicious! I love supporting locally owned and operated businesses for their hospitality but this place went above and beyond. When the owner himself makes sure you are well taken care of and serves the customers you know you've found a gem in town!"}
{"text":"This trendy new spot is worth taking a look at. The clams appetizer was warm and full of clams of great price and some dipping bread. The price a salad although a little pricey was pretty good. The linguine and white clam dinner was excellent. The eggplant parmesan sandwich was outstanding. All the meals are homemade and taste wonderful."}
{"text":"We order from Tommys a few times a month for several months now and EVERY SINGLE TIME is amazing! The portion sizes vary (we always order the same thing) but it's always enough and so so good. I want to try other items but the spaghetti and meatballs is so freaking good! The sauce is incredible! I highly recommend this place !! The staff is also great! Super sweet guys that make you feel like family."}
{"text":"Ordered the Rigatoni Bolognese, had a sausage added. Based on the reviews, expected much more.    Picked this place solely on the reviews. Food was average - nothing special. Bread had no flavor. Meh - average. 

Also was seated upstairs, which had to have been the most under lit seating I ever experienced. Needed to use IPhone lighting. 

One item I found unsafe was the emergency exit was blocked by a table with 4 chairs. This was the only exit aside from the stairs going up. See photo. Very dangerous. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I want to start this review by saying that this is probably the only time I would rate a restaurant with 2 stars and still go back to try it. I have so many great things to say about this place but was very underwhelmed with our actual experience. 

Let me start with the positives. First of all, the restaurant is beautiful. The decor is nice, the atmosphere is great and it is a place that I would want to spend a nice evening at. On Fridays and Saturdays, starting at 6pm, there is live music and we were treated to a great trumpet player through our meal. I also thought that the patio would be a great place to hang out during a happy hour and there were 6 or 7 dishes to choose from for $5 and drinks were very affordable too. 

So here's where things went wrong: 

First, our server was awful. She didn't know the menu, she didn't know that happy hour existed, she didn't know the specials, how to pronounce the food that was being served, and she didn't belong in that restaurant. She was wearing a gallon of perfume that made our entire section smell, and she brought out food that we didn't order. 

Next, the food we got was just okay. Since we only had happy hour things, I don't want to judge too much (especially since the dishes coming out around us looked excellent). First we started with the fried Burratta. This was a great appetizer EXCEPT, our dish wasn't served with the toast so we didn't have anything to spread the cheese on. When the table next to us ordered the same thing, they got the pieces of toast so we know the dish was a bit inconsistent for our table. Next, we had the meatball sliders: I thought that the meatball was tasty and the sauce was good too, BUT, the bread was soggy and fell apart, AND there was NO CHEESE on the sliders which would have been a VERY welcome addition. After the sliders we had the \"Italian Fries\" and an order of Calamari with Fra Diavolo on the side. The calamari was perfect. It was fried perfectly, the sauce was delicious and I wouldn't have changed a thing about it. The fries on the other hand were very weak and out of place. Let me explain. This is an \"upscale\" Italian restaurant and everything was served beautifully, EXCEPT the fries which came out in a plastic red basket with some ketchup on the side. The only thing \"italian\" about these fries was a little bit of minced garlic tossed in. These fries were something you could get at any burger joint, and were totally uninspired and served in a way that you wouldn't expect to see in a nice restaurant. 

Lastly, we finished with an order of Tiramisu. I thought this was pretty good, but again, three of us were splitting the dessert and she only brought out 2 plates (but 3 spoons). 

I think this place has tons of potential. Maybe being a new restaurant there are some kinks to work out OR maybe we just hit an off-night. Although I am not giving this place a great rating, I really would come back and I would give them another chance because the food around us looked (and smelled) excellent and the vibe of the restaurant was great."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very good meal here 2 nights ago. We were seated promptly, had great service and the food was very tasty."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to checking this place out but was pretty disappointed in the food.  The bruschetta got really soggy and could have been more creative.  I also had the calamari, which was eh.  I only had some appetizers and wine so maybe the entrees are better but I probably won't come back to check it out."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday with my daugter, dad and brother. Didnt expect it to look as nice as it did. Great for a meal or just a drink. Loved the atmosphere. Nice bar area. We will be back."}
{"text":"We had the bruschetta, penne bolognese, baked ziti and cannoli.  The restaurant's atmosphere and decor is really nice.  The food was good not spectacular but good.  The taste of the bruschetta was good however the bread was soggy. A good local Italian bread would have made it really good.  Favors and texture of ziti dishes were good. The best part was the cannoli.... great filing and great crunchy shell.  Is it the best Italian food around no but I think it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Such a amazing Italian restaurant. Amazing service, awesome food and just a great atmosphere. Highly recommend stopping by!"}
{"text":"Tommy's Place is in an odd area off of Bell but I'm definitely happy I tried it. The happy hour was pretty tasty- we had practically everything on the happy hour menu. My fave items were the shrimp, the stuffed mushrooms and the bacon wrapped dates. We sat at the bar so we didn't see the rest of the restaurant but I thought the atmosphere was fine and service was good."}
{"text":"This was our second time here for a family celebration. All of the diners said this was the best they have ever had! We will definitely be back to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for lunch on 6/22. It was our first time here and like many others, we saw the amazing Yelp reviews, so decided to try it out. It seems to be one of those small, intimate, everyone knows who you are type of places. When we walked in it wasn't too busy and every head turned to look at us when we entered. We sat at a table and ordered 2 glasses of wine, my husband ordered the meatball sub, per the recommendation of who I believe was the owner? My husband was debating between meatballs or eggplant. I ordered the TNT sub with the mayo and dressing on the side. Both sandwiches came with fries. My sandwich had the mayo on it and on the side. Not a huge deal just meant the hubby couldn't try it, he can't do mayo. The food was really good, and my husband really enjoyed the meatballs, the only thing I could think of to make my sandwich even better, would be to offer or serve it with a side of giardiniera! We're from the East Coast, MA and RI, it's really hard to find really good authentic Italian Food that we are used to eating. I'm a little disappointed in the service. We really wanted a Canoli, and were also contemplating tiramisu (my husband's favorite) but we were never given the opportunity to order any. The male server came over with our bill, handed it to my husband and said, I'll take that when you're ready. Then he literally stood there and waited for my husband to pay it. Could I have asked to order dessert? Sure. But honestly, from the start, it felt as if we were outsiders and didn't feel very welcome. Small talk was being made at every table but ours. I wasn't about to ask if we could order dessert, the waiter made it seem like he was ready for us to leave, so we did. The food is top notch, but I'm not sure I care to come back."}
{"text":"The place have an eclectic decor and it has an inviting feel.  After that it's all down hill.  They're severely understaffed and drinks and food were slow.  The waitress apologized over and over.  A busy kitchen and slow food isn't the problem.  It's the wait staff staying away until they have something to bring.  So besides us most of the tables had empty drinks and no wait staff in site.  That's still not the worst part.  Instead of Farm to Table...... this place is Frozen to Table.  The meatballs are frozen processed garbage that were inedible.  Don't call yourself New York Italian. There's nothing New York about this place.  The place was packed and they should invest in a better quality of food.  Fresh meatballs and sausage is not too much to ask for.  This place is no better than Olive Garden.  Which by the way I wouldn't eat at with a borrowed tongue."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in north Phoenix not having a clue as to where we could fond a non franchise, non fast food place for Sunday lunch. Yelp ratings took us to Tommy's. Nice, fresh and clean atmosphere including the men's restroom. My wife had the fettuccine Alfredo that was very tasty with plenty of cream Italian ham. I had the Sunday special \"Mama's Gravy\" which was a couple of very good sized meatballs and an Italian sausage that was perfectly cooked with a tomato/Marinara sauce that was very flavorful. I also had the Tuscan soup as an appetizer that was really nicely made with attractively fresh ingredients. Nice cutlery and glassware. However I was disappointed with cheesy paper napkins in such a nice place. I strongly recommend that they use white or black linen from now on. Our server, Tommy, Jr. was very professional and attentive. We also had the chance to meet \"Uncle John\" and Tommy, Sr. himself who indicated that he's owned/operated 19 restaurants! Wow! Clearly he knows what he's up to. The place has a nice \"good fellas\" feel and would probably be a great \"drinks then dinner\" place. We'll have to come back."}
{"text":"Peg and I tried Tommy's Place a couple Saturdays ago and we were certainly not disappointed.  We got there early on a Saturday night and the place was jumping already.  They squeeze in as many tables as they can, but Joe found us a good spot.  We went very old school Italian from Mozzarella sticks and Calamari to Chicken Parm and Manicotti.  We even had Spumoni for dessert.  Everything was delicious!  Service was attentive, suggestions were great.  Management stopped a couple times to make sure our every wish was fulfilled.  You really feel like you stepping back in time a bit and into another world at Tommy's ...even down to the live jazz sax playing next to the bar.  We are certainly looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Eat here. Tommy's is just the place you need to be! Possibly the only place in town at which you'd want to become a regular. Trust the specials, savor the desert and enjoy great service. John our server takes great care of us every time. Eat here."}
{"text":"In this, The Information Age, it is rare to come across a legitimate place of business that operates completely off the grid.  I would expect that owners, managers, and those with a vested interest in the opening of a new restaurant would have the foresight to spread the word out in The Cloud.  I would suspect that a few zealous restaurateurs may have gone so far as to ghostwrite a few ultra-positive reviews just to get some buzz going.  I have been trying for weeks to find some trace of Tommy's Barbecue online, and I can't find any evidence that this place even exists!  Ultimately, I decided to drive past there tonight to make sure it is, in fact, a real place.  While I was there, I figured I would jot down the address and do my part to help promote this top-secret Rocky River establishment.

Formerly Treats Tea Room, Tommy's is located in a converted townhouse.  This creates a quaint and cozy atmosphere.  With tasteful decorations, dim lighting, and ambient music, it is not your typical barbecue joint - I didn't see any wet-naps or paper tablecloths anywhere.  

The service was a bit sketchy, but when I was there they had only been open for a couple weeks.  They were out of a few things, some of the beers and wines on the menu did not match what they actually had, and our server was not very helpful or knowledgeable.  I would think this would improve over time.

Overall, the food was average.  They offer big burgers, hand cut sweet potato fries, pulled pork, onion straws, and other traditional barbecue fare.  They have a blue cheese coleslaw that was interesting, and they serve some creative barbecue sauces.  I had the ribs, but I was a bit disappointed - when they say Dry Rub, they aren't kidding!  By far, the highlight of the meal was the appetizer.  

We ordered the Chorizo Stuffed Banana Peppers for the table.  After everyone took a small bite, I soon found the whole plate in front of me.  Based on how quickly everyone passed on the dish, I'm thinking someone pulled a Folger's switch and substituted Hungarian Hot Peppers for the milder Banana Peppers listed on the menu.  In my opinion, they were good 'til the last drop of sweat was wiped from my brow!  My advice to people who pick this dish: Be prepared for the possibility of pungent pepper piquancy!

All things considered, I would definitely give Tommy's another try.  They have a great location and some unique ideas, and once they refine their methods a bit they could easily make it into the regular rotation."}
{"text":"What a very pleasant surprise! The return of a great neighborhood Italian Restaurant. The restaurant has great decor/ambience. The food was phenomenal  and Tommy was the perfect waiter. He is the owners son."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful restaurant! 
I've dined-in and ordered takeout and everything I've tried is delicious. Always exceeding our expectations. We interacted with most of the staff and they are wonderful and make every visit that much better. 
The experience of being at this Italian restaurant and the ambiance can't be beat for me and my husband."}
{"text":"Tried this place for NYE. Excellent atmosphere and would love to return if it were closer to our house. The owner greeted everyone seemed like. I just wish it didn't feel so crammed upstairs. But it was a holiday so understandable."}
{"text":"Wow what an absolutely unique place! Being European brings me warm thoughts. I love places like this!!! Amazing service! Art everywhere! Food is awesome! Came here for lunch watched a soccer game and had one of their specials, My taste buds are smiling!!! Definitely going to tell others to experience this place as well."}
{"text":"We came in tonight on a whim and all I can say is 'wow.'  

I am too full to type much, but let's just say you can't go wrong with whatever you order.  Lovely antipasto plate, yummy pizzas, tender meatballs, tasty garlic bread, best eggplant parmigiana ever, ravioli with vodka sauce to die for, and a homemade pappardella with shrimp in a brandy cream sauce that was decadent.

The owner and staff are very personable and the ambience is charming as well."}
{"text":"My hubby and I decided to try this place tonight and I'm so glad we did! We were promptly greeted and told to chose a table. The staff was all so friendly and welcoming. We had the zucchini appetizer which was cooked to perfection. We shared a chicken Parmesan with fettuccini alfredo for our pasta. It was so yummy and just the right portion when we shared the entree. We had a couple of cocktails and shared the chocolate cake for dessert. It's a lovely surprise along Bell Road and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would have passed this joint by but reviews on yelp convinced me to give it a shot. Great italian place!  Meatballs and salads great, as well as pizza. We all ate too much but pain was worth it. Service staff was spot-on even though we arrived at 3:00 when they were ramping up for dinner crows. Great ambiance too."}
{"text":"We came to this place on yelps search and glad we chose this. Although it suppose to be by reservations only they were able to seat us - party of five. The food was excellent. We had the calzone, spaghetti, the lasagna and steak sandwich. We did not have any left over it was so good. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to another restaurant but didn't even get acknowledged!!! So decided to try Tommy's Place and is absolutely wonderful!!! Wine, appetizer, entree, dessert all fabulous. Not super big, just the right size. Rat pack style music in the background. Decor is fresh and modern. There is full bar on one side with seating on the other, TV's if you want to watch, several different channels with no volume. Had the shrimp with lemon butter sauce and angel hair pasta special....yummy!!! Will add this restaurant to my list of favorites!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good. My partner got the seafood combo and I had the spaghetti bolognese. It was so good. I was so full but I ate it all anyways. She left with extra, it was that much food. The sangria the bartender offered us was on point. Full of fruits and spirits. It was a pleasant dining experience. 

The bartender said usually the place has live music but that it was pretty dead for a Tuesday night. So if you're looking to enjoy this place on a quiet night ...then Tuesday is for you.

Also! Try the mini cannoli. It's so yummy."}
{"text":"Love this place. My mouth is already watering with thoughts of tonight's dinner. I do not write many reviews, so when I do, it is well deserved. My husband and I have been here at least a dozen times. We tend to be creatures of habit, so order the same food a lot. My H loves the clams in white sauce. They use the real clams in the shells, and he says they are the best. I usually get either the Penne Vodka which is possibly the best I have had. I also love the Ceasar salad with shrimp. For an appetizer get the fried zucchini, and you won't be disappointed. The owners along with the staff are so nice, and engage with the diners. The music on Fridays and Saturdays is top notch and perfect for this restaurant setting. Taking friends for the first time tonight, and can't wait to see what they think. We are all New Yorkers, and this place feels like \"home\"."}
{"text":"Keep trying to like the place but leave disappointed EVERY time.  Nice deck but the food is so BLAH!  Salsa is bad jar salsa and everything I've eaten tastes fresh from the shelves of Save-A-Lot!  

If they could put some love into their food, I could see this place being a destination.  Others share my sentiment and done trying to like Tommys."}
{"text":"Come here! Every time I come here it gets better. It's cozy and welcoming. The owner is usually here and greets me every visit. Pizza is great, the Cannolis are better. But the Antipasto Salad is something from heaven above. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying that if not for the owner and our server this review was headed in a different direction!  It kind of started with my 9 year old son wanting wings for lunch.  I had remembered reading a couple of good reviews about the wings here at Tommy's Place so we decided to head over.  We walked in and we were greeted promptly and escorted to our table.  The place was very welcoming and we were readying ourselves for the wings.  Looked at the menu and decided on a order of wings as well as an order of fried calamari, at which time our server informed us that because it was football season the price of the wings were $4.00 more than the 10.99 marked in the Menu.  Let's just say the review could have ended there with one, two stars at best.  However my wife said let's go ahead and get some lunch.  I said ok and we ordered.  I ordered a Stromboli and asked if I could get some plain spaghetti with simply some olive oil butter and parmigiana cheese and maybe a a little cracked pepper.  The owner said he eats it that way as well and made it for me.  My wife had the ziti and my son the pizza.  The owner delivered my pasta an said this is how I like it and gave me the bowl.  I tasted it, added a little pepper and salt and let me tell you it was in the top five pastas I have ever eaten.  I tasted my wife's Baked Ziti and my sons pizza and they were both great as well.  I spoke with the owner on many occasions during this meal and other than the wings this experience was outstanding.  Wait did I mention the spumoni ice cream desert.  I have not had better.  Come to fine out he has it shipped in from Italy.  Wow what a meal!  Thanks guys we will be back.  Hopefully we can try the wings when they come back to their Scenes in that area.  But until then keep it up.  There have been at least 4 restaurants in this building and you are by far the best Italian in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food I've ever had here in Phoenix. The service we had here was phenomenal, the food was amazing hand made pasta which is so lite and airy. You don't get that heavy feeling after eating the pasta. Absolutely an amazing place!"}
{"text":"What a hidden little gem! I drive past Tommy's every day for work and my dad finally brought me in for dinner. I ordered the Parmesan chicken with vodka sauce and angel hair pasta. Our waitress was very nice and helpful, answered all my questions and had no problem with substitutions. Everything about the dish was delicious and perfect! The table also got a plate of seasoned bread which was a perfect tool to wipe up my extra sauce with. 

Tommy is great host and walked around to all of the tables checking on us. You don't get that kind of service at companies like Olive Garden. Wonderful experience with exquisite food. Will be back soon, I'm already thinking about what to try next!"}
{"text":"Great service, awesome food!  Lively entertainment as well. A+
This place has just been opened for 5 weeks at the point we went there.  I specifically chose it for the affordable clambake they offered.  What a wonderful sweetest day it was.  The server was attentive but not intrusive, the live entertainment was spirited, loungy, and interactive with the crowd, and the owner was genuinly interested in our experience and hanging out in the bar and dining room.   Clam chowder was delicious as a first course, a dozen middlneck clambs were the second course.  Not fishy one bit, no grit, and tender.  Thirdly was half a fryer chicken corn on the cob and rosemary redskin potatoes.  The chicken was baked first and then steamed in the clam broth, a flavor I look for with a chicken clambake.  My buddy had the pulled pork sandwich.  Tender pork, BBQ sauce that wasnt too sweet, and a nice pile of onion straws topping off, served on a chibatta bread. 
Atmosphere of a converted townhouse was cozy and personal.  They have a beautiful deck on the back.  Parking is a bit sparse, but there are plenty of areas nearby to accomidate you.
We need to support places like this, they are few and far between."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try because it had 5 stars, but we encountered a not very polite owner and staff.  It seemed like we were bothering them when we brought in their largest table of the afternoon and that was only 5 people!  After that, the tap water somehow tasted even worse than Phoenix tap water.  The food was fair, but nothing special compared to the other Italian restaurants nearby.  All of that and the prices seemed a bit higher than 2 $, it should probably be listed as 3."}
{"text":"This place was a lucky find, but I'm very glad I gave it a chance. Some of the best Italian food I've ever had! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Met Tommy one day at my favorite restaurant, Richardson's, and he told us about his restaurant so we went a couple of days later.  It is fabulous, best Italian I have ever had and I've been on the road for 30 years traveling all over the country.  Nice little patio where we are able to bring our dog.  Staff is amazing: Tanya, John, Tommy JR and Anthony.  Tommy Sr is a fun personality that's never too busy to stop, visit and have a drink with us."}
{"text":"From the outside, I thought this place was just another sports bar. I was very pleasantly surprised to find an amazing Italian menu, a decent (though short) wine list, and very interesting and friendly staff. The owner really is called Tommy, and he really is from New York. He's a super nice guy, and interested in making sure your experience is pleasant and memorable.

We had the seafood combo, and it was fresh and delicious. Very tasty! We also had the cannoli for dessert, and it was crispy, not too fatty, and just the right amount of sweet. Yum!

What was cool is that we still got to watch the game, but we weren't surrounded by sweaty people eating hamburgers. Not that there's anything wrong with sweaty people eating hamburgers, but if that's not the ambience you're looking for, this is a great alternative!

Oh yeah, they have outside seating and a cool window seating area too."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The spaghetti and meatballs were out of this world! The sauce was some of the best sauce I've ever tasted! Really delicious. The tiramisu was just okay. It was a little too bitter/coffee-y for me. Great restaurant for the north Phoenix area. Highly recommend for a date night. Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Just wonderful!   Tommy JR was our server and he was just awesome.  Never smothered the table but took care of us.  Food was very good but that cannoli, it was to die for.   After our great meal we sat at the bar and had some drinks and Conner took care of us.  He was awesome too!  Super friendly and from Chicago( like my friend and I)!!  I just highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The best food, staff and atmosphere for a quaint neighborhood restaurant. The owner Tommy and his cousin John are friendly attentive and offer excellent specials with a flare, they are very accommodating. The music last night was just right to add to the mood. We have dubbed this our favorite place and reservations are a must for dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade Italian food. Great service, affordable, very cozy atmosphere. Try the Alfredo or calzone"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was delicious and you can't go wrong with the ambiance!!  Incredible place!!"}
{"text":"Tommy has done a great job with the place! Food is fantastic and tiramasu is fresh and to die for! Great wine list and the bar is beautiful! Staff is on point and knowledgeable. Great atmosphere, pictures of new york and sounds of Frank Sinatra in the background create an awesome vibe!"}
{"text":"Great service, good food, really cool ambiance. REAL New Yorkers. Watched the Yankees game, had the spaghetti carbonara. Delicious."}
{"text":"Love love love love this place , came in for our first time and def will be back again. The pasta selection is awesome and this by far is the closet thing to pasta like in Chicago . The cannoli was literally the best one in Arizona so far . Wasn't disappointed and there is no way this place can disappoint . So many flavors and great service !"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. I went on a hunch because of yelp reviews which can sometimes be skewed. I'm Italian and I know good stuff and I'm very particular when it comes to sauce etc; The lasagna was delicious not to mention the eggplant rollatini on the daily app menu  was fantastic. I will surely be going back. It's nice to know I can get good Italian in the neighborhood for once. I read a review on Anzio's that it was so great and went there, most awful Italian I've ever had."}
{"text":"Our favorite  place, we love the food, it's excellent. Jesse Mcguire plays amaxing trumpet/lounge  music. Love  love Love Tommy!! Service is great, staff very attentive!"}
{"text":"Dom Pepe's of the southwest and all the New Yorkers out there know what I mean! I urge you to try the seafood combo and a white pizza. The portions are generous and Tommy brought all his recipes from his old restaurants. Cappricio's .... New York's best and more

Tommy will wow you with his personality and his food great experience we will be back for more!"}
{"text":"WOW- I ordered a carry out on Sunday of \"Mama's Sauce\" . It was a wonderful pasta meal. .There was a big Italian sausage  and 2 or 3 big meat balls( best meat balls I have ever had).

 The sauce was wonderful as well. It came with some garlic bread.

 I thought it was a little pricey but I got 6 meals out of 2 orders. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a down home sauce and wonderful meat balls,"}
{"text":"We have been twice since our 1st visit. Meatballs are a must as they are they perfectly flavored and melt in your mouth. My fav main dish is the the amazingly accomplished shrimp fettuccine. Many places just add a gob of butter and lemon and serve a mess. Tommys Salute to your smooth sauce and perfectly cooked shrimp.  Finally a place that cares if you come and enjoy. The staff is great from the time you enter to when you leave. \"Come again\" they say. Thank you, we will!"}
{"text":"First off, it is hard to find info on this place, but here is their own website, don't use the one Yelp lists -http://tommysplacerr.com/
We went in the late summer and sat on the patio during the week - for dinner. It was very relaxing, wait staff was great, food average. The atmosphere on the patio made it enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite until they mistakenly told me that I could walk in at 6 without reservation. The male host was extremely rude in telling me \"trust me it's not like I don't want to seat you.\" When I told him I called ahead and was informed to just walk in, he said he wasn't sure who told me that but was unwilling to apologize or find out who. Not a great service you would expect at such a top notch place."}
{"text":"Tommy's was amazing! Service was great and the food was perfect! Would eat here again without hesitation."}
{"text":"Discovered this restaurant on yelp. Food was outstanding. Service was fantastic. New York style atmosphere. Definitely going to be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Very sorry to say that I've never eaten here and never will. The owner is totally rude. Turned our business away. Asked us if we had a reservation on a Tuesday night with plenty of empty tables in sight and when we told him no he was a bit snarky and said the wait was about 30 min. They may have in fact been on a wait or had reservations for those empty tables we saw but it's not what you say it is how you say it. I kinda figured he was the owner because everything about him screamed entitled and over bearing. It's a shame because the menu looked half decent and we live close by but we will stick with Casey's across the street for our regular Tuesday dinner. Seemed as if they were under staffed as well."}
{"text":"Popped in here because we wanted to go to a restaurant near our daughter's house. The Sunday sauce is Yum-O! Meatballs made with love. The TNT sandwich is dyno-mite!!!! Portions generous. Staff couldn't have been nicer or more attentive! If you haven't been here you gotta go! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A strong three. This is pretty close to my place, and it's as cozy as you'd expect a former house to be. I especially like the bar area, which is largely in a former porch. It's a nice neighborhood joint. Solid choices on tap and in bottles. The menu is pretty basic, featuring lots of burgers and sandwiches. This is a good thing, as I think the kitchen sticks to their strengths. Simple is good. My husband and I both enjoyed different Lake Erie fish special as part of a special lent menu (cause even godless heathens like fish). My mashed redskins were a bit gluey (happens to me at home sometimes too), but the vegetables and fish were excellent. I wish some of that tasty fish -- we had pecan-crusted walleye and fried perch, respectively -- made its way onto the permanent menu."}
{"text":"Went last Sunday evening for dinner. It was like a completely different restaurant from the first time. Waiter seemed overwhelmed and forgot our appetizer ; food was \"blah\". Very disappointing. Must have had the \"B\" team in the kitchen. Can not recommend."}
{"text":"Happily out of place for the neighborhood! Unique and fun ambience, with live music. Sat at the bar both times, and enjoyed yummy featured specials like seared ahi tuna and pancetta stuffed chicken breast. The bruschetta was great, and my neighbors seafood pasta combo looked amazing. Female bartender was smiling and efficient both times, as well."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  The decor is too die for!  So fun to sit at the bar too. My favorite thing is Tommy!  He is always a treat. The food is yummy!!!  I highly suggest you go and try this place. It's wonderful!"}
{"text":"Had been here once before right after they opened. At that time it seemed like they were still figuring things out. After eating there again last night, it seems they have. 
Waiter was prompt and courteous. They had a nice but not overwhelming drink menu. The limoncello Collins was very good.
They had a number of specials available but in the end we chose an antipasto salad and seafood pasta to split. Both of them were really good. We even had a canolli for dessert.
The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the tables were a little close together. It was kinda hard to have a conversation without your neighbor without being overheard."}
{"text":"Our experience started from the second we reached the door. The owner made us feel at home and took the time to ensure every detail was perfect. It's not often that one comes across great people, excellent service and delicious home style food. All around an excellent dining experience and for sure many trips to come. Thank you Tommy for your kind words and welcoming gesture!!... P.S the cannoli is by far the best is town ! Don't leave without one"}
{"text":"WOW.... this place is so much different on the inside than you would guess from the outside and its surroundings.  VERY nicely decorated,... food was outstanding and the bartender and owner were extremely accommodating.  This is going to be one of my new dining staples.  There were like 10 things on the menu I wanted to try.  Awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a classic hole in the wall place that would be easily missed. Well do not let it happen to you. Seriously, check this place out. Personal favorites are the meatballs (not easy to get right) and the white linguini and clams."}
{"text":"Stopped here after the dinner rush, about 8:30. Got sat immediately by a host you'd expect in a New York style restaurant. The decor here is really nice. It's absolutely beautiful inside. The picture of Marilyn Monroe in the bathroom is one of the best things I've seen hanging in a restaurant. Service was good and attentive, as most of the tables were finishing. Ordered a few apps just to try this place out. Calamari came out nice and crisp, but not over cooked. Their tomato sauce was tasty too. Bruscetta was a little unconventional, coming with melted cheese. No biggie, next time I'll ask for it without. But both the calamari and Bruscetta were good but both needed to be seasoned more. The wings though, spot on. I couldn't tell if they brine them or just season them when preparing them, but they come out tasting fantastic, without dripping in sauce (which I do like, just not in a nice dining room like here) and BIG. Very meaty, very yummy wings. They had three ball games on too, without sound as not to ruin the ambience. So I was able to enjoy a meal with my family and keep up with the MLB. Definitely will be back for the full dinner experience. The dinner menu looks like good tradition east coast Italian."}
{"text":"Oh man, you guys. Come prepared with an empty stomach and wearing fat-pants. But first, you should probably make a reservation. We came here early (like, 5:40) on a Friday and I think we snagged the very last non-reservation table. I had read the reviews so we knew we had to haul it down here quickly after getting home from work. This place has a serious following.

As other people have said, parking is kind of a nightmare. We parked in the strip mall to the west (in front of Dose Moving), after we circled the block, but I'm not sure this is allowed during business hours. Just a pro-tip! If Uber is convenient, I'd say go that route.

The inside decor is not at all what you'd expect from looking at the austere outside. There's an upstairs loft area of tables, a gigantic and decorated bar, and lots of mod tchotchkes and pictures. I loved it. The dining room tables are kind of crammed together, but the food more than made up for it. Our server was attentive and she went over the night's specials in detail.

I had a $5 happy hour glass of pinot noir (a plus for arriving so early), and we started with the fried zucchini. They were perfect little deep-fried strips served with marinara. For my entree I continued the carb load and went with the manicotti, while my husband opted for the penne bolognese. Both were outstanding. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the manicotti filling had a delightful hint of nutmeg that really amped it up.

I wanted to end this review by saying Tommy's Place is a total hidden gem, but if the place is packed with what seemed like 95% regulars, is it really hidden? I'm glad we're now in on the secret!"}
{"text":"We went here with high hopes. It is in a weird area of town. The tables are so close together you can't move and servers seem inexperienced and not to upbeat. 
We had caeser salad, fried calamari, chicken parmesan, fettucini alfredo and a bottle of wine. For the price and atmosphere, we were not impressed. It was like Olive Garden, which we don't like. 
This place is trying to be upscale and it's not. Too many other places to dine in the valley. 
We tried to like it."}
{"text":"What a true gem!!!! Totally in love with this place. The food was fabulous and the live music on Saturday night was a great touch. It wasn't too loud and allowed easy conversation opportunity. Service was top notch. Can't say enough good things about this place. Definitely going to put Tommy's place in my rotation. 

There is parking in the back to the side of the building."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go! My mom and grandma are definitely regulars but they aren't the only ones. The bar is always packed with locals where everyone knows everyone. It is such a neighborhood atmosphere that makes you just comfortable and easy to enjoy your meal. 

They have live music on the weekends and sometimes during the week. They have a large porch in the back yard with a huge tree growing through it which makes it feel like you are in the south. It is on a street full of restaurants but this is the key. It is a casual diner that feels like family.

The food is delicious and comforting. Tommy's always has a great selection of specials but you can't go wrong with any of their burgers. I highly recommend this little slice of heaven located on a side street in the great city of Rocky River."}
{"text":"Tommy stole the show tonight. This is a true local gem! Trust that the food is authentic and made with lots of love."}
{"text":"Would not have guessed that this place would be so unique.  It's very cool inside with wait staff that treats you in a classy way.  Food was delicious.  Been there twice already and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Dinner, salad and wine for 2 under $60, GREAT italian food, nice decor, good service...not far from home?  For those times you don't want to go to all the trouble and expense of all the places NoSco seems to be filled with.  FINALLY!

Bonus - live music on weekends!

Tommy's place is pretty old school in a good way, yet has contemporary decor.  It is small, so reservations would be smart if you can plan ahead, but they've always been able to squeeze us in so far."}
{"text":"Great place... food and staff! Had a blast here on a first date. We enjoyed wine and amazing pasta dishes while chatting it up w the friendliest waitress, Amy. So much to look at here as well. Can't wait to go back and check out ladies night on a Wednesday! Hidden gem"}
{"text":"BEST RESTAURANT IN PHOENIX. Hands down the greatest meal I've had locally in a long time. The service was great, everyone had such a soulful vibe that gave you that \"small town\" feeling. Go for what ever the special is on the front chalk board and ask for the recommended glass to pair it with. Overall, the restaurant was beautifully lit, awesome live jazz music, and the owners are super sweet. 10/10 great experience!"}
{"text":"Nice place! Old school Italian owners with a great sense of humor. Great food. The live jazz was and unexpected added bonus. Nice tvs if you want to sit at the bar and watch a game. Peroni on tap. 

I've seen this locale change through numerous owners over the years. This ones a keeper. Nice job Tommy."}
{"text":"Found this place about a month ago. I don't usually consistently go to a restaurant but I have been going every Friday since. fun atmosphere and great Italian food. I've had several different dishes, all have been very good. When you first walk into the restaurant you immediately get a big warm greeting from the host. Great live entertainment on Friday and Saturdays. Staff is really friendly and fun. I'm really excited to bring my relatives from Chicago to Tommy's place this summer.  Overall impressed!"}
{"text":"We went to New York's Best Italian Bistro and it was surprisingly went down fast. Food wasn't that good and service was lacking cause John wasn't there anyone greeting. I was looking on Yelp and found a picture of John at Tommy's Place. Bookmarked cause I knew John was going to a new place with his cousin Tommy. 

Anyways, we decided to try Tommy tonight. Very very interesting. A couple of parking spaces in the front with more parking in the back but very limited. Very tight parking. 

We walked in and it's very interesting. Huge bar area on your left with dinning on your right. Not a lot of tables but nice. They do have seating upstairs too. They have four TVs for the bar area and it's decorated pretty cool. Big old bicycle hanging from the ceiling. At night just before we were leaving a live band was playing which is pretty cool too. Very open and fun type of place. 

We started off with the appetizer special which was flat bread with prosciutto and goat cheese. It was really good and came with three pieces which was perfect for us. We also got an antipasto salad. This was so good with light Italian dressing with grilled peppers, Pepperoni, salami, jalapeño and ice berg lettuce. Really good. Really fresh. 

I ordered the entree special which was rigatoni in a parmesan cheese bowl. I heard that John made the bowls so I knew this had to be good. Rigatoni was outstanding. The cheese bowl was a little to salty for my taste and the garlic bread was outstanding. Very good meal. Right portion. Not to much and not to little. 

My wife got the spaghetti Bolognese sauce. This was her go to dish at New York Best Bistro. She really did like it. Loved the garlic bread but she really missed the potato bread that New York Bistro served. Oh well. It was good and she enjoyed it. 

My son got his regular at New York Bistro too. Linguini with clams with added chicken for protein. Fresh clams. He didn't complain about this. Really good. He enjoyed it. 

The place is pretty fun. Lively. We were talking to the couple at a table next to us and they were regulars at New York Bistro too. The service was great. We had Ro and she was so friendly. Making sure everything was okay. Filling our water cups and clearing our dishes. We know another server there too Juan who used to work at New York Bistro. Plus John was there who brought his recipes form New York Bistro. So service was great. 

So overall it was a great meal. Good food. Good service. Great ambiance. Only downside is the parking. Can be difficult to get in and out but it's worth it. We will be coming back again and probably be regulars. Enjoy"}
{"text":"We found this place through Yelp looking for a place to eat after golf!  All I can say is WOW. The food was amazing! The service was awesome!  The decor is cool and hip!  We are already planning on returning!  The pizza is TRUE NY pizza!  The antipasta salad was really, really good, but the best thing we ate was the Bruschetta!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and outstanding service. A party of 16 of us went to Tommy's to celebrate my husbands 30th birthday. We were greeted by the owner, Tommy and his staff so warmly as soon as we arrived. Our servers were without a doubt on top of their game with accommodating such a big group. No one complained not once. Now as for the food.. DELICIOUS! Everyone loved their plate and couldn't stop talking about it the entire weekend. The ambiance was perfect and they even had live music who did a shout out to my husband. Thank you so much Tommy for making our night. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Customer service A++ . The food was so good! Place has dim lighting and small but cozy. I enjoyed my experience here and I will be back. The prices are fare for the amount of food served. I'm happy with my first experience here. They made my Tuesday evening better just by the great service."}
{"text":"Been driving past for a few weeks now and finally stopped for dinner.  Incredible food, great service and wonderful people. Anthony was great behind the bar, Tommy & the rest of the staff are very attentive and friendly. Outstanding Bruschetta appetizer and one of the best Chicken Piccata I've ever had. Spaghetti and meatballs was fabulous as well. We can't wait to return and try everything else on the menu. 
Check it out, your only regret will be you didn't come here sooner."}
{"text":"Amazing New York style Italian food.  
The Chicken Piccata was perfect.  The wine sauce with capers was just right. 

I had spaghetti with meatballs the second time I went there.  The meatballs were moist. The sauce was delicious.  

I'll certainly be making this my first Italian food choice in the future!"}
{"text":"Im visitimg from out of town and found this place on yelp so i fiugured why not.
Parking: sufficient they have two lots next to eachother.
Atmosphere: walked in to a friendly host that ended up being thr mgr. And the accomidated my family of four even though i had no reservation and found us a spot, met the singer right away and he was great, even for a Giants fan.
Service: due to a glitch in communication we sat for about 20 min with no attention until my wife went looking for someone. But the waiter promptly came afterwards apologized and tbe mgr also came and pardoned the situation and compd our appetizer, more than made up for it.
Food: Wow! We had the caeser salad which was great, tbe calamari was cooked to perfection as a result my 4 yr old loves it now, garlic bread was yum, the kids had spaghetti and meatballs and the tore into it even my 3 yr old who never wants to eat demolished her plate, and finally the lazagna..freaking amazing. 
If i even come back to Phoenix this is where you will find me!"}
{"text":"I went here with my mom for lunch. Incredible food,great service, and love the atmosphere. I will be back here for sure! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place and, holy smokes, the food and service was amazing! Some of the best chicken piccata I've had in years. There was a slight mixup when it came to the type of side pasta we ordered (not really a big deal to us) and they were so apologetic, they took our dessert off the bill. Wasn't necessary, but we really appreciated it. Will differently recommend this place to others and I'll be back to check out the live music and dinner scene."}
{"text":"Best  authentic Italian Food and ambiance you will find in Phoenix. You won't be disappointed. Tommy, the owner, his family and staff are extraordinary."}
{"text":"I experienced Tommy's on a fluke. Was supposed to meet at the Rocky River Wine Bar for book club but with the heavy storms - Wine Bar flooded and wasn't serving. We went right next door to Tommy's.

Tommy's has a huge patio but we obviously chose to stay inside from the storm. The inside is small and quaint. The bar is a gorgeous wooden bar with intricate detail allowing maybe 20 patrons to sit. There were a few tables along the wall with 2 rounds for bigger parties. My party at I sat at one of the rounds and the bartender set us up with menus and everything.

The menu was just typical bar food and on the smaller side, nothing special but we were there to talk about the book more than the food.They also had a drink menu which was nice. $6 for a glass of wine is A-OK in my book especially when Wine Bar prob would of been $10. I ordered the house Cab which was Canyon Road and it was great for conversation and my meal. We ordered nachos to start and they came out in a quick manner and were actually delicious. Tortilla chips weren't sogged. There was enough beef, cheese, tomatoes and everything. For entrees we all got some sort of sandwich. I built my own burger and subbed sweet potato fries for $1. The burger was cooked perfectly (medium) and was thick and juicy. My sweet potatoes fries were seasoned perfectly and had such good flavor. Other ladies at the table got pulled pork, chicken sandwich, black & blue burger. Everyone was saying their food was great. We all tried some of the pulled pork and it was amazing.

The service was great. The bartender was also our server and always made sure we had refills on our waters or drinks and they were never empty. She promptly brought out small plates and napkins for our appetizer as well. None of us had to ask for anything as she was always on top of it. 

Will definitely be back here again for drinks and to sit on the patio, or when i'm feeling a burger or bar food."}
{"text":"It's hard to get a reservation, but the food is delicious . I tried on a Mon. To get a reservation for 6 on a Fri. They were completely booked"}
{"text":"Meh!

This is an over-rated restaurant folks. Let's be clear that this is NOT a gem of a YELP \"foodie\" discovery. Nope.

This is sadly yet *another* one of the many Phoenix overpriced, overrated, uninspired comfort food operations catering to a (mostly) wealthy geriatric and pseudo biker crowd that thinks \"Chicken Parm\" and \"Penne ala Vodka\" are gourmet treats. What a joke. 

Went here last night for the first time after reading all the YELP rave reviews. It was my wife's birthday and we made 5pm reservations a week ago. I also let them know it was a special occasion. 

Upon arrival our family were seated upstairs, overlooking the bar. Yes the place is decorated very cutely - kind of like the \"Rio hotel casino\" in Vegas meets \"Goodfellas.\" The location I think is what is what is helping boost the reviews here - it's an odd duck location next to the bowling alley and across from old standby Red Devil across the street. I'm sure people have been hankering for a new Italian joint around this slightly seedy area. We had big hopes too after reading the YELP reviews! 

As soon as we were seated (I mean instantly) things got off to a bad start. Our waitress approached the table. \"Hello and welcome! Would you care for any drinks besides water? Oh, by the way - we will need you to all be DONE with your dinner by 7pm firm as we have this table reserved for others! No problem. Just make sure you are finished by 7 OK?\"

Wow. We all just looked at each other, puzzled. We were not a walk-in. We arrived on time. We had a reservation. It was my wife's birthday (which we told in advance). Yet the #1 thing we are told at 5pm on a Saturday night with a reservation ... is we need to hurry up and eat. Wow. Weird. 

So like I said the menu is pretty much the same Italian/American comfort style favorites that you will easily find at about 100 other Italian joints in Phoenix. Places like Ristorante Giuseppe in Scottsdale (or Red Devil across the street). Prices here at Tommy are however all the the medium high side, averaging $16-27 for the chicken parm or veal (Picatta, Parm, Marsala, etc). 

Let me cut to the chase: The food was good but certainly not stellar by a long shot. The sauces were competent. I make better Marsala at home. The pastas tasted ordinary and were not cooked al dente. 

What we have here with Tommy's place my friends is a cute establishment in an area desperately needing more good food options. This place caters to the east coast crowd with a few bucks after retirement, seeking comfort classics in a nice clean little place. 

I won't be back most likely because for the average $30 spent per person, this was not great food nor was it a value for my money. The weird rush to be out by 7 started things off oddly, but if the food would have been amazing we would have promptly forgotten that. 

The food was not bad, but it was very ordinary Italian comfort food that was not remotely  deserving of a 5 Star YELP rating. No way.
***Update: Just to be clear, this is a genuine review based on our dinner on March 3rd, we had never been here before, we do not know any of the owners or employees. We had very high hopes for this place. It was my wife's birthday and we had our two daughters with us. I'm a longtime YELPER for nearly a decade, with more than 80 posted reviews. under my belt. We sincerely wanted a great experience but we were disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice place. It's an Oasis for the area. Had the wings and they were excellent. This place has only been open a week and the menu looks top notch. I do recommend trying it. The main menu is Italian and is legit. I will be back to eat like a human once my diet is over."}
{"text":"Where I came from \"back east\" sub sandwiches weren't fancy and most places only made them a couple of different ways. If a guy tried to skimp or not use real deli meats he would be out of business in no time.  So having lived in Phoenix for so long what took me so long to find Tommy's Place?

I live so close to this bar/restaurant that I could almost walk but somehow never saw it and certainly never would have expected it to be what it turned out to be. Thank you Yelp for helping me discover it and bookmark it.

Tonight was the night I had a craving for a good Italian sub and remembered seeing it listed on the menu at Tommy's Place. They actually only have four varieties of cold subs and the TNT is their \"authentic\" Italian one. We drove over and were greeted at the door by Tommy himself, who we discovered is a totally hands-on restaurateur. He welcomed us warmly and a waiter immediately greeted us and took our to-go order. One a Monday night the place was mostly full, a good sign. The décor is friendly, eclectic and reminded me of a Cheers atmosphere.  Zero pretensions or attitude. Pretty much every server took time to say hi even though we weren't dining in. Tommy chatted with us while we were waiting while keeping a watchful eye to make sure every customer was being well taken care of.

Our sandwiches proved why none, and I mean none, of the big national chains can or will ever be able to make a real east coast sub sandwich. The bread was fresh, there was just the right amount of deli meats that actually tasted different from each other and an adequate amount of veggies but not so much as to overpower that this is a meat-based sandwich. Being a self-proclaimed sub sandwich connoisseur I rank Tommy's version up there among some of the best. And as huge as it is its only $8.95. I mean what is it with some of the chain places charges near twenty bucks for a sub sandwich these days? And Tommy's loads the plate with a generous amount of French Fries as well. The fries were just okay, probably frozen, but I can't say they were bad either.  I doused them with some malt vinegar and they were fine.

This place has an extensive Italian menu which over time I'm sure I'll work my way through and I'll tag on to this review if anything sticks out as extra special.

I understand Tommy has a reputation for knowing good food and how to serve it, and it shows. The formula isn't rocket science ... stick to basics of good food, good service, good prices and treat people right."}
{"text":"Just had Lunch here.....This place is Amazing...The Food is Outstanding..Consistency is the key and this place has that.....Tanya was Great...She is always Attentive  ..Keep up the Great Work.....Thanks Michael"}
{"text":"Great, great place- food, atmosphere, staff and service= Great. Wine list is a + too, nice Pinot Noir"}
{"text":"The food was great. The people were super. We'll definitely be coming back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"This place definitely did not disappoint. The interior is not what you'd expect when driving up to it. It was very busy since it was Sunday but the staff was extremely nice and knowledgeable. We had calamari to start off as an appetizer. The serving was generous and great

For my plate had the Manacotti and it was delicious. Our server was on point, too. I never had to ask for anything and if I did have a question it was answered. 

Don't judge a book by it's cover, guys. Definitely want to come back on Friday or Saturday when they have live music."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. Conner was bartending, he was hilarious and made some great drinks. Music was wonderful, food was incredible and Tommy is a great host. He even order a antipasto for my friend whose birthday it was on the house! I have to say the previous restaurants here were not that great but this is really worth the money.  I had the lasagne. It was fully of flavor and steaming hot. I really have nothing but good things to say about this place highly recommend checking it out on a Friday or Saturday or even during the week just for the food. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went back for happy hour Friday night to give this place one more chance. Bar dead. No one there. No flavored martinis, as we were rudely told, and they did NOT give us any appetizer deals. Even though our waiter from previous weekend told us there was \"half off appetizers\" during happy hour. The two cranky bartenders told my friend and I \"we're starting happy hour Monday.\" My gosh! They couldn't even honor what we were told before and try to keep us as customers! Mark my words, this place will not make it. They're way overpriced for the neighborhood, they are rude and cranky, and they offer nothing in the way of a fun happy hour. This area needs a fun happy hour place that has a great atmosphere and really friendly staff. It is sorely lacking in that department. And I gave this place two separate opportunities to keep me as a customer and they failed miserably both times. One star is too many for this location. Don't bother."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious!!! Fabulous atmosphere and incredible dishes! We had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and the penne a la vodka. Yummmmmmmmy! Jason was our server; he was very knowledgeable and had great recommendations. If you haven't tried this place yet, definitely come on in! It's the perfect place for date night!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem...devouring...FOOD...place..cozy...romantic...music...service! WOW!! I will definitely  be coming back to try other dishes. We had the sea food combo...shrimp scampi...lasagna...pizza...spicy red pasta..tiramisu...."}
{"text":"Okay, best first, Stromboli, meatballs, calzone, the sauce... dayum! The calzone with fresh ricotta and mozzarella with my request of spinach and mushrooms, it was so totally heaven. The Stromboli was inhaled by my son. Soft and flavorful meatballs and a tomato sauce that is so perfect. 
The not perfect: the alfredo sauce broke, flavor was great, but"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've seen this place a million times driving down Bell rd. This place is a hidden gem! The atmosphere is vibrant and has plenty of eclectic treasures to keep your eyes busy before your food comes out. Okay let's get to the best part, the food. Wow I wish I could've taken a picture for you guys but we ate it so fast! The chicken Alfredo, Lasagna and the Manicotti were sooooooooo good!  No more going to Olive Garden! This place is where you will get some of the best Italian entrees"}
{"text":"Love the location- inside is cozy and cute for a cold night.  And they have the best deck with trees around it and still an outdoor TV.  Great place to just have a beer and a sandwich.  Food is nothing spectacular but still a place we like to go for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and great!!!!!  Live music on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday   Didn't think it would be such a great place   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Simply put - what a great addition to the North East Phoenix restaurant scene.  Let's get this out of the way first - the quality of the food makes this restaurant worthy of a five star rating.  Lapses in service, and cleanliness, cost it a star in this rating.  I look forward to giving Tommy's the additional fifth star in the future. There are no bargains here; this is not a budget \"all your want pasta, salad, and bread sticks\" joint.  Tommy's is a superb Italian restaurant with food that is well-prepared and fairly priced in an intimate setting perfect for date night, family dinners, or just a lunch or pasta dinner with a glass of wine. The wine list is small, but offers an appropriate selection that can be paired with the food.  (Mama Mia red blend is a great bottle of wine ($38 - or $10 per glass). There is an excellent trumpet player on the week-ends.

Physically, the outside is deceiving and has the look of a dive bar sandwiched between some suspect retail operations.  Inside, the restaurant is an intimate mix of a long bar and booths and tables.  Entering and exiting the parking in the back can be problematic, but the dining experience makes it all worthwhile.  

A few menu recommendations: Penne alla Vodka with chicken ($16); Spaghetti Carbonara ($15); Sausage and Peppers with any pasta ($16), and any pizza. There is a \"Specials\" board on the wall; recently I had bacon-wrapped cream cheese filled dates on one occasion; and on another, the Caprese - breaded and fried -  and served in a marinara sauce; both fantastic.  A note about the Entrees - although the menu states most of these items are offered with \"a side of pasta\" specify if you want your pasta on the side, or mixed with the entree itself.  In my personal experience, the kitchen has a tendency to put it all together unless your are clear that you want a \"side of pasta\".

The staff is cordial and seem to know every customer, and will know you on your second visit.  Service seems spotty and I have had to ask for a fork or a knife or a napkin, or a wine glass sans lipstick [I prefer direct lip to lip application :)] on seemingly every visit. On a recent visit, the diner next to me used his napkin and laid the silverware that was inside the napkin on his place mat, using the salad fork that came with his Cesar. When he was finished, the server took the dirty dish and salad fork, simply straightened the remaining  silverware, and didn't wipe down the place mat, nor even replace the napkin. The food is good enough to overcome these lapses........but professional reviewers, of which I definitely am not one - and some diners, will be put off by these issues.

I will continue to dine here.  It is far better than any of the other \"Italian\" restaurants in the area.

See you there."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Great ambience, friendly service, and Italian food that will blow your mind. 

If you're a calamari person, the spicy calamari appetizer is a must have. I love the chicken piccata and the carbonara is also spot on. 

Prices are good for the quality, and drink prices are fabulous! Not a huge wine selection, but what they do have is good quality and affordable. 

Live music on the weekends, and the owner is usually there making sure everything is running smoothly, which is a really nice touch. We will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"Second time here, and it was incredible. Everything hand made in house. Cesar dressing was too die for. Husband had fettuccine Alfredo. Handmade sauce and noodles. Yes Tommy, and John, we will return"}
{"text":"A real gem! Everything from the antipasto salad to the prosciutto di Parma appetizer to the clams with white sauce to the (best!) cannoli I've had this side of the Atlantic...Tommy's Place is legit!! And Tommy is an amazing host, the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. We came on the recommendation of my wife's boss and we plan to become regulars! Thanks Tommy and Jason for a memorable evening!"}
{"text":"I had the manicotti tonight and it was so so good! The atmosphere was really fun,  the tables were a little close together but the food was delicious.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food great service, we had the Anti Pasta, Moms gravy, eggplant and chicken Picata. It was absolutely delicious and reasonable. The place was very nicely done. And we will be back soon"}
{"text":"This was such an amazing restaurant. Service was great. The ambiance was great. Most of all, the food was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. My wife and I live nearby and happened to stumble into Tommy's Place, a few weeks ago. We've been back once each week since...don't judge; it's addictive. Sonny, the humble chef, and his gifted team have found a way to perfectly convey their passion for food in everything that I've seen them prepare. The food is so good that when I eat here, I feel loved. Aside from having the best food in Phoenix, the service is phenomenal. We've dined in twice and called in take out once. Our server was Matthew for both dine in visits and he was top notch! Our food was just as beautifully delicious on our take out visit, as well. Lots of places fail at take out and the integrity of their dishes are compromised but, not here. To add to everything, this place has even more with its eclectic decor and personable owner putting it well over the top. I wish I could give them 10 stars."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, allowed us to sit down an hour before closing and treated us amazingly. The atmosphere is fantastic and welcoming. The owner was super friendly when we apologized for coming in so late and he made us feel very comfortable."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly great place! Tommy is a consummate host. Nice, open, airy dining area. Really on-point Italian food. Some of the best cannoli I've had anywhere, and I'm very particular. Plus a smooth little shot of espresso and a sip of port to cap off the meal. How civilized!"}
{"text":"Stubbled on this place.  Really good pasta, service and atmosphere at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The best way to describe Tommy's is the only consistent part is it's always inconsistent. The food on one night can be fabulous. The food on the next night can be horrible. The taste, portion and quality will literally change by the night. Even the same night, two people at the same table can order the same meal and they're different! There is absolutely no consistency. I've grown tired of coming here and leaving disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my hubby's choice for his birthday and I'm glad he chose here because their pastas were spot on. 
They had live music which added a nice touch. They were packed on a Saturday night around 7 but managed to get a table on the second floor right away.
The waitress was friendly and took good care of us. My hubby had combo seafood on a bed of linguine. He loved the flavor and said the flavor reminded him of linguine with clam sauce. I had the spicy penne alla arrabbiata with sausage. If you like spicy food like me, then this is it! The dish came out piping hot and was very satisfying. The portions were huge enough to have leftovers.
The only thing I didn't like was the calamari. The calamari were on the small side and once fried it was really dry and didn't have much bite to it. Everything else was perfect."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  Had a great meal there with my husband last Sat.  So, you are probably wondering why only 2 stars?  Esp w the nice deck they have and the very pleasant blonde waitress?  Well, she was a THIEF!  She changed the tip on our bill from approximately $10 to $30.  It was caught by our credit card company.  They sent my husband an e-mail that that was a really big tip for an inexpensive meal.  Thank heavens they caught it."}
{"text":"I love this place and the food. Usually our go tospot for good (great food) and usually good conversation with the bartender.  Not tonight.  Conner was a nice guy but could he could asked about the food? \"How'a the food folks?\"   This wonderful spot usually has an old school, mid-town New York feel.  Not tonight. Conner was nice but spent all his time talking to a gentleman at the end of the bar about his divorce, custody battle and other details I wouldn't repeat here but we all heard at the bar.  The professionalism is always on display and we're sadden it's changed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian place in Phoenix! It really brings life to the surrounding area. The food is absolutely amazing and the specials are to die for.

My recommendation for an entree is to get the chicken parmesan with vodka sauce. You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"I love this place and the atmosphere here.  I came here for my birthday last month with about 7 friends.  I had booked ahead and they were welcome to my group.  We were treated sooo well and the service was amazing.  The food was wonderful as well, everyone loved their dishes.  My boyfriend and I came back last night to have dinner and had just as wonderful as an experience.  I had the baked ziti with meat sauce.  OMG, they mix ricotta cheese in before baking it, the best baked ziti I have ever had.  I wish I could say I will be back.  I am moving to Atlanta next week and won't get the chance which makes me sad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and delicious food. The Shrimp Parm was so delicious, my toddler was trying to eat my entire meal. We came here on a Monday and it was pretty quite (even background music was quite low making us a little nervous that if my toddler made a peep, it would interfere with others dinners) but I bet this place is awesome on a Friday/Saturday when they have live music.

Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Everything about Tommy's Place is great ! The food , drinks , live music and most of all, the atmosphere is so welcoming ! Even the decor is great ! Definitely will be coming back! We definitely enjoyed our time there and we loved the fact the owner was constantly around to make sure everything was great!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and have been super excited to try out this new restaurant. It did not disappoint. From the decor, atmosphere, food and people, it was really something special. Tommy himself made an appearance and you could tell he genuinely cared about our dining experience. Such a nice guy. Actually everyone was so nice. A \"Cheers\" like vibe. It was really refreshing. Oh yeah, and the food was great! Tommy gave us his own recommendations and he was right, the meatballs were out of this world. We are already planning our next visit!"}
{"text":"A frustrated New Yorkers dream place. It is outstanding. The decor is fun too! I loved the Broadway signs on the bathroom doors. ha! The servers were amazing and the food is great! They even have music on Friday and Saturday nights. I felt like I was a little girl again eating at my sicilian's best friend's house.  I had pizza, meatballs, garlic bread and Tiramisu. It was all excellent."}
{"text":"Finally great Italian food in Phoenix! Move over Olive Garden, there is a new kid in town! Yes, I did go there in High School... Anyway, my husband happened along Tommy's and wouldn't stop raving about it so I decided to give it a try. They have a motorcycle floating from the ceiling and beautiful glass pieces and chandeliers. Super quirky and colorful. This place is so wonderful! An ambiance unlike most restaurants, there is so much to look at and the food was delicious! 
We started with the meatball appetizer and split a caesar salad. The caesar dressing was homemade and one of the best I've had in a long time. The meatballs were so moist and flavorful also. For my dinner I had a white wine pasta dish with potatoes, artichokes and chicken in it. I describe this in detail as I can't pronounce or remember the name! I will level with you- I can't stop thinking about this pasta. So authentic and it is officially on my illustrious \"Meals I Remember\" list. Any food lover has one even if you call it something different! My picky 4 year old loved her fettuccini alfredo with chicken and broccoli. She thought Tommy's was cool and so did I! We will be back, maybe tomorrow."}
