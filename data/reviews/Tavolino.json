{"text":"Picked up a Chicken sandwich from here today. $10...   THE CHICKEN WASN'T UNDERCOOKED, IT WAS RAW.  Like bleeding raw. My coworker picked up a veal sandwich that was VERY overcooked.  You like consistency? Don't eat here. You like overpriced, under/overcooked meats on a mountain of bread? You'll love this joint.  Pics up there ^^ take a look."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of enjoying a Tavolino sandwich last week.   I work in the area, and our office is always looking for new lunch options. We all decided to order something and give the new place a try. I got the chicken sandwich - the others chose the porchetta and the calabrese.  The chicken sandwich was pretty tasty. It looked and tasted fresh (and homemade)! The lemon aioli was a little tangy for my liking, but I thought it went nicely with the chicken & pea shoots. I would have liked the flavour to be a bit more balanced - next time I would probably order the porchetta or rib-eye.   It may be pricier, but most places in the area are comparable. I'd like to try some of the non-sandwich menu items... I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious - DELICIOUS - home-made pasta & bred basket. Fresh ingredients, super authentic flavours, nice atmosphere, and family-run vibe. The owner literally cam out to the streets to invite us to dine in (throw-back to Italy!) and recommended the chef's (his brother's!) selections for the day. The food was exceptionally tasty. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent. I had the veal Marsala and it was exactly what I wanted it to be. The service was great and the atmosphere is quiet and warm, and kind of takes you back to an older time.   The flourless chocolate cake was excellent. More of a dense mousse but truly excellent."}
{"text":"Another great dinner at Tavolino tonight! Such a friendly atmosphere. Unpretentious and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service great. The mussels and the crab tagliatelle were particularly good."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Tavolino to open for what seems like a year now. Every day I pass by and kept wondering what was hiding behind the brown papered window. On the few days I could sneak a peek in there was nothing but bare brick so I was pleasantly surprised when I finally found it open two nights ago.  Tavolino is on the small side but all the shops along this strip are. I saw table seating for about 24 people which should be plenty since it seems like a lunch time grab and go kind of place. Their menu isn't very large which I like because that means they can pay more attention to making things well instead of trying to appeal to everyone and being sloppy. I had the po'boy, greens and diced tomato with mayo and popcorn shrimp, which was surprisingly light and didn't make me feel like I needed a nap afterward. My friend had the ribeye and was not only really happy with the size of the sandwich (he's a big guy with a big appetite) but said it tasted great. I've heard their lamb is fantastic as well but I'll have to find out for myself later this week.  There is a small selection of drinks available near the counter. I'm sure they will probably add to selection but for now you're looking at water, Brio, Coke, limonata and one other drink that I've never heard of but is probably really tasty.  I'm going to suggest that we start calling this strip of King street \"sandwich alley\" because that seems to be the only thing opening in that block of stores. Big smoke, Reggie's and The one that got away (yes they do sandwiches too) have all been doing well and Tavolino will make a fine addition to the group. Their prices are on par with the other shops and the ingredients are fresh and flavourful keeping with the theme of good somewhat fast food. I'd like to see them add a few more drink options and I'll be interested to see if there are any more additions to the menu in the coming weeks."}
{"text":"We were walking down Mount Pleasant one day and saw that this restaurant opened up. We've tried all the other Italian restaurants around Yonge/Mount Pleasant & Eglinton so we wanted to try this one as well. Just the other day we remembered it and went for dinner. It was an excellent meal! We started with the Calamari/Shrimp/Fried  Artichoke and it was very delicious. In particular, the shrimp was wonderfully seasoned and lightly breaded and fried to perfection. I only wish there was more of it. I had the Penne Con Vodka for dinner and it was also very delicious. I love cream tomato sauce and this sauce surpassed my expectations. For dessert we had the home-made donuts which were decadent and delightful. There were three donuts: one filled with lemon sauce, one with berry sauce and one with chocolate. Overall an excellent meal!  The atmosphere and service were also lovely and the owner came by to make sure we were having a good time. A great little restaurant! My only criticism was that they played the same classical song on repeat the whole night. It took a while to notice but once we did we could only wonder why they only played one song... Regardless I would most definitely go back!"}
{"text":"As a resident of the neighbourhood, I am always excited when a new restaurant opens - although the competition is stiff on this stretch of Mount Pleasant, as there are several outstanding food options in the area.  With that in mind, Tavolino certainly lives up to its' neighbours. The food here is simply excellent. The owner, Vince, recommended the special 'Pork Cheek Caesar Salad' and allowed us to order it, even though it was part of a prix fixe menu that we did not partake in. The reco was spot on, as it was the best Caesar salad I have ever enjoyed.  Although the salad was a tough act to follow, the mains certainly held up. My wife and I enjoyed the gorgonzolla gnocchi and orecchiette bolognese. Both were outstanding. The flavours were brilliant and the sauces not too heavy. Perfectly balanced meals.  We took home a brunch menu, which also looks very intriguing. We will be sampling this at our first opportunity."}
{"text":"This restaurant had The Italian ambience of original Italy The tastiness of the food matches the best of Italian cooking and the service was most attentive and professional. We even enjoyed chatting with our host and the amiable chef Best of luck for the future"}
{"text":"The food and service were great.  Our waiter Andre' was a good waiter and the restaurant is a nice place, however; what's the deal with the owner ?? This old and crusty owner was on the staff so bad my wife wanted to leave and not finish her \"Spigola\" (which was superb). He was really abusing his staff and we could see that one of the Servers (who we were told was new) was visibly upset and we watched the owner chew him out behind the bar. Not sure if we can recommend this place based on that type of behavior.  Too Bad."}
{"text":"Great Food!! Everything I had was amazing. Plus the staff was super friendly and they really makes you feel comfortable. I highly recommend the mini donuts. Well worth the calories :-). I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great new addition to Toronto's dining scene. Simple menu, great food, excellent staff, cozy atmosphere. Highly recommend veal parm"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite restaurant in this area! Always a great experience and the food is great as well!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever enjoyed a meal so much but given a low rating. Tavolino is the perfect example of how a single element can ruin an otherwise wonderful meal. That element was a rude owner who visibly treated his staff with disrespect and micromanaged the whole evening in an uncomfortable way.  The servers were extremely capable and there appeared to be three of them for a busy 35 seat dining room. If you ask me, the server to customer ratio was perfect without this man looming over everyone in the dining room.  We arrived and were asked by the owner if we had reservation.We told him we did and He proceeded to walk off and top up the wine of another table while waving one of the servers (who was clearly in the middle of something) over to seat us. Not the most welcoming of gestures. We sat down at a nice cozy table and began to decide on wine and dinner choices.   Our servers were all very professional and extremely friendly. We ordered the grilled calamari, Eggplant Parmigiana, Gorgonzola Gnocchi, and the Osso Bucco as well as a bottle Ripasso that the server opened and decanted for us. He was nice enough to leave the bottle on the unoccupied table next to us, but mentioned that if a table came in, he would have to move it back. We appreciated his consideration, but shortly after we heard (and saw) the owner giving him shit for leaving the wine on a different table. There were many instances like this throughout the night.  They brought out some complimentary bruschetta that was nice while we sipped on our wine and the appetizers were both delicious. But I couldn't help but be irritated by this man who did nothing but point at his staff, treat them with disrespect and act like he was the most benevolent person to ever open a restaurant by lumbering around and trying to suck up to guests by performing useless tasks. Perhaps this sort of treatment and antiquated machismo is okay is rural Italy. If it is, I've never seen it, and certainly being a  business owner calls for better treatment and basic respect of the staff. Especially when the guests can plainly see all of this.  At one point, this owner came over and picked up our wine from the table beside us and plonked it carelessly on our table and wandered off, not topping up our wine or asking how anything was. It was really rude and I told our server so. The staff were excellent at managing our irritation and did everything they could to make sure that we enjoyed the food and had great service.  The Osso Bucco was good. I liked how it was served with gorgonzola polenta and rapini-- a little different than the typical risotto that normally accompanies Osso Bucco. Gnocchi was light and pillowy. Sauce could have used a little more salt, but I tend to like things salty. Overall, the food was really well done. Kudos to the chef. Apparently the 'owner' is his brother.   After our server had come to top up our glasses with wine, the owner came over and tried to re-do the same task. We asked him not to, because we had just been topped up and wanted to drink slowly. We thanked him for coming over. He grunted and lumbered off. Everything about him was creepy and rude.  Later, I saw him mutter something to our female server and slap her out of the way. She handled everything in stride, and even remarked how she liked him and that was just how he is, but I don't think there is room for this sort of treatment in any workplace. Especially not in such a small dining room where everything is quite obvious to the guests. Regardless, she was a true professional.  Dessert was excellent. The flourless chocolate cake was extraordinary.  Five stars to the wonderful servers who did everything they could to make us happy and were all complete professionals. The owner needs have more faith in their skills and leave them to do their jobs.  Five stars for the wonderful food. The chef knows his stuff and is doing great job. The menu is thoughtful and well executed.  I consider bad treatment of staff to be reason enough to never return to an establishment. Especially if I have to witness it with my own eyes. Please, Mr. Owner, leave service in the hands of the professionals you hired and treat them with respect. They work hard and do a great job. I don't want to come back to your restaurant and have to spend my night off feeling bad for everyone who works for you and be annoyed by the fact that you're in the way.  I sincerely hope that the servers are not required to turn in a portion of their tips to this man.  Would I recommend Tavolino? No. Spend your money at a place where you can be sure the staff are respected or, make sure you come in on a night when this owner is not working and tip the staff extra. They deserve it for putting up with this guy.  P.S. Some of the other five star reviews for this place seem pretty spammy, brief and are all written by people with under 6 reviews total. Could easily be fake profiles and reviewers."}
{"text":"Good Food, Good server (Neither excellent); but VERY RUDE Front of the house. He must be the son of the owner. Very rude, and made weird comments that really bummed us out. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. The staff were efficient and friendly. The service and food was phenomenal. For a treat out on the town it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The staff are extremely friendly, the food is delicious. Recommend the grilled calamari, bruchetta, and pizza bianca di prochuitto!"}
{"text":"obviously this place is brand new and not finished with the decore and all the little details, so no points deducted in that category  sandwiches were quite good, ordered porchetta ..the texture, flavor, size and of course the ratio of bun-meat- dressing..  no liquor license yet so no beer for me but def will check back again when i feel like yummy sandwiches"}
{"text":"I unfortunately have to disagree with my fellow yelpers on this place. I found their sandwiches extremely pricey for what you get. Yes, the bread is good and the ingredients fancy and fresh. But I was disappointed by the fact that the sandwich was all bread with a little sum of ingredients in the it and not a lot of flavour. I ordered the famous Po'Boy. The shrimp were quite good, but other than this, there was not much excitement to report on. Furthermore, I decided to add some nice Fleur-de-Lis Cheese to it before I ordered, then realizing that if I had not, the sandwich would have been even more plain than it was. So, in sum, for a breaded shrimp sandwich with sauce, tomato, spinach and shrimp for $13.50, I would much rather spend my lunch money on something else.  Viviana."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, but still fresh in my mind. This is one of those experiences that I have truly struggled with how exactly to capture in words.   I'll start by saying that I used a Travelzoo voucher with a work friend. We were both quite recent transplants to the city earlier this year and I was taking advantage of some online deals as a way to explore and save a few bucks.   I know these deals can be hit or miss, but I figure it's usually worth it. Usually. In this case, it was not worth the insignificant savings we received for this particular deal.   The whole meal started out on a bad note. I had forgotten my cell phone at home, which I needed in order to use the voucher. I had mentioned the voucher when I made the reservation and again mentioned it when we were seated. The server asked to see the voucher when we sat down, which of course I couldn't show due to not having my phone. My friend said that if we don't have the voucher, he would just pay regular price and we'd come back with the voucher another time. We asked to have a glass of wine to start, but the waiter REFUSED to serve us until we produced the voucher! Of course, this was the most ridiculous thing I'd ever heard, as we had just said we'd pay regular price if we couldn't get it. But no, he said he wouldn't serve us until we could show it. I borrowed my friend's phone and managed to access my voucher online to present to the server. He finally conceded to bring our wine. This was the only time I'd ever been asked to show a voucher before ordering. Usually it's given at the end of the meal, so this was very strange.   I had actually looked at the menu online so that I could decide ahead of time what to order. The terms of the deal stated that entrées had to be $24 or less, which did not leave many choices. I was dismayed to find that the restaurant menu (vs online menu) had increased the price of several entrées so they would no longer be eligible for the deal - including the one I had chosen. I asked if I could pay the difference (it was $2) but was refused. I ended up choosing a salmon entrée, which was really good. In fact, all of the food was quite good, most notably the tiramisu, which was made in house that day.   I just can't get over how poorly we were treated by the server. I don't know if he was the manager or not, but his attitude towards us was horrible. When we asked for more wine, we were told 'no'. WTH?? No?!? He then said, \"You only get one glass of wine with the voucher.\" We had to explain that yes, we understand what's included - we'll pay for the wine on top of the voucher price.   The straw that broke the camel's back for me, was when the bill came. He had added the tax on the regular price of the food and drinks instead of on the voucher price. When I mentioned his mistake, he literally argued with me and was extremely rude and condescending towards me. I happen to know how these deals work when it comes to tax rules and when I attempted to explain to him, he just kept talking over me, very loudly, telling me I was wrong. Sorry, buddy, you can raise your voice as loud as you want, it doesn't make you right. It's a good thing for him that my friend paid the bill because at that point I would've given him a zero tip for the way he spoke to me.   The food here was really very good, hence the two stars. But because of the way this guy treated us, I would never go back. If the restaurant doesn't want to honour a discount, then they shouldn't offer it in the first place. But they sure as hell shouldn't treat their customers poorly just because they take advantage of that discount! And some people really should reconsider being in the hospitality industry when clearly they suck at it."}
{"text":"Dropped by and ordered a Po'boy sandwich to go back to the office. The flavors were all there, but I really wish they used a better bun for a sandwich that came out to be over $10.   The aioli, the battered shrimp, I did enjoy the flavors. It's the salty side for me, but I didn't mind it.   Too much bread or the wrong kind of bread with these ingredients, I tossed out a bit of the bread at the end.  Did you go to the bins at Metro or Loblaws to get your Kaiser Buns? At this price, you would think they would order a good batch of bread from the local bakery but they didn't.   It almost made me want to go to Zoe's for something more traditional or drive up to College to the fish store for a better sandwich."}
{"text":"Cute and small family own Italian restaurant....everything we order was delish  !!! Highly recommend the tagliatelle di manzo and gnocchi con ragu bolonese. They even have an espresso machine! Great service and friendly staff..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and definitely would return.  So far I have tried their Shrimp Po Boy, Meatball Sandwich, Steak Sandwich & Caprese Sandwich (based on sharing with friends). I would also rank the sandwiches in this order with the first two around the same. The sandwiches are great, but 50% of them are bread heavy. The sandwiches range from $7-$10 afaik and come with no side unless you order the special of the day.  For sides I have tried the root salad which I am a huge fan of and their deep fried stuffed olives (kinda what you'd expect this dish to be / taste like).  The restaurant is designed nicely with a great exposed brick look. The only downside to the look of the place is the washrooms in the basement which they clearly didn't put any effort into, but who really cares for a sandwich shop.  At first I thought their prices were on the high end, but with the specials and by ordering one of the cheaper sandwiches, you can get out of here spending under $15 which is in line with the area. I put them as an excellent option if you are looking to get dinner somewhere and don't want to break the bank.  They don't have a liquor license yet but I asked the cashier who said they've been waiting on this since they opened.  I also wrote a more detailed review in my blog with pictures here: http://www.cheapdude.com/food/tavolino-review/"}
{"text":"Solid Italian food with friendly attentive service. We had the carbonara and the linguini with sausage after the grilled calamari app. All very good.   The carbonara had crab meat and an actual egg. And instead of bacon you got chunks of smoky pork belly. The special twists really elevated this dish beyond what you get at your typical Italian resto.   Linguini was also good. Nice light garlic/oil sauce with sun dried tomatoes and rapini was perfect dish for a summer evening. Sausages were tasty but I would have preferred a bit of zing.  Still the ingredients worked really well together and I enjoyed it immensely.   Grilled calamari was good but I prefer a bit more grill marks on the calamari. It looked a tad underdone but the taste was great.   About $40 pp for wine shared app and pasta mains. Reasonable price for good food. Would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"A new addition to this busy king strip, Travolino's serves up an array of sandwiches and salads sure to please all. A trendy decor and soft wood tables give the ambiance and set the mood for a lunch crowd pass You can come, eat and leave all without much hassle.  Now down to the food: my triple AAA beef was spicy and tender. Good choice. The root salad was spectacular, a cheesy explosion of flavored greens. The porkloin sandwich had a texture quite unique giving that sandwich a crunch which was delightful.  Would I come back? Yes."}
{"text":"* * * CLOSED FOR BUSINESS * * *  Tavolino has been closed for at least two months.  I've been there for lunch and had the pochetta sandwich, which was very tasty with juicy tender strips of pork with the tasty crunch of cracklins in a well baked ciabatta roll, however for $10 I expected a little something else with my sandwich like a side salad or some gourmet chips, not just a couple olives. Eating it there the sandwich was placed on a large plate which made the sandwich so much more sad looking.  Service was very friendly and couretous, however it took some time for my sandwich to come out considering the restaurant had only two other diners. The atmosphere is sparse, clean and modern which really emphasize how empty the restaurant really is. There are a ton of sandwich and burger places in the area which offers just as tasty options for much more value, so I'm not surprised that Tavolino didn't last."}
{"text":"Looking for the best meatball sandwich in Toronto? Why would you settle for anything less? Perhaps you have low self-esteem? Will this entire review be questions? What is this an improv game? Let's stop.  Tavolino is a Very Good sandwich shop at King St and Portland. Though the space is small, there are a few tables if you want to eat in. Compared to some of their neighbours, Tavolino has an airy and modern vibe. The kitchen and cash are at the back of the restaurant and the staff are inviting and friendly.  But let's get down to beeswax. I really enjoyed their meatball sandwich, and it's probably my favourite in the city. You know how sometimes when you eat a meatball sandwich and those ground-up spheres of animal slide around (as though sentient) and spread out hither and thither sometimes falling right out of the sandwich and ruining your day? Not here.The soft delicious bun holds everything in place. I'd eat mountains of that bread solo, but when wrapped around perfectly-cooked meat and savoury sauce it's a winner.  Beats Reggie's by a mile. Go to here.  Obligatory Title Pun: I don't want nobody baby/If I can't TAV you.  Menu Readability: Someone here has a very interesting chalk printing technique.  Need to mention: Sandwiches are in the $8-10 range.  What this place teaches me about myself: Meatball sandwiches don't have to be geometric conundrums."}
