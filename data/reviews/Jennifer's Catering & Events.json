{"text":"Had lunch at the market w my favorite foodie friends on Thursday.  We have already planned our return visit when we get back in town in 2weeks.  The food and service is excellent.  We each ordered a dish and they split each dish 4 ways so could sample everything!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Jennifer's catered our wedding rehearsal dinner in my parents' home. They did a fantastic job, and there was almost no clean up needed afterward! We had a wonderful southwestern spread that everyone enjoyed. They accommodated vegetarian and gluten free needs. The food was delicious and the servers were friendly and helpful. They packed up the leftovers at the end of the night so very little went to waste."}
{"text":"We love the food at Jennifer's market but our catering experience was horrible. We paid over $1100 for 27 ppl and received only 27 pieces of bacon, and the eggs in our souffl√© were green before the event started. It was challenging to get a hold of them and the icing on the cake is that they left their catering equipment at our house with no plan or communication in when they would pick it up. When I called to inquire (bc we were leaving town) they said they couldn't pick it up bc they were too busy. And it felt like they were blaming it on us. The whole thing let us down and was quite the disappointment."}
{"text":"Great food! We order food for a celebration of life for 20 people and ended up with food for about 30 people.  We had the lamb chops, prime rib, chicken breast, pork loin, risotto, chips, veggie tray, meat tray, bread tray, pigs in the blanket, and goat cheese truffles.  Everything tasted fantastic.  Would use this place again."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience every time.  The food is unique and \"to die for\".  The staff is always so friendly and attentive.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"We had brunch at this cozy little gem last week. Sat on their patio with our Dog in tow. The food was as good as we expected it to be. (They catered a party for our daughter last November that was very delicious and well executed.) Of course, we'll return. Patio is quite narrow- not really comfortable for more than 3 in a party. Yes Mikey, we really liked it!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. The service was good, very pleasant people. The food was okay - we ordered a burger which was over cooked and lacked flavor. The crab mac and cheese was very tasty. It was very expensive for a lunch for two adults and one 3 year old ($50) without alcohol. Three stars."}
{"text":"Me and my mother stopped in today.  She's lived in the area for many years and this is where I grew up.  Needless to say we've watched this place grow to what it is. I was curious.   Awkward greeting but pleasant none the less.  The server was prompt but when inquiring about a few things his responses were \"that's good\" \" Yea I like that\" no enthusiasm no extra knowledge.  As I was in to purchase a bottle of wine and looking at the wine list he paid no attention to what I was doing or wanted.  His only question was do we have any questions...  And even then his answers were curt and disengaged.  I've been in the fine dining industry for years now and I've also managed many fast paced but quality food restaurants.  It was unfortunate this servers selling abilities lacked and his connection with the customers was not only robotic but uncomfortable.  His responses to our orders were condescending \" that's all your going to get??\" and overall his service seemed forced.  With a cute place and such strong ownership I expected a better experience.. Kudos to the kitchen! the food was amazing. I would not recommend an early Friday lunch to anyone.  But because the food was amazing I will be back to try dinner."}
{"text":"The food is super good and the place is cute.  But every time I go to Jennifer's, the service is horrid!  I keep going back because it is so cute but I leave I wondering why I came back.  I have been here many times and every time I have to ask for more water or my check etc.  If you don't mind asking a lot and having zero water in your glass and have time to hang it is cute and yummy.  If the service would kick up that lil place would be awesome."}
