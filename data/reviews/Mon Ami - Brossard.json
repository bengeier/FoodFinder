{"text":"Impromptu stop at this location that once used to be an infamous local family owned pizza joint (RIP Leo's Pizza). I was impressed with how crowded this venue was for its recent opening. It doesn't come as a surprise the Asian community is very strong in the South Shore. Past businesses never did well in this location- but this was a change. The wait was around 20 mins before we got a table- the staff seemed overwhelmed and they didn't take your name down to keep priority of order of people coming in. 

When we got our table- service was quick. We were given water right away and our menus. We ordered 2 grape sodas, the steamed dumplings (8 pieces- very good!), 2 servings of rice cake (Tteokbokki on a stick was slathered on with a ketchupy sauce- I didn't like it); the main course- I ordered the bulgogi hot bowl (good for one person- ask for hot sauce for a kick- I enjoyed this dish a lot).

I was hoping to try the fried chicken with cheese fondue dip but was given fried chicken with shredded cheese in a skillet instead! So disappointing! I told the waiter the dish we were served did not remotely look like the dish that was displayed in the menu. He apologized. The owner of the resto mentioned the menus are printed unanimously from the downtown locations- so the fondue dish is served at the Cote-De-Neige location. (False advertisement? or at least update the menus according to location!).  

My friend whom had ordered take out the night before from this place also had her ordered screwed up-she was missing a fried chicken dish- so she picked it up the day we dined in. When she asked the waitress to inquire about if the chicken was ready -she was told to do it herself!!!! Customer service? hello? Simply put rude!
The owner was very empathetic though and gave her complimentary drinks which was nice.

Rating my whole experience, I thought the food was very authentic Korean and has merit- but the service and organization of this place needs MAJOR IMPROVEMENT!! I will be keeping the downtown locations in mind- I am still craving the chicken with cheese fondue!"}
{"text":"Love the Mon ami in summerland! And I'm so glad they opened one in south shore. Although that bad cause I'll be getting fat so often lol. They offer Ã€ la carte on one end of the restaurant and all you can eat buffet on the other. The service we had was good and food quality was good as well. They do take reservations now. Bathrooms are also clean as well. And they also have all you can drink soda.

My only 2 comments would be: 1- To make sure all the staff members know what's the items on the menu. There was a waiter who couldn't answer if they had plum Sochu. Which IMO,if you work there you should know. 
2-the quantity needs to reflect the number someone writes down. On paper I asked for Salmon sashimi 2 times. It came in a small portion of about 9-10 pieces. Ordered another wrote 9 times, and they still came with the same portion as when I had written 2 of 9-10 pieces of sashimi. Didn't make sense at all. 
But nevertheless it's a good place that's exactly like the one I Montreal! I'd defiantly go back again!"}
{"text":"Really really long wait. They don't take reservations and on site take out took us 80 minutes to get our food... When they told us 40 minutes... That last plate  delayed the whole order so our food are not as hot or fresh anymore. The parking is so small also. Terrible location. Don't think I'll be back. This is sad because the food is probably decent when eaten on site."}
{"text":"I came to this place 2 times since it opened. I haven't gone to the other locations so I can't compare them.

The first time I went was after work on a Thursday at about 5:45pm. The second time was right when it opened at 4pm on a Saturday, making it really easy to get a seat. It looked like it became really full and the wait started at about 7-7:30pm.

Food wise it's nothing too special, the soft tofu stew wasn't spicy at all.

The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. It comes with a salad, but no sauce for the chicken, it has to be ordered separately.

Seafood pancake was a better choice than the kimchi pancake.

The dolsot bibimbap was good. But if you're buying it as take out, make sure to check if they gave you the spicy gochujang with it, they forgot it from my take out.

The place may be small but we were able to have 9 people sit together at 1 table.

Overall it is a good place if you're craving Korean food. It is pretty cheap if you're going as a large group and ordering a bit of everything for everyone to try."}
{"text":"Being Korean I was so excited that a Korean restaurant was opening here in Southshore. We went to this restaurant once since the opening but now the waiting line is way too long! Until 8:30 pm at least. It's impossible for us to dine there anymore  when we would go at least once a week. The food was good, Too bad. I guess We need to give them time to organize them selves since they only just opened."}
{"text":"If you are a fried chicken lover, you need to try korean fried chicken. I tried few places in montreal and my favorite place is Mon Ami. The original place is on NDG and they are expanding very fast: in montreal and south shore. I was so happy when i knew they were opening one in Brossard, 5 minutes way from my place (can be dangerous for me)! The recipe is exactly the same at each location. The fried chicken is CRISPY, CRISPY CRISPY, light not oily at all. So you can each alot without feeling heavy because of the excess fat. 
In Brossard they are offering AYCE korean bbq which has alot of items, very quality. The best are fried chicken (AYCE!!!), the Kalbi and the blackbean noodle miam! The weekend you can have salmon sashimi, good quality and fresh.
I travelled in the USA and eaten different style of fried chicken and i have to say Mon Ami is on my top list.
The service is good and friendly. The place is busy so for a group make sure you reserve in advance."}
{"text":"The restaurant opened today so a bunch of us went to be testers for the rest of our friends who doesn't want to go on opening day without discount. (they are smart...us not so much). 

They definitely need to work on the service and the food. Today's food was not as good at their other Mon Ami in NDG.......there were not even the rice cake bits on our fried chicken.....fail. Also the chicken is not as good as the one in NDG.

Service was a bit slow and they seemed a bit lost. Also the power to their coffee machine and fridge broke....so no free coffee as advertised......

It's still decent fried chicken just not as good as their other place."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Thursday noon, wasn't really crowded here, but the service is still a bit slow. The menu is similar with the other Mon Ami restaurants in Montreal, the choices of dishes are quite varied and price fair enough. My biggest problem with this Mon Ami is the taste, it is really different from the mother branch at NDG, which is excellent. Even though the bibimbap of Mon Ami never wow me, but the one at Mon Ami Brossard is way worse than most bibimbap that I tried so far. Their cheese corn is good, as well as their spicy seafood soup, but not amazing. I would say that it is not my greatest Korean meal, but acceptable, would I go back? Unlikely."}
{"text":"All u can eat korean BBQ with reasonable price, i like the bulgogi and the fried chicken, with beer of course."}
