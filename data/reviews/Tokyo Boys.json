{"text":"Really expensive but high quality sushi. Appetizer Tako Wasabi is very fresh and delicious. Comfortable atmosphere. Looks like it used to be a diner of some sort but they did a good job with decor. Love coming here with my husband to spend some quality time. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I lived in Tokyo, Japan, for three years, and have spent a lifetime traveling there.  So the highest praise I can give Tokyo Boys is this:  despite the name and the building it was located in (both of which had me expecting mall food-court quality \"Japanese\"  food), the sushi and gyoza I had here was every bit as good as any I had in upscale restaurants in Japan.  It was truly spectacular!  I look forward to trying their hire katsu next time, and if that is as good as what I had in the motherland, then they'll have earned a customer for life!"}
{"text":"As long as i live in vegas , there will not be another Japanese Sushi restaurant that compares to Hiro's. The staff is very professional and polite. Food is always consistent and is fresh! Not frozen! Real crab meat! This restaurant has been open for 3 years and might not have the traditional Japanese look , but its clean and the Food is definitely OUTSTANDING. Thank you Hiro for your hard work and thank the crew for their hard work and great customer service!"}
{"text":"This was the best experience we have had coming to Las Vegas! The wait staff was amazing. Everyone was so friendly and attentive. Our sushi was great too!! Our drinks never needed to wait on a refill she just refilled them. It is definitely worth the drive off the strip. Phenomenal all around!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, I usually go around midnight, let's start off by saying the hours are a plus! The food is great, I usually get the bento box special with the chicken katsu which is AMAZING! Very satisfying and the service here is great! It's usually really empty when I go but the servers always offer the best service. Try their sushi as well, it's really good! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great service! I ordered green tea to drink and my waitress always made sure my cup was not empty! The food is delicious, and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, great vibe, great staff! This is our go to place for sushi. Their rice in particular is exquisitely executed, flavor and texture is divine."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Price is fair. But they have \"no high volume policy\", according to the waitress. Which totally ruins my mood. But ok, I won't come here ever again. They said, service is the face of the restaurant, totally correct. I was told to turn my phone down a little bit, first I thought it was because the other customer complained about me, then she told me \"we have policy against that\". Ok, first, this isn't luxury restaurant, 2nd, you don't tell your customers what to do. If the policy exists, I respect, if not, then fuck it."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! The food here is delish, and the service here is good. This place is perfect if you have family from out of town coming, or just want a great Asian place. It is pretty casual, and is very relaxing. I am by no means a Japanese connoisseur, but the food here is fantastic, as far as I can tell."}
{"text":"After 3 visits, I feel qualified to recommend this place highly.''
'
The food and service were very good.

If it wasn't in an old chrome diner shell and spent a little more on décor, I'd give it a 5."}
{"text":"We have known Hiro san for a while and he is the best Sushi chef in Vegas area. The quality of Fish is the same as the one from very expensive high end Sushi place on the Strip. Very authentic nigiri sushi as well as yummy creative rolls!! Also try some other small Japanese dish, especially handmade Gyoza,  all Hiro san's original, excellent!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. Me & my friend went there to place a take out order. The waitress wasn't that nice , didn't offer water while we were waiting ... Pretty much when we left we were disappoint. The Japanese lasagna barely had any cheese on it,when I asked about it and requested more cheese, well I'll post a picture and let you be the judge of that... The other roles that I ordered are SPICY which I was TRYING TO AVOID!  Oh gosh.. So disappointed ... Didn't even eat my food."}
{"text":"Who needs Jiro when you have Hiro (et al.)!

This place is only around 3 months old, but I've probably been here at least 6 times. Each time makes me want to go back for more. The staff is incredibly friendly, helpful, and unpretentious - the hostesses and chef/owner easily remember me and make me feel right at home. 

The food is very, very good - I would even say \"oishii\". Their cooked dishes and sushi are equally amazing. For the cooked dishes, I'm a big fan of the chicken karaage, salt and pepper shrimp, and the grilled black cod. With the sushi, I like to try 2 or 3 specials each time and then will get a couple rolls. The fish is definitely high quality and served perfectly. 

The menu has a good mix of authentic Japanese and some new dishes with their own personal spin. Each dish is well-balanced and their menu and execution seems like they really spent time thinking through it.

The decor is very nice and clean, and I'm a big fan of the eclectic music (Johnny Cash, Thievery Corporation, etc all in one sitting). 

Overall, I'm so happy that it's in Henderson - I'd still go frequently if it were in Vegas, but I'm thankful for its proximity. The food and the staff are the best and I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I saw all the fantastic reviews on here and thought this place would be awesome for lunch today.

The fish for the sushi was sitting out on plates, wrapped in Saran Wrap. There was no ice or refrigeration visible anywhere on it. It was this way before we got there and remained that way after we left. I assume that is just how they roll.

So...yay for dangerous raw food temps!

I got 2 spicy tuna rolls. Ordering a spicy tuna  roll at a sushi place is like getting a burger at McDonald's. It is the basic roll. Common, you should know what to expect. 

These rolls I got were loose, the fish was warmish, the spicy sauce was dribbled over the roll and not inside, and there was nothing else in the roll at all except tuna. It was bland and bad-tasting. 

I also got tempura shrimp & veggies. These weren't awful, but they were nothing special. In all honesty they were a little under fried.

My wife got some sort of shrimp dish with jalapeños on it. There was not enough good for her. We had to get tacos afterwards. And no, she isn't large and is not a big eater.

Did these guys PAY for the good reviews?? 

Stay away!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth it! The sushi chefs were very nice! I asked him if he had crispy rice, but they didn't :( 
But he made it for me anyways and it was so yummy :) 
Everything there was absolutely stupendous, I would for sure come back again."}
{"text":"The best kept secret in all of Southern Nevada is this little piece of Tokyo in Henderson.  Camouflaged in an old diner building, you'll be overly stimulated by the exquisite food.  The freshness of their fish and the care they present in preparation is defined by every dish.  

We enjoyed plates of nigiri-salmon, yellowtail, A hamachi Kama, sake chazuke, agedashi tofu and the most amazing house made desserts.  All so authentic and presented beautifully.  We highly recommend the green tea cheesecake, black sesame Panama cotta and the yuzu sorbet.     

All in all,  an exceptional experience, a tremendous value and a delicious go to spot for sushi and Japanese cuisine.  

P.s. We frequent this spot and the service is fabulous!"}
{"text":"So my wife  is a big fan of Sushi and we decided to have a family dinner on Sunday night so we went there for the fist time, we'll let's just say it was probably the worst decision we made. My wife ended having food poisoning, I had to take her to the hospital Monday morning so she missed work and she also missed work Tuesday ..so thanks because we spent a nice amount of money that night and also she missed 2 days of work and she will not be paid for that."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place 5 times and never a bad meal !! The service it great very friendly and after living in Japan for two years this is just as good. Try it you will return!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Chef Hirofumi is amazing.  We were driving in Henderson and saw this place.  Friendly staff and beautiful restaurant.  We tried the beef teriyaki and shrimp tempura sushi among others and everything tasted fresh and original.  

Will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough. Absolutely wonderful service from Hiro and all staff. Incredible food! Don't let the diner exterior fool you--you will not be disappointed. Buttery o-toro and chu-toro, A5 wagyu sushi. Unexpected, but pleasantly surprised and thoroughly satisfied. In two words: love it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! This will be our new spot for sure! Great prices. Like really great prices! Great roll selection for the standard sushi lover, they do lack the over the top selection rolls but I actually prefer that. No one wants to stare a menu of book-long madness to choose a roll, and end up feeling like you've read an entire dissertation to make a choice. So moral of the story is, this place rocks, so go here!"}
{"text":"Came here while visiting from California. Food was not good at all. My spicy tuna was warm! Actually all of our food that was supposed to be cold was warm. It smelt really gross in the restaurant too like bad fish. Fresh fish isn't supposed to smell fishy like that. Anybody who knows good sushi knows that. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese sushi bar and restaurant with full menu of cooked entrées."}
{"text":"Five star quality sushi. Sashimi!

I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!

Try the collar, yes they have it there!"}
{"text":"My Family and I love to eat Japanese food on almost a weekly basis. Japanese cuisine is by far our favorite. We normally have to drive to the west side as we do not really enjoy any of the local places. It was a nice surprise to finally find a place closer to my house that met our expectations. 
This restaurant has authentic Japanese cuisine. The quality of their products are on par with restaurants on the strip at affordable prices. The decor is not Japanese and does not serve justice to the place. It is extremely clean and kept very fresh. Our town needs more family owned and operated restaurants like this that have a home feel unmatched by the big corporation places. 
Definitely try their oysters, tempura uni, monkfish liver, pork belly and their amazing sushi. My daughter and I went with Omakase Menu and enjoyed every course. The menus also have more conservative alternatives for people like my wife, that are equally delicious. The check would have been a lot more at some of the other places we usually go to and it is closer to us. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Kinda weird for a Japanese place to be in a diner ....food was expensive and not that great.   If I'm paying these prices I want good quality.   I'd pass on this place"}
{"text":"Average and a bit overpriced, especially for Henderson. The server and chef were very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Tokyo boys has only quality fish. I love the diner converted into sushi bar. The price although not cheap but fairly priced for quality fish. Your gonna spend way more on strip and fish is not as good. Wide variety of sashimi. Grade AAA fish.  My new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Holy Fresh. This fish is unbelievable. Try everything. Eat it all. Eat it slowly. This is sushi done right, with the freshest possible ingredients. 

That tuna though... The best."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for dinner. The food was great. It had a Japanese feel to it that wasn't too much but have enjoyed. The food was delicious! I highly recommend checking them out. Very filling."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was delicious, the staff was very helpful and the restaurant was clean. 

I would recommend trying the jalapeño poppers. Lol, I know, it wasn't a typo or my phones auto correct. When my husband first ordered it I was like seriously?!? 

WOW, was I happy he did. Its a jalapeño cut in half, filled with tuna and cream cheese and then fried. It is NOT breaded so it's not the typical jalapeño poppers; which I probably will never go back to the regular jalapeño poppers again  (sorry Sonic). These things were like an explosion of yummyness in your mouth!"}
{"text":"I usually go to All you can eat sushi when I crave for sashimi... Heard of this place, not all you can eat and a bit pricey... Finally gave it try. OMG! My money is totally worth it!! Especially the $75 sashimi... the fish is so fresh and just melts in my mouth! The portion is good but I just wish I could have another plate of that!! Anyone who loves sashimi has to try this place!!! Highly recommend~"}
{"text":"Las Vegas has a so many cheap AYCE ... 
But almost place owner, sushi chef is not Japanese . Every other AYCE place is same .....( I still go to AYCE when I hungry and I wanna eat a lot ) 

This place has a Japanese Chef so its better ...! 
Taste better .... !! 
I can trust behind kitchen !
Yes I like it !!"}
{"text":"Salmon was pretty good. Nice, fast service. Went on Mothers Day with my daughter and didn't have to wait. Was nice after a long day at work. Sushi was also pretty good and fresh."}
{"text":"Unquestionably, this is the BEST sushi restaurant you will find in the Las Vegas area. Chef Hiro takes great pride in his craft, and it shows in his cuisine. The focus is more traditional Japanese cuisine than fusion elements (I.e. nigiri and maki vs some \"I love my ass\" role you'll find at ayce establishments), however you'll still be able to get the latter as desired.

It is important to note that Tokyo Boys is not AYCE, and as such you'll spend more here. In return, you'll get a right & proper meal. The fish is fresh and never frozen, and much of it arrives the same day from Japan via Honolulu (they use the same suppliers as many of the $$$$ sushi establishments on the Strip). I suspect that the (very few) negative reviewers don't take this into account, and may not have a true appreciation for the genuine article. Their loss.

Overall, Tokyo Boys is a true gem in the Las Vegas valley. That it's housed in a former 50s diner just adds to its charm. Give Hiro and his crew a try. You'll love them."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place!!  Freshest fish I have had in vegas. The chef actually cut the hamachi in front of us, it was a actual fish. Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem, authentic food. Service could be better but I think it is hard to staff when they don't have many who make reservation. All in all very good."}
{"text":"First adventure here, the atmosphere is marvelous, would be an excellent business meeting spot.  The service is impeccable, their Sake and Draft offerings are delightful.  Tori Karage is fantastic and I couldn't keep out of it.  My wife and I split the 24 piece chef's Sashimi plate and the selections, including fatty tuna, mackerel, jack, and others along with a tempura fish was more than adequate for two.  You must try the fresh wasabi, nothing like you will find in most restraints in town.  If you leave here hungry or not satisfied its your own fault.  Also the crime brûlée for desert was marvelous.  We will return.  FYI plan to eat what you order no take home boxes so no tummies for later."}
{"text":"Excellent! Family owned business. Hiro has worked in Salt Lake City, Nobu at the Hard Rock and now he and his wife Junko are their own restauranteurs. The fish is fresh from Japan, arriving within 24 hours of being caught. The menu is varied; sashimi, sushi, and other things like Japanese fried chicken, New York steak, and hand made pot stickers. Junko makes the featured desserts. The green tea cheesecake is wonderful. 
This is a great spot for a nice meal for a couple or for a meal for 12. Hiro will \"design\" the food for your party, leaving the decision making to him. Tonight we had the fresh sashimi and two rolls. Everything was seasoned well, the fish was fresh, and the service was outstanding. Make this your \"go to\" place when you're thinking having authentic sushi."}
{"text":"Great, fresh sushi and friendly preparers. But the help needs help.
They have gotten our check wrong and ignored our to-go orders until we point them out.
If you want to sit at the bar, they will move \"Reserved\" signs around so that though there are vacant stools you will always be seated next to someone when there are lots of vacancies(?).
Advice: Go there and enjoy but insist on your own seating and have the guys behind the bar do all of your orders. Also, check your check!"}
{"text":"Friggen delicious sushi. Amazing gyoza. Totally legit chef. Funky diner decor and wicked music. We had a blast here - and will be coming back when we return to Vegas! Thanks guys for great food and service."}
{"text":"I saw the 4-1/2 stars & told my family we should try it.  We drove up & were taken a little aback by the building; it looks like an old diner.  We took a couple of mins to discuss then went for it.  We were glad we did!

Service - wonderful & friendly.  Our waitress made sure we were enjoying our food, & our drinks were always filled without a request from us.

Food - delicious!  Fresh & flavorful fish, very well-prepared & presented.

We will definitely go back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating but I give it a five !! The best service and Food!!! Great quality fish"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars on their quality alone! No, there isn't any \" all you can eat\" and if cheap trendy all you can eat rolls are what you want, this is NOT your new spot. If you understand Japanese food & fish and like quality, fresh, authentic sushi then welcome home!!! 

There are only a few additions I would like to see. A television for football games and the like at the sushi bar is one suggestion. The other is the closure between lunch and dinner. It is somewhat confusing and we often find ourselves wanting to come here during that time but must go elsewhere... 

Perhaps a giant \"grand opening\" sign with streamers would go a long way. Many people still think this place is the (old sushi spot)."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. I was happy to see that it was open so late at night. I sat down and the place was empty. But the sushi chef Hiro quickly made myself feel at home. I've been to many places in town and they had quite an impressive selection of sushi. Keep up the good work Hiro!!"}
{"text":"For my birthday, I wanted sushi. We decided to try a new place. I had found Tokyo Boys on here, and it looked promising, so we gave it a try.

We were seated and given menus immediately. The selection wasn't great, but the prices were decent. Full rolls ranging from 4.99 to 15, with options to deep fry or bake for 2 dollars more. 

The service was not good. We sat for 30 minutes before the server came back for beverage order. We informed him then that we were ready to order our food. He said okay and rushed off. 10 minutes later we still hadn't been waited on. We had to grab him again and finally he sent over the female waitress to take our order. The best part is, we were one of maybe 4 or 5 tables in the whole place being served. There was a group of 10 next to us being served actively, food, beverage, and bottles of sake. I hate to say it, but to me it seemed they were more interested in them because a) they were spending a lot of money and b)the racial difference, they were laughing and speaking in japanese, and maybe they were regulars? It just really seemed they didn't care about us because of a racial difference. 

As far as the food goes, it was delicious. I got two rolls that were both pretty satisfying. Even the iced tea was delicious (I'm picky about my iced tea). Unfortuneately, the food wasn't enough to trump the terrible service.

1 star for service, 4 stars for food, so I averaged 2 stars. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"My stepmother and step brothers and sisters are Japanese American. They know their sushi. Their only complaint is that the place was once a trendy diner. But they always insist eating here at least once when they visit. Luckily, Tokyo Boys is close by. I've tried just about everything on their menu and it has always been excellent. The crab sushi roll is spectacular. The sushi, in general, is always fresh and delicious. My only regret is that they are no longer open for lunch because a bento box is perfect for a casual lunch. The beef and chicken teriyaki is very good, although not much different than what is found i most Japanese restaurants. The service is lean, but efficient. The Japanese beer is extremely cold. It's best if you ask the waitress what the chef is recommending that evening because they serve only what is freshly available. So, some days they have blue fin, other days it may be yellow fin. They almost always have nigiri. Did I mention the incredibly cold Japanese beer. It's cold. 

To summarize, the place is excellent for the price and not prissy or stuffy like the places on the strip. It's priced right."}
{"text":"Tried this on the recommendation of a co-worker.  We won't be back.  Severely over priced for very little food.  The best thing I can say is my husbands very small steak was pretty tasty, however that doesn't make a meal and for the price of it there should have been more than a 4 Oz piece or other things to go along with it.  I have the yellow tail with ponzu (some of the poorest ponzu I've ever had).


And iced tea from concentrate, might as well have been drinking tin can.  

Save your time and money choose a different restaurant."}
{"text":"three of us had lunch here.
They have lunch special only $8.99, we can choose sashimi, tempura, tonkatsu, etc.
We enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant since 2014 where I left my first positive review. Unfortunately today I left as an unhappy customer who will never patronage this restaurant again. I ordered curry with white rice. Only to find 1 piece of beef and potato in the dish. I addressed this with the owner who is the server as well. They did nothing so I said you are willing to lose a long term customer for a few pieces of beef and potato? This was based upon the principle of making it right. My husband I spend an average of $70 each time and never complained. Oh well, I guess they do not care if they lose a customer or not."}
{"text":"Okay, so i was having a rough day & my bf told me to get comfy that he was taking me out to eat. I literally left the house in a jeans and a t-shirt. The environment is so humble! The sushi chefs are AMAZING ! The SERVICE is the best ! And their food! Their food.... Their food is so pure. If you like good sea food ! Go ! We got the $75 sashimi platter & trust me, we will go back for the $100 one. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"I love your restaurant because you make the best sushi. My name is Jaxon and I am 7 years old. I eat a lot of sushi and I love yours the best! Hiro the chef is so nice. We love sitting at the counter so we can watch them."}
{"text":"Tokyo boys is a gem! It is affordable high grade sushi, not cheap, but very affordable for the quality. I have waited awhile to write a review because I wanted to have pictures to add to it, here's the problem with that, We literally always start mobbing our food and forget to take the picture. Haha it's ridiculous it's happened so many times and even now the pics I am posting will not be all of the food we actually ordered and devoured, but better than nothin right?
They have high quality green tea, matcha, and they refill with no extra cost, ok snooze I know but had to include it. We love love the takosu, it's cucumber cut beautifully and meticulously to soak up the sweet rice vinegar, a little bit of seaweed salad and tender tako (octopus). This tako got the deep tissue massage, it's not that tough stuff you'll find at cheaper sushi joints, just soft and chewy, with lemon. Beautiful! So beautiful we eat it before we think to take a picture. Off of the sushi menu my bf always gets the garlic tuna, which looks amazing, he assures me it is, but I can't indulge due to an allergy. I always get the hamachi Kama, or amberjack Kama if they are out, it is sooo good. In case you don't know Kama is the \"collar\" of a fish, and it is delicious. It's a soft white fish, moist with some fattier parts by the bones. It melts in your mouth. It comes grilled with a slightly crispy skin and moist tender inside. Served with finely chopped green onion, lemon and a ponzu sauce I believe. That one is a winner. My bf gets the rib eye steak off of the grill menu with the teriyaki sauce, the sauce comes on the side and the steak comes out sizzling on a cast iron skillet. It's always cooked wonderfully and he loves their sauce as well. We've tried a few desserts which were all tasty, I recommend the yuzu sorbet. It is light and refreshing, perfect ending to a meal."}
{"text":"just had the agedashi tofu, a cucumber roll, and an avocado roll, and they were all so amazing! the restaurant is open through late hours so I was able to come in and order my food to-go at 1230pm (after I got off work). the employees greeted me as soon as I walked in and were very friendly. when I arrived at home to eat my food, it was absolutely delicious! the ingredients were so fresh and it was definitely the best japanese food I've had in vegas! tokyo boys is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great service, mackerel and tofu dashi were both really good. Sake prices were a bit much. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The best Japanese restaurant in town!!!  Hiro does an amazing job that keeps my family coming back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi with excellent service!  Have been looking for a good sushi place for a while now and finally found it,  not a lot on the menu but if you don't see what you want they will gladly make it with a smile on their face. Sushi was very fresh....would definitely recommend this place and I know I will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is good. I tried it out for lunch at around 1:30pm. Ordered a bento box lunch special. It was really good. Gyozas were good. Better than Ichiza. Salmon teriyaki was good too. Had Orion beer from okinawa. They served it in one of those sake like glasses. It felt authentic. Then I tried the sushi (bluefin, halibut, and salmon). Also good. This place is big time. Don't compare it to Kabuto in Chinatown. If you just want straight up good food without anything fancy, then this is the place."}
{"text":"I only ate here once and only had appetizers. It was good but expensive and didn't really get much."}
{"text":"Love this place you have to come and try it out.  We came in from out of town and found a wonderful surprise!  Hirosan was wonderful with us and the sushi was super fresh and so good!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant I have ever ate at. I had the combo bowl with a bunch of different type of fish. They were amazingly fresh!! They fly in their fish everyday from Japan but they tasted like they just fished them out of the sea. The bowl was 28 dollars but very worth it and a very good deal for what you get. The waitresses are very polite. I will definitly be back"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Will definitely return soon. This is an absolute must try for anyone who enjoys japanese food. It's also open late night for everyone like myself who craves japanese food late, but doesn't want to drive to China Town for some late night eats."}
{"text":"I signed up on Yelp specifically to write a review about this restaurant. The service was amazing, the sushi was first rate, and we will definitely be back. 

If you're looking for a place that serves melt in your mouth sushi, I highly recommend Tokyo Boys."}
{"text":"Moving to the desert from the coast, I wondered whether there'd be an affordable place to have fresh sushi. This place is legit. It looks like a 50s diner on the outside, but inside, you instantly travel to Japan. The food is super fresh and you can tell just by the taste that the chef/ owners really care about the authenticity of what they serve. Although the prices are on the higher side compared to other places in the area, it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, so fresh it's cut right off the whole fish in front of you! ! Best hamachi kama I've ever had!  Thanks Hiro!"}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant experience at Tokyo Boys. The outside appearance is misleading because instead this diner is an authentic Japanese restaurant (or very close to being authentic according to a Japanese friend). It's not too busy during lunchtime so if you're in the area and craving Japanese, Tokyo Boys is a good choice.

I had the oyakodon which is a rice bowl with chicken marinated in soy sauce mixed in with eggs. This is a very simple dish that is brings together my favorite ingredients. The flavor was just right and the soy sauce was very light, so I was able to taste the freshness of the steamed rice and the juiciness of the chicken. I wasn't too hungry so the oyakodon was all I ate, but it was more than filling.

The wait staff is friendly and attentive. The restaurant itself was very clean and organized.

Overall I would come back to Tokyo Boys, and best of all is that it's open until 2 AM every day, so Japanese cuisine is always an option."}
{"text":"We have driven by this place numerous times, but were a bit confused (and turned off) by the diner motif.  Big mistake.  Took the plunge tonight and man, what a treat!  EXCELLENT sushi and gyoza.  Great selection here, from $6.00 sushi rolls to $100 sashimi plates, with everything in between.  Very friendly service, too.  We arrived a few minutes after 5:00 p.m. (when they open) and by 5:30 it was becoming quite crowded. Not only is the diner location quirky, the stereo tunes (Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin... were unexpected.  And enjoyed)  I have heard others talk about true, fresh, sushi and now that I've eaten here I'm not sure I've ever had true, fresh sushi.  Until now.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food is good but the prices are very high. Over all it is a nice place but bring a hand full of cash."}
{"text":"We had a party here for my son's birthday. The food was really good, and the service was excellent. I'd recommend the yellow tail, the Japanese Lasagna, the Tune Poke, the chicken teriyaki, the dragon roll, the tiger roll, and the yum yum roll. My older two sons and I really like sashimi and nigri, but we only ordered a bit of that; as the rest of our party weren't fans. They were very nice about serving the home made pies my Mom made for my son's birthday, even adding and lighting candles. We are all sushi fans. If you like good sushi, we'd recommend it. It's a solid choice if you have a couple, for example, where one person has been eating sushi for many years and enjoys more of the sashimi, etc., and another person who likes to stick with rolls. The menu will please both. The quality of the fish is top notch. The owner is on hand, and oversees the food prep. Cute venue, in an old diner-car-style establishment."}
{"text":"Great food! My favorite sushi restaurant as it is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out Tokyo Boys since I've been looking for a good Japanese restaurant and have passed by it several times. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. The food was very bland. I got the pork and cabbage dish. The cabbage had no flavor and tasted as if it were only boiled in water. What ever happened to some seasoning? The small and thin slices of pork had no flavor and were dry. They provided a dipping sauce, but I didn't like it since it was too vinegary. I was then looking forward to the kaukuni (pork belly), but that was also dried out. The meat had been simmering in the broth for too long. I did like the agedashi tofu, but I think that's hard to mess up. The service wasn't great, and we had to ask twice for more drinks/refills since the waitress never came by to check on us. I don't know how this place got so many rave reviews. My friend also did not care for the food and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"My favorite Japanese restaurant in Henderson! Very fresh sushi and wonderful cooked appetizers and entrees"}

{"text":"Hands down one of the best if not the best sushi in Nevada.  Hiro San's skills he picked up working at some of the best joints like Nobu and other 5 star restaurants for years really reflects in the freshness, presentation, and combination of his dishes. 

I came here all the way from Southern California just to have Omakase with Hiro.  What a jewel of a place. Clean, cool, and hip with Ritz like personable service.  

If you are coming to Vegas for work or play just take Uber or Lyft for $17.  It's worth every penny as you will save more than 50% of what you would spend on the strip for double the quality of what you get at the top joints there."}
{"text":"I've been avoiding this place for years because it looks like some weird Asian fusion place, with it's strange diner interior and 'Tokyo Boys' sounding like a Japanese boy band... but one day I ventured in and was so surprised at the menu. This place is legit!!! Look at photos for the menu, none of those nonsense experimental American rolls with deep fried cream cheese or whatever. This place is for actual nigiri and classic roll lovers.. and other traditional Japanese food. Highly recommended! Prices are good too!"}
{"text":"this isn't AYCE fatty! free edamame? gtfo you scrub! but if you're looking to finally taste sushi this is it. the nigiris are perfectly proportioned and the rolls aren't drowned in sauce. and you can't leave without trying a handroll. spider crab! 
owner/chef Hiro-san definitely has a passion for making sushi. sit at the bar and you'll see what i mean."}

{"text":"Highly recommend this place. It's only been open for 6 months and we drove by it almost everyday. I was skeptical at first cause it's in a diner. But the inside is beautiful and we sat at the granite bar in front of the sushi chef/owner. Great decision. We were able to dialogue with him and got some sushi recommendations.

Over all the fish is HIGH quality and prepared beautifully.
What we got:
Sapporo and house saki= :)
 
Madai-Japanese snapper-5/5 Lemon and salt so good
Shima aji-4/5-simply for my own preference for softer fish
Benitoro-seared salmon belly-5/5 
Spicy tuna best ever. Quality fish and great spicy tuna roll-5/5

Will be back next sushi craving night. Also thinking of coming back for the kitchen items."}
{"text":"The right combination of Japanese authenticity and customized menu suited to the local neighborhood. The food is delectable and accessible at the same time. Matched with the gracious hospitality of the wait-staff, this Japanese restaurant remains the #best_sushi_bar for the wife @Ohana4Mama and me."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite sushi restaurant! I love the 1950's American diner look and as soon as you walk through the door, you automatically travel to Japan. The Chef Hiro is very kind and friendly. I drive 50 minutes to an hour out of my way, just to eat here. (depending on traffic). The fish is fresh, the beer and sake are delicious plus the staff is attentive. Try their desserts as well! This place never disappoints. Great little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"No UNI today - I guess I should have called ahead? We wanted to try it out... Just average at best. Short sushi roll selection. We will not be going back... I approve this message J K Kuhl"}
{"text":"Food is good but its expensive.. very expensive..

The rolls are smaller compared to other jap restaurants i have been. Its like half the size of other rolls.. 

It wasn't busy at all, maybe 3 tables with 2-4 people but service is little slow.. 

I could go to different sushi place same quality of food as this one for a lesser price

Wont come back for the reason that it is expensive"}
{"text":"It was surprisingly good considering that it had the setting was a diner type place for sushi. Kind of on the expensive end for what I thought it was still good"}
{"text":"Waited forever to just have my order taken (15mins). They kept sitting people but others guests but NO ONE WAS TAKING ORDERS! Meanwhile the sushi chefs were just standing by waiting to work watching the room fill up with no orders! Maybe our girl was just slow because the other waitress was on top of it.....
HORRIBLE SERVICE DON'T BOTHER EATING HERE...."}
{"text":"Wife and I love this place.   They have great fresh sushi.  Try out the garlic sushi.... to die for.   Excellent service and food is awesome."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, service was great.  If you're gluten free this place uses a potato based starch to prepare your favorite sushi.   Excellent sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Will never come back here again! It took them a while before anyone could even get our drink orders and every time we ask for something. There were only 3 people on the floor. Good thing I was sitting next to their table where they kept all their silverware, condiments etc so I just took them from there rather than waiting forever. Cause I asked for sugar for my iced tea and the server just gave me a single packet.. other reviews were all good so I thought their food must be good. It wasn't. The chicken katsu and beef teriyaki were mediocre and the spider roll wasnt even tasty."}
{"text":"Nobu quality at practically half the price!  This place is an undiscovered gem.  The chef Hiro shops at the fish market every day and won't buy anything that doesn't meet his strictest quality standards.  If you like the typical Vegas AYCE deal with cheap fish and cut corners this place isn't for you.  If you want a sublime sushi experience with the highest quality fish, skillful preparation and an experience your taste buds won't soon forget, this is the place for you.  From traditional edomae-style simplicity to modern fusion sushi creations, this place has a broad range of taste.  I've had some of the best sushi when I was living in LA at spots like Katsuya, Matsu Hisa and Nobus and at the end of the day, I'd prefer this place because even though the decor may be simple and even spartan, all the energy and money goes into the fish and food.  

Try the specials on the whiteboard because those are going to be the daily fresh picks that the chef probably picked up that morning."}
{"text":"Me and my coworkers went here last week. We got the $100 sashimi platter, rib eye steak with garlic sauce, katsudon, curry katsudon, and 3 different types of beers. For dessert we got the Tempura Ice Cream and Green Tea cheesecake. 

The sashimi platter was served on a boat. It was very presentable and very fresh. Very delicious and it doesn't have that fishy yucky taste I dislike in most raw fish dishes. It was kinda expensive, but from what I ate... It was worth it. It was served with fresh grated wasabi.

Everything else we ordered was good. Our server, Junko, was very attentive and nice. 

Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times and I will come back for more. I'm used to Japanese food and I've been to Japan twice and I can tell you this, these guys know how to do it with finesse. They take their time and make it worth to wait. From a simple soup to elaborate rolls and can tell you that the flavor is all there. Congratulation to them for being professional and interested in their customers opinion and taste. This place is a must if you want to know what Japanese food taste like for real. They open only after 5 pm and close late 1 am I think ... So get away from the strip and have a tasteful dinner."}
{"text":"The freshness of the fish and the quality of the sushi here is SOOO good!!
The rice here is ACTUALLY sticky - these guys don't mess around. 

One of the best sushi spots I've eaten at ever!
Trying to not eat anything else for a bit to savor the taste of that ultra fresh hamachi 

I gotta leave this place - the smells are too amazing and are going to drive me crazy 

Yay for Tokyo Boys!"}
{"text":"The sushi is really good! Tempura soba was alright- guess I'm just not a huge fan of soba. 

Service was kinda slow, hence the one star down."}
{"text":"I finally got to check this place out... Totally worth every penny! I ordered to go so the mister could have some. The O-toro and hamachi was melt in your mouth! I've been looking everywhere for ume-shiso and this place has it! It is truly legit Japanese sushi! The man had spicy tuna which he said was super fresh n tasty and the salmon skin hand roll both were broke da mouth delish! Will def be back for more!
Arigato go zaimasu"}
{"text":"Tokyo Boys has some of the freshest sushi in Henderson! Their tokyjyo chirashi bowl is one of the best in town - with sweet shrimp, uni and other premium fish! The tori karaage is crispy and delicious! Service is fast and friendly. I highly recommend the roppongi roll - ask for it extra spicy, for a kick!"}
{"text":"Always great service and great food! I would recommend this place to anyone! They remember us every time we go in. It's reasonably priced and always yummy!"}
{"text":"Don't really have any complaints about this place but the quality of food just isn't the best. The building is really cool though it's like a older style 50's diner. A pretty solid place, I just didn't find the food the most enjoyable."}
{"text":"Have eaten here with the wifey three times. Have enjoyed each meal. Don't let the outside fool you, the inside is really nice and clean. The host is nice and they always acknowledge us when we're there. Of course we've always gone there for lunch around noonish and we're the only ones there lol. I don't know if thats good or bad but I like it cuz we get our food pretty quickly. I always order the Salmon Bento box with teriyaki and it's always excellent. They are a little pricier on their sushi so keep that in mind. If you're really hungry and want to eat a ton of sushi I would strongly recommend going to a buffet style sushi place like Island sushi or Blue Fin. Like me for lunch Ill get a bento box and add a couple pieces of raw Mackerel. I really recommend this place mainly for lunchtime but I'm sure dinner is good too."}
{"text":"Food quality was there but prices are ridiculous... Was turned off on how expensive prices were and how little portions are... Fine dining experience wasn't really there... Service was ok... 

Overall Experience : ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"Easily the best Chirashi bowl I've ever had- and also the most expensive, at $30, but worth it. There were 20+ varieties of fish plus eel, tamago, sweet shrimp, and a beautiful, crunchy fried shrimp head, beautifully arranged and absolutely delicious. Chef Hiro admits it's the best deal on the menu, and he's a very friendly guy.

That said, this spot has limited rolls and mostly focuses on fresh sashimi and nigiri- and it's not unusual for the daily specials to run $12-15 an order for specialty fishes. Definitely a spot that can add up quick if you go hungry. 

TIP: Desserts are made in house, don't go without getting one. The parfait-style green tea cheesecake is the specialty, but they also offer a black sesame panacotta."}
{"text":"Abosultely amazing Sushi! I will definitely come back with some of my clients who are looking for AMAZING sushi close to their new home!!"}
{"text":"My husband LOVES this place and couldn't wait to bring me here. The staff was attentive and prices were decent. I do not eat sushi therefore I got the teriyaki chicken and it was very disappointing. It was chargrilled and was overcooked/dry. Needless to say I won't be coming back with him again. 3 stars for the sushi he loves so much."}
{"text":"Bar none the freshest and best sushi I've ever had. Looks like a 50's diner. Weird building for a sushi joint but who cares!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Definitely order a lot of those fish tacos! We got the tuna and yellowtail- so delicious! It had a kick to it but not overwhelming. The Philadelphia roll surprisingly was one of my favorites and I never do like those rolls when I go for sushi. We went around 8:00 at night so past the  dinner crowd. Staff was attentive but a little slow on service. There were only 2 sushi chefs. They should add some free edamame while waiting."}
{"text":"I typically try a sushi restaurant a few times before forming my opinion, but with so many awesome sushi options in Vegas, I prob won't be back to Tokyo Boys :(

Long wait times when there seemed to be lots of staff and only 2 or 3 other tables.  Staff was not attentive... They're friendly, but don't seem to have the attitude stop go out of their way to make sure the guest experience is perfect.  Pricing was nearly double other off-strip sushi restaurants.  Quality was good, but didn't seem to justify the price point.

I left this feedback for the owner too, so hopefully he/she received it."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was amazing. The service was quick and friendly.  The food was to die for. The fish was fresh, the sauces had a diverse flavor profile, and the rolls were well executed. The braised pork belly was so good. It melted in my mouth and had a delicious broth with it. Even the ginger and wasabi were impeccable. The ginger was not from a jar, it was freshly grated and the wasabi was not from a tube. It was so much more strong and flavorful than the average wasabi. The homemade green tea cheesecake was the perfect ending to our meal. The cheesecake was light and fluffy and the powdered ceremonial green tea used had a robust flavor. 
I have eaten sushi all up the California coast, and in Florida. I was very skeptical about sushi in Henderson NV but I am so glad that I did not let my skepticism get the best of me. This was by far the best sushi we have ever eaten. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves authentic, delicious sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls were small about the size of a quarter and only six pieces for the price of $7 a roll. I had the shrimp tempura roll which was actually good and the Japanese lasagna roll that one sucked. It was mushy and felt like someone just threw it in the microwave I didn't want to eat it but at $7.95 I forced myself. Will I go back again? More than likely not. The waitress was good just food quality sucked. My family had the chicken bento box that was a lot of food but they both didn't like it either. They mentioned it had no flavor and the meat was very charred.  Idk maybe my expectations were different for living in Los Angeles and having sushi out there."}
{"text":"Extremely great quality, very fresh.  They had live lobster and uni. I was very pleased with everything on the menu.  Would definitly go there again.  Small hidden gem and open late."}
{"text":"Started the best and still the best! REAL Japanese food, REAL Japanese chef for the discerning connoisseur."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has 4 stars, fake reviews! So of course you expect to get miso and edamame complimentary but not here, everything is ordered separately. It was not busy at all and some how managed to bring our food out all at different times. We had a newbie server, she managed to spill a soda off her tray all over my arm. Broken glass and drink was left on the floor until we left, after I asked them to clean it up multiple times. Bad service. Food was just ok, they don't even offer all you can eat! They tried to give me a $20 gift card for next time, I put it toward my tab, never coming back!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOW!!!! avid sushi fans who know sushi, this is the place to be..blue fin o toro oh my o..  love this place every thing is fresh and the presentation is awesome thank you chef Hiro and chef Isao and staff !!!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for some fresh sushi and simple traditional Japanese preparation techniques, this the restaurant for you. From the toro, to the seared abalone with liver soy sauce, the menu is overwhelming for the observant eye. The price is on par with the quality of the food. Is recommend it to anyone wanting a traditional Japanese sushi experience."}
{"text":"To be fair, the food is good and fresh and the service is good. However, this is by the far the most expensive Sushi restaurant that I've ever eaten at in Las Vegas. Based on my check-ins and reviews, my family from San Diego and I frequent other Sushi places that are more la-di-da than this place and not once did we complain about prices but this place is very unrealistic about their prices. We ordered some dishes but decided to not spend anymore of our money here and left while still hungry. 
We ended up going to the competition up the street from them with better selections and worth every dollar for it. 

I don't recommend this place to locals and visitors alike. It's like highway robbery to me."}
{"text":"The food here was really good and they had excellent service. A little pricey but it was worth it. The sushi was good and their sticky rice was perfect. My girlfriend used to live in Japan and she said this place was pretty authentic. They greet you like a Japanese restaurant overseas would and they also give you a proper goodbye. I would definitely recommend this place to someone who wants good Japanese food."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place at all. Their sushi menu is really limited and the sushi is really generic. The service is just ok. It wasn't awful, but I would go back. There's too many other sushi places in town that offer better food and a better experience. I don't know how it got 4 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here for two years and they treat us like family.  It's run by a husband and wife and they are the sweetest couple. The fish is always fresh. I ate here throughout my pregnancy with no problems of course it was okayed by my doc."}
{"text":"This place has fake reviews!  Bad service and bad food! If I could I would give no star!"}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi.  The chirashi bowl is full of amazingly fresh fish, some things I usually don't eat, I gobbled it all down! The only thing I had to pick out was the ginger, just not a ginger lover.  Fresh wasabi is available and worth ordering. We also had udon noodles with tempura, the broth was very flavorful and tempura light and crispy. 
Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service even worse food! I will never eat here again! Only eat here if you want to be ignored and wait forever for food and a check to pay for gross food!! Hurt my stomach so bad! And everyone at my table too! We waited over 30mins for a check to pay for food that made me sick!!"}
{"text":"Living smack dab in the middle of \"Hender-tucky\" finding an affordable, authentic, and most importantly delicious Japanese sushi experience can be somewhat of a trying task, that is, until I discovered this hidden gem.  Although making its home in the most unglamorous setting, a 1950's esque diner fit with aluminum building and giant neon sign, \"Tokyo Boys\" is the definition of do not judge a book by its cover. Walking in I was not expected much more than a Asianized Denny's, but I was surprised to find an extremely modern and \"cool\" looking establishment fit with dim lights, a glimmering granite sushi bar, and a much roomier booth area than one would expect from the exterior. Greeted by the main chef, Hiro, that makes you feel as if you have been coming to the restaurant for years, and a friendly wait staff, I knew before even tasting the food that I was going to be a regular. Now on to the cuisine, from hot crispy karage to the fresh sashimi; \"Tokyo Boys\" excels in a wide variety of categories. Although most of the menu can be a little pricey for the \"average\" lunch stop after work, one of the best deals on the menu is the lunch or dinner combination. Coughing up a measly $14 I was able to choose 3 different entrees plus a small salad, white rice, and a cup of miso soup. Although I have tried all six different choices since coming for the first time, my personal favorite has been the teriyaki salmon, tempura, and fried pork cutlet combo. On top of the various appetizers such as grilled squid, udon, karage, and other \"cooked\" cuisine the sushi and rolls are, as expected, to die for. Dishing out $14 for nigiri of the quality that is served at \"Tokyo Boys\" is almost stealing and the $12 \"Roppongi\" roll chalk full of spicy tuna, shrimp, and a combination of delicious sauces, is one of the best rolls I've ever had at any restaurant. For the quality of food, the affordable price, and the welcoming staff, \"Tokyo Boys\" is a must try for any sushi lover in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"If you want really good japanese food at a reasonable price in a comfortable and friendly place , please go to Tokyo Boy's in Henderson on Stephanie.

The owner , Hiro , is a master Chef and prepares the best Japanese food I have eaten. Even better than what I had while living on SF peninsula .

Try some standards like His excellent from scratch miso soup, bento box, tempura and grilled herring. Then delve into the dining experience by asking Hiro to fix you something special as an adventure.

Complementing the food is a nice selection of sake, teas and beers.

Everything was top quality ,expertly served in a clean, comfortable and friendly environment at a surprisingly reasonable price.

Try some of Junko's excellent desserts with a cup of their really good coffee to top off your dinner.

5 stars in my book!

I am bringing friends and family here to share the dining experience.

{"text":"Definitely have had better sushi. I guess for the area, it's pretty good. The quality of the fish was ok, and roll that we got was ok too. Our friends got the premium chirashi bowl, which they enjoyed."}
{"text":"The best Japanese restaurant in Henderson and trust me, I know Japanese food really well. This is not your typical all you can eat crap or sushi place, none of that. This is real Japanese the way it should be, when you take your time eating and enjoying the pleasure of eating Japanese food and not stuffing your face with all you can eat low class Sushi where you try to eat as much as you can to get your money's worth. Everything you order here is fresh, simple and delicious, you can taste the difference, the freshness and the quality of the varieties of dishes they offer. I also like the staff a lot. You definitely will get your money's worth for every bite and you will never go back to eating crappy sushi again after you try this place because then, you will know what Japanese food should really taste like."}
{"text":"It was average sushi but over priced. I probably wouldn't go back here because there are a few places in the area that are better. I did enjoy their garlic tuna shashimi, I also go the Yum Yum roll and it was good. The food tasted like anywhere else but just priced more."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the food here. Staff is very nice and helpful. We have tried a variety of things off the menu, and haven't found anything we didn't like."}
{"text":"Four years on and they are as delicious as ever. Their hot foods continue to be delicious and their sushi quality is still splendid. And even better, occasionally they will feature specials such as live uni or Wagyu Japanese A5 beef. 

As ever, Tokyo Boys is well worth a visit and will not disappoint.

And to the one aspect I originally wasn't satisfied with four years ago, no pictures in their menu, they've taken care of that with gusto. Their menu now is quite customer friendly. :)"}
{"text":"My go-to spot for hangover food. It's near my work and when you have a hangover, you'll need miso soup.

I've been here a couple times but I've hesitated doing a review. I thought, it's too good to be true. But I'm giving in. THIS PLACE IS AMAZEBALLS , left and right amazeballs! (get it? GET IT!?).

I always get the lunch combo, either the 2 item or 3 item. Either or, still delish. BUT here's the trick to get your money's worth. Order a lunch bento - 2 item. Get the sashimi and anything deep fried (usually chicken katsu for me). Totes delish! The sashimi is tuna and salmon. VERY, VERY, FRESH!

Service is good. Kinda sad that the employees already know me cause I always come in with my work polo with my name tag on. Oh well, more free water for me.

Rarely gets busy. I notice that this place gets a lot of Japanese customers. You gotta go where the Japanese goes right?"}
{"text":"We just finished celebrating a very special birthday dinner. Our family has dined here many times and the quality of fresh fish is beyond compare. The special Lobster Boat tonight was Amazing! 

Chef Hiro always serves the best! His staff is most attentive and friendly.
It was a most enjoyable evening! 
When you need your fix of fresh fish and Japanese cuisine, only go to Tokyo Boys!

THANKS"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and choices of saki.  Very fun decor and clean.  The service was excelent and the food came out quick.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've always passed this place thinking it wasn't worth trying but I checked out Yelp and my babe and I stopped by since we were craving sushi but it was 12am. This place is open till 2 am and I'm glad we came cause we LOVED it. Their sashimi is so good and taste fresh. They had happy hour specials such as assorted sashimi 5 pieces was just $10 and sake for $5. They also have other specials not on the menu that were just as tasty. Saba was awesome and perfectly cooked. This is our new neighborhood sushi spot. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"It was dual birthday celebration night since my brother and I born week apart. We have family tradition go out celebrate both our birthday. Our birthday family night decided too check out new sushi spot in Henderson on that my brother use too work with the sushi chef Hiro. Always excited too try new restaurants and Tokyo Boys no exception too the rule!

Once got there realize that the location has changed restaurants so many times hard too keep track current one. It in Henderson part of town no venture too very often. I do remember last time some kind of diner. The outside of the building is the same so first glance thinking really sushi restaurant. LIke reading book never judge book by its cover my friends. The first step inside they done great job of changing the decor with little accents too give it more of japanese restaurant. The lantern style lighting all over the restaurant. Soon you walk in instead of your typical dinner sit down counter literally long long row for sushi bar. It very much spacious all around. Ample choices comes too booths, tables, or sushi bar. Inside never think looking from outside be eating japanese restaurant.

It a la carte. Never been fan of comes too sushi but mixing things up is spice of life. We ordered bunch of different things. The Tori karage was delicious. I enjoy the nice crispy skin on the outside and nice moist on the inside. The kakuni or braised pork belly that was keeper! It little bowl filled with goodies. Nice chunks of braised pork that so moist falls apart in your mouth. The sauce more like broth that cooked in along with couple hard boiled eggs. It penetrates literally both the pork and the eggs or perfection. Awesome. Tuna poke salad was ok. One of the things not really that high on had better poke. The spicy yellowtail hand roll. Winnah! Odd but looking at the sushi menu never really had hand roll section. I ask but more then happy too make it.. We had yellowtail with ponzu sauce that was delicious. Few rolls several more dishes. Quality of the fish. I thought it was pretty darn good. The quality was there in all the dishes we had from the sashimi, the sushi rolls, and even had black cod! The presentations for small place outside of strip was really elegant. Most part even though not fan of a la carte the prices are not too bad. You can tell Hiro sushi chef puts his heart and soul into all of his dishes. Hiro easy too talk stories too makes sitting at sushi bar more fun experience. All had great experience here at Tokyo Boys. If in the area would come back again."}
{"text":"I'm half Japanese and grew up in Japan, my wife is full-Japanese. We lived in Vegas for over 20 years. My wife is very picky about Japanese restaurants in the U.S. and  doesn't like most Japanese restaurants in Vegas so sometimes we drive all the way down to Torrance or Costa Mesa for a good Japanese dinner. She recently found this place and LOVES their Sushi ! The owner is the chef and he chooses his fish very carefully. We go there for lunch and haven't been there for dinner yet.  I'm not much of seafood fan so I order their sushi/beef combo bento which is very good, good portions for the price (around $12.00) ."}
{"text":"If you love sushi, you need to try Tokyo Boys. Great selection of fresh fish and they always have seasonal special selections from around the world. Wonderful staff that provide fast friendly service. The old diner makes for a great place to visit with family and friends to enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"Ever eat somewhere and the food is so delicious you believe it's your moral obligation to write a Yelp review? Go to Tokyo Boys and you'll feel it. Absolutely wonderful dining experience! Fantastic service. We were ordering more and more food so we kept our server running. We had grilled  Amber Jack collars that melted in your mouth like butter. The Tiger roll, Japanese lasagna roll, soft shell crab salad, tuna roll, albacore...everything utterly delicious. For desert we tried the black sesame panna cotta, it was delightful! Creamy and almost nutty flavor with a slight mocha aftertaste. Wonderful! We will be going back for more!"}
{"text":"As a former restaurant owner I highly recommend this place. You might be hesitant to walk in when you see a facade that looks more like a burger/diner joint but once you experience the food you won't regret. You can definitely taste the Japanese tradition on their food. Very fresh fishes and great quality ingredients all prepared by their experienced Japanese staff. You will notice that they give a lot of attention to details such as the right temperature of the fish, the preparation of the sushi rice, etc... Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Terrific. We were craving great, traditional Japanese food, and really enjoyed our meal here. Tempura udon, toro nigiri, chicken karaage, tamago...all great."}
{"text":"Legit, authentic sushi.  We heard about this place when speaking to a guy who works for the James Beard Foundation and it seriously doesn't disappoint.  The service is friendly and efficient and the sushi is amazing.  I always order a tuna roll and the Tokyo Boys roll (sans mayo sauce) and my boyfriend usually orders the Chirashi.  We've had the nigiri and some of the appetizers, as well as the miso soup.  Everything is delicious and made perfectly.  

The tuna is always flawless and practically melts in your mouth.  The Tokyo Boys roll has tempura shrimp, avocado, eel (and eel sauce), crabstick, and cucumber.  I personally love the way the warmness from the shrimp feels in my mouth in contrast to the coldness of the fish/crab/avo/cukes.  

Last year they hosted a New Year's party and I'm really hoping it happens again because I'd love to go.  Yelp says they're closed Sundays, but they're not!  Also they have some pretty late hours, so you can almost go at any time- service is always great!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Authentic Japanese Sushi Chefs.  We walk in to Bob Dylan overhead soon followed by the Violent femmes food and service are all perfect!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Saturday night after Cactus Gardens and was so happy to see that it is run by real Japanese staff (there is nothing worse than walking into a Japanese restaurant full of non-Japanese chef and servers)!

The fish was fresh and the miso soup was just perfect!  I had the salmon and ikura don, which I hadn't had since the real stuff in Hokkaido, Japan years back...oh boy, oh boy!  Though it had too much sauce for my taste, it was awesome!

I wish they were closer to my place ;("}
{"text":"\"You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.\" - Maya Angelou

4.5 Stars, as I was blown away by the Omakase at Tokyo Boys. We walked in hungry, but left full and very satisfied. Eating out is so much about value to price. You can pay more for better omakase in town, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a place that offers as many great cuts of premium fish for $85. Enjoying omakase is also about the experience, and Chef Hiro delivers there too.

When Chef called to confirm the reservation, he asked if we wanted only sushi or a combination of sushi and other small dishes. I told him that we wouldn't mind a lot of sushi, but we're open to whatever he recommends, and whatever thinks is best for us to indulge in. As such, we had a sushi heavy dinner, with a few well-prepared and incredibly tasty small plates. On the sushi side of things, there were four nigiri courses that were all grouped together and made a lot of sense...such as Tuna four ways, and a course with yellowtail, Japanese snapper, and amber jack. As far as the small plates go, Chef presented an Otoro tartare that was absolutely amazing.

Chef Hiro certainly lets his products speak for themselves. He tends to utilize a handful of complimentary ingredients that delivers beautiful flavors time after time...this simple method truly lets the premium ingredients shine, but I was also impressed at the level of Innovation produced from just bringing together four to six ingredients. This really stood out to me in an abalone dish, an aoyagi clam dish, as well as in the Otoro tartare.

I wouldn't hesitate to come back. While Tokyo Boys lacks of the refinement of other Omakase Dinners in town, they make up for it in the amount of beautiful food presented. In fact, I'd recommend them for traditional sushi palettes to enjoy. Chef Hiro made us feel incredibly welcome, and I am grateful for the opportunity to sit at his counter."}
{"text":"Very nice sushi joint! Loved that it was open till 1 am on a weeknight. Large variety of Japanese food including a ton of rolls/sushi. Pleasant staff. Clean. This will be on my regular rotation of sushi joints."}
{"text":"I ordered the katsu don and California roll. My order came out to about $20 (with tax) and my miso soup was missing. The online menu states the katsu is $10.95 (with miso soup included) and CA roll is $6.00, so there's no way the total was correct. I called the owner and asked why my subtotal was more than $16.95 and she said the katsu price went up and they do not have soup to-go. No apology or anything. Overall, bad customer experience and food was ok. With all the other competitively priced Japanese restaurants available with better service, I think I'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase. I don't know how this place has almost 5 stars but um.... Yeah so, obviously it isn't AYCE. You have to order everything separate. So the nigiri doesn't come in pairs as it does at most places. Which I thought okay cool whatever. But for it being 2-4 a piece, I figured it was caught fresh and transported here straight from the sea. I ordered salmon, yellowtail, tuna, white tuna, uni, jumbo sweet shrimp, and a whole bunch of other things.

It was delivered to me on a beautiful setting. I'll give it that. Too bad it didn't taste as good as it looked. Everything except the jumbo sweet shrimp came out at room temperature or warmer which was really disgusting. I could barely eat it. It definitely didn't taste fresh. It tasted like it was literally left out for a day. For the price I'm paying, shit, I should've just went to Nobu.

I'm a very big uni connoisseur and everywhere I go, it's a hit or miss, and this one was a miss for sure. It was very bitter and the consistency was bleh.

So if it wasn't for the very very nice waitress, I forget her name but she was young and freshly graduated high school, and the nice busser, this place would've got 1 star. But service was great. Food, not so much."}
{"text":"Sushi was great. Loved the cucumber salad. All around a really good sushi place. Def going back sometime."}
{"text":"As a busy student, I don't have much time to cook or sit in restaurants. I try to eat healthy but it is not easy. I tried Tokyo Boys for the first time on Wednesday. I called in my order for pick up so that I wouldn't have to wait, they told me that it would take 20min. I ordered a Salmon Ikura Don. I was told that it usually comes with soup but they are unable to pack it to go so they offered me salad as a substitute. I was greeted promptly and my order was ready when I arrived.  It tasted so good and fresh! I will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great atmosphere, quick service. Excellent sushi with fresh ingredients. The only negative is slightly inflated prices."}
{"text":"11.30.13.

Who would have thought, an authentic Japanese restaurant, smack-dab in the middle of nowhere (as it seemed) somewhere in Vegas. I know walking in here I was a bit skeptical...

Our family came here on a whim, since it was the closest & highly recommended via Yelp. But upon arrival, the 50's diner exterior (red/silver trim, white tile) took me by surprise & def left me wondering if this place was for real/legit.

Since we were hungry, we decided to just stick with it & give it a try...and good thing we did! We all loved our meals & this place does live up to the standards of good, Japanese cuisine in my book. It is run by Japanese owners who appeared to be able to speak Japanese as well!

When we entered, the restaurant was empty except for another couple sitting in another booth. These owners kept the 50's feel of the diner, but changed the color palette to a dark, rich colors (think eggplant). There are both (50's style) booths & a sushi bar.

I believe we all ordered teishoku-type meals with either two or three choices (~$15). I went with the teriyaki salmon & assorted tempura (2 shrimp, onion, eggplant, sweet potato, jalepeno, & a mushroom); this also came with miso soup, rice & salad with an ethnic dressing (that I wasn't really a fan of...sort of a grainy, green sour/sweet dressing). Prior to our meals we also ordered a roll as an appetizer; the Yum Yum roll (~$8?), a mixture of crab, lobster & scallops with tobiko...I think it was also spicy...

Overall, we were very happy with the quality & taste of our meals! The other Yelpers were right in lauding this restaurant for it's tempura! It really was light, fluffy, & not oily or heavy at all!! Service here was also great. Although it was not crowded we were still catered to as things got slightly busier & I noticed that even though the restaurant was technically supposed to close 30 minutes after we arrived, we were not rushed or pushed out. They also continued to take customers during this time!

I think we will def come back to this place the next time we're in Vegas! Yum yum!

{"text":"If you recognize quality this is the place for you.  Hands down the best Japanese food in town and the nicest owners."}
{"text":"This has been our Friday nite hangout since they opened in 2013. All the food is super fresh and delicious. Saba, kohada, oysters & uni are must tries. Hiro, the owner, has worked on and off the strip and really knows his stuff. 

Note that this is not an all you can eat joint, so prices are higher than those places, but so is the quality. If you've ever eaten sushi on the strip you will note this place has the same quality without the high strip prices. 

Other must tries: Beni Toro salad, sake kama (salmon collar), sashimi plate, orange clam...Maybe it would be easier to mention what is not good....oh, that would be nothing that we have tried (and we've tried a lot)"}
{"text":"Had a tasty meal here last week.

Chef was great and food was fresh. Definitely a gem in the sea of chains that makes up Henderson. If you find yourself near the Galleria Mall in Henderson definitely go check this owner operated Chef driven pace out.

My Rating Scale
5 Stars - Would go back weekly
4 stars - Would go back monthly
3 stars - Only going back if friends wanted to go
2 stars - Will not go back at all
1 star - Will probably go out of business soon"}
{"text":"I don't understand the almost 5 star rating. The menu is small and limited. It smelled kind of fishy walking in which is what you're NOT supposed to smell despite it being a sushi joint. My boyfriend had chirashi and I a tiger roll. My roll came out several minutes before his so i stared at my food for awhile waiting so we could eat together. Neither was spectacular nor something we'll be back for - basically it got the job done for a dinner while we were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here after reading all the great reviews. The food was good but not much to choose from very small basic menu and if you want anything spicy it was an extra charge. Kinda seemed expensive for sushi."}
{"text":"Needed a late night sushi spot to meet some friends on a whim on a Tuesday night and was pleasantly surprised to see that Tokyo Boys was open until really late!

I wasn't too hungry so I settled for a Tiger Roll while my friends ordered a variety of other rolls, chicken teriyaki bento box, and a sashimi rice bowl. We basically shared everything so I was able to taste a little of each.

The bento box presentation was great. The salad dressing was delicious and chicken well cooked and not overdone. I wasn't too impressed with the tiger roll, the shrimp tempura inside of it was cold and a bit soggy. A little disappointing, but still good. 

However, the sushi was not cheap and the nigiri was priced by each piece rather than an order of 2 pieces which I'm more used to. The fish was very fresh and the service was good though, so I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good quality late night eats."}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place during the daytime for years.  They're only open from 5pm to 1am Tuesday through Sunday; closed on Mondays. I finally decided to try it for dinner.  It was worth the wait!  The place is clean and the service was good.  They also speak Japanese which was nice.  I ordered too much food, but did finish all of it.  As I write this I'm still stuffed.  I highly recommend Tokyo Boys!"}
{"text":"The best place in town!!! Love you Hiro 
You you want fresh hands down this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants in Las Vegas and have had my share of hits and misses when it comes to delicious, fresh, and memorable sushi. I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner after one of his friends recommended this place for great sushi.

Don't let the outside appearance and interior design fool you. At first, we were very skeptical about the sushi quality. It looked as though the place was built around an old burger joint and diner. But we gave the place a shot and ordered the $100 sashimi boat. The wait was a little long, but you can't rush sushi. When the food arrived at the table, we were very pleased. The fish was very fresh and our waitress was very knowledgeable about each and every single piece of fish that was on our boat and recommended various ways to fully enjoy the taste of the fish. My boyfriend and I enjoyed every piece on there.

Based on the reviews that gave lower ratings, it is safe to say that this place is meant for sushi and fish alone. If you're looking for a place to eat steak and large meals with sushi as an appetizer, you've come to the wrong place. This is a great place for sushi lovers who don't mind paying a little more for great quality fish and great service."}
{"text":"The food is okay, there wasn't much fillings in their lumpia and their cheese Ragoon."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and will definitely be coming back.   The sushi is amazing, we shared different types of rolls and some of the specialty rolls as well and they were all outstanding.  The presentation is and all the rolls were delicious.  We had excellent service and really enjoyed the whole experience.  Don't let the 50's diner loom from the outside throw  you some of the best Japanese food inside."}
{"text":"The best Sushi place I've ever been to! The staff is super nice and Hiro is an amazing chef and a really nice guy! Their food is high quality and they are so warm and friendly that I have become a regular there. I love the fact that I can get a late night craving and grab a bite there because it is open til 2am...
I can't say enough good things about this place, we need to spread the word! (just please don't take my seat at the counter)"}
{"text":"When I saw the menu for Tokyo Boys I wasn't sure what to expect. I've never encountered a Japanese diner but I'm glad I did. I must say I was impressed by the quality of food and service. I wish I could remember the name of their popular roll but it was recommended by the waitress and it was indeed delicious. It had spicy tuna and shrimp. I also tried the bento box which came with a side of miso soup and a small seaweed salad. You have two options for the bento box. I chose chicken katsu and Gyoza (potstickers). It was absolutely delicious, I highly recommend! My only criticism would be it is on the pricey side. $15 for 8 pieces of sushi but it was definitely worth it. Also they are open til 1:30 AM so definitely a plus if you're out late and craving sushi."}
{"text":"Poor experience, tuna roll is a rip off for 6.50. Even if you request for canceling the order they wont accommodate. Thanks for an awful birthday experience."}
{"text":"This place is really a gem. Tried sashimi and sushi. Both are perfect. Highly recommend! Also ordered tempura ice cream and Mochi ice cream. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I had driven by this place for almost a year before I actually tried it. I was initially drawn to it because of the whole neon diner theme it has going on - which I love! But when I finally went in and tried it I was blown away by how good it was, and was also slapping myself for not trying it sooner.

I've had sushi from many places here in Las Vegas and this place is the best in my opinion. The fish is always fresh and delicious, the staff is always very kind, and the chef is just awesome in general - sometimes he will throw in a few extra pieces of sushi and it's always an awesome surprise when he does. I order sushi to go at least once - sometimes twice a week from here and whenever family visits my husband and I will take them here and they always love it. 

My favorite things to order are the toro, spicy tuna rolls, salmon, and their teriyaki chicken is to die for with the tempura fried veggie strings it's served on. All in all this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas and I will keep on recommending it to family and friends. If you're in Las Vegas, and in search of delicious, quality sushi then please do yourself a favor and eat at Tokyo Boys!!"}
{"text":"Definately had better quality sushi many other places. The fish was not super fresh or tasty. I figured I would give this place a try because it was convenient and had pretty good reviews. I would not go back a second time.  Pricey for the quality"}
{"text":"My husband and I always pass by the restaurant when heading to do our weekend shopping. Always curious about how good the food is inside because it looked like a shiny diner on the outside. With that being said...we decided to last Friday have a date night at Tokyo Boys. It was an amazing food experience! The quality of the food is comparable to the high end Japanese restaurants on the strip. Presentation of each dish done so beautifully. Chef Hiro takes your palate to another level. Tokyo Boys is now our favorite off the strip Japanese restaurant to go to. We're so lucky that it's in Green Valley!"}
{"text":"I regret eating here because I just got done working out. The portion are scarce and it takes time for the food to come. Food taste good but I regret stopping here when I'm really hungry. It's definitely pricy here $24 for small salmon skin salad, 2 ordinary (small) rolls. Ambience, mmnn what ambience? practically it's non-existent. Our waitress is so attentive and kind. I left so unhappy and went to Sushi Cafe to really eat it's in the same area."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"Wooooow...!!!!\" What an amazing surprise and with good quality Sushi that is super close to us in Henderson! We first tried it out last two weeks ago and have been back 6 times since then! 

I have had the grilled Ribeye, Hamachi Kama, gyoza, miso soup, Tekka -Don, Tokyo Boys Roll, Shrimp Tempura Lover Roll and the Chef's special Sushi bowl. All were amazing and more than on-point than most of the sushi restaurants out there. Not expensive and just delicious! Open till 12:30AM, which is also amazing! 

The service is extremely friendly and warm. They have TVs, a decent selection of sake and beer. 

This is easily our new \"goto\" spot."}
{"text":"This is the first off the strip place that has TORO on the menu and on the specials board. Totally legit!!!"}

{"text":"We were actually here as group of four on Valentine's Day this year. We just figured to skip the madness of the crowds and so sushi. 
After reading reviews I was prepared for the way the building looked, but didn't realize the inside was never remodeled?? They played Sinatra music. Atmosphere confusing.
The sushi was alright, nothing bad to say. A bit overpriced.
Would we go back? Probably not. The atmosphere just didn't justify the cost."}
{"text":"Applause to chef Hiro-San! He brings an amazing background of knowledge as he demonstrates his passion for Japanese cuisine with experience at Nobu, Blue Ribbon and others, yet I am a huge fan of Tokyo Boys.

Thanks to the Yelp Reviews, especially our trusted friend Phillip T. for putting this one on our radar. My love and I bookmarked this spot on the other side of town a while back and then, when our tastebuds for calling for the oceans, we called for a reservation and to accompany?...none other than Phiilip and his lovely wife Ayumi...success!!!

My love, David V., talked to chef Hiro prior to about the detailes for our reservation...we got such amazing dishes, plate after plate. All four of us were awed by the quality as compared to the price. Chef Hiro has only one boundary between the price and quality...to the top.

I would comeback in a heart beat to Tokyo Boys, especially for simple Chirachi after seeing Steffany V's review.

Thank you to all the Yelpers for highlighting this one, especially to Phillip T. and David V.. And a huge thanks to Chef Hiro and also Mrs. Hiro, who presented us the amazing dessert...Domo Arigato!

{"text":"* This is review is mainly on entree items, not sushi. 

Tried this place for the first time yesterday and I'm soo mad that I didn't get to take any pictures cause my phone died :( 

Soo if you know this area, you know that this place went through several owners like Bernard's Bistro and thus we get a shiny silver diner Japanese place Lol. I'm happy that the chef and sushi chef were both Japanese so that's a plus. We decided to share a whole bunch of items: braised pork belly (kakuni), Japanese fried chicken (karaage), seaweed salad, eel bowl (unagi don), a dragon roll and tempura ice cream.

Kakuni: wasn't what I was expecting but it was delicious. Super tender, came served in a bowl with rich broth and eggs.

Chicken Karaage: always a favorite of mine, super light and salty in a good way. Came with about 6-7 pieces.

Seaweed Salad: Soo good. I hate when a place makes it super dry but here they make it perfectly with the right balance of sesame oil, vinegar, sugar and soy sauce.

Unagi Don: a little on the pricey side compared to everything else at $18 but it is soo worth it. I have not seen such great quality eel probably since I left Okinawa. Super tender, probably about 6-7 pieces with each piece being two fingers in width. Yummy! Served with too much rice but honestly I haven't had an unagi don anywhere with a \"normal\" amout of rice lol

Dragon Roll: a pet peeve of mine was that it wasn't rolled tight enough, some pieces fell apart a little. They used a good amount of ingredients and not a ridiculous amount of rice so that's good. The eel on top was the same quality we got on the unagi don yumm. However I feel the sushi rice was made a little too sweet for my taste.

Tempura ice cream: we had the vanilla even though they offer a green tea version. The perfect ending, cold and warm and the tempura actually tasted like yellow cake Lol so good. 

Oh and they offer Orion beer! & at $8 for a liter! If you've never tried, it's an Okinawan light beer, kind of like a mix between Bodington's & Chang's beer.

The atmosphere is very casual, very...unjapanese lol looked like a diner still with bits of Asian flair but it was very clean and the food was good so no problem! I just wouldn't make coming here a first-date type of option.

Overall: 4/5 for regular food & 3/5 for sushi
I'll probably come back here specifically for entrees instead of sushi and for bento boxes during lunch time."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been in 6-7 times now and it has become our favorite place to go out in Henderson.  We actually haven't gone to any other restaurants since we started coming here.  My first impression from the outside was thinking old 50's diner.  I'll admit I was hesitant.  But my wife liked the classy Tokyo Boys logo so we gave it a shot and I'm glad we did.  I think that now when I see a 50's diner I will think of Tokyo Boys.  Now I like the stainless steel look.  

We enjoy sitting at the sushi bar and chatting with Hiro, his wife Junko and the other friendly patrons.  Hiro is the owner/chef, which is comforting because he cares about his business and the food he serves.  Sometimes we go for lunch but last night we did a late dinner and stayed until about 01:15 am.  Nice to have a classy late night spot close to home.

I am a fisherman and I always save the collars and belly of my catch.  Those are the best pieces to smoke or broil because they have all the fat and flavor.  I was pleased to see salmon belly and collar on the menu.  The collar is cooked just the way I like it.  The salmon is from Scotland.  Sorry I don't know the Japanese names that well.  I get a seaweed salad to start each meal.  I also like the smelt and flying fish roe with a quail egg over the top!  I tried Uni here for the first time too and it had a pleasant almost sweet after taste.  Hard to describe but it was pretty good.  Can't go wrong with the Chefs Choice option at the bottom of the sushi menu either.

If I sound too overly positive about Tokyo Boys it's because I really don't have any negative comments to add.  If I did I would post them on here.  Price is good, food is fresh and is matched with the owner/chef experience.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had. Such a treat. Don't let the exterior of the establishment fool you, this place has quality ingredients and Hiro has a passion for producing unique offerings. Had the sushi combo and was delighted to see that the spicy tuna roll had the same tuna as specialty rolls and not ground up tuna parts like the vast majority of other sushi restaurants. Had a little extra room and was treated to a Waygu nigiri and Japanese snapper nigiri. The contrast of savory and then bright acidity between the two pieces was impeccable. If you're looking for well priced sushi that doesn't cut corners look no further than Tokyo boys."}
{"text":"Ok, finally made it back to Tokyo Boys...and after 16 years confronted my old nemesis, Uni, and .....damn it's my new favorite bite! Hiros' wisdom is well received, and greatly appreciated. I guess I said it all in my first review, don't sleep on this place, make the drive out to Henderson and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had the Premium Sashimi Plate, $50 for 24pcs. Total legit! Will definitely be back real soon!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Henderson and must visit. I love here and will come again."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese sushi/sashimi restaurant, good food, excellent service, extensive sake menu. Perfect location."}
{"text":"Can't believe I've never reviewed my favorite sushi spot in the city!   If you're looking to gorge on AYCE, this is not your spot.  If you're looking to have great, fresh fish prepared by a master, at reasonable prices, this is your spot.

Hiro and his staff ensure that you will have a fantastic sushi experience.  They don't cut corners...they just prepare beautiful omakase and chirashi.  Beautifully crafted food which would cost double on the strip.  

It's not your typical looking spot...it's located in an old diner-type restaurant, but don't be fooled by the exterior.  The food is amazing.

Next time you're in Henderson, and craving sushi, stop in and have some.  Your tummy and your wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is amazing! I just discovered it after visiting Las Vegas for 7 years! I wish I found it earlier. The place looks like 50's cafe on the outside (a bit confusing at first), but inside its eclectic Asian fusion decor. Food is to die for and fish is so fresh and top notch cuts.
I didn't have a chance to try a lot, just had to kill an hour by myself and wasn't hungry. Yellowtail Jalapeño sashimi plate -I will never forget this heavenly appetizer. Yummyyyyy ! Basic sashimi salad was not so basic, it was exquisite. A bite of green tea cheesecake sealed the deal ... And now I'm in love... with Tokyo Boys ! And I'm definitely coming back... Hungry!"}
{"text":"Chef Hiro is one of Henderson's and Las Vegas' Living Treasures.  There is plenty that has already been said by other reviewers so there's no need for me to repeat all of the wonderful praise that Tokyo Boys truly deserves."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas hands down!!!! I'm from Los Angeles so when it comes to sushi I'm super picky!  the quality is amazing here! Found my new sushi spot!"}
{"text":"First time here! Everything was fresh, hot and had good flavors! The Japanese Lasagna was delicious! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"another great experience! food is still fantastic and I got to try cold soba tonight. My server was friendly and on top of things. Best chirashi bowl I've had in town. 
I finally had the green tea cheesecake and it was just the right portion, not too sweet and delicious. They also get brownie points for remembering my name."}
{"text":"Just found our new favorite sushi spot! We have been here once before with friends and sat in a booth. This time we came as a couple and cosied up to the sushi bar. We felt very comfortable and welcome! The highlights of my meal were the salmon sashimi (melted in my mouth like butter) and the salmon skin roll which actually came off my salmon sashimi! I loved that my beer glass was chilled and I just felt so relaxed chatting with the chefs. My bf polished off a plate of Katsu Curry which brought back memories of my childhood (born in Japan). We will absolutely be back and recommend Tokyo Boys to all our friends."}
{"text":"Very polite service. Had Saba mackerel and a Tokyo Boy roll. Loved the mini salad that was served with the sushi. Tokyo Roll was excellent. Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"Tokyo Boys is the best sushi in Las Vegas, including the expensive premium hoity toity places on the Strip.  Everything is incredibly fresh, especially on Thursday nights, and the staff learns your name instantly.  I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  We are from Hawaii and used to fresh fish--the Chirashi was excellent!  Fresh and tasty!  The Una Don, lots of eel at a reasonable price and the sauce was awesome!  Grilled Saba done perfectly.  Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a reasonably priced Japanese restaurant with excellent food!"}
{"text":"This was a very average visit. They were obviously under staffed. Got my order wrong and didn't allow me to send it back and really rude severs. Save your money and go somewhere else. It's very average and not worth it. Also slow service and very unfriendly servers."}
{"text":"I needed a sushi fix quickly and I was so glad this place is open pretty late. Place was very nice & had a good-feel to it unlike the usual fast-paced & very crowded AYCE sushi places. There was only one customer & my party in the restaurant so the server was very attentive. I had the matcha green tea, some appetizers & a couple sushi rolls. They were all very tasty so I didn't realize right away that i have ordered one too many. Price is higher than usual ~ $$ but I think it was appropriate based on the quality of the food. This place is worth a try just expect to pay $$."}
{"text":"This is an excellent sushi place in an a former \"Rubys Diner\". Great nigiri and sashimi. I'd stick to the more traditional rolls. Kinda fun to be in a diner and be served sushi instead of burgers. Its not a fancy place, just good food. Service is nice, kind, I would not say its fast. Take your time, talk to each other."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! Love this place and their service! Mango sake, seared beef wagyu sushi, sweet shrimp, taco wasa. My kids love the Udon there too!"}
{"text":"The dinner at Tokyo Boys was delicious!! We had the mixed shrimp and vegetable tempura, edamame and miso soup as appetizers. The tempura was hot, crispy, and had a good variety of vegetables. Edamame and miso were good. 
The sushi was also delicious. The fish was fresh and the flavor was very good. They had both regular soy sauce and low sodium. 
We tried the Mango Sake and it paired really well with the salmon. I highly recommend it. They had a large variety of rice wines and other Japanese drinks.
We had to wait about 5-10 minutes for a table. They were a little slow with the service but the food was worth it. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times before for dinner and we love this place! Best beef teriyaki and chicken katsu we have ever had. Beef is medium rare, well seasoned and juicy. Chicken is soft and juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. Everything is always cooked to perfection every time. 

And we just discovered that their lunch box is even better and cheaper! For $12.95, you get three items and soup, rice and salad!

This place has become my absolute favorite Japanese restaurant in the area !"}
{"text":"The nicest staff and best Chirashi bowl I've had in my life! Fish was all fresh and uni melted in my mouth. My boyfriend had the miso cod also and it was delicious! A definite new favorite dinner stop for us!!"}
{"text":"Saw the photos on yelp, which looked fantastic, so I thought I'd give this place a shot.  

I started with some nigiri: garlic tuna, salmon, and salmon belly.  There's not many sushi places that only offer 1 piece of nigiri...it's typically 2 pieces of nigiri for the price of the 1 I got here.  All 3 pieces were delicious and fresh.  The salmon was very fresh, and the salmon belly melted in my mouth like butter.  

Got the roppongi roll, which I thought had mediocre flavor....even with the yellow sauce they had on the side and soy sauce.  It wasn't bad, but I think it just could've had more flavor.  

The service was quick, and the sushi chefs constantly check on you, which is great!  The service is fantastic.  

Looking for a different roll to WOW my taste buds."}
{"text":"Holllllyyyyy MOLLY. This restaurant is one of the BEST sushi restaurants I've ever been to. My boyfriend and I shared the $75 sashimi plate, tuna poke salad, jalapeño poppers, yellowtail w. Jalapeño and edamame. The quality of the fish was so good, it felt like the fish just melted in my mouth. the poke salad and yellowtail jalapeño were also to die for. I would recommend this place to everyone I know! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Out of the long gone \"Ginza sushi\" location comes \"Tokyo boys\" and our first dining experience is very positive! All items are very fresh and you can taste the quality in the ingredients used. The menu selection is slightly less than most sushi restaurants, but this is a quality based sushi experience so you will have well thought out sushi instead of huge list of repetition and nonsense items that someone has made up. The Chef is actually from Japan, which not only helps the overall experience, but he has lots of past experience in high end sushi dining. We'll be back for sure and hope to repeat a great genuine sushi dining experience. Good to have the location back to life again in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Fell in love from just the outside decor itself. Old school diner look doing Japanese food?! Win!

I had their poke salad but saw my companions eat the sushi. The quality was superb, the color of all the fishes you knew it was good sh*#t. They also busted out the uni which had a vibrant color.

Def will come back for more."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice so far - once for dinner and once for lunch. Good service each time - not as much variety on hot food as other places. However, their chirashi sushi (assorted fish on a bowl of rice) was superb with an incredible variety of fresh fish - while $28 may seem expensive - it's very competitive with other similar bowls that I've had price wise, but the selection and quantity of fish was better. I'm only giving it three stars because I expected a greater variety of hot food - though what I've had (chicken karrage - fried chicken, tempura, and hot soba) were good - but very little in the way of donburi (rice bowl of different contents), or curries, etc."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of their signature roll, but not the tempura.

The exterior looked like an old Denny's. LOL

I loved the Roppongi roll, it was delicious! Presentation was superb and the taste was so refined and delicate, like the roll was treated with love while the chef was making it. If I wasn't too full I would have probably ordered another one.

The tempura however broke apart as I lifted it, and continued to fall apart while I was eating it. The tempura sauce was a bit bland for me too.

But I would definitely still come back to see what else this place has to offer."}
{"text":"Perfect. Never had a better sushi experience in my life. I've been to some of the worst, and I've even been to some of the (what I thought were) the best in Las Vegas. This beats everything. The food was FRESH, and the quality was incredible. The prices are totally reasonable, especially for what you get. We enjoyed salmon nigiri, spicy tuna, and a variety of others on the menu that I don't remember... but all of the fish was fresh and tasted wonderful. 

Overall.... such a pleasant experience. I would fly down to Vegas from Oregon just for this. I recommend this place over and over and over.... GO HERE.

Note: Sushi restaurants are normally not open during the afternoons. They close around 1 or 2pm and open back up for dinner. This is normal and necessary to maximize profits as a small business.
Also, being in the high desert, Sushi isn't going to be cheap. Consider these factors before leaving reviews, and take into account the food quality, customer service, and other aspects instead of complaining about just one thing. ;)"}
{"text":"This place was a surprise! I've always passed by it and thought what a weird place to put a Japanese restaurant. The outside looks like a diner and the inside also feels like you're in a diner too, with some Asian decor. Weird lol, but don't judge a book by its cover because the food here is surprisingly good!

We ordered

-shishito peppers
-two orders of garlic tuna
-spider roll
-yellowtail fish tacos 
- matcha and black sesame panna cotta

The shishito peppers were seasoned lightly and blistered to perfection. I wanted to try the quality of fish here because that is what people raved about the most in their reviews so we got garlic tuna. For $3.50 a piece my expectations were high, and they lived up to them. The tuna had great flavor and melted in my mouth. The spider roll was okay, I didn't like the dipping sauce it came with. The yellowtail tacos were aaaamazing! You get two for $7. The ones I had here are probably the best I have had. The shell was a little sweet but it worked with everything and I think that was what I liked the most. I would come back just for these. For desert I got black sesame panna cotta because if you know me I love black sesame anything. Good consistency and flavor in the panna cotta and cute presentation. 

Next time I am planning on trying more of their nigiri even though their selection is pretty limited."}
{"text":"Nothing about this place makes any sense but in the best way possible. The restaurant is decorated like a silver 50's diner because it used to be one of those chain diners that went out of business years ago. So it's all traditional japanese food that just happens to be served in a 50's diner. We did the omakase dinner, which was pretty pricey ($120) but DEFINITELY worth it. I can see why someone would be hesitant to spend a good chunk of change on dinner at an off the strip restaurant that isn't even decorated like the average sushi place. The food makes it up for any of those concerns 1000 times over. Everything I ate was fresh and straight up delicious. 

First of all, I love that you get fresh wasabi. With our omakase, we got o-toro, chutoro, and akami. It's super fresh and melts in your mouth basically. A5 wagyu seared with garlic. Uni from 3 different areas which was really cool to have at the same time because you could taste the differences between them. Salmon belly. The scallop with salt and lemon was one of my favorites because it was so simple but done perfectly. Two different kinds of dessert.

I loved this omakase dinner because I got great quality cuts of all the things you would expect to get like toro and wagyu, but I also tried things that were new to me or done a little differently like monkfish liver and 3 different types of uni. We also got types of mackerel and silver skinned fish that aren't offered at a lot of restaurants. I was really blown away by Chef Hiro. It was funny to hear people order california rolls and spicy tuna rolls when there was all the delicious nigiri I was trying as an option! Tokyo Boys is like a hidden gem even to some of the people who already eat there."}
{"text":"We dropped by Tokyo Boys since Earl wanted Japanese food.  We were greeted right away.  Earl ordered the braised pork belly and I got the pork katsu curry.  Earl also got an order of their uni with fresh wasabi, and we shared the spider roll.

Earl got the uni to start and he did mention that it was super fresh.  We then got our entrée.  The braised pork belly was tender and full of flavor.  My pork katsu curry was A-OK.  My ultimate favorite spot for pork katsu curry is over at Tonkotsu Kiyoshi...so I automatically compared the 2.  

Halfway through our meal, the spider roll came out.  They used thin tofu wrapper vs. seaweed.  It was alright.

An A-OK from me."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last night at 11pm (I loved how they were open until 1am, that is so convenient!). The lady and the chefs working greeted me and sat my friend and I at a comfortable booth! They were very nice :)

My friend ordered a bento box(beef teriyaki) and there were like 5 little small pieces of beef which I tasted and it wasn't that great but she liked it! I ordered 4 pieces of the EBI nigiri and it tasted SO FRESH and perfect! It was really good and they cut the tail off for you. I ordered their yum yum roll as well which was really good but it didn't come with the yum sauce (I'm sure we could've asked them to put some though). I also got their Japanese lasagna and it was ok! It wasn't the best considering I've been to many places and always order this. I like the yum roll better. But the nigiris were fresh and yummy! 

It wasn't all you can eat but we were full and after ordering their creme brûlée (which is actually flan under the crisp), the bill came out to only be 50 dollars. Not bad at all! I like my regular sushi places though but if I wanted somewhere close by I would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Came here like a week ago for the 1st time. Found out about this place on Yelp, Loved it!! We walked in and were greated immediately and they were very friendly and accommodating! Hiro and Aaron helped us with whatever Sushi we wanted, even told us we could create our own rolls! Which we both did. When we asked about the Toro, Hiro didn't even try to make us buy the expensive one! Hiro is \"The owner\"  And recommended the 9$ Toro over the 12$ Toro, now that's an honest owner;-) they also have Asahi Beer on tap and it's from Japan! it's one of the only ones in Las Vegas they said that imported straight from Japan!!! Can't wait to take some friends back here!

 Thanks A Million Junko, Aaron, and Hiro!

{"text":"I just love their tokujyo chirashi bowl. I order it to go since my hubby doesn't like sushi, so no point of eating in when you order to go it doesn't come with the miso soup unless you dine in. But yes I've tried chirashi bowl elsewhere but Tokyo boys is by far my favorite quality over quantity."}
{"text":"My boy friend and I came here late one night after work! The service was absolutely amazing. But most importantly the sushi was perfect and FRESH! You can seriously taste the quality in their food! We really loved everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Sushi is the bomb. They will add on what ever you want. And willing to create whatever your heart desire."}
{"text":"The old diner is a cool place to have a sushi restaurant. The quality was very good but not excellent. We ordered the Chirashi bowl, it wasn't as much fish as we expected and the cuts of fish were very inconsistent but the taste and presentation was great!"}
{"text":"Excelent sushi, very high quality seafood, good service, not cheap but very much worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is terrible... Keep away! I honestly don't know how this place has a 4.5 stars. Very misleading!! 

I came here with high hopes and I was very disappointed! Both the food and service sucks! I ordered a miso soup and she gave it to be along with the check. I went off yelp reviewed on what to order and the fish was not fresh. The meat was flavor less. The soft shell carb was edible. 

We spent 300 dollars here and I'm still hungry..."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best sushi I have ever had. The owner is incredibly nice ...the entire experience is perfection"}
{"text":"Love this place! Open late and has Happy hour. Nice quiet spot in Henderson to chill after work w/coworkers. Service is great as well. Would give 5 stars if they started an AYCE menu."}
{"text":"Came here and got a quick lunch to go with a coworker. So the review is for the food only.

We got a lunch combo, a sashimi plate, a soup and a salad. I found all the food to be extremely mediocre. The fish quality was ok, definitely not a high quality cut. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and my order was ready and packaged well when I got there. 

Parking is very easy and the restaurant is very easy to find as it was a Big Boy convert."}
{"text":"I am a big sushi eater and love trying new places out, so a friend told me to come here. I was not impressed at all. The sushi here was nothing special and the menu didnt have very many options. I ordered the yum yum roll and my friend ordered the Japanese Lasagna. My roll was crab and yum yum sauce. It was really bland. The Japanese Lasagna was ok but also not much flavor. The service was good but I can definitely say that I wont be returning."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of giving five stars but this restaurant truly deserves it. My husband and I came here often when it was Ginza sushi and had to venture elsewhere when it closed. Now that Tokyo Boys has opened, we decided to give the restaurant a shot to see how it compared to Ginza so here goes...

I would say Tokyo Boys is overall better than Ginza and most sushi restaurants in the area. For being a \"non-Strip\" sushi restaurant, it sure does resemble what you would at a Strip location but at a reasonable price. When we arrived, it was very quiet and we were the only patrons in the restaurant. Normally, it's a little nerve-racking to see you're the only people in a restaurant but we took into consideration Tokyo Boys has only been open a few weeks and they do not have signage yet. We were immediately greeted by Junko, their Japanese server, and the sushi chef, who we later discovered is the new owner, Hiro, who is also Japanese. I have yet to visit a Japanese owned sushi restaurant in town so you know this place is going to be good. While we were waiting for some of our order, Hiro was telling us how he has worked for Blue Ribbon at Cosmopolitan and Nobu at Hard Rock Hotel and he orders his fish from the same vendors that the above restaurants do; the only difference is that he makes the price of the sushi affordable but still having quality. He preached having quality in what he serves and the sushi definitely proved it.

Here's a description of what we enjoyed:

Tekka Maki with Avocado (Tuna roll with Avocado) - AMAZING is all I can say. The tuna was beyond fresh and melted in our mouths. We could already tell from looking at the sushi it was fresh from how red it was. This could be because Hiro receives a shipment of fish every other day rather than once a week like many other restaurants in town. This roll was only $6.50! Definitely worth the quality!

Zuke Maguro - This is Tuna sashimi drizzled with a ginger type dressing then topped with fresh wasabi. It was amazing - I am obsessed with the tuna they serve here.

Japanese Eggplant - He gave this to us to try since I do not like American eggplant and would never order anything that said eggplant but this dish was really good. I was really surprised!

Spicy Tuna Roll - Hiro makes a tuna roll then drizzles the spicy sauce on top so it doesn't take away from the fresh taste of the fish. It's not mashed together like at other restaurants so you know you're actually getting tuna. So good!

Negihama Roll - The Yellowtail was soft and melted in our mouths - no other way to describe it.

Shrimp Tempura Roll - They make the shrimp tempura made to order so it's not just sitting out all day. You can taste the crunch in every bite and it wasn't drowning in eel sauce.

Miso Soup - Tokyo Boys makes their Miso soup from scratch and doesn't use the packets like other restaurants so the soup is a lot lighter and you can taste the difference. The soup isn't as salty and is actually really refreshing. There's a whole process Hiro has with making the soup he can share if you ask him about it.

Cold Sake - He gave us a sample of cold sake (shame on me for not remembering the name) but it was really good! You could barely taste any alcohol in it and went down smoothly.

With a couple duplicates in our order, for two people, we spent around $50 not including gratuity. We were satisfied in the meal where we weren't hating ourselves from eating too much but not hungry. It was the perfect amount of food for the price and quality. We will be dining at Tokyo Boys once a week from now on.

Hope everyone visits this restaurant so we can finally have a quality sushi restaurant in town at an affordable price - their slogan, \"fine Japanese dining,\" definitely holds true!"}
{"text":"This place is interesting because it looks like a diner on the outside but it houses THEE ABSOLUTE BEST Japanese food. Everything I have ever tried here is outstanding! Even the little things... Like the dressing on the house salad, the sauce for the agedashi tofu, and the sauce for the spicy salmon hand roll. The dressing was so good that I ended up buying it for my salads at home!

The miso black cod is my favorite, the salmon chazuke is the best here, and the salmon collar is really delicious! And of course the nigiri I have tried is excellent as well....I can not express enough how good the quality of this food is and for such decent prices! The quality here is way better than the more pricey places in Vegas.

On top of all of the deliciousness, is how amazing the service is. Junko helps us every time we come here (which is very often) and she is THE BEST! She is so sweet and extremely on top of things. The service from her is comparable to high-end restaurants; constantly refilling water, taking dirty dishes away, asking if we need anything else, and even remembering what we like to order! Sometimes we'll even forget what we're missing and she'll remind us :) hahaha.

You absolutely HAVE to try this place if you love Japanese food!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we were excited to try this place. Our experience did not match the 5 star reviews, which makes me think the reviews are a bit fishy! The sushi quality is good. The presentation is sadly lacking, particularly with the sky high prices. The sushi prices are at the level of the high end sushi houses on the Las vegas strip. At least with the strip location you get a grand ambiance and an experience matching the prices. The service staff was friendly but lacking knowledge of the menu or sashimi options. The Tokoyboy ambiance is lacking and dated (specifically the old bathrooms and the broken front door). They have signage scotch taped to the front door, never a good thing.  It is not fine dining, it is not authentic Japanese... not even close. If you want a good Japanese experience and fair prices try Raku or Ichiza."}
{"text":"Always come here for their chir dashi donburri. Best in town! I recommend this place to everyone who likes good quality fish."}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome.  Owner is a gentleman.  Freshness abounds. I am a 53 yr old married man. Type A. Very particular and started my career working for  Japanese firm.  I should know good Japanese food. This is it.   JJ"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem, food is great! It is in a plaza that is a little hard to see the restaurant until you are past it. We tried it and were pleasantly surprised at how amazing the good was and the staff also.  I hope more people try this place as it doesn't seem busy and we would like to keep it around!"}
{"text":"Great food japanese chefs, hard to find a good chirashi in vegas but I have the spot!!! Its funny to me how people on yelp say they are sushi lovers and experts but they only order roll beat it amateur sushi eaters..."}
{"text":"So my friend and I wanted sushi at like midnight, and we found this cute, friendly, well ambience place. The fish is fresh tasting, and everything was prompt and kept in good manner. (There is a very small drinks/few appetisers happy hour from 1:00) it was all delicious and all around a great quality --lol great day. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner at Tokyo Boys tonight. I was so impressed with the service. The waiter, Christian, was so nice and courteous. He was attentive, too! The food was delicious and the place was clean! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My favorite place , I've been coming since they opened 4 years ago . Been over 100 times . People finally caught on to this hidden Jem. It is bar far the best sushi in all of Las Vegas . Always consistent , fresh sushi ."}
{"text":"Lurking in an unsuspecting location (probably an old diner) is Tokyo Boys. A pretty excellent place overall. I had quite the unexpected, omakase experience here. Typically, you are not going to find sushi nearly this good in Nevada so it's worth checking out. Chef Hiro is great.. say hi to him for me!"}
{"text":"My happy place!!!!!! I know...  The diner look is weird but maybe it's the trend here in Henderson...  Or maybe someone had a chain of these diners and sold the company to someone else...  Who knows... But what I do know is how fresh and delicious this place is!!!! Everytime I come here,  I am never disappointed,  unless they run out of kama (either yellow tail or salmon collar). Seriously,  their kama is always very juicy and the ponzu sauce goes so well with it!! Yum yum!! I've never had a dry kama here and if u get the combo,  it comes with rice and a choice of soup or salad. Sushi/sashimi is super fresh!! I always get the salmon sashimi here and the fat to meat ratio is on point!! The Tokyo roll is also very delicious!!! Love the staff here too!! Customer service is great! Been here several times to know that it's very consistent and their sushi standards are better than most sushi places around!! Check it out!! Lots of variety here!"}
{"text":"Everything was so good. Fresh, flavorful and amazing!  Plus, it is so close to home that we don't need to go The Strip for this kind of quality sushi. The owners are warm and welcoming.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Best place to get your sushi fix in this part of town. Absolutely love their menu. The food is fresh and they're open late! My boyfriend who was a former sushi chief and lived on an Island loves Tokyo Boys. 
Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new sushi spot in Henderson with great reviews. I decided to pop in on a Saturday to see what kind of lunch specials were available (currently Yelp says this business is closed on weekends, that is not correct, they are open Saturdays but not Sundays). I was greeted by my waitress and took a seat at the bar where the sushi chef welcomed me. 

I ended up getting the sushi lunch special: 5 pieces of sushi, my choice of a spicy tuna or California roll (I went with the tuna) and a bowl of miso soup. I asked the sushi chef what sushi came with the lunch special, and he said if I had specific fish I wanted he'd try to accommodate me, so I was able to have some delicious scallop. 

My miso soup came out first, I was still warm from being out in the heat that morning so I didn't eat much of it. As other reviews have mentioned, this is made from scratch and you can really taste the difference.

I did not have a long wait for my sushi.. Sadly, I was a tad disappointed right off the bat. I had read another review explaining that Tokyo Boys does the spicy tuna roll differently than other places, with the spicy sauce on top instead of mashing the tuna and sauce together before making the roll. I am not sure if it is because it was part of the lunch special, but my spicy tuna roll was all mashed up. The taste was fine, I was just expecting to be served the same spicy tuna roll I saw in the other reviewer's photos. My nigiri was good... Not blow-your-mind amazing but good size cuts of fairly fresh fish and a good rice/fish ratio. 

Hindsight is 20/20... I probably would have been happier if I ordered rolls, which it seems like most of the people raving about this place did. I don't see myself rushing back to Tokyo Boys, but will probably give them another try eventually."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I've always passed by and wanted to check out because it's only miles away from the bahay/casa/house.  I'm glad I did! Visited with my weirdest friend ever..

Service:  I visited on weds around 6 PM, they opened at 5 PM.  We were greeted immediately by the hostess, as well as the sushi chefs upon entering.   The servers were friendly and kept checking on us throughout dinner.  Very attentive.

Food:  Weird friend and i ordered the Premium Sahsimi Plate that comes with 24 pieces all picked by the chefs.  Great sampler and they added 4 bonus pieces and the fished head to snack on.  Everything was so so fresh and very high quality.  The salmon really stood out for me.  Our other plates: Shishito peppers and the mussels with mayonnaise were all prepped well and tasty.  The green tea cheesecake for dessert was a nice surprise!  It wasn't too sweet and was very good!

Value:  The Premium Sashimi plate was $50 and ended up with more pieces as listed on the menu.  Add : Miso Soup, mussels, shishito peppers, green tea cheesecake, small bottle of sake, the bill was a little over $100.  Fair price for the quality and service received.

Ambiance:  It appears that the establishment was previously a diner and it's evident. With that you get a very casual dining environment for some high end sushi possibilities.  I like how the sushi chefs are right behind the old diner counter when you enter and they greet you upon entering.

This is a great place to get some high quality sushi in the Green Valley area.  It's a little too casual for a date night, but it's a great place to visit for good sushi and to catch up with your weirdest friend ever which is what my visit was all about.  Their extensive menu with items outside of sushi is prompting another visit soon, but that's another yelp tale..nice work Boys! From Tokyo!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal and they were fast. I usually expect to wait but these guys got everything out quickly. They knew their regular customers and were very friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely theeeeee best sushi I've ever had. Im born and raised in Hawaii and went to Japan a couple times, but I have never found better sushi. The chirashi bowl is amazinggggg and I get it every time. I always start with the salt and pepper shrimp and seaweed salad and I am never disappointed. The service is awesome and everyone is so kind here! I hope more people get the chance to experience the amazing food here! I love love love this place! I'm so happy I found this gem!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I kept passing by this place for so long without visiting. It took months upon months, as well as a long brainstorming session when my friend finally decided to go for Japanese and I searched out the nearby Japanese restaurants on Yelp.

Tokyo Boys has the body of a 50's diner, the guts of a nice casual restaurant, and the soul of a good sushi restaurant. They're only open for dinner and they're closed on Mondays. The menu has a variety of cooked and cold dishes, plus nigiri served one piece at a time, and a relatively limited selection of special rolls. Plus, they offer daily special fresh fish until they run out.

To start the meal, they serve a small complimentary cucumber salad with a sweet and sour dressing. It was a delicious way to distract my stomach while waiting. My order also came with miso soup, which was a bit lighter but definitely less salty than typical versions of the soup. It was also enjoyable.

I went with Stefany V's recommendation of the Tokujyo Chirashi ($28), or Premium Assorted Sashimi Bowl. In contrast to what you'll sometimes get in chirashi bowls, this one has good slices of fish that are closer to what I've seen in sashimi cuts than the modest nigiri portions. In portion size alone, the vinegar rice and fish make this a solid value. There's actually so much fish that it was hard to reach the rice below without shifting a lot of fish first. Anyway, by the end, I felt quite stuffed in an almost AYCE-like fashion.

The upshot is that the sashimi was quite good, whether it was a small portion (like the 1 piece of albacore) or large portion (like 3 pieces of tuna). I was not dissatisfied with any of the cuts, even the masago-covered fish. Favorites included ikura (salmon roe), amaebi (sweet shrimp, both the body and the fried head), maguro (tuna), hamachi (yellowtail), sake (salmon), hotate (scallop), and saba (mackerel, at worst my 2nd favorite ever). Other pieces included lobster, crab, unagi (eel, but without eel sauce), ebi (shrimp), albacore, tako (octopus), smoked salmon, and tamago (sweet egg, which my friend remarked is a 9/10 that's only less soft compared to what he's had in Japan). As the chef remarked, this chirashi has everything in the case.

I had to try out dessert too, so I picked the green tea cheesecake ($4.50), which the menu states is served parfait-style. It comes in a plastic cup and it's pretty fantastic. The slightly salty crust at the bottom, the smooth and flavorful yet relatively light cheese cake, and the top layer of subtle but present green tea mousse made a wonderful combination that I actually prefer to the renditions of cheesecake served at a certain Japanese pastry shop in the Southwest.

Service was a bit iffy, with the one server seemingly stretched thing among the several tables. I had to wave her down after several idle (non-eating) minutes to get my dessert, and she took a while to swipe my credit card too. I wouldn't go here if I were hurting for time.

Tokyo Boys might not shape up as the best sushi spot if you try to compare them to the value meccas found all over the Las Vegas area, or the premium restaurants serving pieces curated with painstaking care. However, it's a very good restaurant that at the very least serves raw fish with superior-to-AYCE quality, and it's located in the Henderson area. I'm sure I'll stop by again soon if I get a sushi craving."}
{"text":"I have been going regularly for 3 years and it is still awesome everytime.  I just had the spicy beef udon from the specials menu which was fantastic.  The udon soup was topped with tender chunks of beef, sort of like stew meat, but soft like butter and very flavorful.  Everything is always great here."}
{"text":"Finally made it back here--it's a bit out of my usual area since I'm no longer in school.  It's a bit more expensive than my usual restaurants, but one of the nice things is that they give you your money's worth. Everything I've had there has been no only been good, it's been consistently good. No hits-or-misses, no \"this was better last time\".  It's the kind of place where I can order uni with complete confidence that it will be fresh and delicious.  I arrived about 9 PM, and service was very prompt."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. Arrived during the week for dinner. What use to be a diner has been transformed into a sushi bar and restaurant.

Service here was just average. I noticed only 1 waitress and 1 waiter taking care of all the tables which was insufficient.  As for the food, we ordered pork tonkatsu , teriyaki beef bento box and premium sashimi entree - quality of everything was solid and delicious. We finished with the green tea cheesecake parfait which was a hit too.

The experience of the sushi chefs definitely is displayed in the presentation and quality of food."}
{"text":"Excellent and extremely knowledgeable sushi chef Hiro. Fantastically prepared fresh fish, daily specials. Nice Japanese beer selection & detailed sake list by bottle or glass. Very nice to interact with the chef & owner Hiro at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Came here a second time just last week and I honestly planned my Vegas trip around visiting Tokyo Boys...

Dined in on Friday night around 11PM. We ordered 3pc of the shigoku oysters - It's part of their daily specials. I was looking for this last time I was here since I saw pictures of it on yelp but couldn't find it on the menu. I only had a chance to try one because I wasn't quick enough, boyfriend gobbled down the other 2 but it was good!

Also ordering from their specials, we got 2 pieces of the amberjack sushi and 2 pieces of the wagyu beef. Both were sooo delicious. The amberjack was topped with what appeared and tasted like fresh wasabi which complimented the fish. And the wagyu had this great texture and quality taste.

They didn't have the hamachi collar this time when we went but we got the salmon collar and it was just as good! The salmon was cooked perfectly, it had great grill marks on the outside which made the skin crispy but retained a lot of moisture on the inside. The fish practically fell off the bone as we went for it. We also got the 9 piece sashimi and then decided we were still hungry and asked for a recommendation on rolls - we got the roppongi roll and it seriously got better with each piece I had. I knew I would love the collar, I knew I would love the wagyu beef and the sashimi, but I was skeptical about any of their rolls which is why I didn't order any last time and wasn't planning to this time. So at first I was like okay, this is okay but eventually I found myself wanting more - so I stopped eating the collar just to focus more of my efforts on the roll. It's a spicy tuna and shrimp roll with tuna and smelt eggs on top. The sauce that they have accompany it is so good. 

My boyfriend and I love Tokyo Boys - he even made the joke of moving to Henderson just so he can eat there every day."}
{"text":"I doubt you can find another restaurant in Vegas that serves Umeboshi Chazuke. When chefs are willing to offer items that don't pander to the common denominator customer I take it as a signal that the chefs care about their food as much as they they care about turning a profit. We are lucky Hiro is this type of chef. If you drink, they have a well curated selection of  uncommon Japanese beers. 

For me eating out is sometimes a proxy for travel; seeing something foreign like Umeboshi Chazuke - a shiso, dashi, green tea, rice soup - leaves my giddy with anticipation, imagining I will soon know something more about a place halfway around the world without having to leave Vegas. 

Hiro cautioned me that it was a dish unfamiliar to the western palate and that I may want to try something else. Of course, being the pretentious foodie, I took Hiro's polite redirection as a challenge. Is this Chazuke something I will have all the time? No. But, I am glad for the opportunity to try a twist on a common Japanese breakfast and develop my understanding of the flavors within shiso and umeboshi. 

Hiro is a Japanese chef who has worked at big name joints on the strip, and thanks to his off strip location and desire to draw in customer we have the chance to enjoy fish that has never been frozen prepared by a skilled chef at off strip prices. If you are wonder why the larger sushi and sashimi prices seem higher than you have seen elsewhere off-strip, it is because these are fish you're only likely to see in places on the strip or at Kabuto. 

I was lucky enough to show up on a day when Tuna collar was available. It was larger than I am used too and perfectly grilled. I suspect that the other collars I've had were not butchered in the same manner as this cut. Hiro's decision to butcher the collar a particular way likely contributed to the proper texture of the final dish.  

Tokyo Boys does an excellent job of executing both the familiar American sushi as well as the traditional Japanese offerings. I look forward to going back, eating my way through the menu, and trying whatever new items Hiro is excited about serving."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here from time to time. When you walk up (and into the restaurant) you'll probably think it used to be a diner. It's not my absolute favorite place to get sushi, but it is good! My go-to dish is bara chirashi. Their portions are good and fish seems fresh. 

Parking has never been an issue, service isn't ever an issue. Food is good."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi spot! The fish is the freshest. We ordered the tuna roll, banzai roll, and tiger roll from here and they were some of the best rolls I've had. I'm not from the Las Vegas area, but I'll be sure to stop here whenever I come visit!"}
{"text":"I am glad my friend and daughter decided to join me for dinner to this great place. The food was so exquisite and the service was great.  We have gone to many different Sushi  places and this is definitely a great one!"}
{"text":"This place is aweful. Ordered yellowtail sushi and it was disgusting. Could only eat a single piece. Never again."}
{"text":"Compared to sushi in LA doesn't compare. But for Vegas I guess it's okay. service was good."}
{"text":"Heard this place is really good for their sushi and had to try I.T out myself to believe I.T. Never had salmon collar bone before so I definitely had to try I.T! For Nigiri I had fatty blue fin tuna, fatty salmon, yellow tail and tuna. 

This place serves both the fake wasabi and the real authentic root wasabi where it's grated and if you're about eating sushi then I'll have to recommend trying the root wasabi even though it's more expensive because you'll get a completely new experience. Not many place offers the authentic wasabi. 

Also seeing how packed this place is during dinner time already shows people this place is no joke!"}
{"text":"THE BEST Sushi in Las Vegas, period.
Hiro is a MASTER chef and a great guy.
The fish is the most fresh and of the highest quality
Presentation rivals that of Nobu.
Tokyo Boys is the best kept sushi secret in town.
This is where sushi chefs go for sushi after hours (truth)
Don't take my word, try it for yourself. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi place I have been to. It's surprising because of their location and hours so you don't expect much but this is now my go to for sushi. Every roll was neat and each one more delicious than the next! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of time, and every time it's been good.

I typically stick with the basic rolls, edamame, and the tempura.

The fish tastes fresh, and clean.  The service is prompt and friendly.  It's a great spot."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give 4.5 stars but Yelp won't let me. It was my first visit in, wife called in a carry out order from here around 10pm and was quoted a 30-40 min wait time. I was a little surprised, but figured they were either slammed busy or there was only sushi chef working. Turned out to be the latter, but I was ok with it.  We ordered a Tokyujo Chirashi (which was the more upscale/deluxe version of Chirashi) as well as a yellowtail w/onion roll and a few pieces of nigiri.

Chirashi - absolutely beautiful and thoughtful presentation even in a to go box. I wish I had the time to eat it there and not have to eat it out of a styrofoam container but oh well. As soon as I opened the box, the blend of fresh wasabi with the typical pseudo wasabi caught my eye. The plethora of different fish (some were seared/torched lightly which gave a nice smokey flavor) was amazing. I've also never had a Chirashi that has ikura, uni, toro, and a sweet shrimp in it. Absolutely amazing.

Sushi-so it turns out unlike the 90% of other sushi restaurants in the valley, their nigiri is sold individually whereas other places are 2 pieces per order. Their ingredients were extremely fresh, but their prices were a \"little\" bit higher than what I felt was market value. (This is where I dock half a star) Example: The Uni MP came out to about $7.50 each.  (Don't get me wrong, it was very fresh at least when I got it)

Just to put things into perspective, my take out order for two people came out to just under $76 after tax. If I were to do it all over again, I'd probably order some sort of sushi combo or just go with chirashi's."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend and my friend here for dinner. My boyfriend got the Bento  box with chicken and potstickers for his pick two. The chicken was kinda rubbery and lacked flavor. The salad here was good though. The sauce and cucumbers was what I liked in their salad. My friend and I ordered the 15pcs sashimi. You can make it a meal by adding $5 to pick two choices of either rice, soup, and salad. We also ordered the miso black cod, the soft shell crab, and white tiger roll. The white tiger roll was pretty good. Was highly disappointed in the soft shell crab and the miso black cod. I love miso black cod but the cod here was so small and it was $12! Kinda overpriced at this location. The soft shell crab was kinda soggy and I didn't care for it. The sashimi was fine but it was normal Sashimi as it would be anywhere else. My favorite was the green tea cheesecake for dessert. I would probably just come back here to get the cheesecake dessert. Our bill came to be pretty expensive for the food for 3 people. For the price we paid here I would have gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've been here twice both times it was nothing very memorable besides the fact that it looks like a 50s diner.  I appreciated that they were open till 1am on a Saturday night in such a residential area.   However they are really just a place to get full when nothing else is open. 

I was going to get a roll, but their options were not very exciting,  lots of cream cheese,  and most items for how simplistic they were seemed over priced.   I figured the bento box was the way to go.   I chose salmon teriyaki  and chicken katsu as my proteins.  

They first brought out miso soup, and both me and my date took one sip,  and never touched it again.  It just tasted like salt and water.   It was pretty gross.   Luckily the meal itself was more palatable.   

I appreciated the salmon still had it's skin on, and it was nice and flaky. It also rested on a bed of shredded veggie tempura which was a unique touch.   

The chicken katsu had an overly salted breading, and the cut of meat was not prepped in the best manner, so instead of being consistently tender, it had harder areas.   The dipping sauce could have used more ground sesame to round out the flavor.   The rice and side salad were just fine though. 

I found it interesting that they had a poster for the jiro dreams of sushi movie.   A very well respected sushi master in Japan.   Their food is so far removed,  and I feel they could really take some lessons from watching it to up their  own caliber of food.  Until then I will try to find other late night options if possible."}
{"text":"Some sushi rolls are better than others. Also we ordered the shrimp w/ jalepenos, too saltly and dry do not get this or the Japenese chicken. These are more appetizers for beer than anything else. The sushi was good but the prices do not match the amount of food your paying for."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really close to home yet we haven't been here in two years. I didn't remember disliking this restaurant on our first visit so I figured another visit was in order.

The service was great. Our waitress was waiting at the door as we entered and seated us right away. Soon after our drink orders were taken and then food orders. Drinks were refilled often and plates were cleared frequently. I also liked that the sushi was served as the orders came up instead of waiting until all of the rolls were ready. 

I started with edamame and a small house salad. I liked the dressing on the salad and that it was made with leafy greens. The edamame was pretty good. 

Our first roll was the Spider Roll. It was pretty good, but the portion was small. Next up was the White Tiger roll which was my favorite. This roll was a little larger and I loved the flavors and sauces. Lastly, we had the Blue Crab Roll which was on special. I didn't care for this, but my husband loved it. 

The food was decent, but I thought the price was high for the quality and portions. Maybe it would have been a better value if I'd been more strategic with which rolls I ordered, but it wasn't enough food for the cost."}
{"text":"How does this place have such high stars?! The only reason we came here was because of it's high ratings. When we got there, there were only 2 other guests. My intent was to order sushi however $7+ for a tuna roll or cali roll is ridiculous! These basic rolls cost about $4 else where! I decided against sushi ordered a bento meal for myself and my son. It comes with miso soup, rice, salad, and choice of 2 meats. However you can't order the same meats (no doubles) for some odd reason, it has to be 2 different meats. I still ended up ordering it however I just ordered 2 bento meals with teriyaki chicken and chicken katsu and just switched the meats myself.. The chicken katsu was super dry and the teriyaki chicken had no teriyaki sauce and was burnt. The only part of the meal that tasted as it should was the rice. My husband got two rolls despite the price however wasn't satisfied either. I don't mind high price sushi, but it better taste damn good if you are going to charge a high price. Sadly this place was a total bust for us and really makes me think twice about these yelp reviews/stars..."}
{"text":"So much meh. 
Food: meh selection, taste so-so, freshness- not there. 
Ambience: an old Wingers. Funky smell. 
Service: great. 
Price: over priced 

Not satisfied. The last time I let my friend Jesus pick a restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe I've haven't reviewed Tokyo Boys yet.  I've told my parents and friends to come here and support this family owned one-off Japanese sushi bar/restaurant helmed by an ex-Nobu alum but I just noticed I hadn't reviewed them after coming here so many times.  I usually forget to \"check in\" so it must've slipped my mind to give these guys a glowing 5-star review.  I usually get their bento box which gives you a variety of items (you get to pick the items)...all well executed.  Today I ordered something off the menu called a ten-toji don and the very nice server affirmed that they can make it for me...Yay!!  It turned out to be very good as well.  Sometimes I opt for sushi or a couple natto hand rolls here as well and everything is always spot on.  Service here is consistently friendly and prompt.  I am hoping if you are in the area, stop in and try this place out for some good nihon-shoku (Japanese food).  Try their sushi, cooked foods, or specialty rolls...they are all on point!   Nice to always see a friendly welcoming smile and greeting when I come in."}
{"text":"Can't believe I still haven't wrote a review of this place yet. This place has the BEST SPICY TUNA ever!! It's fresh and delicious. It is not an AYCE sushi joint but if you're looking for a place that will have good service and the food wont disappoint.. this place is the spot! The portion is smaller than other AYCE sushi places but it's because their fish is fresh. 

Why do I love this place? Because this place serves the freshest food. For example, I got the Tiger roll, which consists of spicy tuna, avocado, and shrimp tempura. The avocado was cut in front of us rather than being already cut and have left in the refrigerator. Also the shrimp tempura was crispy and warm. Usually, other sushi places, the tempura is cold so it really doesn't compare to this one. 

Also the server/hostess seems to be attentive which is nice. This place should get more people because it's a hidden gem! It's a must try (: 

P.S.: I don't remember all the pricing but it's around this price:
Spicy tuna roll:$6-7
Tiger roll: $15
Caterpillar roll:$12"}
{"text":"Poki salad was very good and so is Ama Ebi. Service was excellent. Overall, it was a very positive experienced. I will go back again and I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The food here is very good and the prices here are very reasonable to boot. Service is very good too. I asked for oshinko which was not on the menu and what I got was one of the best I ever tasted. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"First time here! My husband and I ordered the dinner combo. I had chicken teriyaki and he had the chicken and pork cutlet. I also ordered the spicy tuna! 

Best spicy tuna I ever had! I will try the nigiri portions next time!

The portions for the dinner combos were very generous, especially when I ordered the combo with tempura. Usually a mix tempura includes only 2 shrimp pieces, there were 3! It was the best tempura I ever had in my life tooooo!  

The pork cutlet my husband had was so so good! 

We are big on dinner bento combos at Japanese eats, and this one by far is the best we've had! 

I love that they are open till 2am, very convenient for us because we're parents and we sometimes eat late! Family friendly also. We will come again!"}
{"text":"We love coming to eat here.  Always fresh.  We ordered the cucumber salad,  crab puffs, roppongi roll (SOOOO good) and some nigiri. Definitely recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Me and hubby love this place. He gets the salmon teriyaki bowl and i get the beef teriyaki. The sauce is to die for!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, server was nice and helpful. Would recommend to friends. Clean area and good to watch sports. Price is decent and affordable. Special offer on the spider roll with live soft shell."}
{"text":"Really good sushi. Cool that it was set in an old dinner. Teriyaki chicken was not ok."}
{"text":"This is not one of those restaurants with all you can eat for $25.00. This is  a restaurant with fresh sashimi and quality food. We had a group of 7 and everybody enjoyed it. All the sashimi and sushi were delicious we had a lot of different sushi and sashimi dishes,although there was one sashimi my son didn't care for was the Japanese apple w/ tuna he said it was kind of different. The chicken karage, tempura shitsu peppers, katsu, and gyoza were great too! My favorite is the black cod w/ miso, just awesome. I also enjoyed  the crème brulee and the tempura ice cream. Will be back when we come to Vegas. Hiro is so friendly and accommodates something you want. This is what Japanese food should taste like and should be represented as."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi in a casual environment.  Although they're shooting for an authentic Japanese cuisine experience, the menu is very basic.  The specialty rolls had maybe a dozen to choose from.  Most places in Vegas have 3 to 4 dozen specialty rolls on the menu.  Overall my experience was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Delicious! Freshest fish in town. Melt in your mouth aji, mackerel, and sea urchin. Yummy green tea cheesecake for dessert."}
{"text":"Great local spot in Henderson for some good Japanese food.

Environment: this restaurant on the outside looks like an old diner. The inside is very clean, and the bar area is where the sushi chefs cut their fresh fish. The mood is still diner like, usually very quiet but now and then they have some large parties that gets rowdy. Also everyone who works here is Japanese so you know it is authentic.

Service: the place Is usually not too busy, but since they don't have too many people on hand, they may sometimes be a little late or forgetful in serving. Overall though, they are all very nice and work quickly. 

Food and drinks: the food is great. Their fish is very fresh, their udon which I also usually get with the tempura mix is so good. I also really like their salmon ikkura bowl. Everything about this place reminds me of Japan except for the diner appearance. They also have Japanese beer and sale you can select from, and for the kids a cute soda pop that you have to push a marble into.

This place is great for many occasions whether you want to enjoy a meal with a date or your family and kids. The food is authentic and fresh and is very nice since there aren't too many places like this in Henderson. The price is a little over average, but the overall experience with the food and drinks is good. This place is also open pretty late which I appreciate since I work late."}
{"text":"I was in Nevada for some business and when someone suggested getting sushi for dinner, I had my doubts...sushi in Henderson? That's practically the middle of nowhere to an LA girl such as myself. 

BUT...Tokyo Boys actually exceeded my expectations. 

I ordered the chirashi bowl which had a more-than-decent amount of fresh fish in it. And it even included some of the more non-standard items that I wouldn't have expected a sushi place in Henderson to have, such as sweet shrimp, scallops, and uni. My concern was that the bowl would just be filled tons of salmon and tuna (unexciting) but there was actually  lots of variety! Don't worry though, there's still pieces of salmon and tuna too. 

Most of the chirashi bowl was really good, except for a few bland pieces such as octopus and some of the unknown white fishes. Also, that sweet shrimp head was fried to perfection...mmm.

Cost: the food is a little pricey ($30+) but the quality was pretty good and the variety is great. 

Sorry I was so judgmental, Henderson sushi. Tokyo Boys proved me wrong."}
{"text":"Tokyo boys is a refurbished 50s style diner, but don't let that fool you from its truly authentic Japanese food. Hiro is a great chef and his creations are delicious as well as beautiful. If you get the chance to spend an hour or two definitely try the Omakase. Their fish tastes extremely fresh and they have fresh exotic fish in every day. I highly recommend the live lobster, nigiri platter, Kumamoto oysters, lobster miso soup, and uni. It can be pricey, but the quality and quantity of food you get is worth it. You can also go a cheaper route and not do the omakase and that's just as good."}
{"text":"Came here late night with the wife for some Vegas Sushi. I already knew from the start that it cannot compare to LA where we live but I'm optimistic when it comes to food. Being a born and raised in Vegas I know the food competition is fierce. So let me review...

First this place is a tad on the pricy side for what you get. Portions are not that big for what they are charging. I guess we are used to the LA and OC sushi places we normally eat at. But the food does taste fresh and is well made. 

The Sashimi was fresh and the best thing we had there. Got the Salmon, Smoked Salmon and the fatty Tuna, aka Toro Tuna. But again a little pricy for what you get. 

The Grilled Salmon was good and fresh. Came on a bed of tempura and teriyaki sauce. Simple yet good dish. 

The Roppongi roll was fair. For $15.00 I was expecting a little more of a spectacular taste but it was average. I've had better signature rolls from other Sushi joints. This was supposed to be one of their best and most popular rolls but we thought it was mediocre at best. 

What we did like was the Fresh Wasabi that came with the Sashimi. First time I've had that in a sushi place in Vegas. 

Finally the Katsu Curry was very tasty and a decent sized portion. It's definitely not on the generous portion size that you would get in LA. But still good. 

We were surprised this place was open so late because we were the only ones in there haha. It was a desolate Thursday night with no cars on the road or other guests inside. 

Server was very friendly and attentive. The chefs seemed to be a little on the shy and quiet side."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Henderson . Fresh fish, good service, friendly chefs. I eat here at least once a month.  Open till 2AM!"}
{"text":"Super clean fresh fish!! Best sushi I've had off strip!"}
{"text":"So went to this place because it was the only sushi place open at 11pm, and it was so expensive and the food was bad. (We really tried to like it) even the soy sauce was awful. We complained to the waitress but she said we \"ate too much\" to comp anything even though we offered to pay for what we did eat. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi, sashimi, chirashi, rolls, and everything place! I once got really sick after eating sushi boat at a different Japanese restaurant in Henderson...so I decided not to eat anymore sushi in Nevada at all...UNTIL I ate at Tokyo Boys :-). Their ingredients are super fresh and I never get sick after eating here. I get different things...sushi assortment, chirashi bowl, salmon bowl, rolls, and other things. Everything is fresh and delicious. Customer service is good as well. They are very welcoming and nice."}
{"text":"Every single dish was on point. Braised pork belly is a real standout as we're the Jalepeño Poppers! The real star was the 8 piece Omakase chef select sushi. Simple and amazing and sooooo fresh. I can't wait to come here again and again! It's 2 minutes from my house... lucky me!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, terrible service.  The staff is friendly but they have no clue about service.  Instead of getting the customers seated from the cold, they opted to take care of the bills first.  Once seated, it took a long time to get water and tea.  Again food was great, but they really need more than just two waitresses.  There are 4 uncleaned tables around me.  Getting refills for drinks takes a long time.  They also forgot one of our drink orders, it never came."}
{"text":"This now my favorite place for sushi in Henderson. I had passed by this place so many times and had it bookmarked just as long. I was under the impression this place would be way too expensive for me, so I figured I would save it for a special occasion. Well, Saturday was any special day as it could be and I decided I will finally give this place a try.

The outside looks like a diner, but I've noticed there are a couple of diners in the Henderson area that has been revamped to other restaurants. The inside was Japanese-esq and they made the diner structure work for them. The restaurant is very clean and I was welcomed right away. The booths were comfortable and the music playing was quite appealing. It wasn't distracting or off putting. I finally got to meet the Owner/Chef Hiro and he was extremely professional and warm at the same time. 

There is good selection of sake and they offer by the glass or the carafe. It could range from $12 a glass ( 5 oz ) or the bottle of upwards $200. There's something for everyone for sure and you can have it all without the stuffiness of the Strip. I went with the Sushi Combination of 7 pieces of the chef's pick and I got to pick one roll of my choice-I chose spicy tuna. When the plate came out it was beautiful and straightforward. My first bite had me over the moon. I knew I was in the hand of a master. The rice to fish ratio was balanced. Just enough vinegar to round out the fish flavor. The fish
was absolutely fresh, firm, and melted right my mouth. There was also a kick of wasabi that woke me right of my food zone too. Usually, the dab of wasabi in sushi seems to be an afterthought, but I felt that every piece of sushi was made with purpose and with the best quality available. Their wasabi definitely had a kick, but it was delicious. The sushi combination was under $20 and I was full enough. Quality makes a difference! There is a 12 piece Sushi Combination for under $30 if you want to try more pieces, which I might do next time. There are plenty of non-sushi options if you want too. All very affordable too. There are Donburi-Bowls and Noodles, Cold Dishes (I see you Summer weather!), Deep Fried, and Grilled menu items. I managed to save enough room for dessert and tried the Black Sesame Seed panna cotta. It was served in a glass cup with a dollop of  whipped cream. It was velvety, almost chocolate like with a nutty undertone. Nicely chilled, but not too cold. I would definitely order this dessert again. They are open at dinner time 5 p.m. till late 1 a.m. and closed on Mondays. I will save my calories for dinner! 

I know when I mention sushi, people immediately want to know if AYCE is available, which is fine, but I think we tend to forget that sometimes you get what you pay for. Can you get a decent meal at an AYCE place? Sure and by all means that's ok. What I'm saying is, this is a dining spot. Not the mass producing factory set up that most of us got introduced to sushi to. Give this place a try, expand your horizons and you'd be surprised at what you can appreciate at how simple and complex sushi can be at the same time. Domo!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here and ive never had a bad experience.  The sushi is consistantly delicious and fresh.  This is not an all you can eat sushi with crazy rolls. The pricing is very reasonable for quality sushi and they have a great lunch deal if u get there before 230."}
{"text":"Nothing outstanding. But if you want to be nickel and dime for even more wasabi, be prepair to pay extra for it , even it doesn't come enough with your sushi  !!! Come to this place. The service person is unresponsive to any comments you make."}
{"text":"I nice, simple sushi café that is quiet, clean and friendly.  The food was A-1 in both presentation and quality.  Sashimi was cut nice and thick, with great flavor, I like the fatty salmon and it was perfect.  And the dinner salad was super fresh with lettuce variety, radish, carrot and light miso/ginger dressing - tasty.  Nice selection of Nippon beers, even a dark dray beer from Asahi that was crisp. Service was good too, perfect timing.
Def will come back here."}
{"text":"This place was great!  We walked in at 10:00pm  hungry and thirsty.. the food came out fast! everything we had was GREAT!  from the Salt & Pepper shrimp to the Plum Ice cream..."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality. 
2 tables and 2 servers and the service was horrible. 
Won't come here again"}
{"text":"This is not for the foodie that likes fusion or American-ized Japanese food.  I was born in Tokyo so these flavors and textures really take me back to my hometown.  The gyoza is carefully burnt, the udon and soup base cannot get any more authentic.  The miso soup is supposed to be special and it was good but nothing I would go back for.  The yellowtail hamachi was good however maybe a couple green onions on top or something to it would've helped.  To top it off I had one of the best creme brulee I have had, but caution to those who like over sweet desserts, Japanese people make their sweets almost bittersweet lol.  Another huge plus is they use an efficient filter system for everything so even their tap water tasted pure, and their regular iced tea that I thought was some special tea tasted so good!  I can taste and smell EVERYTHING so even a hint of freezer burn or dirty tap makes me cringe lol.  The service is what you typically expect at a Japanese restaurant, not a lot of chatter or over friendliness, just efficient service and enough space for you to enjoy your food.  I want to return to try more sushi."}
{"text":"I love the ambience of this place! It feels like I'm in Riverdale eating at Pop's but instead of eating burgers, I'm eating sushi!. Lol.

The dishes were hit or miss (mostly the sushi), I definitely recommend the salmon sushi, the rainbow roll and the calamari! 

The misses to me were the tempura roll, I was expecting it to have that crunchiness of the tempura but it ended up being soft and a bit lukewarm tbh. Definitely had better tempura rolls. 

Though the sushi's were hit or miss, the service is definitely a hit! We were greeted upon entering and seated promptly. Our server was nice and accommodating and answered all our questions without hesitation. Food came out quickly and our server always refills our water. 

The dessert was really good. I just forgot the name, it has a pudding/ jello consistency and it's not too sweet and definitely hits the spot. Edit: its the Black Sesame Panna Cotta"}
{"text":"Food was yummy.We had several different types. Owner and chef was at the counter. Not too friendly. Seems to stay on the far side of the counter and just chat with one customer. I would go back.but, I sit up there to \"be a bit social\" that's what it's for. He was not. Booth it is! Great fresh fish. They where out of a lot.but had many other friendly suggestions."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place!  We're from the Philadelphia area and were in town for a soccer tournament.  Read the reviews and had to give it a try.  We were not disappointed!  We ordered a bunch of dishes and several rolls and everything we ate was superb!  We thought the price was in line with the quality of the ingredients used."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!   I first discovered Tokyo Boys when I was out staying at Westin Lake Las Vegas for a conference.   I was so blown away by it that 2 nights later I entertained some clients and colleagues and we had a nice \"party\"  - - a fun night with awesome food.   I cannot wait to return - and will definitely add pictures!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the tempura shrimp and vegetable mix! And the Teriyaki Chicken was most excellent. I would recommend this place to anyone, it was very good!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing!!!! The Sashimi is some of the best I've had. The ginger is bright yellow and super fresh. The service is great. Hiro is a not only a great chef, but a pretty amazing person. Do yourself a favor and come here!!! I've been here 3 days in a row!!!"}
{"text":"THIS TRULY IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Having traveled extensively in Japan for work this is as close as I have gotten to the quality sushi from there. The Owner/chef was very friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming and it is open late. The real story here is the fish...SO FRESH! prepared beautifully if you love real sushi and sashimi spend the extra bucks and get the chirashi! A big bowl of sushi rice covered with premium cuts of everything! I shared one and had a roll of my own and I was full and happy. The other thing of note is the miso....It is actual miso! Made there and soooo good! Fresh wasabi ( if you've never had it you just don't know!) incredible. The rice is artfully prepared and that after all is where great sushi begins. Don't miss out it is the best sushi in Vegas and Henderson. I am sorry to all the other sushi places in town... If they need to reach me they will find me at Tokyo Boys! Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Delicious and filling food. The portions are huge for the price so its all worth it. The servers were very attentive. Will definitely come back and highly recommend this to anybody who is looking for yummy Japanese food!"}
{"text":"I love to watch Chef Hiro work, his dedication and passion create a beautiful, high quality sushi experience."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd best sushi we've had in Las Vegas after 8 years of trying different places.  And the best for the price.  Wood definitely come back here, even though it is on the other side of town.  Loved the owner and the sushi.  It is rare to find someone who imports Japanese scallops!"}
{"text":"Sushi was delicious even at 12am. Great flavors and so fresh tasting. Prices are a little high and you think this late they would have a happy hour. (If they had one I bet it would bring a lot more business.)
First time I ordered a spider roll and they serve you a separate dipping sauce. Which was amazing! It had a nice little kick to it. It is the same sauce they serve you when you just order soft shell crab as an appetizer. But it was nice dipping my roll in it instead of the wasabi and dash of soy sauce I usually use. 
Definitely will be coming back for my late night sushi carvings."}
{"text":"when we drove up to this converted diner i was doubtful . once seated we were given a warm welcome and menus. its real easy to get bad hot japanese food.but the menu had a lot of options most ala carte but with a $5 add on for a complete meal with soup salad and rice. we had gyozas and cal rolls for starters . the cal rolls had what we call \"good aji\" meaning flavor and taste. gyozas disappeared quickly. orders of grilled salmon,teriyaki chicken,beef , pork katsu were not overly greasy and tasty. the salads were big and fresh . constant refills of water and sodas without asking was wonderful.dont know about the sushi since we didnt order any. but i would come back here in a heartbeat when I'm jonesing for hot japanese dishes."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi I ever had! The owners Hiro and Junko were amazing.  When we ordered we had them make us whatever they wanted and I have to say that everything was amazing.  This is the ONLY sushi place I will eat at when I'm in Vegas.  It was a pleasure and honor to meet you both Hiro and Junko.  Thank you very much.  Cory & Andrea from Colorado."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch during the week at Tokyo Boys.  I didn't realize they close at 2:30, and I walked in a little after 2.  But, they seated me and were totally friendly, I didn't feel rushed at all.  I tried the roppongi, which is a spicy tuna roll with shrimp and topped with tuna.  This was a large roll which had some kick to it.  It was very flavorful and I loved the sauces.  This is a winning roll and I would order it again.

I also tried the karaage and gyozo appetizers.  The gyozo were pretty typical dumplings, hot with a nice sear on the underside.  I really enjoyed the karaage, or crispy fried chicken.  It was dark meat chicken, so it retained some flavor and juiciness.  It was very crispy.  My only request would be a little more salt/seasoning.  These were also winners, I'd get them again.

The place is large and comfortable, and appeared very clean in the area of the restaurant I was in.  I hope it does well, this location has been snakebit for a few years.  Seems like it's finally found a winner."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Quality food and reasonably priced!!! Strip quality and taste, a huge fan and will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I've been here too many times to count that I think it's finally time I give this place recognition. It irks me when I see negative reviews on this place because of a biased, unfortunate experience that seems to usually be, the person's fault them self. 

First off, the sushi is the best! Before I ever had food from this place, I was a fond, avid eater of \"all you can eat sushi\". It was cheap and what seemed good to me when I was ignorant about food. All this sushi for a cheap price? I was in! But that's because I never had authentic, quality sushi. 
When it comes to getting raw fish, I have 3 top orders here. Either a Roppongi roll, a sushi combination, or the famous Tokujyo Chirashi. What I get depends on how hungry I am and what I feel like. 
If I want a roll, the Roppongi is my go-to. I'm a big tuna lover and this roll has spicy tuna and shrimp inside while still being topped with regular tuna. On top of that, this roll bursts with flavor! It has like a garlic ponzu and masago (smelt roe) on top that adds that extra \"mmmf\". 
If I feel like sushi, I'll get a combo; 7 pieces if I'm not too hungry, 12 pieces if I'm feeling ballsy. Anyways, it's perfect because it comes with a variety of fresh, sushi from quality fish that melts in your mouth and aside from the amount of pieces you get, it also comes with a roll of your choice from the 4 roll list options! I get it with a spicy tuna and mmmm so yummy! *On that note* the spicy tuna rolls here aren't minced weird mixtures of tuna, they're actually slices of tuna with spicy mayo! Nothing better than real, yummy tuna! 
Then if I'm feeling super hungry and craving for a huge variety of fish, I get the Tokujyo Chirashi. This dish is a bowl of rice, topped with almost every fish in the restaurant, even Uni! I've never been a fan of Uni but since I've tried it here, there are days when I'll just crave it alone. Not only that, along with the sushi combos, it comes with miso soup! Which is the best miso soup I've ever had because they make it fresh in the restaurant from the \"mugi miso\" plant. 
Before this meal, I might get an appetizer (which could be a meal but share it and you got you and your friends a delightful app)! With that, it will either be the Karaage or Salt and Pepper shrimp. 
I'm a HUGE lover of fried chicken and I'd have to say, the Karaage (Japanese style fried chicken) here, is some of the best fried, let alone CHICKEN, I've ever had. It's marinated when ordered then deep fried and topped with salt and pepper. I don't know what it is about the salt and pepper at this place but it definitely has a different taste of spice to it. I take my 1 year old niece here with me often and she loves this chicken as much as I do.  
With the salt and pepper shrimp, the flavoring is similar but it's shrimp instead, also with jalapeños for a little spiciness on top. Not only that, the shrimp is soft shell so you can eat the whole thing! It's different and delicious! 
There's many desserts here that are a hidden gem because it seems most people don't talk about them. Junko (owner and waitress), homemakes some of the desserts and I'd have to say, her Green Tea Cheesecake is my all time favorite. 
The Green Tea Cheesecake is not sliced, but cheesecake in a cup instead. With that, it's different because it's a nice mousse, instead of the heavy cheesecake we're used to. Also, I'm a matcha (real green tea) fanatic, so when I taste the matcha in this cake, it brings me joy. The whole thing altogether is like sweet serenity. 
Overall, the quality, value, service and experience is one of a kind. There's a reason why I always come back, maybe you will too."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the Uni here. I mean it was good but not worth $10 a piece. We only got 4 piece. Price was not listed for them so we were pretty shock when we got the bill. We eat Uni pretty often and never have I eaten at a place that cost this much."}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi there are three critical keys, fresh, fresh and fresh. Oh boy! Their fish was so fresh. We went there on a Mon night. There were not a whole lot of dinners so it's quiet and their service was awfully efficient. Toro, eel, uni, scallop, ... all melted in my mouth. What a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"I must be honest I a did not like the old 50s diner look on the outside of the building but my review is purely on the food an the service. Food was what I can only compare to what I have experienced at overpriced strip restaurants.  If you have been to some of the big name Japanese restaurants and appreciate good Japanese food I suggest you give this a try.

I trusted the chef to send what he recommended.  I don't do reviews often so I can only remember so much but I ate way too much. I loved the oysters from Washington and many orders of fish from Japan. The chef worked for some of the best in vegas and explained he wanted to bring the high end food to a local place.  I never even saw the menu but what stood out the most to me was what I would call a tuna sample, the shigoku oysters and the green tea cheese cake.  

If you can live without the ambience of fine dinning I suggest you check it out next time you are in Henderson.  I will be back again and feel foolish for not going sooner."}
{"text":"Simply put, this is one of the best off strip Japanese restaurants in Las Vegas.  And matches up very well with the heavyweights on the strip in the quality of their food.  Though one can't expect a small restaurant to offer the quantity of items a place like Nobu does, the quality of the items Tokyo Boys offers is generally on par with the best of anything in Las Vegas.  I'd put Tokyo Boys and Roku in the very top tier of off strip Japanese restaurants.  You'll get more selection at Roku, but you don't have to wait to get seated at Tokyo Boys and the prices are more reasonable."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised to find an excellent Japanese restaurant in Henderson.  The sushi, bento, fried chicken(Karaage), udon was so good that we came back for the 2nd night round of dinner. I have visited many Japanese restaurants around the world and I think Tokyo Boys is just as good or better.  

When I am in Henderson again, I will visit this place again."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in all of Vegas! My husband and I come here at least 5 times a month and I always get the tokujyo chirashi. The food and ingredients are always fresh and the service is always amazing. Definitely a loyal customer to Tokyo boys!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing late night sushi the service is awesome and they always make me feel welcome even when its really late and I'm tired and I just got off of work I will always come here for late night sushi"}
{"text":"Nice selection of saki. If you can't figure out one choice, they have sampler options. This is a great and legit sushi bar where the sushi chefs greet everyone who comes in the door and craft delicious masterpieces."}
{"text":"Don't be misguided by the exterior. This is authentic Japanese cuisine. Me and my boyfriend came in Late on a Friday night after work. We sat by the sushi bar and got to watch the chefs prepare the dishes. We went with Spicy tuna which was so fresh and tasty. Jalepeno peppers loaded with spicy tuna Cream cheese and tempura fried to perfection. We also had Unagi and the philly my personal fav but we had it tempura fried with extra eel sauce. For dessert I had mango Mochi since it wasn't huge and I was pretty stuffed.  Everything was so fresh and our Sous Chef Mike was awesome. Will definitely be coming back to try more items from the menu."}
{"text":"Sushi was exceptional, I mean I had my fix. Also the Tokyo Sparkling cocktail was phenomenal . Only downfall was that the service took FOREVER . Me and my boyfriend arrive around 840, very little customers and quiet for the more part . We simply ordered a few sushi rolls and miso soup , THAT'S IT . I received my first plate of sushi while my bf had nothing. I finished my plate, only to find myself ordering more . I had to inform the server up bring the food all at once, but Unfortunately the miso soup took such an extended time (due to them making a fresh batch) we ended up canceling that order and asking for the check. Overall as a first time customer great food and staff, but their deliverance of food sucked and she should've informed us about the soup, otherwise things would've worked out ."}
{"text":"Sun/16 Aug about 6 pm I was here because the The Great Greek and a Kebab place were closed on Sundays.
- Had the 2 item bento box to go which includes rice, salad, tempura (no miso soup when the bento box is take out).  All the sides and the 2 items of small portion salmon teriyaki and small portion beef teriyaki were good but the box being $14+tax, overall seemed overpriced."}
{"text":"I look forward to coming back to this restaurant the next time I am in town. Hiro goes to the fish market every morning and you will also seeing him working the sushi bar with Isao. Anytime I eat sushi, I always sit at the bar for the complete experience and while you can't go wrong with either one, I'd say Hiro is the more talkative one and really made my day with one of the best omakase experiences that I've ever had...all the while in an immaculate 50's diner.

The first night I had the menu omakase, which was good, but you'll probably have to order a few more items. 

The second night, I had a more authentic off-the menu omakase which cost me $120. That may sound like a lot to those who don't regularly dine sushi, but for those who can truly appreciate this type of traditional experience, it is a bargain for what you get. It's not for everyone, but that's why there are other things like rolls and cheaper sushi available here too."}
{"text":"Pretty good place, best sushi in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Very good.... 

Authentic Japanese cuisine. Now, to be fair there are a TON of sushi Resturant's in Vegas... but, for being way out in Henderson It's a GREAT choice. 

Food was fresh, service was prompt and the wait staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Not bad.  A little bit high priced.  Sushi is sold as one piece.  
The wait for our order was too long,  it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"I've been going here every couple of weeks for almost a year now and it never disappoints. The sushi is quality, fresh and well priced. The service is super friendly. I like the diner atmosphere, casual and comfortable. They have Asahi and Orion beer on draft. As a bonus they have some great dessert options. I love having this spot so close o home."}
{"text":"Never judge a book by it's cover. That's what I learned today when I walked inside Tokyo Boys and saw two, actual, Japanese men behind the sushi bar. This is huge. Japanese people take pride in what they do and work every single day to improve their skills, especially with sushi. It is extremely rare to find that level of commitment at any sushi restaurant in the US and I've had the honor to taste it at Tokyo Boys. If you want to eat a bunch of low grade cheap sushi go to another place. If you want competitively priced sushi that smashes the competition in quality, taste, and texture go to Tokyo Boys. Even the Ebi tasted amazing. I got the sushi lunch special and always eat the Ebi first since it's usually low grade. When I tasted it here, I knew this place was something special. The search for my regular sushi spot has ended with the best sushi I've ever tasted. A million hand shakes Tokyo Boys. Well done."}
{"text":"Like the food had lunch here one day ordered a bento box and it was good..be prepared to spend $20 for yourself for a great lunch sushi was great I just think they need the business to get the prices down..keep this place open!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I use this place for an occasional date night. It's easy on the wallet and theres some pretty good specialty rolls here. All the classics and a different atmosphere than most other sushi joints in the area. I like its character and the sake!!!! Super friendly staff- would never say a bad word about the place"}
{"text":"Seriously. Are they paying for fake reviews?? Gave this turd burger another shot and I suppose the upside is neither of us got violently sick this time. Way to go Tokyo Boys! You suck marginally less than the first time."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot that stays open late.  All Japanese crew makes this place very authentic.  Fish was great and the service was perfect.   I'll be going back to this place any time I'm in Las Vegas.  Try the special \"taco\"!"}
{"text":"What a little gem! I've driven by this place so many times and always thought it was a weird building for a Japanese restaurant...I didn't think it would actually be good! But I was in for a great surprise. 

The staff was super friendly and all of our food arrived to our table quickly. They play oldies and I love how they kept it looking like an old school diner in the inside!  It was clean and of course the food was delicious. Everything tasted really authentic. When you go there, definitely get the Japanese lasagna. You won't regret it!

Side note: we ate here around 9:30pm. I read some reviews about the service being slow. Maybe it depends on the time of day? We had no issues with slow service during this time :-)"}
{"text":"This place is a true oasis in over priced Las Vegas.    Amazing Sushi."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii and getting fresh fish for high prices, this place gives you the high quality of fresh fish, but with a much better pricing. I truly enjoyed this place, as service was spot on and food came out in a timely manner. Did not have to wait long after putting an order in. This is truly a fine dining type of meal and on my next visit will definitely be returning. I highly recommend this place. The must try was the Jalapeño Hamachi and the fish tacos which were the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"An interesting and fresh Japanese restaurant in Henderson.

Environment: The exterior as well as the interior for this restaurant Is intriguing to say the least. Styled to be like a vintage diner, Tokyo Boys has the booths, barstools, and overall styling to lead one to believe it would be any type of restaurant other that a more traditional, izakaya-style Japanese restaurant.

Food: As I mentioned above, the restaurant leans more towards traditional Japanese food as opposed to all-you-can-eat style which focuses most on creating interesting rolls, or the fusion restaurants which have become commonplace in the city. They have an assortment of seafood dishes, rice bowls, and chirashi selections which allows a lot of variety when ordering. The salmon-ikura don is one of my favorite and the tempura udon is delicious as well. The shishito peppers and the takosu are a couple of my favorite appetizers. Additionally, they have a nice list of Japanese beers and sake to pair with the food menu.

Service: Service is generally very nice and attentive, with the server giving you time to look over the menu while still being sure to stop by and check in as well as refill any drinks or add in any additional orders when necessary.

Overall, this is a restaurant which has a lot to offer to the residential area of Henderson. The late hours of operation and refreshing menu allow this to be somewhere I come frequently."}
{"text":"OMG one of the best kept secrets. Very fresh fish, beautiful presentation!! Chef took great pride in the finished product he provided us.

Not all you can eat but worth the money!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and loved it each time. Rolls and sashimi are always on point. Prices can't be beat for what you get. Place is typically quite and not busy which makes it a lot more intimate. Will continue to visit and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I always leave satiated and satisfied. Sushi here is always top quality and the customer service is fast, efficient and friendly. Because of all this I have been a regular for several months. They are open late too for those midnight cravings."}
{"text":"The food was great but it's a bit too pricey when we pulled up there was no customers the place was empty, but after 1hour later people started coming in I guess they have certain times when they are dead, good had good flavor staff ok, may go back sometime"}
{"text":"This place is traditional Japanese and its all about the quality. The sushi, grilled saba and karage chicken was on point. The sushi seriously melted in my mouth."}
{"text":"My husband, friend from out of town and I dined here on a Friday night during a huge monsoon. We enjoyed numerous types of very fresh Sashimi, sushi rolls, japanese eggplant, and an assortment of Sake, and let me just saw, this is THE BEST sushi in town! The place is newly opened but you can already tell that Hiro, the chef and owner knows what he is doing! He is an excellent Chef that has worked in the best restaurants all over. His wife Junko is so personable and sweet and makes all of the desserts herself! My husband and I will dine at this new and beautiful restaurant a lot, and it will be our favorite place for fresh japanese food!!!! Go here, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Henderson, come here!!! Try everything, this time place is delicious and he makes original stuff....wow"}
{"text":"Always leave here satisfied. I eat here about once a month. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Never got around to posting before but I've been here enough times where I'm confident enough to say the food is always been excellent and consistent. I highly dislike restaurants where sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not. 

The only thing this place could do to make it even better is if was open all day! Sadly they follow a more traditional Japanese schedule of only being open for lunch and dinner. It is a great place to eat after a night out drinking!

It is a little on the pricey side but is completely worth it if you just want good traditional Japanese food. Do not let the outside look of an American diner fool you into not giving this place a try. 

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The sushi is good. My only complaint is that the restaurant smells awful. Very strong fishy smell. Killed the mood. Not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"Best sushi bar on the east side. Family owned by Hiro and his wife who are there every day of the week. Hiro is passionate about his craft which is evident in his food, both sushi and cooked. This is not an AYCE place. Real sushi lovers only! If you love traditional nigiri and live items while rejecting Americanized cream cheese containing rolls, this is your spot. I've been eating sushi since I was 3. This is the real deal and better than any over-hyped Strip sushi spot at half the inflated Strip price. Try it. If you don't love it send me a message and I'll buy you a drink. But you will."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great opening hours and fun location! No con's... Had \"Screeming O\" as entree and plum ice cream as dessert and its was fantastic! Will come back soon again!!!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic omakase dinner and this one is in Henderson to boot??  Damn, double damn, triple damn!!  Chef Hiro sent our group on a voyage of delicious oceanic treats that had taste buds swooning and eyes bulging.  His attention to detail and cool presentation was a revelation that has my stomach yearning to return like a kid to Disney World. 

If you're not a picky eater and don't mind missing out on cream cheese for your Japanese dinner, letting the chef do his thing is definitely the way to go.  They know what is freshest that day and the element of surprise makes the meal more fun than the Criss Angel show. That's not a high bar to exceed, still......  

Being a self-professed tuna fiend, the first plate of big eye, akami and chutoro had me giddier than my sister in law at a New Kids on the Block concert.  The first mouthful of the medium fatty tuna sent me into sushi bliss and was an ideal way to kick off dinner.

Other exceptional nigiri pieces included the incredible cut of hamachi, the oyster whose plumpness and juiciness was greatly accentuated by the Chef steaming it with sake for fifteen minutes, and the homemade uber-tender tako.  Last but not least, Chef Hiro's \"Saba Five Ways\" was an absolute delight.  Each piece of mackerel was of different origin and taste and all supremely oishiiiiiiiii!  Goddamn!!! I want all my food to be served 5 ways!

I'll be at Denny's all like \"Sir? I'll take bacon, but I want it 5 ways. I'll take a side of eggs, 5 ways as well, and please send over the sommelier, I have 5 questions.\"
 
$80 got me 18 pieces of sushi (including otoro currently at $14 a piece), 2 unbelievably fresh oysters, a spoonful of awesome uni and dessert.  I would gladly shell out for this again and again and again."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Vegas. This sushi place is in a 50's looking diner building and the food is just as surprising. The quality of the fish here is amazing for the price. They even have daily specials at the bar with super high quality slices that are worth every extra penny. They even have my favorite Orion and Echigo beers!!"}
{"text":"Just awful. The service was atrocious, and the prices were even worse! They wanted to charge us $15 for a dragon roll woth artificial crab in it. We first asked our server, when she finally bothered to come around, if we could have real crab instead, she told us she didn't think they had real crab and disappeared for another 5 mins. When she finally returned, we explained that we saw on the menu that they do have soft shell crab and we would like the dragon roll with soft shell crab instead of imitation crab, she huffily disappeared again only to return to tell us that they would charge us $20 for the roll if we wanted real crab, so we said no thanks. The rolls we did order were good and the fish was fresh, but it was no fresher or better than any local AYCE place. We were terribly disappointed with the service, quality, prices, and selection. If you're in the area looking for a sushi place, go down the street to Momo.  Way better, cheaper, and better service and selection. Oh, and the first time we tried to go to tokyo boys they were closed even though their hours on the door said they were open, and yelp said they were open. If you are going to foolishly try this place, I recommend you call first and make sure they bothered to open that day."}
{"text":"It's like we were forgotten and it was my partner's birthday. Horrible and we have come in the past no issues. But I will never come here again after this experience. 

Food was good so it's unfortunate."}
{"text":"If I could only go negative stars. 

I went here based off these very reviews and they may have had an off night but man I felt it immediately. Most everyone in my party had upset stomach causing everyone to rush home. 

The food was sub par and most of all the customer service was terrible and argumentative. Which is odd for a party that walks in with 9 people. You'd figure with that many people running up a decent sized tab, they'd be more attentive but no. 

This place is on my no go list."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite items tonight:

Ahi poki. So fresh, tender, and pieces were quite large. They sat on a bed of seaweed salad, which was good too!

Oysters. I could appreciate the ponzu sauce it was sitting in. But I like my oysters to have that ocean taste. And this didn't. It tasted fresh, but without that ocean taste, it could've also been previously frozen.. So.. Who knows.

Amaebi. The sweet shrimp was fresh, sweet, and the heads were PERFECTLY fried!

The roppongi roll. Best roll tonight! There was a mixture of lots of different fish. I reeeeally enjoyed this one. If you're going to order a roll, order this one.

Salmon skin hand roll. WOW. I would come back if only for this! The salmon skin was crispy and warm. The rest of the roll was a perfect combination of rice and veggies. We had to order seconds because it was sooo good!

The customer service was also great. Not sure if they were down a sushi chef tonight but there was only one. So all our orders took awhile to get to the table. But for compensation for our time, chef Hio gave us a bottle of sake on the house. It made waiting that much more fun :)

I'd come back!

Oh I almost forgot!! Ask for fresh wasabi! Its so great with all the sushi. Not sure if it costs extra, but it'd totally worth it!"}
{"text":"My first time here. They are just what I love in a sushi bar! It is owner operated, sushi is fresh, they post the specials, nice people on both sides of the bar, clean, smells fresh, beer made in Japan!"}
{"text":"Buen lugar para comer sushi clásico, variado y fresco.
Los precios son accesibles.
El ambiente es un tanto extraño ya que está situado en un antiguo dinner o cafetería norteamericana y los dueños decidieron dejarlo así aunque vendan sushi.
El servicio correcto y amable.
El ambiente un poco triste ya que eramos los únicos en el local (no entendimos porque un local con tan buena reputación y calidad estaba vacio a la hora de la cena)
Recomendable."}
{"text":"My friend and her boyfriend treated me to dinner here. I have to say, I was really excited to try this place for a long time but was a little disappointed. I felt like I had better quality and tasteful sushi at an AYCE sushi place. We ordered their 15 piece sashimi, miso black cod, tempura soft shell crab and a sushi roll. The cod was very good but a very small portion. Soft shell crab was a bit soggy and sashimi was good quality but not great. I did like the roll and green tea cheesecake parfait! Dessert was the best part."}
{"text":"The space is what appears to be an old diner, and I actually believe at one point was a Hawaiian BBQ joint..the interiors haven't changed.. the music tracks are the same and it's in need of a good cleaning.

We were excited because it has 4.5 stars and we were in need of some good Sushi so we made the drive to Henderson from the Northwest side of town.

The service was average to slow.. but we were in no rush so we were unaffected by it.

The food was average at best.. some of the rolls were good not great and some were just not very good. 

The deserts were bad.. the tempura ice cream was supposed to be a take on deep fried ice cream.. the oil was not hot enough when they cooked it.. so oil soaked doughy ice cream is what came out..

Not worth the drive and won't be back.."}
{"text":"The food was ok but we never received all of our food. We ordered a sushi roll and a meal to share but never received the sushi which was the reason we came. With it being Valentine's Day it was a little disappointing as it put a damper on the night. May give them a try another time it was good enough for a second chance"}
{"text":"This is one good sushi restaurant which has it's own unique taste.  They are amenable to make your order to your own preferences.  They have fresh fish, good but slightly slower than most sushi restaurants at gettting your order to the table.  They'll accomodate your special requests."}
{"text":"Excellent and Gluten free. 6 stars. I wish there were places this good in California. Service was great also!"}
{"text":"Took yelper's advice and got the delicious pork belly & japanese lasagna, I also ordered my favorites agadashi tofu, tuna poke salad, & miso black cod and they were prepared excellently. We arrived early so it was kind of quiet and we received excellent friendly service. Finished our meal with the tempura ice cream (also delicious) and looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"One of my fav sushi place in Henderson!! Quality of fish is heaven sent. And extra point for Japanese own restaurant. If you eat a lot of sushi you can tell if the place know how to make authentic sushi by just tasting the rice. It does taste different. AYE places can't get to this quality."}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place for almost 2 years now.  The quality of the fish is comparable to Kabuto but the prices are much more reasonable.  They've always got two types of toro (chutoro and otoro) and they are always out of this world.  There is always something unique and special on the board in addition to their regular selections, and they have a wide variety of cooked dishes that are really good as well, unlike most sushi places where the cooked food is an after thought.  I never come in without having some takoyaki and salt and pepper shrimp. Even the desserts are really good, which is the last thing you expect when going out for sushi.

Beyond the food, the service is good and friendly and they have a good selection of beer and sake, from dirt cheap carafes to moderately expensive bottles."}
{"text":"Amazing! We're from Seattle and used to great Sushi so it takes a lot to impress us- we're impressed! Super clean, very friendly and fresh menu. The sushi rolls are generously sized and they offer a variety of great appetizers, especially the fried oysters and salt & pepper shrimp."}
{"text":"Most authentic Japanese sushi in town. Fresh cuts of fish that you won't find anywhere else. Service is amazing and you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Came here when my boyfriend came back home early from military training & it was a late night sushi date. It was very quite & we were able to enjoy our food & chatting with the sushi chef. The love boat was definitely delicious but I don't think I would let him spent that much money on sushi again."}
{"text":"Still my go to place. Hiro and crew are terrific. The food is always delicious. So fortunate to have this place as my neighborhood sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time in and we had a great experience. On top of the fact that the food was amazing, we got really good service. Our waitress was helpful with the menu and ordering and was on top of our drinks! We ordered an appetizer, Screaming Orgasm, yes that's the name! It was really good! We had a couple sushi rolls which were great! I recommend the Banzai Roll! Then we ordered the Chirashi, a first for us, and it was so good! We will be back for the super fresh seafood and good service!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Henderson. The only place that serves fresh wasabi, & fish are always fresh. This place us a little bit pricey but it's worth it .Authentic Japanese Cuisine!love it!"}
{"text":"For whatever reason, I really enjoyed this place. As soon as I walked in, I got greeted not just by the host but the chefs as well. When we sat down, the waitress came up and was overly friendly. She was so nice! It was such a pleasure talking to her. The table was clean, it had a unique design, and it wasn't very loud. Such a great restaurant!

Aside the facility, the food was on point as well. I got the bento box and it was some of the best tasting food I've had in a while. Just beware of the bizarre times it's open. I've tried to go before and it was closed.. I think it was 3:30 in the afternoon. At the end of the day, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Not super impressed with my first experience at Tokyo. The waitress wasn't helpful in offering suggestions of good rolls to sample. The sushi I did order didn't seem very fresh or have a real distinct flavor. The atmosphere was kind of strange too, it reminded me of a 50s type diner, and the odd music just made the whole experience sub par."}
{"text":"Ok we came Herr because they're was a bunch of positive reviews but our experience want that great. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and polite. But the food wasn't worth the money at all. There sushi was small, barely any rice and liked like it was made for my 3 year old. I ordered the rib eye, medium. It came well done and was tasteless. My husband ordered the Saba. Again the portion was itty bitty. The tempura was oily. The tiger roll, holy tell them to hold the sauce, our was swimming in the eel sauce. Thanks but no thanks, we won't be back, sorry."}
{"text":"For my 200th review it thought that it should only be fitting that is is a 5 star joint. 

Here's the story:

We were headed to the bank and the auto mall to run some errands. Lo and behold, we see this shiny old school diner building to the left. So we jump to you yelp app and see that it's a sushi restaurant. As most of my followers know I am skeptic when it comes to Japanese food outside of the motherland it something told me that we need to check this place out. (Well the previous reviews helped a little). 
there was only a few people at the bar when we arrived. I am not one for the sushi bar so we opted for a booth. Service was fast and friendly; as you would come to expect in a Japanese establishment. 


I glanced at the special board and they had:
O-Toro
Chu-Toto
I knew that we were in for a real Japanese treat!
Here is what we ordered by round:

Round 1
Agaedashi tofu:
Firm toru with a nice fried skin, topped with negi (green onion) just like you would find in the Motherland. 

Negitoro Temaki
Freshly made negitoro, the fish was bright pink and garnished with fresh wasabi.

Round 2
Sirloin steak: 
Served on a hot plate garnished with a grip of onions. Nothing to write home about. I didn't come here for the steak; I came for sushi. 

Negitoro Gyunkan (my fave item):
It's not on the menu but they were happy to make it! Same quality as the temaki roll  

Chu-toro
Probably my favorite grade. Right in the middle of the grades. Quick Japanese lesson: The Chu prefix means mid; so in this case mid grade toro. 
It's not too delicate like O-Toro but not solid like akami (normal grade). 

O-toro:
I am not a big O-Toro fan but figured if it's on they have it, I'm going to eat it. The fish was just as expected nice a buttery. 

Round 3:
Gyoza:
Fresh and handmade! What more can you ask for?

Japanese Lasagna Roll:
I didn't order it; the GF did. I am not a fan of suped up sushi with cream cheese so this was a miss for me. BUT the GF liked it....  

More Negitoro gyunkan

Uni:
You have to be a fan of uni to want to eat it. The uni here was ok.. Sorry I am spoiled from living in Northern Japan where they are known for their sweet fresh uni. It was the sweetest that I've had in the valley so far. 

Akami: 
As mentioned previously; its the bright red tuna that everyone is accustomed to. 
Bright red, soft and fresh! So refreshing after eating so much mediocre frozen Vegas buffet sushi. 


Be sure that you don't com hungry as the aforementioned food will run you easily around $100. BUT TRUST ME, ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY! Some of the freshest fish and most authentic sushi that I've had next to Miko's Izakaya (which I still love too!)

I hope that this review helps legitimize the sushi and experience of Tokyo Boys as well as educate the novice on grades of tuna. 


I put my seal of approval on this place! Eat with confidence."}
{"text":"Amazing place! We ordered so much food and finished it all because it was so authentic and delicious :)"}
{"text":"Just updated from 3(3.5!) to 4 stars. Went back today and had the amaebi nigiri, uni nigiri, and the salmon skin roll. The uni portion was generous, and the salmon skin roll was perfectly crispy (if very small), but I like that they did not overdo it on the rice. 

Still expensive & slow, though..."}
