{"text":"It is unusual to find a food truck such as this one, that serves food that is chef-inspired and whose ingredients are mainly locally-sourced.  Local farms provide their ingredients such as the excellent goat cheese from the Kalm Family Farm in north Phoenix, meats from Double Check Ranch in Winkelman, and organic produce from Rhibafarms in Chandler. Fire-roasting enhances the flavor of some of the ingredients, and some of the ingredients are foraged from the surrounding wilderness - hence the name of this endeavor. You might expect such food to be on the pricey side, but that is not the case here. And since the truck adjoins the patio of The Shop Beer Co., you can complement their tasty, affordable fare with a variety of excellent beers, several of which are produced by the aforementioned brewery. Though lunch/brunch ends at 4 pm, dinner starts at 4 pm and ends relatively late, pretty much in tandem with the brewery they collaborate with."}
{"text":"Ate there for the second time last night. First time I played it safe and got a cheeseburger which comes with fries. That was pretty good so I wanted to try a veggie pot pie but they were out so I got fried chicken on a waffle. Very good. They tweak their menu every week and change a lot every two weeks. Both times I was with a group and I haven't heard anything negative from any of us about the food and service. Definitely more than I expect overall from a food truck."}
{"text":"Fire & Foraged is the food truck right next to The Shop Beer Co, and let me tell you they serve up some great food!  I originally went for the L.G.B.T and met up with some friends on a Sunday to learn that Fire & Forage only offers that at lunch on the weekdays, so on that trip I ordered up some chicken wings.  Those were some of the best wings I have had, they had spices rubbed on them and had a great crispy fry to them and drizzled with bbq sauce, so dang good, also on that visit there was a snack board & hummus to share and those were delish too!  Then I went back during the weekday lunch hours to get that L.G.B.T.. Its bacon, goat cheese, arugula and tomato with mayo on Texas toast. This was an amazing sandwich! I must have it again soon!   Then friends and I went on a Friday night and that time I tried the Chicken and Waffles, and again the chicken was just cooked perfectly, and the waffles too, my only complaint would be not enough syrup, but that's just me, make it messy!  Fire & Foraged so far has banged out some great food and I am a huge fan! Go give them a try!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast burrito if it's available. Made with egg, bacons cheese and  tater tots"}
{"text":"I just had the best breakfast burrito I have ever had!  The staff was friendly, fast and the food was fantastic! I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"3.5/5  We stopped here for lunch on a sunny Friday. The food truck is parked right outside The Shop Beer Co. and there were plenty of seats available on the patio while we were here.  After browsing though the menu I decided on the blackened catfish salad and had a bite of the burger. The meals only took a few minutes to make. I enjoyed the fresh, locally grown, peppery tasting arugula with the catfish and the fish was well seasoned. It wasn't the most tender catfish I've had and it was lukewarm temperature wise but for $6 it was a good deal I thought. The catfish is originally made as a sandwich and I think the dressing on the catfish, while good on a bun, didn't really mesh well in a salad for me.  The burger was decent, nothing really stood out about it, but I do like how it was made with Double Check Ranch grass fed beef.  I'm not sure how ordering beverages works if you are getting a non alcoholic drink for lunch with your meal but I think you just order inside and mention you are getting the lunch special. I had asked several times about the lunch special but did not really get a straight answer about it, nor was I rung up for it when I asked for it, so it's still a mystery to me lol. While the beer lunch special is $2 off your beer with a meal, the non alcoholic special is supposedly $8 for a drink and meal but it is not posted at the food truck. I only found out about it by looking at their website menu. We ended up getting something to drink somewhere else.  The other annoying thing we encountered while eating here was that someone was working on one of the patio benches and making loud drilling sounds the entire time we were here. It sounded like I was eating at a construction site so we ate as quickly as we could and left."}
{"text":"I've been waiting awhile to write this review because I wanted to try a lot of their menu items and make sure they were consistent since they are fairly new but from their tacos to their frog legs to their burgers, you CANNOT go wrong with this place. Their food is delicious utilizing all local fresh ingredients at super affordable prices. Everything is executed perfectly and made with care. If you're in the area, definitely give this place a try you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had the Blackened Cod sandwich with some French fries and it was quite damn good. When I had Fire and Foraged, they were outside the Beer Shop Co--I'm not sure if this is their normal joint, but it was a nice pairing. Also, what must be commented on, is the price. While I love food trucks, more often than not they are priced beyond an amount I am willing to pay or accept as being reasonable. F&F is very reasonably priced. The plate you see pictured here cost $8. To me, that's a good deal in the food truck world. If I ever see Fire and Foraged in the wild again, I will run--NOT WALK--RUN to try them again! You should too!"}
