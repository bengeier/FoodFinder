{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! Perfect for the winter weather. Their hotpot is super light yet filling, I have never been disappointed coming here"}
{"text":"I'm rating this place 5-star because both the food and the service is terrific! It's our first time here and we came for dinner. I'm glad I made a reservation because the place fills up after 7pm! 

We ordered the pork and bean sprouts congbul (min 2 portions), a huge plate of thin sliced pork with a mountain of mung bean sprouts and Korean spicy soybean paste. A server will cook it down for you on the hotplate in the middle of the table. It was delicious. It comes with numerous sides including tasty chilled kimchi and steamed egg. I like their soft, purple rice too. We also ordered a plate of bulgogi for the kids. It was good too. 

Towards the end of our meal, our server came back to ask if we want to make fried rice with our remaining congbul. Of course we would try that! He brought out a plate of purple rice with seasoned dry seaweed mixed in and made fried rice for us. It was again, delicious! 

We'll go back for sure and will also try their shabu shabu."}
{"text":"I am glad i tried this restaurant without even understanding what CONGBUL means.
thanks to other reviewers who wrote interesting reviews.

I tried their seafood and pork congbul, and it was spicy and yummy.  

banchan was not what you get typically but egg soup and salad and seaweed soup made good compliment to the Congbul.

the server made nice fried rice after finishing about half of the Congbul.  Its a must if you ever try Congbul.

price was cheap, but food didn't feel like cheap at all.

I will definitely go back"}

For those of you who love Korean table top cooking style, you will love this restaurant. Shabu & Congbul specialize in Korean table top cooking and Shabu Shabu. Honestly, I don't really care for Korean Hot Pot so there was no doubt I wanted to try CongBul. CongBul is a short term for Cong-Na-Mul (beansprout) & Bul-Go-Gi (Korean BBQ) and I ordered OhSamCongBul which comes with Squid, Pork and Bean Sprout

It is unfortunately minimum 2 order for this specific dish so make sure to go with a friend or be prepared to stuff your face. They have difference price for lunch and dinner so keep that in mind plus you can order regular or extra spicy.

I went with 2 friends and we order 3 servings of CongBul, regular spicy and it comes with the main dish, steamed egg soup, seaweed soup, 3 side dishes and rice. The main dish consists of squid, thinly sliced pork, rice cake, beansprout and other veggies.

My friends and I love meat so we decided to add on 2 sides of sliced pork and 1 side of rice cake on top of everything.

I personally don't really like seaweed soup to begin with but their seaweed soup tasted a little too instant for me but it was nice to have some mild soup since the main dish does get pretty spicy

Steamed egg soup is a nice palette cleanser in between to give your mouth some rest from spicy food

Everything comes in a flat square pan uncooked and the servers will help you- Pork is sliced very thin so it does cook pretty fast

Just like every Korean table top cooking, you can order rice at the end and they will make fried rice for you with the left over sauce.

The rice comes with seaweed, kimchi and sesame oil and they will cook it for you

Summary: Another Korean table top cooking restaurant for you to try if you like Joons. It is not a large restaurant and it does fill up during dinner time so make sure to get there early. The restaurant is hidden inside the plaza North of Steeles so watch out for it if you decide to drop by."}
{"text":"I LOVE SHABU CONGBUL. The thing you have to eat here is the congbul. It is perfect and when you are finished you can ask for rice with kimchi and the result is soooo nice. It has egg and sea soup, salad, spicy pork, bean sprouts and rice. It is one of my favorite meals I discoverer in Toronto. Totally recommended."}
{"text":"3.5 
Foods ok but pork has lots and lots of fat. That's why the fried rice at the end tastes so good. 
Parking is good in this plaza."}
{"text":"Both the Shabu and the Congbul are great. I love eating at this place - meat, rice cake, pumpkin, cooked egg, noodles and the congee... yum. The food isn't greasy for a Korean place either. Everything comes with lots of veggies, so it's healthy."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the pork tabletop combo. So it's basically a hot plate with pork slices, bean sprouts, and other small flavourings. The side dishes are the typical ones you get at your average korean restaurants. In addition, this place gave us a seaweed soup, which was nice and bland that balanced the heavier taste from the pork. Also, there was a nice lettuce salad that helped balance everything too.

Our waiter cooked everything for us so all we needed to do was to eat. After we were done about about 60% of the dish, my friend ordered rice and the waiter added the rice into the remaining contents of the hot plate and made it into a korean fried rice dish. 

Overall, this may not be the most healthy meal, but it was definitely filling (mmm carbs...). It is also pretty good and cost friendly. Everything was $20 ish (lunch prices), which was shared by my friend and I. I would come here again and try their other items if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love trying out new foods. Just when I thought I had tried everything Korean food has to offer, I find this place. 

Shabu means Shabu Shabu (or hot pot). Congbul () means bean sprout cooking. Shabu Shabu is not hard to find in the GTA, but this is the ONLY place to get Congbul so that's what we got. Looking at what other tables got, we were pretty happy we found this place. 

Congbul is basically lots of bean sprouts+ your choice of toppings. You can have bean sprouts + pork, or bean sprouts + seafood. We went with the pork. When the order comes, you'll notice that it looks really big, but don't worry, bean sprout is mostly made of water. It'll shrink as it gets cooked. If you don't know how to cook, don't worry, one of the severs will help you. 

In terms of taste, this is a spicy dish (looks red). I like it. Price wise, it was about $10 per serving + tax and tip so it ended up under $30 for 2 people. Pretty good as we were full afterwards. The best part is that this is a very healthy way of cooking. Bean sprouts are healthy and you're cooking without oil. 

I looked at their menu. If you want more mainstream Korean foods like stone pot rice or cold noodles, they have those too. But if you come to this place for the first time, I insist that you try congbul as it's the ONLY restaurant I know that serves this."}
{"text":"Really fresh and authentic food. The BBQ was different than anything I've had. We cooked the meat and vegetables in a big bowl of vegetable broth which gave the broth a nice flavour at the end. The server didn't speak English very well but was very friendly."}
{"text":"Trying Congbul for the first time, I didn't really know what to expect. Thought the price per person was a little expensive, but could see why, due to the laborious table side cooking required by the sever.

That said I thought it was delicious and light. Just the perfect portion. Did not notice much smoke or clothing smelling like what we ate.

Service was decent and wouldn't mind going back."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for five. Nice to see that they put a sign on our table and actually sectioned it off as being reserved. Had the pork and sprouts congbul, the beef shabu shabu, and the haemul pajeon (seafood pancake). 

The shabu shabu was very much about the purest flavor of the ingredients. There was scant other seasoning going on. The beef from the shabu shabu had next to no marbling, so that was disappointing, and when it cooked down, each piece of beef was quite small, so if you're insistent upon getting the shabu shabu, you might want to think about how much meat you're getting, and if you're into beef, order a few extra orders of it. That being said, I thought it was cool how you get noodles to put in your broth after you've cooked everything in it, and then after the noodles, you get a rice and seasoning put into your broth and it turns into congee/rice porridge. Waste not, want not. The congee was the best part of the shabu shabu. 

However, I preferred the congbul to the shabu shabu, as the congbul was more flavorful than the shabu shabu. The congbul was like eating spicy fried rice sans rice. Then it really became spicy fried rice because the servers helped us add the rice to our dish. Tasty, but I'm pretty sure I can make this at home. Well, at least a good enough substitution that I wouldn't necessarily need to eat out for it. However, it was a lovely experience to have, and I wouldn't mind doing it again. Price to portion-wise, I think the congbul is also a better deal than the shabu shabu.

The haemul pajeon was around $17, if I recall correctly. It was of a decent size, and there was a good amount of seafood mix in it. It was quite tasty. It was crispy on the outside, and almost gooey on the inside. We all enjoyed it. It's not the cheapest haemul pajeon around, but it's also not the most expensive. I would rather order this than the shabu shabu.

The congbul and/or the shabu shabu was served with steamed egg (I'm a sucker for Korean steamed egg, and it was very good here), seaweed soup, and four side dishes. There was a coleslaw my brother really enjoyed, a seaweed dish with spicy sauce, cabbage kimchi, and something like cabbage slices and cucumbers in some kind of soy sauce. Other than the steamed egg, the rest of the side dishes did not impress me particularly, but they were also not off-putting. 

Two portions of each of the congbul and the shabu shabu and one order of the haemul pajeon was just enough to feed 5 adults, with a little bit of leftover for breakfast for the next day. I might be back with friends so they can try out the congbul. If not, it's because I'm exploring all the other Korean restaurants around the area."}
{"text":"Yum! Would have never found out about this hidden little restaurant if not for my Korean friend recommending the authentic congbul here.

To be honest I didn't know what congbul was until yesterday but it was delicious! We ordered the pork & bean sprout congbul which is essentially a mountain of bean sprouts with rolled up thin pork slices and rice cakes all mixed with their in house spicy sauce on a hot plate. Perfect amount for 2 people. Best part about this is that they have someone cooking it on the plate for you so no worries about scalding hot oil or ruining your new shirt.

The combo also comes with appetizers, seaweed soup, steamed egg and purple rice at the end to fry up in on the hot plate with the remaining congbul sauce. The seaweed they use here in their apps and soup is so silky smooth and the steamed egg was such a bonus. I was stuufffffed.

All that food I ate + beer was only $20 per person! Definitely bang for your buck ladies and gents."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of hot pot, you will love this restaurant. Their broth is much clearer and they provide you with a plate of vegetables & meat to dip in the broth in. They also have Korean side dishes which were delicious. However my favourite part of the meal was when they took the broth you cooked your meats & vegetables in and made a congee with it. The flavours from the meal were absorbed into the rice -- yes, I was super full and yes I finished my bowl of congee. The service is friendly, the price is super affordable and an overall fun experience."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant for a couple times within a month with my different friends.  We've tried both shabu shabu and congbul! 

I can't take spicy foods, so congbul is not my number 1 choice.

Really love their shabu shabu~  after finish all the beefs and vegetables, followed with noodles, and then congee~ Congee is the best, as it has all the favours from the beginning :-D

This is a very busy restaurant, however, their waiters / waitress try their best to serve everyone in the restaurant.  It'll be a better experience if they can hire one or two person to help during the prime time!"}
{"text":"This place is great. All good. Look at the pics. There was lots of food. The appys were great too. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My mom and I shared a baby octopus kong-bul for lunch and everything, including banchan, here was so shockingly salty.  Even the complimentary seaweed soup made me gag after the first sip because it just tasted like warm salty water.  

Their banchans were ho hum and the main dish of baby octopus kong bul was not something I would return for.  The spicy sauce was, again, just on the salty side without much flavour and quite frankly, stir-frying a bunch of vegetable with seafood and meat on tabletop is not some ground-breaking concept that I'm willing to travel the distance or pay additional $$s for. 

Not including the extra 2 liters of water I had to guzzle after this lunch, there was nothing healthful about this meal for you."}
{"text":"I was craving traditional Korean spicy beef stew and bimbimbup, but it is not what I got. Sure the ingredients are essentially the same, but the taste was different. It was still tasty but didn't satisfy my craving for Korean food. Nonetheless, the service was good."}
{"text":"Um...no.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing - off their a la carte menu, as opposed to shabu (hot pot) - but this place was just alright for me.

Firstly, I ordered the Spicy Beef Soup - they didn't have PBS.  And instead of brisket cut beef, there were less than a dozen slices of bulgogi beef.  Thank you for cheapenin' out, but I know the difference!

The rest of the soup was literally less than a few slices of black mushroom, a few slices of onion, and bam...bean sprouts.  It was pretty spicy, but watery, tasty, but $9.99 for a cheaper cut of meat and bean sprouts?  No, I don't think so.

Also ordered the bulgogi with rice and that was ok.

They wrote $12.99 for the Spicy Beef Soup on the receipt, said it was a mistake, and apologised, so I can only go on their word.  So watch your receipt!

Just ok, maybe better for \"shabu\", but their specialty seem to consist of a whack loada bean sprouts + a few slices of shabu shabu meat + spicy sauce.  Not much options if you don't do the cooking at the table."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I came here for table top cooking experience with my family of four. We entered the restaurant and could immediately tell by the smell that the food was going to be delicious, but also that our clothes were also going to bring back a scent of our visit. There were numerous ceiling ventilation units, but none of which seemed to be on or working, strange...

We had a look through the menu but we already knew what we wanted, the Congbul! It's really affordably priced at $11.99 per person. While we were looking through the menu, a table for five (who were Korean) were seated next to us. We placed our order before they did. But somehow, their side dishes arrived at their table already. Still waiting on our side dishes to arrive, the table next to us, their table top entree was brought to them before ours. They had a nice pot of raw ingredients and started grilling away. From time to time I noticed the server assisted with their table top cooking.

Maybe 5-10 minutes later, we see another server come by and she delivers to our table all our side dishes, egg souffle, rice, seaweed soup. It was a lot on the table, it could barely fit really. Three minutes later, another server comes and delivers to our table a large casserole of congbul and places it on the gas stove, (but does not turn it on), and she said, it was ready to eat. I felt very confused that we were served an already cooked congbul. I came here because I wanted to experience slow cooking my meal, seeing it from raw to cooked, and for it to remain sizzling hot. I felt is was unnecessary to bring out the casserole pot if we were not going to turn the gas stove on... Why not just serve it on a plate?  Looking left, right and centre, everyone else in the restaurant who ordered table top cooking had the ingredients served to their table and they were able to cook it. As well, I was pretty peeved as the guests sitting next to us who got their order before us (and were Korean), got to experience the table top cooking...everyone at their table was fricken sweating and peeling their clothes off and wiping themselves because of their hot ass food. 

Don't get me wrong, our food was delicious and very plentiful... but it was not hot to the very end. The food was pretty much luke warm/room temperature. At the end I wanted to make kimchi fried rice. So I asked the server to add 2 more bowls of rice (additional charge of $2.00/bowl) and make for us kimchi fried rice. She was nice enough to do that for us. The gas stove was turned on and she started mixing the rice with our left over congbul in the casserole pot. It was good, food was hot again. I don't know, maybe it was a busy day for them or something, but I definitely felt my table was treated differently than Korean customers, and how our congbul was served was just plain wrong. Personally I would have liked to be treated equally as their Korean customers."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.

Congbul ($14.99 per person, minimum 2 orders)
I believe it was $13.99 for the regular option with sliced pork, bean sprouts, rice cakes, and green onion, but if you added $1 more you can have squid added. So why not! The rice cakes were cut into small pieces, not the usual long length so I would think there weren't much in the mix. I do love the fact that it was loaded with bean sprouts though, lots of veggies! Flavors were ok, not too strong in my opinion. Order comes with a variety of side dishes, seaweed soup, and egg soufflé soup (which was really good btw!), and rice.

Seafood Pancake ($19.99)
This seemed to be a popular item that most people ordered so we decided to give it a try. Quite expensive, but it did have a lot of seafood ingredients - shrimp, squid, lots of onions. The ends were slightly crispy so that was nice, would have been better if the whole pancakes was crispy. I like how there was a lot of ingredients, the ingredients and batter ratio was well balanced.  Lacked a bit of flavor in my opinion. Normally it should come with some kind of soy sauce to dip in but this place they didn't serve any. 

Food was ok, good for groups. I would come back to try their Shabu and rice porridge."}
{"text":"Shabu & Congbul? 

The name of this Korean Restaurant making me a little worry... 

I am not sure what is Congbul? And I know most place would not have serve me Shabu Shabu if I dine alone..since most of the places I went you need to order at least 2 portions...

Congbul is a mixture of vegetables especially bean sprouts, pork or squid, served on a flat iron plate.. mixed with noodles and rice? Sadly you need to order at least 2 portions.. so I just watch others eating that or a Shabu Shabu, while I slurping on 

Korean Seafood Noodle ($6.99)
- Extra Spicy Please... the waiter asked me twice if I am sure... Yes Please
- The menu said it is \"Home Made\" Noodle... but did they make it here? or they get in from somewhere... the noodle is surprising cooked al dente with a great bite!
- The broth was spiced with Thai Chili... and this really reminds me of Tom Yum Soup with a little sourness
- Squid, Shrimp, Bay Scallops and mussels, the squids tasted the best!

The banchan is a little disappointing! They don't even give me any Kimchi??! No Kimchi in a Korean Restaurant?!!!

Lunch Specials for their Shabu and Congbul. Most of the other items starts from $6.99... pricing are quite reasonable. 

They accepts Visa and Master Card."}
