{"text":"Found this place while browsing for quick bite near my place.  I could easily bypassed it as the sign is not very visible.  The food here is mediocre in comparison with other two places across the street.  They use sauerkraut as one of the ingredient for some stewed items so the flavour is toward hot and sour, but not my favour.  The price is reasonable but so are couple of other places across the street.  The service is inconsistent as during my first visit the waiter was really friendly and shown initiative by asking me whether I want more sides.  Another time around another waiter pretty much disappeared after taking the order.  Overall impression is that this place is ok for quick bite but not a place to sit here for long.  Overall 2.5/5"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place isn't more popular.  For around $25 dollars, you get:  A huge serving of Kamjatang (pork bone soup) that's loaded with meat, and the perfect level of spicy.  If you've ever had good spicy red broth, deep is the way I would describe it  It's the kind of spicy that'll make your upper lip moist with sweat, but you won't be reaching for the ice water to turn the heat down.  A big plate of Dokbokki, with fresh and chewy rice cakes, savory fish cakes, and covered in more delicious red sauce.    A dozen (give or take) fried mandu that are always freshly fried and golden brown.  I can take these bad boys home and they'll still be crispy from the commute.  I usually get my food to go, and make a stop at Hodo Kwaja for some walnut cakes for desert, and maybe stop by P.A.T. for some juice and beverages.  If you're a fan of red sauce, I can't recommend Umji enough.  It's great food at a great price, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"If you don't know about this little gem in Korea town, you're seriously missing out.   A little background history:  The male cook they have in the evenings used to own Angel's. This was a tiny street food vendor ish place on the corner of Bloor and Manning. They were famous for their cheap prices and abundance of food. For whatever reason he ended up at Umji and I am forever grateful.   Had their goat soap, which is absolutely fantastic. The same goat soup is $14 at Im Ga Nae down the street. Here it's $8.95. The taste is flavorful, they add a decent amount of veggies and it isn't salty at all! The side dishes are a bit underwhelming but I'd rather that. There's an old saying, where if your main is the focus then the side dishes need to be somewhat \"boring\" for a lack of a better word. The side dishes can't take away from the main!  My buddy got her usual, army base soup, but in individual portion sizes. Army base soup is usually served for two only and comes in this huge pan dish where I can never finish it.   Their kimchi is spicy and made fresh. Their radish is fermented out of its mind, as it should be. I rarely eat kimchi outside of the home but here I will!   So as long as he is cooking in their kitchen I will remain a loyal customer to him to the end. Broke my heart to hear he started at 7 pm to end at 2 am."}
{"text":"This is one of the best low-key korean restaurants I have been to. Their side dishes are very flavourful, especially their radishes and potatoes! Their \"Yummy\" I believe is their signature dish; sweet and spicy meat that falls right off the bone, coupled with rice. Their pork bone soup meat is just like their Yummy, extremely tender meat with flavourful soup.   It's sad to say that they are moving uptown... I loved the convenience and their modest appearance as a korean restaurant that offers high quality dishes. Their wait staff is very friendly and polite, which makes the overall experience similar to eating a home cooked meal.   I would have to travel uptown to enjoy their dishes, but I would gladly do so."}
{"text":"When you first walk into Umji (in English, Thumbs Up), you don't really expect much. The interior and exterior decorating is a little underwhelming- just very simple, even a little run-down looking. However, you're greeted by a cute and friendly Korean family and you're either seated by a young man or a middle aged woman (so probably a mom/aunt with her son?) and you get a feel that it's a family run business. The restaurant instantly feels cozy and intimate, haha. The food was incredible and inexpensive- had the pork bone soup and the side dishes were one of the best I've ever had anywhere. I'm a Korean food fanatic so this is saying a lot. Would definitely recommend and try again :)"}
{"text":"I Went to this restaurant on a Monday night, very quiet. The place was casual but roomy. so you will not feel cramped. The service at the place was efficent and the food did not take too long to come.   Now here comes the most important part. The Food! I ordered a Chicken Katsu, and the person with me ordered a Beef Soup. We shared a little bit of both, the taste of the food was not bad, although i would say it really doesn't stand out , among other Korean Resaurant in toronto.   I find that the Chicken Katsu, was nothing special., it was a little dry inside the chicken. The Beef soup which i had a chance to try, was below average, as it didn't have a very strong flavour to it, much like many of the restaurants that i've been to around yonge and finch.   The side dishes, were a little disappointing, most of the korean restaurants today, has at least 1 signature side dish, or 1 which they are exceptionally good at. i find there really isn't one here that stands out.   The price at this place i find is a little pricey, even for Korean food. I figured they were capitalizing on the fact that they are literally the only korean restaurant around the local area. which is why they charge those prices.  the Soup and basic bimbimbap is fair in price, but once you get into actual dishes like the korean style sweet and sour chicken, it costs something like 17.95 before tax.   If a person has a craving for korean food, and live in the area who doesn't want to drive all the way to Yonge and Finch, i find this restaurant is serviceable. Otherwise i would make the trip to Yonge and finch and go to the restaurants that specialize  in the particular dish that you like."}
{"text":"I can't believe there aren't more reviews on this little nook on the corner of Bloor St and Palmerston Boulevard :-o I was on my to a free movie screen in Christie Pits Park on a Sunday evening. Having arrived way early than the scheduled screening I decided to explore the area abit. I always forget that this area is the base for the city's Korea Town so when happening upon numerous restaurants with 'hangul' signs on them I decided to find a good place to fulfill my hunger pangs, some spot that wasn't too packed and where a lone diner could get his fill of Korean cuisine.   So after cruising east along bloor street for such a place, I came across Umji.  When I went the server greeted me and had me choose a spot to sit and gave me a menu and also a piece of paper with names of the dishes listed on it. You just enter the number of servings you want for each item in the square space beside each dish and once the server notices that you are done with your selection he will come and take the paper. Prices were also reasonable for most of the single person dishes, under $10, while the dishes that served more than two people were over $15.  Each item on the menu is accompanied by a helpful picture of what the actual dish looks like. I selected the Pork Kimchi Chigae which also includes chunks of soft tofu. And I presume true to korean eating customs, the dish comes accompanied by a bowl of rice and four different 'banchan' side dishes; in my case for that day: kimchi, coleslaw, fried sweetened tofu strips and potato dish. The chigae had a good ratio of meat, kimchi and tofu and the soup in which they were cooked was quite spicy which would be more soothing in winter. I found myself sniffling and taking out my tissue after a couple of spoonfuls of the spicy soup, and the spiciness was also present in the cooked items and I had to eat some of it with the rice. I think you are also allowed to ask for a second refill of your banchan as I decided to follow the lead of the diners at the table beside me, and I got enjoy a second plate of the tasty potatoes :-D Well, since I had been craving a good korean meal in awhile, this was soothing, comfort food at its best, and it would really hit the spot and warm up anyone on a winter's day. I'll be back to try out the other dishes once the temperature starts to get lower. The meal was so filling that I never really went for the snacks that I took along to the movie."}
{"text":"I love their beef bulgogi and pork bone soup!!! Small but decent place. Always busy.. Friendly staff"}
