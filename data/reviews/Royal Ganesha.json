{"text":"So last night I ordered 60 dollars worth of takeout and they didn't give me a receipt and forgot the cucumber salad. The butter chicken I had was so watered down and runny like soup, the aloo gobi I also ordered was covered in green mush and there was two califlower and potatoes were so mushy, saffron rice wasn't anything special it tasted like it's been a couple days old not fresh, and the rice pudding was like soup ! Barely any rice. Overall very disappointed. There are better Indian restaurants to order from"}
{"text":"The food is terrible, there are much better Indian restaurants in the area. Being Indian dont waste your time trying this one. The butter chicken is runny and there is no flavor. The buffet is also not worth it at all. The portions are tiny for the amount you pay. I eat Indian food at least twice a week and will never go back to this one!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great portions for the price. Mango lassi was great. Service is friendly. Odd policy of paying before the meal. They've probably had a bunch of people skip out on the bill, so understandable. Butter chicken was more like (delicious) tomato chicken. Beef samosa was really yummy. We got butter chicken, rice, naan and could have fed three. Will come back."}
{"text":"Went here with friends in search of good Indian for dinner. It was so good and convenient to get to from the hotel. The Lamb Korma was delicious with enough spice to make it interesting. Personally, I could have had a bit more spice, but when trying a new place, and not knowing the spice levels, I tend to be a bit conservative. Next time, I'll up the ante! Definitely worth it, and I would go back for more. If I lived in Calgary, I could see myself becoming a regular patron!  The service was great and menu suggestions were spot on!"}
{"text":"Ordered online. The prices were good, and it was classic Indian food. There were plenty of vegetarian options. I would order from there again."}
{"text":"As a man working there said.. \"We cook for quality not quantity\" and he was right! The best Indian food I have tried in Calgary."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet. Everything fresh and delicious. Great place to come if you're hungry."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The service was amazing and the food was some of the best I've had. I also had my 1 year daughter and our server was super sweet with her and gave her rice pudding and a little gift. I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Royal Ganesha is housed in the house that used to be Anju on 10 St. S.W. Being part of the Calgary Opera Chorus for Lakme we had a 2 hour dinner break between afternoon and evening rehearsals on a Saturday night. They don't normally do dinner buffets but when I explained I had 20 people wanting East Indian food (Lakme, the opera, is set in 19th Century India under British rule), they very obligingly agreed to have one just for us. We took over the main floor of the restaurant. Service was excellent. The food was decent and I highly recommend the onion bhajia (onion fritters) and chicken pakora. We had butter chicken, beef curry, vegetable korma, dal makhani and vegetable biriyani as well as salad, papadam and a chutney, butter naan and rice and rice pudding for $24.99. The curry and butter chicken was a little on the watery side but the flavours were good, the sauces could have been thicker. A selection of house wines could be had for $5.95 per glass. Parking is on the street. It is a small place so definitely reservations are recommended on the weekend. The naan is scrumptious, crisply baked in the tandoori and still soft and pliable to dip in the sauces. They have one of the best rice puddings I've tasted, not too sweet or overly scented with cardamom."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It's in a unique space with good parking nearby, plus it's close to Kensington and the train, so it's vey easy to get to. Our office staff often goes for the lunch buffet and the food is excellent. The service is even better however- I absolutely love that they tell us what each dish is about, where it comes from in India, and what ingredients are in it. In addition, the staff are thoughtful and kind, and very friendly! Check it out- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Was here about two weeks ago, and in going back in an hour...the food was amazing! The host/owner/manager was most accommodating and super friendly. The atmosphere is also very Indian and quite lovely. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Impressed with their service.    Had to book some out of province catering for a client in Calgary, so they were prepared to do name labelling of the dishes, companies like that.  Heck, even residential orders too, who likes rummaging through all the bags and guessing what's what lol.  They do deliver in DT.  and speak good English."}
{"text":"Are you ready Calgary?   I live on the same block as the infamous Anju and much to my disappointment I noticed that they were closing down.  In the weeks to follow I started seeing movement in the place only to see another restaurant was going to take Anju's place.  Much to my delight it was Indian food.  The day that Royal Gensha opened its doors to the public, some friends and I were there with huge bells on!  RG offers a very affordable lunch buffet at 8.99 for meat and 7.99 for vegetarian.  But get there fast because only two weeks after opening its doors RG already has line ups!!!  I have been an avid foodie and have written many yelp restuarant reviews as you can see and I honestly can say that this is the BEST Indian food I have ever had in Calgary.  The dishes change daily and they use the most freshest ingrediants.  The choices are vast, lamb, beef, spinach, chicken ,lentil , chickpea and the mango lassos are to die for.  The nicest thing is the family that own it are very very nice and hardworking folks and go out of thier way to make you feel very welcome.  There are only 8 -10 tables open for now but as soon as the upstairs opens up you can bet that Royal Ganesha will be packed to the rim.  Thier curries have extra flavour and the rice pudding is superb.. not too sweet and sprinkled with chopped pistacios and nuts with a delicious hint of cardamon.  I highly recommend this new gem!  You work during the day .. don't despair they are also open for dinner...."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. Me and my buddy went on sunday evening.  First of all the service is very poor, no one was around to even ask for water after the food was served. The malai kofta was uncooked and garlic naan was burnt. We had to wait for 15 mins for someone to come and ask us if everything was ok.   They killed my apatite and when we were finished we had to go downstairs to notify them ... Damm you!! oh we are done eating, would you pack us the curry and give us the bill...  No sorry, no nothing..."}
