{"text":"For a quick slice or a giant NY style pizza this a a good option. If you are from NY you probably will argue that there are better options but for Old Town AZ good quick pizza option."}
{"text":"Worst experience with this restaurant and even spoke with the owner. In short my pizza never got delivered to my hotel at the royal palms. Owner claimed the pizza delivery guy dropped off the pizza and wings at the front desk of the hotel. Went to the front desk and if they received the pizza they said they would have brought it to my room .  So the ball was dropped somewhere here. Regardless, I'm disputing the charge so good luck and you lost a customer for life. I called Gus pizza next door and spent $50.00 with them instead . I highly recommend Gus pizza!"}
{"text":"Update: F these guys. Seriously, F these guys straight to hell.    ***NOTE THE MULTIPLE POOR REVIEWS***  Sunday 9/17/17 to explain our food was delivered late, cold and the order was wrong. The manager displayed poor attitude when I called in regarding these issues saying \"what do you want me to do about it?\"   I even reached out to their \"corporate offices\" which is jut a call center that takes messages which they tell you \"will be returned with a phone call between 11 pm and 1 am during the week\"  It's no wonder they're located directly across the street from the busiest bars in Scottsdale because you'd have to be wasted to accept terrible service like this.                        *****PLEASE DO NOT CONTINUE TO FUND THIS BUSINESS*****"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Joe's pizza!!! We frequently order delivery and the pizza always arrives hot. The pies are as close as you'll get to east coast comfort pizza. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best pizza in Arizona. Not only is there pizza good but wings and everything else. I will drive 30 miles to just have there pizza"}
{"text":"Worst service ever they got my order wrong and then tried to charge me for my right order with out refunding the wrong order. I'm at work and can't leave and they refuse to deliver my right order and want me to re pay..."}
