{"text":"This place is great, best breakfast and best hamburger in town. The mannequin needs updating though..."}
{"text":"A MUST BRUNCH PLACE. Second time here and even though there always is a line, it is worth the wait! First time was brutal because it was day after NYE. The variety of eggs benedict is awesome as well as the crepes. I love that they serve fruit on skewers!
The menu is only in French btw. Make sure you check out the graffiti bathrooms!"}
{"text":"amazing eggs benedict. their inside decor is interesting & please be prepared for their bathroom - very cool stuff. line up is long but for two people it was easier to get in."}
{"text":"Favorite place from our visit in Montreal. Funky place, welcoming and fun staff, and most importantly delicious brunch food"}
{"text":"New Yorkers in Montreal... Love this place!!! Fried calamari is amazing. Portions are HUGE. Poutine Classic is amazing. =) thumbs up"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict with Chorizo very tasty so much you will not want anything else all day, coffee good, juice fresh squeezed, service is good, restaurant is a bit crowded. You have got check out the washrooms. All in all as good a brunch as you will get anywhere."}
{"text":"toujoursa très bon! J'adore les portions et l'ambiance. Les serveurs sont attentionnés et agréable"}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE! My friend and I went on a Sunday morning at 9:30, and there was already a ~30 minute wait. Once we sat down, the tables are close together, but the restaurant has a great, upbeat atmosphere, and it's fantastically decorated. Our server was wonderful - friendly, and engaging, despite how busy it was. Throughout the meal, he was very attentive. 

We ordered the mango, pineapple, lychee smoothie and it is so refreshing and not too sweet. The smoothies are huge, so plan to share :) Once we placed our order, they brought over fruit kebabs, which were a great appetizer, especially while we waited for the food. We ordered 2 eggs Benedict - the smoked meat one and the duck confit one, and both were delightful. The smoked meat was savory, but not the most incredible smoked meat I've had in Montreal. The duck confit was delicious, but the caramelized onions did make the dish sweeter than I expected. However overall, these are some of the best eggs Benedict I've ever had with incredible and ample hollandaise, and perfectly poached eggs. The roasted potatoes are full of flavor!

If I lived in Montreal, I would definitely make this a regular weekend spot. I can see why people are willing to line up for it! Also, be sure to check out the bathroom!"}
{"text":"Very long wait, but extremely worth it. Staff was pleasant and helpful with the large menu. We ordered way too much food because we wanted to try it. The coffee is fantastic, the eggs benny is awesome, and the pancakes were inventive and delicious. The perfectly ripe fresh fruit started the meal and the infused water was a nice touch. The fun atmosphere, happy people, and great food will have me definitely visit again if I'm ever up there again."}
{"text":"yum, yum, yum

Can't do brunch there all the time as I would weigh 1000lbs but it's our go to place for when people are in town.  Even though you have to get there early, it's totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were very excited to check out this highly reviewed breakfast joint, but were sorely disappointed by the rude service. After waiting in line for nearly an hour, we reached the front only to have one of the waiters pull a girl and her friend out of the line and into the restaurant, seating them in front of people who had been waiting for ages. When confronted with the blatantly unfair treatment of the other customers, the waiter was unapologetic and attempted to explain his behavior by stating that the woman was his girlfriend. Girlfriend or not, skipping the line is simply bad business, and unfortunately, we won't be eating somewhere that treats it patrons with such blatant disregard."}
{"text":"Bonne nourriture, bon choix mais , hélas, pas de menu anglais. Il faut demander à la serveuse de traduire !!!!! Pensez- vous que les serveuses (belles et sexy) ont le temps de traduire les pages de ce menu, long et compliqué, même en français???? Vous avez compris: pas une situation confortable pour le client anglophone, qui manque le plaisir de choisir et se sent rushé, car, bien sûr, la serveuse a des tonnes de gens à servir etc...

Good food, good choice however, be warned that there is no english menu! No trouble, says theowner, the waitress will translate for each client.....wow.
The poor girl, however cute and willing,  has about thirty seconds to give you and the other english blokes, cauz, of course, she is extremely busy serving twenty other clients!!!!! So the fun of browsing through the tea list, the coffee sorts, the complicated combis is replaced by time-stress. Breathe through the nose. It´ll be fine."}
{"text":"We were here for the Canadian Grand Prix. Best brunch ever. Price fits the copious amounts of delicious food served. Ordered various egg benedictines concoctions. The juice cocktails are made for two or three people. Coffee is lacking (espresso tasted burnt and traditional coffee was weak).  Servers were extraordinarily friendly.  Glow in the dark bathroom came in third as my favorite part of the visit. Came here two days in a row on a weekend.  The line was worth the wait. Get there before 9:30am on weekends or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Flavourful, rich and generous portion of eggs Benedict. We had the mushroom topping and the crab cake ones. Probably could've shared one of the eggs Benedict and a fruit salad for two people!
They make good coffee and the water has watermelon in it! Original idea and a sweet little taste. 
Reasonable price. Do expect to wait quite a while (30mins-1h) during peak brunch hours... worth it though!"}
{"text":"Best salmon tartare! Full portion with a cosmopolitan for supper!

Fun ambiance! Nice servers, very nice setting!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good breakfast place and Yelp recommended this place in Montreal.  I must say overall I was impressed with the food.  I went there on a Tuesday morning for breakfast so it wasn't that busy (though it did get busy at lunch time when we were getting ready to leave).  Based on other reviews I understand there can be quite a wait though depending on when you go so be prepared.

Their brunch menu offered a nice selection of dishes.  I ordered the chorizo 2 which is eggs benedict done with chorizo sausage served with homemade potatoes.  Overall this dish was very well done.  My companion had something similar and thought it was quite tasty as well.  I will say the hollandaise sauce was quite rich however, too rich for my blood.  I am sure that meal had well over 2000 calories and half of them was in the hollandaise sauce alone.  I wish they had gone a little lighter on the sauce but the meal was still quite enjoyable.

The reason they lose a star is for the terrible service.  I'm from Ottawa originally and I'm visiting Montreal and I do understand that people are a bit more 'trendy' in Montreal but I could not get the look the staff were going for.  The only term I can use to describe the staff that work there are 'ignorant hipsters who don't care about their patrons'.  The attire of the male staff working there was something an angry emo teenager would wear.  Our waiter was rude and no where to be found most of the time.  I had to flag other staff down just to get a refill on coffee, to get the bill etc.  The menu is French only and I think in this day and age having an English menu is a must for most places in Montreal.

I did not care for the ambiance at all.  They try very hard to be trendy but in my opinion in just comes off as tacky.  The music was also extremely loud making it difficult to hear anybody trying to speak.  The price-to-quality ratio at L'avenue is good and at the end of the day is the most important thing for me.  If you can look beyond the tackiness of this place and the poor service, the food is quite good here."}
{"text":"My first meal in Montreal was lunch at L'Avenue. As an Australian, I'm used to pretty top notch brunches and this place definitely trumps a lot of so-called best brunch places around the US.  Portions were excessive, and I did appreciate the fruit skewer as a starter. The meal was flavourful without being in your face salty, although admittedly I did order a French toast benny which leaned towards the greasy side. During this meal, I had the fortune or misfortune (depending on how you view it) of finding a hair in my food. The waiter was notified and my lunch was given to me on the house no questions asked. Needless to say service was as it should be."}
{"text":"We got here just in time to beat the crowd lining up out the door. The waitstaff never let our coffee cups stay empty, and the portions were HUGE. The service was on top of it, even as busy as it was."}
{"text":"I would give it a 3.5 if I could. I went yesterday with my friend for my birthday. We waited around 40 mins which is not too bad given it was a sunday afternoon. I love their watermelon infused water and their baked potatoes taste amazing, but other than that, it is not as amazing as others said. I ordered the steak and egg benedict, too much sauce poured on it and way too greasy. I usually love rich and heavy food, but the sauce doesn't go well with the steak and mushroom. My friend ordered \"gym dude\" omelette. It's okay but a little bit watery. The salad dressing is too oily, but taste good. For the portion, I'd say it's okay. At least you can't share one dish between two unless you eat like a bird. I finished mine without problem, and also tried my friend's omelette, salad, and a slice of bread, yet not feeling full. As breakfast, it may be a bit too much, but as lunch, very reasonable portion. Overall, great service and ambiance. Food is good, but not worth waiting for over 30 mins."}
{"text":"Great brunch with amazing taste and presentation! No wonder there's a line up all the time... And the waiters are so cute :)))"}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch place in Montreal. This place makes the best potatoes and their duck Benedict is a must try. Overall a great experience and you should check the art in their washrooms, sick!!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfectly cooked. I'll visit Montreal again for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Plan for some extra time as there is often a wait.

Coffee is decent, Chocolate milkshake is great!

Eggs Benedict Sucre Sale as well as the Steak and Eggs Benedict were both awesome.

Bon Ben is a big breakfast, components were good but is your typical breakfast.  Beans are served in an All-Clad measuring cup.

Baguette as part of the Bon Ben is a good choice (as opposed to typical toast)."}
{"text":"The burger was amazing. A really cool place with a great vibe. No vegan options and only a handful of vegetarian options (the veggie eggs benedict was great). 
The free fresh fruit, and all the juices are definitely a nice touch."}
{"text":"Première fois à l'Avenue cette semaine passée vers environs 12H00(Je suis habitué à prendre mes brunch/déjeuners dominicaux à un autre endroit sur Sainte Catherine). Il y avait une file d'attente assez longue et on a attendu à peu près 25-30 minutes.

Le décor est assez original et ils ont une grande salle à manger avec des bancs/canapé au long des murs et des tables pour 2/4 personnes au milieu de la salle. La musique était un peu trop fort pour mon goût par contre. 

Attention! Touts les plats sur le menu ne sont pas disponible en tout temps. Il y a des plats qu'on ne peut commander que le soir (par exemple le filet saumon grillé, les steaks etc.) mais ce n'est pas marqué sur le menu ni les serveurs vous l'indiquent.

Nous avons commandé une omelette et une salade saumon/fromage de chèvre. Le temps d'attente c'est au moins 30 minutes. La bouffe était correcte, pas exceptionnelle mais pas dégueulasse non plus. Par contre les portions sont tellement copieuses que nous n'avons pas pu finir nos plats. 

Je vous recommande restaurant l'avenue si vous êtes prêts à attendre une demi heure sur le trottoir à l'extérieur du restaurant et une demi heure à l'intérieur après avoir commandé. 
 
J'y retournerai probablement pas."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. 
Came here for brunch (love brunch!) and was NOT disappointed.  I came here on a weekday around 1pm and waited for about 15 minutes for a table.  I would have waited longer if I had to.  This place oozes of hipster cool (yeah, I said it...), the food is delicious, portions are huge (American portions - for good or for bad, I'll let you decide), extensive menu (in French only) and fast service.  A tattooed mannequin keeps you interested while waiting outside, a graffiti wall greets you inside and a motorcycle overhead reminds you that only cool places have them. 

I would have ordered the latte in a bowl but seeing others with it, I knew I wouldn't be able to have an actual meal with it.  The bowl itself is as large as my head. 

I had the \"Bobby visite l'Espagne\" which was 3 scrambled eggs over a large plate of sauteed chorizo sausages, mushrooms and spinach which was over fried potatoes.  Ah-mazing.  So, so, so good. Albeit heavy (at a place like this, you're silly to expect otherwise) it was delicious.  
Did I mention that it also comes with a fruit skewer & two slices of toast (or a small baguette)? 

My fiance got the Arc et Ciel which was eggs benedict with smoked salmon with a layer of cream cheese (!) and potatoes. Mmm....and this also came with a fruit skewer. 

The food came faster than we expected considering how packed this place was.  Seeing other tables with the other items they ordered made me wish I came here the day before for brunch as well.  The smoothies are gi-normous but look incredibly fresh and delicious. 

I wish I could pack this place up and bring 'em home. 
Love."}
{"text":"I'm a visitor from out of town but was very impressed by this place! They specialize in eggs benedicts, and their menu is only in french, but the waiter was kind enough to translate. My table and I had eggs benedict with smoked meat, steak, and french toast. All three dishes had generous portions and tasted excellent.

The eggs benedict are perfectly done, runny when broken and with a very tasty sauce. The french toast was delicious - light and fluffy, and the corners of it sugar coated. Steak, smoked meats were all delectable as well. 

We lined up for about 30 minutes on a Sunday, which wasn't too bad. Would definitely visit it for brunch if I was in Montreal again."}
{"text":"We love L'Avenue the food staff and atmosphere is great for the morning power up and filling
Worth the wait to get a seat 
Come early to avoid the rush"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast, it had a funky look to the place and food and drinks are amazing. Hope they open a Vancouver location soon."}
{"text":"Steak and cheese benny was awesome  veryfresh orange juce and nice cofeeeeee the only downside , they didnt have english menu !!!!"}
{"text":"WOW!  This place is the place to be for breakfast- we tried to come early (10am) but still had to wait about 20minutes before being seated.  Much easier to get a table for 2 rather than for more as the restaurant is not very large.  We decided on a coffee & moka ($4- very YUMMY) to start and fruit skewers were (watermelon, cantalope, pineapple, prune,honeydew, grapefruit) brought out promptly.  Nice presentation.

For our mains- we had the eggs benedict on french toast and the eggs benedict with smoked salmon.  The french toast was AMAZING!  it was coated in panko and deep fried I think- the egg was perfectly cooked, not too hard and not too runny, with just enough hollandaise- a bit of black forest ham and gruyere-- all atop a puddle of maple syrup like stuff.  The sweet and salty combination  was perfect for a person that hates to have an all savory or an all salty breakfast.  Plus the toast itself was melt in you mouth good- never had toast this tender!  The smoked salmon version also was quite tasty- good amount of salmon, LOTS of sauce, and tasty little capers.

Potatoes- good, but we've had better- At Stella's Cafe & Bakery in Winnipeg, they have the same flavouring BUT they are crispier and more tender.  We like crispy! 

The decoration here was better though- interesting graffiti art on the wall, and trippy bathrooms-A+ the best bathrooms I've every visited. Very surreal effects....

Decent price for the quality of of food- about $14 for each of the egg dishes- Servers were pleasant & helpful- Would come again!"}
{"text":"A very good brunch spot in Montreal. Good portions. Yummy food. Friendly service. Be prepared for a line-up depending on the hour you come."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!  They go all out in their presentation And the portion sizes are huge. I ordered the classic benny (the hollindaise sauce was so buttery and delicious and the pot of potatoes were to perfection) it also came with a big skewer of fruit that out shines cora's any day. If you're looking for a great way to start your day definitely come here. 

The only reason I didnt give this place 5 stars is because their service could have been better..but honestly i think it was because we didn't speak french.

Oh and I decided to take the advice of others and check out their washroom...its cool check it out."}
{"text":"Expensive breakfast when you compare the other great spot in Montreal."}
{"text":"I feel a little less grumpy when I go here. Happy face :) BEST BREAKFAST IN MONTREAL! Eggs Benedict with steak and the truffles oil mushroom & egg are my top choice. The smoothies are huge! The \"moi jprends tout\" platter has everything (even the beans are delish) . There is a lineup on the weekends (be warned!).. Fml in the winter! Also their bathroom is psychedelic! Pricier than your regular breakfast place but a few dollars extra is worth it in food quality and service. Their lunches are good as well."}
{"text":"It's ok, but I dont understand all the hype and buzz about this place. Very overrated!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to L'Avenue in over 5 years but have spent a lot of time considering it! So finally I built up the courage to wait in line for some super delicious brunch. We got there at 2pm and waited 5-10 minutes for a table. For those having to wait outside, they offered hot apple cider to bide the time in cold weather. L'Avenue is a restaurant that does not cheap-out on anything. Plates are huge and juicy and delicious. If you need maple syrup for your french toast, they drop an entire can of the real stuff on your table. The service is fantastic, the ambiance is fun and the food- perfect."}
{"text":"Food: I must say that they do have an impressive selection of Eggs Benedict and drinks. However, I find that the taste was average and nothing was outstanding, I ma have been a victim of my own high expectations after waiting in line outside for more than 20 min but I find this place overrated and I would probably not come back.

Service: Very popular thus very busy = slow service unfortunately and it was very hard to get the waiters' attention.

Value: Average brunch price

Ambiance: Nicely decorated with great amount of sunlight during daytime. Ver spacious, can accommodate big groups. Easily accessible by metro, parking is a little more difficult on weekends."}
{"text":"I had to wait in a line for pretty long time but OMG. SO WORTH IT. I don't live in Montreal so I won't be able to go there anymore but SERIOUSLY. you have to have to have to have to eat at this place for brunch. Their eggs benedict was actually better than Sarabeth's in New York. I always say Sarabeth's has the best eggs benedict but maaaaan. this place ROCKS. Also their smoothie and juice and fruits and just...everything! my friend literally called the strawberries there, \"It's like...from heaven!\" LOL"}
{"text":"Love the place. Love the waitress. Love the food choices. Love the vibe. Love the food taste. Hate winter."}
{"text":"Delicious food, generous portions, beautiful presentation, good prices. Very pleased to end our trip with a brunch here after visiting Montreal. The crab cake benedict was to die for. My husband loved his French toast. My kids just about died and went to sugar induced heaven with the strawberry nutella pancakes - with plenty to feed a small army. All of the plates came with a delicious skewer of fresh fruit to start, and some with heaping portions of fruit on the side as well. The service was very friendly (and luckily bilingual). No wait for a Tuesday morning brunch, but the restaurant was packed shortly after we sat. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the salmon eggs Benedict and an Oreo frappe. Included with the meal was a large fruit skewer and garlic potatoes. It was all delicious and a large serve, I couldn't finish it all unfortunately but very satisfied. If ordering a frappe or juice with a meal I would recommend sharing as they are both very large drinks. I had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for 2 but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I had a great brunch here. Even though it has a commercial quality to it, the food is delicious. I ordered the peanut butter bacon banana crepes (I asked for the bananas to be caramelized), and I couldn't help but devour it. It was incredible."}
{"text":"C'est vrai qu'il faut bien compter 1h d'attente pour être placé. Leurs boissons aux fruits sont vraiment top et les portions vous ne serez pas déçu. Quant à la carte, il y a vraiment beaucoup de choix, d'ailleurs peut-être un peu trop. Le choix est difficile mais ils sont assez compréhensifs et peuvent adapter centaines choses. 
Le brunch que j'ai choisi, le classique avec pancakes si je me souviens bien était bon mais il y a mieux mais les pancakes étaient au top. 
J'y retournerais je pense pour y manger des pancakes"}
{"text":"This is seriously one of the best brunches I've ever had. Everything about the restaurant deserves a 5 star. The staffs were super friendly. The decor is unique and impressive. I loved the graffiti on the walls! It has one of the coolest bathrooms too! Lastly, the food was absolutely delicious. I had the steak & eggs benedict. Bonus: They serve watermelon water and my egg benedict came with fruit skewers.  If you come early in the morning, (~9 am) there is no line at all. If I ever visit Montreal again, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is an ultimate brunch place! They have line ups to get in! Have been there a few times throughout the years, never ever was disappointed! Definitely, no doubt- go there!!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is unreal! The plates are so big, you will never leave hungry, but the size does not mean a compromise in quality! The potatoes are perfectly seasoned, and the benedicts here are unparalleled. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Vous êtes sorti le samedi soir et vous souhaitez vous restaurez le dimanche ? Alors c'est l'endroit qu'il vous faut. Dans un cadre branché, servi par des jeunes gens dynamiques, vous pourrez profitez d'un excellent brunch fait de produits frais et de bonne qualité."}
{"text":"my husband and I ordered oeufs fameux with fromage and  Benedict montreal smoked meat.  They are quite good.  Better than the same food in other restaurant.

If I have to say what are not perfect on our plates are the patates rissolees and the Hollandais sauce.

The tates of the ppotatos are good and special, they are cooked with rosemary and some kind of meat.  But they are  too much minced.  I think it's because they are over-boiled.  

And we figure out they might make the Hollandais sauce by themselves, the sauce is way too rich, you will feel very stuffed after eating two Benedict eggs.

And I'm surprised that they charged for the coffee which other restaurants seem don't do. We paid $35 tax included for that meal.   

It's an enjoyable meal anyhow.  We will go back again."}
{"text":"Arrived at L'Avenue on Sunday around 9:45 am. There was already a line. Not a long one but still waited 20 minutes for a table. My brunch plate came with an assortment of fruits on a metal skewer. I really enjoyed the fruits because they were very fresh and sweet, and really opened up my appetite. The plate I ordered, Déjeuner du Ritz ($15.89), was tasty but I could only finish half of the eggs because there was just too much of it. The whole thing was very heavy and filling. The arugula salad, which was really just plain arugula, did very little to cut the richness. The croissant was nice, fluffy and flaky, and I basically stuffed as much egg and salmon and caviar into it as I could but I still had a lot left. When I left L'Avenue the line was almost three times longer than when I first got there."}
{"text":"Where do I start?! 

The line up naturally was really long. We waited 45 minutes to get in. But it was definitely worth the wait.

The decor was very retro and quirky. And the washrooms... Well those graffiti in neon paint certainly were fascinating and bold, along with that clock screen. 

I had studied the foods from other reviewers and pictures and thought I knew what I wanted... Nope! Had such a hard time deciding since everything sounded amazing, especially the egg benedicts. Eventually I settled on the egg Benedict with portobello mushrooms, bacon and arugula. 

I thought the fruit skewers that came before the meal was lovely and helped cleanse my tastebuds (especially that grapefruit!) before the main attraction arrived. 

The eggs Benedict... Wow! I didn't know where to begin! I love how plenty of ingredients (portobello mushrooms, bacon and hollandaise sauce) were provided and piled on top of one another. I wish they had put more arugula instead of just a few tiny pieces that were barely visible or could be tasted. Other than that you can taste the flavour and how well everything works together. 

The potatoes were a little bland, which is easily remedied with salt and pepper or dipping it in the hollandaise sauce. But it wasn't all that interesting to say the least. 

The hollandaise sauce got a little heavily and was weighing me down a little when I was making my way through the second benedict. Still delicious though."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I've been to. We strolled in after a long walk from rue Sherbrooke and sat right down at the only available table. 10 minutes later there was a long line out the door. On my next trip to Montreal I might eat here every morning"}
{"text":"Day 1: Let's go to L'avenue for brunch. We show up and there's like 20 people in line. \"Nahhhh we don't do lines, we'll come back tomorrow\"

Day 2: We walk our pompous asses back only to find about a 100 people in line (some even getting very touchy with each other in line. I get that brunch is a sexy thing but come on, it only made me hangrier. Respect the art of brunching am I right.)

Finally getting a table after what felt like eternity with Rico Sauve and his sidepiece going all Selena Gomez à la \"can't keep my hands to myself\", things were looking rosier. The menu has everything you want and nothing you don't, but these guys thought of it all and offer the generous \"indecisive\" option. 

French Toast: Well what can I say, as thick as a good steak, but soft and pillowy like the dreams I should be chasing. (Instead I'm stuffing my face at brunch) Maple syrup comes in a full can, butter comes in cream form, and fruits come clutch to make you feel like everything you're eating is good for you. 

The Indecisive: Pretty ironic actually that they still give you a few choices for the indecisive. That being said, salted pretzels on a stack of pancakes could not be ignored by us. Perfection in pancake form can be found here at L'avenue. Salty from the pretzels, sweet from the maple, pancakes porous enough to soak up the dulce leche; and with potatoes, sausages and ham...we could have fed a village with all the food we had. 

It's also notable to mention that once the food in the table, there was silence for a good 15 mins, and then there were groans of how stuffed I was, and then I finished the remaining half of my plate cause you know, I was bound to get hungry again in a few hours, and we didn't want that now did we. 

Service also exceptionally good considering how packed and busy this place is. If service here can be this good, it makes me wonder how I can't even get a coffee above 40 degs at Denny's.

Bonus: Super trippy UV neon glow-in-the-dark bathroom. Not for me though, I prefer my hygiene to be in the middle of the light spectrum (ie fully visible)"}
{"text":"OMG! This place by far is the best spot for breakfast in Montreal.  Definitely worth the try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The best breakfast/brunch rearaurant ever! A must go if you're on the east side of Montreal. Good people a little wait for the food but the food is just awesome!"}
{"text":"I will not go back for a long time: cockroaches!! 

There was one on the sous chefs window for all to see. I have eaten around the world where hygiene was to be desired. So I will go on record as not being squeamish. I thought to brush it off, thinking it could happen anywhere...

Then a few mouthfuls in, my friend points a second one on the wall behind me. The was no focus on the food... Only on the bugs that were all round me. If I saw TWO in broad daylight, what was lurking in the kitchen?

It saddens me to be left with such a disappointing memory of what has been an institution on the Plateau, until now."}
{"text":"Expensive but very creative and good. I applaud the work in the decoration.. even the bathroom is worth a little peek

Portions are definitively too big and wasteful."}
{"text":"My all time favourite place to eat any time any day. Crazy atmosphere that you must see to believe."}
{"text":"This breakfast place is definitely a cool place.  It's a 50's themed diner.  With amazing graffiti on the walls.  In addition the bathrooms are done with black lights and glowing walls.  Very cool!!!


Yesterday we had an amazing breakfast.
I had eggs, salad and bacon.  My girl friend had delicious onion mushroom and cheese omelet.

Great meal"}
{"text":"With the waiting time outside, the cold, and the long ass line of people, my patience and my expectations was really really high. 

After 45min of waiting, finally a seat. But HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. Probably the best brunch I had. Quality is high as hell, flavour are perfectly mix, top presentation, nice ambiance, i wish I had something bad to say but can't find any. 

45min? 30 min of wait? Go for it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place deserves 10 stars. The wait is miserable but definitely worth while. The baked beans and sausage were out of this world, not the mention their eggs Benedict were the best I have ever personally had. Ambiance is a 10. Even their bathroom is eye-catching (like what? Their bathroom? YES! The bathroom) This place is a MUST if your in Montreal. Thank you for the exceptional food and even though y'all were busy the proper customer service/attention never goes unnoticed."}
{"text":"I really like this place!!! You gotta go there at least once!  They do not take reservation, and you probably have to wait for half an hour to 45 minutes, but it is totally worth it! 

Food - we got the steak and egg benedicts and something \"complete\" (it's like the house complete breakfast meal). I'm not going to go into detail, because a lot people had already written a very good comment on it.  If you don't live in Montreal, and you don't get to go back very often, this is your first time, you need to get the steak and egg!  For the complete breakfast, it is good because you get to try almost everything is on the menu, there's a french toast, pancake, sausage, the rosemary potato, cheese.... I was so full when I get to touch the french toast and pancake, man~ it was the best french toast i've ever had and i need to finish it.

Their portion is huge, so go with an empty stomach, or small-eaters can share a plate and still may not be able to finish. 

Coffee - I ordered the big bowl mocha, it was alright, more just for fun. Their juices are better if you want to get a drink. They are all freshly squeezed."}
{"text":"Visited l'avenue for the first time, with a party of four, on a Tuesday at around 10:45. The restaurant was crowded but no line up at all. 
Not being much of a breakfast food person (not a huge fan of eggs and don't eat meat), I was a little hesitant to try this place. Luckily, l'avenue was highly recommended by a friend - I'm very glad I came!
I, myself, had the California omelette and my table had pancakes and the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. The omelette was seriously one of the best omelettes I've ever tasted! It was very big and cheesy. The potatoes were nicely seasoned and the skewer of fruits was so fresh and sweet. Two slices of toast were also included. I only finished half of the omelette- I was really hoping for a bigger appetite because it was all so good!

I would definitely come back the next time I'm in Montreal! Be sure to check out the washrooms, they're pretty neat :)"}
{"text":"Funky restaurant with generous portions. The eggs Benedict were so good . But be aware the lineup gets quite long so make sure to show up early or get comfy while you're in line. Make sure you check out the bathrooms."}

Delicious pancakes.
Great french toast.
Burger is also (surprisingly!) fantastic."}
{"text":"Decor is fun, hip and trendy. The restaurant has a laid back vibe and from what I saw, seems to always draw a large crowd. My boyfriend got the steak and eggs and I got the veggie omelette. Both dishes were good, nothing outstanding but the restaurant is worth checking out for travelers. And be sure to take a look at the bathroom!"}
{"text":"I used to go there almost every week-ends for a long period of time.  However, about a year ago there were a lot of changes in the staff and all the friendly waiters and waitresses are gone :(

The service then became very bad and unfriendly.  I have not revisited since."}
{"text":"It was worth the wait in a single degree temperature. Ordered steak & eggs, sucre-sale-croustillant ( French toast), la biquette, la kale and chorizo. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"A must go to for brunch! We waited in line for an hour and it was well worth it. From the fresh fruit smoothies to the french toast and eggs bennedict... superb!

The only annoyance is the wait of course. But when the food is good, the wait is to be expected. Another spot in Montreal we will be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"Very hip place and food was superb but not worth waiting in line for 45 minutes to get a table. It's the type of brunch place you have to at least try once because it is very tasty and has a special cool ambiance. 
Food: Excellent
Service: Great except waiting in line outside for 45 min.
Ambiance: Great"}
{"text":"Les portions sont généreuses et la qualité de la bouffe est excellente. L'ambiance est branchée et le service est très efficace. Après un peu d'attente, nous avons vite compris pourquoi cet endroit est si populaire. Très recommandé!"}
{"text":"L'Avenue is a great example of brunch/lunch done right. Walked right in on a Wednesday around 10:30, had our choice of seating. Was greeted by many smiles & asked menu language preference, a kind nod to non-Francophone speakers. Watermelon infused water & regular coffees arrived promptly as did a fruit brochette with ripe sweet fruit. Sister ordered eggs Benny with pulled pork, I had sale/sucre Benny. Both perfectly poached eggs, runny yolks. Hers on an English muffin was ample pulled pork, tender sweet, great maple flavour, covered in decadent hollandaise. Mine was 2 panko coated French toast, melted cheese topped with Black Forest ham with 2 poached eggs, covered in same decadent hollandaise. Both plates had lots of potatoes but seriously we had no room, we were so full. They also leave a full can of maple syrup on the table. Our server was super friendly and we were so happy to have visited today."}
{"text":"C'est bon, et les prix sont correcte, mais cela ne mérite pas une telle file d'attente !!! =O 
Nous n'avons attendu QUE 20 minutes, c'est correcte, mais je ne ferrai pas 2h30 de queue pour avoir un brunch ;-)"}
{"text":"I stopped by here on a Saturday around noon, bad decision, the line was ridiculous, we waited an hour plus to get in.

Once you're in the ambience if very trendy but somehow kind of campy too at the same time, its hard to describe. The tables are packed in too, real tight that have to be, if they weren't the line would be even longer.

After placing your order you're given a skewer of fresh fruit, everything on it was good even the pineapple which I normally don't like. Everything tasted very fresh to me.

The menu by the way is in French only, they do not have English versions, I know enough French to figure out mostly what everything is. My dining companion on the other hand might have been looking at Klingon thankfully the waitress spent her time explaining what everything was and ensuring that he ordered what he wanted which for some reason I now can't remember.

As for myself I ordered a strawberry banana smoothie and eggs Benedict with duck on them. The smoothie was great but it's really difficult to mess a smoothie up. The eggs Benedict on the other hand was just okay the mustard with it was too overpowering in flavor for me.

Overall L'Avenue is just a 3 because of the wait you're inevitably going to have to endure and the fact that my food was just okay overall.

There are a lot of amazing restaurants in Montreal, next time I'm going to give another one a try."}
{"text":"This place is so good that I wrote a Yelp review. Crazy, right? I had the Panko-crusted French toast Benedict. It was one of the greatest things I've put in my mouth to this day."}
{"text":"here you'll find a young crowd, upbeat (but not annoyingly so) electronic music in the background, large graffiti mural lining one wall, and one of the earlier starts in town, opening at 8am.

the meal starts off with a metal shish kabob of fruit.  it looked great but most of the fruit was under ripe.  i'll never understand why under ripe fruit seems to be the gold standard of every brunch place i go to. 

it gets much better when the main courses arrived.  i got the eggs benedict with cheddar and a compote of onions and my friend got eggs benedict with goat cheese and spinach.  i found mine to be a little too heavy but with those ingredients it wasn't going to be anything BUT heavy.  luckily my friend couldn't finish her eggs benedict and i got to have some of hers.  the difference couldn't have been greater, hers was ethereally light and far superior.  

maybe my favorite thing about the presentation of the main course was the little red cocottes filled with potatoes.  the lid kept them nice and warm throughout the meal, and it was so cute i could barely stand it.  

make sure to check out the bathrooms when you're here, because if you've ever wondered what it would be like to have a tiny nightclub in a bathroom, now is your chance.  sort of.  there's backwards graffiti on the wall that you can only read when you look into the mirror, and, when i was there, a television behind a chain link fence playing footage from a beastie boys concert.  all lit up by some kind of black light or something.  clearly they had a lot of fun designing this."}
{"text":"Cozy place thats been around for years. The have an amazing breakfast and brunch menu that us a must if your in the Plateau."}
{"text":"Forgot to review this place after my trip to Montreal. Luckily, my food was so delicious that I can recall what I got and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

We waited a LONG time for a table - if you go here, prepare to wait. I was here in the summer (July) and the line stretched about three storefronts. The fresh lemonade they had for those waiting was a nice touch. 

Upon being seated, we were almost immediately given a skewer of fruit - again, a nice touch after waiting so long and being really hungry. The coffee was nothing to write home about, but the bloody was pretty good. I had the classic Benedict for breakfast and it was DIVINE. The ham was pulled and the hollandaise was perfect. It was served over thick toast. My date got the sweet-salty-crispy Benedict. On a plate drizzled with maple syrup, panko french toast with ham, Gruyere, poached eggs topped with hollandaise - he enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Got there at 9:30am on a Sunday morning (memorial day weekend), was seated at 10:45. Ordered the eggs benedict with salmon, was delicious. Completely worth the wait. Was out by noon. And did not eat anything for the rest of the day!!"}
{"text":"My favourite brunch place in the world so far, other than maybe Medina Cafe in Vancouver. Lines are ridiculously long, but the food is worth the hour plus wait on Sunday mornings in -20 weather. Their omelettes are really fluffy, their eggs benedict heavenly, and their potatoes are probably laced with some really addictive drug because they are just so amazing!

I used to come here every few weekends and wait in line...I haven't been back for a while now since moving away from Montreal, but I still dream about this place.

L'avenue, I am coming back for you one day"}
{"text":"Nothing much to add except: AWESOME. The sweet-salty eggs benedict combines two of my favorite things about brunch: poached eggs in hollandaise and the fluffy perfection of a lovely coconutty French toast. The ham and guyere are really just cherries on top. More NYC places should do this!  The Benedict berceau has delicious delicious spicy chicken. We were less impressed by the chorizo but it was still quite yummy. Overall, a solid place that kept us stuffed for HOURS!"}
{"text":"This is a fresh, funky breakfast place on the plateau. Good food, bustling atmosphere, hip clientele. Also: cool bathrooms. Worth a trip."}
{"text":"This revue is based on multiple dinner experiences. I've never been here for brunch, but based on the revues here, it must be much better. 

I like the concept, and the menu is ok, though a little short in the appetizer options. I've had great burgers here in the past. When I was here on Friday night, however, I had THE worst salad of my entire life. I think the cucumbers were rotten (confirmed by my dining partner), and everything was doused in way too much dressing.  Our drinks were ok, but nothing special. The music was too loud for comfortable conversation, but at least they were good beats."}
{"text":"\" L'avenue \" est un lieu idéal pour aller bruncher agréablement ! 
L'intérieur est joliment décoré avec des graffitis sur les murs !
Nous avions pris des plats variés tous aussi bons les uns que les autres !
Les brochettes de fruits  divinement  présentées et très appréciées !
Ne ratez surtout pas le décor des toilettes à la hauteur du reste !  
Un lieu où il fait bon Manger !"}
{"text":"Breakfast perfection!! We went on a Thursday afternoon (around 1) & were seated within 10 min.  Everything about our meals was so so good!  Such fluffy eggs, crisp bacon that wasn't doused in grease, super fresh fruit, and various bread options (bagel, baguette, toast).  The portions were quite big, I only finished half of my plate and I've been known to throw down.  I wish I had taken pics of my amazing breakfast plate, but I was too excited and just wanted to eat it all ASAP."}
{"text":"Restaurant très sympa, bien placé avec une jolie décoration. Choix varié de plats - sucré ou salé, il y en a pour tous les goûts ! Possibilité de manger sans gluten ou végétarien avec des produits frais de qualité. Cependant un peu bruyant, mais rien de grave. Les fruits et pancakes sont à tomber ! Le petit plus, l'eau aromatisée à la pastèque."}
{"text":"The plates are seriously huge, I had to take half of it to go because I just couldn't finish it. 

The food was delicious, well seasoned and they gained points by having pink hymalayan salt on the side (even though I didn't use it). 

Quick and friendly service, and the uniforms are quirky. Really awesome atmosphere and wicked bathrooms.

Will be back soon"}
{"text":"I came here after reading all the raving reviews on yelp. We came early so fortunately we didn't have to wait in line. The restaurant is nice and cozy, but kind of cramped. I ordered a French crepe (pancakes) and thought it was okay at best. My friend ordered the blueberry pancake and said the same thing about theirs. I thought the food was overpriced for what we got; you can  get the same kind of breakfast at Cora."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and find brunch to be the beat meal of the day. We've tried many different places, some great some not. I can't place l'avenue as one the great places. It was par at best. Very average food, relatively slow service. Im surprised its rated so well I was disappointed. The portions were large, but they lacked refined tastes. If you're searching for that ultimate brunch, you will not find it here."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in the city. Super fun for tourists and very yummy. You can't wrong with nutella and french toast!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best breakfast place in Montreal! Come early b/c of the long lineups."}
{"text":"Great brunch, huge plates, we couldn't even finish half of it. We ordered the pancake with the bananas in rhum, a french toast with strawberries and bananas, the maple coffee, and a hot chocolate! The maple coffee was unique and tasty. You also get fruits with your order, which were fresh and sweet.
One of the best places for brunch in Montreal, super nice staff, just take into consideration that you need to wait in line for a place to sit."}
{"text":"Wow the best breakfast in Montreal

A MUST VISIT

Great food, original recipes, great service 
A bit pricey but it's worth it.

I will return for sure

The only bad side is the place is a bit small so u will be stuck eating beside other strangers on the same table as u if u don't get a booth.

But u forget all about it when the food  arrives"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday at 8:30 hoping to avoid the line up. Luckily, we were seated right away.  We've heard great things about the restaurant so we were very eager to try it out. We ordered the duck confit eggs benedict and the caramalized apple, cheese, and bacon french toast.  Before we got our dishes, we were served a fruit skewer. The portion of the dishes were huge. We were so impressed by the french toast, as it was so soft, and the sauce tasted amazing. It is one of the best french toasts I've had. Our server was very friendly and attentive as well. We would definitely come again when we visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a number of great brunch options. Do not go here on an empty stomach or you WILL walk away spending a ton of money and doggie bags. We ordered the chorizo and eggs benny, bobby does dallas, banana rum pancakes, mango pineapple litchi smoothie and the oreo frappe(absolutely amaze!). All equally excellent. Their watermelon flavoured water was a nice touch. The staff were friendly. Their washrooms were something worth visiting for. Fancy clock work in the washroom...almost like an art installment. I would go back if the line up isn't long."}
{"text":"I must say after staying in Montreal for 2 weeks, this is the best place to have breakfast. You have to try the classic and coin coin (duck) eggs benedict. They are the best! Coin coin and classic have a little sweet in its savoury nature. 
Don't know about the queue because I usually go at 12 noon on a weekday. The queue is short then. However waiting time still is a little long. Did I mention there's a super duper cute and awesome welcomer? He literally swept my friends and I off our feet when we first saw him. Be sure to give this place a try!
Decorations in the cafe is just nice, it isn't too much. However I must say as much as I love the washrooms, it's quite scary as they have changed to glow in the dark paints."}
{"text":"Only one warning -- the portion was big :-) I ordered fruit breakfast, it came with extra bread and fruits. It was a big meal and it was so delicious!"}
{"text":"Waited about an hour, line was super long but moved fast. Well worth it. Had a whole page dedicated to eggs Benedict and wanted to try them all. Went with the Rainbow and it was amazing it was served with a fresh fruit skewer to start and came with breakfast potatoes which were also awesome. Portions are really big so come hungry. My husband had the bobby in Spain omelette and that was also really good. Def would return."}
{"text":"Toujours un endroit amusant à aller, surtout après une grosse soirée. Mais pour ne pas trop attendre, il faut se lever tôt. Sinon, armez-vous de patience! Mais si les gens attendent, alors qu'il y a tellement de choix dans le coin, c'est parce que c'est BON!
 
Emmenez votre appétit, car les assiettes ne sont pas pour les petits mangeurs. Personnellement, je ne peux faire autrement que de me laisser tenter par une de leurs variations d'uf bénédictines. Et chaque fois, à coup sûr, je jure sur ma vie que je ne mangerai plus jamais... et puis arrive l'heure du souper..."}
{"text":"Boy was this place worth the wait. The line was out the door when my fiancé and I showed up on Sunday at approximately 10:30 AM, however the line moved quickly. We were seated within 15 to 20 minutes. The menu selection was very diverse. There are a lot of traditional and unique dishes to chose from. My fiancé went with the eggs Benedict with 4 year old cheddar cheese and caramelized onions and I went with a standard egg dish. We were given very generous portions for both dishes and split an awesome fruit and ginger smoothly. 

The atmosphere had a very cool vibe. The walls were covered with graffiti aft and the bathrooms were filled with neon lights - very interesting."}
{"text":"Awesome place. I love the atmosphere, very retro artsy. Every meal comes with fresh cut fruit before the meal. I got the Idaho omelet which was orgasmic!! Just be prepared for a line cause there is always one. We went on a friday at 1 and the place was packed. Wasn't an awful wait though. And the food is definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"There was a long wait and when we got to the middle of the line we got in. Then we sat down on a table and the waiter looked at us like we were monsters and he said let me check for American menus. Then we waited for a while and the people who got in at the same time as us already got their food and we didn't even have our drinks yet. Then a few mins passed and we got a fruit kabob then my whole family except me got their. They got coffee and  Nutella coffee then a few mins passed again and there was this huge milkshake with an Oreo in it. It was huge! It was really good. Then it happened again. Everyone gets their food except for me and my sister. Then a min later our food comes out and it looks amazing. The bacon was so good it was cooked perfectly. And I usually don't like scrambled eggs but those eggs were perfect. It really brought out the egg flavor. The sausage was so good it tasted like heaven but overall the food was cold even the coffee. It was okay I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Excellent benedict. I always go for the spinach and goat cheese one as I find it the most flavorful. The side of potatoesand portions are good. Decor is nice. 

Unfortunately, it's downhill from here.

The remaining Benedicts are soso. The Latte, burger, salad and omelette were meh.

Service is curt most of the time. Waiting lines are chaos from what I've heard -I never bother waiting in line as the place isn't worth it- and are pretty long on the weekends.

I stopped suggesting this place due to all of the above.

If you're up for a hot drink after, Art Java cafe across the street serves good -but overpriced- Lattes."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict is the specialty and they are not joking. Best I've had. Worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Best egg bene i have evr had....comes with a skewer of fruit with every dish.....even their potatoes wer to die for...i order a drink too but i dont know if I would order one of those again....if u go in...go to use the washroom.....otally awesome...."}
{"text":"The best restaurant by far we went to during our stay in Montreal. We had one the best egg entrees we have had in a long time there. Even the oatmeal and pancakes we ordered for our kids were above your average restaurant. Additionally, the service was excellent. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is the best...

I just noticed they use salt (pink) from the Himalayas, no iodine, talk about passion for food :-)"}
{"text":"Staff&service 4 / 5  food 4 / 5 decor 4 / 5 
I get why there's a big hype for tourists..the decor is cool, the menus are funky looking and the combinations of food are odd but tasty. However the lineups are long and the time to get the menus is long too. If you're visiting montreal I recommend it but if you are from the area don't bother, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to l'avenue this morning around 10:00 for brunch. We both had the same dish, the eggs Benedict bonette, it's a vegetarian version of eggs Bennie. It was loaded with vegetables, so delicious, easily the best eggs benni I've ever had. Service was good, waiting time was 10-15 minutes which I expected. The reason I gave it 3 out of 5 stars is because the potatoes were sub par, and for me personally the breakfast potatoes are the most important part of the meal."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD. We waited, sure. But it was totally worth it lol. I'm sure everyone says the same exact thing. It's seriously sooooooo yummy and perfect!"}
{"text":"Background: I was on vacation in Montreal and was looking for a delicious spot to eat brunch! I had a omelette with mushrooms, chicken, spinach, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers and a side of potatoes (not pictured)

Pros

1. Extremely frequently staff 
2. Clean
3. Short wait time (I think it was because we went on a Tuesday)
4. Fruit skewer comes with every order :) 

Cons

1. No English menu 

Overall: AMAZING! I absolutely love this place! It was suggested by one of my sister's friends and I would highly recommend it for anyone looking to have a great meal for brunch. Indoor decor was very hipstery which I loved!! Initially, I found it hard to find what I wanted to eat because they did not have an English menu but the staff were kind enough to take me through every option. If you do have dietary restrictions, emphasize that multiple times. My omelette came with a fruit skewer(not pictured) , a thin slice of sesame bagel (also not pictured), and a salad. Everything was delicious!!! I have no complaints. Thank you L'avenue! I will be back :)"}
{"text":"This place was different, interesting, and very tasty. I had the original eggs benedict with a delicious cafe au lait, and husband had the salmon eggs benedict. Garlic potoes are fantastic! And I loved the fruit skewer.

The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 is because nothing was in English. I was able to pick out most words, so it was still good. Service was nice, and they were able to understand me."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place ever. Their breakfast potatoes are the best. Their eggs Benedict are pure delight. I also like the breakfast burrito. Their coffee is really fresh and good, so are their freshly made juice. Service is good and friendly. The decor and ambiance are unique. The bathroom are spotless and very original. The downside is that this place is so popular that there is often a huge line up ..."}
{"text":"Let me sum up what's good here:
1. Portion-price ratio
2. Good music selection
3. Savory holland Sauce on Eggs benedict
4. Home fries that are buttery and taste like potato5
5. Fresh fruits on shishkabob stick (didn't know canada could have fresh tropical fruits)
6. Cheap, unlimited coffee refills

bonus: take a camera with you to the bathroom. black lights, drawings, and the tv screen make it the coolest bathroom i've ever been in."}
{"text":"Loooove their eggs Benedict! Everything on the plate was so delicious and the portion was so big that I couldn't finish it. We went there on a workday so it wasn't too crowded. Great service and good food!"}
{"text":"I came here with my sister on a Monday morning and to our surprise there was a line out the door.  Nonetheless, the line progressed quickly, and anyway, whatever we waited, it was completely worth it!

I had THE BEST PANCAKES I have ever had in my life.  These were pancakes with Nutella, bananas, and coconut shavings accompanied with the Captain Morgan Rum flavored syrup.  The large mocaccinos we had we also delicious!

Our server was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Waited about one hour but the food is great value! Big portion and love their smoothies! Interesting washroom."}
{"text":"Best eggs benedict I've ever had! 

My husband and I took a trip to Montreal for the long weekend and decided to come here for brunch.  

First, HUGE line out the door.  It was freezing in montreal that weekend and it was no fun lining up outside.  It seems to be the trend in Montreal as most places we went to that weekend seemed to have a line up out the door! Regardless, this place was totally worth the wait in the cold. 

Inside, it's a bit cramped but I don't mind being cramped as long as I'm not waiting in the freezing cold...so good for them for maximizing space usage in their restaurant! 

The menu is completely in French and despite me having taken French well into my senior year of high school, I was pretty rusty and was pretty thankful for Mr. Google translator! haha 

I ordered the eggs benedict with panko crusted french toast.  It was the perfect blend of sweet and salty.  So good...best eggs benedict ever!  My husband ordered the steak and eggs benny.  Very different flavours in the two dishes but very well developed flavours.  We enjoyed both thoroughly.  We also loved the skewer of fruit! 

The only complaint we had was that service a bit slow.  We ordered right after the table next to us ordered but we didn't get our food until they were almost finished their breakfast! 

We will definitely be visiting this place again on our next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Un restau qui a maintenant de la bouteille. Connu pour ses toilettes très originales et sa bonne bouffe"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for their menu. What a well designed menu and an efficient kitchen churning out yummy food! A must visit if you are ever in mtl."}
{"text":"Première fois à l'Avenue, et c'était pour un brunch! 

Le restau est situé sur l'avenue Mt Royal à deux pas du métro, on le reconnait facilement par la file d'attente dehors. 

L'intérieur est assez grand avec pas mal de tables, la musique est assez forte, même le matin, pour ma part j'ai eu le droit aux Doors, j'étais aux anges, pas sur que ça plaise à tout le monde en tout temps! 

La carte est originale, depuis sa présentation jusqu'aux noms des déjeuners complet, je regarde attentivement et opte pour un complet \"Ben moi j'prends de toute\" avec un frappé choco framboise! 

Les plats mettront un peu de temps à arriver, surtout que la disposition fait que les tables voisines sont proches, on à le temps de jeter des coups d'oeils à droite à gauche ce qui donne envie de tout gouter et de nous affamer encore plus. 

Le moment tant attendu arriva, les portions sont monstrueuses, je ne savais plus par quoi commencer; tout était bon, le sirop d'érable coule à flot, rien que d'y repenser... 

Une chose est sure, j'y retournerai, le rapport qualité prix est excellent, le serveur qui se chargeait de notre table drôle et sympa, une bonne adresse!"}
{"text":"I've never had such an amazing brunch. I was so sad that I couldn't finish the egg Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was amazing ! This place is known for this and I highly recommend the chorizo egg Benedict. If you're not starving , share ! The potatoes was really good too. I think the watermelon water adds a nice touch. We arrived before there was even a lineup. Thank goodness because it was so packed by the time we left."}
{"text":"Such a fun place. Everything was superb from our coffee to our mimosas to our breakfast. I had a vegetable omlette with goat cheese and asparagus which was great but the real highlight was my boyfriend's eggs Benedict with smoked meat. The potatoes were awesome and the fruit was fresh. Our waitress was very sweet and offered great service. Even the bathroom was a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap! 

It is ideal to get there before 9:00 as a line tends to form around that time. 
They have fantastic coffee and whatever you order I guarantee you'll enjoy.
The Eggs Benedict are great, with really well-made hollandaise sauce."}
{"text":"So, my husband and I were recently in Montreal for a weekend and saw L'Avenue in guidebooks as a great place for brunch. Fodors did not lie. Brunch at L'Avenue was great! So, they only had French menus and neither me nor hubby can read French very well so we muddled through. 

I though I was ordering crepes with mango, strawberries and kiwi. I didn't know that crepes American are pancakes. I was pleasantly surprised. A large order of pancakes arrived with hot fruit on top and warm syrup. They were amazing and well worth it. My husband got Eggs Benedict and really enjoyed them as well. His meal came with a kebob of fruit, which was a nice touch. 

The atmosphere was cramped and chaotic but it was fun as well. The food took a little while to arrive so don't go if you are in a hurry. We went around 9:30 am on a Saturday and it wasn't that crowded but there was a huge line by the time we let about a hour later."}
{"text":"Had a bad morning.  Got a flat tire last night and my wife had a hangover.  We needed good food and we found it.  This place is the best breakfast place in Montreal period.
I will be back for more and I will tell everyone to go.  Oh and don't let the decor distract you.

Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"L'Avenue is one of my favourite Montreal dining experiences. Judging from the line up I waited in, it's also a favourite of many others. They offer delicious food for every meal, including a coveted breakfast and delicious and creative lunch and dinner options. I was especially enamoured with their sesame and tofu salad. Unfortunately, the veggie burger was a bit mealy and bland. 

I would also imagine this is one of the cooler places to go in Montreal for food. Even their weird heavily curtained entrance seems to shun the outside world. The lighting and decor is awesome, especially in the bathroom. It basically feels like a red lit cage with various art on the walls and intense movies playing on a TV in the wall by the sink (Party Monster was playing while I used the facilities). On that note, if you take kids here, you may want to make sure they pee before arriving."}
{"text":"Cute decor, ok atmosphere, good location.  Sadly I have to agree with many of the other negative review points for L'avenue.  Crowded, loud, wait staff with enough snotty attitude for all of Montreal and the food was just eh.  
Seriously, I've had my fair share of eggs Benedict in my life & theirs was nothing special & def not worth the hype & other crap you have to put up with there.  It took our waiter 45 minutes just to take our coffee order, mean while he was hanging out at the counter chatting.  Insulting.  And he refused to speak in English & said there was no English menu.  Or so we were told.  We did try to speak in French, but I find it ridiculous when EVERY other place in Montreal is more than happy to speak in English & French."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! This spot has it all: cool vibe, good service, strong drinks and absolutely delicious food. Many people seem to think so as well, you'll see them lined up outside in a freezing cold. I suggest reservations or come early, either way this is the place worth standing on line for - just not in -20 :)) Eggs Benedict seems to be their staple dish, there are like 20 variations of them. Anything you get comes with fresh fruit and home fries. This is not your regular home fries though - this is the perfection, the absolute king of any home fries I ever had. Anyway, food is phenomenal, finger-licking good. A must visit while in Montreal!"}
{"text":"If you are to come to L'Avenue be prepared to wait in line and no matter how long that line is... or how cold it is outside I strongly suggest you do not leave because there is no better place to have breakfast/brunch in Montreal. L'Avenue is cutting edge cool, techno music blares in the background regardless of the time of day, the waitstaff all have funky hairstyles and tattoos, and oh yeah... the food is pretty awesome as well. L'Avenue's menu is extensive they offer delicious pancakes , crepes, waffles, smoothies, omlettes... they even have a lunch menu... and if you fancy an alcoholic apertif you can order whatever you want because they have every sort of alcohol imaginable. Whatever you order make sure to get the potatoes... they are to die for."}
{"text":"The food was very ordinary, and the experience unremarkable. Not sure why everyone lines up there every weekend. The only awesome thing about this place was the bathroom."}
{"text":"Very good brunch place, wide selection of brunches available, but be prepared to queue for at least 40 minutes. 

The staff is efficient, the food is great regardeless of age/culinary tastes... 

...and you do need to check out the toilets before you go (unique design)"}
{"text":"We love Montreal and this is a great representation of Le Plateau's funky vibe.  The decor is unsparingly hipster (exercise bike nailed upside down to the ceiling? Wow).  The bathrooms are a must see, just wash your hands if you don't have to go.  The pre-food fruit kebab was a cute touch.  Yes, the menu was only in French but our waitress was very accomodating of our monoliguicity.  The portions are ginormous, so keep that in mind when ordering.  No complaints, only praise, for our orders which included omelette, pancakes, french toast, and several iterations of coffee.  The price was not cheap for breakfast ($100 for four including tip) but not excessive either."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good breakfast place in the amount Royal area on a Thursday morning. My girlfriend found great Yelp reviews on L'Avenue. We walked around the corner to it and were impressed with the stylish, contemporary décor. 

The menu is all in French. Our skills are low. However, our waitress was helpful and described everything to us. We ordered from the Benedict section. There is a huge selection of unique, carefully crafted options. We ordered the duck (coin coin) and chorizo benedicts. They offer a gluten free option which is on portobello mushroom for $2 instead of English muffin. This is what we chose for both. 

Before our benedicts came to us, we were each served a big surprise skewer of fruit. Perfect! The benedicts came and they were huge. They also came with great potatoes. The duck one was savory. Lots of flavour. The chorizo one was very tasty. The sausage was a bit chewier than I prefer, but I enjoyed the flavour. 

We would have been fine ordering one Benedict between the two of us instead of one each. Even with my big appetite, they were way too large for us to finish and we left a lot on the plate. 

I highly recommend L'Avenue. I would go back because I love the food and the atmosphere. Oh! Go to the bathroom there too. Their bathrooms are soooo cool!"}
{"text":"Had to wait for ~45 minutes outside, but worth the wait! My friend and I both had their arc-en-ciel egg benedict (the smoked salmon one) and it was so so good! It also came with a fruit skewer and house potatoes. I also got a soy milk cappuccino, which hit the spot. Service was a little slow, but our waitress was fantastic. They also have a watermelon water \"tank\", which is different, but I really enjoyed the added hint in my water :) The decor is mismatched, but cool - we got a table with a bike mounted on the ceiling! Their washroom is also really neat - awesome graffiti and \"blue light\" lit. I wouldn't wait for that long during the winter (though they have coffee outside, which is nice!), but would definitely come again (just not when I'm already super hungry haha)."}
{"text":"The French toast was incredible. Berries on top were incredibly fresh and delicious. The spiced potatoes were lovely and all around this was probably the most delicious breakfast I've had in the world. The place itself has a lot of character and the waitress quickly switched to English when my French was so awful. The bathroom was a surprise- beautifully graffitied with an embedded tv showing Sin City. I will miss this place. It was so good I went back a second time for a second breakfast during my 2 weeks in Montreal, and had an omelet. Fluffy and beautiful, and the potatoes were still amazing. I travel a lot and I've never had a breakfast this good. (I admit, my friend had some eggs benedict that came on top of French toast, and she definitely chose best- some of everything they do well.) I think I'd ask for this as my last meal if I ever had to choose one."}
{"text":"Worth waiting for 30 mins. I had an egg benedict with fruits. You're gonna get more quantity of food than you're seeing in the picture. One of server didn't get me a coke but not a big deal. They seemed to be too busy because it was Saturday lunch time."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed with the service. I have food allergies and the staff was rude and not helpfull at all! They were not willing to accommodate at all or make a lunch item early because they had nothing that I could eat. The closest option was a fruit skewer. Which was pitiful. My children order fruit and egg platers and they had more fruit then what was offered to me. If you have any allergies don't go here!"}
{"text":"Perfection. Whenever I don't go here for brunch, I regret it. Extremely accommodating for special requests - so the one gripe people (sometimes) have about this place (that it's too greasy/heavy) is easily fixed (veggies instead of potatoes, for instance). BEST IN THE WORLD! And Alex the hot waiter is the besssst!"}
{"text":"Great menu. Great vibe-waited in line, jammed packed place. Negatives were long wait and slow service made it a 2 plus hour brunch and felt understaffed with hurried waiter having little time to help us with our menus choices."}
{"text":"The Best Brunch place in North America Period. Drop Mic!"}
{"text":"Diabetics should avoid ordering anything heavy. Huge sugar rush after only 3 bites into bacon-cheese-caramel smothered pancakes. Epic Meal Time fans would have a field day here.  Running to the restroom while high on sugar and caffeine was probably a poor decision. Oh man, definitely not a restroom you wanna be in while trippin' off of anything. Extremely clean though. I gave up on the first dish after starting to feel my veins clogging up with sugary goodness and the wait-staff opted not to charge me for it while I waited for my second order. I had to tip her the cost of the first dish anyway, else I couldn't live with myself not paying it forward to someone so empathetic to my sugar-overdose plight."}
{"text":"One of the absolute best places for brunch in Montreal. The menu is very diverse, you get a ton of food, the service pretty good and the vibe of the place is fun too.

The ONLY downside is the wait. If you don't show up EARLY, you are likely to wait at least 1 hour. If that isn't a problem for you, then great, but rarely have brunch here anymore since the wait is just too long. Weekdays are better, but surprisingly, there can be long waits as well."}
{"text":"Premier endroit où je suis allez en arrivant, ça encourage à essayer d'autre chose par la suite.
Plats copieux et bien présentés.
Il y en a pour tous les gouts. L'ambiance décalée et la thématique change d'un brunch habituel, surtout lorsque l'on arrive tout frais de Paris avec du sirop d'érable plein la tête!
L'accueil chaleureux et le service aux petits oignons permettent de passer un agréable moment!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast destination, but you've got to wait.  Slow dining, pretty much guarantees a need for lots of patience.  It may take an hour or so to get a seat at times. Simple for me...I want the heart attack special of eggs benedict, french toast and milk...yum. Worth the wait? I think so."}
{"text":"The most delicious brunch place I've been to in Montreal. Their eggs benedict are made perfectly and the smoothies are great too! The fruit kebabs are also a unique and very nice touch I've never seen anywhere else. 

Only downsides are the wait (the line is usually 30 minutes to over an hour at peak times, even when it's -30 in the winter!), and the busy environment - tables are really close together so you don't have much privacy. One time I was seated right next to the door when it was cold out, and having it repeatedly open every few seconds while trying to enjoy a meal was not great. 

Aside from those warnings, highly recommend as the food is amazing."}
{"text":"After waiting 1hour for a table... we finally sat down and ordered a fresh cocktail!
The food was really good and the restroom spectacular! 
Don't forget to check them out!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on a weekday morning around 930 and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, but this was DEFINITELY worth it. 

The other reviewers have said the same things, but I would recommend the nutella coffee and savory sweet crunchy benedict. It came with a skewer of fresh fruit and a side of potatoes which was also delicious. 

One of the best breakfasts I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The food here is totally great

If you want to pig out on brunch, go here. So many heavy nice things on menu, includes highly respectable fruit brochette and potatoes

my favourite is the sucre sale benny but definitely share it between two people because it is massive and probably like 3000+ calories all in."}
{"text":"J'aime aller déjeuner à l'Avenue pour les belles brochettes de fruits. C'est tout le temps bon et le service est rapide. Victime de sa popularité, il y a souvent une file d'attente."}
{"text":"In love with their eggs benedict!!!  Wish they had one in toronto

The place had a great vibe, amazing decor and even better brunch."}
{"text":"This was our last restaurant stop in MTL before heading back home, and boy was it a bittersweet breakfast. We lucked out at 9 AM on Friday morning - no line! The eggs benedict (classique) was delicious and I was unable to finish half due to the generous portion. Got the iced coffee which was ginormous (and a little too acidic for my taste) but it was cutely garnished with coffee beans which was a nice touch. Our waiter, Jeff, was such a sweetheart! Definitely will be back. A trip to MTL isn't complete without stopping here."}
{"text":"What to say about l'Avenue, it is such a hip and vibing environment. Every single time I come here , I can't help it but to enjoy the originality of the restaurant. The staff is polite, nice and courteous, they definitely care about the customers. Service can be slow but that's completly normal I think in such a restaurant when rushes seem to be ordinary and some orders' mistakes could happen. 

The menu is vast and offers an insane variety of choice for everyone's taste from brunch to dinner choices.

I took what I usually take , \"Bon Ben moi jprend toute\" , it was very good , definitely a huge meal I'm actually surprise I finished it this time. My bread was a little bit hard , and I couldn't really appreciate it's taste with the creton. However, pretty much everything else was the perfection . My scrambled eggs was delicious, I had a large portion of delightful sausages and bacon. The mashed potatoes are really good, I will admit that. And lastly , the fruits were fresh and tasty to my tummy.

Really looking forward to next time L'Avenue!"}
{"text":"We went to L'Avenue New Years Day around 1pm and had to wait an hour before getting seated. However, the wait was definitely worth it! The staff is really nice and speak both French and English. 

I ordered the Bobby in Spain and the combination of chorizo, spinach, mushroom, eggs, and potatoes were out of this world. My boyfriend got the All In and he was blown away as well with how everything worked together on the plate. All the meals came with a fruit bouclette and served with watermelon fused water. One of the greatest brunches I've had in a while and will for sure come back the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"It's my second time here and we came on a Tuesday. I was surprised to see how packed it was even on a weekday. A lot of locals go here and there's no English menu, so be prepared to be a little clueless when you are ordering at first. The portions are huge and the food is delicious. 4 star because I felt that it was a bit pricey for brunch food."}
{"text":"Oh, if I could give it 10 stars, I would. 

Best breakfast ever. So tasty and large portions. Every dish comes with a cup of all-so-tasty red skinned potatoes, so soft, creamy, and flavorful. And that's just the side potatoes. I had the truffle omelet..comes with tons of mushrooms and spinach...a bit salty but so flavorful. And everyone gets a fruit ka bob! How unique and healthy! They had a whole eggs benedict section, which I was thinking of getting since they seem to specialize in them.

The menu's in French which is pretty cool to me. The waiter was happy to translate it in to English for us.

Get there early for breakfast. Went on Labor Day, around 10:15am. In 10 minutes, the line went from us 4 to maybe 20 people! What makes everyone feel uneasy is that they don't take down your names when waiting. A young busboy looking person comes out and makes an acknowledgement of your face.

Love this brunch place!! Food's so good!!"}
{"text":"Had brunch on a Thursday. Small wait at the door for you the restaurant is likely to be good.
Instincts were right one of the best brunches i have had in a long time.
Both myself and my fiancee enjoyed the food and the restaurant decor.
Service was pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best breakfast I've ever had.  Be warned, the menu is purely in french, but you'll be able to figure it out.
I had the classic benedict.  Eggs were perfect and the Canadian Bacon was sliced thin so it was easy to get too.  Hollandaise was buttery and had a nice acidity.  Husband had an omelette which was more like a fritatta, huge and sooo good.  The Mocha Frappe was like an adult milkshake with a serious caffeine kick.  I wish I could get it like that every morning.  I despise breakfast potatoes, and these, yea, they were something else. 
Get there early if you can, as it gets really busy.  Make sure you go into the bathroom and instagram that ish."}
{"text":"I was pointed in the L'avenue direction from co-workers, friends and the Yelp community. I was a fan even before arriving in Montreal.

I got off at the Mont Royal metro and eagerly walked down Mont Royal looking for the L'avenue sign. Surprise, surprise there was a wait... I got there at about noon on a Saturday. With rain & hail, it wasn't pleasant. 

Nonetheless, I waited it out because I've beent old that the wait was worth it. I ALMOST gave up at the 40 minute mark, and even went to the nearby Second Cup to refuel. 

I'M SO GLAD I WAITED. 

I ordered the Steak & Eggs benedict, and it was to DIE FOR. You get 2 perfectly poached egg, over Angus Beef steak and hollandaise sauce... with delicious potatoes.  Best eggs benedict I've ever had. 

So, end story, if you can go during an off-time (i.e. weekdays), then go to L'avenue for brunch. And if you can only go during a busy time (i.e. weekends), then STILL go to L'avenue for brunch. Best decision I made during my visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"10/10
Holy fucking mother of fucking God. Let's get shitfaced tonight after such an amazing breakfast on Christmas eve. This is, honestly, the best restaurant I've ever been to. All those positive references are so right. We arrived at 1pm for breakfast, we were 2 people and waited not even 5 minuted until we got seated in an amazing place in the back of the restaurant. I was totally overhelmed of how awesome this place is, there were many people in there, the food looks nice, and so does it taste. And the portions are huge, and not overpriced. The toilet is the most fancy one i've ever seen, you have to move your ass in there or you will regret it. If you can't, take a coffee and get some free refills first. I have no idea how my meal was called, the card is only in French, but a surprise is a good thing sometimes ;) and I was not disappointed - that thing was like a whole family dinner on a cut in half whole bread - and the Mokka was really good as well. 
$22 before tip for mokka and that complete breakfast. Fruits with real maple sirup as a free appetizer makes everything perfect. Just, go in there, you have to! 
Only the waiter didn't show up often, but he's excused as there were so many people. And all the other waiters looked friendly and were really busy as well, so yeah. Go there."}
{"text":"Hip but not pretentious. Amazing eggs no matter how you like them.  Creative cuisine.  Huge portions.  No extras for baguette bread, free coffee refills, fresh fruits and friendly staff.  A bit loud on the w-e but perfect for drowning that ringing in the ears from partying the night before."}
{"text":"L'Avenue is awesome! If you are from Montreal, chances are you know this place already been here! If not, tourists please go and enjoy ANY delicious breakfast on the menu. They offer lunches as well, haven't tried on my end so I can't say exactly my thoughts on it but if you are looking for a breakfast place! The staff is pretty friendly too! This is probably a Top 10! 

Pros:
- An great variety of breakfast offered and their potatoes are delicious!!
- Each plate I believe comes with a fruit brochette (Skewer)
- Their regular filter coffee is AMAZING
- The funky vibe of the place! 
*** I don't usually use public bathroom but you gotta visit this one ;) 

Cons: 
- There is often a line-up in week-end but trust me worth the wait! Otherwise they have a new location on 3612 Notre-Dame St W, probably with less traffic! Check it out!"}
{"text":"It certainly won't make you feel healthier, but if you want to have a very nice, casual supper or breakfast, L'Avenue is one of the best place you can find in Montreal."}
{"text":"We were there on the Monday of May24 long weekend. I believe they are open at 8am but we were there at 9am , knowing fully this placed would be so packed. However, once we got there, we were seated in about 5mins (perhaps because we are only a party of 2 and it's easier to squeeze us in). 
You can ask the menu to be in English and you have got to try their smoothies. I had the strawberry raspberry lychee smoothie and it was HUMONGOUS. so I had the sweet and savory eggs benedict. Holy smokes..even typing this weeks later still make my mouth waters. It was absolutely delicious. Then again, it has a huge portion. The eggs benedict menu comes with potatoes and fresh fruits. 
For the speediness of service, don't you worry for waiting too long. These waitresses are great and very fast in their service. 
For the amount that we paid, it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Good food.  It a diner themed breakfast or lunch place.  Servings are huge.  Very good food.  Good service.  Didn't give a fifth star because the place is packed with a waiting line almost every day, and through your meal they will hurry you a bit.  This was not the experience in other places nearby.  Otherwise, very nice meal."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! Their Eggs Benny are the best I've ever had anywhere!"}
{"text":"Go to brunch place in Montreal.  Don't know if it's worth the wait though.  Go during the week if you can when it's less busy.  We did and we ended up running into Georges St. Pierre!!  Eggs Benedict and GSP, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"This is the best place for brunch in Montreal, no doubt. Prices are very acceptable and the food is amaaazing! The service is excellent also and very good looking :) Ambiance is very cool to be a brunch place... 
But (and that's the reason why I don't go that often), the line is all the time HUGE! On weekends you can expect to wait at least 30 minutes, or even an hour! I'm not kidding!!!
So, if you love food, and you are willing to wait, this place is the best option, if you don't care that much, well, there's other places around the area.
If you are visiting Montreal, I recommend it definitely, but go earlier than 10 so you don't wait that long :)"}
{"text":"Just when you thought you've seen all the takes on eggs benedict you can find ... L'avenue proves you wrong!  Ex-montrealer friends were dreaming about this place, so we went while they were visiting. 
I had the Mr Seguin eggs benedict .. it was an awesome combination of goat cheese, spinach and sauteed mushrooms. The toppings on the english muffin were pretty generous and I wish I could have finished it all.  The presentation was nice  too - it came with a little pot of home-fries (good, not at all greasy) and a nice skewer of melon and other fruit. 
I also stole a bite of chicken eggs benedict - it was delicious! A good choice for someone who likes a little bit of spice and heat.  The steak eggs benedict was also really good.. with a spicy twist on the classic Hollandaise. 
The service was good and the staff was friendly. The food arrived quickly, though the first cup of coffee took a while to arrive. 
Expect about $20/person. 
Highly recommend!

PS. take a trip to the washrooms - they're crazy!"}
{"text":"First time going to L'avenue for brunch. I have heard lots of recommendations for this brunch place and I finally understand why! The line was worth the wait. I had the steak and eggs with cheese. Very good! I also got to try the salt, sweet and crispy eggs Benedict ( also a must try!)"}
{"text":"Ce petit bijou de l'avenue mont-royal se démarque déjà par le mannequin coloré dans la vitrine. C'est un endroit coloré avec un menu qui sort de l'ordinaire. Il y a une multiple de choix qui peuvent rejoindre tous les goûts! Le seul hic, arrivez en avance car la file peut être assez longue, surtout durant la saison haute et les fins de semaine."}
{"text":"I missed out on this place once since my boyfriend has a rule that he doesn't wait in line for annnything but with enough nagging he came around to it the next day and said it was worth the 30 minute wait after a bite of the steak and eggs benedict. From all the rave reviews ut's obvious the food is good, the bathroom is cool, the decor is hip- but what really impressed me was the super friendly unpretentious service despite how crazy busy they were. The server took the time to explain the menu since it was all in french and we did not speak a lick of it. She was attentive throughout and seemed to really make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"L avenue is one those places where we will wait for 1h to get a table. The wait is long, but it is worth for the great brunches they serve. 

The service is fast as usual.
 L'Avenue is casual place. It puts you in a good mood. You feel the positive and good vibes. I just love the decor. Very nice and psychedelic painting. Even the restroom have its own touch. Check the pics I posted. 

There are lots of great drinks and cocktails.  
We ordered l'indecis eggs tour style bacon , beans, sausage, the usual but it is very tasty. You can feel the mix of flavor in a single platter. Their pancakes looks like homemade ones from scratch without any pre-made ingredients. You can taste the difference between what l'Avenue serves and what the other commercial restaurants offer.
I would add that their portions are amazing, big and very generous. 
I would highly suggest this restaurant for a traditional breakfast on a winter or summer day and also to discover new tastes.

I like the waiters and the hostess. They are professional. The hostess constantly updates you of the waiting time."}
{"text":"Clean hipster restaurant with really large portions. So big that they even suggested that we have our children share the French toast instead of order a plate each. ( this would never happen in America where they push you to over order! ) our waiter was very kind and treated my children like young adults - I appreciated that he didn't talk down to them. We went in a Sunday morning around 12noon and only had to wait 10 minutes. My husband and I shared the breakfast poutine which was just delicious with poached eggs and breakfast potatoes. The only thing that was confusing for us what the difference was between table syrup and maple syrup- no one seems to ever use the table syrup so why even have it? Why ruin your food with sugar water? I think they should just do away with it and always have sirop d'érable (maple syrup) on the table. This is Quebec after all!  Don't miss this restaurant when you're next in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I love a hearty breakfast, and this was one of the best breakfast experiences I have ever had.

The spicy chicken eggs benedict was amazing!  It could feed two people.  Really cool bathroom too!"}
{"text":"Standing in line for brunch - wasn't really worth the wait. 

Decor is interesting. 
The place is full and service made you feel rushed and evident that they want to flip the table. 
Egg Benedict was good - but nothing that was mouth watering delicious. 

The service (rushing, not attentive, and impatient) doesn't make me want to go back.
Not the worst brunch experience I have had, but no-where near excellent either."}
{"text":"Les brunchs sont vraiment bons, mais pas très originaux. Il y a beaucoup de bruit, et une longue attente avant de pouvoir entrer dans le restaurant. Ces petits inconvénients ne nous pas empêcher de nous régaler dans ce restaurant de brunchs typiques."}
{"text":"I read about the hype behind this place so we had to check it out. There was a line on a Monday late afternoon but wasn't bad for 2 people. Maybe waited like 15 mins. 

The Food was excellent. My wife got the steak eggs Benedict which was amazing. I got the \"a little bit of everything\" breakfast which was good but I would say the French toast and pancakes were better than the rest of the breakfast. Drinks were good. I had the Bloody Cesar which is a Bloody Mary with a bit of clam juice mixed in there. It's a Canadian thing and I enjoyed it. 

Inside the atmosphere was busy. Lots of noise and a lot of things going on which is what you would expect in a somewhat crowded and popular brunch spot. The bathroom is really cool too. It's kind of like a club in there with a night light and drawings on the walls. 

I think next time I will try a different rendition of eggs Benedict. There are so many to choose from. Also, the portions are generous so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant. The aesthetics and style are interesting and the bathroom is a must see. 

The food was also very good. I had the \"I want it all\", which literally had everything (bacon, ham, pancakes, French toast, beans, cretons, a small baguette, scrambled eggs with cheese, and potatoes). To drink I had a Coconut water coffee with chocolate; interesting combination but it was perfect. 

All in all, great experience."}
{"text":"-egg benny excellent, hamburgers large and very tasty
-do not go on sun or sat, avoid peak hours. ... still simply too busy. you will wait an hour
-service was good, overall great experience."}
{"text":"5 stars for killer food, amazing ambiance, and a bathroom that is an experience on its own. 

I went here after being recommended by a friend, and seeing the great yelp rating. I knew it was a \"must visit\". By no means did L'Avenue disappoint. I usually do not care for service, unless it is bad, and the great service here really put me at ease (staff speaks both French and English). Ambiance was great, they play nice jazz music during brunch and it helps with the overall enjoyment. Like I said...the bathroom is amazing and made it worth the trip. Make sure you use it. All of these non-food items would give this establishment a 3.5-4 star rating. 

Regarding food. The eggs Benedict seemed to be what everyone was eating. So I do not doubt they are great, but I was specifically told by a friend to \"not be swayed by the eggs Benedict, get the pommes caramelisé\".  I will admit, I was almost swayed... Thank goodness I wasn't. The pommes caramelisé with French toast may have been the best breakfast I have ever had (TOP5DOA). The French toast was airy, and the cheddar and bacon versus the caramel taste was to die for. Please don't be swayed... This meal was the hook line and sinker on the 5 star. 

5 stars for a \"must come back\" restaurant."}
{"text":"I wish I was there every moment of every day of my of life. This place is very much worth the long wait in line. We loved it so much we went twice and almost a 3rd time during our 4 day visit to Montreal. Louise was our waitress and she was absolutely amazing. Such a sweet and actually caring woman!! We had the steak eggs and almost every type of eggs Benedict. Every si for one left me wanting more and wishes for it to just appear in front of me for the rest of the day. And the homefries. Oh the homefries. And the sangria. Oh the sangria. Second best sangria I've had in my life and I swear it's only because there's nothing like having an amazing meal the first time. We also tried the French toast and pancakes and both were good but nothing like those eggs Benedict. Oh and the bathroom. Please go to the bathroom. Just go. L'avenue you have us wishing and dreaming of you every moment of the day. Oh and that dulce de leche whipped cream. My goodness!!!!"}
{"text":"What more can you say that hasn't already been said? This place is serving up huge portions of delicious breakfast items at great prices. Get here early to beat the rush. Be sure to go simple, for example, get the plain pancakes, so you can add as much or as little syrup as you'd like. Otherwise, you may find the dressed plates to be too sweet. The texture of the pancakes is perfect to sop up the maple goodness, the bacon slices are perfectly crisp. I'm still dreaming about our Sunday morning treat.... On Wednesday."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite brunch place in Montreal. I love this restaurant for the creativity they've infused into the simple breakfast foods. I had a french toast egg's benedict and the sweet salty combination was to die for! I would come back in a heartbeat if they could figure out a way to expand- more seating or an outdoor portion would be amazing. This place often has a HUGE line on the weekend (min 1 hour wait) so I would go on a weekday where it's a bit more comfortable. I went on a Tuesday morning and it was still a poppin' place for brunch. What I love about Montreal is you can get a good brunch any day of the week. Party hard play hard right?"}
{"text":"Great server, I believe his name was Jonne, he was very knowledgeable with the menu. The food comes in big portions, reasonably priced. The bathroom was cool too with the lighting and drawings. Great atmosphere, highly recommend going there for brunch."}
{"text":"I LOVED the restaurant atmosphere. 

I've had the benedict a couple times. It tends to be slightly too heavy/rich for my liking, but everyone that I take there seems to love the place. Slow service, but good for a relaxed brunch"}
{"text":"The brunch was great and well enough for a hungry person. Their Americano tastes good. and don't forget to visit the washroom. It is an art room."}
{"text":"Go. It is that simple. This was our last breakfast during a Montreal vacation and was probably the best meal we had. Went during the week and got there around 9ish and there was plenty of seating but by the time we left the place was full. We were only offered French menus even though we only speak English, probably the only negative I had here. Waitstaff was friendly and offered to help us with the menu (they spoke English as well). This place is very fresh fruit oriented so make sure to start with a smoothie or juice of some kind. We didn't really know this and just ordered orange juice but to our delight it was fresh squeezed. I ordered the Eggs Benedict on french toast (had to try it) and the wife ordered pancakes with fresh fruit on top. After a couple minutes I was given a skewer of fresh fruit but my wife wasn't, not really sure why and it wasn't placed in the middle (if I could have read the menu probably would have made sense). 

Eggs Benedict on French Toast = so, so good. Probably the most unhealthy thing I've ever eaten and I loved every bite. I could tell the French Toast was really the star so next time I would probably just get that. One of, if not the best French Toast I've ever had. Comes with real maple syrup.

Pancakes = very good. 

Neat decor and definitely check out the bathroom (really). Would go back here next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I like the foods, the atmosphere and the customer service ,but unfortunately it was not worth to wait for about 1 hour...I know a lot of local people love this restaurant but it was not so special for me as a tourist from NYC."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday morning with a friend and waited ~10 minutes and we were seated. If you're coming with a group of 4 or more though, the wait will probably be over 25 min - id suggest getting there when it opens if you don't want to wait
Very cool decor - nice art on the walls, and the motorcycle hanging from the ceiling is a nice touch. Wouldn't want to be sitting under that though haha. Be sure to check out the bathroom - probably coolest one ive been in 
Now onto the food. The eggs Benedict is so amazing !!! Our waitress recommended the salmon or steak one, but I was really craving mushrooms so I got the one with mushrooms. 
THE best eggs Benedict I've had I'm montreal. So tasty, and the potatoes were also delicious. Really enjoyed the complimentary fruit skewer too - love that they use fresh fruits. 
I recommended the place to some friends and they tried the French toast and pancakes and thought they were delicious as well. 

Delicious food, cool decor, and friendly staff - what's not to love? Will definitely come back often."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast destination, but oh my god the wait.  A well-reviewed hot spot, when joined with a fairly small seating area and the French penchant for slow dining, pretty much guarantees a need for comfortable shoes.  We arrived sometime around 1 PM but didn't get seated until 2 or so, and we were only the 4th group in line (!)  However, I'm pretty sure at some point my hunger had overwhelmed my ability to keep track of time, so for all I knew it was 2 PM the next day by the time we got seated.  I hear Montreal winters are brutal, so I can only imagine the victims of hypothermia dropping dead outside while waiting for their names to be called, but fortunately we were here in late summer when the weather was a bit more tolerable.

Inside, as other reviewers have noted, the decor is indeed pretty cool and kind of defies explanation.  Bits of Americana are strewn about, but also some oddball things like a leather-encases mannequin and bathrooms that...well, let's just say you should check them out.

Portions were quite large and reasonably priced, plus they serve beer here.  I think this must be the first time I've had a pitcher of beer to go with my eggs benedict.  The menu is, as noted, in French, but the wait staff can help out, or you can generally figure out most things.  As a side note, while L'Avenue is known for its breakfasts, particularly its benedicts, they do also offer burgers and other lunch fare on an extensive menu.

One word about the location: L'Avenue is located in the \"Plateau,\" an area which kind of seems like Haight-Ashbury back in our home town.  Lots of boutiques and cool hipster stores, plus they had shut down the main street to autos when we were there, which brought everyone out.  So a pretty cool place for people watching as well.

Great spot, just be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"HIGHLY recommended!!!!!!
Best breakfast i have ever had!!

They start with a free fresh fruit skewer for everyone....yummy
Decorations in the restaurant was very unique & beautiful.
Food was A-W-E-S-O-M-E .... side of potatoes were the best i've ever had.
Everything was delicious! Freshly ground Lavazza coffee for $1.48 (Canadian) unlimited refills!!!!

get there early, lines were out the door after we arrived around 9:30AM on a Tuesday.

Service was also spectacular."}
{"text":"Damn it if it was not one of the better brunch places I have been! Wish this was in my city and not a foreign country!

The portion sizes of more or less everything I saw and ordered a very generous. I ordered the breakfast poutine and my G/F had the smoked meat Benedict. I would certainly recommend ordering the breakfast poutine, but good luck finishing it! It is served in an iron skillet and is cooked to perfection. Most dishes I slowly become sick of and am happy not to finish, this dish i was sad to leave part on my plate. 

The smoked meat Benedict was good as well, smoked meat is not really my thing, but my G/F enjoyed it.

The best surprise with brunch was the appetizer. Unbeknownst to us, each item ordered comes with a fruit skewer which includes a variety of fruit and is a great start to your meal!

The line is pretty insane on weekends and most other days. I would recommend coming early or being ready to wait. I have  noticed actually lines are much more of a thing here, I thought San Francisco was bad, I think Montreal had it beat hands down.

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Waited less than one hour in line.

Food: Had the duck benedict served with breakfast potatoes and fresh fruit. Taste of the duck was okay, I was not accustomed to the caramelised onions that it was cooked with. The poached eggs with grained mustard and hollandaise sauce was on point. The breakfast potatoes (slightly fried?) were addicting, I do not know what combination of herbs and spices they seasoned them with, you can't stop eating them!

Service & atmosphere: Happy-vibe, crowded, loud. I did not know about the washroom before entering, it is very psychedelic inside with the glow in the dark graffiti art (so bring your phone inside!). Near the washroom is a clear water container with sliced watermelons inside, makes the drinking water look aesthetic. I particularly liked the rotating giant maple syrup can.

Price: A bit expensive but this place knows their value."}
{"text":"I love this place and it's worth the 40mins wait on a Saturday at around 10am.  First off, there are 2 glow in the dark washrooms, no joke you'll have to see for yourself.  The water that they give you is tainted with real watermelons.  The $7 milkshake (pineapple & mango) was big and a little too sweet for me, I could do without it.  There was so much to choose from the menu that they made it easy by having the \"Indecisive meal,\" which has 2 free-range eggs served with breakfast potatoes.  A fresh fruit brochette (big long fruit skewer) and the choice of TWO savoury choices of: bacon/homemade cretons/homemade baked beans/beer braised ham/homemade sausage and ONE Sweet choice of: carrot cake/grand marnier cream brulee french toast/smores pancake/nutella strawberry/french toast, for $16.76.  One last thing, the pancakes comes with a can of their famous Montreal syrup, so delicious."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The food is huge an fricken delicious. The menu is huge and full of so many incredible options. The staff is really nice and  accommodating. Even the bathrooms look cool (the walls are covered in black light paint). Just be sure to get here early cause tables go fast."}
{"text":"The only reason people prob like this place is due to the line up making them psychologically thinking it's better than it is. It was a 45 minute wait to get a table then 20 for the server to come take our drink order another 20 to take our order and another 25 for the food to arrive then 20 for the bill to arrive. We met at the line at 11 and left at 2pm... Food was good but nothing special. I'd give it 3 stars if it weren't for the fact that the Busser took groups of 4 and 5 before our group of 3. They said it was because the booth was better for 4 than us 3 tiny girls than sat us at a spacious table for 4 people.  When I went to the bathroom all the booths were 3 people and the booths with 4 were squashed! Then I take off an extra star because me and my friends left feeling nauseous from the food. We all ordered different items, none of us finishing our plates. Probably too much fat."}
{"text":"great breakfast!!! I LOVE IT.... 

patatoes amazing... pancakes amazing!!! yum

not amazing for supper... but good for breakie."}
{"text":"Okay, we saw the long line on a Sunday morning and, unfortunately, decided to go to the other brunch place across the street where we had so-so food and mediocre service.  So we came back the next morning, on Monday, to eat Restaurant l'avenue. This time we were able to get a table with no wait.  

And boy, it was worth the extra effort to dine here: my curried eggs benedict was one of the best things I have ever eaten for breakfast.  The baked goods were top notch and the service was charming (and beautiful).  

If you are over 40, come here and discover what the young generation of Montreal is all about: educated, urbane, worldly, flirty, and interested in innovative cuisine.  The experience will take a decade off your age.  

Restaurant l'avenue is the place for brunch in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I would never wait in line to eat here, yet there are always massive line-ups in front of this place. The food is OK, as in it's as good as breakfast food in any decent restaurant in the city. The experience is what sets this place apart, catering to fans of eclectic, boisterous atmospheres.

Last time I visited, service was painfully slow and not particularly remarkable. 

It may be worth checking out for the overall experience, but I'd definitely go somewhere else if there's a wait to get in!"}
{"text":"Eggs benedict: CHECK
Nutella coffee: CHECK
Washroom selfie: CHECK

5 Stars. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service. Amazing food. We should NOT all have ordered separate breakfast- the portions were OUTRAGEOUSLY huge. But it was worth it to try different things. We arrived at 8:30 which was great. By the time we left the line was halfway down the street."}
{"text":"Me my girlfriend and my best friend decide it to go eat at l'avenue on Notre-Dame at Montreal. When we got to the restaurant, there was a line to go in there. We waited for 30min before we got our table. We got our menu when we got our table and a few moment later we got our water which is great as we didn't need to request for it and at the same time she ask us if we want it coffee and we all accepted. The coffe was good but I am not a black coffee taste person so a normal flavor coffee would be fine since I had cream and sugar. We all order Milkshakes and 2 of us got a shot of espresso in it, I got choco-banana milkshake and the other 2 got oreo biscuit milkshake. 

The waitress were friendly. They took our order where we all order different egg benedict, I took steak & egg benedict, my girlfriend took Montreal benedict smoked meat and my friend got Saint-Ambroisse Benedict. It was really delicious and we got our plate fast too. We even got a small entree of fruit to start off and there was a few mix of different fruit to eat.

The only thing why i would reduce one star it's because the time we waited for our table, before we could order and to get our bills. But it's understandable has there was a lot of customer and a lot of people came to eat there. I would recommend the place. It wasn't too noisy and the environment was good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Montreal for 5 days and after coming for Brunch on our 3rd day, we were back the next!

Restaurant L'avenue is literally the best brunch place I have ever been to. I'm serious.
I tried the Eggs Benedict, which was good, however, I forgot to order it with ham and got a brisket type meat instead which I was less fond of.

The second time I got a combo of eggs, ham, bagel, fruit skewer, and potatoes and fell in love. It's everything I've ever wanted in brunch.

My boyfriend got the blueberry, banana, strawberry french toast both times and when I asked him what I should write he enthusiastically said, \"Best f***ing french toast I've ever had... twice.\"

The staff is super friendly and speak both French & English, and the place is very trendy. (Check out the black-lit washroom!) There was a line both times but the wait isn't too long and well worth the wait. 

100% recommended. Go Go Go!"}
{"text":"The holy grail of Montreal brunch spots. They close at 4 so make sure you get in before last call. If you are a table of 2 you will be seated much quicker. 

The entire menu is amazing. I personally recommend the french toast with caramelized bananas in captains morgan rum, imported italian nutella and coconut sauce. It was delicious and perfect for a sweet tooth. 

The bobby does dallas with eggs, steak, shrooms, and onions was delicious. The bbq sauce was not over powering, and the dish was savoury. 

The coffee is bottomless, and the water is watermelon infused. 

Take a selfie in the glow in the dark bathroom. Very unique for a brunch spot like this."}
{"text":"Très bon rapport qualité/prix... nous y sommes aller a l ouverture ce qui a permis d eviter la looooooongue attente que je vois chaque fois que je passe devant ahahaha. Donc le conseil c est d y aller a l ouverture ou d etre patient :)"}
{"text":"This place is a little overrated and not necessarily worth the long waits that often happen on the weekends but- there is no other place quite like this. It's a bit pricey but the selection of food is insane and they have some of the best eggs Benedict in town! My fave is the one with wild mushrooms, bacon, garlic reduction & creamy reduction sauce! The milkshakes are also incredible, especially the imported Nutella & raspberry one!! It's so fresh and delicious omg!! But this place is pretty expensive and on some days the food isn't as good as others.. But everyone should go at least once for sure!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what got into me the day I declared this place the best brunch I had ever had because a year after going there for the first time my experience didn't compare at all the second time.

The portions are generous but the food is not subtle and tends to gross me out a little.

I was so surprised by how disappointed I was going back but I guess in the meantime I came across much tastier and extraordinary brunch places that just made this one look really pale in comparison.

The eggs Benedict had way too much hollandaise and the Nutella pancakes were just too sweet and without any subtlety.

You might love it like I did the first time, but you might also be truly disappointed if you like more sophisticated food."}
{"text":"Always a line up. Big expectation. Big let down. Super loud club like music. Hipster wanna be hangout. Ok food. We were very happy to leave! That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"As someone who loves brunch (brunch is my favorite meal, hands down), this is by far, the best brunch I have ever had.

They have brunch on weekdays and weekends - the restaurant is open from 8 to 4 and my group of 6 went around 10:30-11 and it was already a 1-1.5 hour wait for us. While on line, I kept thinking that it was not going to be worth it or that I was just setting myself up for disappointment. But no, it was everything I wanted in a brunch.

I ordered the chorizo benedict and it was amazing. I don't even know how to describe it other than amazing. It was the perfect combination of flavors. I had a bite of my friend's French toast and it was the best French toast I have ever had - it was crunchy and soft at the same time like I don't know how that was possible.

Do not order the strawberry raspberry drink. It's in a lot of photos because it's cute and pink, but it is VERY overpowering with basil. I was not a fan. I think their drinks are not as great as their food.

Decor is very interesting - lots of graffiti (especially neon-colored in the bathrooms - take photos!) and bikes decorating the wall. Service was AMAZING. Given that there's a LONG wait outside, I somewhat expected to be rushed. But they did not rush at ALL. They were so patient. Food came out quickly. The waitress was very helpful and answered all of our questions.

Definitely worth the wait if you're in town. I'm not sure if I would suggest going at 8 AM cause this is a LARGE meal to be eating that early in the morning, but you could go that early if you're super hungry and want to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! I had the chorizo Benedict's it was finger licking good!!!! The service was great and the atmosphere is lively. This place is a must in Montreal"}
{"text":"Maybe the best brunch of my life.

7 of us on New Year's eve around 2:30pm.  Waited for 15 - 20 minutes.  Had the steak and eggs benedict, banana and nutella pancakes and french toast w/ berries and bananas.  HIGHLY recommend the pancakes.  Fluffy and smothered with melty nutella and syrupy bananas along with a cup full of caramel sauce on the side that is AMAZING.  The shakes are huge and maybe too sweet."}
{"text":"We came here based on the great yelp reviews since we were looking for a new breakfast place to try. The first minus was a huge wait, we stood in the line for about 45 minutes. I don't mind the wait if the food is good. The second minus was that they don't have any English languague menus, so we had to rely on the recommendation from the staff. The final minus was the food. Not sure if it was just a bad day, but the food was not seasoned at all. There was no salt, pepper or any other seasoning in their food. We ordered duck confit omelet, and eggs benedict. Nothing was good, and definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place.This was my very first meal in Montreal. Brunch was bomb. We ordered the classic eggs Benedict & berry French toast. The portions were huge, food & drinks were delicious, prices were good and the decor was adorable. We missed the rush b/c we went around 8 am but I definitely would've waited in line for this place."}
{"text":"Hands down.. One of the best eggs benedicts i have had so far! I really liked their hollandaise sauce. Perfectly creamy and not too heavy or greasy and not too salty, either. I had the one with goat cheese, spinach and mushroom. The goat cheese was an excellent part that was harmonized with other ingredients! I have to mention that their potato was nicely cooked as well. It was chewy in a good way and they were delicious! 

Also, I ordered a soy cappuccino which was very awesome! :)

Another good part is that they have free wifi without any password. 

The service was mediocre though.. My fruit salad was not served until I mentioned it. (The people who sat right next to me and who seemed local had better service than I had.)

Anyways, it's a great place for breakfast or brunch. I would like to come back with my friends!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite brunch spot in Montreal and the opinion seems to be shared with the many people willing to wait in lines for it. It's particularly busy in the weekends, even you get there early for brunch. Their Benedicts are what makes me come back everytime. Definitely a must for breakfast and brunch lovers. The place is quirky and modern, the vibe is upbeat, the food is amazing and in huge portions and the people are very friendly. What else can you ask for? If you want something that best represent what Montreal is, dont miss it."}
{"text":"If you're going to do brunch in Montreal, you should go to L'Avenue located in Plateau Mont-Royal. Now, there will be a line outside, and you'll have to deal with it...but, you probably won't wait more than 20 minutes or so. Inside, the wall is covered in fun graffiti and a motorcycle hanging from the ceiling (don't worry, it won't fall if you're sitting under it...hopefully). The music also makes the environment, the playlists are fun, with good energy.

If you're an Eggs Benedict fan, this is the place for you, they have a wide variety of Benedicts to choose from. I figured they knew how to make a great crepe too, so, I went for the Whole Wheat Crepe with cinnamon baked apples and cottage cheese. Each dish is also served with their signature fresh fruit skewers. The crepe was delicious, light and had lots of flavor. The skewers are the perfect accompaniment as well, fresh and perfectly portioned. 

And of course, real Maple Syrup.

Oh, and whether you need to use the bathroom or not, you have to go inside (yes, it's black lit). Best party bathroom. Ever."}
{"text":"L'avenue has great food and strong command for interior design but less than acceptable customer service. Sadly as a New Yorker I was less than satisfied with the host on a Monday afternoon. He gave me a dirty look as I snapped some photo's of the interior and asked me if he could help me as if it was unusual for someone to be photographing the great art on the walls. I ordered a quick smoothie to go and on the way out he walked over the me at told me to be \"smooth with the photo's.\" I'm less then impressed with this kind of RUDE hospitality and have to warn others that it's NOT the most inviting of restaurants to visit.  If anything they would want to encourage publicizing the space, right?"}
{"text":"Love the decor! Very popish and eclectic, L'avenue is definitely a hot spot for brunch. Situated in the beautiful Mont Royal street the morning walk there is already a treat. However, there is often a long line in front of the place. Be ready to wait while you dream of fresh mimosas!"}
{"text":"L'Avenue mérite bien son titre de THE spot pour bruncher à Montréal! J'ai pris les ufs brouillés à la truffe. Malgré une portion \"à l'américaine\" (comprenez : impossible à terminer), c'était vraiment délicieux. La déco est sympa et le service très attentif. Allez faire un tour dans les toilettes, elles valent vraiment le coup!"}
{"text":"Indeed, there is a heaven in this world. 
I had wanted to visit the place a loong loong time and recently I did. I was mad at myself for not trying it out sooner. 
If you walk down the street it is practically a hidden gem, not shouting out loud: \"Hi theeere, here we aaare!\" Which I liked. 

The place serves mostly breakfast meals but it is not a rule as there are things like hamburgers as well. But since I visited the place I have to say the word \"breakfast\" has a totally new meaning for me. 

I ordered pancakes with nutella, bananas, coconut sauce with a sprinkle of rum. I have to tell you (and I swear) that I have never ever had a better breakfast and a pancake before in my entire life!

But that was before I tried the omelette with a ham, champignons, red onion and pepper (I believe so) my boyfriend ordered. My oh my, never ever have I had such a piece of paradise in my mouth before. Not even the pancakes. 

We also ordered home made squeezed pineapple juice which was amazing and the watermelon water was a blast as well. 

All that for an amazing price since the portions were so huge we had to take out the rest. So basically I had the pancakes for lunch that day, a dinner later and a breakfast the next day. All that for $38 for both of us. And the staff was so nice we left them the biggest tip we have ever left so far - $15. And I still thought it was not enough because they work hard like hell to accommodate all your taste buds and breakfast eating habits.  

The only downside of the place is that they do not have an english version of the menu. Google translator - God bless you! Even so I am giving the place 5*/5*. And believe me, if I could, I would give the place 6* out of those 5*. 
Have not had a better dining experience in a very loong time."}
{"text":"unique taste you won't get in any other brunch place! worth the waiting in the snow for 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot! Run, don't walk there. If there's a line, wait patiently - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After having breakfast at the hotel, a bunch of friend we were with decided to have brunch. I guess most of them had missed the hotel breakfast. I had hoped to go with the lunch menu to get a sandwich or something like that, but after sitting down we found out that they don't do the lunch menu on weekends. The only other thing that was inconvenient was that there was a really long wait, which was a bit frustrating. But this place did have some great breakfast...

Some of the biggest fluffiest pancakes I've ever seen. The menu was all in French, so that made it a bit difficult. I didn't realize crepes were pancakes until we asked the waiter. He was super-helpful with options and so forth. So the pancakes came with this nice creamy syrup on top plus maple syrup on the side. They were also topped generously with fruits. Oh, that's one thing at L'Avenue... there are TONS of fresh fruits. You get an entire plateful of this fruit kebab when you first sit down - that was pretty cool. With all the sugary goodness going around, I really enjoyed my order of savory breakfast potatoes with my order. That balanced all meal out for me. I could only finish two of those pancakes... I strongly advise sharing for people who visit this place as the portions are enormous.

Would definitely recommend for a big hearty breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB. I agree with other reviews - this place is the best place to go for brunch in the WORLD, not just Montreal. It would be rather difficult to top my experience here. 

L'avenue can probably persuade you to move to Montreal. My brunch visit hit the spot and was so good I still remember my first bite of the Monte Cristo, I'd probably drive six hours just to eat here. I'm so glad I did my research before visiting this city, otherwise I wouldn't have lined up to try out L'Avenue. The line-up could be discouraging to some, but it's worth the wait! Your stomach will thank you after! 

The Monte Cristo is two pieces of French toast (crispy on the edges) that weren't too eggy nor soggy on the inside, sandwiching Swiss cheese and ham. Then this is drizzled in maple syrup, and comes with a side of home fries or salad. This was the best I've tasted ANYWHERE. Portions are also enormous for the price! 

Service is also fantastic! We didn't speak any French, and the servers were equally as nice to us, explaining in detail what was in the menu. 

I'm already planning my next Montreal trip, and this time I hope to have brunch here more than once! I still gotta try their eggs benedict, omeletes, chorizio sausage... *drooling*  

I'm their #1 Fan!"}
{"text":"Brunch hot spot!!! A minimum 30min wait on the weekend, and make sure your whole party is there by the time you get to the front or else they won't sit you down.  

We were four for sunday brunch, and all of us were happy with our choices. The portions were quite large and none of us were able to eat more then half the plate. Doggy bag! They offer a lot of choice when it comes to food. Finally I had the omelet with goat cheese, which I was happy with. 

Definitely worth a visit, but if you don't like waiting in line ups, better go during the week."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Can't go wrong, but the pancakes and chorizo Benedict are always amazing."}
{"text":"Show up early (9 am) to get a table more quickly, because the wait will become very long...but oh, is it worth it...

This is the best brunch I've had in Montreal so far. The french toast was the best I've ever had, and their famous eggs benedict truly did meet my expectations. The real star of the eggs benedict dish however was their breakfast potatoes. 

I still dream about the Banana Nutella Pancakes. Three huge banana pancakes smothered in nutella and showered in toasted coconut and caramelized bananas with a rum sauce. Absolutely to die for. 

Overall, Atmosphere was great, service was attentive and friendly, and the bathroom makes for some sweet selfies ;)"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited Montréal for thanksgiving break and we heard many great things about this place through yelp. So we decided to give it a shot but we stood in line for an hour or so in below freezing weather. That was terrible but thank god that was the only part. Once all that was over, the good stuff happens. 

The food came very quickly and the service was really friendly. Every plate comes with a side of fresh fruit so that was very pleasant. The entire restaurant gave off a very chill and ambient vibe, I loved it. 

The portions were HUGE but our party of 4 wolfed down everything! I ordered eggs Benedict and one of my friends ordered the steak eggs Benedict. Omg those were the best egg Benedict's I've ever had, no joke. They were delicious! 

We also ordered the Nutella bananas French toast for us to share and it was such a sweet way to end our meal!  

After we all ended up in food comas but it was one of the best brunch places I've ever been to. When visiting Montreal, this place is an absolute must!"}
{"text":"I thought breakfast could only be so good, that there was a threshold..... I was wrong. The huevos rancheros here are the best I've ever had, I went two days in a row during my 3 days in mtl and I wish I could've gone more. Most perfectly seasoned potatoes I've ever had. I could DEFINITELY go on but suffice it to say, I will mourn this place when I go back to New York. Do yourself a favor and come here!!"}
{"text":"Best brunch place in montreal during our visit. We went on mother's day, so can't comment on how long the wait really is on a regular day. The classic benedict was so tasty, probably the best ham benedict I've had. It isn't Canadian back bacon, but some type of pulled ham with a sweet honey-like sauce. We also tried the smoked meat benedict, but it wasn't as good (meat was bland). 

Must try their smoothies, they are as big as a baby's head and so delicious. You might want to share. There hot chocolate was pretty good as well. 

Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This was the first time that I came to the Avenue in st-Henri instead of the Plateau one. There was about a 20-30 mins wait time which wasn't too bad.

The food was good, I took the egg Benedict with wild mushrooms and my boyfriend took the Bobby goes to Spain. I definitely recommend the egg Benedict section. The portions are huge.

I'm giving a 4 star just because the waiter knew that I got a birthday free meal but instead of communicating with his manager , I had to remind him several times. I understand that it was a busy day but instead of responding to me with the bill with both meals priced, \" sorry let me correct that or follow up with my manager\", he said \"the manager needs to approve it\". At that time, the manager has already approved it since we were seated. That's my only feedback that I could give for improvement. Otherwise the restaurant was great!"}
{"text":"This place is always a go to whenever I'm in Montreal. Service is great and food is consistently great. Not to mention they offer watermelon flavoured water! Portion sizes are really large for the price. Go early as there's always a line and they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Great????
Wait for one hours, but it's worthy?every thing is delicious?
The decoration in the washroom is very special?"}
{"text":"A fun place for brunch - just kidding unless you count waiting in line for 30-45 min fun. the food is over-the top good but I've abandoned grocery carts after shopping when there's too much of a line up at the cash so I can't - in good conscious - recommend this place.  Brunch is brunch is brunch and Montreal has no shortage of places that serve up a mean eggs Benedict..."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place three stars because I saw many reviews on this place and saw it had made a few TV shows,so I went as a first timer with very high expectations. 

However after waiting one hour (in the rain, no less), I was extremely disappointed. The coolest part about the entire restaurant was the decor and I do not mean the bathroom! 

The menu is based on TV game shows which is a cute theme, but the food was only, dare I say, just ok. It was by far the most mediocre breakfast/brunch food that I have ever had in my life and I have traveled and eaten in many parts of the United States and many other countries. 

The waiter was slightly pleasant but he also seemed a bit rushed and irritable and when we asked questions about the menu. The smoothies looked good, but did not try one since the food was not very impressive.

The prices were high especially for the food, service and the long wait. I would not recommend waiting hour in line to eat here, especially in the rain and hate that I did so. I did appreciate that they brought umbrellas out to us so we would not get so wet. I'm not sure why they have such high ratings, perhaps me and my party ordered the wrong food,  but in any case I will not be returning."}
{"text":"MEILLEUR BRUNCH (du monde?), HANDS DOWN.

J' ai vecu trois ans sur l'avenue Mont Royal et j'ai teste presque tous les brunchs de la rue (meme du quartier!), aucun n'arrive a la cheville de l'Avenue en terme de qualite/quantite/prix!

Absolument tout y est excellent: les brunchs sales ou sucres - montagne de pancakes moelleux aux fruits et sirop d'erable - , les hambourgois -celui au steak Kobe ou au fromage bleu, hmmm- , les smoothies servis dans des verres enormes, et surtout les frites parfaitement assaisones a l'ail.
Tout ca dans des quantites assez gargantuesques, j'ai d'ailleurs pris l'habitude de prendre un doggy bag pour mon diner!
Cerise sur le gateau, ce n'est pas tres cher: assiette de brunch (qui me fait aussi office de diner, donc) a partir de $8 par exemple.

le decor est hyper special, mais agreable et il faut absolument faire un tour aux toilettes!

Bref, c'est une adresse qui me donne la nostalgie de Montreal.

Une Valeur Sure."}
{"text":"We loved our breakfast here! Perfect! Everything was delicious and fresh. The smoothies are awesome. My husband went nuts over the Nutella coffee...
The service was fantastic."}
{"text":"A party of 4 waited ~20 mins on a random Monday (ok, it was Memorial Day Monday, but we're in Canada!) for L'avenue -- and I'd gladly wait an hour for this place!

We were seated in a cozy booth near the back, and as I walked by I stared at all the food on everyone's table. First thought: YUM. Second thought: HUGE! I was delighted!

The menu is all in French, but our waiter was more than happy to translate for us. We all started off with a mango-pineapple-lychee concoction ($7, but sooo big) and ordered a variety of Egg Benedicts - their specialty!

Unlike most of the restaurants we ate at during our time in Montreal, the food didn't take forever to come out. The presentation was simple but the food was amazing! My chorizo egg bennie's yolk was perfectly runny and the chorizo added a bit of spice to the meal. The highlight of the dish was definitely the potatoes! Perfectly seasoned and soft - I could eat those as my entire meal! My gf's bennies weren't runny though :( However, L'avenue will gladly make you another one so make sure you tell 'em!

The huge fruit skewers that came with every entree was a great refreshing treat. I'm talking chunks of watermelon, grapefruit, banana, pineapple - the works! 

The BEST part of L'avenue though, has to be their crazy black light bathrooms. MUST SEE! Love this placeee :)"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to like this place a lot more than I did because of the reviews. Let me explain...

We got there on a weekday, about 15 mins post opening so we are able to get a seat no problem. The decorations were pretty awesome and they served water infused with watermelon (mmmm tasty). We looked at the menu and ordered. Here's where it started to go downhill....

Each meal does come with fruit kebab which was good. But we waited SOOO LONG for our food. From ordering to getting our food, it was about 45 mins I'd say. They might've been understaff, and I think I only saw 3 chefs in the kitchen, which granted, is not many for how many people were in the restaurant. But I wasn't expecting to wait that long, especially from a restaurant that is highly reviewed. 

I got the chicken eggs Benedict and the eggs Benedict itself was very good. But the chicken was so dry and tasteless. I ate everything but the chicken. My boyfriend got the carrot cake pancakes which was yummy but very heavy. 

I will say the bathrooms are quite awesome. Definitely check it out. Would I come here again next time I'm in Montreal? Final verdict is I would want to give it another try...since it is so highly rated."}
{"text":"Je suis triste -  I wish L'Avenue was in Toronto.  

We came here at around 10:30am, arriving to a lineup of roughly 8-10 people ahead of us, which moved relatively quickly (maybe a 15 minute wait, at max?).  Appreciated that despite the short wait, there's a cooler with ice water available at the front of the line for any overheated guests waiting for a table. 

Which takes me to the next point: seemingly superfluous details are far from lost.  Himalayan pink salt sits in the table salt shakers instead of regular ol' stinky salt.  Water inside comes from a huge, clear plastic cube dispenser, with whole rounds of watermelon floating inside to flavour the water.  Cafe latte glacee, which I thought would simply be caffe latte poured over ice, actually came in a large glass and blended, like an iced capp but much less sweet. 

A free skewer of fresh fruit will serve as your appetizer, regardless of whatever dish you might've ordered. 

My pick for the day was the eggs Benedict \"Tout L'Monde a Poele\": Two huge mounds of sautéed mushrooms, bacon on English muffins topped with two poached eggs. Sadly, a couple of our eggs were overcooked. 

The hubs had the eggs Benedict with the truffle...before I ate the tiny bit of black truffle shavings on top, because I'm a monster like that.  

The hollandaise, while I have to admit wasn't the best I've had, was also not the worst - it actually tasted of butter. 

Both bennys were delicious. 

My tips:
- Menus are in French, I'm not sure whether or not they have English menus available.  If this puts you off, I suggest reading their menu online so you can Google in advance. 
- If French is not your forte, when greeted by waitstaff, make sure you reply in English.  If you answer in French, be prepared to speak French the rest of the time you're there. 
- Come early-ish! Pretty much anything past 11 and you're in line for the long haul. 

Portions are large, so warm up your belly before you come here.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Waited 1hr first visit.  45 minutes on 2nd visit.

Well worth the wait on both visits!!!

Great quality, great selection, good price, cool decor and fine service.  This is a must-go restaurant for Montreal even if you don't usually do brunch.  They have so much good stuff, it's sure to please everyone.  (unless you insist on asian breakfast, but come on...)

My advice.  Get a sacrificial friend to wait in line for the group.  Go big on your order, and order adventurously.  Don't try to play it safe with just egg benedict.  Get their house sausage.  Get their french toast.  Get their signature dishes (Johnny goes to Spain, etc.)."}
{"text":"Even the longest wait for the most amazing breakfast / brunch you'll ever have in all of Montréal is totally worth. They don't take reservations at the L'Avenue, but they do serve you well, once you get seated. Always crowded on weekends (and special occasions like Mother's Day) I will try the place during the week next time to enjoy the crazy good smoothies and great variety of traditional as well as exotic breakfast sets. Egg Benedict in any variation is out of this world, fruit skewers are served before any other dish and the variety of drinks pleases even the most choosy palate. Can't wait to get back there."}
{"text":"Super accueil malgré l'attente on se sent très bien en entrant !
Menu très varié, prix corrects.
Bon, c'est mega copieux alors faites gaffe en commandant si vous ne voulez pas en laisser dans l'assiette !"}
{"text":"Protip -- Try to get here before 11-11:30 to avoid the god awful line. We arrived around 10:30am and were seated right away. When we walked passed the restaurant at 12pm again, there was a pretty long line outside the restaurant.
 
L'Avenue is a diner-like restaurant similar to Jackson Hole in New York City. They have a pretty unique decor around the restaurant. Before the entree comes out they give you fruit skewers to start off your meal. It was a nice refreshing way to start off your meal especially with the watermelon-infused water. I got to try the Smoked meat eggs benedict -- AKA pastrami eggs benedict. The smoked meat was so tender and flavorful, it had me savoring for more. The dish also came with home fries that were seasoned perfectly. I also tried the french toast that came loaded with berries & fruits on top. It was also very delicious, especially when you drizzle it with the canadian maple syrup that they provide you in a can. 

Portions are huge so come in ready to eat! Excellent brunch spot for sure."}
{"text":"It is eye-candy here. The food is really tasty but either I eat too much or the portions are huge but I always leave feeling super FULL. Worth a trip - especially for those visiting montreal!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough amazing things about the classic Eggs Benny, by far the best Eggs Benedict I have ever had. Classic Eggs Benedict usually comes with typical processed cold-cut ham. However at L'Avenue they have a beautiful, succulent slow cooked, glazed shredded ham that they put on the Eggs Benny, which makes it out of this word yummy. 

I opted for the gluten free option (which offers either gluten free bread of Eggs Benny on portabello mushrooms), the gluten free bread was quite yummy and did not take away from the taste factor of the eggs benny. I also had an americano style coffee, which was also exceptionally good. 

Overall I would definitely return to this place, but would caution fellow yelpers about the potentially long line. I went around 9:30am on a Saturday and the place already had a huge line up outside, however it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! It is worth the wait.  Great food, drinks, and service.  Bathroom is awesome too"}
{"text":"So amazing! What an awesome brunch experience. Typical of Montreal brunch places, we waited ~30 minutes for a table. It was a Saturday morning, typical brunch time, so that was nothing unexpected. The first thing we noticed was the menu. The designs and names were so quirky and cute! I got the nutella latte, which tasted exactly how you'd think it would taste. Caffeinating and chocolatey, perfect for a Saturday brunch. I love duck, so it was obviously the duck benedict for me. The indécis is perfect for anyone who doesn't know what to get! I saw a tip saying it was better to ask for the pancakes on the side, which is what we did. A definite bonus: the filter coffee is both unlimited and cheap! Overall amazing brunch with fantastic drinks, main dishes, and side dishes (those potatoes though omg). 5 stars well earned."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE IN MONTREAL! cool and funky! The food was amazing, so many choices. You get a fruit skewer and bread with your meal. Super friendly staff! Great environment! The music was also perfect. We waited 10 minutes for a group of 7 without a reservation. Highly recommend this place!!!! When you go be sure to check out the bathrooms!!"}
{"text":"L'Avenue is my new favorite brunch spot. My girlfriend and I took a trip up to montreal and this was one of our many stops. Being a New Yorker, we've been to plenty of brunch locations and this place tops it all. The food is delicious and as much as I hate waiting on line, the wait was well worth it. I had the crab cake eggs benedict, that was delicious! I forget what my girlfriend had but I do remember her saying how good it was. Must try place if you're in montreal or coming to visit!"}
{"text":"Every weekend a group of us Mcgillers would take a break from studying (pffftt right) to go for brunch. We found a handful of favorites, but this was #1. 

The only downside to this place are the huge lines for weekend brunch. It's no secret how good this place is.

Their eggs benedict dishes are the best to be found, anywhere. The chorizo is deadly as is the spinach and goat cheese. The potatoes, which are dripping with butter, garlic and rosemary are legendary. 

Artsy, hipster interior with fast service.

This is one of the many things I miss about Montreal."}
{"text":"One of the coolest brunch places! Come early, the line is out the door. The menu is AWESOME! It's huge and offers anything your brunching heart desires. I got the beautiful truffle dish and it was excellent. Shoutout to their coffee game too, because it's on point. When you order a bowl of coffee, you actually get a bowl of coffee and man is it ever good. Also, the dishes all come with a fruit plate which is a great touch. Staff is awesome too! But like I said, get here EARLY and/or be prepared to wait, but it's 100% worth it."}
{"text":"Great food for dinner. Did not like breakfast because i was too full but maybe it depends on what you choose on the menu. Friendly staff, Interesting decoration."}
{"text":"3rd time is a charm, seems to be the case when attempting to eat at L-Avenue. It took me my 3rd trip to Montreal to finally find a line small enough for me to make it inside and have a good meal!

Overall, i liked the meal. The crab cake benedict was very good. The salad it comes with is pretty much a waste, there is nothing special about it. The hollandaise sauce was perfect, but unique too. maybe there was cheese in it? not sure what the description said but it was a nice touch. the crab cakes were the perfect size, but i feel needed less bread crumbs. the potatoes seemed simple at first, but they truly  grew on me. overall, service was good and i liked the meal. 

major props to this place,for having the most amazing bathroom ever."}
{"text":"Simply, the best breakfast spot in Montreal! This place have it all food, service, decor. Do not leave without trying the frenchtoast. Too many reviewer are speaking about it as a brunch place as well, I never tried it but I am pretty sure it will excel. Count for a waiting line, it would be really annoying in winter."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite breakfast spot in all of Montrèal and totally worth the wait out in the cold. Excessively large portions of food that you can't finish in a single sitting make it a great brunch spot after a long night out. Everything I have ever tried here strikes a perfect balance between gourmet and comfort food. The service is a bit slow because the place is jam packed, so don't plan on a breakfast."}
{"text":"Watch out guys, there will be a line! And boy, is it worth the wait. The decor is funky starting from the ski wall to the menu and the psychedelic paintings in the bathroom. The portion size is huge, I actually should have shared my breakfast. The menu selection is huge. Oh and if you like eggs Benedict, there is an entire menu page dedicated to eggs Benedict. I got the Bobby does Texas or something, potatoes with tender steak and BBQ sauce with scrambled eggs on top, it was REaLLY good! I also got a blueberry and basil mimosa, so delicious and the coffee was phenomenal! I will return!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is soso. Spinach, pineapple mango smoothie is delicious. My plate was supposed to come with a crepe and got a pancake instead. Waiter didn't mention that a switch of meat was extra. We tipped him well and he barely looked at us or thanked us. Almost ran away once we paid. Bathrooms are cool but look a bit icky. Also, they shouldn't be cleaning the tables while you're eating. A waitress was spritzing cleaning product onto the table next to us while we were eating. Some tables are so close one to the other that you can't lift your elbows too high by fear of hitting the person next to you."}
{"text":"Literally the best breakfast I've ever had. They put there water in with freshly sliced watermelon so it has a slight watermelon flavor it's delicious and very refreshing. I got the steak Benedict  it was incredible perfectly cooked steak the hollandaise had a kick and was out of this world. My gf got a spinach and goat cheese Benedict of some kind, completely different hollandaise then mine but very delicious as well we got pancakes as well and the syrup they had was awesome. I lived the vibe of this place ,music and decor was awesome.  There was a large line but def worth the wait."}
{"text":"An excellent place to brunch and have a great breakfast. Totally filling. I had the truffled eggs on toasted brioche with mushrooms and it was YUMMY. 

There's always a line and I had walked by thinking: My goodness the food must be good and cheap!

I was not disappointed. I'd love to go back and try their Eggs Benedict or basically anything on their menu (except Crepes.. I can eat those at home).

SO SO SO good.

Menu is only in French, the receipt was kind of weird, it looked like I had already paid (?) and I was full at the end which is saying something (I usually need two breakfasts' to feel full)

Oh.. and the bathrooms are very cool. Totally surprised me and caught me off guard when I visited. Wear white for a max effect ;)"}
{"text":"Visited this location long before I was using yelp and I loved it so I was happy to have the chance to go again. First time I experienced a huge line up but it was a nice Sunday afternoon so lots of people out for brunch. This time it was lunch time, middle of the week and also raining.

The staff is beyond friendly and very efficient event under pressure. The place is very hip and decoration is crazy cool but the music can be loud at times so if you are looking for a quiet spot this might not be the place for you.

The menu is very huge and everything I tried was amazing but the best part is the watermelon water they serve it is tasty and so refreshing. I had breakfast and lunch there and both options did not disappoint me.

Price are fairly good and the extremely cool bathroom makes it worth while. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"J'ai gardé un trèèèèès bon souvenir des smoothies! Un vrai délice, sans parler des plats de brunch. Un régal! 
Le seul hic: sa popularité! Effectivement, on ne sera pas étonnés de voir une longue file d'attente sur le trottoir, à attendre qu'une table se libère, tout en salivant devant les plats que les clients déjà aisément installés se font servir!
La salle mériteraient à s'agrandir étant donné le succès que connait la place, mais en même temps, ce n'est pas en voyant une longue file d'attente dans la rue qui attire la clientèle?! Hum... Stratégie ;)"}
{"text":"This place is A++
If you want to go to a trendy place with amazing food, this is where you want to go. The whole deco and vibe of the place is great, and very insta worthy (especially the bathroom!!!! So don't forget to go \"pee\" and take a picture). As for the food, the plates are huge, and food is delicious! If you like eggs benedict, then just go for them because honestly they're super good. Oh and btw, there's a little bit of a wait so try and get there at a good time, nonetheless, the queue goes by quite fast so not much to worry about. L'avenue is 100% recommended"}
{"text":"Decent brunch place but I don't get the hype though. For this price you can get good brunch at a lot of other places in Montreal. The decor definitely does not do justice to Montreal brunch vibes - its rather basic. Definitely not worth the 1 hour wait in line."}
{"text":"Don't go here for breakfast! This place is so awesome - I want it all to myself! If you do go try one of the Eggs Benedict plates. They are to die for. I had the Chorizo II plate this morning and it was fab. A friend had the Eggs Benedict meets French Toast and it was like a angel sitting on my tongue. 

The portions are huge. Don't be afraid to share. 

Oh, and the reports of the restaurant being overrun by hipsters are greatly exaggerated."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for brunch/breakie. Only a couple of things holding it back from a 5 star rating but I'll get to that at the end. 

Lots of items to choose, but most should head to the extensive Benedicts selection. I chose the Coin Coin Benedictine, the one with the delicious duck confit. Couldn't be happier with this dish. Healthy portions, tender duck underneath nicely made poached eggs. The roasted potatoes weren't burnt or too salty. I was well satiated afterwards. 

So what were the knocks? Coffee was subpar compared to other Montreal brunch spots and the service was hit or miss. Our server seated us without menus but the food arrived promptly. 

Overall, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ambience: 2/5  (Crowded)

{"text":"J'y suis finalement retournée il y a 2 semaines pour être très très déçue :( Mon amie et moi avons toutes les deux retourné nos assiettes d'oeufs bénédictines, car la sauce goûtait juste le vinaigre (c'est la première fois de ma vie que je retourne un plat!). J'ai recommandé le même plat mais sans sauce, et c'était bon mais rien de spécial. Je pense que cet endroit est vraiment \"over-hyped\" pour rien, ce n'est pas si fabuleux que ça, et il y a pleins d'autres places de brunch à Montréal."}
{"text":"I normally don't yelp on places out of town but I just have add my 5 star review. One of the easiest 5 stars for me. Either that or I take a star or two off all the Toronto brunch places I have rated in because l'avenue puts them all to shame.

The Benedictine was just... Wow. Best I've had. Every aspect of the dining experience was just better than anything I've had here. Dining space, a lot bigger, food quality, service, serving size, you name it, it's better. I got the version with chorizo which was great, but had a taste of the classic with pulled pork which was even more outstanding. Even the side of potatoes the benny came with was really good.  

I can imagine this place being ridiculous at peak hours though because we went on a Wednesday morning and it was almost packed. Which wouldn't be a lot different to the brunch places in Toronto which you'll line up for for an hour and get just ok food and cramped dining."}
{"text":"So I love the weekend routine of Saturday and/or Sunday brunches, and have been to quite a few places along this Notre Dame strip. All that being said I think this is my new favorite place. So far the best regular coffee I've had with a brunch. The food portions are very generous and quite tasty. In a party of three we couldn't really decide from all of the interesting options available so they conveniently have an \"indecisive\" option which allows you to mix and match some signature sides. The music was great, the vibe was hip and fun, the service was excellent and even the bathrooms were fun with different colour coded themes! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The service was so great!  Benoit's smile is like a ray of sunshine. 

I had an eggs Benedict and the creamy sauce was ample delicious and just a bit salty.  So good.  And that pork?!?  OMG.  Check this bi*ch out."}
{"text":"Unbelievable atmosphere. The restaurant decor is like a modern art exhibit. The bathroom is downright scary...it's like a kill-room from a horror film...and this is supposed to be complimentary. 

As for the food...I got the classic Eggs Benedict and it was amazing. Great portion. The garlic potatoes are the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. 

If you find yourself in Montreal you have to get over here."}
{"text":"My two friends and I came in today for Sunday brunch. We got in line around 11am and waited for about an hour and a half. We considered leaving the line many times but we're very glad we waited it out...

I had the Smoked Meat Eggs Benedict. It was so good! The meat was flavorful and juicy and the Swiss cheese added an interesting kick. It was one of the best Benedicts I've ever had. My friends enjoyed their meals too. I tasted some of their food (The Strawberry Nutella French Toast and the Salted Pretzel Pancake) and it was all so moist and delicious. We also shared a stack of carrot cake pancakes. We loved them, especially the icing on top. I also ordered a hot chocolate, which I quite enjoyed. It was not very sweet, which is great because it did not overwhelm me, considering all the other sweet food that was already on my plate. 

The staff were so helpful and friendly and once we were seated the service was reasonably quick. The decor was also very interesting. Especially the bathroom. It was my first time in Montreal and if I ever come back, I'd love to eat here again."}
{"text":"We took the advice of other Yelp reviewers and were not disappointed!!

Restaurant was full, service was friendly and the food was DELICIOUS! The pure maple service served in the can was a serendipity. Great cappuccino and perfectly crisp bacon complimented light pancakes toped with generous helping of fresh fruit.  

Definitely recommend this place. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Alors là attention j'ai fait beaucoup de brunch à Montreal, beaucoup de breakfast ou de crêpe au nutella ou nutella-banane pour le petit creux de l'après-midi mais de tout ce que j'ai pu manger niveau brunch et breakfast dans ma vie toutes villes confondues je suis réellement tombée amoureuse de cet endroit, une nouvelle fois conseillé par Anne-Laure (donc j'étais pratiquement certaines de ressortir satisfaite). 

Point négatif qui ne m'empêche absolument pas de mettre 5 étoiles: le temps d'attente. Endroit exceptionnel rime souvent avec longue queue pour venir goûter et donc grosse attente. 1h la première fois (mais c'était en week-end) et à peine 20 minutes la deuxième fois (en semaine cette fois). 

Un super petit déjeuner, et pourtant ça restait très simple j'ai pris un frappé choco-banane avec une assiette de pancakes remplie de fraises, myrtilles, fruits des bois, groseilles et framboises. Que du rouge de partout, on ne voyait même plus les pancakes tellement il y avait des fruits et des fruits frais s'il-vous-plaît!! Pour la quantité énormissime présente dans l'assiette le prix était vraiment dérisoire.

Je conseille a chaque personne venant à Montreal de venir manger dans cet endroit. Non seulement le personnel est génial mais la bouf l'est aussi ainsi que les prix payés à la fin. J'étais tellement satisfaite que j'étais vraiment généreuse en pourboire... mais c'était mérité!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! The place is worth trying, worth going back to and worth waiting in line (even if it's cold outside) 
I haven't tried all the menu, but I'm hoping to do so... so far I haven't been disappointed!!! 
If you haven't been there then what are you waiting for! 
My favourite dish is the steak & eggs Benedict!!!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from locals and it was the best recommendation of our lives. I was a little concerned about not having \"English menus\" but the waiter ( who spoke perfect English) recommended the eggs Benny and French toast. I can honestly say...I have never had a better breakfast in my life!!"}
{"text":"We needed a breakfast that could stand up to our dinner the night before at Au Pied de Cochon, so we headed to Restaurant L'Avenue and weren't disappointed. 

Like Schwartz's, L'Avenue opening for business attracts a lineup of people waiting to get into the restaurant, so be sure to dress for whatever weather Montreal is experiencing - and be prepared for the possibility of sitting next to a door that's opening and closing constantly as the hostess checks on the line and finds seats. (If it's cool out, wear a sweater.)

We were greeted in French but every server spoke English (we're learning, but we're not there yet). As we'd seen recommendations online for the eggs benedict that's what we went with, but all of the breakfasts that came out looked great - huge portions, though! Don't treat yourself to a pastry before you go for brunch (and perhaps going after stuffing yourself at PDC the night before isn't the BEST idea...)

We started off with two excellent lattes (in glasses, not bowls, which I sort of regretted... I could definitely have finished a bigger one on that chilly morning). After watching a few people receive gigantic, elaborately garnished smoothies I have to say it would be hard to turn that down on a hot summer day.

Next, our fruit skewers, which seem to come with every breakfast, arrived. And they weren't your typical boring breakfast fruits - sure, there was honeydew, but also pineapple, papaya, grapefruit, strawberry and an exceptionally delicious date. Be aware that the fruit is cleaned minimally - peels and pits were on everything, so don't chomp down with reckless abandon.

I had the chorizo eggs benny, and wow, was it ever good. He had the smoked salmon and it was also delightful (and much lighter), but the combination of chorizo, peppers, spicy potatoes, creamy egg yolks and Hollandaise was really something. (In other words, I wouldn't have switched. Ha!) The potatoes were great, which is a litmus test for me at brunch - there's no excuse for boring potatoes - and although I'm typically disappointed with Hollandaise sauce that isn't home made (it's never lemonny enough or they underseason it) this was pretty good.

Also, I don't care if you have to go or not: be sure to visit the toilettes. 

If we're looking for breakfast in Montreal again we'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Visited this place twice over a span of 3 days in late August where I ordered three different egg benedict dishes (which inconveniently escapes my memory right now) just to feel a range of emotions from elation, awe, guilt, gluttonous intent & action, envy and some wrath for having left. I'm sure there were other deadly sins in the mix too.

IT'S ALL GOOD! My glowing review is a drop in the proverbial ocean of great reviews L'Avenue du Plateau deserves. The line that forms is worth the wait but the staff does well in ensuring that people get their seating in a reasonable amount of time. Want a shot of whiskey while you await your order? Consider it done. Our waiter offered us shots which completely caught me off-guard but were gladly downed upon delivery.

I was fortunate to try L'Avenue when a street fair took place before school started. So it added even more fond memories to our visit.

I plan to drive from NJ back to Montreal so that my wife & kids could witness for themselves the wonder that goes by the name of L'Avenue du Plateau."}
{"text":"I Was super curious of visiting the new location and i believe  is definitely one of my favs spots in town right now! 

The ambiance is pretty uplifting with great tunes and nice staff along with the exquisite menu they offer. I went on a Sunday morning around 11 am and the line wasn't so long, probably like 15-20 mins.  We ordered the Bobby visite L'Espagne and the Chorizo II egg Benedict. They were both delicious with perfectly cooked chorizo and fresh ingredients.

This place is a must for brunch!"}
{"text":"Quelle expérience! L'Avenue Notre Dame vs le plateau rien à voir. J'ai adoré les oeufs benedictines au canard. La déco est super urbaine, avec des tags. J'avoue l'expérience va même jusque dans les toilettes...mais je ne dirai rien, allez-y et vous verrez."}
{"text":"This restaurant is DIVINE!  I was visiting Montreal and needed a proper breakfast place and this one came up as one of the highest rated - now I know why!  I can't tell you how important this place was for me. I follow a strict diet (keto) and need to eat clean when I travel so that I'm not off the rails when returning home and getting back into my normal workout routine.   I compensate that by eating clean while on the road and walking as much as possible instead of taking taxis or subway.  

As for this restaurant, there is a generous breakfast menu and that's what this place specializes in as their hours of operation are 8am - 4pm.  I ordered a Gym Dude omelette which included cheese, grass fed chicken, mushrooms, etc and a heaping serving of mixed salad in place of breakfast potatoes. Wow!!!  A fruit skewer came along with this meal as well, before the omelette was served.

The serving size was generous and the meal was absolutely delicious.  This is a place to come with someone instead of alone, There are only tables and booths, no bar stools at the kitchen or anything.

But make no mistake about it, if you're looking to have an excellent and high-quality breakfast meal in Montreal, this place should be at the top of your list. 

P.S. the line is totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a friend.. and just about everyone who's been to Montreal. This place was so good we ended up coming here twice. GET THE DUCK CONFIT EGGS BENEDICT. Or anything eggs benedict. 

The first morning we ate here we got to the restaurant at around 10(?) and there was already a long line. The wait can get very long too as people like to sit around and chit chat and take their time here. When we finally got in, we already knew what we wanted and ordered the duck confit eggs benedict and steak and eggs benedict. We were actually looking for the crab cake eggs benny but the server said they didn't serve that anymore. Me and my bf both agreed the duck benny was the best. The slightly salty duck paired with caramelized onions and a gram-worthy poached egg was perfect. His steak and eggs were a bit runny and by the end of the meal, looked like soup. Still tasted ok though.

The next morning we got here 5 minutes before it opened. No line yet but we could see people hanging around the shop slowly shifting towards the entrance. 8am we walked right up to the door with probably another 3 couples/families and got seated right away. By the time we left at 9:30 the line had formed. This time we ordered the Indecisive for me - 2 savory items (bacon and ham) and 1 sweet (nutella french toast) . French toast was so fluffy - pair that nutella with the salty bacon or ham and heaven. My bf got the I'll Have It All which is like sampler, a little bit of everything. Today's breakfast wasn't as amazing as yesterdays but still very delicious. Btw, portions are HUGE. We definitely should have split the I'll Have It All. Also, their potatoes are so well seasoned I didn't care if that whole cup of starch was what probably filled me up but I finished it all. 

Service is a little on the slow side. A little hard to flag someone down for whatever it was we needed. Before you leave, don't forget to check out the trippy (and kind of intimidating to pee in) bathroom!"}
{"text":"Now then onto one of the biggest treason I've ever felt. I love l'Avenue, the food is really good and the portions are more than decent. But why oh god why do you put watermelon in the water! I know it's supposed to be better but I'm one of those people who simply can't bear watermelon, the smell and more importantly, the taste. When I went last time, it was hot and I was thirsty and yet I couldn't drink the water I was served. Please keep in mind that not everybody likes watermelon and I sure don't like people assuming my tastes. I know it's not that big a deal but afterwards I had to justify why I wanted tap water when I should be served that in the first place. Anyway food is awesome but beware of the watermelon water!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Had the mushroom and Lardon eggs Benedict. Flavour bursted in my mouth. Coffee tasted different... in a good way. My partner tried the Nutella coffee, very sweet. Came early morning, line up was 45 min."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and worth the wait! Got eggs Benedict, the original, and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"A really commercial brunch place with overrated food and overrated ambience. This place is too touristy and really does not reflect Montréal's great brunch offerings. It's a diner style but made to look fancy, it's just really confusing. The portions are huge especially for its price even though the price ranges from $15 and up. It's hard to finish your  food. The food quality is all right not too bad but I've had so much better in Montreal. I really like their fruit skewers though. there's a very spooky bathroom"}
{"text":"Ordered the eggs benedict which comes with a side of breakfast potatoes and it tasted absolutely delicious but it was the Nutella pancakes that stole the show. The portions are very large and hard to finish. 

Pro tip:Don't forget to check out the bathroom, try to arrive around 8-9am to avoid the long line going around the block."}
{"text":"Le meilleur restaurant pour bruncher à Montreal ! Super super bon, rien à dire. J'ai beaucoup aimé le service et la déco. Par contre, il y a une file d'attente de 15-30 minutes avant d'entrer dans le resto."}
{"text":"Ok, This place is just incredible in every way possible!!! The staff are super friendly and on top of everything. I don't know how they do it to be honest. The watermelon infused water is and awesome touch and extremely refreshing!! The food is exquisite as well!!!

I had the everything breakfast that literally came with everything, French toast pancake Oeuf (eggs) homemade sausage bacon backed beans and a pork mousse which was incredible. 

We also had the banana Nutella French toast which was insane!!!!! The rum syrup that comes with it is insane!!!! 

Do yourself a favor and get here early as in 8 to 9 AM anytime thereafter be prepared to wait. and I mean wait as in a line of 20 people or more."}
{"text":"This is the BEST eggs benedict I've ever had. Tried the Salmon, Ham, Bacon, and Steak & Eggs, and HANDS DOWN, the HAM is the BEST. It's cooked in beer and maple. Doesn't get any better than that. Has a slight kick to it, but nothing over powering. Perfectly cooked eggs, delicious potatoes, and a nice skewer of fruit to go with it. And for a VERY reasonable price.

Love this place! The only thing I wasn't a fan of was how close all the tables were together, and the music was very 'club-like' which didn't really add to the atmosphere. Still fun tho :)"}
{"text":"It was very crowded, and we stood in line for over an hour an da half. The seating arrangement was quite uncomfortable, and the service was quite slow.

The food was good, but not spectacular to justify the 1+ hour wait, or going out of our way just to eat at this place. Overrated and overpriced."}
{"text":"Waited over half an hour to be seated but the atmosphere was worth it. However, at one point during our wait the hostess pulled a group of two (I'm assuming her close friends by the way they greeted each other) from the back of the line and seated them first; I was quite disgruntled considering there were over ten people (and multiple groups of two) in front of them in line.
I loved the music they were playing - songs from the late 90s and early 00s. The wall decorations and the menu spoke to the overall charm of the place. The servers were friendly, upbeat, and contributed to a very welcoming atmosphere. Each patron gets a fruit skewer to munch on while they're waiting for their order to arrive which was very nice. 
I ordered the breakfast poutine: potatoes, sausages, veggies, and cheese curds covered with spicy hollandaise sauce and a poached egg. It was delicious - the first few bites at least. There was a layer of oil that had pooled at the bottom of the dish where the potatoes were: it diluted the sauce and made the dish rather unappetizing after a bit. 
The large portion of food meant I packed my leftovers in a doggie bag while taking care to leave the oil behind - food was still yummy after being in the fridge for a bit. 
Overall I enjoyed my experience because of the ambience of the place. Not sure if I'd be back for the yummy albeit oily food."}
{"text":"I tend to resist waiting in line at a restaurant in a city like Montreal, where there are so many wonderful places to eat with no line involved. But one Saturday we were in the area rather early and decided to give it a try. God, was it worth it!!! Starting with the coffee. Simply the best coffee of the kind I had in Montreal so far. Real coffee. Everything was delicious, inventive, in generous portions. I will definitely go back, even though I got the impression the line outside is more due to the time it takes them to clean a table than to the amount of people wanting one."}
{"text":"This was the first brunch stop on my culinary tour of Montreal, based on the recommendation from a local contact. Arriving early for brunch on a week day, we didn't have to wait too long for a table. Our server was friendly and assisted with menu selections. The fruit smoothy was perfect for the already hot Montreal summer day, and the classic eggs Benedict was perfectly prepared and tasted great. The restaurant was full and the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Oh good gracious THIS is the breakfast emporium! The breakfast menu is simply dizzying. There are so many variations of egg based dishes (regular or Omega 3 ), Eggs Benedict, Omelettes, Montreal Bagels, American Style Fluffy Pancakes, and Exotic Juices to choose from that my eyes were bulging out while attempting to make my mind on what to order. Thank goodness, on Saturdays, breakfast is served from 8am till 4pm.

If you come during the week, you can also enjoy salads, sandwiches, poutines, hamburgers, milkshakes, martinis, steak, stews, curry, other pub fare!

For over 20 years, l'Avenue is best known for their Eggs Benedict of which favorites are the Chorizo, Steak and Eggs or the 'Tout l'Monde à Poële' variations. I went for the third option. Wow, the two gigantic portions were just sitting in front of me waiting to be devoured. The eggs were perfectly poached, oozing with golden yolk as you dug your way in, beautifully dressed with sautéed Champignons de Paris, Pleurotes, Portobello mushrooms and lusciously coated with creamy hollandaise sauce. 

The eclectic atmosphere and excellent service from a dynamic team of smiling waiters, especially Jezabel, who was so patient with me most definitely adds stars to the experience. Kudos to owner Johnny Di Tomasso, a meticulous planner and team builder! 

Will I return to try the Chorizo at L'Avenue? I sure will and so should you. Just one note... this is not a 'cheapy eats' destination so it'll be a bit heavy on your wallet but you do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"One of the best places for brunch. The new location has a shorter waiting line for it's faster to be seated. Their benedict eggs come in many varieties and are amazing. The smoothies are also awesome and come in a huge glass to share."}
{"text":"Location/Service
One of a recommended restaurant to visit in Montreal. It looks a bit small on the outside, but inside has sufficient tables to serve at least 50-60 people. Street parking is available around the lot. It is a very busy restaurant - so make sure you either come early or make a reservation ahead of time if possible!

Inside decor was very homey. There a lot of different colours that brings out a nice vibe. The main attraction would definitely be the washroom. It's glow in the dark, with a lot of graffiti and interesting drawings. Be sure to check it out while you're there!

Service - really loved our waitress. She was so nice, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu items. I asked a lot of questions and she was able to answer them all, gave recommendations and often check on us to make sure we're okay.


Food
Drink - I ordered the Nutella Coffee, which by its name it's literally coffee with Nutella. You have to stir the cup often cause the Nutella tends to stick to the bottom. But it's like a regular chocolate mocha to me, but the hazelnut brings a different taste to it.

Food - ordered the Bobby Does Dallas. It's 3 scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese, topped with black angus steak, mushrooms, sauteed onions and BBQ sauce. Did I say it also came with a side of potatoes? Just listing out the items was a mouthful. The portion were huge - definitely able to be shared. I really liked the scrambled eggs, very fluffy. The steak was cooked to the right level, complimenting well with the BBQ sauce. BBQ sauce is a no fail - it may be a little bit on the sweeter side, that's why I thought having the potatoes there helped balanced it out.

Tip - the order comes with a complimentary stick of fruit (the healthier stuff) and a choice of bread, which I choose baguette.


Overall, very nice experience here at L'Avenue. Everything was nicely done, staff were great and a vibrant atmosphere. Would definitely come back again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Quirky atmosphere with pleasant servers. They have a wide selection of breakfast options. We went bright and early in the morning on a weekday and found no line up. 

We both got eggs benedict and we both liked the spinach one more. The other was a bit rich. Their hollandaise was very tasty but I found that in combination with everything the flavour became overpowered. The fresh orange juice was great.

Overall a good breakfast place. Will try something else next time.

Food - 4/5
Service - 4/5
Atmosphere - 4/5"}
{"text":"Brunch here was so good!  The service was great, and the food was awesome.  I got the Idaho Omlette, it was delicious.  Everyone loved their food.  The portion sizes here are huge.  Thankfully there wasn't a wait when we came, we arrived on a Friday somewhat early, but when we left there was a line forming outside.  I loved the watermelon water they served with the food.  Looking forward to coming back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Dear tourists/suburbanites: These are the locals' simple rules for L'Avenue:

1. If there IS NO line outside L'Avenue, it MIGHT be worth your time/money (depending on what you order and who your server/cook is that day.)

2. If there IS a line outside L'Avenue, the food will be rushed and the service will be poor, so you're better off trying somewhere else nearby like Le Passe Compose, Faberge, Au Pain Perdu, La Petite March, Bistro Tot ou Tard, The Sparrow, or even \"big\" places like Universel, Chez Cora, Eggspectations, etc,)

3. There IS ALWAYS a line outside L'Avenue."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast joint in town. Great portions, great ambiance. The wait is worth it. Be sure to arrive early, line-up can get quite long."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! Huge portions, fancy brunch beverages, and they start you with fresh fruit. The wait was long, but worth it. The menu is vast, so no one will go hungry."}
{"text":"Oui j'ai été une avenue-sceptique. 
Tout d'abord, faire la file pour aller manger n'est pas très normal pour moi. 
Ensuite, faire la file pour aller manger un samedi à 14h quand il fait -25 degrés est simplement inconcevable. 
Bref, en plus, je suis toujours sceptique concernant les restaurants pour lesquels les gens ont beaucoup trop d'engouement, ce genre de restaurant à la mode sur-évaluée. Du coup, si je pouvais envoyer un message à mon moi d'il y a un an et demi arrivant à Montréal et sans travail donc avec beaucoup de temps à perdre ce serait celui-ci : \"Arrêtes de niaiser fille et vas manger à L'Avenue!\"
Maintenant, je comprend l'engouement et ne suis plus sceptique du tout. Par contre, je vais attendre d'avoir a nouveau du temps pour y aller en semaine car la fin de semaine avec la file de 1 heure d'attente, c'est vraiment impossible. Oui même pour du pain perdu de folie avec une poire caramélisée à la vanille et une sauce au chocolat, j'ai mes limites."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!!!! We were recommended to eat here from a local friend and our food was delicious. There was an appetizer of a fruit skewer, and I had the little bit of everything meal. (I can't seem to remember what it was called) Also, make sure to check out the bathroom before you go!

The reason I give it four stars and not five is because we waited for an hour and a half on line. Granted, we were a group of 7- but no one could give us an accurate wait time. Finally, after an hour and half in we decided it would be smarter to spilt into two groups. Secondly, our waiter was very overwhelmed with the amount of people in the restaurant, so much so that he forget two of our drinks. (We were three people)

However, I would definitely eat here again- just remember they get super crowded super fast."}
{"text":"The duck confit eggs Benedict and mac and cheese pancake is a MUST. Come hungry. Friendly wait staff and comfortable seating."}
{"text":"The line up was a bit long so we waited, but good things happen to those who wait. I got seated directly under a motorcycle. We had the eggs with fruit, potatoes, bacon and toast and they were super attractively plated and nicely priced for the portion, the server was really nice and they took our food allergies seriously letting us substitute for no charge. I will be returning.

However I watched my food wait on the counter for a few minutes under the heat lamp with all those attractive eggs benedicts and it was lukewarm on arrival even though it was steaming when they prepared it as i witnessed."}
{"text":"Loved the decor in this restaurant- it was retro with graffiti/art all over the walls and a motorcycle hanging above our heads. We waited over an hour (as expected) to get a table here. Luckily the weather was beautiful, and they had free fresh lemonade for anyone in line. The space was a little cramped, and once we were seated, we still had to wait for menus since they didn't have enough.

I had very high expectations for the food because everyone raved about it being the best brunch spot in Montreal. My bf and I shared a smoothie, which was okay, but it had too much raspberry flavor, and I didn't taste whatever else the waitress described it having (supposedly strawberry, basil, etc). What was nice though is that they give you a free plate of fruit on a skewer. I got the steak and eggs benedict with potatoes. The potatoes were probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had- they were cooked perfectly and had a hint of salty and sweet flavor to them. For my steak and eggs (and mushrooms) benedict, it was delicious. However, my poached eggs were overcooked and they didn't ooze out like they were supposed to. This was a little disappointing, but overall I still enjoyed my meal here."}
{"text":"This is the first time I had brunch in MTL, so I cannot compare with other restaurants, however, it was a really good experience in L' , foods have nothing to say, there are very good! All you need attention is the dishes are big potion! Grils should notice that, by the way, my male friend and I both couldn't finish them."}
{"text":"I have been here and I had the French toast. It was delicious but too sweet for me. This time I ordered egg Benedict and omg it was delicious. I also had a large latte it was giant haha. L'avenue has been my favorite place for brunch. I would suggest to go before 11am on weekdays and before 10am on weekends to avoid the line."}
{"text":"Up until February 2010 I loved this place. It was one of my favourite places to eat brunch or lunch.

The only reason I'm posting this is so my friends know I have officially removed it from my Montreal Places to Eat. I had lunch with my sister and some friends and it failed for the following reasons:
 Horrible service: More than one hour passed between ordering and food arriving 

The clubhouse sandwich I ordered was on soggy bread 
Our fries were swimming in grease 
The salad was drowning in dressing - I'm not even sure what the dressing was but it tasted like oil 

I'm so disappointed - but I guess I'm the only one...because every time I walk by it (which is a lot) it's always busy...everyone is different :)"}
{"text":"We came here by suggestion of an owner at another restaurant and I am sure glad we did!! The brunch was delicious. Different than your usual (being from the US) - we really enjoyed every bite. You also get big portions and variety for your buck - we opted for the indecisive list, definitely worth it. We will be sure to come back on our next visit to Montreal! Definitely try this spot, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Worth the wait.

Just like everyone else, I think this place is fantastic.  I had the ...  well I don't remember the French name for it, it was the \"I want to eat everything because it looks so good so bring me all of the things\" breakfast.  Great stuff!

The lady says that hers was \"out of control good\". 

They'll also bring you both coffee AND beer, which is pretty ideal at noon."}
{"text":"Es de esos lugares que tienen desayuno todo el día. Nosotros pedimos un especial de huevos benedictinos y un burrito vegetariano con papas fritas. Todo muy rico. Antes del plato traen una brochette de frutas.
El precio es un poco caro porque en eso gastamos unos 44 CAD pero la atención de la camarera fue muy buena."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite breakfast place in MTL. Everything was perfect. The staff was really nice and the food came out fairly quickly. The portions are a great size and everything on the menu is awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone no matter the occasion!"}
{"text":"I took milky french toast with poached pear, walnuts, chocolate and whipped cream. I couldn't finish it because of the large serving and also the poached pear wasn't something i liked. My sister took their crab cake eggs Benedict, it tasted like a sushi. Maybe we ordered the wrong things from the menu so we didn't have the best breakfast experience. The bathroom was weird. It had glow in the dark graffiti everywhere which made it poorly lit and not at all good for fixing your lipstick."}
{"text":"est victime de sa réputation. Décor atypique et fun. Mais beaucoup trop d'attente pour la qualité des plats. Plats trop gras. Espace trop bruyant. Il y a de bien meilleurs adresses encore méconnues pour un brunch à Montreal. Si il y a la queue passez votre chemin."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good! From their creative french toast, pancakes or other menu items, they definitely live up to their reputation as the top breakfast spot in Montreal. Just plan to arrive early to avoid the line that starts to forms shortly after opening."}
{"text":"Best steak eggs Benedict ! Also came with fruit to start which was very refreshing. Two choices of beer, Laurentide is a local beer 710ml for 6 dollars not bad at all."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast. The place, service, and food was excellent and hip. The bathroom was also quite interesting, with neon lights and intricate graffiti on the walls. Make sure you visit the bathroom here!"}
{"text":"4.5/5
My boyfriend & I drove to Montreal to celebrate our anniversary for the weekend . We are from Michigan. BEST decision ever. This breakfast spot is absolutely amazing , after we ate here the first morning we went every morning for breakfast, there is a line outside the door it's that good! Get there early if you don't want to stand but it's worth it!

*reasonably priced!

The portions are shareable ! Especially the French toast

Must orders- the French toast with toasted coconut, caramelized bananas, Nutella, run sugared sauce , words cannot do this justice it's a life changer ! It's also huge!
-I love fresh squeezed juices ! I had the grapefruit and another day  the mimosa it was delicious! 

The latte was yummy and the service was so nice I loved the environment

The bathroom is so cool it's UV everything about this place is great. This gets my vote for breakfast award :)

I included a picture of myself so you could see the wall art so awesome and colorful"}
{"text":"There is always a wait here, and sometimes the line extends around the block! But its all for good reason. The breakfasts at L'Avenue are FANTASTIC.

I have literally loved everything I've had here. Their smoothies, their french toasts, their potatoes, their eggs benedict... Speaking of eggs benedict, this restaurant makes the most delicious eggs benedict in Montreal. I have eaten at many brunch places, and seriously, after I tried L'Avenue, I was a convert. I never went anywhere else again. 

Show up before 10am when the lineup isnt that intense, and you won't have to wait for ages to get in. But why in the world would you wake up that early on a weekend, you ask? Well.. because L'Avenue is worth it."}
{"text":"If you love eating hearty meals this is definitely the place to go. Great portion sizes, many options to choose from. Pleasant wait staff and great drinks!"}
{"text":"La Avenue was one of the best food experiences I had in Montréal. I had the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict , and my friends ordered Nutella and Strawberry French Toast and an Omelette. Everything tasted amazing, the Eggs Benedict was probably the best I've ever had. The French Toast was also extremely flavourful. All the portions were also massive.

The ambience of the place was great too, very upbeat. The staff were kind and the service was quick. If I lived in Montréal, I would be a regular here."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best places to get a breakfast or brunch in Montreal. The line up wait time outside is around 20-30 minutes but it is so worth it. Everything is cooked to perfection and you get a complementary assortment of fruits to start off. The water is infused with watermelon, which gives a very unique taste. The decor is very hipster and unique. (make sure to check out the washrooms) Every table has a huge can of maple syrup and the service is incredible, the waiters are willing to wait on you with a smile regardless of your needs. 

My only complaint is the menus are only in french and they do not offer a english alternative. 

This is a Montreal MUST for any food lovers."}
{"text":"I can imagine the chaos this eatery melts into for weekend brunch so I opted to visit at a quieter time during the week.
Damn fine burger.  
Clean, eerily cool restrooms.
Good service, reasonable prices for high quality of food. 
Good neighborhood spot and a nice use of the space."}
{"text":"Overrated! Il y a une tonne de bons restaurants pour les brunchs à Montréal. Ne perdez pas votre temps à faire la queue dans cet attrape-touriste."}
{"text":"Loved it. Waited outside in the cold for a good 30-45 minutes, but it was worth it. Got the eggs bene with steak (they call it Steak & Eggs). Hubby got the bene with chorizo- both were awesome and portioned large. Potatoes were amazing (tried to get the recipe, but even the waiter couldn't get it out of the chef!).  Music's jumping, so if you do go early, be prepared for a club-like setting. Sangria- great! Service- great (our waiter was wearing a kilt- punk rock style!). 

Worth it, worth it, worth it."}
{"text":"Maybe I should have stuck to the eggs Benedict as the burger underwhelmed. After striking out at the must try to get in spot close by I checked the places I had bookmarked and this place was the closest and had no wait on a Friday night.
The interior is striking to stay the least. I was dinning alone so didn't care and just wanted something to fuel up. The burger seemed like a decent option so I decided to go with the Kobe style beef version. I was asked how I would like it cooked and I asked for chef's choice (medium rare)
The service was poor actually as the server had to be flagged to get things going. On to the burger looked hefty so will get you going I guess. Devoid of taste and barely spiced I would say one can do a lot better. Fries were nothing special either."}
{"text":"Two hours before hubby's business meeting, i dragged him to this restaurant.  He didn't' look very happy when he saw the long line outside of the restaurant, but i insisted that either this or no brunch.  Thirty minutes later, we were finally seated, ten minutes later, our nice waiter took our order, 20 minutes later, our food came, 5 minutes later, husband said very good food and ran out of the door to his meeting.

On the other hand, my brunch was quite a pleasant experience.  The menu is quite extensive.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.  He recommended steak and eggs Benedict, and that was very delicious.  I had chorizo omelet and that was just a-ok.  each meal comes with grilled potatoes and some fresh fruits.  I'd say the meal worth the wait."}
{"text":"Expensive high-end breakfast a little drive away from downtown. Ordered Nutella coffee and strawberry Nutella pancakes. The coffee was yum! The pancakes were huge and three in number. Very large portion for breakfast. They were soft and fluffy and neutrally sweet by themselves. Service was great and they serve fruit infused water and fruit skewers while you wait for food"}
{"text":"Best Eggs Benedict I have ever had. Smoothies are a bit pricey, but worth it for the huge size and taste. Even having to wait in line to get in, it's now my favourite breakfast place in town!

If you get the chance, you must go!"}
{"text":"Such a great little place to have breakfast. We had the classic and chorizo eggs Benedict and it was absolutely amazing! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time to try Eggs benedict. 

Me an my husband looked up on yelp and found this place. We went there on Friday around 3:30-4:00ish, so we didn't need to wait so long. Only 2girls were before us.(few days later we've seen ppl are waiting on a very long line)

So, the eggs benedict was really good. We ordered two kinds and shered. We really enjoyed, but afterwards, we both had a minor stomach upset all day long....mmm."}
{"text":"This is hands down the greatest breakfast/brunch place in Montreal!! When we got to the restaurant there was a line out the door in winter!! The wait wasn't that bad and we got seated about 10 minutes later. When we got the menu my partner and I where amazed with how many items there where on the menu. I already had my eye on the French toast with strawberries, blueberries and bananas with a dulce de leche whipped cream so I ordered that. 

The first thing that came was two at fruit skewers that were a good start to the meal. When the main course came and I took my first bite of the French toast it was unbelievable. All I have to say is this place is a must go if you are in Montréal."}
{"text":"Came here because of all the reviews but the food was pretty mediocre. I enjoyed their oversized fruit smoothies burnt wasn't out of this world you gotta eat the food. I also didn't have to wait long, when we left there was along line, I don't think I this is a spot that is worth a long wait"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with amazing menu of well made delicious large portion breakfast and lunch grub. Portions were too large for us but the taste more than made up for it. 

Well worth it. 

Also must check out the loo. The decorations in there will surely extend your visit as you will surly be video taping the clock and taking pics of the graffiti interior. :)"}
{"text":"I had the chicken eggs Benedict at L'Avenue. I know, who gets chicken eggs benny, but it was good and the chorizo one was better. The hype behind this place is a bit much imo, or maybe I didn't try the correct thing. It would've been a solid 3.5-4 stars, if this place wasn't as hyped up with all the line ups!!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch, définitivement à essayer si vous visitez Montréal. Par contre je ne mettrais pas 4 étoiles car son gros défaut est d'être bruyant et toujours bondé"}
{"text":"Be prepared for a long wait and hope it's not raining!

This spot was recommended by some friends for breakfast/brunch. I would say the wait is a good 45min-1hr. 

Once you get through that painful experience, the real good stuff begins.  The service is pretty quick and friendly.

The food portions are insane. Let me say this once, I highly recommend you share dishes, do NOT order more than one dish per person, you will go into a coma.

You can get a bunch of different pancake and egg dishes. The pancakes with bananas and dulce de leche are amazing! They have a bunch of variations, but be prepared to take a nap after all that food.

If you get a chance, check out the bathrooms. they have a funky decor, won't say more  as it would spoil it."}
{"text":"Si j'avais pu, j'aurais sans doute donné 3  1/2 étoiles au restaurant l'Avenue. Je vis en quelque sorte une relation amour-haine avec cet endroit. Leurs plats, surtout leurs déjeuners, sont si délicieux et le service est toujours très courtois, mais...Il y a également beaucoup de \" mais \" (sans faire de jeu de mot par rapport au menu très fourni de la place). 
Tout d'abord, le décor est assez amusant! Je me suis toujours fait accueillir à l'Avenue avec de grands sourires sympathiques. Le restaurant n'est ni petit ni très grand, mais préparez-vous à faire la file dehors si vous arrivez aux heures de pointe! 
Je suis allée bruncher et souper à quelques reprises à ce resto. Chaque fois, j'ai adoré la nourriture, mais un peu moins l'ambiance, surtout à l'heure du brunch. De la musique électronique qui joue à tue-tête un dimanche matin, boff. Pas l'idéal pour démarrer la journée! Par contre, à l'heure du souper cela peut être bien, surtout lorsque l'on est entre ami(e )s! Leur sangria est délicieuse et rafraîchissante, quoi qu'un peut chère il me semble...
La partie \" haine \" de mon aventure avec l'Avenue vient de ma dernière visite... J'avais l'habitude de commander la petite salade césar avec poulet grillé lorsque je n'avais pas trop faim et que je ne savais pas trop quoi prendre. Je savais que le poulet était délicieux et que la portion n'était pas trop grosse, contrairement à tous leurs autres plats. C'est ce que j'ai commandé la dernière fois que j'y suis allée. Plutôt que de me dire que la petite salade césar n'était plus au menu, la serveuse m'a apporté une  de grand format. Après lui avoir fait remarquer, elle me dit qu'il n'y a jamais eu de salade de petit format et que c'était ainsi, point barre. Pourtant, j'avais pris ce plat à plusieurs reprises par le passé. En lui disant, elle me regardait comme si j'étais la pire idiote de la planète et m'a dit qu'elle ne pouvait rien faire en repartant avec l'air le plus bête au monde. Vous direz peut-être que ce n'est pas grand chose, mais il fallait y être pour comprendre...."}
{"text":"Incredible service and fantastic food, we lined up for 20 mins and it was still worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch spot ever! This place gets five stars for food, drinks, pricing, and decor! I liked this place so much that I ate there twice when visiting Montreal. The 45 minute wait in line is worth it! Everything about this place is awesome. 

First of all the decor amazing! There's all types of cool art to look at. They also have a really cool concept for the menu. It's a game show menu, very creative! The star of the decor is the glow in the dark bathroom. Talk about DOPENESS at its finest! I would've stayed in the bathroom for hours if it didn't look weird lol. 

Now for the food and drinks. Everyone gets a fruit skewer to start. They have this delicious Nutella coffee, that comes with a piece of dark chocolate. They also have smoothies, exotic juices, and different flavored mimosas. All the drinks tasted super fresh. This place is known for its egg Benedict dishes. I'm not a huge fan of egg Benedict but the steak and mushrooms one was delicious! I was very pleased with it. My friend ordered the \"Mac and cheese\" pancake and it was mouth watering good. It tasted like delicious baked macaroni and cheese in a pancake. I'm very picky about my Mac and cheese, and trust me when I tell you that you must try this if you're a Mac and cheese lover. I'm actually  thinking about it now as I'm writing this review :-). 

The best thing about all of this is the prices were super cheap. This place would be at least $50 if it was in NYC. You get so much bang for your buck here. Do yourself a favor and add this to your to do list if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"How do we get this to NYC?! This was hands down one of the best brunches I have ever had. The truffle breakfast sandwich was out of this world as were the many mimosas. The duck eggs benedict was so well done that we plan on going back again tomorrow and repeating the same brunch. The waitstaff was wonderful and we didn't feel rushed once!"}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for months and decided to start my birthday off here for brunch! I've passed my L'Avenue several times and there's usually a line, but we were lucky to arrive just early enough for there to be some open seating still. 

Walking in, one can't help but be struck by the decor: a motorcycle hanging from the ceiling in front of a graffiti mural, cute asymmetrical lighting above the booths, retro chairs, a huge replica of a can of syrop d'erable, a gigantic mirror in the back. A good selection of music served as a backdrop as we checked out the cleverly-designed game show themed menus. 

Food wise, lots of great choices, but for my birthday, I went for the duck Benedict, and it was definitely what one might expect: rich, fatty, juicy. Not sure if I'd order that on the regular, but it was delectable to say the least. My boo got the \"Indecisive\" with the Creme Brûlée French toast (amazing), the homemade sausage and cretons. All the food was on point. 

Their coffee by the way is cheaper than Timmys but a million times better (however I doubt they take to-go orders for it). 

Finally, nature called and I paid a visit to thee infamous restroom. Nothing like taking a tinkle while surrounded wall-to-ceiling by black light-illuminated artwork. I felt like I was peeing in outer space. 

In short, L'Avenue is a one-of-a-kind dining experience that hits on all the essentials: food, service, and ambience. Arrive early or during slow hours to avoid the line, and order the cheap delicious coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Simply the best. Do not be scared of the mac n cheese pancakes. Make sure to stop in the bathroom! Will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Nothing less than 5 stars!, Absolutely amazing food and service!
The eggs-benedict is their signature dish.  Great portions are given too!
Wonderful atmosphere!
Please open up one in downtown Toronto!!! :)"}
{"text":"We waited an actual hour to get into this place and it was worth it! I am not a patient man but this I believe was worth  the wait!

I got the Eggs Benny with the crab cakes and Caviar and man oh man was it worth it! The crab cakes were fresh and the eggs and the sauce was on point. The staff was really good and just an overall great place to be. 

The place has a lot of funki-ness and its nice! The washrooms are something, that a must check out! LOL! Gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Monday afternoon for an extended weekend brunch and were not disappointed. I've never seen so many benedict's! It also seemed to not be the busiest, which probably made our experience so-much-better. There's not a lot of waiting area that wouldn't put you hovering over another table.

I got the duck confit (coin coin benedict). The presentation was all you could ever want from your brunch. There were potatoes and a fruit skewer. My only complaint is that it was all a little under seasoned. Salting duck confit at the table might be viewed at as a cry for help.

The bathrooms are one of a kind for sure. Black lights, wall mirror, graffiti, wild life nature programs playing on a flatscreen tv in the bathroom make for a memorable experience for sure. Though you may want to consider who you bring here for this reason. It's also a bit loud for 11am. Grandma might not appreciate. 

The menu is French only, but most items are so simple and universal that if you're foodie enough to be eating in this place, it should be fine.

It does seem that it might be better to be a regular here... or if you're in a hurry, to get a cold sandwich. One or the other. The couple next to us got some sandwiches (equally as beautiful as our bennies) about 10 minutes before our order came.

All things considered, I'd definitely put this on my breakfast list for the next time I return to Montreal."}
{"text":"The line is long. But I'm not even upset because the service was great, food was amazing!!!! The whole decor, ambiance... Great. The waiters are polite, happy, and know what they are talking about.... I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I recently went back and had a breakfast BLT ($8.95) that was made with thick toast, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, mayo and two runny eggs and it was delicious! It was also served with a crock of breakfast potatoes and a large skewer of fresh fruit. The balance of flavors was spot on. While it was messy to eat, it was so good!

I could only finish half of it and was still super stuffed.

The waitress was lovely too. 

Another delicious brunch at L'avenue!"}
{"text":"Waited outside in the negative degree weather for about 20 minutes...frozen fingertips and all. So happy when we were seated, and the staff was very welcoming. I ordered the salmon eggs benedict - I usually like ordering this dish at other places, but the sauce and cream cheese here were too much for me. Potatoes with mayo and ketchup, though...very good! I also really enjoyed the Nutella coffee - I really wanted to order another cup. I'd go back to try something else on the menu...but probably in the Summer time."}
{"text":"Une super place pour les accrocs du brunch....certes la line up peut être rébarbative mais ça vaut le coup de patienter un peu! 
La salle est décorée de graffitis et leurs alcôves avec mégas banquettes sont super confortables!
Le choix de brunch est impressionnant et j'avoue même avoir eu de grandes difficultés à choisir! 
Aux estomacs sur pattes et autres gastronomes...je recommande le \"bon ben moi je prends toute!\" Pour lequel vous en aurez vraiment pour votre argent! Mais attention....pour profiter pleinement de ce copieux repas...il vous faudra jeûner quelque peu avant de déguster! 
Petit coup de cur pour l'eau qui a un petit goût de pastèque.....et pour les toilettes....je sais ça peu paraître un peu étrange...mais leur côté palais des glaces psychédélique m'a conquise!"}
{"text":"If you go to Montreal you must go here for brunch! The line was long but well worth the wait. We got the Nutella crepes, French toast and classic eggs benedict. Also hot chocolate and a smoothie to share! So delicious and the waitress was so lovely. Couldn't believe how good this place was!!! OH and go to the bathroom before you leave ;)"}
{"text":"My son was on a sugar high all day long after having the FRENCH toast with caramelized bananas and Nutella in brioche bread. I had a bite and it was heavenly. I had the \"Indecisive\" with eggs, bacon and two of the carrot cake pancakes. They were sinful. 

I highly recommend this place for breakfast/brunch, but either get there early or be prepared to wait. The line was down the block when we left."}
{"text":"I had one of the eggs Benedict dishes. The portions were rather large for me, however the meal, as is expected of eggs benedicts, hearty and sumptuous. The hollandaise sauce was rich and fulfilled my comfort food craving. :) I really liked the servers"}
{"text":"The hype is real. But particularly for the french toast, which is AMAZING. Stood in line BEFORE 11am for about an hour and 15mins on Sunday morning, which is supposedly a good time to go to beat the line. But it was an extra busy weekend in Montreal and even the waitress said she had never seen the line as long as it was pre-11am. Anyway, we stuck it out because L'Avenue comes highly recommended from locals + tourists alike. Kudos to the Second Cup coffee shop on the corner because they fo sho benefit from all those patient enough to wait in that line. 

Anyway, back to the french toast. I ordered eggs benedict with caramelized onions + cheddar for my main, which was delicious no doubt! But my bf and I ordered the plain french toast to share for dessert. We took one bite each (BANGIN') and took the rest home, which I assure you only tasted better later in the day after soaking in all that delicious, Canadian maple syrup. They use the thickest slices of brioche...so soft + fluffy but still crispy on the edges. And no joke, it tasted like a Krispy Kreme pillowy glazed donut. KK obvi is the top of the line when it comes to donuts so basically, that is heaven in french toast. Talk abt setting the bar high.

While I am not one to believe the hype and wait in obscene lines, I would do it again just for that french toast.

P.S. Service is very good!"}
{"text":"This place has become a Montreal attraction site. 
I've been here multiple times and it remains a favorite brunch spot for me.The line is almost always guaranteed to be huge on weekends and stat days. Big groups can wait up to 45 minutes. The menu has changed over the years but the classics remain on there. A collection of morning smoothies to start and the best steak and eggs Benedict! Everyone who works there is very nice and service is great."}
{"text":"The Brunch is insane lots of choices
Fresh juices are also very tasty

Service is a tad snobby for my liking but overall the experience was good as the food makes up for snobbiness.

Expect long waits on the weekends as it is a hot spot but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. I got the steak and eggs:  eggs Benedict atop steak with a delicious sauce. I was also impressed by the available Tabasco choices"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!  Smoothies are incredible,  staff is incredible. Even the lineup is fun,  waited an hour,  played my portable speaker outside,  the whole lineup was dancing. Once we got in the owner comped my breakfast,  he loved the atmosphere we generated out there!"}
{"text":"It was fabulous! We were table of 4 and ordered pretty much everything we were interested. Everything turned to be great, especially my egg bene! And this place is so cool to sit in, even in the bathroom lol lol ! I couldn't help myself but I took photos in the bathroom because it's just too cute to resist!"}
{"text":"Me and girlfriend went to Montreal to see Cirque du Soleil at the Bell Centre and stayed in a hotel for the night. Before leaving, we went here for brunch.

The restaurant's interior is so artsy, graffiti on the wall and a replica of Harley-Davidson motorcycle hanging! It was so cool! Their menu is in French and no English translation, so it might be hard for people who doesn't understand French. But their servers can speak perfect English for sure they can help.

The food was excellent, my girlfriend had an apple pancakes and I had chorizo! It was ONE OF THE BEST BREAKFAST we've ever had! L'Avenue is like heaven! If I live in Montreal, I would go here frequently for brunch! 

When we went here, it was a snowstorm, but there's a huge line outside! We were lucky we went there early like around 10 am didn't have to wait for a table. Imagine that, even on a snowstorm people patiently waited outside for a table at L'Avenue! So come early! Oh, the frontside of the restaurant is kind of tight, so be careful when squeezing in between two tables and taking your coats off, you might accidentally elbow someone or their glass of water. Also, they tend to play their music a bit louder, which I didn't mind, but if your preferred environment for your morning meal is more quiet Downton Abbey-style, then this place is not for you.

I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Specialize in breakfast and brunch, L'Avenue is the only place in Montréal that serves brunch menu EVERYDAY, seven days a week! That's right, you no longer have to wait till weekend to have brunch options or satisfy your craving for Milk French Toast with Caramelized Bananas, Nutella, Rum Sauce and Coconut or Toasted Croissants with Mushrooms and Pulled Duck, top with Truffle. The big red menu has good variety of choices to match any flavor profile... whether it's something healthy or hearty, sweet or savory, vegan or gluten-free.

L'Avenue is not only a hot spot among locals, but it's also high on radar among visitors as well. There's always a wait line on the street and on some days (mostly weekends), the wait can reach one and a half hour long. Hey, early bird gets the worms first, right? But no worries, they have plenty if you're willing to wait."}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch place in Montreal. The line was an hour long when I first went there but it was totally worth the wait. The servers are very nice and friendly. I ordered the duck benedict + steak n eggs benedict ... and let me tell you, their hollandaise sauce was out of this world! You will not be disappointed! But will never eat brunch the same way again. Will definitely miss this restaurant"}
{"text":"Totally worth the one hour wait. The food is great; however, the portion is too big. We ordered a duck Benedict and strawberry, blueberry, banana French toast and couldn't finish it. Everything is just perfect besides the long line."}
{"text":"Amazing food copieux que ce soit pour déjeuner ou bruncher c'est la place  le staff génial aussi"}
{"text":"If you have a big appetite, you should definitely come here for brunch! The restaurant is loud, funky and hip, you'll most likely see a massive line-up outside if you dare go past 11:30. I've been lucky every time and haven't had to wait more than 5-10 minutes because I've gone around 10:30-11, I've seen line ups take up to an hour and go around the block. It is that damn good, so get their before \"brunch rush hour\" and you will be satisfied. They're known best for their amazing eggs-benedict concoctions. My favorite is the Mr. Seguin (goat cheese, spinach and mushrooms). Their potatoes are soft and delicious. 

For the meat lovers, steak-benedict is the way to go. So is their schorizo if you can handle its spicy kick.

Writing this review is making me crave it... I believe a trip to L'Avenue is in order, ASAP."}
{"text":"Always a lineup, so come prepared! That said, portions are huge and will leave you definitely satisfied! 

Had the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. The hollandaise sauce is great - not too creamy, good combination of salty and sweet. 

And their washrooms are an adventure onto themselves, blacklit with amazing wall drawings!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast I had in a long time!! Everything was perfect!! Waiter was very professional, fast and willing to take a tone of pictures.. highly recommended and definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is great. As a tourist from out of town, two locals recommended it. Food was excellent abd the portions were HUGE. the artwork on the walls and the bathroom were worth it unto itself"}
{"text":"Took my Mother here for her Birthday. Was a fantastic way to start our morning. The food was something I will be talking about for months. When anyone asked me about my trip all I could think of was how delicious the food was. Makes me wanna move to Montreal and live a 600 pound life....back to L'Avenue... the interior experience was absolutely amazing from the coffee to the service. Servers were polite, always smiling. Willing to speak English  which I found was quite common. I appreciate this, as I didn't wanna be rude by attempting French very poorly. My mother enjoyed pancakes with Nutella and strawberries..as I sprung for the savory with the egg and fruit breakfast. Beautiful delivery, I don't have a single negative thing to say about this spot. Aside from it being small. Which in my opinion added to the intimate feel of our breakfast."}
{"text":"Never understood the obsession with eggs benedict or french toast (or brunch fare, really), but when the two are together on a plate, magic happens.  The fluffy, slightly crispy bread dabbled in runny egg yolk, hollandaise, and maple syrup is genius. It's the best of both sweet and savory worlds. I don't think I will have another benedict like this one. 

My host recommended that I show up real early to get on the anticipated long line. I arrived 10-15 minutes after opening and there were still plenty of tables available."}
{"text":"Amazing tasting quality food.
From LA.
Heres what i got
Fresh organic green juice
Iced almond latte
And the sweet frenchtoast benedict (got my eggs scrambled)
Super large portions - be warned.
Great service
Menu is in french."}
{"text":"We had seen this place with lines out the door all the time so I dragged the bf out of bed early to get brunch here at 9.

We stumbled thru ordering in French and enjoyed our leisurely meal of spinach/chevre eggs benedict + fruity pain doré. YUMMM. And I love how most of the dishes come with a fresh fruit skewer and the best potatoes you'll ever taste. You know the place is legit when their sides are amazing, so of course the eggs benedict & french toast were off the wall. Flavorful and complex without being overwhelming, and the french toast was basically bread pudding.. which I love. I'll have dessert for breakfast any day (and I had half of it leftover for real dessert that night too).

I don't know if this place caters to American tourists or what, but their portion sizes were GINORMOUS! And the decor was very Plateau/hipster-y, the waitstaff quick and courteous (and very generous with their French). And though there was a huge line by the time we left, we never felt rushed."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday morning around 11:30am -- wait was about 20 minutes but I'm told that's nothing for this spot. Got the dark chocolate French toast with pear and walnuts and it was quite decadent!

Don't forget to use the restroom while here, it's a black light spectacle!"}
{"text":"Attention, ce restaurant est une tuerie ! Une amie de Montréal nous avait prévenu que cet endroit était le meilleur spot de la ville pour bruncher alors nous avons voulu y aller dès le lendemain matin (ou midi plutôt...).

En semaine, à 11h30, il avait déjà la queue, environ 15 personnes attendaient devant nous et ça ne s'est pas arrêté. Je n'ose pas imaginer l'attente en hiver par -20° ! Une fois notre tour arrivé, on entre dans cette très grande salle à la déco super sympa à l'américaine, une moto accrochée au mur, du style partout et de la musique qui réveille un peu. Wahou, j'en oubliais presque ma faim débordante !

Le menu arrive et là ça nous panique plus qu'autre chose.... des tas de propositions toutes tentantes ! Souvent à base d'oeufs, les formules brunch sont accompagnés de fruits frais, de pain, de peanut butter, etc....

J'ai opté pour le croquant sucré salé composé de deux ufs bénédictines montés sur des muffins avec jambon et sirop d'érable.... J'ai eu du mal à finir mais qu'est ce que c'était bon !!

Le service est irréprochable excepté un petit peu d'attente mais vu la qualité des plats préparés, la quantité de monde à servir, c'est négligeable. Je suis bluffé par ce restaurant qui mérite les 5 étoiles haut la main."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a friend. The place gets busy very quickly, so I recommend arriving early, or get reservations. When you are seated you are given a complementary fruit kabob, and the water was fused with watermelon. I had a green tea matcha latte, which was amazing, and for my main dish I had the chicken and waffles. The sauce is a general tao sauce, which gave the dish a different flavor. If your ever in the plateau area, defenatly give L'avenue a try, best to walk up the street and stroll up the mountian."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the long wait outside. We waited for about 20 minutes at noon on a Tuesday and it was worth it. Awesome space, terrific food. The strawberry blueberry French toast was quite a sight. Goat cheese omelet was fantastic. Plus, probably the coolest restaurant bathrooms I've ever seen."}
{"text":"I was confused as to how so many Montreal restaurants get near perfect ratings but I think I understand why. They really do deliver! not just because the people there are so nice!

Although we did wait in the cold on a Saturday morning for around 1.5 hours, I can assure you that the food is worth the wait. The eggs bennies are poaches to perfection and the hollandaise sauce is so smooth and creamy. It's pure heaven on a plate. The potatoes are seasoned nicely and everything just goes together really well. It was the best brunch I have eaten. There are ones in New York that are comparable but I would say that the flavours are not as \"full of life\", if that makes sense. It's fresh but still extremely satisfying. I think I'm going here each time I go to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Some of the best brunch I've had in a long time. Portions are gigantic, and the options are varied. It can be crowded but I really enjoyed this experience. I had a mountain of pancakes with bacon and cheese paired with a really tasty smoothie."}
{"text":"Mon avis est un peu tardif, mais je devais vous faire partager cette expérience, il ne faut pas louper cette adresse. En voyage à Montréal, on nous avait conseillé cet endroit pour un brunch, alors ... Allons-y !

On était prévenus, mais notre visite à L'Avenue a commencé par ... plus de 30 minutes d'attente (sous la pluie) ... Il y a du monde ! Mais ça se mérite. Lorsqu'une table se libère et que vient enfin notre tour, en entrant, première bonne impression : la déco est absolument GENIALE ! Moto au plafond, graphs sur les murs, ambiance décontractée ... J'adhère direct ! 

Vient ensuite le moment de commander, et là ... Pouah trop de choix, que vais-je bien pouvoir prendre ? Un bon gros smoothie au fruit à boire, et puis allez, des ufs brouillés au bacon, un peu de pomme de terre ? Oh et puis les pancakes fraise/Nutella ont l'air énorme et super bon ... Oui ... tout ça. C'était certes beaucoup trop, mais tout avait l'air tellement bon ! 

Et n'avait pas que l'air d'ailleurs ! Ce brunch promet d'être pour longtemps le meilleur que j'ai fait EVER. Le service était très sympa et on s'est sacrément régalés. Il y a largement le choix pour satisfaire tout le monde pour un prix plus que raisonnable. Si je repasse par Montréal, je repasserais forcément par L'Avenue !"}
{"text":"Had a smoke meat benedict for brunch. Came with a skewer of fruits. It was great and filling. The smoke meat was delicious. The hang indoor motorbike makes for good photos"}
{"text":"I've had countless eggs benedict's in my life. This is my go to item and at any brunch place. The eggs benedict I had at L'Avenue were the best i've ever had in my entire life. I'm not even gassin the spot they were unbelievable. Highly recommended it's worth the wait. cool bathrooms too"}
{"text":"Brunch was absolutely delicious, the menu contains very creative brunch preparations. I will point out that the service was a tad slow for my taste. They brought us our fruit 'brochettes' 5-10 minutes after our order, but the meals came about 30 minutes after the original order was placed."}
{"text":"I went here last time, I visited Montreal and I wanted to check it out again.

Food: 3.5/5
We were here for the lunch rush. The line up outside is crazy, especially on a cold winter day. We waited about 25 min in the cold. You have to line up before you even see the host. Only once you actually get in do you get to ask to get a table.

I ordered the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. I don't think I enjoyed this as much as a did last time. I was a bit disappointed. The benny was good, but I found my dish a bit cold, and one of my eggs had broken when I received it. The hollandaise sauce on it was nice and creamy. I liked the potato hash that accompanied the benny. Serving a plate of fruit first, is smart so it didn't seem like we waited too long for our food.

My boyfriend got the chirizo benny, which I actually enjoyed more. The chirizo added a nice element to the dish.

The servers are super busy (there was only 3 of them, plus the 1 host/bus boy) and the place was super packed. But they were friendly. The service wasn't the fastest, but that was to be expected with the place so busy. The coffee was good, it was strong and served hot.

Decor: 4/5
I liked the funky decor of the place. Very artsy and colourful. There is motorcyle hanging from the ceiling and a manequin on display. The washroom is cool with the black light  and graffiti art. It's certainly the most unique restaurant washroom, I have ever visited. 
 
I liked the food...but not sure it was worth the 25 minute wait in the cold."}
{"text":"Really big portions! One is more than enough for 2.

Duck Benedict was tasty and flavourful.

Every plate comes with a side of fresh fruits.

Friendly service, food came quickly."}
{"text":"Consistency is one of the most difficult things to maintain and L'avenue definitely have some trouble doing that.

Came in with my friends for brunch. We each ordered a variant of the infamous eggs benedicts. We tried the duck confit, crab cake, and salmon versions. The salmon was just ok, while the duck confit was tasteless and dry. The crab cake was the best, or it just seemed that way because it was just better than the other two benedicts.

Usually I don't comment about appetizers that I didn't order, but the fruit plate was not good. The pineapple and melons were unripe and tasted extremely sour. 

I also understand this is a popular and busy place, but it doesn't justify subpar service. Our server was extremely slow and somewhat disengaged. During the middle of our ordering process , she went to help another table and then returned without apologizing. Okay, and then she asked us to repeat our entire order again since she forgot to write it down the first time. 

We had such high expectations of brunching at this Montreal icon, but from our experience, we are reluctant to ever come back."}
{"text":"Probably the most talked about brunch place in Montreal. It definitely lives up to the hype. 

Unless you get there right when they open, or even before then, get ready to stand in line for god knows how long. That being said, they're pretty efficient with getting people in and out, without being too overbearing. 

I ordered the Nutella French toast with the rum sauce and my girlfriend got a mixed plate of various brunch fare. They give you a little assorted fruit skewer before your food arrives. Adorable. 

The food was seriously amazing. I didn't think I would finish all of it, but I did and I was immediately ready for a nap. The French toast was so fluffy and airy, the sauce was very sweet without being too sweet, and they gave you a bunch of bananas to boot. My girlfriend really enjoyed her food as well. 

The only thing that was less than perfect (terrible, really) was the mojito. I don't know what the bartender did to my drink, but it was almost 3/4 full with straight mint, stems and all. It tasted like what I imagine Shrek's swamp water tastes like. Just way too minty and bitter. 

All in all, the food is great and the place is really cool. Make sure to check out the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Best egg-benedict I've ever had, literally. Visiting Montreal and came here with my friend who loves this place. This place does not disappoint! The waiter was super friendly and came by many times. Ordered the Smoked Meat and the Steak & Egg and shared a matcha green tea/banana/mango/ginger/yogurt juice. To my surprise I got a free plate of fruits (cantaloupe, watermelon, etc) and the egg benedicts came with yummy potatoes. Both the dishes were absolutely delicious. They have watermelon flavored water, and feel free to check in the back for their water tank with large slices of watermelon in it. The \"grafitti\" walls and decorations are also a sight. Do remember to come early in the morning as the place gets quite busy with lineups on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"L'Avenue is a quirky brunch spot that claims the title of most popular brunch spot in Plateau-Mont-Royal with consistent lines on the weekend.  Fortunately, things are slightly better on the weekdays but after 10 am, the place was still packed. 

The decor includes numerous mannequins and a menu with photos of various Canadian celebrities and random characters hawking the brunch specialties, including French toast and pancake offerings, Eggs Benedict variations galore, as well as burgers and sandwiches.  Portions are generous and include a skewer of fruit with pineapple, strawberry, cantaloupe, and orange. A well rounded drink menu included coffee, coconut milk, mimosas, and Bloody Caesars.  Our order:

I'll Take It All - $17.66. The kitchen sink of entrees that includes a pancake, French Toast, Sausage, bacon, baked beans, homemade crotons, pulled pork, pate,  and two eggs.  It's a great dish for sharing and sampling a lot of variety.  Everything was tasty including an incredibly fluffy pancake and  French toast that just tasted so good with the maple syrup. 

Duck Benedict - $16.92. A very Canadian variation on the Benedict with tender and savory duck confit meat combined with perfectly poached eggs, Hollandaise sauce and caramelized onions.  Very filling. The house potatoes are delicious too and they provide both mayo and ketchup for dipping. 

Overall, great brunch spot in the Plateau Mont Royal with friendly service, casual vibe and plentiful food for sharing.  

L'Avenue accepts credit cards including Amex."}
{"text":"Must dine here if you're visiting Montreal. I waited more than an hour in line outside in the rain and it was worth every minute!!! The staff was very friendly and courteous. The food was amazing and the decor was very hip. You get a lot food for you buck. Definitely will return!!"}
{"text":"Went this morning and got there early, so there was no wait.  We both ordered an omelette, his with a bagel, mine with brown bread.  While we waited, they served us each a fruit brochette.  Sadly it was put on a plate that was so hot out of the dishwasher it was still quite hot when it got to us.  The fruit was not great. I had a couple of pieces.  The cantaloupe was not really ripe, the banana was brown on the ends.  I gave up after that.  Finally the main meals arrived.  They looked good, but they really aren't omelettes.  They are more like frittatas.  There was their homemade sausage in mine, and I really enjoyed that.  The omelette was massive, but mediocre.  Not bad, just mediocre for the money.  The brown bread was a multigrain and it was great.  It had almost no butter on it though, which would have made it even better.  Service was weird.  We were served by a few different people, and everyone seemed to share every table.  This doesn't really make for good service.  It took quite a long time to have anyone notice we were done eating and clear our plate.  Most of the people who finished before us left with a take home container.  We ate half of our omelette each, yet when they cleared the plates no one asked if we wanted it to go.  Like the food, the service was not bad, just mediocre.  For the money and hype, I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"We waited for about 45mins to get in (two people, Saturday afternoon around 11). The wait time was the only ridiculous part of the experience to be honest, but I had read reviews before visiting so I was expecting a wait time of around 20mins. The food however was pretty great and presentation was lovely. I had a server named Alex and he honestly was amazing. Very fast service (especially considering how busy it was), and I saw him also bussing tables whenever he had an extra second. Many servers would take that little minute they have to check their phone but he was very hard working, so major props to him. It's because of servers like him, it makes the experience so great!
Overall, I would say the restaurant should think of ways to keep the restaurant flowing faster so people aren't waiting an hour outside for food."}
{"text":"Saturday morning 10 a.m., the line outside L'Avenue is already about 20 people long. Luckily for us, our buddy got there ahead of us, so there may have been 6 to 8 ahead of our party of 3.  When you're with friends, waiting isn't so bad, and hey, it wasn't raining!  Maybe 20 minutes, but then we were shown a BOOTH. Yay again!  
Lots and lots of eggs on this menu, decisions, decisions!  
I settle for the \"Bal aux Truffes\"  - scrambled eggs, truffle oil, three kinds of mushrooms...sounded delicious.
Let me tell you, it didn't disappoint!!  Unbelievably delicious!!
My two friends opted for two different variations of Eggs Benedict, must have been delicious also, not a crumb left on any plate!
Only criticism: noise level is pretty high, but the service was perfect.
Looking forward to the next experience!"}
{"text":"Great brunch restaurant! There will be a wait but we'll worth it and the line moves quite quickly. Lots of health options as well as the decedent specialty dishes. A must for brunch in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch with loads of healthy and comfort food options. There's always a bit of a wait from what I understand but the line tends to move quickly. The servers will not rush you out, but dinners seem to be pretty considerate of others waiting to enjoy a good meal. Service was quick and attentive. A must for brunch!"}
{"text":"So a lot of hype, go with it.  You will definitely enjoy this place!

After a brief wait in a cold Montreal day we made it in!  Followed the Yelp reviews to this breakfast and brunch place. It's definitely a cool joint, the decorations and bathroom black lights with the illuminated street graffiti makes it worth going in.

Duck Benedict 5 stars (get it, it's delicious)
The sweet and salty 5 stars best plate by far...
Bobby does Dallas 3 stars (unless you like sweet bbq sauce overpowering all other flavors, than it's perfect for you)
Marinated banana Nutella pancakes,  5 stars to die for!

Service 5 stars 
Food 5 stars
Ambiance 5 stars
Price 4 stars
Overall experience 5 stars

{"text":"Boy was the place worth the shivering, hopping around, and near frost-bite in the cold! As soon as my party was seated, we were given a large and diverse brunch menu. We were given a nice complimentary serving of fruit- which we greatly appreciated after our wait. Our waiter was quick in greeting and taking our orders as soon as we were ready. Fast forward: Each of our dishes were served warm, flavorful, and cooked exactly to our liking. Needless to say, each of us were heavily bloated after our meals."}
{"text":"What you heard about this place is true!!! Sacre bleu, their oeufs Benedictines are hands down the bestest..... So, so, sooo good!! Tres tres bon, j'adoreeeee! Huge portion size, hearty and flavorful hollandaise sauce, scrumptious veggies, creamy poached eggs...... just perfection. This is my top 3 brunch places in the world, I cannot express in words how much I love this place!  Come early before 11:00am if you wanna avoid the queue, it gets crowded even during weekdays. The decor is cool and trendy, and the Doors album that they kept playing somehow suits the ambiance. 

Believe the hype. This place is so legit. A must-visit brunch spot in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"This place is insane in terms of food! Its so good, great vibe and I am glad we tried it. The portions are huge. Loved both are dishes. We had eggs benedict and french toast! Good service also based on the fact that they are so busy. They give complimentary fruit. Overall, nice place with cool decor."}
{"text":"Very large portions and pretty tasty, but I don't think the lines don't quite match up to how good the food is. Don't get me wrong, my eggs benny over French toast, ham, and swiss (I know, right?) were filling and great, but it was mega greasy, heavy, sugary, salty, and too much of all the sensations. Not a lot of nuance in their food.

My voracious eater of a bf felt like he was going to puke afterwards, partly because it was a lot of food, but partly because it was just really oily and heavy.

Again, good for a hangover for sure. Worth the wait in the line outside? I dunno, maybe, if you don't mind killing some time."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot in North America and that is no exaggeration. Me and my wife travel all throughout the states and haven't come across a brunch place like this. The prices are right the portions are huge and the food is to die for. The Ambiance and service are really great."}
{"text":"Best brunch ever! The steak and frits with poached eggs is as good as it gets. The mimosas were excellent as well. If you are ever visiting Montreal, please don't hesitate to experience this amazing brunch!"}
{"text":"I usually over plan everything so my husband thinks it's ironic that he found this restaurant when the pastry shop that I dragged him to was closed .  Amazing breakfasts!! We actually went here right before leaving . It's that good . The first time we had the pear and chocolate French toast and the eggs Benedict with cheddar cheese and Carmelized onions . He loved his French toast . The best eggs Benny I ever had. Today we both had the eggs Benny . He had the classic and I the one with asparagus and red onions and mushrooms.  Simply the best hollandaise sauce ! The classic didn't have the usual slice of ham but ham braised in beer . It was more like pulled pork. The potatoes it comes with are just as good but one never gets to finish them because it's so filling. The skewer of fresh fruit that comes with it is  so fresh. They have great looking smoothies and delicious fresh squeezed juices. Don't miss this place. No wait if you get there before 9:30 Ina weekday."}
{"text":"This is the best brunch I had so far in Canada and Montreal.
Price are affordable and portion are serious.
I have taken a chicken spinach cheese omelet... All of the dishes come with a fruit salad. The service of welcoming and assisting for the wide variety of choices.
Strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch place, when you manage to site down... staff can be a bit rude/snobish but it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting L'Avenue while visiting Montreal and both times were great! The food was yummy. The smoked meats was so flavorful and tasty. Jezabelle was our server and she was amazing. She treated my family with great hospitality. I was visiting from NY and my French is not up to par, so she helped me translate the menu to make sure I ordered what I really intended to. lol. She also put us in a nice little corner where my fussy toddler could have a bit more space to spread out. Thank you for a good experience!"}
{"text":"I went few times to L'avenue on Mont Royal. One of my favorite brunch place. Recently, I went to L'Avenue on Notre Dame (near my place! Yay!). The place is bigger. Still as usual, full house. We waited about 20 minutes. Service was given by Laila. She was really amazing, despite being super busy, we felt she took care of us with sincerity. From the water(fruity flavor) to our dish, everything were succulent. The price is reasonable. I love the decor, very funky."}
{"text":"Beautiful little quaint joint with a varied and unique menu. Service was quick and friendly. The pancakes are to die for! Highly recommend. Also make sure you stop by their bathrooms"}
{"text":"Best brunch spot in Montreal! Love the black light bathrooms. Also, great service and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Brunch was a must in my visit to Montreal and L' avenue seemed like a perfect place for it. 

We arrived around 930 on a Friday with no issues getting a table immediately. When we left there was a good size line outside so definitely try to come early.

The interior is funky and the menu has a game show theme to it. To eat I had the wild mushroom and lardon benny and my friends ordered the indecisive and a 2 egg breakfast. We were also given a fresh fruit skewer prior to our food arriving. 

I am a sucker for eggs benny and l'avenue did not disappoint. The hollandaise was delicious and the eggs were poached perfectly. It was served with seasoned breakfast potatoes which were also fantastic. My friends also enjoyed their choices with no complaints. 

They also had mimosas with unique flavors. I tried a blueberry basil mimosa for scientific research purposes. 

A definite must stop in Montreal for breakfast and brunch lovers. Also check out the bathroom- definitely unique."}
{"text":"Watermelon water!!! This place is just awesome!! First time here. The service was good, coffee was great, food was even better! In a sea of mediocre, over priced brunch spots- especially in Griffintown, this place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Incredible. I've legitimately never been to a restaurant i love more. The staff is extremely nice and accommodating. I went there with all my family (a group of 12) and they served us with big smiles and never made us feel like we took too much room. The food and drinks are excellent, the decor is superb (everyone should visit the bathroom). This is a MUST if youre visiting montreal. Keep an eye out for the little touches (pink himalayen sea salt, watermelon infused water, the maple syrup served in cans...)"}
{"text":"First of all, WOW. If you go there for no other reason, go just to check out the decor and the badass washrooms. Hot! The main wall is covered in graffiti, and you can find a funky motorcycle suspended from the ceiling. I refer to their 'facilities' as the 'disco bathrooms' but you can check them out for yourself to see why :)

While we were waiting, the waiter brought over two fruit skewers, which we thought was a nice touch. The place was pretty packed so we welcomed the snack. I started with a smoothie (strawberries, raspberries, mint, basil) and it was delicious. Super fruity and served in a giant fish bowl glass, topped with (another) fruit skewer. So good!  They have a pretty extensive menu and I finally settled on La Biquette - an omelet stuffed with veggies and goat cheese, and accompanied by potatoes and yes,  another fruit skewer. My omelet was huge - way too big for one person and I felt that it was a bit of a waste to make such big omelets only to leave half of them on your plate (I know - who complains about a portion being too big, right? Me, that's who!). That said, I didn't realize that it was a 4-egg omelet until my friend pointed it out so next time, I'll ask for a 2-egg omelet and hopefully they will be able to accommodate. The omelet was well-stuffed with veggies and cheese but if you didn't grab some cheese with those veggies, it was a little lacking in flavor. The potatoes were very tasty.

L'Avenue is a hot spot, so expect a line-up. We got there around 11:30 on a Saturday, and didn't have to wait too long for a table."}
{"text":"A l'image de l'Avenue sur Mont Royal, l'Avenue Notre-Dame est un endroit cool, stylé, tendance, ou on est bien servi et ou on mange bien! Petite différence: on y attend un peu moins dans la line up (compter 30mn VS 1h sur Mont Royal..)
Même menu qu'à Mont Royal, c'est à dire large choix de brunchs sucrés, salés, drinks, bref, il y en a pour tous les goûts, et tous les budgets! (le brunch le moins cher est autour de 9$ et le plus cher autour de 20 il me semble..)
Il y a aussi des cocktails alcoolisés de type mimosas..
Bref, à essayer à tout prix!! :)"}
{"text":"It's the busiest place on the street, maybe in the whole city. 

Interesting deep menu filled with great food, and service at a reasonable price. 

The Huevos Rancheros is so far from what an actual huevos rancheros is(it was really an egg burrito) but it's still good. The potato side was boring, but the menu is so interesting that I'd come back. The nutella coffee is awesome!

Get here early! or wait hours."}
{"text":"Best brunch spot in town. Eggs Bene with chorizo will bring a tear to your eye, a happy one."}
{"text":"Great vibe. A modern, quirky take on amazing breakfast. One of the most unique restaurants I've been to. The food is also quite good. Four stars because I found the food too heavy and very salty. The rainbow salmon eggs Benedict gave a bit of nausea. Would not recommend. Friends got burgers, poutines and sandwiches, which were all fantastic. Get a traditional eggs benny if you're in the mood instead."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! I will forever dream about this place. Honestly.

The decor is quirky and fun, something I haven't seen for a breakfast place but I loved it.

Their service was amazing. We were greeted at the door and immediately taken to our seats. Our server checked on us frequently and asked if we needed condiments before we had a chance to ask for them.

When you first walk in they bring you watermelon infused water - YUM! I had an orange juice which tasted very fresh, and my boyfriend had a mango/pineapple/lychee smoothie that made me wish I had ordered one.

I then had the fruity breakfast. It was a huge cup of assorted fruit (melons, berries, dragon fruit and star fruit), French toast, eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast. All of this for $15 Canadian dollars!!!

I left feeling satisfied and wishing we had a place similar in the states. This place knows how to do breakfast, and you need to experience it for yourself.

Side note: they have a second location that opened about a year ago, but while there, another guest said that it wasn't as good. I would travel to this location!"}
{"text":"There was a long line to wait through which took about 40 minutes. The food was good but probably not worth the wait so go earlier. The inside looks amazing. Every dish seems to come with fruits which is a plus."}
{"text":"So I went in for dinner yesterday. Tried their Irish stew Sheppard's pie. The price mark at $18 seemed high but it turned out to be more than enough for two and the flavors were perfect. Perfect thing for a winter night. This place is worth checking for suppers. The burgers looked amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch place. Food is delicious and creative. Wish I did brunch more often..."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast 
Wish we had something similar in LA 
Bobby does Dallas and chorizo Benedict was just perfect"}
{"text":"Amazing benedict on French toast! Staff are attentive and friendly. Smoothies are at good value!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 10 stars.  It is hands down the best restaurant for breakfast in the world.  This time around I had eggs with mushroom and truffle on brioche.  There were easily 2 pounds of mushrooms on top.  My wife had an omelette with goat cheese, asparagus, and other veggies.  

We went on the weekend this time and there was definitely some electronica music playing the whole time but it wasn't annoying like some other reviewers have said."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. 

Yum. 

I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing. The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food. I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window. He was very friendly and helpful. 

I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top. The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting. The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate. 

I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant). She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge). 

I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome. There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ 

I will definitely be back here. I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup."}
{"text":"Excellents brunchs, avec choix variés et originaux; il y en a pour tous les gouts et il y a des variantes originales (plein de sortes de bénédictines, des choix végé,..). Les plats sont copieux et de qualité, il y a des petites touches finales et des saveurs qui rendent les plats vraiment savoureux. Le service est très bon, rapide malgré le monde. Il y a du monde mais on ne se sent pas les uns sur les autres. L'ambiance et le décor sont vraiment cool aussi.
Bref, le seul petit hic de l'endroit est l'attente... 1h de line up environ la fin de semaine"}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say, this place is amazing. I'm usually not a fan of breakfast, as I don't like the variety of food that they offer for breakfast (eating eggs, jam and fruits in the morning isn't really my thing and also, waking up early neither) but this place has conquered my heart. I ordered the chorizo eggs benedict and it was delicious. They're very generous with their portions! I couldn't finish the whole thing. You get your money's worth, every single bite felt like a stop to heaven. Also, the service is great, my waitress was very nice and friendly and the ambience was great. I don't think this will make me want to wake up early every morning to get breakfast, but it's nice to know that there's some place worth sacrificing your beauty sleep once in a while ;) L'avenue is probably one of them. 

Ps : try to get there as early as possible to avoid the line up. I went around 8h30 and noticed that around 9am, it starts to get packed."}
{"text":"J'avais un préjugé négatif sur l'Avenue avant d'y aller pour une première fois. Je trouvais un peu stupide d'attendre dehors parfois 30 minutes pour un brunch. J'ai depuis changé d'idée. La sauce bénédictine à elle seule vaut le détour"}
{"text":"Lavenue is THE PLACE if you want an amazing breakfast/brunch. It great for those post-hangover Sundays. They serve up generous portions of greasy grub that you can`t find anywhere else. I had the sweet and salty French toast which was to die for. 
Their smoothies and milkshakes are like no other. First off, they taste fresh and delicious and secondly they're HUGE. I have a hard time finishing them.

The only thing that sucks about this place is the line-up. I wish they would expand and add more tables given they are so popular. The wait on the weekend is minimum 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with this place!

After landing at Montreal airport around 9:00am, my friend and I headed straight to L'Avenue for breakfast. She randomly came across it on her Google search and based on the reviews, we decided to check it out.

I couldn't have chosen a better way to start off my weekend trip to Montreal! THIS PLACE IS OUTSTANDING! Like, I still don't even know where to begin. Should I discuss the amazing customer service, trippy/ eclectic bathroom, or finger/plate-licking food? I'm not sure!

Let's start with the service! Based on the reviews, it mentioned that the wait would be long and the house would be packed, which I thought would mean less-than-great service. However, it was quite the opposite. We had a friendly employee come out every 10-15 minutes to let us know how long it'd be before we could enter the restaurant and be seated. Once inside, we were brought water and asked if we'd like bread and fruit as our appetizer, which we were much obliged.

The menu: extensive AF! There's something on there for everybody. Vegetarian friendly, as well! After 7 minutes of flipping the pages back and forth, I decided on the \"undecided\" portion of the menu, which meant I could choose a savory and a sweet dish for my combo. I settled on the Whole Wheat Carrot Cake Pancakes with a Maple Syrup and Cream Cheese Sauce for my sweet, along with the Roasted Potatoes for my savory. I can't forget to mention that a side of fruit and cheddar cheese came with the entree, too! By the time my entree came out, I was half asleep at the table. On the verge of a food coma! No exaggeration. The food was outstanding. Haven't had such hearty and scrumptious pancakes like that in a while! It was such a delicious brunch!

Oh, I gotta mention the bathroom. Yes--the restaurant's bathroom. It is part of the frickin experience, man! You go in there and you feel like you're in rave or interactive arcade or escape room or Japanese light show/art exhibition. It's pretty dope and funky! Nice photo op.

My friend also enjoyed her time at L'Avenue. She isn't gluttonous like me, so she stopped eating after the starter and saved her entree for dinner that night. I can't wait to come back and visit this gem. Like Kathy N. said in her comment, this place is \"ONE OF THE BEST.\" Thanks for the hospitality, L'Avenue!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge so be prepared to eat. I enjoyed the chicken eggs Benedict. The potatoes are great full of flavor. Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Epic quest for one of the city's unique spot on a Sunday morning.

1:00 pm: Brunch?
1:30 pm: Arrived in front of l'Avenue and the line goes all the way to the end of the block. It is pouring outside
3:00 pm: we are inside.

A baroque place with street art influences overhung by an actual motorcycle attached to the ceiling and rocked by an electro DJ set. Loud vocal chords are recommended to communicate. 

Then comes the food... and I am full at 3:30 pm. Honestly, very rich menu providing you with unique egg combinations such as benedicts and chorizo. Juices are amazing and I recommend the orange-yogurt-maple sirup freshly squeezed mix. And next time I will get these Mimosa pitchers for sure. Your hangover will not resist to such a heavy brunch and a very pleasant service.

However, numbers speak for themselves: you will wait a long time unless you go there during the week. More, waiters might prioritize their tectonik practice over getting tables ready in timely manners. Yes, I witnessed an extremely deep V-neck taking actually 15 minutes to clear a single table while dancing. Perhaps economics would be welcome here.

Anyway. FULL. I WANT MY LARRY."}
{"text":"Okay, I succumbed to the bandwagon and waited my ass in line to try L'Avenue, and it was totally worth it! On chilly Sunday after my engagement, our friends from Austin and D.C. wanted to try an iconic brunch spot. Brunch has not really blown my socks off in Montreal. The dinner, dessert, and cafe scene are definitely its stronger suits. But on this day, that all changed. We stood in line for about half an hour, which isn't all that bad because you meet people and become friendly with the crowd pretty quickly. Once inside, we all tried our hands at different breakfast drinks. My buddy got some mimosas, another ordered a coffee, and I opted for a delicious mango, lichee, pineapple smoothie that tasted oh so fresh (despite it being the last week of January)!
The lingering memory of their decadent French Toast is still on my mind. I'll definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Amazing Place!!! Best place for brunch in Montreal for sure! 

We got salmon and eggs it was delicious! We also had beer which was also really good! 

Prices are super reasonable and service was amazing!!! 

You can't go wrong with L'Avenue for Brunch!!!"}
{"text":"Waiting outside in winter isn't ideal however, once you make it in this place has an abundance of great breakfast choices. The downfall: if you don't understand French, there's no English menu to accommodate. You can't go wrong with any of their eggs Benedict selections. The smoothies seemed to be a large hit around the restaurant as well..next time!"}
{"text":"This is a great brunch restaurant. The decor is pretty slick with graffiti on the walls (not to mention a motorcycle) in the front and rounded booth seating with mod lighting in the back. Not to mention the dim red lighting in the bathroom with big mirrors and a tv in the wall (it was playing Dark Knight when I was there). Good music, too (although probably a good idea to avoid it if you're hung over).

Now on to the food. There's a good choice of brunch options that ranges from pancakes to eggs benedicts and even a breakfast burrito topped with guac. I ordered the latter and it came with a skewer of fresh fruit (a big step up from the regular slice of melon and orange) and delicious garlic rosemary potatoes. The servings are generous.

Be prepared to wait in line and budget at least $15 per person."}
{"text":"We came on a chilly Wednesday lunch hour in December and there was still a line up outside. We waited for about 20 mins but were pretty lucky that a large group left so our group of 6 were able to get seated ahead of others who were ahead of us in line. 

Decor has a retro vibe and everyone says to go visit the washrooms - go do it. Most (if not all, I'm not sure) comes with fruit to start and they're all pretty fresh. Even their water for the table is infused with watermelon!

Ordered the chorizo eggs benedict and it was delicious! Super filing and couldn't finish the potatoes. Also tried the wife's Grand Marnier creme brulee French Toast and hands down was the best French toast we've ever had.

Without drinks you'll probably spend over $20 a person after tips. Totally worth it and you'll be full for hours"}
{"text":"Brunch is the best meal of the week. I challenge anyone to prove otherwise. It is so life affirming a meal especially after a long hard week.

1 hour wait to share the glory. It was well worth it.

We were in town for Osheaga. Heard loads about this place before but never had the chance to visit. 

This time I went twice. Each time the eggs benny was stellar

The first one I had was the Chorizio Sausage, the second time was the steak Eggs Benny. Utterly amazing, the most tender steak and the best roasted flavoured chorizio sausage you will ever put in your mouth. 

Usually the home fries are nothing to write home about but they were stellar. They were roasted in garlic / oregano and other spices. 

I loved the fruit skewer it just made it seem all the more exciting to eat. 

I also ordered the infamous Bacon Cheddar Apple pancakes...

These things changed my life, I dont think I have ever put anything in my mouth so wonderful save for past lovers...

amazing.

Dont be naysayer or a lazy bum. Visit this place and do your culinary fantasies a favour."}
{"text":"We found this place through yelp before our trip back to the states but it was definitely a highlight of our trip. Once I saw a line outside, I knew this place was worth it. We waited about 30 minutes in the cold but it was worth it. As soon as we were seated, the waitress offered us a champagne bottle due to the wait. The menu can be a bit intimidating due to the many great choices. The food was great and the sides were tasty! The portions are large and our server was very attentive. Worth the drive and the wait."}
{"text":"I mean, food was amazing, incredible. Best breakfast food ever. However, what I enjoyed the most had nothing to do with it. You see, we were sitting at this booth which happened to be right in front of the washrooms that have kinda ambiguous bathroom signs, so you're never quite sure if you're going into the right bathroom. We spent an hour and a half looking at people trying to figure out what bathroom was which and hoping they got it right. People would stand there, stare at one door, stare at the other. Some people would just go back to their table, defeated. Some others would just eenie-meenie-miney-mo it and hope for the best. When I saw the line outside and then waited for like an hour, I was expecting good food, but this really blew my mind. Best brunch ever. 

This is what I call added value."}
{"text":"Easter Weekend - 2011

I read quite a few review you have to get there early. I guess when we went we got lucky. Didn't have to wait that long may be about 5 mins for the guy to clean the table. 

As soon as you walk in you can hear the music blasting. Let put it this way you can call this a day club. They were playing way better music then most club in Toronto. The setting of the restaurant was pretty cool. My girl friend and me look at each other and said this will be a hit on King West in Toronto. 

Anyway, if you don't know by now. This Restaurant is located on the French side of Montreal. Don't expect menu etc to be in English. The server know enough English to take your order or just point Haha  :-)

The Food was GREAT. My girl friend had some fruit juice and some yogurt fruit meal. I had some chicken egg benedict. It was AWESOME. Might be little spicy for some. But perfect for me. They had a bar there. Beside serving fruit juice I think they guy was serving booze too. LOL talk about those party frenchie. 

Don't expect to get 3.99 for breakfast special here :-) For two of us I think the bill came up to be around $40.00 with tips. Its worth it. If you around this neighbourhood in MTL. You should stop by.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Very very yummy. We each had eggs Benedict. However, my plate was not exactly warm. Moreover, the dishes are covered in a film of soap...less fun."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast as it was greatly recommended on Yelp! It was an amazing place! The portion was really big for the price we paid and the food were so delicious! The fruit was so refreshing!!!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Seriously the hype is real. I had the best smoked salmon benedict I've ever had so far! The line up might be a turn off, so come early! We arrived at about 9ish and still waited almost 30 minutes. They also provide you English menus, so if you want you can request for one, or if the server hears you speaking English they'll hand one to you lol. 

The smoked salmon benedict was cooked to perfection, and the hollandaise sauce was really creamy. I'd say it's a big portion but I devoured mine because it was that good! 

I would definitely come back again for breakfast or brunch the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. So tasty. So amazing. 

We go here at every available opportunity, and never once have we been dissatisfied. They literally have the best Benedicts I've ever had."}
{"text":"Ok on va se le dire il y a t'il une file interminable, mais bon une fois à l'intérieur on es bien accueilli. Les toilettes sont Tripp's tes télés déjeuners toujours délicieux, portion immense alors apportez votre appétit"}
{"text":"Wow - YUM! We arrived on the morning of August 11th a few minutes before 10am and I was slightly discouraged that there was already a line outside. Most of the people waiting in line were groups of six or more so our wait was 15 minutes for a table for two. I heard the wait for larger parties towards the back of the line was over an hour.

The inside vibe is \"trendy\" and \"hip\" with ridiculously huge portions of food sitting in front of people struggling to conquer their entrée. The prices are higher than other places but you basically get two meals out of whatever you order cause it's just that big.

If you don't speak French, don't be discouraged by the non-translated menu on the website, they have English menus inside the restaurant. I ordered the French Toast with strawberries, blueberries and bananas topped with a dolce de leche whipped cream. The hubby ordered the Bobby Does Dallas. Both entrees were amazing and yes, we had our breakfast for the next day already planned with our leftovers. The service is great and the OJ is really fresh-squeezed. I highly recommend stopping by L'Avenue for breakfast while in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best brunch in Montreal so far

I taught Regine cafe was the best, but this restaurant just steal the 1rst lace in my list. 

Decor is eclectic. The water is watermelon flavored. The milkshake are to die for. The syrup is the real maple syrup. 

The portion are huge. I didn't finish my plate.  We were 6 and we had a great time. 

Just 3 words: Amazing, Amazing, Amazing"}
{"text":"The food was great; my friend had a duck and brie cheese omelette that was surprisingly heavenly! However...we waited 2 hours to get in. And the waiters take so long delivering food, I stared at numerous benedicts waiting to be served at the kitchen. 

The food is good, but the service put a downer on the experience. Not sure if it's possible to make reservations, but you probably should!"}
{"text":"If time is not a constraint than the food is well worth the wait if you're looking to enjoy excellent French cuisine for breakfast or lunch. I had the duck confit omelet and can easily say it was one of the best omelets I've had. It was cooked with brie and green apples, the flavors blended together very well. The side of baked potatoes complemented the dish perfectly. 
Furthermore, L'Avenue has got the coolest bathrooms of any restaurant I've ever eaten at.

I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for breakfast/lunch in Montreal, but not in a rush."}
{"text":"We decided to go to this place after seeing the many positive reviews on Yelp.  Although we knew the wait would be long and we'd have to stand outside, we thought it was worth a try.  Yes the inside is trendy, staff is pleasant and the food is very good.  After waiting for almost an hour in the freezing cold, I decided to go with a Bloody Mary which was tasty and well presented.  The problem with the wait is that you have no idea when you will get seated and there is no waiting area inside which is much needed.

If you're visiting Montreal in the summer, definitely go otherwise its not \"worth the wait\"."}
{"text":"Now here's a happy accident! A popular place in the area was closed for brunch only for us to find out at the restaurant doorstep. Major bummer, right? We scrambled around for a decent place and were led to L'Avenue. A line was forming out the door so we too, had to fall in. 

Half an hour later of standing out in the cold, a table opens up for two. Booyah! We walked in to a warm and vibrant atmosphere of brunchers and their libations in hand. It was the weekend after all! My friend and I were more than happy to join in the fun. The place was packed, loud, and colorful! It felt like one big party was going on inside and I loved every bit of the vibe in the room. 

Our server was very French and so was the menu. No English menu available. Sure I could read some of the ingredients but who was I kidding?! I was starving and had no intention on doing a refresher of culinary French terms. Our very kind and quick server explained the menu to us so graciously and led us to order two kinds of eggs benedict that we will remember for quite some time...

STEAK and EGGS. Wow! It was a beautiful plate full of promise. One bite and I was in heaven. Meat was tender and amazingly flavorful. The hollandaise sauce was fantastic. The egg, ohhh the egg! I cut into it and it was oozing with yellow silky yolk all over my plate. What a sight that was to behold. 

EGGS BENEDICT on FRENCH TOAST. Ahhhmazing! The perfect combination of sweet and savory in every spoonful. The toast was fluffy with a nice touch of \"coconutty\" sweetness while the ham, egg, and sauce had enough brine to let each ingredient shine. Yeah, that rhymed! Can't decide which one I like better but these two Bennies are without a doubt the best I've had, just yet.

Servings are quite large but they're so good you'll end up finishing it anyway. My friend and I had one of each since an order comes with two pieces. Perfect sharing item, indeed. Both came with delicious rosemary seasoned potatoes and fresh fruits on the side. How complete can that brunch be? 

On that note, let's not forget how fantastic their mimosas were. Freshly squeezed OJ with some pulp and the right ratio of champagne to juice. Cheers! 

To wait out in the cold was a pain but I would have done it all over again on this same trip if only time was our friend in this city. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to brunch at this place for some time but was completely turned off by the line up. I came the first time with my daughter and after seeing the line outside I didn't think it a good idea to wait out in the cold with her. However, I dragged my husband the second time out in the cold just to see what the hype was about. We waited about 25-30 mins outside on a Saturday morning. I ordered the Breton eggs Benedict and my husband got an omelet. My favourite part of the meal was the potatoes and smoothie. Unfortunately everything else was underwhelming and I think it's mostly due to all the hype this place gets. The French toast was good but felt so heavy after a few bites. Overall the food is good, but not better than many other brunch places Montreal has to offer."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and we ordered the Fruitty Breakfast and an a la carte plate. So much fresh fruit, yummm. Incredibly happy with my fruitty breakfast and watermelon water! Ordered the Spinach combo juice, a little bit too sweet. The hash browns were to die for. Bathroom was dope. All in all, great little place for breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"Pour vrai, j'ai détesté l'endroit jusqu'à temps que j'y aille pour la première fois. J'étais principalement \" off \" à cause des longues files d'attente chaque fois que j'ai voulu y aller. Par chance, ce matin, nous nous somme levé un peu plus tôt (un samedi), et on a arrivé pour faire la file vers 10 h. Nous avons à peine attendu 25 minutes avant d'être assis. 

Pour ce qui est du service, franchement, impeccable. Rien à dire! Le refill d'eau et café à souhait, et nous avons eu les assiettes assez rapidement. 

Côté plats, wow. Nous étions les deux à commander l'Indécis avec des options différents et sérieusement, it did not disappoint. Les patates sont tellement bonnes et goûteuses, le cretton est succulent et les fruits très frais. Leurs pancakes au gâteau aux carottes qui venait avec mon assiette était un pur délice. J'vous jure que j'exagère pas quand je dis que c'était vraiment très bon. 

Leur smoothies sont également bons, définitivement à essayer si c'est votre première fois. 

C'est un peu dispendieux mais une fois de temps en temps quand t'as envie de faire la file pour ce genre de brunch, c'est totally worth it. 

Ps. Les toilettes sont quand même très drôles et originales!

Somme toute, allez y! Soyez pas découragés par la file, ça vaut vraiment le coup."}
{"text":"The line-up was worth the wait.

Arriving on a Saturday morning at 10am one would expect to wait for a table for two. We waited for about 30 minutes and it went quick.

The atmosphere and the staff were both pleasant and inviting. My French isn't so good but I went to the most popular item on the menu: French Toast benedict. This is one of the best things I've ever eaten.

The mimosas we refreshing and the food arrived hot and quick.

For anyone visiting or living in Montréal, this is a must visit.

5 stars all around"}
{"text":"After a long road trip to Montreal from Ontario, my partner and I decided to stop here for food. We were super hungry. 

There was a line outside the place, of course. You go to one of the notoriously popular brunch places on yelp, so what do you expect, right? We didn't mind waiting about 15 to 20 minutes to eat here. It's one of those bucket list places we put on the list beforehand. 

It was really busy and service wasn't very attentive. But mind you, we came around 45 minutes til closing and it was PACKED. 

We got our food in a timely manner, though. Really appreciated that considering we only had about 25 minutes to eat before they closed. Talk about a close call! 

 I got the smoked salmon eggs benny - holy mother of God this was the most delicious thing ever! It hit all the notes and it was heavy. In the best way. I don't think I ate another meal after finishing my eggs benny. They give you a fruit skewer thing but pff, this blew everything out of the water. I don't think I finished my potatoes because I was so full but they were really delicious.

I didn't know about the infamous bathroom here so when I walked in, I was a taken aback. It's a wonderfully cool but frightening place! Kinda reminded me of a David Lynch situation but a lot more modern. Still really weird. But I liked it!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Delicious food, generous portions. Great ambiance, funky bathrooms. What more could you want in a brunch spot?"}
{"text":"Absolutely must every time I visit Montreal. The wait in line, even during the winter, is always worth it. 

I can't even express how much I like this place. Small, but great atmosphere and friendly staff. Good food and great variety. Be sure to check out their bathrooms. It's so unique, i think it changes everytime i go there!"}
{"text":"The other reviews aren't lying, this place is incredible!

Some of the older reviews mention the servers not willing to speak english to them - that was not our experience whatsoever. As far as I could tell (and between the four staff I interacted with) every employee was bilingual. 

We went on the Monday after Osheaga and waited for approximately 50 minutes, then another 30 or so for our food. I truly hate waiting, but this was worth the wait. The food was divine. My boyfriend and I both had the Steak and Eggs Benedict, absolutely to die for, and one of, if not, the best Benny's I've ever had. I saved the leftover potatoes, mushrooms, steak and hollandaise and made an incredible hash. Bonus: the coffee is only $1.48. 

Tried and true: when you're good at one thing, stick with it, perfect it, and do only that. L'avenue is the *best* at breakfast, and completely worth five stars. 

Kudos to whoever designs the decor and menus, clearly there is a lot of thought and an incredible attention to detail. It is noticed and appreciated!"}
{"text":"L'Avenue was on everyone's recommendation list for Montreal. Too bad for us, we went on one of the busiest weekends of the year, and waited 1.5 hours for brunch. Despite the good food, I probably would think twice before coming back again.

I ordered the Indecisive, which comes with 2 savoury items (I chose the sausage and baked beans) and 1 sweet item (Nutella strawberry french toast for me). I thought the savoury items were mediocre, with the baked beans a bit cold for my liking. The standout item for me was definitely the french toast - the combination of toast, fresh strawberries, nutella, whip cream, and maple syrup is heavenly. I devoured it eagerly, despite the big serving portion. In hindsight, I did not feel like the dish was too unique, but I know there are more creative french toast options in their menu. I also heard great things about their eggs benedict here and it's a shame we never got to try it. 

I find my time to be too precious to wait in line for that long again, but certainly I would recommend coming here right when they open at 8am."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast spot. I have been meaning to check it our for a while but I'm not one to wait in line (which is pretty much constant at the entrance here). Today I decided to take my parents who are visiting us in Montreal, since it's just five minutes away, and we were early enough to avoid the line (we got there at about 9 am on a Thursday). It's a pretty expensive breakfast (our meal was about $80 for four), but they are using very good ingredients, and the portions are hhhuge. Everyone were super happy with what they got, and only my dad and I were able to overcome the entire plate. The coffee is good, and they also make nice fruit juices and shakes. The water taste of watermelon :) and the service was fantastic - very quick and attentive. If you are looking for a special breakfast place, I do recommend this one!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Well worth the wait! The food was suuuper good, the ambience is very neat, the people working there are super friendly. The bathrooms are... an experience! Definitely need to check this place out"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fun atmosphere! Found this place on Yelp! And based on reviews and other reviewers photos decided we needed to try it out. I couldn't have been more pleased. We got there shortly after opening, so we were easily seated, as we were getting ready to leave there was a line at the door! Glad we came early, the food was excellent, staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"ceci est le restaurant toujours bonder la fin de semaine. Même a -40 les gens font la fils pour avoir une place au chaud. Le menu est très complet se qui rend la tache doublement difficile. Apres avoir longuement hésiter j'ai été avec les ufs bénédictine sucré salé. Très bon le gout du sirop étais bien présent, la hollandaise bien onctueuse et les ufs poché a points. seul petit b.mot le fromage gruyère n'étais pas assé goûteux pour vraiment avoir le contraste sucé salé.
Je comprend après ma visite maintenant toute l'achalandage qu'ils ont.
Coup de cur pour les toilettes originales"}
{"text":"The. Best. Breakfast.  I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.  Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door/draft!).  Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.  Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way).
Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.  The homefries: perfectly seasoned.  The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.  The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.  It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank.
Whatever you do......go to the bathroom.  The coolest pee experience you'll ever have (unless you've used those one-way-mirror public potties....in which case this will be the SECOND best pee experience!).  No more hints.....just enjoy...."}
{"text":"Loud music, crowded hip environment, good service. 

Food is excellent and was one of our Montreal trip highlights.

There usually a line. It moved along and we are glad we waited."}
{"text":"The service is great, food is delicious indescribable, the only problem is the line up of 30-45 minutes waiting outside principally when is raining or super cold... but the food worth the wait"}
{"text":"Look. Yes, there's a line out the door almost always. But you know what? There's a reason. My parents, my boyfriend and I almost let the line intimidate us out of going, but we got strategic about it and showed up close to opening time on a Friday. It was perfect. We got a table right away, and quickly received 4 mountains of delicious, eggy foods that probably took years from our lives but it was worth it. I got the truffle omelette (yum). My parents both got Bobby Visits Spain (I think that's the translation?) and looked overwhelmed but overjoyed. My boyfriend went for the Indecisive option and had eggs, sausage, and carrot cake pancakes. All of it was unreal. Plus, service was friendly and the ambiance was fun. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal--it deserves its popularity."}
{"text":"Ahh what can I say about this place? Where do I even start? In a nutshell, I love everything about it!!! It can be quite discouraging seeing a huge line to get into the restaurant but it is totally worth the wait. The service is excellent and fast despite it being packed. The food...oh my god...the food... Let me start off by saying even the water was delicious. Yes, the water tasted like watermelon. Little things like this make me so happy. You even get a small plate of fruit before your breakfast arrives.The portions are VERY generous. I ordered the Beautiful Truffle and my plate was overflowing. It was delicious. My friend had the eggs benedict and she also enjoyed it. This place is definitely a gem that you have to visit."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to try this amazing breakfast venue and was totally amazed at how excellent the food was. It definately lived up to it's reputation as being one of the best breakfast places in Montreal. I recommend going before 10:30 am if you are a group. The max group they can fit is a table of 8. After 10:30 the line risks to be longer but well worth the wait! The resto itself is cozy and orginally decorated with graffiti like painting on the walls. The service is super-friendly and welcoming. Now to the food ..absolutely mouthwatering!  The eggs Benedict dishes are truly unlike any other I have tasted and truly wonderful. I would definately recommend to try at least once.as for myself I shall definately go back even if there is a lineup!  Worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch spot on a quiet street in the Saint-Henri neighbourhood. Coffee is mild and not too bitter (unlimited as well). The hollandaise sauce that is served with the Egg's Benedict is a must try."}
{"text":"I was committed to eating here at least once during my trip so I came here at 10am on a Monday morning so I wouldn't have to wait for a table. This place gets really busy by 11am so get in early if you want to avoid the long wait. 

Enormous portions on their dishes, I would highly recommend sharing. The sweet-savoury-crunchy is a must try. It's crusted French toast, cheese, poached eggs, ham, and hollandaise sauce. ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. Huevos rancheros burrito is fantastic as well. The carrot cake pancakes are super moist, but the real star is the cream cheese icing. Crab cake Benedict is also a nice spin on the classic brunch dish. 

Definitely a must try when you're in Montreal. Wake up early so you don't have to wait at least an hour in line."}
{"text":"2 words - Eggs Benedict. It is probably the best eggs benedict in the world here. Their Hollandaise sauce = dreamy. There is a whole page of eggs benny to choose from. There is a line up for brunch if you arrive later than opening. Worth the wait. If you don't want to wait as long, arrive at opening. Decor changes now and then including the costumes worn by the servers. The bathroom is really trippy. They play loud music and there are lots of people. Great energy, great food. What more can you ask for? I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Egg Benedict is really nice. I ordered 'Rainbow'. It tasted awesome."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly. The food itself was awesome, bagel with salmon was delicious, giant capers were a great touch."}
{"text":"Super endroit, brunch à tomber par terre! Service sympathique, avec le sourire et la bonne humeur."}
{"text":"Greatness all the way around. Beware, there is always a line outside so don't wait to try another time when you see it.. it is worth the wait and the line moves really quick.

I came up to Montreal to visit a few friends staying in Montreal for the summer and the 1st place (and last!) we went was Restaurant l'avenue, believe me it did not disappoint. 

You must get the smoothies! They are HUGE... like you should probably share it with whomever you are with because it is practically a meal in itself. I had an oreo milkshake with my breakfast on our last day (ya, aren't I a healthy eater ;)) haha. The milkshake was so thick and wonderful - like your dream frappe-ish milkshake. 

One note - be prepared all you non-french speaking Americans (like myself), the menu is in French.. no english here buddy. I had a benedict with french toast the first time. You know me - I love that sweet and savory. ;) It was really good and the food came out quickly. The breakfast potatoes are BOMB... no but really they are so good. 

Of course the maple syrup is real... obviously, this is Canada folks, and it comes out in cute little cans. My breakfast on the last day of our trip was a ham and cheese crepe. It was cheesy gooey magic but the benedict was better. They are legend for them apparently and I can see why. YUM."}
{"text":"After waiting in line outside in the cold Montreal winter for 30 minutes and finally being seated at a small table with 2 tables on either side of it, approx. 3 inches away, I was not in the most open mood and was thinking this place might've been too overhyped.

Oh sweet Jesus was I wrong. Best breakfast I've ever (or probably will ever) have. I had the Chorizo Eggs Benedict and I can't even express how delicious it was. Those potatoes are the best potatoes of any kind I've ever had. I'm still upset I had to leave some in the bowl because I was so full from the amount of food. Even the English Muffin at the bottom of the eggs benedict was somehow mindblowingly good.

My guest had french toast with his meal which I was able to try and it's sweet fluffy deliciousness was something to behold. I don't even like french toast that much! He also had a latte which was also made incredibly well. And the regular white toast must've been in-house made because it was also incredible. Somehow this place took white bread and a latte and made it something worth commenting on.

Also, the rumours are true about the bathroom. Take a visit even if you don't have to go. It's a pretty psychedelic experience."}
{"text":"I don't have many 5 star reviews but gosh darn this was amazing food. Can't believe I've never eaten here before. Also, for the smart people out there, do not pay too much attention with the bike hanging from the ceiling. The engineer in me kept getting distracted by it and almost ruined my date."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best eggs benedicts I've ever had! The portions are huge and they come with a fruit skewer, which is a nice addition. We got the saint ambroise Benedict and wild mushroom and lardon Benedict. They were delicious!! Our favorite of the two was the mushroom and lardon benedict. Left happy and quite full. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the name of the game here.  The lunch menu only has a few items.  The breakfast are very large so two orders could be shared by three people easily.  Also, the sweet items are very sweet so you don't need as much but the pretzel pancake was good.  We had that as a small order and it got too sweet to finish.  The unlimited coffee was ok but very cheap at $1.48.  We also had the sweet crunchy benny and truffle eggs.  Both taste great and interesting.  Also, like everyone says, go see the bathrooms.  It is pretty neat and they blast ac in there so it doesn't stink (as much).  This place was more of an experience than a restaurant.  Worth the wait since the line goes fast.  The restaurant is fairly large and deep so it goes by quickly."}
{"text":"Go as early as you can before it opens! the line ups are crazy! On Victoria day we waited for 45 mins and the line piled up even longer within 15mins and by the time we were done, people were lining up in the rain! 

The food was delicious! Quality and portions were fantastic! I even took half of my bobby does dallas for the road trip home. My friend really enjoyed the sweet savory benny, still amazed how soft it was on the inside and crunchy on the outside. 

TIP- buy the maple syrup to go because its one of the best we tried!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday, so there was no line up, but the place was almost full. Fun interior, original menu. As the waitress showed us our table, I peeked on tables around and tbh everything looked good. In the end, I picked the eggs benedict with duck confit, which also included fruits.
- eggs benedict with duck confit: the portion is really big, I could barely finish it. The potato that came with it was SO FREAKING GOOD! Probably the best potatos I've had in my entire life. The potatos still holded its shape but the texture is similar to mashed potatos, and the seasoning is just so on point. The eggs were great too, but I found the duck confit too sweet. My friend got the same thing but with smoked meat, and I liked it more than mine. 

Their french toast looked amazing too, so I'll be back for them ;)"}
{"text":"Belle ambiance autour d'un bon plat. Parcontre j'y suis retourné la semaine dernière et il y avais une longue file! Je crois que sa ne vaut pas la peine d'attendre cependant."}
{"text":"I have never had this great egg Benedict before! Egg Benedict sounds just eggs and some others so I usually don't enjoy it that much. But, the egg Benedict here is super great!!! Sauce on egg Benedict is creamy and not too salty and it fills me a lot! I will definitely come back again when I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"We got here at 1:30pm on a Friday. There was a line but it was not long; we only waited for about 15 minutes to get in. 
1. Interior: Quirky and interesting decor, very packed, hard to get out of our seats because the tiny tables were way too close to each other. The washrooms were actually a must-see. Too bad i did not bring my phone when i used the washroom. I wish i actually took pictures of it hahaha. Loved the whole retro theme.
2. Food: A plate of fruit screwer came first. We waited for 20 min to get our food (all waiters and waitresses were busy) but thankfully we weren't too hungry. I got À la bretonne egg benny and my mom ordered La biquette omelet. We were both big fans of the food as it was cooked perfectly. 2 things I really need to point out here: 
- THEIR POTATOES WERE AMAZING. you would not need any extra dipping sauce on the side as they are already well seasoned with many herbs that i cannot name. POTATOES POTATOES POTATOES 
- THEIR PORTIONS WERE HUGE. I could only finish half of my plate and my mom tried really hard to work through 3/4 of her omelet. we ended up having the leftover with some poutine for dinner.
3. Service: My sketchy french would only embarrass myself so the kind waiter served us in English. I forgot his name but he was really friendly and professional (and he wore a bow tie!!). It was a bit difficult to get noticed by the waiters and waitresses as there were just way too many people dining at the time but they tried their best to speed up everything so i had no complaints."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes in the freezing rain to get in and sat right next to the washrooms (which are super cool btw) and I am still giving this place 5 stars. The food was out of this world. The entire menu is super enticing - it was very difficult to make a choice. I had the L'indécis (which was perfect for someone as indecisive as me) - got a fruit skewer, scrambled eggs (cooked perfectly), potatoes, Montreal style bagel, and the crème bruleé French toast. Also had the mango-pineapple-lychee juice (which was actually a massive smoothie, with a tiny umbrella!), so refreshing. The only thing I can fault them for is giving me so much good food that I couldn't finish. I've really never been so impressed and happy that we decided to wait even with the line ups. No regrets! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"3 semaines à Montréal, 3 passages à l'Avenue ... autant vous dire que c'est un vrai coup de coeur !!! Du sucré, du salé, beaucoup de choix de pancakes, oeufs béné, omelettes, et des options végé vraiment top, bref il y en a pour tous les goûts et tous les appétits.
La déco est super originale et la brochette de fruits offerte en attendant son plat est un petit plus bien sympa :-)"}
{"text":"My aversion for queues has kept me away from this de rigueur Montreal brunch destination for over two years before I yielded and halfheartedly followed my friends to l'avenue on a quiet Saturday morning.

We were lucky enough to be there before the line had fully materialized, so we were seated surprisingly fast (I would say be there no later than 10:30 a.m. on weekends to avoid insane queues).

I now understand why people wait in -20-degree weather (although i wouldnt necessarily share the enthusiasm): the food is GOOD, portions are generous and the service, genuinely attentive.

One thing I remember LOVING was their watermelon-infused drinking water. 

The kids loved their french toast, and I loved my omelette (which was prepared with a lot of love, one can tell these things).

I would recommend L'Avenue for brunch provided the wait is not too long. And if it is, the wait will very likely be worth it :)"}
{"text":"This place needs to get organized. They make you wait in line (literally, even if it's pouring) outside and underestimate (say 20 minutes instead of 1 hour) the wait as well. I guess I'm spoiled because in Chicago, they take your cell number and give you a call when it's your turn, or give you a buzzer you can walk around with, or even have an app for their restaurant that tells you where you are in line AND when it's your turn. But here you can't move out of the line for the entire duration. Why? It's so silly! And food wasn't worth the wait for me. But then again I may be spoiled. :)"}
{"text":"The last time I was here I must have been hit in the face with a rock before stepping in because trying it again for the second time 5 years later.... I fell in love with brunch all over again. 

The banana nutella, coconut rum pancakes were fluffy and chocolatey! And their crème brulee French toast are thick slices of bread that have a beautiful crystal sugary crust on the outside. Absolutely one of the best French toasts I had up to date. IT remained fluffy, moist and the crust on the toast remained crunchy even after all the maple syrup I poured on it. 

Unfortunately L'avenue does not do savory dishes very well I have to say. Potatoes need to be crispier and have a crust on the outer skin, and in my opinion I feel like its always undercooked. The baked beans are too tomatoey, it doesn't have that sweet savory maple syrup bacon flavor I oh so love about it. The duck confit was lacking a lot of seasoning, and hollandaise could use a big pinch of salt. The sausage is super dry and the herbs and flavoring was a little weird for my liking. This is where L'avenue lost a lot of points

Overall, I will be returning to l'avenue and they will get their extra star with a little more love in their savoury dishes. But if sweet brunch is what you want for a reasonable price, l'avenue has officially won my heart"}
{"text":"Can you even say anything bad about this place?

A must have is the Grand Marnier french toast. I've tried my share of breakfast places but nothing compared to this dish. It also comes with this homemade sausage... yes it seems iffy but it's so tasty and spicy! Did I mention they serve the REAL maple syrup at no extra cost?! Service is quick because it is so busy (especially during weekends) but the staff is always there to lend a helping hand. But be warned, if you're heading there during peak hours be prepared to wait (totally worth it!)"}
{"text":"If the wait wasn't close to an hr for brunch, I would give this place 5 stars. By the time we were seated, my entire party was starving. There was also a lack of waitstaff. We waited a while to place our order and getting the check took sometime. However, our waiter was awesome. He patiently answered all our questions on the menu. It really sucks when you can barely read what's on the menu. The pancetta con tour eggs benedict was delish. Their hollandaise sauce was buttery rich. The omelettes are huge!! Needless to say, we suffered from major food coma afterwards.

I love how each order came with a skewer of fresh fruits (watermelon, orange, banana, honeydew, and cantaloupe)."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, but can be loud, so it must be expected. Food is pretty good. DON'T ask for spicy. I'm South Asian and ask for spicy at Indian restaurants, but what I had yesterday at l'Avenue was inedible. When I told the waitress, she said \"next time, don't order spicy.\" That pissed me off. I only finished 1/2 my plate, leaving most of the chicken behind. No \"sorrys\" and no discount. Basically, she blamed me. Water was refilled only once: right before the bill. Not going there again."}
{"text":"This place is fab!I went here tired of Faberge and wanting a change.The service was friendly enough and the Resto was cute.I ordered the chicken and waffles and was in heaven.The chicken was fried crispy and juicy with great flavor.The potatoes were sexy with a yummy sauce on the side along side juicy fruit.My only let down was the waffle.It was to sweet and dense for the plate.Will back soon if to only take a cool selfie in their Dope bathrooms."}
{"text":"La line up en arrivant, nous avons compris pourquoi en sortant de table ! 
Comme je vous disais une line up à peux prêt 20 min d'attente, pas grand chose . 
Service rapide et parfait, un bon choix de menu et des produits très bon je recommande vivement l'avenue sur notre dame ouest"}
{"text":"Un des brunchs les plus réputés du Plateau. Si vous avez la possibilité de venir tôt ou mieux, en pleine semaine, c'est mieux! Plus d'une heure de file pour manger, ce n'est pas vraiment ce que j'aime... Mais on teste quand même. (sous la forte pression de mes amis) Une fois à l'intérieur; de la deco colorée, de la musique de club et du bruit... Beaucoup de bruit, trop de bruit! 
J'ai pris un milk shake oréo et omg!! Excellent!!!! 
Et bien sûr des oeufs benedictines, mon péché mignon! Très bon et très copieux. (Impossible de finir mon assiette)
Les serveurs ont l'air débordé, le service s'en est ressenti. 
J'y retournerais, mais en semaine."}
{"text":"Such a longggg line up!! Almost an hour and half! And after that they put us in the middle of another groups' s table!!!! No privacy at all ! It was like if we were part of tgat group! Inside there is club music! Too noisy ! Food was delicious but it was not worth it!"}
{"text":"L'Avenue offers the real deal when it comes to breakfast in Montréal. Be aware -there is always a line up! We went on a Sunday morning at ~9am to beat the traffic. There was a very small line, and we only waited 10 minutes since we were only a group of 2. However, once we were done with our meal (~10:30am), we saw the line up outside and it was crazy. At least a two hour wait.

We first got the mango, pineapple & lychee smoothie ($6.89). It was big enough to share and was a great mix. 

Then, the eggs benedict with steak and mushrooms ($17.77); which was our favourite. The perfect mix of hollandaise sauce combined with the egg and steak. Definitely would recommend. 

We also got the Bon Ben Moi Je Prends Toute! (Ben, I'll have everything!) ($16.66) which was great as you can get a taste of everything.

Their breakfast potatoes that came with both meals was one of the highlights, and they also provide a skewer of fruit that comes with every meal. 

Definitely would recommend if you do visit Montréal, just make sure to get there early to beat the line!"}
{"text":"I went on a impromptu trip to Montreal with my sister. One of my girlfriends suggested we go here for Brunch and did warn us that it gets busy. We went and it actually wasn't busy, I think it was because we went on a Tuesday. OMG THIS PLACE IS THE BEES KNEES!!! the atmosphere is great and the staff is amazing. WARNING: the menu is not in English! I told the waitress what I wanted and she helped me out, also if you have dietary restrictions make sure you tell them and make it clear!!! I had Nutella pancakes with strawberries a, latte Bowl and eggs, I don't remember what my sister had but we would def go back there again. Writing this review right now is making wish i was back there. if your going to montreal I would def make sure to stop here!"}
{"text":"This was my first stop in Montreal and boy the food was amazing! The bathroom is also amazing LOL - glad I took my phone in with me. It was pretty much glow in the dark! Nice place to snap or take a bathroom selfie LOL

I had a salmon breakfast thing (forgot the name, attaching the picture) and it was delicious! They also serve watermelon water which was my first time having - also amazing. The wait was a while.. but that's only because we came around 1pm with 9 people. Def worth coming back if I stop by Montreal again!"}
{"text":"My family of 4 (wife and I and 2 teenage boys) visiting Montreal went here twice. Meals start with a skewer with 5 large pieces of fruit. Good start. Wife and kids had various egg meals, each with 4 or more accompaniments. One son had an egg concoction that was a cheese sauce over eggs over bbq beef (or was it pork, not sure), over potatoes and onions. Other son had 2 fried eggs, with bacon, sausage, bread, a pancake, a waffle, potatoes, more sausage (liver pate? yummy!!!) on top of cheese slices. Wife had their classic eggs benedict over braised pork. I went light with smoked salmon on a bagel with tomato salsa, homefries, caper berries. We went back a 2nd time and they had similar large meals. I had the oatmeal (with nuts/fruit). A lot of oatmeal (quart). The quantity was large for each meal. But we ate most if not all of it. Also did not need lunch later that day! One son enjoyed their milkshakes also. I sat by a nearby table where a young girl ordered the french toast with strawberries and it was just giant!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. So many original breakfast choices along with traditional items. Boyfriend got French toast with his poached eggs and said it was the best he's ever had. Service was great. Tables are a little close but not awful. Bathrooms are a trip haha! Definitely the weirdest bathrooms I have ever been in. My plate was great but there were A LOT of mushrooms and no sauce. I would have rather had the eggs over easy so they gooey yolk made a sauce, or just more of a sauce in general. Without it, my plate was a little dry. And too many mushrooms. But the flavors were great! My boyfriend loved his dish. Sweet and savory eggs Benedict. Also, GET THE NUTELLA COFFEE. Amazing. I recommend this place! Get there early and go during a weekday because I heard the lines can get really long. We didn't wait when we went (around 10/11 on a Monday), but there were people waiting when we left."}
{"text":"If you're in the area this is a great place for breakfast or brunch. It's very bright and colorful inside and the service was very friendly and fast. 

We went in and there was a line of course which was a good sign. 

The watermelon flavored water was a great touch, and the fruit skewer that comes with every meal is also a great bonus. 

I had the \"I'll take everything\" it had french toast a pancake, eggs, bacon, sausage, potato you name it! 
 
I was truly amazed I could walk after that meal. 

There really is something here for everyone. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"You know how people go on these awesome quests to discover all the best of certain things, mostly food dishes? For example, finding the best burger, the best pizza or the best taco joint, etc... Well, if you're making that list for Eggs Benedict, I think you may need a pit stop at Restaurant L'avenue in #Montreal.

We snuck in before a 30 minute wait and grabbed the last table by the door in this ever so hip, yet a bit small restaurant. With only French menus, I did decipher a few things, but our lovely waitress in a hurry let us know that they are known for their Eggs Benedict. 

We ordered up 2 sets of Bennies, his with Montreal smoked meat, swiss, mustard and of course hollandaise and mine with mushrooms, garlic aioli, bacon and hollandaise. They arrived about 15 minutes or so later. Cold. Boo, but silver lining is that they were still some of the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had.That hollandaise sauce was superb. So light and airy, with hints of lemon, but oh so rich and creamy with the perfect consistency. The flavor combo of the mushrooms, bacon and garlic confit was heavenly and oh so different in the best way possible from the rich and salty bites of smoked meat covered in dripping yolk. If it was a tad bit warmer, the dish would have been unquestionably one of the best things I've eaten in a while. 

If this wasn't enough, the dishes were accompanied with perfectly seasoned breakfast potatoes and a skewer of delicious fresh fruit. I was stuffed to the gills by the end of this proper brunch and although Eggs Benedict are quite gluttonous, I didn't feel too heavy or guilty.

So this leads me to why this review was not five stars. Our service lacked a bit, hence cold food. Not sure if this is a regular thing here, but they were severely understaffed. Granted it was a Monday at 11am and they were slammed, but with only 2 servers for the 50 people seated, I'd imagine that was why our food was cold. Another negative was that the coffee sucked, comparable to dirty diner coffee with the creamer packets on the side.

The other dishes being served look magnificent and in a foodie city like Montreal, when there's a savage line on a Monday late morning, you know whatever they're serving must be good. 

Bonus: One of the coolest, if not THE coolest bathrooms ever. Worth the trip even if you don't have to pee."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast and I must say it is damn good. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars because I'm not such a fan of the atmosphere for the morning. At 9am I don't want to hear techno music and I much prefer a relaxed atmosphere with a simple menu; not 18 different omelette!

Although if you want a fancy breakfast and enjoy the hectic atmosphere, this place is definitely better than Eggspectation, so give it a try!"}
{"text":"For Moslims: I recommend the following ranked benedicts:
1- arc-en-ciel: with smoked salmon
2- mr. Seguin: with spinach and goat cheese
3- breton: with vegetable like pizza"}
{"text":"Man, I was so excited to try L'Avenue being a fan of the brunch game in Montreal but somehow having never tried this place. I went to the new-ish location on Notre-Dame on a Wednesday for \"brunch for lunch\". 

Nice restaurant amid the horrible construction currently ongoing on Notre-Dame. I think maybe because of that fact, there were SO MANY flies and bugs banging and buzzing against the window right next to where we were seated, which made for a less than appetizing environment. 

If it wasn't for bugs, I would've probably given this place 4*. I loved my vegetarian omelette with baguette bread. Loved the fact that they served the fruits on a separate plate so thumbs up for that! The coffee was your average, refillable filter coffee that's much needed at that time of day.

I would only go back if they fix their bug problem!!"}
{"text":"At breakfast, expect await, but it is worth it! Fun, energetic, eclectic vibe. Great food and lots of options to select from on the menu. Fresh and tasty! Portions are large as well. Wait staff is friendly and attentive. Cocktails are yummy too. Especially, the Irish Coffee and the Blueberry Basil Mimosa."}
{"text":"This spot was so delicious. Only down side was that we had to make a line outside in the cold to get in. But after trying there food I realized the line was worth it. They have so many food options. The possibilities are endless. They had so many options that I didn't know what to get. I wanted to eat everything on the menu. I was there with family so we each got something different and we all tasted each other's plate. Omg amazing will be returning again when I go to Canada. I so recommend"}
{"text":"When breakfast is so good it makes you wanna cry! The eggs Benedict were absolutely delicious. Complimentary fruit skewer as appetizer, so nice. Service was great too. Also, the line outside isn't as bad if you go early."}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast/brunch spot!! 

Best part about living 2 mins away from the place is being able to go super early and never having to wait in the usually painfully long line!! 

The menu has a lot of options to suit everyone's tastes and preferences. Last time we went there for brunch, we ordered a few things for the table. We got the French Toast with Caramelised Bananas, coconut, rum sauce and Nutella. The Huevos Rancheros (Breakfast Burrito). And the Classic Benedict with Beef Strips. Everything was perfect as usual. Their french toast is a must try!! 
Also portions are huge so it's better to order and share!! Service is great."}
{"text":"Delicious.  The creative breakfasts are delicious and very generous.  But on weekends the line winds down the street."}
{"text":"This place is good, but not amazing! Je ne comprends pas vraiment les gens qui attendent en file, dehors! The service is excellent but the food ordinary! Les fruits ne sont pas murs, le café amer.. but the washrooms are the bawss! So fun!"}
{"text":"Un excellent brunch à Montréal! Prévoir son temps car une langue attente le week end!"}
{"text":"The steak eggs benedict was amazing!!! Went in June and i recommend to anyone and everyone who even mentions Montreal!!! Definitely one of the best breakfast places ever!"}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious! The waitstaff was awesome! They brought our party a round of free shots at the end. Hands down a must-visit!!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch! We visited based on the high ratings and reviews from previous Yelp users. A modern environment and a plethora of food options. I had the iced latte, and for my entree I had the scrambled eggs with sides of French toast, fruit, and potatoes. Happy we visited and if I lived in the area I would frequent the venue."}
{"text":"Non mais, vous avez vu la grosseur des assiettes?! En commandant le pain doré avec panko et sirop d'érable, jambon et oeuf bénédictine, je ne m'attendais pas à recevoir 2 tranches de pains épaisses comme 4 recouvertes de la plus décadente garniture de l'histoire des ufs bénédictines! Ma première pensée fut \"ha, j'aurais du demander que la moitié de l'assiette, je mangerai jamais tout ça..\", mais ce fut un de ces matins où j'avais un trou noir dans l'estomac et j'ai totalement englouti mon plat. Vous savez, quand c'est trop bon pour être gaspillé; Un équilibre parfait de sucré salé, de textures qui se complètent et de remords lorsqu'on voit le blanc de notre assiette. L'originalité du menu fait honneur aux plats reçus en service, ceux de mes convives étant tout aussi appétissants que le mien! Parfait pour les grands groupes et pour partager des assiettes, il faut arriver tôt par contre car le week-end une file se forme assez tôt! Et ça ne semble pas presser l'équipe en cuisine, le service s'avérant être plutôt lent. Mais si vous avez du temps, et un appétit monstre, ça vaut totalement la peine!"}
{"text":"The Steak Eggs Benedict here is AMAZING. Repeat: AMAZING. I'd definitely come back here just for that. 

Unfortunately the Duck Confit Eggs Benedict was far from amazing. Way too sweet. After several bites, I reached my limit. The only reason I had several bites of it was because it was my wife's order, and she felt the same way about it. 

The fruit that comes with every dish was very fresh and tasty. We were both very happy with our fruit plates. 

Very big portions too, although you wouldn't think so looking at some of the dishes. It might not look big, but your stomach will tell you otherwise, I promise.

Overall a pretty good place. I would try it again too. Given the popularity of this restaurant, I'm guessing the duck confit is an exception on their menu."}
{"text":"The duck confit eggs benny and the strawberry milkshake gave me serious itis. Overall, excellent place to grab brunch! They even give you free fruit kebabs as a starter! The bathroom here is also one of the most lit bathrooms I've been to date - it was quite an experience using their bathrooms lol. My only suggestion is to be more attentive on service. By the time we were finished, we ended up sitting for 15 minutes waiting for our server to give us the machine for our bills. We ended up just paying upfront even though most of the patrons have left by then (we left at almost 3). Overall, great place for brunch!"}
{"text":"So many different choices that they even have an option called the Indecisive which is a combination of different breakfast meats, fruit, bread, and eggs. There are also a bunch of different types of eggs benedicts which I feel is rare to see in one menu so if you are a fan of eggs benedict definitely check this place out. It has a modern diner feel. Very friendly staff and large portions."}
{"text":"In the heart of Plateau, l'Avenue is very easy to spot. That hole in the wall that always seems to have a massive lineup? Yup, you've found it. The place is quite cramped for their enormous popularity but you will definitely enjoy your time there. Your menu looks like a dating game show; interesting! The food is quite tasty. Being used to your traditional breakfast places that give you the choice of brown or white bread, I was shocked when they asked if I'd like brown, white, baguette or bagel (bagel, please!). My favorite part of my dish was the crème brûlée French toast - so crispy and sweet. I will surely be back!"}
{"text":"On our trip to Montreal we searched for highest rated brunch place on Yelp.
after waiting for 1 and half hour in line we finally got in.
The menu was in French and it is quite difficult for people who understand only English.
The bought us fresh fruits that was good.
But the food wasn't Great but the presentation was good.
we ordered some chicken benedict eggs and salmon but we weren't at all satisfied with it.
But they have awesome restroom.
neon lights zombies all over the wall something new to see."}
{"text":"So yummy!! Very friendly service (even offered to fill up our water bottle) and the best juice/smoothie I've ever had (the dragon fruit one). We ate the pancakes with strawberries, banana and dulce de leche cream, and the eggs Benedict with a variety of veges like asparagus and mushrooms. Just be warned the serving sizes are enormous, but it was just what I needed after 2 long days of flying"}
{"text":"Amazing eggs benedicts and brunch! Their portions are HUGE and their potatoes are heavenly  seasoned (a little seasoning goes a long way) and  I have yet to try a benedict that I didn't like. If you re fan of sweet salty food like me, I heavily suggest the sweet and salty with maple syrup french toast benedict! Their mushroom and lard benedict is amazing as well as their crab cake one! 

I suggest asking for the hollandaise on the side seeing that the benedicts are quite heavy and it can get hard to eat after a while. 

PROS: Huge portions, great potatoes, great benedicts, cute atmosphere
CONS: Huge waiting times (expect 2hr wait during prime time)"}
{"text":"Plats très très copieux pour des européens mais de relativement bonne qualité. Les pancakes sont bons, les fruits frais. Très bon pain doré (pain perdu). L'eau à la pastèque est très appréciable. 
Très bon service. 
Conseils : allez voir les toilettes ; arrivez tôt pour éviter une queue d'une heure."}
{"text":"I was always a fan of this place despite not being able to eat gluten.  Breakfast is usually one of the easiest meals of the day for my allergy.  I would usually order a scrambled egg dish with plenty of mushrooms and tell the staff to skip the toast.

However, they're doing awesome things with their eggs benedict now.  Their benny sauce is gluten free and they offer gluten free toast on their menu. Celiacs and gluten intolerant folks can rejoice.

This place is incredibly tasty and the price point is great considering they bring you a mountain of food with good service (despite their suspiciously long table queue).

Come enjoy!"}
{"text":"Resto à brunch bien ordinaire, je n'ai absolument AUCUNE idée pourquoi il y a une espèce de culte autour de cette adresse. Franchement, c'est loin de valoir la peine de faire l'aussi longue file pour rentrer. Il existe des dizaines d'autres restos à déjeuner vraiment plus intéressants dans les environs!"}
{"text":"We lucked out by walking in for brunch with no line. It was a weekday and happened to get there before a rush. Otherwise, groups were waiting b/w 15-25 minutes (depending on size). The food is pretty damn good as the reviews state. There was NO disappointment there. The place is decorated with cool wall art and motorbikes that hang right above your head (your fine if you're not sitting at one of those tables hehe). Bathrooms are interesting. 

Overall, I felt really cramped and was a party of 6 instead of 2. Even in NYC they give you 3-5 more inches bw tables than they do at Restaurant l'avenue. The waiter kept going to the wrong table with our water refill, ketchup & fork (I needed a new one). The table next to us got their coffee warmed up at least once and I didn't get one. Poo. 

I would recommend someone to go for the great food without a doubt. But, as a tourist, it is off my list now & prob wouldn't go back. Unless there was no line. And the tables were a little roomier. And the waiters remembered their customer's orders/requests a tiny bit better. Okay then."}
{"text":"Boo Boo and I came here for breakfast on a Friday. We were lucky to get a table without having to wait. There was a huge line as after we finished. 

I got a cappuccino and Boo Boo got a bowl of latte to start. Then we I order the indecisive with bacon, sausage, carrot cake, bagel and eggs over easy with potatoes. Boo Boo got the egg Benedict with mushroom, onions I don't know the name..... I guess every entree comes with a fruit skewer to wet your appetite. 

Overall, the food was tasty and portion was huge. However, it's like $20 for breakfast per person. Kinda on high end.

The bathroom is cool yet intimating.

Credit card accepted.  A couple blocks for the mont royal station (orange line subway)."}
{"text":"This was by far my favorite brunch place in Montreal.  If you're willing to wait for about an hour in line, you'll be glad you did once you start your meal (I usually grab a coffee next door at Peete's while waiting and there is also lots of people watching).  Most brunch plates come with buttery breakfast potatoes in their own little oven-bake bowl, and a big skewer of fresh fruit.  The menu is all French, so better if you speak it.  Otherwise, take a chance - you'll probably be happy with whatever you get.  Just bring your appetite, the plates are huge!
Ambiance is fun and colorful; patrons in general are young, urban hipsters that will be crunched in to the tables next to you.  Service was not the best any of the times I went there but they get the job done. Nice enough but not very attentive.  Don't go if you're in a hurry...but  it's Sunday morning, anyway - what's the rush?!"}
{"text":"L'avenue is delicious, but nearly impossible to get into without a looong wait during any touristy times. If you want to go on a weekend or (at any time in the summer), it's best to get there as soon as they open. The food is good, but nowhere is worth a 2 hour wait!"}
{"text":"This place was so good! You have to go early or you'll  be waiting in line but it is worth it. The caramelized apple bacon and cheddar pancakes are to die for"}
{"text":"Mannequin with a boner....(you'll know when you get there)

The line 10 deep out the door was the first sign that it was something worth waiting for.  It was cool to see the fruit chef making all the fruit skewers while you wait outside.

While we were waiting, we salivated over the chocolate pancakes that someone was eating.  Everything looked so good!  It made the 30 min. wait somewhat bearable.

The ham and egg crepes were divine and the smoked salmon benedict was scrumptious!  Our kids shared a Dagwood Bumstead style breakfast sandwich which was enough for two adults to share.

The highlight for me was the uber-fresh fruit smoothie. I ordered the Banana-Papaya-Mango smoothie and it was probably the best fruit smoothie i've ever tasted.  It tasted so smooth and natural and not too sweet.

Now back to the mannequin... we sat near the door where the mannequin is displayed and the kids ended up entertaining the folks in line with their giggling and the ultimate finger to the boner maneuver... i think the video will be on YouTube any day now...

Overall, great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday afternoon for brunch for 4. there was a long line but it moved quicker than expected. service was good and staff was friendly! They have an extensive menu, it took us some time to decide what we wanted. 3 of us got the steak & eggs benedict - it was amaazzinggggg and filling, the steak was delicious!! And 1 of us got the regular eggs benedict which also tasted good! They also gave us complimentary fruits on a kebab. We also got 2 exotic drinks: ORANGE, FRAMBOISES ET BLEUETS and MANGUE, ANANAS ET LITCHI - both were sweet and tasty. this staff was very attentive, came back to ask if we liked the food but we were still taking pictures of the food, haha! The restroom is also cool..I won't say, you should go inside and experience it yourself! I will def come back here for brunch if ever visiting Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the top places to have brunch. They serve a beautiful fruit brochette with every meal and the eggs they use are from free range chicks. Their French toast is amazing  as well as their coconut milk and maple syrup coffee! Their restaurants are super cute and the staff is always pleasant!"}
{"text":"There will never be a better place for brunch. Was only in Montreal for 4 days, came here twice for brunch, was very willing to wake up early and get here before the morning rush.

Bobby does Dallas: Egg skillet with potatoes sausage and everything else savoury 
Carrot cake pancakes: semi forced into ordering this, my friend is \"Healthy\", and \"Vegan\"  
basically, she saw the words carrots and freaked out. Slightly dry, was ok
Classic eggs benny: had like a smokey maple pulled ham on top of an eng.muffin, it was the Sweet and savoury combination was so good, regular ham cannot compare
Salted pretzel french toast: so fluffy, very fluffy, sugary goodness, zero regrets on this one

Pro-tip: take your phone into the bathroom for some selfies, I have never seen a more interesting bathroom (glow in the dark? really?)"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE BRUNCH SPOT! We went on a Saturday morning and waited for 20 minutes - definitely anticipate some waiting as this place gets very busy. The restaurant accommodates to gluten free and vegan options - I had the poached eggs on a portobello mushrooms. So flavorful! Great service and unique decor as well. Good spot for couples and big groups as well."}
{"text":"This gem has all the brunch spot essentials checked off - fresh food with big portions,  attention to the right detail, busy and bustling and Wu-Tang Clan on the soundtrack.

First, they had me at almond milk. Crucial (the latte was delicious, by the way - I ordered the bowl-sized on). My coffee came with a small chocolate on the side, the table water was watermelon-infused and the maple syrup on all tables was the real, authentic good stuff. 

On to the menu, which offers limitless options. It really is hard to choose, but the good news is, you can't go wrong. We had eggs over easy (cooked perfectly) with a side of Montreal smoked meat (when in Rome...), crispy breakfast potatoes and then, the pièce de résistance, the carrot cake pancakes (there were several other contenders including the salty pretzel pancakes).

We also had the \"gym dude\" omelette, which is very much my kind of brunch food. Egg whites with chicken and mushrooms, with a side of huge delicious salad. Perfect for the health conscious, brunch-loving, weekend warrior who wants to eat more than steel cut oats and greek yogurt, which is also in the menu in case that happens to be your jam.

Service was fantastic. The wait staff checked on us several times, which is rare for a place this busy, and we were able to customize our order to our liking. All while Jay Z played in the background."}
{"text":"You can't go to Montreal and not try this breakfast. The Baked Beans and Sausage with herbs were the best I have had thus far. Also, great service. Thank y'all for making my visit to Montreal a memorable one!"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing brunch I've had in my 31 years of life so far.  I got the mushrooms eggs benny and swapped my half with the duck confit eggs benny, and the banana/pineapple smoothie.  The benny was delicious and perfection from the bun to the sauce, and the the roasted potatoes it came with. As other reviewers have pointed out, you start with a skewer of fresh fruits, which is a nice touch. 

The portions are huge, so come hungry.  

Also check out the washrooms.  You'll see why."}
{"text":"The decoration is amazing. Service is fast! Although always there is a waiting line but it worth it.
There have English and French menu. 
I only find the music is a bit heavy for brunch! But it's highly recommended"}
{"text":"Delicious and fun brunch joint. I waited till Monday on our trip to try out this place since the weekend lines were so long. We got seated immediately and it's a pretty cramped space. The restaurant was packed for a Monday morning. 
I started off with their adorable tropical smoothies. I got the lychee, mango, pineapple and it was huge and topped off with a cocktail umbrella. Super yummy and fresh! 
This place is known for their eggs benny and I can tell why. I'm not a fan of runny eggs but my boyfriend cut me a part a piece of the caramelized pork, egg, and hollandaise sauce and I heard angels sing when I took a bite. 
I opted to get the \"indecisive\" brunch with salted pretzel dulce de leche pancakes, scrambled eggs, wheat toast, bacon, sausage, and potatoes. Everything was pretty good but the eggs Benny really took the cake. 
I can tell people come here for the ambience as well. The place is super funky with their watermelon water. Their bathroom is also the coolest. I'm glad I got to eat here before heading back to the US."}
{"text":"Please is absolutely delicious. From their eggs, to French toast, to eggs Benedict, to omelets, to coffee and smoothies. I live for their banana and strawberry smoothies, and cafe latte served in a bowl. My fav eggs Benedict are the Steak and eggs. Place is busy and lines are long, but it's worth it. They definitely don't rush you once you're seated and the waiters are a little rough..,but thats Montreal. Service is definitely better in other cities in general, so get over it, it's not just this restaurant. Francophones in Montreal are known to downtalk english speakers....which is unfortunate. How we get tourists at all I'll never know"}
{"text":"5 out of 5 brunch for sure.  Well worth the wait. The menu is extensive and the whole vibe of the restaurant from the interior to the music to the black light bathroom is so unique and so Montreal.

Each meal begins with a complimentary fruit skewer that is better than most fruit salads.  Additionally, we ordered a pitcher of sangria to split, which included even more freshly prepared fruit in the glass.  For meals we tried the salmon Benedict, carrot cake pancakes, and steak with ham and sausage between the 3 of us.  To begin, the Benedict Hollandaise sauce and the carrot cake glaze were some of the richest sauces I've ever tasted.  Insanely delicious but a tough hang with the amount of spread and food involved.  Outside that, the breakfast potatoes were #1 on my favorite potatoes of all time.  Great seasoning and large chunks were a perfect side.  The eggs in both dishes were cooked as expected and popped perfectly.  To top off our already good meal, they offered gluten free options at no additional cost.  Throw in some fantastic baguette with the egg dish and this meal was absolutely incredible.

Service is a little slow which leads to the lines but they let you sit and gab and drink without any hurry so you don't feel like you're forced out of the restaurant upon finishing your meal.  Just get in line and wait an hour...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend and I waited 30 minutes for a table outside in the cold and I would do it again and again and again. This place has a great vibe, great food, and great service. The menu is large and we had an issue picking what we wanted to get! I could have ordered everything on the menu. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because we were kind of stuffed in a corner with very little room. It was a little uncomfortable but the food really made up for it. I had the creme brulee french toast and my friend ordered the carrot cake pancake. We both said it was one of the best breakfasts we've ever had!"}
{"text":"Consistency at it's best. This is a must try before you die. Just prepare to wait in line. But wait, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Oh wow, this is what breakfast should be.

I split the beautiful truffle and the caramelized banana french toast (with coconut-rum sauce) and both were wonderful. Huge portions, rich without being overpowering, and the fruit skewer appetizer was a nice touch. The breakfast potatoes were also excellent!

Make sure you get there early, though-- the line was out the door by 9:30am even on a rainy Monday."}
{"text":"First and foremost can I say wow!! Came here for brunch on Saturday around 3 ish and  was expecting a huge line but there was only one couple in front us! Woo hoo! We really lucked out! One of the waiters was about to seat us in a tiny table in front but decided to move us to a booth in the back for my friend and I! Can you say VIP treatment? It only got better from there! 

Our server was so attentive offering up suggestions for a good brunch since the menu was in French. I ended up with Eggs Benedict with Salmon, a fruit kebab, and some freshly squeezed orange juice. Firstly, I can proudly state that this was the best brunch I have ever had and I consider myself a professional bruncher! Not only was the meal plentiful but the quality of the ingredients was superb. My friend had an omelette with goat cheese and it was amazing, I have never tasted an omelette like that in my life. 

Price is about 15 bucks for a meal but that's a steal for the amount of food and the amazing quality you get. Plus the service is fabulous, something that a lot of restaurants seem to forget about. Our server always came back to ask us about our meal and kept the coffee flowing.

After all this was done I have to say the hidden or not so hidden gem has got to be the washroom! Yes the washroom! It's like stepping into another dimension with black lights and graffiti. That has got to be the most unexpected/creative washroom I've ever been in. So fun and entertaining don't forget to snap some pics while in there!"}
{"text":"Whenever I read about a restaurant's typical 40 minute wait, it always manages to rain when I decide to go....

We came here for brunch and it was well worth the wait.  The place is divided in two: the front has 2 person tables with awesome graffiti on the wall and the back has booths and a view of a bright courtyard.  I don't typically suggest taking a camera into the bathroom, but there is cool graffiti art work on the walls.  The decor is cool with a hanging motorcycle and metallic female figure.  

Depending on what you order, they give you complimentary fruit on a skewer (bananas, melons, cantaloupe, pineapple, orange or blood orange) - you can see them prepping it while you wait outside.  The menus resemble album covers and are in french.  Luckily, I already knew what I wanted: Black Angus Eggs Benedict.  The eggs were perfectly poached and the steak was tasty (not chewy).  I found the potatoes to be too salty to eat (the other seasoning on it was very good).  

For good food, explore the \"local\" restaurants like this one which is off of St Denis (away from the tourist traps in Old Montreal and St Catherine's)."}
{"text":"Wow. This place impresses on every level and we are hard to please New Yorkers (i.e. five stars is rare). A hipster diner with great service and a fun, artsy vibe. Yes, the bathrooms are epic with black lighting, day glo paint, and creative, tattoo style art. Worth a visit. For food, we ate on a Monday morning at 10:30am and the place was busy with a short wait. We started with watermelon infused flat water and a massive and otherworldly good nutella and raspberry milkshake. My blueberry and basil mimosa, new for me, was a pleasant surprise. All breakfast appears to start with a skewer of fruit - pineapple, melon, canteloupe, grapefruit, and watermelon - which was yummy and by far the healthiest thing we had as we embarked on a large breakfast journey.

For entrees, the Sugar Shack is a massive, lumberjack portioned platter with perfectly made pancakes, pork bbq, paté, baked beans, fried eggs, and freshly made bread for the toast, an incredibly well prepared feast. Every component was excellent. I ordered the huevos rancheros, which was also terrific and a very large portion: too much for me to finish and with a nice green sauce and pico de gallo on top. The breakfast potatoes were fantastic, too.

We were full for many hours and walked from Mile End to the old city, the port, and the Golden Mile, 22,795 (8.6 miles) steps to be exact, to get remotely close to working off the meal. This is a must visit while in MTL."}
{"text":"What a delightful discovery!

In my opinion, this is a good place to get some specialties.
We had ordered with friends a menu each, including chicken and spicy sauce, followed by fries, to take away. Service is fast and efficient, we had our order quickly, for a total of $ 15 a piece it seems to me very reasonable (with drink and with fries) right on the spot or take away so.
Good fries: crispy and fresh. but it is the chicken plate, with its sauce, what made me to write a review, also convenient to bring it home"}
{"text":"We were waiting for an 1hr and the food is not good as expected. Would never recommend here h to my friends"}
{"text":"When you eat at L'avenue you feel like you're tapping into a local Montreal secret.  Unassuming from the outside, the inside is decorated tastefully in an urban-graffiti motif complimented with a random scantly clad mannequin greeting you at the doorway and a motorcycle with helmet (safety first) suspended on the wall.  

Service is a bit slow since it was packed on a Monday at 10:30 AM and they only had 3 waitresses but it was worth the wait. I opted for  the eggs benedict with hot italian sausage served with a side of seasoned potatoes and a fruit skewer.  A word of warning - everything on the menu is in French but the staff is helpful and as long as you have a basic understanding of the latin roots \"sausage\" \"salmon\" \"Omega 3 oeuf\" you should be fine.  The mixture of tastes was euphoric - I haven't had eggs benedict like this in awhile.  The portions are well sized even for my American appetite.  The only cons I can think of are the cramped quarters (probably not the best place for parties over 4)."}
{"text":"After a long night shift, I was very hungry and just wanted to devour the best food I could find. Looking for a brunch place, I ended up choosing L'Avenue. There was a small waiting line around 10am on a Wednesday morning. We were 2 and waited for about 10-15 mins before being seated.

Inside, the tables are very close to each other so you might bump into the person next to you. As I was very hungry, I ordered the \"Take-It-All\", which consisted of 2 eggs, 1 sausage, 2 pieces of bacon, pulled pork, beans, potatoes, crouton, a french toast and a pancake for about 18$ before taxes. Needless to say, the portions were huge and finishing the whole plate was a big task. As for the flavor itself, I found the mix between the different parts of the plate mixing very well together with a mix of salty and sweet. The best part in my opinion was the french toast. 

Would recommend if you need your brunch fix, but beware, come early if you don't want to be stuck in line waiting!"}
{"text":"3.5 is my real rating.
This place offers a huge selection of breakfast/brunch, and the size of them is insane. On other words, sharing a plate among 2 people is a good option for those who want to avoid wasting food. Food is good but not extraordinary either.
The place in itself is big and rather noisy. There is almost always a lineup; expect to wait a good half hour or more over the weekends. 
Service is good but slow, so keep in mind that patience is key. 
End word: A decent option in Montreal."}
{"text":"1st meal in Montreal while waiting to access our Airbnb. The staff is very nice, friendly and accommodated our luggage. The decor is funky and awesome. We each had a Benedict, my hubby got the traditional (although it's more of a shredded pork situation) and I had the asparagus mushroom with gluten free bread (I don't have a gluten sensitivity I just like to get the option sometimes). Both were generous portions and delicious, and the potatoes are spectacular. We will be coming back here before we leave next week for sure."}
{"text":"Huge portions for breakfast! One of the most filling breakfast I've had in a while! The crab cakes Benedict was filled with crab meat that made it worth it. The bathroom is an experience like everyone said"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. The best brunch in town. Every bite has so much taste and you can experience all the flavours blend into something great. The coffee and potatoes are good as well! Must try and worth the wait if there is a line outside."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! From the steak eggs Benedict to the 4 year cheddar cheese in Mme.Perron's Benedict! Simply delicious! Worth the wait even if there is a line. The water has a taste of watermelon because they put real watermelon inside their water distributor. The coffee and has potatoes here is great, too! Very French, authentic breakfast."}
{"text":"This place made our one day stay in Montreal memorable!
We were looking for this place on the street and saw this huuge line, got to know its of l'avenue. We waited for about an hour in that line to get in hoping it better be worth it.

The ambiance is what you would want from any breakfast place, a bright place with cheerful faces :)

The service was pretty quick and the food was amazing!
The duck egg Benedict was the best eggs Benedict I have ever had, a must try for eggs Benedict lovers!

10/10 would waste one hour of my life again to get this experience!"}
{"text":"I go to the l'avenue on mont royal so I decided to try out the new one that opened in Saint henri. The standard is great and pretty much the same but the wait times is long and there is something just a little bit missing in the flavours. However all around delicious still!"}
{"text":"My partner and I gave L'Avenue a miss on Sunday because the weather was crap and the line was insane. Came back Monday and there was no wait-- we were shown back to a cozy corner booth and treated ourselves to a leisurely and scrumptious brunch. B got a beer and the Beautiful Truffle, I got a blueberry mimosa and the breakfast poutine, and we split the pear/dark chocolate pancakes. We were stuffed to the gills and so pleased with ourselves. The menu is kitsch and fun, and the entire restaurant lives up to that aesthetic. We loved every minute and L'Avenue will be top of our list to visit next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Managed to sneak in when they opened the doors at 8am, and I was absolutely happy with the food, and service. I can understand the lineups that seem to plague the place. It's a great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"BEST EGGS BENEDICT EVER.

The line outside the door at around 10:30 am was pretty long; I'd say we waited maybe 20-30 minutes? The longer I waited, the higher my standards were for this place, to be honest! 

The ambiance is pretty interesting--a floating motorcycle above one table, a colorful mannequin at the window, and the whole place seemed to rely mostly on sunlight from the windows. 

My boyfriend has been here before and he recommended that I get the steak and mushroom benedict. I did, and we also got complimentary assorted fruits on a skewer. The water tasted strange, and we assumed it was maybe infused with fruit before hand or something, but it wasn't bad. When my eggs benedict came out, it smelled AMAZING. At both ends of the plate were sliced English muffins, with the eggs benedict on top and the tender steak and mushrooms topped everything else (it also had its own type of gravy, which mixed in with the hollandaise sauce). In the middle of the plate was a small cup of roasted potatoes. First bite I took, I tried tasting the egg, muffin, a piece of steak and a piece of mushroom simultaneously and I couldn't keep up a conversation with our friends--THE FOOD WAS JUST TOO GOOD and I wanted to endure every chew. The hollandaise sauce was so unique to me because it didn't taste so bland, and having it be mixed with the tangy gravy sauce that accompanied the steak made the whole forkful even better. 

The wait was worth it. The service is great. The food is better. I am at a loss for words at how outstanding my meal was. A must-visit for ALL tourists!"}
{"text":"Seriously great brunch!! I got the sweet-savory-crunchy (probably my favorite brunch ever ordered) & my hubs got huevos rancheros. We got the carrot pancake for our 2 year old (tastes like carrot cake!). I also had the coconut maple coffee (amazing but took a long time to come out so if you just really need caffeine go with regular coffee). Everything was sooooo good. Excellent service too. Worth the long wait to get in. Do it."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for brunch. Food was great but not sure if would be down for another hour wait
 
When you come to L'Avenue du Plateau, every order comes with a fruit skewer, watermelon infused water and amazing service.

Disclaimer: the menu is only in French and pretty much ordered using yelp suggestions.

Decided on the original eggs benedict which comes with pulled pork. Seemed like at least half of the restaurant orders this and it did not disappoint. Eggs were perfectly runny and the english muffin was warm and fluffy and the pulled pork succulent covered by this amazing sauce.

Next up is Bobby does Dallas. This comes with eggs with cheese, sautéed onions, really well seasoned garlic potatoes and few pieces of steak. This comes with bread and is perfect for those looking for a hearty and filling meal.

Also tried the french toast with bananas, nutella, rum sauce and coconut shreds.
Almost didn't get this because how good can French toast get? We already had 2 entrees for 2 people but we thought we waited an hour for this so might as well get some extra food for the drive back to Toronto. IT WAS SO GOOD. I unquestionably have a sweet tooth so while some people might think the French toast is too sweet, it was perfect to me. The toast was fluffy and drenched in deliciously sweet syrup. My favorite part was the coconut shreds.The portions here are huge and 3 was definitely aggressive. I think even with only 2 things we would've had leftovers.

PS: Don't leave before checking out the bathroom. Promise you've never seen washrooms like it before."}
{"text":"The food is amazing especially the eggs benedict in that nice consistency of a hollandaise sauce.The decor is a novelty with glow in the dark bathrooms and a bike hanging from the ceiling.The lunch is decent too,portions are big.You might have to wait on sundays and saturdays"}
{"text":"L'Avenue is probably the most hyped about brunch place in the city and no trip/stay in MTL is complete without it. Get ready to line up if you don't plan on showing up early on a weekend which is when most people go out for brunch. Their Eggs Benedict is truly heavenly and my friend loves their milkshakes. Staff is nice and the bathroom is too cool. This is how you run a business and keep 'em coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Had the Salmon benedicts, it was hands down amazing! Though my friends had the duck benedicts which was pretty good. If you're looking for a change from the salmon dish, would suggest the duck benedicts. I also had the Oreo milkshake, and I absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"The mango lychee juice was awesome! Recommend sharing, it's huge! The portion sizes are absolutely crazy too- I ordered the Indecisive and I couldn't finish myself. The Mac n cheese pancakes with eggs were great, and fruit was awesome. Staff was awesome, and the bathroom was super cool!! You have to take a trip there."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here, L'Avenue has never failed to make me feel warm and satisfied on the inside. Although Montréal is a brunch mecca of sorts, what separates L'Avenue from other brunch places that emphasize quantity and quality is the sheer variety of menu offerings that they have. How they manage to make everything stay fresh and taste good with that many ingredients on hand is beyond me, but it works! I almost always opt for their Eggs Benedict dishes, and this time I ordered the Monsieur Séguin II - an Eggs Benedict with goat cheese, spinach, and sautéed mushrooms. In my opinion, I think Eggs Benedict is fascinating because it never looks like much food at first glance, but that's because the ingredients are all piled on top and really makes your palate become exposed to a variety of flavors in one bite. The gooey egg yolk mixed with the creamy chevre and the meaty mushrooms was a perfect combination, and the spinach carried a sense of lightness that balanced out the umami of the other components. The breakfast potatoes, which weren't overlooked by any means, was the icing on the cake. By the time I finished, I was so stuffed that I forgot about my neglected blueberry and basil mimosa, which was tasty in its own right. L'Avenue puts a lot of champagne in their mimosas, and for me, the more booze, the better! Thankfully, it didn't overpower the sweetness of the blueberry and the freshness of the basil.

Of course, no visit to this place is complete without a stop in their bathrooms. Although I didn't go this time, I'm guilty of taking mirror selfies surrounded by the cool and quirky mismatched neon colors. It's a rite of passage in Montréal, no?"}
{"text":"Food is whatever but if you need to take a shit this is the place! (The bathroom is really dope!) lol"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere. There was ecen a live band! We loved this place and would definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"The benedicts get all the attention but the french toast maybe the best you will ever eat. It has ruined french toast for me because I know I will never find another place that will come close. I got the duck eggs benedict and it was incredible but after stealing a bite of my friend's french toast it was all that I could think about for the rest of the day

The line here for brunch will take awhile but that is to be expected for such good food. The decor is great especially the bathroom graffiti. The complementary fruit skewers and fruit infused water were also very appreciated. Highly recommend this place and is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch in North America. I will literally fly to Montreal from nyc just to have their food. I will literally wake up hungover at 7am on a Saturday morning so I can avoid the long lines that start around 9am. And I will ignore the fact that I have to google translate half the menu each time I go because it's in French. The food makes it all worth it.

I mean, I don't even like eggs benedict! But I do here. Fruit for breakfast? Way too cool for me. But sure, I'll have a fruit kebab at L'Avenue. Coffees? Great. Mimosas? Yes! All different kinds of fruit drink combinations? Check. Omelettes? Large and delish. Their side roasted potatoes are insane. Among my favorite foods in the world. Am I gushing? Yeah I am and you will be too when you try them. I can't say enough good things about this place. Who do I speak to about opening up one of these joints in NY?"}
{"text":"Great food, good price. You must check out the bathroom! It's something."}
{"text":"Ça m'a pris du temps avant de me décider d'y aller. Il est préférable de se rendre avant 10h le matin si on ne veut pas faire l'interminable line up dehors. J'y vais seulement pour le merveilleux steak and egg. La brochette de fruits avant repas aide à boucher un petit trou avant le déjeuner."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great portion. You must order their mango, pineapple and lychee drink, it was so good! Each serving comes with  skewer of fruits. Their Benedict came with seasoned potatoes and a skewer of fruits. The french toasts were huge but it was okay, cannot say it was the best french toast I've ever had. Overall, the food was good!"}
{"text":"Ordered the eggs Benedict with chicken and French toast. The servings are huge!!!! The food was great, service is fantastic and even though we were in a line to get in, the wait was not too long. Will definitely come back if we visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"Five for the food, and two stars for the service...which evens out to about four stars since food is weighed more importantly. We waited for our food for over an hour and a half. i don't know if they had forgotten to put it in...or what, but everyone around us who had gotten there at the same time, got their food, paid, left, got home, had sex, showered, took a nap....meanwhile, back at l'avenue, we're still waiting for our food. We had two full pitchers of sangria while waiting and got proper trashed and roudy. As an apology for the obscene wait, we were given a shot of something (jameson?)...which i suppose was nice. The food finally came and it was fantastic. Dare i say it was worth the wait? Anyways, i thought that they would give us a discount. but they didn't. I did make a trip to the bathrooms, though, and they're pretty awesome. They have blacklights and white grafitti, stenciling all over the walls. Awesome. Go for the food, and hope that the bad service was a fluke."}
{"text":"OMG Fresh squeezed OJ in their pitchers of mimosas! What a way to start the day! My liver was hoping for OJ, and it was not unhappy. Little did it know that there was also champagne in my OJ. 

Ended up here after walking out of another restaurant where the service was horrible, and the table was dirty. I guess, when in doubt, use Yelp. This well Yelped establishment certainly lived up to the hype. 

My friends and I all ordered benedicts. I had the salmon one. While the flavor of it all was great, I would have liked a bit more smoked salmon on my plate. Everyone else at the table thought their benedicts were great. The thing that actually impressed me about the plate, was the fresh fruit salad that came with it. This is not your mama's canned fruit salad, or some crappy little mint leaf garnish. Im talking full on bowl of probably 8 different fruits in a big bowl type salad. It was great. 

To go with the good food, was not only a friendly server, but a manger who went out of his way to offer us sight seeing ideas when he was busy running a packed restaurant. This place was busy the entire time we were there. Staff was very friendly and food was delicious. Be sure to hit it up in you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Service sucks ,great food, wish manue in English, will come back just coz  of the food , wait time about 45 min ."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, they serve good breakfast and the service is decent. But it is not worth the hype. This place is mainly popular with tourists who go because of its status (here on yelp) and line up in front of the door (\"this place must be amazing\")... its not that special.

the ambiance is too much like an exclusive club in my opinion. The food is good but definitely not better than some more local gems, the price is much higher than other more traditional places. i would suggest you to skip the line and try another place."}
{"text":"My faaaaaaaaavorite brunch place. The are so many choices you can't even decide. We always have to wait in line but it goes by super fast. The eggbenedicts and the omelettes are delicious, the portions are huge though, can never finish. The smoothies are good too. This is my all time favorite brunch spot!!"}
{"text":"Nice place, and nice waiters! Food is ok but not amazing. The bathroom lights are the BEST for photo-taking."}
{"text":"I love the uniqueness of this gem! My fiancé and I were visiting family in Montreal and they brought us here for breakfast! The interior is nothing like I've ever seen before especially the bathroom- so cool! To start, I loved the watermelon infused water! Yum! The fruit brochettes were so fresh and the food was excellent with huge portions! My Fiancé ordered the coconut milk coffee which will be unforgettably delicious. I ordered a Nutella coffee which to my opinion left a little to be desired but that didn't take away from the overall experience! We waited about 15 minutes for a table but it was definitely worth it! If you're in the area don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Not quite sure of the high rating of this joint but its pretty typical brunch food by NY standards. Nothing amazing, nothing bad. Bathroom blacklight was the most interesting thing about this place."}
{"text":"They have a big selection in the breakfast menu.
I chose l'indécis; 2 eggs with a sausage, bacon, fruits and a delicious dulce de lecce pancake.
They have big portions, and a nice decoration. Service is good, the waiter was nice."}
{"text":"Amazing! Had to wait in line for about 15 mins but totally worth it! Probably will be the most memorable part of my trip to Montréal. Nice servers that can speak both English and French--but make sure you know how to read the menu in French!"}
{"text":"First time here. I have never been to their other location in Plateau Mont-Royal.

We wait about 45 minutes to get in but we were lucky to cut the line since we were only 2 and everyone in front of us were larger groups. If you want to try this restaurant (which you should!), I suggest you go only with one friend. 

We had the duck confit Benedicts and the \"I'll take it all\" plate. The plates are enormous, the waitress later told us there is an option to share a plate.
Both came with the largest fruit skewer I have ever seen. Fruits were fresh and sweet. 
The duck Benedict was great. LOTS of duck with caramelized onions, the poached eggs were cooked perfectly. And the site of potatoes, OH.MY.GOD. So good, plus you can add one of their hot sauce or Cajun spices, available on the table. 
Then \"I'll take it all\", a plate of eggs your way, French toast, pancake, bacon, herbs sausage, pork rillette, braised ham, beans, potatoes and a side of bread (choice of bread, Baguette or St-Viateur bagel. Scrambled eggs were very fluffy, and probably represented more than two eggs. Ham looked a little like pulled pork and made me regret my benedict choice. Rillette was creamy and topped with pickled onions. I am not a fan of beans but I have to admit that they were good. We did not touch the pancake or French toast so I cannot comment on that. French toast looked a little dry. All plates are served with real maple syrup, which is always a plus. 
Coffee is not included, which I always find a little disappointing. 

Service was great and waitress was smiling and talkative.

TLDR; Go, with ONE friend and your patience. Enjoy the food and decor."}
{"text":"Dear Yelp: I think you need to look into extending the 5-star rating because for places like L'Avenue, 5 stars is a major understatement. 

We were instructed to arrive before 10 a.m but I really doubt that made much of a difference. However, I'm not here to complain, but rather to rave and to let eveyone know that a 40 min. wait for L'Avenue is well worth it!

The place is exquisitely decorated with spray-painted walls and modern-like lamps hung horizontally to the floor. The kitchen is at the very front of a restaurant, which I believe was done on purpose to have all the people waiting in line salivating. Of course I had the eggs benedict to see that the fuss was all about and truth be told I still have really pleasent dreams about those home fries and fresh-cut mushrooms.

Conclusion - when in Montreal, L'Avenue is a must!"}
{"text":"Canadian brunch
Bagels can be got later
Now benedict time

I did my very best in Montreal to make sure every meal was a 5 star meal, and this brunch was no exception. Show up early for a seat, the line goes out the door. We were right on time to be seated as a party of 8, and we were treated awesomely. The duck benedict, salmon benedict, gluten-free pancake, omelettes, coffee, smoothies, all incredible. If you're looking for a great local brunch spot, this place is worth the distance traveled. 

Also, the bathroom is absolutely terrifying."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday around 8:45 am -- it was our last hurrah before driving back home to Boston. There was already a line; Thankfully, we were at the front of it and able to be seated quickly.

My husband ordered a \"I'll have it all\" (which as the name states comes with everything: a fresh fruit croquette, eggs, bacon, sausage, beans, potatoes, french toast, and pancakes served with maple syrup) and I ordered the \"Mister Seguin II\" (eggs benedict with hollandaise, goat cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and potatoes). 

Oh man. Where do I start? Everything here was absolutely AMAZING. This was hands down the BEST brunch of all time (and I'm an avid bruncher). After this place, I feel like I don't need to brunch anymore. It satisfied every brunch need. If I had to pick my favorite of favorites, I'd go with the pancakes and french toast -- both were just so FLUFFY; next would be their crispy and savory potatoes and sausage. My one critique is that the tanginess of the goat cheese was too much in my Mister Seguin II (I would order something different next time -- like a platter of pancakes with a side of potatoes and sausage :)).

Thank you L'Avenue for making me INSANELY happy. This brunch was Epic. 

Interior: modern, street grudge with exposed brick and graffiti; Please stop by the bathroom -- it's THE coolest (just do it). Service: attentive, helpful, and friendly."}
{"text":"I've visited this location on two occasions, approximately 6 weeks apart.

The food is awesome - well worth the wait.

Get here EARLY as the lines get crazy, especially around 10am - noon; expect to wait about 50 minutes in line. For best seating times, go closer to when the restaurant opens.

Tables and area are tightly packed. The atmosphere is really loud once the hustle and bustle starts.

Not that I typically encourage this, but take a trip to the bathroom AND bring your camera: you'll be in for a really cool surprise! Wash your hands after, though, you filthy mcnasties!"}
{"text":"La bavette a l'échalote les frites la salade maison est a essayer et les déjeuners sont très bons aussi l'ambiance casse la baraque...lol  Un incontournable a Montréal."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever. Like, ever ever. We came here based on seeing the Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. We ended up coming here the next day (and we were sad when we left that we couldn't come back another day)!!!

The first time we came, my mom got the Nutella & strawberries French Toast (pain dore) and I got the Miss Perron's Eggs Benedict and we split. It was so so so much food but we could not stop eating it. It was phenomenal. 

The next morning, we got the Classique Eggs Benedict and the Cheddar, Bacon, and Apple French toast. The French toast this time around was absolutely out of this world. As was the E.B. Highly recommend both. 

The coffee is also fabulous. The shakes looked amazing but we couldn't even move we were so full after our meals."}
{"text":"Worth the Wait!
The title of this review eludes the fact that my wife and I had to wait in line for nearly an hour to get in for brunch on a Sunday in late June, 2017. But it was so worth the wait, and I have to say we had great conversations with the people waiting on line with us and the time flew by. When we were finally seated we had our meal and what a meal it was! Eggs, French toast, bacon, fruit, potatoes, a bagel--all delicious! The service was excellent and given with a smile. Coffee and water refilled whenever we wanted. The restaurant is crowded but very charming. We met the owner and he was super nice, as was our server. We were never rushed and took our time enjoying this savory meal. If and when we're back in Montreal, there's no way I'd miss going back to L Avenue."}
{"text":"Probably the best eggs benedict that I've had in Montreal. They had a wide selection of different eggs benedict dishes ranging from $12-20, depending on what you want including Steak, Churrizo, salmon and etc. The dish comes with delicious potatoes as well. The eggs are poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce tastes amazing. It was quite filling and well worth the price. The dish is also served with a beautiful fruit skewer. They also have other brunch dishes, although I haven't gotten a chance to try them yet.  However, they have shakes, smoothies and other dessert items that I felt were overpriced. For example, a chocolate shake was about $7 or so? So I opted to order coffee which was reasonably priced and they refill it throughout the meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant!!! My friend and I visited there around 9:30 am. There was a line up outside, but luckily we only waited for 15 mins to have a seat. 

The menu's design was interesting and the waitress provided us an English one. We asked if we can order only one smoked salmon Benedict eggs to share. The staff was really nice and told us they can help to separate the food into two parts and both of us can have fruit and fries by adding only 2$. We certainly say YES. When the food coming into our table, we felt so   satisfied because it looked so gooood!!

The hollandaise sauce was very creamy, the egg was boiled perfectly, fruits were sweet and fresh, fries were not greasy. Everything was delicious.

Oh! BTW, even their washroom is awesome too. Fluorescent painting on the wall~ Best breakfast made our Montreal to a perfection!"}
{"text":"Quick walk from Mont Royal station. Waited in a small line for about 15 mins. Greeted by a lovely hostess. Restaurant is super busy and seats can be close to the neighbour. Our waitress was super friendly and spoke both English and french. We were given the option of English french menus. I ordered the pancakes with strawberries, blueberries, bananas and dulce de leche whip cream. Servings are HUGE! My hubby orders the eggs Benedict with smoked meat and he devoured it! Restaurant is very clean and staff is very friendly. Washroom os super cool. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's a brunch place and there's tons of those and in the end it's all some variation of eggs and breads, but no! L'Avenue is special: starting from the great service, to the bomb music and all the way to the Benedicts that were an explosion of taste in your mouth. In. Your. Mouth!
Had the streak and eggs Benedict as well as the goat cheese Benedict. Both 10/10 would eat again, and again, and again.

Extra info: check out their trippy bathrooms. I probably spent the same amount there as I did at the table just trying to read/see everything. Some lady shit herself waiting for me, but that's a story for another time"}
{"text":"its THE BEST eggs benedict i ever had in my life. this is a must visit brunch restaurant in Montreal. their egg benedict comes with french toast option which i thought it was unique, and with their creamy hollandaise sauce..HOLY CRAPi wish i could be at montreal right now.

their other dishes are FANTASTIC too!! i had dallas omelet and it was just cooked perfectly!!!! loved it loved it!! 

you will see a water tank filled up with watermelon. and guess what!!!!!!! their water is UNBELIEVABLE!!! so amazing!!! every restaurant should do that!!!!!!!

every dish is served with fruit salad!!! again BRAVO!!!!

Conclusion!! I will FORCE everyone who visits montreal to have brunch here"}
{"text":"Best pancakes in Montreal? I would say so. I got the Sugar Shack which is a little bit of everything (eggs, pancakes, baked beans, beer braised ham, creton, toast, homefries) and I can't remember the last time I was so happy after a meal. I wasn't sure about the ham till our waiter recommended it over the sausage without hesitation. I am glad that I went with it since it wasn't what I was expecting! More like pulled pork than a slice of a ham. Also, I am from Vermont so I thought I knew maple syrup pretty well. The best way to use the stuff now is via can, the Canadian way.  

I'm pretty much going to try to go back as much as possible when we visit. There was a line out the door but the wait wasn't more than a half an hour."}
{"text":"I was super excited about this place because of all the hyped reviews...

I ordered the standard egg Benedict... Too bad it came with piles and piles of dried out ham

Keep in mind if your French is a little rusty this might not be the best breakfast brunch spot

We were there at 10:30/11 ish on a Monday... It was packed. When we walked by in the afternoon it was slammed with a line outside.

Cool bathrooms but I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"One of the best eggs benedict that I've ever had. The hollandaise was excellent, incredibly rich and creamy. This place can get quite busy but my friends and I managed to snag a table for three within seconds! (This was around 11 AM on a Thursday).

The decor was very disco-esque and 80s. There were booths and tables and the restaurant was very narrow but has a lot of space at the back. The service was friendly but not attentive. They would check in on you once in a while but that's okay, I ain't too picky about that. 

I just have to make a comment on this but their washrooms are super cool! Glow in the dark lights made the whites of the washroom illuminate and glow. It felt like I was at a disco party. The toilet paper was also glowing which made me think that the toilet paper that I used was magical."}
{"text":"This place was really cool. Sure there's usually a line but its worth the wait.

The food and fruits that our table ordered were all top notch. The hostess were great and friendly. The decor was cool, but not too...hipsterish?

I would definitely suggest this place to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"The steak and eggs was awesome. Definitely one of my favorite brunches. The service was not great. Did not check in with us during the meal."}
{"text":"Nothing really to complain about except for the lineup. Get the INDECISIVE plate trust me, you won't regret it"}
{"text":"The food and service are great. Interesting menu design and you can easily find all kind of breakfast dishes from sweet to sauvory here!"}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday at around 1pm and we waited for over an hour. It was unfortunately cold that day too! I had the duck Benedict and it was delicious! I couldn't finish (actually, none of my female friends could -- we all ate around half so I highly suggest splitting if you aren't ravenous). There was a lot more food than expected on the plate! Cost was on the pricier side but I think it's worth it given the extra presentation and fancier menu options (helloooo free range eggs!!). My friends also had the crab cake Benedict and it was also good! Both the duck and the crab cakes were really dense though (but rich and tasty) but that's probably why we were so full after eating just one. I'll be back to try out the other menu items! They all looked so good that I had a hard time choosing. The only thing is the wait time and service was a little slower than I'd like it to be."}
{"text":"You figure breakfast food can't really change very much or that it's pretty much the same.  Prepare to be proved wrong.   Restaurant L'Avenue is THE BEST breakfast restaurant I've ever been to. 

I used to really think Cora's was really good. Don't get me wrong Cora's  is still good, but after you try this place you'll understand why. 

The bread and butter of Restaurant L'avenue is their Eggs Benedict, they are AMAZING.  To tell you the truth, after hearing all the reviews about this place I didn't even bother to try anything else. And once it hits your mouth... there's no turning back. 

L'avenue's Eggs Benedicts come in a variety of flavours (about 12). They range from classic to asparagus to chorizo to \"steak and eggs\". While we're on that subject, their steak and eggs are actually Eggs Benedict... with a steak in the middle.

I ordered the chorizo Eggs Benedict and decided to swap and share with my friend's steak and eggs. Each order comes with 2 Benedict's and a ramekin of rosemary infused homefries. 

I can tell you now that both of the selections were fantastic. I'm not even sure which one my favourite is. They're both amazing.       

The hollandaise is freshly made and is topped generously on top of a pouched egg and English muffin. The steak isn't really made to order in terms of \"doneness\" but it's pretty much a fast fry steak. I don't know if it's on purpose but some of the rosemary potatoes got in the Benedict as well, which made it even better. 

You really know something is made well when you don't need condiments to go with the food. The potatoes are baked with a Rosemary infused oil and are delicious. Beware, it is really heavy and filling. I had a bit of trouble finishing everything. 

In a 3 day trip to Montreal I had to visit Restaurant L'avenue twice.  In fact I would easily eat here every day (if I had an unlimited bank card). In Montreal?  Go here. 

Ps apparently people in montreal know this place is good too. Be prepared for a lineup out the door. Wait for it, it'll be the best decision of your life."}
{"text":"I actually got really really sick after having brunch for a good 3 days. Not sure what it was specifically or maybe just the combo. 

The resto is cute and decorated in an edgy way. Love the mirrors and motorcycle. Famously known for their blue bathroom, however there was nothing to dry your hands with. We had to ask several times for hot sauce before we finally got it. But overall we had good service. 

I had the Oreo cookies milkshake which is in an enormous glass. It's pretty much a meal of its own. I couldn't even finish half of it. It was good though. Then we were served fruits on a skewer. It's a great way to have someone start breakfast in a healthy way, but also not let them starve while they wait for the actual food. I had the salmon eggs Benedict. I'm not a fan of salmon but I wanted to give it a try and honestly that's probably the last time I eat it. I find the portions are much smaller compared to other restos, especially the potatoes. They serve you on a huge plate but the plate seemed empty. I would go back to try something else from the menu but I'm not too eager because of how sick I was."}
{"text":"We came here for a father's day breakfast. It was super yummy! We got here at 8:15 and it was pretty empty. Full by 8:50ish,though! Great food with generous portions. We are from Texas so we know what big portions are!
Great place!"}
{"text":"I'm a little neutral towards L'avenue. Although the food was good, I feel that people overhyped it. I checked reviews before going and I was prepared for the 45 minute wait for the food (even for just a milkshake) but they all mentioned that the wait would be worth it... I would have to say otherwise. The cheesy eggs were almost too cheesy. The steak was overlooked (in my opinion, I'm assuming some people prefer it well done) and my boyfriend had a normal plate of eggs and bacon but the eggs were not seasoned. I was a little disappointed and I'm not sure I'll return.

HOWEVER, a plus, they give you a small complimentary fruit plate the moment you sit down.

POSITIVE: I loveddddd the oldies music, 
I was just picturing waiters on roller blades the whole time, I loved the vibe.

CON: It is PACKED. It's not the best location to have a conversation. 

Side note: CHECK OUT THE BATHROOMS! Absolutely awesome."}
{"text":"Taking the first bite of any eggs Benedict at restaurant l'avenue is as good as your first orgasm. They have so many different combinations to pick from. Home fries are amazing and they have the coolest bathrooms. Great service and excellent staff!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning for brunch.  Long line outside, and could tell it was a popular place.  We waited at least 40 minutes to get seated.  That was probably the worst part of the experience.  Everything else after that was great.

We had timely service, and the food was sensational.  They start you off with some fresh fruit on a stick (watermelon, apples, etc.) which was nice and sweet.

For the main dish, I got the Eggs Benedict Classique (which is the first thing they had on the menu) and it was great.  I was starving, and this plate was delicious.  Hard to describe.  The portions were also very large.  You just have to go there to taste it.  It was very flavorful.  

The atmosphere of the restaurant is casual and trendy.  There was nice wall art inside the restaurant.  Even the bathroom is a must-visit lol with glow in the dark wall art.

The waitress also provided timely and friendly service.  Nothing to complain about.  

I would recommend this restaurant to tourists and Montreal locals alike."}
{"text":"Second time here, totally worth the long queue. 

Officially my favorite brunch restaurant. L'avenue continues to astound with their extremely top notch dishes. I wish I could pin point one dish and say it's a must try but this place has it all. 
As amazing as this is, I am always tempted to jump over to the next table and dig my face into their dishes as well (please be warned) 

Orange juice is fresh, chorizo eggs Benedict is what I forced my friends to order. The raspberry Nutella milkshake was from another magical world. 

I extremely loved the service as well, even while at the queue they kept us informed on how long it would take. 

I'd recommend everyone to surely go here, but plan it out and go early so you wouldn't be stuck waiting and starving. 

This place is the epitome of a perfect restaurant experience and I hope it continues to be the same. 

Love the huge mirror through which I could check out dishes others had without seeming stalker-ish. 
Also be sure to check out the restrooms, it really is something"}
{"text":"You will not leave hungry. Portions are huge!

They have tons of egg and egg benedict creations...I tried the eggs benny with Montreal smoked meat, which was delicious but too big to finish. Hubby tried the crepe with pork/cheese/apple. It was enormous. He enjoyed it but I thought it was just okay, not great.

Similarly, the juice creations (we tried mango/pineapple/litchi) and glass of sangria were huge.

They sure do it big at L'Avenue!

Note: the extensive menu is in French only, so even though servers are happy to 'assist'...if you don't speak a word of French, you may be too embarrassed to have them translate every single item on the menu :) Just saying."}
{"text":"Great brunch place in a lovely area of Montreal! Went with some visiting family members for brunch and loved both the ambience and the food. I ordered the eggs benedict with duck, mushrooms, and onions and almost could not finish it. Be prepared to be full with your selection. 

There is always a bit of a line outside but it's totally worth the wait. The decor indoors is super fun and can get a little loud but if you're into that kind of busy atmosphere you will love it. 

The only downside was being seated next to the washrooms. There are only two stalls so a lineup started to form right next to us and took away from the atmosphere a bit but we were really concentrated on our food so it didn't really take away from the experience much.

Go there with an empty stomach :)"}
{"text":"Plan in advance to wait on line if you come here after 10 AM, especially if you're a group of three or more. The four of us waited about 40-50 minutes on line before we got seated. There is complimentary coffee by the entrance if you're freezing.

Once inside, my friends ordered the steak & eggs while I got the omelette with herbs, tomatoes, and shrimp, and we decided to share french toast. Everyone liked their food. For my omelette, I wish the ingredients were mixed around better - I had tomatoes in one end, shrimp in another. It tasted better when I got everything in one bite.

Our french toasted had Nutella, bananas, coconut, and a reduced caramel Jack Daniels sauce. It was good and not overly sweet. You can order the same item as a crepe, but be advised that it's not the thin type of crepe. It's actually pancakes.

I took off a star for the wait time, but don't let that detract you from coming here. Our waitress was great, checked in periodically, and we were able to enjoy a relaxing brunch."}
{"text":"If I'm in Montreal, you can bet that I'll be brunching at l'avenue at least once during my visit. Maybe even two or three times. It's just that good. 

Minus the fact that they don't take reservations and it can take a while to get seated on the weekends, l'avenue is nothing short of amazing. Great food and drinks, solid service, dope bathrooms and there's free WiFi for all those Americans with their phones on airplane mode like me. Gotta love it.

I always get the Steak Eggs Benedict, which is by far the best I've ever had. The hollandaise is rich and creamy and the steak perfectly seasoned and cooked. It comes with savory potatoes, which only adds to the meal. Each dish also comes with a fruit skewer, which is greatly appreciated.

I also love their smoothies. Not too sweet and super fresh. My favorite ones include mango. Mm mmm mmmm. 

I just wish this place was closer to NYC. I seriously just can't get enough!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were visiting Montreal for the weekend and decided to try out this restaurant. 
He got the confit omelet with carmelized onion, apple and Brie cheese and it was delicious. The confit was cooked perfectly and went well with the other ingredients to give it a nice, savory taste. 
I ordered the caramelized banana crepes and my food was equally as good, but a lot sweeter. 
I liked the vibe and everyone working there was really nice. I will definitely be back if in Montreal again."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting Montreal and my second time getting breakfast at L'Avenue. The food is AMAZING and the service is impeccable. Both times I've had Renaud as a server and he is so great. He's got a great attitude and is so friendly. I hope he's my server the next time I visit because I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious, Decadent, Divine! One of the best brunches I'v ever had. Everything on the plate tasted simply amazing. I ordered Hevous Racheros and my husband got the greek omelet. Most of their dishes come with huge side of fruits and delicious potatoes. The orange juice my husband ordered was so fresh & yum I had to order another one for myself. Quantities are huge. We both ended up taking half of the plate to go. 

The only downside is the wait. We ended up waiting for 45 mins to be seated. Many of the reviews in yelp already talked about the wait so I knew what I was up against and trust me the food is well worth the wait. The other thing that bothered me was their french menu. They don't have an english one for outsiders :(. Nevertheless, hands down the best brunch I'v ever had."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker with access to a million + 1 restaurants, L'avenue will always be my favorite brunch spot and holds a special place in my heart.

My group of 6 had to wait 1.5 hours on a Saturday to get a table, as there are no reservations. I've never had to wait more than 30 minutes for a restaurant in NYC so I said \"this shit better be worth it\", and boy was it! We got in and had delicious fruit smoothies that are served in margarita glasses with cute umbrellas.

I had the French toast drizzles with jack Daniel sauce, coconut flakes, bananas, and caramel.  I think about that dish sometimes when I feel depressed. It was the best French toast I've had in my life. Others in my table had the steak and potatoes and I basically ate half their food for them because it was so good. The portions are hugeeee and the food is cheap! (Less than $20 an entree).

1 year later and my friends and I still talk about L'avenue until today, and say we'd take a flight out to Montreal just for this restaurant. It's just that worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambiance. 

We had a big group, 8 of us and even though there was a line the wait wasn't too bad to get a table for us all, they took care of us and didn't seem resentful about 8 loud half-drunk americans. Service was a bit slow, but i'm also from the states where i think we take our fast service for granted, everywhere we went service was slow and by the time we got to l'avenue we had learnt to accept it. 

Our waiter was awesome, can't remember his name but he took care of us, gave recommendations and sent us on our way with some parting shots. 

All but one of us got the chorizo eggs benedict, and we didn't regret it. Perfect brunch meal after a night of drinking. Ordered beers but some others had their cocktails and mentioned they were strong and delicious. 

Make sure to visit the restroom on your way out, completes the visit (weird, i know, but trust me)

If i'm back in MTL anytime soon i will definitely be making another stop!"}
{"text":"Wow! There is a reason that there's always a line for this place! This is the best brunch place in MTL! The steak eggs benny with Portobello mushrooms will give you the best food coma you've ever had! Their milkshakes are amazing too! 

For what you're getting (fruit with every meal) it's a great deal!"}
{"text":"L'Avenue is a highly hyped brunch establishment that has lines out the door, even in freezing temperatures! This kept popping up as THE BRUNCH SPOT to dine at in Montreal. 
I love Montreal and I love brunch, so this was a no-brainer. My girlfriend and I painfully waited outside for 45 minutes but had peace of mind knowing we would soon enter the greatest brunch spot in the area. 

Upon entering, we were quickly seated, given water and menus. We ordered a hot Latte, an Iced Latte, and a Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice to start. The Orange juice came out quickly and we were assured the rest of the drinks were to follow. We then proceeded to order our entree's. I ordered the Bacon and Cheddar Omelet with a bagel, hash and fruit and my girlfriend ordered the sweet and savory benedict.

My omelet was one of the worst ones ever eaten. It was flavorless eggs left to burn in a pan and flipped once with no seasoning. Eating it felt like a chore. There was no flavor, it was so strange. The bagel was freshly baked from a local bakery, however, the bagel was flat and flavorless. The best part of my meal was their complementary fruit.

My girlfriends sweet and savory benedict was interesting. It was breaded french toast topped with ham and a poached egg. The first few bites were interesting. It tasted good given the diverse flavors. The dish fell short and should have contained powdered sugar or more sugaring within the breaded french toast. It had a great crunch but fell short of being 'sweet'. 

Halfway through our meal, my girlfriend's latte finally came out. It had a strange chemical aftertaste. My iced latte wasn't served until after my meal was finished despite numerous inquiries about it. The iced latte was again, flavorless. It was a watered down latte. I saw several disgruntled customers complaining about service around us, despite having a large staff presence. 

Overall, I had an unpleasant visit. I would not go back. With that said, many others had positive experiences and I would encourage those who are curious to try it for themselves!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! The potatoes are perfectly flavored and the crab cake Benedict is to die for"}
{"text":"Really cool place! I had veggie Benedict and it was one of the best I have had in a longggg time! Husband had his with corn beef hash I think and he absolutely loved it too. They also have a very cool black light lit bathroom!"}
{"text":"The most amazing brunch my husband and I ever had! We waited about an hour on line outside to get a table,  but it was more than worth it! Will totally do it again the next time we're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"So, one thing to definitely point out about this place is the waiting line. It's no lie when the reviews say you will wait for about an hour to an hour and a half to be seated on the weekends. This was my only concern with L'avenue. 
On the brighter side, everything from the service to the food was impeccable. I had gotten the Big Boy breakfast that was good overload. The potatoes were well seasoned. The pancakes and french toast were literally the best I've had in Montreal. The hot chocolate was a drink for the Gods. 
Now, the bathroom. Yes, the bathroom. Even if you don't have to go, go. Coolest bathroom I've ever witnessed in a restaurant. Would totally recommend this place and will come back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Vraiment excellent. En accord avec la réputation de ce lieux qui est plébiscité par nombreux de mes amis.

La carte est vraiment intéressante, grosse diversité en sucré et en salé. On en sait plus où donner de la tête. les prix sont normaux.

Lorsque l'on prend les ufs bénédictines vous avez en plus une grosse brochette de fruit qui déjà vous remplira bien le ventre ! Ajoutez à cela les petites patates rissolés très bonne on commence déjà à être bien ! Et puis que dire des ufs bénédictines, un régale. Le steack and eggs est magnifique, super goût et rien à dire. Celui avec poulet et poivrons est aussi très bon, rien à redire.

Nous avions aussi commandé des jus, quel bonheur. Une énorme coupe arrive avec par dessus le jus encore une petite brochette de fruit. Ils sont très bons.

Vraiment je suis très content de ma venue et je suis sur de revenir pour braver la foule et m'empiffrer d'ufs béné et de pancake. 

Conseil : venez avant 10h pour trouver facilement de la place sinon la queue va vous décourager ;-)"}
{"text":"Great experience! I can easily say this was the best place I've ever had a brunch. We were waiting on the line around 30-40 min. It was really cold but gosh after try the food I literally can say totally worth to wait. You better be super hungry when you go there.They start with plate of fruits . They serve one of the best coffee  . Try the milkshake but in a same time remember you have too many food and milk shake is huge :)
The food was simply amazing. I wish I live in Montreal and go there every Sunday :) their French toast was one of the best. I loved the food  the waiter was so nice and friendly. It is a pricy place but I think totally worth it ;)"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a friend after reading a few reviews online. The wait was ridiculous and it didn't help that it was the coldest weekend of the year. I thought we were all crazy for standing in he cold to get a table. Thankfully, the food was worth the wait. Absolutely loved the chorizo eggs benedict. My mimosa was made with fresh squeezed orange juice which was refreshing. I also really enjoyed the complimentary fruit. Our waitress was super sweet and attentive. I hope to be back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite brunch resto! Nothing beats the comfort food at L'avenue. I love their french toasts and eggs benedicts. Sadly, when I came back to Montreal for the holidays, I noticed they removed the caramelized bananas off the menu. Oddly enough, they caramelize kiwis, strawberries, pears but they can't do bananas anymore? Will someone tell me why! Nonetheless it is still my favorite brunch place. The resto is not very spacious, the decor is funky and the wait is very long but its worth it."}
{"text":"The food was great, the menu is only French, Alex is amazing waiter he will help you to order the best. Btw he's hottoo ask him for his number:P"}
{"text":"Food: I'd give the place a 3.5. Ordered the pancake with nutella, strawberrys and whipped cream. I also ordered eggs, bacon and maple syrup. The pancake was a 9/10...straight up delicious. The eggs were a 2/10 (no flavor). The bacon was a 1/10 (flavorless, thin and just breaks apart when you lift it). The maple syrup had no flavor as well, but I guess thats what makes it work on pancakes that already have so much going on with them. 

Service: 7/10. Nothing special. Not bad. We did have to wait outside during brunch hours due to overcrowding. The dining area is also very cramped. You'll find yourself sitting extremely close to other people while eating.

If I ever do come back to montreal, i may re-visit this spot (if Tim Horton's runs out of maple bagels). It's not worth staying on a line for. I hold Canada to high standards due to the food in Ontario. Senator's and Emma's Country Kitchen in Toronto have spoiled my taste buds."}
{"text":"I waited out in the cold rain for almost an hour to try this place and it was worth It! The best eggs Benedict I've ever had, great staff and such cool art everywhere!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Montreal. 

Despite the long line up, my experience at L'Avenue is always positive. 

The menu has a lot of options and everything I've tried have been great. Portion sizes are generous and quality is always consistent. 

While the restaurant is always jammed packed, the service is always friendly, fast, and thorough. 

 Try their speciality drinks."}
{"text":"This restaurant has like 15 different kinds of eggs benedict on the menu. We decided to split two of them. One was semi-typical, but with some sauteed veggies on it. The other one we ordered though was pretty out there. Instead of the usual base of english muffin, it was built upon the most delicious French toast, which was encrusted with maple syrupy panko, and then topped with ham. Damnnnnn. Prefect combination of sweet, salty, and savory. 

Beware, this food is extremely rich. We were both stuffed eating only half a plate each, and could have easily split just one."}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly recommended to us from locals and received rave reviews on yelp, so we wanted to check out the place for ourselves. Overall I must say this place was awesome. From the moment we walked in our waiter, Eli, was patient and kind enough to over the menu with us since we weren't fluent in French. I ordered the eggs Benedict with chipotle sausage. It was my first time ever trying     this dish and I must say I blown away when I had to the first bite . In the states when you're given water it's either flavored with a lemon or cumber, but at this restaurant they flavor it with watermelon and you can actually see the wedges in water dispenser, I thought that was cool. They serve large portions, so one might be leaving with left overs. This restaurant is pretty popular in the area, so you need to head there early when they open because you'll be waiting in a long line to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"I went here a few winters ago with my two sisters for brunch on a Saturday. I did not expect the wait to be two hours. We were super hungry and freezing from waiting outside in the line. 

When we got in, our endurance paid off, and we were greeted with giant plates of eggs benedict, various fruits, potatoes, salad, and hot coffee. The portion sizes were huge and we finished everything in minutes as we were starving. They have a good variety of breakfasts, both sweet and salty. 

And as always with brunch in Montreal... go early."}
{"text":"I found this place thanks to my fellow Yelpers. A bit of a distance from where I was staying but trust me, it's worth the drive and the wait! I arrived during the week around 11ish and the restaurant was packed. It was about a 10-15 minute wait. The restaurant is very narrow so seating can be a bit tight if seated at a table. To start, I ordered the strawberry and watermelon mimosa. It tasted very healthy and although I could see the bubbly, I thought no alcohol was in it... Until I got to the bottom of the glass. Lol. It was delicious. For my meal I ordered the first meal under Bachelor #1 (if looking at the menu- sorry forgot the name of it) which came with French toast, 2 range-free eggs, bacon, breakfast potatoes and a bowl of fruit compote. I asked the waitress what range-free is and I still couldn't comprehend the difference but they tasted like regular eggs in my opinion. Nonetheless,  the meal was amazing! The homemade Canadian syrup was perfect with the French toast. The potatoes were another fav,  bacon cooked just right and not burnt and the fruit were fresh & added a healthy ending. There was no way i could get to the toast or finish the rest of my potatoes (& I LOVE potatoes). 

From glancing around, I can't imagine what a weekend crowd looks like or how long the wait time is.  I also noticed they serve water infused with fresh watermelon. There is a full bar. The waitress was very attentive and delivered service with a smile. The menu was pretty comical and creative and some of the names resembled other cities/countries around the world. I would highly recommend this place if you're in the area and looking for a breakfast/brunch spot. It's worth the drive/bus ride and the wait! Kudos."}
{"text":"We tried coming here yesterday and the line was long so decided to not go but the next day was our last day and we went right in the morning and got in straight away!

The good was amazing I had original benny and it was like no other my husband had the salted pretzel pancakes and it was unreal !!

Great way to finish the trip ! Keep it up"}
{"text":"Always...totally worth it! Dress warm from October on cuz its at least 20 minutes wait outside!"}
{"text":"busy place means good place. 
Waited for 15mins
but worth it. Big portions, waiters are nice
bathroom is cool, so many selections for breakfast.
infused water was good. price ranges around 10-15$"}
{"text":"Trendy, delicious, and clean. Perfect brunch spot. Busy for a good reason. We were seated very quickly nevertheless. Benedict and omelets are the main draws. Coffee was excellent. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best brunch in town! 

Yes, the line is very long and you could even end up waiting at 9am on the weekends. But I've found the wait to be well worth it. The different kind of meals being served always makes the choice hard to make and I've never been disappointed. Also make sure to check out the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Montreal over labor day weekend and had a wonderful breakfast at Restaurant l'avenue.  the wait wasn't all that long and my son to this day raves about the breakfast he had.  Great service, ambiance and fantastic food."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've ever been to. Highly recommended if you are a big eggs benedict fan, especially the steak & eggs, and the wild mushrooms & lardon. High possibility of waiting in line on weekends though."}
{"text":"Long wait to get in but it was well worth it. Cute and fun atmosphere. We new it would be Good when it starts with watermelon filtered Water.  I had eggs Benedict classic and it was amazing. My husband had huevos rancheros and he loved it. My daughter had the pretzel pancakes and it was too sweet. That's why we give 4 vs. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good environment to start the morning. The portion size is big. The foods are really yummy!"}
{"text":"Lord knows I hate waiting in line for a restaurant but on one of the coldest days of the month during the Christmas holidays, I decided to check this place out with my cousin who was visiting from NYC, in hopes that no one was crazy enough to leave the house for brunch. When we arrived the line was only just out the door, compared to down the block as it often is on a usual weekend. We maybe waited 30 minutes before getting seated near the door but I was happy to be sitting indoors! 

The service was fantastic, quick and very friendly. Waiter was nice enough to decipher the extensive menu for us even though the place was packed. I opted for their pancakes with cheddar and bacon; portion was huge and I really liked the sweet and savoury mix too! 

Overall, the food was great, portions were humongous, and the price point is more than reasonable for what you're getting. I'm not a big fan of \"extreme\" brunch spots where I can't finish the plate, but I'd return to L'Avenue as the menu is interesting and fun, with plenty of flavourful choices for all."}
{"text":"Bon d'habitude j'essaie d'éviter les line-ups le matin... surtout quand j'ai besoin d'un café genre Là-là! Mais franchement, nous avons attendu une quinzaine de minutes et j'en aurais même attendu 40 tellement c'était bon! En plus d'être une grande fan de déjeuner/brunch! Bonus, c'est dans mon coin (à deux pas du marché Atwater)! 

Nous étions deux, nous avons eu l'impression de manger pour 10 tellement les portions sont copieuses et... c'était juste TROP BON! Il y a un énorme choix sur le menu et certains des noms de plats sont pas mal cocasses. Pour ma part j'ai opté pour \"Tout le monde à poêle\", des oeufs bénés avec lardons et champignons! Rien de tout nu dans mon assiette! Selon moi, j'ai fait le meilleur choix du menu parce que WOW! Mais selon mon amie, c'est elle qui a fait le meilleur choix en optant pour les bénés \"Steak & eggs\". Fait que let's agree to disagree!

Bref, les déjeuners sont malades, le service est bein smath et le décor est coloré! À refaire.. dimanche prochain?"}
{"text":"Now listen here, I eat a lot of brunch, but this is probably as good as it gets. I had been eyeing the carrot cake pancakes for the duration of our half-hour wait in line, but when it came time to order, I chickened out and ordered the grilled chicken egg white omelet instead (no pun intended). The omelet was studded with chunks of grilled chicken as well as spinach and swiss cheese and was absolutely delicious and satisfying. On the side, they offered homemade jam that I happily spread onto my gorgeously toasty baguette. Luckily, my friend ended up ordering the carrot cake pancakes so I got few fork-fulls in and boy oh boy were they good. Although my omelet was pretty great, it would be foolish to order anything by those pancakes. Fluffy, sweet, and smeared with cream cheese frosting and walnut pieces, I still dream about them sometimes."}
{"text":"Oh my my!! This place is THE BEST Breakfast/ Brunch I've ever had in my LIFE and I think it will remain the best till I live. This restaurant has set the expectations bar just toooo high for me.
It has long queue all the time; from the time it opens till the time it closes. So be prepared to wait in line for 20-25 mins before you will get the table. And please do wait otherwise you will miss something out of the world. You will miss one of the BEST MEALS you will ever have in your life.
I wish this place was in Toronto and I could have had easy access to this HOLY GRAIL.
When you go inside you will see that all the tables are jam packed but the servers are very nice they will make you feel comfortable and get you seated.
Do checkout their washrooms they are FANCY!!
After the server gave us the menu, I realized everything on the menu sounded so interesting that I wanted to try out everything because you guys know that I live in Toronto and can't come here everyday to have breakfast.
So, I decided to ordered the dish called \"Indecisive\". Yes, they do have a dish by this name because they get customers like me everyday who wants to taste just everything on their menu.
Indecisive comes with 2 choices of savoury choices and 1 choice of sweet choice. It also comes with 2 free range eggs of your choice, breakfast potatoes and fresh fruit brochette. My husband ordered steak and eggs. This also comes with fresh fruit brochette. I also order Mango, Pineapple and Lychee Exotic juice.
Before our food arrived they served us fresh fruit brochette. All the fruits were actually freshly cut and good quality.
They arrived our food with coffee and the exotic juice I ordered. 
Steak and eggs that my husband ordered was delicious and cooked to perfection. Coffee was great too.
I had ordered scrambled eggs with bacon, homemade sausage and French Toast. Sausage was mind-blowing, Bacon was nice and crisp. And I literally don't have words to explain how good or great or out of the world that French Toast was. I have never had and I guess I never will have a French toast as good as it was. It was crisp from the top and as soon as you take a bite in your mouth it melted as custard. Really felt like I was having a super high quality custard which has a crisp top.
You need to try this place and experience it yourself. No review can tell you enough about this place."}
{"text":"Came here once, about a year ago, the taste didn't change, still had line up. 
It was too busy, we waited 10 mins for the menu after sat down.
The food was awesome"}
{"text":"The iconic Montreal Brunch experience. Everything here is excellent and well thought-out. One bite of the caramelized banana and Nutella french toast is heaven melting in your mouth. The egg Benedict served here is one of the best I've ever. Also check out their bathrooms!"}
{"text":"There is a long wait for a seat but it was worth the it. The brunch here is amazing. The fruit screwer that everyone gets is good. But the French toast I got that had the Caramelized Bananas with Nutella/Chocolate and whatever that syrup they put on it was one of the best French toast dishes I every had. Sorry I don't know what it is on the menu because everything was in French. But ask the waitress she will know what you talking about. Everything me and my friend was good. The hash browns are tasty. The smoothies looked very good even though I didn't have one. I am glad I am found this place on my Montreal vacation."}
{"text":"This place... Is WILD. Easily the best brunch place I've been to in the past few years. To keep it short:

Food 5/5: We got the Bobby Does Dallas (scrambled eggs, sautéed onions, steak, BBQ sauce, and potatoes with a buttered baguette) and the strawberry, banana, blueberries, and dulce de leche pancakes. Ridiculous portion sizes (especially from what I've seen in Montreal), would easily send a smallish person like myself into a food coma. The watermelon infused water and orange mimosa we had was also very nice. 

Service/Atmosphere: 5/5 quirky atmosphere and incrediblely attentive service."}
{"text":"First off, I am most likely one of the pickiest people in the world when it comes to food. My wife and I ate there two days ago and it might be the best breakfast I have ever experienced. Get the Chorizo Eggs Benedict! A bit pricey, but I do not mind paying for quality. Cool atmosphere, nice execution by staff to accommodate one's every need, and great food! What more could you want?  If you are in Montreal this place is a must. Do it! Just go there--you owe it to yourself. :)"}
{"text":"In one word: Fantastic. specialty is eggs Benedict and they just might be the best there is at it. From the moment I got there, I was impressed with the off-beat decor. There was about a 20 minute wait for weekday brunch and it was worth every minute of it. Their America crepes are good too, but know that this means pancakes, not crepes. We made this mistake, but can't really complain because it was done so well. My wife got a chicken sandwich, because she does not fancy eggs. It was good for what it was, but nowhere near as special as their Benedicts."}
{"text":"Delightful combination of very good food, friendly service and reasonable prices. Done up with an edgy, punky decor. My absolute fave in Montreal for breakfast/brunch. (Real maple syrup; no extra charge)"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon expérience à L'Avenue ! Les longues minutes d'attente à l'extérieur en valent la chandelle ! Parce que oui, il faut savoir que si vous décidez de venir bruncher ou goûter, ou peu importe, il vous faudra être patients et être prêts à attendre avant de pouvoir vous installer. Il semble que L'Avenue soit The place to be ! Et j'ai vite compris pourquoi. La déco est génial, le personnel agréable et accueillant. Côté choix, il y en a pour tous les goûts, en plus, on vous accueille avec une jolie brochette de fruits pour patienter un peu, pas bien longtemps parce que le service est également rapide. Mon choix s'est tourné du côté des oeufs bénédictine, dont je raffole pour les brunches ! Et je n'ai pas été décue avec l'assiette de Monsieur Seguin (je ne me rappelle plus de l'intitulé exact). La sauce hollandaise était une réussite et les pommes de terre, mon Dieu les pommes de terre étaient juste incroyablement bonnes ! Je n'ai jamais mangé de pommes de terre aussi bonne pour un brunch ! Le seul bémol, c'est qu'ils n'accompagne pas l'assiette d'une petite salade de fruits (parce que j'aime les brunches sucré-salé), mais je ne leur en tient absolument pas rigueur puisque qu'ils servent une brochette de fruits à notre arrivée (qu'il aurait peut être fallu que je garde pour mon brunch justement !). 
Et les toilettes... Je vous assure qu'elles en valent le détour !! Elles sont somptueuses et totalement futuristes je trouve. 
Le prix reste dans la gamme de prix d'un brunch à mon humble avis, la facture ne m'a pas parue dispendieuse, de toute facon, c'était tellement bon !
Bref, j'ai adoré mon expérience et j'ai juste hâte d'y retourner !!"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Great service and food as well. The bathrooms are the coolest I've ever been in. I would most certainly come here again!"}
{"text":"This artsy and fun bistro in the Plateau neighborhood is clearly popular with locals at brunch, and it features a French-only menu. It was one of my more memorable dining experiences in Montreal. The brunch menu consists of typical omelets, french toast, and breakfast foods, but the specialty of the house is the eggs benedict. I'm normally not a fan of the runny Benedict, but I did enjoy the chorizo benedict a great deal. The atmosphere is artsy and hipster, and the crowd tended towards the same. The music was great. It was a great meal and a fun place to people watch. We arrived around 1 pm and had no wait or line.

The bathroom was awesome. If you miss it, you will be \"blue\".

One area for improvement for this restaurant is the service. We were seated quickly, but then left for at least 7-10 minutes without any menu or assistance. When we requested something, the waiter would disappear for long periods. I realize that we Americans tend to get into a rush at restaurants, but the service bordered on the neglectful. If I have to hunt down a server to request a menu, something needs to be addressed in terms of attitudes or staffing. Once we had the food, I was delighted."}
{"text":"Probably the most amazing breakfast I've ever had. The waitress was amazing with the service especially when it was my friend's birthday. Loved the duck egg benedict. Would eat again!!!"}
{"text":"My son came here last year and raved about it when he came home. So this year I decided to take a trip to Montreal. This is one of the best brunch places I've tried. I'm from nyc so I have pretty high standards. My favorite dish is the mushroom and bacon eggs Benedict. I will ask for the hollainase sauce separately next time."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of the original avenue on Mount-Royal , therefore heading into the one on Notre Dame , I had very high expectations. To my surprise , I thought the one on Notre Dame may be better than the original one. The food was exceptional, the fruits always seem to be in season ,  and the staff was extremely friendly. We had a waitress named Lilly which was extremely helpful in helping us with our dietary needs. The bathroom was very trendy as was the decoration of the restaurant. I would highly recommend this restaurant however I don't think they need my recommendation because the line up during the weekends speak for themselves. My only recommendation is go during the week, but besides that it's the best restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great, easily the best Eggs Benny I've had in a while, I had the spicy chicken eggs and they were a revelation. The portions are pretty huge, I eat a lot but even I couldn't finish this, it was excellent."}
{"text":"Really good..  had a great time here and was lucky to not have to wait. Had the Coconut Caramel chocolate banana french toast and almost cried lol.. will not ever forget that feeling.. that sauce is a must in you life plus the bread has a really good texture and flavour (huge). We also had the breakfast that comes with everything so we did not miss out.. and it was really nice, as far a common breakfast goes. but some of their omelets and breakfast casseroles I spotted looked to be more yummy and unique, need to try again. fruit kebobs and maple syrup are a big plus."}
{"text":"Lives up to the original on Mount Royal!

Love that they provide the option of Portobello mushrooms instead of English muffins for the eggs Benedict. 

Great space with WIFI. 

Still waiting for 3rd wave coffee to make it mainstream :/
I want a pour-over with my poached eggs xD"}
{"text":"The place to go in Montreal for eggs Benedict. 
So many delicious options. I had the \"Tout l'monde à poëlle\" I loved it, very rich however so not for everyone. 
My date got the \"À la bretonne\" which was much lighter tasting but just as delicious. 
Bonus, everyone gets a fruit skewer!
I will definitely be back to try another variety of eggs Benedict. 
You can sub the English muffins for portobello mushrooms!
Great for those avoiding grains or gluten.
I wish they would opt for free range, organic, eggs (even with the large amount traffic) instead of the omega 3."}
{"text":"Wow. We ate here based on a recommendation in a guidebook, so we weren't sure what to expect. The menu made us wonder what we'd gotten ourselves into, as it just looks like a plastic, spiral-bound book of random sandwiches, burgers, and other dishes. The one sign that we were in for something good was the fact that the restaurant was packed on a Tuesday evening. I ordered the chicken marsala, and my friend ordered the chicken curry. After a longish wait (the slow service was our one complaint), we were presented with large plates of amazing food. Seriously, on the first bite, we were both stunned at how good our meals were - fresh, flavorful, and delicious. Unfortunately we were running a little late, so we had to eat fast, but I will definitely return the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"As tourists, this was a wonderful brunch experience. Service is friendly, decor is modern and upbeat, portions are Goliath massive, and the food is delicious. We're so glad we picked this spot for breakfast during our touristy weekend in Montreal. 

First, note that there's a wait. And they don't take reservations. We arrived right when it opened at 8:00 AM (we're morning people) on a Saturday morning and there was already a lineup. We waited about 5 minutes or so, and we were seated at a booth towards the middle of the restaurant. 

Second, if you're driving. Street parking is free on Saturdays before 9:00 AM. Luckily, we finished eating just in time - otherwise, you will have to pay (watch for the signs indicating the times you can and cannot park).

Third, the food. The menu is entirely in French, but our server wisely knew we were tourists and translated what we needed. We had a) the French Toast with apple slices and bacon (which sounds weird but it totally worked), b) Eggs Benny with cheese, mushrooms, and other veggies. The food was delightful but sizes were so big that we found it very difficult to finish everything (share, if you can!). Everything came with a fruit skewer, which was fresh and delicious. We also ordered tea and a Nutella latte (which was okay, didn't really taste the Nutella). Overall, the food is great, service is top notch, so if you can, COME EARLY to avoid a wait for a table.

For two people, with tax, and tip, we paid around $40.00. A hearty breakfast and a great start to a touristy day."}
{"text":"Amazing food, cool decor.  I had the duck eggs benedict on a croissant - the dish is amazing!  Duck, mixed with wild mushrooms.  A side of arugula salad.  Don't think about anything else."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've ever been to!  It's a triple threat - the freshest ingredients in exciting, creative combinations; the quantity is excessive to say the least; and the service was impeccable!  I can't say enough and I promise this isn't a fake review. I hardly ever write these things. 
First off, you should know that there will be a wait (even at 10:30 on a Thursday).  Not too bad at that time, maybe 15-20 min. Not sure about weekends. It was a short walk west from the Mont-Royal metro station. 
We had three awesome smoothies to start with big fresh fruit garnishes. They were all good and all tasted really healthy. Even my son's apple juice was fresh made that morning. 
Each of us then got a beautiful fresh fruit ka-bob before our meals. Big and healthy, yum. 
I had the eggs Benedict with salmon. Loved it!  It all tasted so fresh and perfectly cooked. The shock was that there were two of them!  This is a meal that will stick with you a very long time. I hardly touched the hash brown potatoes. They were also great but I just didn't have room. 
My wife had the eggs Benedict with mushrooms and bacon. Again, huge, fresh, and tasty. This was a little more \"earthy\" than mine but she's not a big seafood person. Whatever you're taste, they have a lot of options. 
The kids had pancakes. As far as pancakes go, these were way above average. And they serve them with authentic Canadian maple syrup. They just seem healthier. Once again, the portions are huge. Four pancakes per order. They could have split one order. We took four home with us. 
This review wouldn't be complete without a bow to Louka. What a sweetheart. She was so nice, friendly, and helpful; especially with our bits of \"trying\" French.  Merci Louka!"}
{"text":"Excellent brunch! This place is a dream for brunch lovers. The diverse menu has something to offer to every taste, ranging from conservative to more original dishes. My favorite was the \"indecisive\" option, where you get to choose from different savory and sweet options to build the perfect plate for yourself. 
I had high expectations coming to L'avenue's new location, and I was not disappointed. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is modern yet laid-back. Even on a Tuesday morning the place was vibrant and the staff was energetic and timely. The presentation of the dishes was simple but appealing. I really enjoyed their cretons and the mac and cheese pancakes which were the sweet option that I chose (although they were more savory than sweet...). The oreo milkshake was just perfect, not too sweet, but it should definitely be shared as it is pretty huge. Most of the meals were very filling and I felt like the staff was used to preparing leftover boxes. 
Don't forget to visit the restrooms in this location! Each one has a unique and hypnotizing setup. 
Overall a perfect brunch!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin??? This is by far the best brunch/lunch place in the city. I would actually move in if they would let me so I wouldn't have to wait in line. The lines are long.....but soooo worth it. The food is mind-boggling delicious. I'm not a true believer in magic but I kind of feel the kitchen is full of witches and wizards using spells to create foods that bewitch my taste buds.......you think I'm exaggerating?? go try it for yourself. Forget the food, my bowl of latte was the best I've ever had, I asked the waiter what was inside and he just smiled and wouldn't give me a straight answer. Everything that either came to our table or passed us by on the way to another table looked incredible. They give nice sized portions and good service. I had the Caramelized Banana French toast with Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, Italian Nutella and coconut.....who even thinks of putting all these amazing flavors together in one awesome dish?? Witches and wizards, that's who......see what I did there, came full circle on that one.  I like the fact that they've done a great job appealing to everyone....they even have several gluten free options. One of my friends ordered a gluten free eggs Benedict that was outstanding. We had alot of food.....the pancakes were great, the Reeses milkshake was to die for (although it didn't come to that fortunately), MTL bagels, homemade sausage, crispy bacon and all for about $70. When you consider how amazing everything was and the absurd amount of food we had for just 3 people, it was very reasonably priced. I sincerely hope they open one in the Westmount/NDG region........they'd be packed. Try this place, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"L'endroit parfait pour un brunch ou déjeuner ! Je dirais même bien que c'est mon number one ! Je me suis régaléééee ! En plus, les quantités sont plus que généreuses ! C'est un vrai brunch de champion ! Le frappé, j'ai pris le Choco-banane, oh mon dieu c'était énooorme mais meilleur frappé de ma vie ! (Et oui je l'ai fini, je n'ai pas laissé une goutte) 

Le décor quant à lui est atypique avec ses murs tagués et une moto suspendue au mur avec un squelette vêtu d' une veste en cuir (ça m'a directement fait penser au film Ghost Rider) et avec tout ça, musique Rock 'n' Roll bien évidemment ! J'aime beaucoup et l'endroit met de bonne humeur ! 

Quand j' y suis allée, heureusement pour nous, on n' a pas du faire la file mais les weekends, la file fait une bonne partie du trottoir donc arrivez tôt sinon vous risquez de renoncer tellement il y a du monde. 

Les serveurs sont hypers sympas, souriants, accueillants! 

Oh oui, j'ai failli oublier mais rendez visite aux toilettes, elles valent le détour ! 

Sur ce, le Restaurant l'Avenue fait maintenant partie de mes incontournables et fera sans doutes bientôt partie des vôtres ! 

Enjoyy '"}
{"text":"Although there was a huge line, we waited because we heard a lot about this place! It was in August therefore the weather was good to wait literally 40 minutes in the line. 

The decor and wall paints are amazing! The ambiance is really cool and you really enjoy the time you spend in this cafe! The most important part about this cafe is the restroom. Even if you don't have to pee, you need to stand in the line to get into it! It is really really cool with graffitis all over the walls with florescent lights give you delusion! Do not get high before going to the bathroom though! ;) 

The Nutella french toast with caramelized bananas I ordered was tooooo sweet! I could not even finish it because of the amount of sweetness! The steak Benedict was yummy ! 

I do recommend this place for anyone who comes to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Reasonable value-for-money portions. The experience was perhaps worth the 1 hour wait, but I'm not sure I would do it again. Don't forget to check out their bathroom, that's half of the experience!"}
{"text":"Had brunch today, heavenly. Better to come before 10am to avoid the long wait outside. Great brunch."}
{"text":"Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  And yes, it does deserve that many w's.

The waitress always smiled and offered coffee refills.  She will speak English to you even though the menu is all French (guess those two years of university French really helped here!  I got A's btw.).

I shared the eggs benedict with chorizo.  $15.95 plus a $1 sharing fee.  You will get one of the eggs, one small pot of roasted and seasoned potatoes, one large stick of fruit per person.  Totally worth the splitting fee because I was still stuffed 6 hours later.

AMAZING.  Holy cow.  I don't even like egg yolks that much but when this spills and mixes with your hollandaise, chorizo and egg whites while soaking into your English muffin halve, it is like heaven on earth.  Makes me hungry just thinking about this place.  Since I'm an out-of-towner, I'll have to try and imitate this to the best of my ability at home.  I probably won't succeed and will have to fly up here every Sunday.  Darn. ;)"}
{"text":"I believe we were told this is one of the busiest places in montreal and it most definitely was. We arrived close to 9am on a monday and the place was full lucky for us not completely and we were able to get a table. By the time we left an hour or so later the line was around the block and this was on a monday so if you do go.... GO EARLY!

Food was good hollandaise sauce was really great had the eggs benedict with crabcake. 

Will come back again on my next trip."}
{"text":"Amazing food that was well worth the wait. Service was friendly and the art on the walls is amazing. Get the pecan French toast!"}
{"text":"Un gros shout out à L'Avenue pour leur succès. Certes, leur brunch est bon, mais en vaut-il vraiment la peine pour près d'une heure d'attente? Bof. Eille la gang (vous qui me lisez): il y a une multitude de bons restaurants de brunch à proximité dans le Mile End au pire. 

J'ai eu le malheur une couple de fois d'être assise devant. La fenêtre me donnait donc une vue sur cette armée d'individus affamés (et congelés lorsqu'il s'agit d'une journée d'hiver). Le résultat? Manger avec anxiété et rapidité pour aider ces jeunes gens qui meurent d'envie de manger ou de prendre une selfie dans la toilette funky.

À cause de ce fameux traumatisme, je recommande plutôt d'aller à L'Avenue en semaine afin d'éviter cette file interminable. Mon déjeuné pref sont les ufs bénédictines \"Coin-Coin\" au confit de canard. Puis tant qu'à avoir attendu aussi longtemps en ligne, j'me gâte toujours avec un milkshake (ils sont vraiment bons)."}
{"text":"Writing this on behalf of my boyfriend and one close friend:
This is the worst brunch!
First, you have to wait for a LONG time to get in. 
After this long, you would expect their food to be good. 
But NOOOOOO, their food did not taste good at all, they said they could barely finish them.
Both of them won't consider ever go there again. 

One last comment, sometimes, restaurants with good yelp reviews just don't taste as good. Don't have high expectations!"}
{"text":"This place was SO COOL. Everything about it, the decor, the menu, the service, everything exceeded our expectations. We had a large party of 14 girls on a Saturday for my bachelorette party. Some girls went earlier in the morning to stand in the line and get our name in, which is highly recommended. They waited about 45 minutes and by the time the rest of the group got there, we were ready to be seated. It was insane as there was continuously a line outside, so make sure to get there early.

The menu had everything you can imagine - from food to drinks. We ordered a lot and sampled each others. I personally got the huevos rancheros which were good, but I do have to admit, it is more of a breakfast burrito than huevos rancheros and that was unexpected. Every drink ordered from the chai latte, to the almond latte, to the bloody Cesar to the green smoothie was so delicious too. Each meal even came with the freshest fruit appetizer! 

To top off our great experience, the staff was so friendly and accommodating and the bathroom was a very cool site to see. The location is also great, as after brunch we walked a bit to Mont Royal for a hike. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Worth the wait! I had the french toast with captain morgan sauce, bananas and chocolate! Oh boy!"}
{"text":"I came to L'avenue for brunch on Sunday. Luckily I beat the crowd and got there pretty early - but I still had to wait as they were accommodating larger parties. One of the waiters realized I had been waiting a really long time and seated me immediately. Because of the long wait he ended up giving me extra drinks and side orders - which was really sweet oh him. 

The egg benedicts were probably the BEST I've ever had and the coffee was a great match to the egg benedicts. The ambiance of this place is so cool!! I totally recommend this place if you're craving some good brunch."}
{"text":"I'm so happy we found this place on our trip to Montreal, it was the best brunch I've ever had.  Unless you get there early expect to wait at least an hour to get in but it is worth the wait.  The servers are super nice, the place looks awesome and its one of the few places where the bathrooms are worthy of a selfie."}
{"text":"Easily the best breakfast I had while in Canada. Totally worth the wait. You will most likely have to wait, so prepare to go before you are starving. I would recommend getting the duck eggs Benedict, it was delicious. Very tender and moist duck with caramelized onions. Also the pecan pie French toast is fantastic. The portions are big so go hungry. Finally, the potatoes are seasoned perfectly!"}
{"text":"All is said, I won't add much. Best 10,000-calory Benedictine breakfast ever! I am very much into making Benedictine Eggs at home, but I simply can not reproduce this one. The DJs are very cool as well. Positive vibe coming from every corner. Waited outside in -28 (-32 real feel) temperature for half an hour to get in, but it was totally worth it. Don't miss this one if you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Line up when we arrived but went quickly. Loved the watermelon infused water. Fruit starter was nice touch. Food was very good, very large portions. Staff extremely friendly and atmosphere lively. Great spot will be back again. .possibly tomorrow.  Lol"}
{"text":"Voilà une adresse que vous devriez garder dans un coin de votre mémoire! Une déco psychédélique, une ambiance festive et une bouffe excellente! C'est à peu près tout ce que vous devez en savoir... Mais allez, je vais quand même vous donner quelques conseils : testez absolument le Mojito à la framboise (au pichet c'est plus sympa), les hambourgeois, et le brunch. Attention, si vous prenez un club sandwich, sachez que c'est TRÈS généreusement servi (petits appétits s'abstenir!). Et si vous y allez un samedi soir ou un dimanche matin, ne faites pas l'erreur de penser que vous serez seuls! Quelque soit le temps, c'est sûr, il y aura foule!
Seul point négatif, la musique qui est vraiment très forte. Alors, ok ça fait partie du charme de l'endroit, de l'ambiance branché, tout ça, mais aller au resto et rien entendre de ce que vous disent les gens avec qui vous êtes, c'est un peu moyen non?"}
{"text":"I and my better half visited the great country of Canada and one of the many food spots on our list was L'Avenue. They were rated as the #1 brunch spot on everyone's list. If I could I would honestly rate them high above the Yelper score. I would easily give them 10 stars for the quality and portions alone.  When we arrived there was a line extending from the front of the restaurant to the next street over. Everyone was in line waiting patiently from the locals to the tourist you could easily see it was a normal process to enter this establishment. It was like the Willie Wonka Chocolate factory of brunches. Once inside you were given a menu and greeted professionally and sincerely by a hostess. We first heard of this bistro while watching the television series \"You Gotta Eat Here\" Our mission while in Canada was simple the plan was  to locate our restaurants and eat our way to the next target.  My wife said in California she enjoyed the best huevos - rancheros and after ordering it here she has recanted that statement. This one by far, hands down was the best one she ever had. I had eggs and pancakes with the fruit topping and orange juice. When it arrived it was more than I could ever imagine. The eggs were orange form freshness and the taste was beyond unimaginable. The bagel was amazing and the juice was super fresh. After devouring these plates we clearly identified to each other that this was one of the best brunches ever.  This place was everything and more. We would give them 10 stars easily. From the greeter to the server this place was incredible. If you're ever in Montreal, Canada \"You Gotta Eat Here\""}
{"text":"Après quelques années sans mettre les pieds à L'Avenue, j'ai décidé d'y aller avec maman et bébé. Nous sommes arrivées vers 14:00 après un peu de magasinage. En regardant autour de moi je me suis dit \"Ouin, j'ai vieilli....\" La clientèle est hyper jeune. Elle est venue prendre le déjeuner (ou plutôt le brunch à cette heure) après une longue nuit et une grasse matinée, UN LUNDI!!! Ah la jeunesse sans soucis. Enfin... c'est clair que ce n'est pas un restaurant baby-friendly, je sentais que je dérangeais les autres clients. Oh well... Je ne m'empêcherai pas de sortir. Alors, le service était toujours aussi long, mais pardonnable étant donnée la gentillesse du serveur. J'ai commandé ma fameuse bavette, contrairement au reste de la clientèle j'en étais déjà à mon deuxième repas de la journée. Bah.. il me semble qu'elle n'était pas aussi bonne que les autres fois ou peut-être que mes goûts culinaires du temps étaient moins raffinés. Maman a commandé des pâtes tagliatelles au poulet marsala, elle a adoré. Prochain rendez-vous pour le brunch!"}
{"text":"Came here for our last breakfast with the family before leaving Montreal. The atmosphere was cool and fun. The service was friendly and attentive. My husband and I ordered the eggs benedicts. Mine was the goat cheese, spinach and mushrooms version. Best benedict I have ever had. We loved the fruit kabob we were given before our food was served. Got to try some new fruits. My 3 kids loved their meals as well. Would definitely come back if in the area. Also my daughters thought the bathrooms were super cool. Very artsy and fun."}
{"text":"Man this place is amazing , I always take my friends to here when they come to montreal to visit , coolest wc too plus my favourite dish is bobey does Dallas if I am not mistaken the name , the meat and potato with the bbq sauce  in this dish and egg on top is so dammmmm Goood and the french toast and pancake omg , smoothies !! Everything in this place is perfect but just the menu is not good for everyone since they only have it in french ! I wish they would add english to it too !"}
{"text":"I thought I would try this classic Montreal brunch place and I did the one hour wait in line. Maybe I came with high expectations but my friends and I found the food good but honestly not life changing. Service was timely and waiters nice though! Prices are around 12$-18$ for a more complicated item and less for only eggs. I personally wouldn't come back again and go through the wait. Decent, nothing special brunch in my opinion! As mentioned before, check out the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"This placed USED to be awesome.  I used to never miss stopping here when I was in Montreal.  But the past 3 times I had it, it got progressively worst and has become somewhat of a tourist trap.  Last time, the eggs benedict came and the egg was fully cooked (fully!).  When I complained, they just brought a egg on a side plate separately and didn't even bother to put it on my dish.  The potatoes that came on the side were tasteless.  The fruit skewer tasted like it was sitting around for a long time before being served.  This place is living on its reputation now and not on quality.  What a shame."}
{"text":"my fam and i waited for this poppin brunch for an hour since 11am. the food turned out to be pretty worth the wait. we got:

1. salmon egg benedict
2. bobby does dallas - quite amazing bbq sauce on some beef, onions, and mushrooms with egg/cheese on top
3. french toast with the standard blueberries/strawberries/bananas but un-ordinary dressing and THIC TOASTS. ask for the maple syrup for an even sweeter experience.
4. some fruity smoothie drinks - get the mango pineapple!
5. coffee....mmm, always good in black.

all of this came out to be around $75"}
{"text":"Long line but worth the wait makw sure to come early the line goes down the block. It rained while i was there in line and they handed out umbrellas.They really think about their customers."}
{"text":"Was there about a month ago on a week day morning. So many things to love about this place! Hilarious menu copies (kudos to the creative copywriter).  The large water container filled with luscious watermelon where our waters came from...there is something super satisfying about looking at that water container.  Cool decor and feels very inclusive. The food was great! The best part was... all the waitress there were SUPER professional, friendly, efficient and they carry themselves so well! Elegant, approachable, well-mannered.  Special shout out to Noemie (I think that's her name), she was our waitress, she was just SUPER!   I got the feeling the management really did a great job finding perfect staff. 10 out of 10!! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is so good I became physically ill after shoveling all of the food down my gullet. Come here. You will not be disappointed. The reviews are not lying. I got the classic eggs Benedict with the coconut milk/maple syrup coffee. I'm actually writing this from the afterlife. I'm dead."}
{"text":"My first time trying and it was a great experience. I went on the weekend and there was a line up but it will be worth it. I got the indecisive. My favorites are the potatoes ( so flavourful) and the carrot pancake. Love the decor and when you go to the bathroom it feels like you're in a club. Oh and the service was spot on. Loved it !"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Coolest place to eat in Montreal. Even their bathroom was insanely cool, playing tricks on you when you enter. This breakfast lunch spot is a combination of a hip lounge and urban diner. It's crazy busy in there, but the staff is on top of things. Our server was fantastic and the kitchen did an equally excellent job quickly cranking out our indulgent meals. 

Loved the carrot cake pancakes, the banana Nutella with rum sauce pancakes were out of this world, poached free range eggs poured yolk when pierced, potatoes tasty - not one complaint. The smoothies looked like giant frozen cocktails, but they were healthy mixtures. They are extremely generous with the portions and even with their fruit, providing everyone with a healthy fruit kabob to start. 

There was a line late morning on a Tuesday, so I would imagine weekends are at least doubly long. Believe the hype, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wow. Best Eggs Benedict I have ever had (I should mention that Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast dish of all time). 

My gf got the pancakes and they were perfectly fluffy. They were spectacular. 

The food was great, service was a little slow and there was a wait... honestly, totally worth it."}
{"text":"People literally wait an hour in line here! We were shocked at the lineup but the food was really good, the drinks were very well done and the service was quick and attentive.  The back area with the windows wide open is really nice.  You get a ton of food too!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the best breakfast of my life. I have eaten in some great places but this was the most incredible Eggs Benedict I've had. They used a pulled pork instead of ham, the hollandaise sauce was perfect, the eggs equally perfect. But those potatoes - roasted somehow and just incredible. But it wasn't just my breakie, it was the skewer of fresh fruit that everyone got, the giant smoothies thy were all so delicious, his awesome the staff and ambiance were all just great.

Montreal has some real gems but for breakfast this is by far the best place I've ever been to. Oh - and the prices are competitive with any chain restaurant but you're eating some of the best Montreal has to offer. There is always a line up and it was packed from the second we got there to the moment we left but now I know why."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!
I'll keep this short. Come here while not hungover. I went to a bachelor party and had to go to the bathroom. Needless to say, it was as if I had an acid trip.
Fun restaurant with great food."}
{"text":"Mon premier brunch à Montréal. Attendre 2h30 pour une table et pour ce qu'il y a dans l'assiette, c'est un crime. C'était très bon, bien que très lourd aussi. C'est différent des brunchs français, donc pour une première fois, j'étais un peu surprise. Personnel était sympa bien que très occupé. Large choix de plats, aussi des ufs ou des gaufres...il y en a pour tous les goûts."}
{"text":"I can see why everyone says to come here for brunch, they have an amazingly long eggs benedict menu, so many things to try! We got here kind of late in the day, on a weekday at that and it was still pretty busy!

For some reason, I just wanted the regular plain old eggs benny, got made fun of for it and happy that I got it. I think I just wanted to try the original first and next time I go I will try something new. It was delicious, seriously. The sauce was one of the best I've had. Also, the potatoes.....DON'T SKIP THEM, they have an amazing herb mixture on them that is just lovely.

The decor is also funky and fun, and ps....GO TO THE BATHROOM!"}
{"text":"A MUST VISIT....

Was on a short trip to Montreal, and one of my friends recommended this place, and was like you haven't been to Montreal if you haven't been there. So i took his advise and went... And boy was he right, it was worth every minute we stood in line waiting for a table, we were in queue at about 11:00AM and were seated at 12:00PM. The place was very busy, the waiters seemed overwhelmed at the start but caught up with time and was able to serve us in a proper and decent manner... 

Two things that stood out, one amazing and one not so amazing:
1) NOT so amazing: the menu is ONLY in french. Special thanks to a nearby Italian costumer who helped us decode the menu.
2) Amazing: their BATHROOM, is a MUST VISIT :) :)"}
{"text":"The food is great and the atmosphere is intimate. Eggs Benedict and the potatoes were quite good!"}
{"text":"Went to the one on St Denis. I had a great experience when I went last summer but a terrible one when I went in February. We ordered the Eggs Benedictine Evidente and 3 Viandes. The potatoes were undersalted, the bacon was burned, the food lacked flavor and tasted rubbery. The waitress was completely indifferent. I was very disappointed, especially since I've read so many good reviews of this place and I'm not sure if I went at an unusual time - 4pm - or because it was winter. Will NOT be going again or recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"Super délicieux et service vraiment excellent Nous allons y retourner
Parfait pour party de Noël"}
{"text":"I admit that I was cynical.

In a town full of spectacular restaurants, how could this one be known to the masses as the best breakfast joint on the island?   It was impossible.

I mean, didn't someone ever have a bad experience here?

We got there around 930am on a Monday.  No lineup.  

Seated quickly.   Attentive service.  Massive choice.

I orderted the Huevos Rancheros.  I've never had better.

Damn you popular opinion.

You win everytime."}
{"text":"Just finished a pretty tasty breakfast here based on recommendations from Yelp reviews. Overall a good experience and one I would recommend in the area. 

I got the Gym Dude omelet, but I subbed goat cheese for Swiss cheese, which I also recommend. Overall a great dish. My one complaint was that the chicken inside the omelet was a bit flavorless. I would have preferred the chicken to be seasoned rather than just boiled. I think that would have upped it to a 5. Got a beautiful fruit skewer to start the meal too! 

We also had the indecisive plate and tried the mac n cheese pancake with BBQ sauce - very southern flavor. 

Overall a decent place with friendly staff. Quarters are tight - plan to sit very close to your neighbors!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. I was visiting Montreal and decided to come here for brunch one morning. Prices are reasonable. Food is delicious. And they carry my favorite brand of coffee. This is definitely a must try when visiting Montreal. I was not disappointed. If you are going to come here for brunch, make sure you get here early. I was fortunate enough to come just as they were opening and there was already a line outside. I was seated immediately but by the time that I was done, the line outside was relatively long. So worth it though."}
{"text":"As soon as you are seated, you get a fruit skewer and water that has been infused with watermelon. (I'd honestly go back just for that water) The atmosphere of the restaurant is trendy; their bathroom is glow in the dark! They have an extremely diverse menu, however I don't understand French and they didn't have English menus so my friend helped translate it. I ended up ordering the plate with everything on it. Their portions are HUGE and I felt slightly nauseous after eating so much. Their food is good; I still dream about those pancakes. However I felt like it was just too greasy and heavy of a meal, especially for breakfast.
Will definitely return, maybe once I finish digesting that first meal."}
{"text":"Benedicts, omelettes and pancakes. Very good address with a nice vibe and original interior. Portions are really generous relatively to the prices. Gets busy on the weekend, expect 20-30 minutes of line up."}
{"text":"One goal:  To eat their Eggs Benedict !      We have been there twice and the first time we did not try the Eggs Benedict, while we saw them being delivered to every table around us....this time, we decided to go for it...  I got the smoked salmon one, my BF got the classic.   Both were excellent !    They come with delicious fresh fruit and home fries.  

I got the sauce on the side and that was perfect for me, so I could meter the amount of sauce on my dish....but a taste of the Hollandaise sauce tells me, that is one of the best ones I've ever had.    

We got there on a Sunday around 8:45 and we waited about 45 minutes to get a table.   It's easiest to get a quick table if there's 2 or 4 in your party.  Large parties of 6+ sometimes have to wait over 1-1:30 hours to get a table since the space is small.  

Try it out if you are in the area.   Worth it !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"LOVED it here!! We heard the lines could be long so we came early on a Sunday. We waited for about 30 minutes but there was a street market going on so we had plenty to keep us occupied. The food was so EXTRA! Yum! Service was so-so but it didn't even matter because the decor and food was so on point. Looking forward to our next trip!"}
{"text":"Mimosa pitchers - while a little pricy at $45 are worth every penny! Freshly squeezed OJ and fruity champagne - we got 2!

The eggs benedict was probably the best I have ever had, the eggs were cooked perfectly - so often they are not.

Our server was also a delight, funny and witty. The manager even came over to assist us with tourist suggestions.

I don't know how it happened, but we managed to walk right in and snag a table without a wait during brunch on a weekend!

Don't go to Montreal without going here."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place so many times and always wished to go there. My friends finally had the time and we decided to go here for brunch. We saw the line and almost was giving up, but we actually only waited 15 min which isnt that bad for that line! 

Once we get in you first notice their decoration, and then the loud music. It's not the best place for people who are looking for a quiet brunch place, as it could feel like you are in a club. But the food is amazing! They serve you fruits once you sit which I think is everyone's wish: to have food right away!

Also, my friends kept saying I should go to the restroom, cause \"its an experience\". I had no idea why they were saying that till I actually went. I won't spoil it, but just saying if you go there, go to the restroom as well..

Would definetely recommend here, nice food, good for chilling with friends, and you get the \"restroom experience\""}
{"text":"Very good eggs benedict, but they cannot for their lives cook sunny-side up or over-easy/medium/hard eggs.

I've never had a waiter argue so fervently that over-medium eggs should have uncooked whites! Good grief."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch places in Montreal, highly recommended. Our waitress was very helpful and recommended the Nutella drink, which is amazing. The food was well worth the price and portions. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch here thanks to the recommendation of a friend - they were right - well worth the wait. Not only was the food good, but the music played was really good.

The only warning I'll give is to all the meat lovers out there - the steak and eggs is more like eggs with cheese steak - thin cut strips cooked that way - so it's not like you're getting real steak. Other than that, it's brilliant."}
{"text":"The food is good. The options are great for tasting many different things in one plate  but the service sucks.

First place I went to when I arrived to Montreal for a weekend vacation. I was traveling alone that day because my friend was arriving the day after. I stood on line like everyone else and even though I was next I got  skipped a few times until I said something to the person seating people . Their response was there was no seats available for one person. So I tried not to get annoyed thinking they were seating me by the bar but not there is no bar and the minimum amount of seats is for two. I was so angry. If it wasn't for the food being decent I would have rated this place a 1 star . With all this said, go to Regine Cafe -Brunch it's so much better go for the croissant sandwich with a side of scotch egg. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"30 minute wait was well worth it! This restaurant serves up the most delicious and best waffles, Eggs Benedicts, house potatoes, and more. My Blueberry Basil Mimosa was absolutely amazing! Love, love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really trippy toilets, really trippy staff, very trippy experience.
Food is goodish, drinks are alrightish."}
{"text":"Si vous aimez les grosses assiette, les gros smoothies et les twists sucrées, l'Avenue est pour vous ! Dans une ambiance pop-rétro-urbaine, l'Avenue propose un service rapide et chaleureux . Les portions sont très grosses, la nourriture est bonne et bien originale. Petit point négatif : il y a souvent une grosse file d'attente pour entrer, et le restaurant est toujours plein; on manque un peu d'espace. Parfait pour les touristes qui visitent le plateau ! Mais bon, il y a toujours des endroits un peu plus typiques ..."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place! Every time I visit Montreal I come here. I went with a group of 4. We ordered steak & eggs Benny, mushroom & lardon, and gym dude omelette. All the eggs Benny were fantastic. The mushroom & Lardon is still my favorite. The gym dude omelette was gigantic! But taste wise it was just a regular omelette. 

Their bathroom is so cool! Come early for weekday brunch to avoid the massive lines. Come before 10."}
{"text":"US California customer review here !

Great spot for breakfast! My wife and I came here before taking a trip to Mount Royal. 

Their breakfast menu is pretty darn big. Full range of choices for whatever floats your boat. They have free range eggs here and gluten free options. 

Big plus... There are lots of choices for egg benedict's here. We are both egg benedict fans. 

Wife got the mushroom benedict and she was happy with it. 

I ordered the classic. It was good but it had an extremely intense ham taste. It was a little too sweet for my taste buds. I wouldn't order it again. 

It has friendly service and the decor is hippyish. I would definitely return to try out other items."}
{"text":"Favorite brunch place in Montreal, hands down. There's usually a line up though, so I recommend going at off-peak hours. The portions are huge, which is great to brunch. It's also very fairly priced for the amount of food you get. Their carrot cake pancakes are amazing. Sometimes the service can be slow, but when you go to a super busy place, that's expected."}
{"text":"C'est dommage d'attendre aussi longtemps. Mais une fois à table, ça va vite. C'est très bon, des portions généreuses mais attention si vous n'avez pas l'habitude de manger aussi riche, la digestion peut être difficile."}
{"text":"Toujours étonnée de voir un si grand engouement pour ce restaurant déjeuner et brunch.

C'est bien mais rien d'unique ni d'extraordinaire. Attendre 45 minutes et plus, non merci. Plusieurs autres endroits valent davantage le détour.

Pas un must."}
{"text":"Le cliché parfait du brunch qui fait plaisir. Tout y est : les ufs sous toutes les formes, les pancakes, les saucisses, les fruits ... bonheur"}
{"text":"AAAAAAaaaaaahhhhhhh-masing. Seriously, Amazing. 

I usually don't even like breakfast foods. My husband lives for breakfast and always has to drag me along with him.

We had the most perfect breakfast ever. I think it is responsible for my conversion to finally appreciating the first meal of the day.

They sat us at a spacious but cozy booth. The music section was impeccable. Our adorable server was professional and efficient. (Three cheers for ambiance and service -woot woot!).

The coffee was rich, luscious perfection. 

Our plate had everything - pancakes (light, airy perfection), French Toast (literally the best I've ever had in my life - vanilla madness), potatoes, eggs, crispy bacon, homemade flavorful sausage, pulled pork deliciousness, cretons (my first experience, holy cow. Breakfast paté ), and heavenly baked beans, all served alongside an aluminum can of the world's best maple syrup, a fresh fruit skewer appetizer, and a perfect -PERFECT- baguette.

We live five hours away by car... and are considering a road trip just to relive this meal once again."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhmazing!! Is all I can say. Best salmon egg benedict I've ever had. They give you fruit to start with, which was very lovely and delicious! Great way to start the day. 

My friend and I were visiting Montréal from Massachusetts and we stumbled upon this place on Yelp. Saw the reviews and needed to go! Be aware that you will most likely wait in a line, but if you're with one or two people you can get in sooner. The menu is in all French (had to google translate some stuff) but the waitress helped us find what we wanted. 

My friend got the Idaho omelette and she said it was the most intricate omelette she ever had haha so many flavors and ingredients!! I got the salmon benedict and almost died. Literally. It was so good!! The hash browns are home made, too and they put some seasoning in it that will make you want more. 

This place is the spot for breakfast/brunch!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but it was a lot of food, be careful haha you better get the combo. The service is fast and the people nice."}
{"text":"Very long wait."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to go for breakfast or brunch in Montreal. Great atmosphere and incredible taste of food. Service was on point. You all have to visit this place!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, you're gonna queue up for overpriced eggs??"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time nearly ten years ago, and never forgot it... Couldn't believe you STILL line up, even on a random Wednesday morning. And I generally won't line up for much of anything :) 

More recently they've changed the menu up slightly (event the website isn't up to date yet), but still so, so, good. They used to have a Benedict with onion compote, but it's been replaced with one even better (some caramelized onion and mushroom nonsense). But literally everything is great, filling, and indulgent.

Coffee... Shakes... Smoothies... Whatever you're into. This place always seems to have something for anyone, and the service is lovely too. Couldn't recommend more highly."}
{"text":"I am not a breakfast person and I absolutely was not expecting a breath-taking experience. 

My friends and I are all very picky eaters and usually do not walk away from a meal completely satisfied. This is one of the few times we did. Everything - from the complimentary fruit they served at the start, to the amazing smoothies, to the meals - was perfect. 

We waited 40 minutes to get in around 12:30pm Saturday and I'm not even complaining. We asked people ahead of us in line if they had been there before and whether we should wait or not. Every single person told us that it's worth the wait 100% and I'm so glad we did. 

Definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying we were told there would be a 30 minute wait and it ended up being at least 45 minutes.  Who cares!  Everything from the decor to the service was above and beyond.  They had menus in English available to us.  First, we were served our water.  Not just any water, watermelon infused water.  Then they took our drink order.  Two of our party ordered coffee (I think that had free refills), one ordered one of the \"jus exotiques\", which turned out to be a giant margarita-sized orange, blueberry, raspberry smoothie, garnished with a strawberry and a mini umbrella, and I ordered a decaffeinated cappuccino (decaf coffee had to be made on a separate single serve espresso-based drink machine).  Everyone loved their drinks.  My cappuccino was served with a design in the foam and a little swiss chocolate on it's saucer (how darling, I'll take another!).  We were then served a fruit skewer.  All of us.  Not just people who ordered certain things--I hate that. 

For our entrees, I ordered the classic eggs benedict on gluten free toast.  The pulled pork they used in it was a little too sweet for me, but everything was made perfectly.  I noticed the scrambled eggs on my friend's plate and they were like textbook french culinary school perfectly cooked scrambled eggs.  I know it sounds silly, but I was very impressed by this.  Another friend of mine ordered french toast with Nutella and whipped cream.  That plate was serious.  It had the thickest slices of challah I've ever seen.  

The decor was awesome, including a hanging motorcycle, colorful globe-shaped lights, and a blacklight/graffiti art bathroom.  You seriously just need to see it for yourself.  Everyone at our table was more than satisfied with their experience at L'Avenue and it was definitely that, more than just brunch."}
{"text":"If the wait weren't so long this would be a five star review. 

The portions here are straight up enormous. My girlfriend and I came here twice over one weekend. The first time we ordered eggs Benedict and a bow of yogurt and granola, thinking that the yogurt would be small. Nope! It was 6 ginormous strawberries, trail mix, and a large bowl of yogurt. It was so big we couldn't even finish!

The next time we decided to split a single omelette. This was right on. The restaurant does add a charge for splitting but I don't think they decreased the portion size. Instead, we each got potatoes and a large omelette and it was so so delicious. It's also a cool vibe and friendly service but be ready for a long wait."}
{"text":"The food wasn't great.  It felt like a tourist trap...please keep searching and find something better to eat"}
{"text":"If you arrive before 11am, you have a better chance of not waiting in line. Even if you wait in line it is more than worth it. The staff, ambience, service and delicious food makes up for it. Every meal starts off with a skewer of fresh fruit. Juices are natural and fresh as well. Coffee is delicious. Would def recommend and will come back."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places I've been to for brunch! We had an amazing time here. The food and service is great and the drinks are just as great. Make sure to come and get a table because there was a line outside as we were in, even on a Thursday!"}
{"text":"Fantastic omelets and heavenly, fluffy pancakes. You can taste the love that gets put into making the food. I come to this place every time I visit Montreal. It is a lot of heavenly tasting food. There is always a line and sometimes the customer service lags behind but its definitely worth it."}
{"text":"A must. All that is good about Montreal. Nutty, engaging design. Friendly, quirky staff and a wide range of delicious options--smoothies, eggs Benedict in twelve versions...pages of choices. Fruit included with everything. All solid. Never said this in a review: don't miss the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"The best brunch I have ever had. Everyone talks about how amazing this place is and let me tell you, it's not just hype. It is to die for. I ate the eggs Benedict with caramelized onions,  4 year old aged cheddar and confit d'onignon. Every bite was better than the last.. Truly delicious. My boyfriend had the Huevos Rancheros which was absolutely excellent!! It was worth the long wait. Definitely something people should try."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have ever had, real talk. Great vibe, friendly staff, reasonably prices. If you are visiting Montréal this is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Absurdly good. Absurdly good. The sort of meal and food that makes you wish you had 3-4 stomachs, so that you could just eat everything on the menu. 
     On a recent trip here with my family we ate an epic multi course breakfast-brunch. I don't use the word epic lightly. There is the starter course, a fresh fruit spread for each person, with a bevy of different fruit selections. So fresh and so good, yet there is snow pouring down outside the window, surreal yes, but also delicious. 
     For our mains my mother and I opted for savory, I had a duck confit benedict. It was as amazing as it sounds. In fact, I would say it's the best benedict I've ever eaten. It was a sublime version of the dish. My mom had a simple breakfast with eggs, bacon, and a salad. But, all were excellent, and cooked/prepared perfectly. My brother's order was epic. He ordered both the carrot cake pancakes and the french toast. Both dishes again, were amazing. I usually don't go in for sweet breakfast, but these two dishes were perfect, not too sweet with just the right amount of syrup and whipped cream atop them. 
    Beyond the food there are the drinks- fresh juices and cocktails abound. Want an Irish coffee? They'll make you one better with a dose of maple in it. Want some beer? How about a 2 for 1 deal, yeah that's right I had two IPA's here for about $7. Can't get that sort of deal anywhere stateside, and at brunch no less. 
     And finally the service. This place was slammed the day we came, with a line down the block. But, you'd never know from how cool and collected the waitstaff are. Our server was near telepathic in regards to our table, not to mention that she was also incredibly beautiful. But it wasn't just her, everyone working here treated you as a special guest. It was just a great atmosphere to dine in, especially compared to brunch hotspots in places like NYC and PDX. 
     If you want amazing food, great service, all for a good price you must stop by here at L'Avenue. Good things will await you for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh man. Everything here was so delicious it's hard to describe. We found this restaurant here on Yelp prior to our road trip from the USA to Canada, and we are sure glad we found it.

I ordered a breakfast platter with eggs, French toast, hash browns and fruit (pictured) and literally everything on that plate was phenomenal. We also had hot chocolate which was served with whipped cream and a strawberry. My girlfriend ordered what was essentially a club sandwich but with a fried egg instead of chicken, and she also rates her dish with 5 stars. The service was great as well, and our server helped us translate the menu into English.

If you're visiting Montreal, this restaurant is an absolute must-visit for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"I can only describe Montreal as.... free spirited. It's a different kind of place. L'avenue pretty much embodies everything that is Montreal. It can be seen in the decor, the wait staff, and even translates to the food. 

If It's 8am and it's feels like You haven't eaten in days, l'avenue is here for you. What should I order you might ask. Although there are numerous ways you can go, to you I say....the Benedict! This is absolute indulgence. The duck confit in particular is perfectly executed. 

Pro's
-portion size: very much deceiving. I almost requested a wheel barrel to wheel me out. 
-service: my food came out in 5 minutes flat. Beat that! 
-menu: sooooo many options

Cons
honestly I'm not sure I can think of any...."}
{"text":"Love l'avenue! I rarely go though because of the courage it takes to brave the line outside for the winter. 

The service is quick and friendly - though by the end of the meal you know they're trying to turn the table since there are hungry crowds to feed. 

The portions are humongous and the menu is so long you'll get confused trying to decide what to order. It's not a bad kind of confusion thankfully. 

I would recommend being savvy and splitting an omlette or giant breakfast plate and then ordering a smoothie or any of their giant drinks."}
{"text":"L'Avenue after 7 years is still my go to spot for brunch, this is a MUST try for anyone in Montreal, a word of advice, be prepared to wait! They have two locations but I've only been to the one in Plateau-Mont-Royal.

Advice - get there early, 9 or 10am, try the steak & egss benedict!"}
{"text":"L'Avenue always has a line-up outside their door, and I'm not surprised considering how good their brunch is. The menu is extensive and creative, ranging from mac and cheese pancakes to lobster sandwiches. The portions are huge and the drinks are too. The bathroom is one of the coolest in the plateau, and the same goes for the interior decor. We always find ourselves back here for brunch every year. It is one of those classic Montreal places that we always recommend to family and friends. :)"}
{"text":"This place is completely awesome, and well worth any weight you WILL have. The food is all as unique as it is delicious! Keep your friends at home, because when you come in pairs here you get seated more quickly."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday, I already knew the place on Mont-Royal, and it is the same. Same menu, decor and service. Nice menu I really enjoy their eggs Benedictine, especially the chorizo and the spinach/goat cheese, but if you like big brunch the\"bon ben j'me la prend toute\" is made for you. Everything is good, go over there for a nice brunch :)"}
{"text":"So conflicted about this place, highs and lows.

The food was 5-star. Complimentary fruit skewer was delicious, and the steak and eggs benedict was unbelievable. 

The service was really poor though.  The waitress, who seemed rather cold to all the tables (including those where the patrons spoke French), was especially abrupt and impatient with us (I don't speak French, and the menu is entirely in French). 

She completely forgot our drink order (which is fine, it happens).  But when she realized her mistake--she asked for drinks a second time and we reminded her that we had already ordered 10 minutes ago--she just let out an \"oh\" and walked away.  She pretended like she didn't hear me when I attempted to get her attention (she was 3 ft. away and definitely heard me). Overall, the service was a real downer, and I hope an anomaly!

Food was really great though. For real."}
{"text":"Yum, fun, sensory losing bathroom. Watermelon water and fruit to start your dining experience. And it's just that, an experience, highlighted by the highly tasty abundance of rich, indulgent foods and the friendly and stylish waitstaff."}
{"text":"Amazing! From the decor to the food this place is awesome, but the line outside will tip you off. Just go there; you won't be disappointed. 

The menu is french-only but easy to understand and the staff speak English.
The food is fresh and there are many healthy options."}
{"text":"We went with a party of five so we got to try a few dishes.  first off the menu had a huge selection of deliciously sounding dishes, but its only in french which wasn't a problem for us. 

nw the food,  the fruit skewer was not impressive,  fruits didnt taste so fresh.  the egg Benedict dishes were incredible.   the pancakes were equally delicious, perfectly fluffy and melt in your mouth. portion sizes are quite large.  

overall another great food experience in montreal.  i wish they would venture into Toronto."}
{"text":"Is this really one of the best breakfast spots in Montreal? I really wanted to find out.

I arrived at 9:15 AM and there was already a line/ 35 minute wait. Luckily, all the stores on Avenue du Mont Royal were putting on a massive sidewalk sale, so we checked that out for a bit while we waited.

I ordered two eggs with a choice of ham. It also comes with fruit and potatoes. I love that the fruit skewer they give you ain't the syrupy prepackaged stuff you get at most places. It's a legit skewer. Also the potatoes were fantastic. I couldn't stop shoveling them into my mouth even after my tummy said it was full. Egg and ham were good, as expected. For under 10 CAD, I was ultra stuffed--- this place is an amazing deal for breakfast! Service was also friendly but not intrusive.

My only con is that the tables are literally inches apart. You can 100% eavesdrop on your dining neighbors' conversations even if you don't want to. Need to use the restroom? You'll need to be exactly 3 inches wide in order to squeeze past the tables.

Now onto the restrooms...a general rule of mine is to never bring my phone to the bathroom (e-coli y'all) but this was the one exception. I just had to document the neon graffiti! The restroom had a tough, urban vibe without the worry of stepping on used needles or discarded spoons. I was bummed that they didn't have the peeper clock turned on though (I checked both stalls).

Overall, I'd say it's worth it to check out L'Avenue for the fruit skewers, potatoes, and their vibes and friendly service."}
{"text":"Large portions and friendly, but a little slow service."}
{"text":"Its a fun and unique place you must try. The dishes are humongous and diverse! Great place for hangover brunch. Only downside is its popularity, ie the wait in line"}
{"text":"Pros: great food, huge portions, clean, good coffee

Cons: service was slow, extremely crowded tables."}
{"text":"L'Avenue in Notre Dame, is everything the original is but without the long waits. Great food and very professional and friendly wait staff. Finally found my permanent breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Food was good, but kinda pricey--as is a lot of the restaurants in Montreal, however. 

Presentation was very good and I like how they gave us free fruit for every dish ordered.

Service was very very good. They obviously knew what they were doing. 

I also really like how hip the decoration in this restaurant is. The bathroom is really cool and interesting."}
{"text":"BEST FRENCH TOAST. it's all about the details. Bottomless PURE maple syrup (that's my kind of Montreal).  Pink Himalayan rock salt. (Still waiting for pepper mills...) Most refreshing table water infused with watermelons. Avoid the weekend brunch lineups before 9:45am. They do offer complimentary coffee for your sidewalk wait."}
{"text":"The line up here is about a 45 minutes. The atmosphere is nice as well as the staff. I had the duck benny, mouth watering. I also had the watermelon mimosa, it wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be. Try the mojito out it's refreshing and the large size you get a litre :)"}
{"text":"I found this place based upon the reviews on Yelp.  When we walked up, there was a line, which is always a good sign.  The wait was about 20 minutes but well worth it.  The ambiance of this place is what I would describe as eclectic fun!  The bathrooms are a must to go into regardless of whether you need to use them or not.  The walls are covered with random graffiti like artwork and the lighting is such that everything glows on the walls, as well as your clothing and such.  I so wish I had brought my cell phone in with me just to take a pic!  Anyway, back to the real reason to come to this restaurant, the food.  The menu is interesting so you nee to take a minute to settle on what you have a taste for.  I landed on The Goat which I had made with egg white omelets and a side of brown bread.  Kendal went for what was actually my first choice.  Un P'Tit Peu Moins S'a Cut.  Basically egg white omelet with small piece of chicken breast, onions and goat cheese which was accompanied by a small mixed green salad and she chose the brown bread as well.  Earlton had an eggs benedict dish.  Kendal and I started with hot cocoa, mine made with coconut milk.  Creamy, hot, and delicious!  The meals were excellent.  The portions were so large that Kendal and I took half of ours home and had for dinner that night.  Everything was freshly made, well seasoned and hot!  They served a lovely fruit skewer as a starter.  Each piece of fruit was sweet and fresh.  The service was excellent (attentive, helpful, prompt)!!  Would definitely go back when I return to Montreal and may not worry about whether there is any better breakfast/brunch place in town (smile)!"}
{"text":"Sunday night I couldn't sleep at all and no for particular reason. So at 4:45am when I just decided to get up and get breakfast at this place that is famous for its breakfast. Even the Prince and I couldn't get a spot on a Sunday without waiting for an hour and a half. The restaurant is called L'Avenue and in the window they have a mannequin dressed like a Forever 21 hooker with tattoos painted on. The best was the brass knuckles over a rose in the armpit. The worst, well actually it's a tie for the worst; there was the leopard print that took up all of her forearm and the Trophy Girl written over a big diamond on her stomach. Delightfully tacky.

The mimosas were pretty good, if you're not afraid of pulp, and they make them with rosé champagne (although I didn't verify if it was actually real champagne). I had the huevos rancheros which is my fave breakfast dish but I don't think that it did this place justice. Waaaaaay too much guacamole on top, which is a very frequent restaurant error. And I'm not used to having my cheddar sliced instead of shredded on top but that's just me. The meal was definitely of American proportions with a healthy serving of breakfast potatoes and a large portion of fresh fruit.

There's a poster at the entry with 3 male waiters in silver speedos advertising Mimosa Thursdays 2-for-1. The cutest of the trio, Jeff, ended up being my server, imagine that! And he really went out of the way so that I enjoyed myself. The place got really busy later on even though it was Monday. They don't have a website, so obviously word of mouth advertising is strong.

I'll definitely go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Literally amazing. 

Best brunch place around. Food was beyond exquisite and the staff was so chill. 

We came for my friend's birthday and they comped her meal because it was her special day! 

Every dish we ordered was well above excellent. We waited outside in line for 45 minutes and it was worth every minute waiting."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday with a couple friends while on vacation in Montreal. The wait is INSANE it took us over an hour to be seated but it truly was worth it. The food was incredibly delicious and rich. The french toast was super fluffy and the omelette was filled with cheese. Highly recommend the Nutella Latte! Also check out the bathrooms before you leave, they are very interesting!"}
{"text":"L'Avenue's menu is so overwhelming the finding what to eat can be enjoyable for some and disastrous for the indecisive. I chose to go with their \"Basic Omelette\" based on it's modest price of just short of $10. The Basic Omelette was exactly what its' name implies: basic and an omelette made of four eggs making it thick and impossible to finish. However, I must give L'Avenue credit for making absolutely phenomenal smoothies with kale, and other vegetables I don't remember that actually tasted great, and for the fruit they serve with maple syrup - Very Canadian! In short, while lacking in the basic omelette department, L'Avenue did not disappoint in all other aspects, (including service and decor) but make sure to get an interesting main dish if you can afford it and avoid my mistake."}
{"text":"Our group of 11 were visiting Montreal over the holiday break. We visited this restaurant for brunch and had to wait in line in -20c weather for 45 mins haha. Believe there was only one table large enough to handle a group which was already taken so we were seated separately and we were ok with that. Turned out the wait was well worth it. The menu was simply awesome with wholesome organic and non GMO ingredients combined in the usual classic favourite brunch dishes and fresh juices. Everyone starts with a skewer of fresh fruit which was a nice touch. The staff were smiling and joking in spite of the crowds and the perennial running around from one table to the other. Service was good. The washroom was interesting due the display of loud neon in darkness inside so definitely pay a visit :) Rest of the decor was very tastefully done. We are definitely coming back on our next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"This was our first visit.  We wondered why there was a line out the door and down the sidewalk.  Then we saw the food..."}
{"text":"Two hour wait....totally worth it. There were about 8 of us that were waiting in line for breakfast, but at the time we got in, it was basically lunch. So brunch. The decor is absolutely stunning for what Montreal is all about. Street art and graffiti was prominent everywhere, and yes I am talking about L'Avenue. The bathroom was literally graffiti with blacklight everywhere.

So the food. My god the food. Wait, lets start with drinks. So I ordered a hot chocolate to start, and it took a while to get to my table (besides the fact that it was super crowded). I asked the waitress and she said it was coming, so when it did, I was stunned. This isn't your Swiss Miss instant hot chocolate. This was decedent, delicious, and full on chocolate. My god I'd go back just for that. I also ordered a mango type of juice, and it was HUGE. They really don't skimp at L'Avenue. I shared it with the 4 people at my table because I couldn't finish it. 

So back to the food. I ordered an eggs benedict with the smoked meats, hollandaise and a side of potatoes.....get this. And only this. This was to die for, absolutely. It was like trying Montreal in one bite....every time. It was too good. We all got different things, ranging from sweet/savory french toast eggs benedict, to a little bit of everything (I'm not sure if that is what its called, but its ok).

So all in all I can't stress how good this place is! 2 hours was definitely worth the wait!!!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Met my friend for brunch on a colder Saturday morning, you can line up inside which is a definite plus and you don't feel like you're standing on people trying to eat. The decor is typical L'avenue style and it's on point. 

The food we ordered was a 50/50 we both got eggs Benedict, mine was really good.
(Asparagus green peppers, onion and mushroom all chopped up to make it easy to eat!)
My friend got the duck confié Benedict, he found bones in it which threw him off. 

We ordered filter coffees; not included with the breakfast but good coffee none the less, we also got two bloody ceasers, they used crushed ice so it melts too quickly, Also too much horseradish and smoothie straws. They were HUUUGE! I got an orange on my ceaser (weird?) but pickles thankfully came later :D they've got like 8 hot sauces they bring to the table upon request, so definite PLUS.

I believe our waiters name was Rolando, he was very nice,  friendly and attentive. Great vibes all around! 

VERY disappointed with ONLY French menus. 

I would have rated it three stars because they've got a few kinks to work out however I went with four because it was an over all good experience. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The decor is super retro and always fun to look at. Very hipster-ish! The food's delicious, we ordered the breakfast poutine and the Dallas skillet. The bbq sauce in the Dallas was very sweet and a little over powering but delicious none the less and the poutine fries are these huge wedges that are super yummy, the hollandaise sauce claims to be spicy but it's not at all, but it's really good! 
Our waitress was very nice, not over attentive but did switch to English the moment we spoke English and gave us good service. (She had long dark hair, darker skin and a few facial piercings, I never caught her name :-/ ) I've been here numerous times and that rarely happens, So was definitely a plus for us! The mimosa's are nice and boozy!  


Lastly the bathroom is worth a check out!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this because of all the great reviews but upon sitting down I thought it was just like any other trendy brunch spot.  It's a great space and thoughtfully designed. Graffiti wall, cool colorful lights, suspenders and bow tie clad servers, garage door that open up the back terrace area.  However, the menu did not look like anything special other than two, YES, TWO, full pages of cocktails. Good looking out for the boozy bunch!  Thanks and cheers!

It took me a while to decide on food because it all sounded the same. I let my server's recommendations narrow my selections and ordered the Duck Benedict and a coconut maple coffee concoction. The coffee was great. I had never heard of it before so of course I had to try it. Now, the duck...omg...that was good. The English muffin was a little tough, not sure why I had such a difficult time cutting through it but after a while I was getting so full; there wasn't any more room left for bread so whatever.  The poached eggs we perfect. The duck was tasty. The potatoes...man, you know a place is legit when something as simple as potatoes are spot on delicious!

The service was excellent!  I did not get my servers name but she was so awesome.  I'm so glad a Yelper mentioned that she liked this location better than Mont Royal. She was not lying. It's fantastic. I suppose I cannot compare since I've never been to the other location but I've passed by several times and there was ALWAYS a long line. I'm not standing in any line when there is amazing food all over this city.  Anyway, back to my amazing server...she was delightful. Warm, charming, checked in with me at appropriate times, totally girl crushing on her!  Even the manager stopped by to check on how everything was.

As if that wasn't enough...the surprises never end. Ok, so if you happen to be here and you are completely hungover or high I suggest not using their restrooms without assistance. You will not be able to find your way out.  Pictures attached....  Man, I forgot to snap a picture of the damn sink!  The water was a little too hot so I'm trying to look for the \"cold\" lever. Instead air is drying my hands!  Thanks, Dyson. You are a clever old man.  Love all your stuff. Hahahha...enjoyed this place thoroughly."}
{"text":"Great food. Decent service, Crazy decor. I don't go often because of the lines, but when I do, I always enjoy it.

Don't attend in groups of more than 4, you will never get a table."}
{"text":"Very happy with our experience here.

Ordered a Spanish style breakfast (still cannot remember the name) and duck confit benny.
The orange juice tasted very freshly squeezed, it's like the juice you get when you are eating the actual orange without needing to chew. 

Nice atmosphere and cool design, especially the washroom. Friendly service. 

The fruit skewer is refreshing and def a good way to start a day :)"}
{"text":"I had found this restaurant on yelp before heading up to Montreal for a week-long trip. It was the first breakfast we had, and definitely the best (even though the other food was great too)! We went on a week day and there was still a wait, but not too long which was appreciated (the best restaurants are worth waiting for)!

I liked the serving of fruit first, and my eggs with mushrooms over toast was phenomenal, and enough to take home for seconds! There was a huge variety on the menu. Would definitely recommend going to this establishment! I'd definitely go back if in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Does this place need any more 5 star reviews? Yes. Because I had one of the best brunches of my life there, and I have had so many great brunches. Memories...

I got grilled peach and granola pancakes that were heavenly. The coffee was great. The server was very attentive. The booth was spacious, and the room was full of natural light. Love."}
{"text":"We had to come on a Thursday morning to avoid the lineups that can take hours on the weekends. The food was defiantly very good and the portions are generous. This place definitely had flare and personality. 

The French toast is amazing and perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth. The sauce is creamy with delicious chunks of banana and crispy coconut shavings. Defiantly a shareable dish. 

We ordered the Bobby does Dallas and the duck Benedict. The breakfast potatoes was very good, one of the best ones I've had. The scrambled eggs in the Dallas was cooked very well and was perfectly fluffy. I usually hate scrambled eggs because of the runny texture but this one was almost like a fluffy omelet. The duck beni was on the sweeter side but was delicious as well with a runny yoke."}
{"text":"Always great coming here for brunch even though there is a wait but the egg Benedict's is a must plus a side of pancakes with the excellent maple syrup. Also, check out the cool graffiti work in the restrooms."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés ce dimanche brunché avec des copains. Nous avons attendu 1h avant de rentrer. Peut-être car nous étions un groupe de six. Une fois a l'intérieur nous avons pris notre temps pour commander. La carte propose un large choix . Les filles ont opté pour le dejeuner complet Bon ben moi jprends tout , aucune d'entre nous a fini l'assiette. C'était vraiment copieux et bon. Les pommes de terre étaient bien préparées, le bacon croustillant, le pancake moelleux. Les garçons ont pris les oeufs bénédictines et ils étaient bons aussi. Les milkshakes etaient une tuerie!!!
 Bref c'était bien
Le seul point négatif, c'est l'attente , si vous n'etes pas patient passez votre tour , si vous l'êtes ,essayez l'avenue, leurs déjeuners valent le coup! De toute façon le dimanche on n'est pas pressé."}
{"text":"L'Avenue has the best Eggs Benedict I have ever had. Seriously. As others say, get there a bit early to avoid the lineup. Great portions, great ambiance, and the prices are very reasonable. This is my favorite brunch spot in Montreal. 

And try one of their alcoholic milkshakes - my god! So good!"}
{"text":"Craving French Toast? Sweet? Get it here with bananas, rum sauce, and nutella! Delightful and will leave you literally smiling gleefully like a little kid as your helicopter parents stare at you with jealousy and disdain because you made the best choice! Ever!"}
{"text":"I haven't even left the restaurant yet and already writing s 5 star review! Cappuccino awesome, fruit plate before meal is delicious. My husband ordered the complete meal called something or other in Spain. It was really good. The real treat was my meal. It was a sweet/savory/crunchy eggs Benedict. A.MA.ZING. must have. Service also excellent!!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually one for waiting in long lines for food, but when we were told that L'avenue is the best brunch place in the world (not just Montreal), I hope that it would justify a 50 minute wait in the snowy cold.  When we finally sat down, it felt less like a restaurant and more like a club, with the bright funky decor and techno-house playing in the background.  With an overwhelming assortment of eggs, pancakes, omelets, and benedicts to choose from, you'll have no problem finding exactly what you want.

After taking some time, I ordered the Idaho omelet while the BF opted for the omelet with duck confit.  When the food finally arrived, I was aghast at how large the portion sizes were.  My plate contained a huge, four egg omelet, bursting with ingredients, a ramekin of roasted potatoes, a fruit skewer, and a bagel on the side.  I couldn't get over just how much food was sitting there.  And the taste?  Excellent.  The omelet was cooked perfectly with fluffy eggs and savory ingredients.  I would have preferred my bagel dry instead of slathered already with butter, but not a big complaint.  His duck omelet was also very tasty.

Aside from the slow kitchen and service, I would totally go back in a heartbeat to try more of the menu.  Everything that was coming out of the kitchen looked incredible.  One of the few places that was worth the long long wait just to get in the door.  Best brunch in the world?  That's a stretch, but certainly one to remember for a long long time.

And definitely check out the restrooms!"}
{"text":"Restaurant reconnu pour ses déjeuners dans le plateau mais également pour ses lunchs et dîners. Vous pouvez y voir une longue ligne d'attente tous les week end à partir de 10:30 ou 11 et ce jusqu'à 13h30. En effet l'endroit est différent, un décoration style de rue, une ambiance très animée. Je trouve qu'il est agréable de se retrouver en groupe assis sur les banquettes. Toutefois à mon avis la réputation de ce restaurant est un peu surfait et ne mérite pas la longue attente, à essayer bien évidemment mais il y a beaucoup trop d'options sur la rue mont royal pour s'en contenter. Et surtout le service est toujours pitoyable. Je le lis dans d'autres commentaires et je me rends compte que je ne suis pas la seule à le penser. Pas idéal pour les jeunes enfants et les serveurs ont toujours l'air blasés on les dérange peut être?!?"}
{"text":"As were waiting in the small line we were told by locals that it was worth the wait because it is the best breakfast in Montreal.  They were right.  Beware, we were told sometimes the line is huge. 

Ambiance: Very trendy. They had a LCD TV in the bathroom and crazy music. Very strange bathroom... The seating area was very classy.

Service: Excellent and staff was dressed professionally. Menu is in French only and the server had to explain many of the menu items. The manager was able to sit down with us and point us to some of the \"highlights\" in montreal. These were some of the unknown, hard to find spots.

Food: The best. Large portions and everything tasted awesome. The selection on the menu was almost too much. All 6 of us in our party agreed that this one of the best if not the best breakfast we have ever had. Between us all we ordered French toast, Omelet, eggs Benedict (a few different styles). 

Drinks: Just OK. My Irish coffee was great. But their Bloody Mary needs some serious work.

Cost: With drinks will run you about $20

."}
{"text":"Definitely a must go to stop for breakfast. Great customer service and the food was amazing. Cool and hip atmosphere. Waited about half an hour to get seated but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"\"The best brunch place in the world\" -my fiancé 
Absolutely amazing brunch. I had eggs Benedict with mushrooms, and I'm afraid that I'll never taste any other eggs Benedict as great as these. The environment is lounge like, stylish with graffiti murals and ambient house music. Service is fantastic! If you come to Montreal, you cannot leave without trying the food here. Get here early to beat the lines (before 11AM)."}
{"text":"Got the chorizo Benedict.  Food here is really flavorful and is really filling. Would recommend coming early because even on weekdays, it gets pack!  Would not recommend the omelette because nothing special about it.  5/5! ^_^"}
{"text":"ONE OF THE BEST.

If there's a lineup, wait! It's really worth it. I've tried a few other trendy breakfast places around Montreal but this one really wins my heart, every single time. Every person I've suggested to come here loves this place as well. I really think if you could go to one brunch spot while you're in MTL, this is the one. 

I've tried a few items on the menu (and from my friends' plates), and they are killing it. I've been coming to L'avenue for a few years now and I don't think I will stop anytime soon. Everything is delicious and everything they create just works so well together. Therefore it's hard recommending something. 

Their service is really good and the atmosphere and the design of this place is really something special. This place is also pretty known for their restroom so don't forget to check that out ;)."}
{"text":"Easily the best brunch I've had in Montreal-- highly recommend the steak and eggs Benedict, the Madame P Benedict, and the sangrias!! Great ambiance, cute crowd, nice staff... Need I go on?"}
{"text":"Got to L'Avenue at 9:30 on a weekend and had no wait to get in, so if you want to avoid the line get there early! Amazing food and great service"}
{"text":"When I created the food stops for our Montreal trip, L'Avenue was #1 on my list. My boyfriend was skeptical - \"how good could it possible be that it warrants a line up on such a cold day?\" But I was confident. He should know by now that I am a thorough researcher, and damn do I read too many reviews & look at too many pics before I make a decision on whether to check out a restaurant or not. And WOW, @restolavenue did not disappoint! Amazing! And my bf loved it!  By the way, we got there at just the right time - no line up! There was a line when we left though. 

I ordered the delicious and super massive (each slice the size of my face) French toast. It was so rich and delicious. 

In sum:

Amazing service, great value, great portions & so delicious! You gotta check them out if you find yourself in Montreal. 

P.S. I agree with the other reviewers... check out the washroom - even if you don't have to go."}
{"text":"930 attempt of 2 without reservations.
We barely waited but seats filled up super fast and soon there was at least a 30 people line out the door (into the freezing cold) 

We heard so much about this place so we were excited to try but unfortunately I'd vote for other brunch spots in the city, taste-wise. Although, portions are HUGE so prepared to be stuffed.

We had the everything platter (names are foggy now) and the sweet salty eggs Benedict/ poached eggs.

We were promptly served fruits after ordering and service was always friendly, efficient.
Pancakes were fluffy, french toast was normal. Eggs were done very well though by everything else was just normal. 
Yes, restrooms are cool but .. not sure why it's soooo crowded vs other spots.."}
{"text":"Freaking delicious.

Cappuccino is rich and creamy. $3

Watermelon water? OH-KAY!

Benedict is huge- we had both the chorizo and monsieur (spinach, mushrooms, goat cheese). They come with a side of garlic potatoes and a skewer of fresh amazing fruit (melon, strawberry, grapefruit, pineapple). We could have split it. $15

Service took awhile but was very friendly. We went at 9AM on Saturday and had no wait.

Very cool ambiance and decor.

Amazing brunch option!"}
{"text":"This was the last establishment that my friends and I had hit up prior to our long drive back to NYC. We had thought about eating here earlier, but was scared off by the super long queues the day prior. We figured there wouldn't be as long of a wait on a Monday morning, and we were right. We were seated almost immediately upon reaching the restaurant.

Aside from the eclectic decor, the menu offers plenty of different options to suit most palates. I got their truffled mushroom omelette, which I thought erred a little on the bland side, though the mushrooms themselves were delicious. The potatoes that came with my dish were also good, but at this point in my trip, I kind of never wanted to see another potato again. Portions were gargantuan so I definitely felt like I got my money's worth, but I thought the food would've been jaw-droppingly awesome considering how long the queues had been just the day before, and presumably every weekend. I'm not sure I would've waited for more than half an hour for the meal I had been served, to be quite honest, so I was especially glad that I didn't have to wait when we actually ate here.

Service was excellent, though, and the bathrooms were also quite interesting. Oh, and every entree comes with fruit skewers and watermelon flavored water. 3.5 stars, really."}
{"text":"Delicious eggs benedict (numerous variations, I had the one with smoked salmon), served with a big skewer of fresh fruit. Crowded, hip spot with a wait, even in freezing winter.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that I think service lacked a little, looked over for locals (which part of me understands, you have to take care of regulars, but it holds me back on that last star).

p.s. ladies, check out the restroom. Very cool, walls with anime and art, bright red lighting--very red light district hip looking."}
{"text":"Came here on a freezing day and waited outside for half an hour! But the food here was definitely worth the wait! I got a huge platter of everything (pancakes, French toast, beans and assorted meat). Everything was just of tradition, but everything was made by heart, so well flavoured and so unique and delicate! My girlfriend had the egg Benedict with pulled duck, which was terrific! There were at least three layers of flavour popping in your mouth, sweet, savoury, creamy and thick...it was the best we've ever had in Montreal.
And I have to mention the Nutella coffee which was made by imported Italian Nutella, which gave the coffee a hint of nut fragrance, so special and delicious..."}
{"text":"My problem at L'Avenue is that I'm sold by the time I read the first column of menu items on the first page. Today we took baby steps towards branching out at our go-to brunch spot. We took a gander at the Benedicts and immediately chose Sucre-Sale-Croustillant - An eggs Benedict with panko encrusted French toast, maple syrup, House made braised ham (instead of the black forest ham) and Gruyere cheese. Next we split the Dejeuner Cabane a Sucre - A safe bet for a filling breakfast with both savoury and sweet components. 

Another absolutely to-die-for brunch at L'Avenue is in the books. Until next time!"}
{"text":"This place is always AMAZING !!! Always have something new and creative and fun surprises . The water was watermelon flavoured that just blew my mind. Would recommend this one to anyone and everyone looking for a fun and place to eat with great food."}
{"text":"The portions are HUUUGE! And oh so very yummy. Fresh food with each plate and the selection is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This place has spoiled me from all breakfast places. Nothing will compare. 
The only problem now is that I live 550KM away from it. 

I had the bobby does dallas and it was probably one of the most decadent, savory breakfasts I've ever had. 

Everyone must get this dish period if they want a good complete meal or possibly an amazing hang over food. 

The bathrooms are a little ridiculous and cosmic though."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times, I would avoid the weekend for the long line. If you are visiting and you really wanna try it, go a bit early. The ambience is great, they have good house/techno playing the background. The staff is very nice and the food is legit. Check out the bathroom, it is pretty funky. You can go there for lunch and dinner during the week too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I arrived in Montreal for a weekend trip and were STARVING. We found L'Avenue just through a few google searches and were immediately seated upon arrival. 
What's funny is we chose the place because it looked like it would have a good burger, although once we walked through the restaurant, we realized that everyone was ordering eggs benedict.

When we looked at the menu and realized that they had an entire page dedicated to eggs benedicts, we realized this was one of their specialty. My boyfriend ordered the classic benedict and it came with the BEST ham I think either of us have ever tasted. I ordered some sort of benedict that came with spinach and goat cheese. Both were SO good.

The meal came with potatoes on the side and a fruit skewer as an appetizer. Both my boyfriend and I commented on how fresh the fruit tasted compared to other restaurants. 

Our server was amazingly attentive and our food arrived quickly.

I'm not sure that I would change anything about the experience. This place is worth a visit. My boyfriend said that he would eat breakfast every day of this trip there and be completely happy."}
{"text":"Okay, first of all, holy shit. This place is worth the long line it gets literally even before it opens. My boyfriend and I came back twice in our few days vacation. 

The service is fast. It's not super attentive as you can guess with so many customers, but it was fast. 

The ambiance is hip and modern, and the menus are super cute. Was generally super fun to look around, and the bathrooms were memorable. I stared around the room for a few minutes after I finished my business just to read everything on the wall. 

The food. Bruh. The food. It's delicious. The fruit skewer we got in the beginning was super fresh and a great start to a meal. Also - the maple syrup. For any uninitiated Americans like me and my boyfriend, that maple syrup will change your life forever and leave you continuously disappointed by the pathetic sugar-water that Americans call \"maple syrup.\" The syrup was so delicious, and had a slight vanilla taste. I could chug that shit endlessly. There's a lot of food as well.

The drinks. BRUH. So my boyfriend and I like to drink. We can split a pitcher of sangria/mimosa easily at most places. So, we ordered a pitcher. They do not fuck around. It was seriously strong, and not even diluted with ice. Needless to say, I practically died that day from a nearly-lethal mixture of Sangria, maple syrup, and breakfast potatoes. But I recovered enough to come back two days later.

So, take the time to wait for L'Avenue. It's an absolute MUST and I do gotta say, I think about that maple syrup almost every week."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever!

So here's the catch. Regardless on what time you get to the restaurant, you're guaranteed to wait for a table. 
You're looking at a wait time of anywhere between twenty to forty minutes, typically. 

On a Sunday at around noon, however, you're looking at almost two hours. I had actually considered getting out of line and getting something else but after an hour of waiting, I was pretty dedicated. 

When we finally got in, the service was quick, but not rushed. The staff was as attentive as they possibly could of been given the sheer amount of people in the restaurant. 

We both ordered the Sucré Salé. It arrived and it was absolutely amazing. The egg was poached exactly how I'd asked them, the French toast was perfect and the hollandaise sauce was sublime. The potatoes were so good. And they weren't greasy like your average breakfast potato. 

Overall, I'm impressed with the restaurant. A good breakfast in a really trendy restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is overly pretentious.

It's unfair to comment on the wait outside seeing as that's out of control.  However, the wait for our food was obscenely long.  It took 35 minutes to get our order of fried calamari, and then it took another half hour to get our club sandwiches.  It shouldn't take that long to make a cold sandwich.  The sandwich was very unappealing, there was barely any guacamole in it, it was turning brown as well.  My friend's truffle omelette was soaked in oil and had no trace of truffle flavouring.

Customers that arrived after we did got their fruits long before we did as well, even after we asked them to bring us ours.

The hollandaise sauce at this place is at best mediocre, it's flavourless, too thick, and the food in general is far too oily.

Getting the staff's attention is overly difficult, they should focus less on how \"hip\" theyre dressing and focus more on service and communicating to the kitchen that their food is very disappointing.

Would not visit again, and will actively suggest to others to avoid this place."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fat-tastic! There is a reason for the wait, and so if you have the luxury to come at an off peak time, then take your chance! They have a huge page of eggs benedict concoctions! Our large group had a number of eggs benedict, and none of them disappointed. I also thoroughly enjoyed the potatoes and the salad that accompany it. I always appreciate when the sides receive as much attention to flavor as the rest of the dish. I also liked the skewered fruit that precedes the meal. The portions are quite large, and you will not leave here even remotely hungry! I struggled to attempt to finish my potatoes... they were so tasty. Perhaps I shouldn't have ordered my milk shake, but it was so delicious, I still don't regret it. THIS IS A PLACE TO WHICH I MUST RETURN!"}
{"text":"If you're feeling hungover and think that L'Avenue is a great place to go for breakfast... STOP EVERYTHING.  

First, it'll take about an hour at peak times before you're seated. Then, once you finally do get a table, it'll be next to the DJ who's blaring (seriously, blaring) some awful, d-grade, repetitive house music. You'll eat faster than you ever have because (a) that's what 180 bpm will do to your chewing pattern, and (b) the throbbing headache that ensues will be too unbearable to stay any longer. 

Admittedly, their brunch menu is amazing (probably the best potatoes in the city). And maybe I'm just being a curmudgeon about this, but it's hard to enjoy a meal when your head is rattling from the bass."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for brunch, waited for an hour in line, but it was all worth it! I ordered the egg Benedict with steak and a green smoothie. Started off with a fruit skewer, I was amazed by the size of the smoothie. It tasted so good that I drank halfway before the food came, and therefore, ended up not being able to finish my meal. The egg benedict was the star, the best one I've tried so far. The egg was perfectly poached, the steak was juicy and tasteful, and the hollandaise sauce tied everything together. Very excited to come (earlier next time) for more!"}
{"text":"Des portions généreuses , bonne place pour les amateurs de bénédictines !! Prévoir de l'attente avant d'avoir une table, 
Car endroit toujours achalandé, même en semaine.."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
This place is located on Avenue du Mont-Royal E and Avenue Papineau. Paid street parking is available. There was a lineup outside the entrance when we went on a Sunday at around 11AM. 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Our server, Benoit, was wonderful. We had to wait quite a long time for our food to arrive, but that's probably because they had a full-house and each dish was made with care and perfection.

[DÉCOR] - 5/5 
Retro, fun, and had a \"Film\" theme. Booths were very cozy and all chairs looked comfortable. The bathroom was so cool because it used black light and had graffiti art on the walls! 

[QUALITY] - 5/5
The dishes tasted homemade, had fresh ingredients, and had great presentation! 

[ORDER] - 5/5
- I'll Take It All - $17.66: had the 2 eggs and bacon. Cretons (pork spread) was deliciously savoury. Homemade sausage and homemade baked beans tasted wonderful because they were made from scratch. Pancakes were thick and fluffy. Eggs on the French toast did not soak all the way through, but were still pleasantly sweet with maple syrup. Breakfast potatoes were well-seasoned, and fruits were fresh. 

- Rainbow Eggs Benedict - $17.77: had 2 perfectly cooked poached eggs. Smoked salmon was soft and fresh. Cream cheese, and Hollandaise sauce were rich and decadent. Capers added a hint of lightness to the dish.

- Nutella Coffee - $4.95: made with imported Italian Nutella, and had a delicious balance of sweet and bitter undertones. I would definitely recommend getting this beautiful drink.  

[OVERALL] - 5/5 
A wonderful place for brunch. The \"I'll Take It All\" had such a large variety and portion of different foods. I also had one of the best smoked salmon benedicts from a brunch place! I would definitely recommend this place for its wonderful ambiance and delicious food."}
{"text":"* Remember! Make sure to bring a camera (or your phone) for a selfie to the washroom. *

After getting totally turned off by Yolk, I stayed away from having bennys in Vancouver for a while. But L'Avenue revived my love for benny brunch again. I can very comfortably say this smoked salmon benny is the best benny I have ever had in my life. Almost close to perfect. I also tasted some of mushroom spinach benny as well and it was really good as well. The poached eggs were cooked to a perfection. And the hollandaise sauce was delicious and the texture was just heavenly. 

Oh the appetizer fruit skewer was a great touch as well."}
{"text":"Awesome place, very hip, filled with young people and young music. Very large portions!!! Five stars!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location -I came here for brunch on a Saturday around 1ish. There was a lineup but not a huge one and the wait for a table wasn't too long (although we were two -I think the wait time for larger groups would be longer since the space inside isn't huge). The service was friendly and the prices aren't over the top. The decor in the avenue restaurants is always a little funky (In a good way) bright upbeat colours and always clean. Their filter coffee was actually very good compared to most breakfast places (they use lavazza coffee  I believe) Even their water has a little something extra always cold with a hint of watermelon flavour. I tried an egg Benedict dish which was very good such great flavour without being overpowering and the portion size was more than enough to be filling. My boyfriend had a chorizo scramble which was also a huge portion and was very tasty , but he said he would prefer to order one of their more unique items like the one I had because it's something you can't really order elsewhere in terms of the flavours and  the unique twist they put on the dish.they also bring you a little plate of fruit as a kind of free starter which is a nice touch . I would recommend this spot to anyone who wants good quality breakfast/brunch since they have your more classic eggs and bacon dishes but also offer some more unique options for the more adventurous eater ! (Lunch items also available for those who aren't crazy about breakfast but still want to go out with their brunch loving friends or significant other etc) . No outdoor seating available but they have a somewhat open concept towards the back of the restaurant on warmer days where you can still enjoy the fresh air"}
{"text":"A third of my group enjoyed their meal here, though if you ask for any substitutions, prepare for it to go in one ear and out the other. Your meal will be 80% hollandaise sauce. Oh and the french toast was superb.

Overall - drinks are great, wait was long, service was whatever, but you'll definitely want to visit the bathroom for a fun selfie."}
{"text":"I've been here for supper and for brunch.  The dinner menu is good but I deifnitely prefer this place for brunch.  The line-ups to get a table can sometimes be long which is annoying however it is definitely worth the wait.

They always serve a fruit skewer with their plates and I like that a lot.  The pancakes are nice and fluffy and I am a fan of using the baguette for toast.  The potatoes too are delicious!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Many original dishes. Food is good. Service is excellent. A refreshing change from many spots."}
{"text":"Go here every time I am in Montreal because these are the best egg benedicts I have ever taste and their fruit smoothies are delicious :)"}
{"text":"It was the best brunch I ever had, seriously. When I was looking through pics on yelp, I though it looks pretty average. Well, don't let pics confuse you. Food is amazing over there! It's just so tasty and perfect! Portions are huge! Drinks are amazing too! Prices are reasonable. Service is excellent! I would go there again. Also, don't forget to check their restroom, it looks pretty cool :)"}
{"text":"Great quality brunch! 

This was the first time I tried this location and am already looking forward to going back. We arrived to a lineup of people but were the only group of two and were seated right away (lucky us!). The menu is large and everything looked amazing. So many unique options! Ironically, me and my partner chose the same thing. We waited longer than expected for our meals. That was disappointing as we saw many tables who ordered after us get their food before us. However, when the food came, they proved that the wait was worth it! A picture is worth a thousand words so I'll let the picture describe the deliciousness. (best potatoes ever!). Huge portion so I had enough for dinner when I finally got hungry again.

The restaurant itself is super cool and similar to the other location. Bathrooms are different though but equally fun!

{"text":"Worth the wait in line. This place has been around for years. On my last visit, I had the Reese's pieces milkshake and the carrot cake pancakes.. I recommend both if you are a fan of sugar! Waitress was fantastic."}
{"text":"We visited this place for brunch on our first full day in Montreal. I guess we got lucky because we were seated immediately. On our way out there was a line of people waiting down the block and apparently, that's common. 

We were here for the food, but I have to confess I was completely distracted by the atmosphere. We were seated in the back near the coffee station and it was possibly the worst spot in the entire restaurant. On one side we were an inch from the next table... so close that I felt like I was practically dining WITH them and on the other side servers were passing us constantly. It was distracting and chaotic and honestly, made it very hard for me to enjoy my meal. I wish we would have requested a booth and would advise doing so even if it means waiting longer.

Now, on to the food. It was yummy and plentiful! My honey and I both got versions of their eggs benedict. He got the one with duck and mine had mushrooms and goat cheese. I enjoyed mine, but with the combination of the goat cheese and hollandaise sauce it was really rich. I had a hard time eating even half of it. The potatoes were delicious. My favorite part of the meal was probably the plentiful coffee and the free fruit skewer they give you before your meal arrives. I had never seen that before and thought it was a really nice touch! Our server was attentive, but not overly friendly. I could tell he had a lot of tables and was trying to be as efficient as possible. 

Overall, a good meal, but I wonder if this is one of those places where the buzz is better than the actual experience....

PS- They now have menus in English so no need to worry about that if you don't speak French!"}
{"text":"Easily the best breakfast I've had in Canada. Totally worth the 1+ hour wait in the 80 degree heat, trust me you have to wait! I would recommend getting the French Toast, it was simply perfect. Very moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. I'm getting hungry just thinking of it.

Also good:
- their meat paste thingy (apparently a Quebec recipe)
- Mimosas are fabulous
- Potatoes are grilled nicely with an tasty seasoning

Would probably go back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Restaurant incontournable pour le brunch. Grosses portions pour le prix! Venez tôt (avant 9h la fin de semaine) pour éviter une longue file. Le chai latte n'est pas sur le menu mais vaut le coup. Pensez aussi à aller voir les toilettes!"}
{"text":"The wait is so long on the weekend, but my boyfriend and I went on a weekday and it was incredible. They have more eggs benedicts than I could ever imagine. My boyfriend went for the sweeter option with the Nutella pancakes, which he said were also very good. Everything tastes fresh and the food comes out nice and quick. The fresh fruit skewer is a nice touch. 

The decor is incredible hip and cheeky. It was a really nice environment to enjoy a meal, even though the tables were close together. It was only a tad impersonal, but this is expected with so many customers at once. I appreciated how attentive our waitress was even with that being the case!"}
{"text":"Went there for a brunch since lots of people has recommended and never really had a chance to do and when I really want to go, there's a always a huge line up except weekdays lol

So here I am, I gotta say, I ordered the omelet and I didn't enjoy as much as I wanted to. The food is taste really good, don't get me wrong, it was just not what I was expecting. Food quality is good! Don't let my own subjective taste have a bad influence on you.

My wife loved their egg Benedict with smoked meat by the way!

Service wise, it was great and I got offered with great caring. The waitress saw half of my plate didn't moved and it raised her concern. You might say that's normal but let me tell you, I've been to some restaurants where they don't blink an eye even you didn't touch it at all.

The waitress offered to speak with their Chef and I had to explained to her it wasnt their fault lol

Seriously, I am going to go back and ordered different food."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict. That is the only thing you should be ordering here is that. They have an entire page of the menu dedicated to different variants. My date and I had the smoked salmon and the \"savory sweet crunchy\" variants and both were phenomenal. The side of fried potatoes were also amazing and full of flavor.

The wait to get in was well over an hour when we got there mid morning on a Sunday, but it was worth it.

The one negative I can point to is the monitor. I had their raspberry mojito and it was awful. Really awful. I don't generally send back dishes/drinks at restaurants, but this I did. The waitress was really nice about it though and I wasn't billed for the drink, so no harm done. Just order something different to drink!

Oh, and you have to visit the restroom while you're there. Trust me."}
{"text":"Nutella Milk French Toast!!!! That's all I have to say! The food, service and ambiance are all 5 stars at this place and wish i had a longer trip to Montreal to visit again. we got the huevoes rancheros and the frencht oast both of which I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a cute breakfast spot with a huge selection of breakfast/brunch options. The cappuccino and fresh juices were very good. The food portions here are huge! The egg combination dishes give you more than enough food for even the hungriest diner. My scrambled eggs were fluffy and flavorful - cooked perfectly. The pancakes (crepes americaine) are lighter and fluffier than most American pancakes. It was a pleasant change. The French toast was fantastic, topped high with lots of fresh banana, strawberries, and blueberries. 

The servers here were great - very friendly and attentive! 

We easily found street parking on a weekday morning, but it looks like this would be a crowded spot on the weekends, when train travel would probably be better than driving."}
{"text":"This might be the best breakfast I had all year.  I ordered a simple bagel and was pleasantly surprised that it came with fresh fruit (delicious!) and potatoes.  The cappuccino I ordered was delicious. The interior of the restaurant is nicely decorated (definitely check out the bathroom!) and it was well worth the short wait to get in."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite brunch places in Montreal! Love the food but hate the lineup! The worst is waiting in line in the winter time. Recently I went on a rainy Sunday around 3 pm and this time the wait was only about 15 min which is really not bad because usually it is a lot longer.
Normally I order the steak and eggs benedict which is amazing btw but this time I wanted to change it up so I got the breakfast poutine with extra sausage. The breakfast poutine consists of homemade sausage, leeks, peppers mushrooms, onions, cheese curds, poached egg and Hollandaise sauce.The sausage was really the best part of the poutine! It was very good. My only complaint would be that they didn't put enough potatoes in the breakfast poutine. Be aware that the potatoes are not fries... they are thin potato wedges. My date had the sweet-salty eggs benedict. I'm not usually a fan of sweet and salty things but it was good!! It consisted of two poached eggs on French toast which was crunchy because it was covered with panko. They also put some maple syrup for the sweetness. Then on top of the French toast was a piece of black forest ham, gruyere cheese and Hollandaise sauce. The water is infused with watermelon and it tastes so good and fresh. The décor is so cool... especially the bathroom!! So go check it out!!"}
{"text":"For our final breakfast - and perhaps the biggest curveball of the trip to Montreal - we settled on L'Avenue even though I'd heard very mixed things; some claiming that its only appeal was that locals found it to be kitschy and \"American\" while others claimed it was worth the often interminable waits, lousy service, and French-only menus as the restaurant served the best breakfasts in town.  No stranger to early arrivals for great food but not particularly sold on the Eggs Benny-centric menu (apparently not as ubiquitous in Montreal as in the United States) we waxed and waned on L'Avenue until the last minute and in the end, after a very late night at APdC we decided \"why not?\" and arrived thirty minutes after they opened the doors.

A hip restaurant - long and narrow with reclaimed wood and spray-painted exposed brick plus vinyl, motorcycles, and oddly positioned manikins the dominant features aside from a long bar and partially open kitchen - our arrival at L'Avenue would be met by a largely open dining room with perhaps only three tables already seated and greeted at the door by a young woman who's English was only slightly worse than my French we were led quickly to a table near the front where Vinyl-album style menus (French only) were provided and drink orders were placed - deux café et une lait - the former acrid, luke warm, and rarely refilled while the later was first delivered as café au lait and later completely forgotten until the server was reminded...not a good start.

Seated and listening to the music overhead as I translated the menu for my mother and aunt it would be some time before our server returned and after the drink order we set to simply pointing out our options on the menu to be sure all went well - a successful strategy as it would turn out, though it would take twenty minutes before she returned to inform me that the poutine I'd selected could not be ordered until after 10am and another fifteen minutes thereafter before our plates would arrive along with an unexpected $1.50 side of bacon that no one knowingly ordered (and was subsequently removed from our bill after speaking with an older woman who explained to us that our server was 'new'.)

 Moving on to the reason we'd originally selected L'Avenue, namely the food, the humor of the previous day's fail extended on when my aunt's mixed fruit pancakes turned out even worse than those at Beauty's and although the Blueberries, Strawberries, and Banana all proved fresh and tasty the cakes themselves were not only doughy but shockingly dry to the point of nearly being inedible.  Again refusing to utilize any maple syrup (I'm rather certain a blend rather than being pure) despite the fact that these 'cakes were clearly in need all we could do was laugh - another fail from the only person I know to have ordered dry pancakes at Hollywood's Griddle Café this disaster simply seemed appropriate.

Moving on to the bigger and better things, my mother's selection of Caramel Banana Crepes served with a fruit skewer would prove to be a good choice while also surprisingly light as the dainty crepe was doubled over and folded around raw bananas lightly tinged with warm salty caramel.  Again paired with an accompaniment of high quality fruit despite the later winter/early spring I particularly enjoyed the toothsome whole wheat texture of the crepes, though I think we'd have all preferred the bananas to at least be warmed.

For my selection, without doubt the most decadent of the group, Chocolate, Caramelized Pear, and Maple Caramel Pancakes would arrive with the same lackluster texture of my aunt's selection but with an ample layer of Belcolade bittersweet chocolate disks, sautéed pears, and a half-cup of buttery pear jus mixed with maple syrup and salty caramel over top there was no semblance of 'dry' on this plate, just a whole lot of richness and a distinct lack of subtlety where a little went a long way; the best item of a nearly $45 breakfast after tax and tip where the only real 'highlight' was the bathroom - a really cool bathroom - but not a bathroom warranting a $15/pp admission price."}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I had been researching Montreal's best brunch spots ahead of a 4 day trip and L'Avenue consistently came up as one of the spots not to miss.

Absolutely lives up to the hype. The decor feels really fresh, and it's a really comfortable environment. The staff are really friendly and the food is to die for. We came on a Friday morning at 10.30am and didn't have to wait to get a table.

The portions are massive and our eyes were definitely bigger than our bellies! We both got the \"indecisive\" dish.. a mix of sweet and savory.. And they certainly didn't hold back on either.

Sounds like we lucked out on not having to wait but I'd happily do so to come back again!

No doubt one of the best brunches I've had!"}
{"text":"Great food - great atmosphere - great host (as I don't speak French.)

Highly recommend for brunch."}
{"text":"First off, this place was PACKED!
When there is a line up outside with people wanting to eat breakfast, you know the place is good.

The portions are huge and the food is delicious. Everything tastes healthy, even the food that shouldn't. Lots of fresh fruit and berries with every entree.
If you can stomach the wait, it's damn well worth it.

Side note, the restrooms are crazy in a great artistic way. Don't go in there if you are on some sort of hallucinogen because you will trip balls."}
{"text":"Amazing eggs Benedict with chorizo that comes with a small crock of potatoes & cheese. Fruit kebab was an imaginative and welcome addition to the meal.  
Even the pancake was surprisingly good. 
 
Was interesting guessing what each French item was, using all of my \"Sherlock Holmesian\" deductive reasoning skills (legume = vegetable, oeuf = egg, bouef = beef, pâte = pasta, pâté = liver, etc...). Of course, my omnivore status meant I became royal food taster for my legume friends... 

It definitely lives up to expectations, but perhaps a bit over-hyped. Not necessarily any better than, say, Clinton Street Bakery (or Dozens more within the City). And what is up with no decaf coffee?!"}
{"text":"Waited for almost 2 hours on Saturday morning and then get seated by the kind waitress. Tried the spinach and mushroom bennies and I am absolutely have to admit that it was worth the waiting. Because it was sooooo good. My friend tried the smoked meat bennies, it was with a decent portion. Love it, would consider to visit it again when I have friend pay visit here and it's not weekend morning."}
{"text":"Wish they had more options for vegetarian. However their milkshakes are the best I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Plein à craquer, il faut s'armer de patience avant d'avoir une place assise mais les déjeuners sont variés et délicieux!"}
{"text":"Last stop in Montreal was breakfast and it was a great breakfast before hitting the road. Well worth the wait, service was very friendly and accommodating.  We were given fruit skewers to start, nice touch! I loved the \"indecisive\" menu selection-- got over easy eggs, home fries, bacon, sausage and carrot cake pancakes -- oh wow, amazingly good food. I want the recipe for their home fries because they are wicked! The pancakes with the cream cheese icing was spectacular and didn't require maple syrup at all, but I very much appreciated the real deal on the table. Matthew had the mashed potato omelet and it was gigantic! It also came with hash browns and a baguette. Instead of the traditional coffee, I went with hot chocolate (which was forgotten for a while)-- adorned with a strawberry and whipped cream, it was so decadent! 

Also, as previous reviewers have mentioned, you have to check out the bathroom, even if you don't have to go -- whimsical and fun! Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The lines are worth it! Best brunch we had in Montreal. I loved the \"indecisive\" menu option that lets you pick a sweet pancake and two savory options to go with your eggs. All this comes with a side of bread and fruit. Everything was delicious and there was a ton of food! 

Also, loved the decor. And the service was great."}
{"text":"It's usually a pretty good sign when a place has this many reviews and such a high rating. We were definitely not disappointed! It was well worth the line we stood in outside for a table. The food was amazing!
You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"In an effort to avoid the alleged long lines of L'Avenue during the weekend brunch rush, I refrained from coming here until the Monday of my vacation in Montreal.  

I walked in around 10am.  I think there was one couple in the entire restaurant.  The plan was successful!

It's a spunky looking restaurant, and shaped in a rectangle with tables and chairs lining all the way down, and the cooking going on across the other side.  There are a couple of manikins strategically placed and in funny positions.  The menu is entirely in French, so if you don't speak a word - either bring a dictionary (like I did), or if you've joined the modern technological world (unlike me), use a phone app to translate - and you're golden.  Who knew champignon meant mushroom. ;-)  

I ordered the eggs benedict that comes over French toast instead of an English muffin (ha ha, nice), with the maple syrup on the side.  I think it's called the Benedict Sucre or something along those lines.   The service is nice and friendly, but not hugely attentive.  Nearly ten minutes went by before they came to take my order, even though they saw my menu closed and  I was the only one waiting to order..  but they were standing around talking with one another.  Granted my French is non-existent, I think they were training a new employee...  based off of the body language.  

I ordered a cup of coffee, but it was kind of lukewarm.  Oh well.  I came for the benedict anyhow.  Which was..  a delicious sight for the eyes!  Thick slices of brioche French toast, thin slices of ham, nicely poached eggs, and a buttery Hollandaise generously smeared over it all.  A small cruet of maple syrup and cup of sauteed potatoes in the center.  And a skewer of fresh fruit.  (truly enjoyed that about Montreal..  as they bring you fruit and/or salad with almost every meal)  

The Hollandaise was a bit heavy, and next time I'd ask for them to go easy on it - albeit it's very yummy and velvety.  

Prices are a bit high, but you do get a ton of good food for it, and so a benedict dish with a cup of coffee will run you about $20 including the tip.  

It's located a couple of blocks away from the Mont Royal metro station.  A great place to walk afterward is down the opposite way (westward) towards St. Denis - lots of shopping opportunities.  If you're looking for poutine, it's not far from here (15 min walk?) at La Banquise.  Schwartz' smoked meats is about a 30 min walk southwest."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever.  Excellent portions.  Whatever you order, it starts with a skewer of fruit.  Watermelon infused water.  Amazing breakfast potatoes and absolutely the best French toast. And even if you don't have to, check out their bathrooms! (Never said that in a review before)."}
{"text":"Had brunch with a friend.  His pancake portions was big be sure you can eat if you order it, it is delicious.

I don't know what they do with their potatoes but you need to eat it.  Usually I toss my breakfast potatoes."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!! This place met all the reviews. However, brush up on your french because menu is only in french. The portions are large and very filing. But so good. Highly recommend the banana nutella french toast, and the Eggs Benedict's they are famous for worth it. 

I would probably pick the benedict florentine or mushroom next time, but the steak eggs benedict was hearty and delivered exactly as promised."}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes outside in 15 degree weather - TOTALLY WORTH IT! I got the avocado toast and my husband got one of the omelets and we shared a little French toast! There were so many delicious choices- everything we orwas amazing and everything that we saw come out of the kitchen looked amazing too!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, first time there, went for my birthday, portions are large and tasty. I would definitely go there again and try something else. 
Lineup is long make sure you give yourself a good half am hour wait."}
{"text":"L'Avenue du Plateau is a popular breakfast place in Montreal and is primary known for two things: Humungous portions and their bathrooms.

I had read that this place is very popular and that people start lining up quickly, so we made sure to get there early as we had a flight to catch later in the day.

Upon entering, we were quickly seated. Decorations throughout the restaurant are quirky and eclectic. Some of the decorations include a huge can of maple syrup hanging from the ceiling, a mannequin, a bicycle mounted on the wall, and street art adorning the walls.

The French Toast with Caramelized Bananas, Nutella, Coconut and Rum Sauce will certainly get your diabetes on in a hurry. Six super thick slices of breaded is loaded with bananas, what seems like a jar of Nutella, coconut shavings all swimming in a pool of rum sauce. If that wasn't enough, they give you a side of extra sauce to boot. The flavors went well together, but was a tad on the sweet side. My only complaint was that the French Toast was not as soggy as I like, which is the norm. I found that although I ask for French Toast super soggy, most places only comply about 1% of the time.

The Montreal Smoked Meat Benedict replaces the traditional Canadian bacon with tender smoked meat. The result is a more meaty, and slightly saltier end product. That's a winning combination in my book. The Hollandaise sauce was nicely prepared and the eggs perfectly poached. The potatoes were also good, but could have been crispier.

The Steak & Eggs Benedict was piled high with tender cuts of steak and meaty mushrooms covered in a black pepper heavy Hollandaise sauce. The result was another winning combination.

Each dish also comes with a side of huge cuts of fruits impaled on a skewer big enough to kill Dracula, unfortunately I seem to have deleted the picture.

The bathrooms are also a must visit even if you don't have to use it. Just perusing the art is worthy enough for a visit.

For a fun and friendly atmosphere with good food and large portions, L'Avenue du Plateau is a must visit."}
{"text":"If you want a unique delicious breakfast come here ! The food in mind blowing !!! I have never had a breakfast like this, I have the steak and eggs and it was cooked to perfection! The steak was tender, the eggs were cooked to perfection ! Highly recommended for anybody visiting the Montreal. 
- The decor is super funky and cool and service is great."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch spot! The food is delicious and the menu is expansive, creative and fresh! We started with fresh fruit. There are a dozen delicious options for eggs Benedict. I had eggs with caramelized onions, mushrooms and cheese. Fantastic. Great coffee and fresh juice. We didn't have mimosas but they appeared on point. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ever wondered why there was a long lineup in front of this place?  It's because it's actually pretty good!  I wouldn't be caught in a lineup there but if you go on an off-day you won't be disappointed.  The choices are rather overwhelming but they should have you covered.  They even cater to the indecisive folks with a sweet/salty.

I've had various breakfast plates from L'Avenue and they serve large tasty portions (potatoes are killer), the prices are fair (breakfasts are a racket though) and the service usually pretty good.

My go-to has usually been the dejeuner fruité but I can confirm the hurvos rancheros are top notch."}
{"text":"We ordered egg Benedict and Nutella coffee. For us the Nutella coffee was way too sweet, but the entrees came in huge portions!! And please go to the washroom!!! It was the best room ever"}
{"text":"Love love love! I love the way they serve you some fruits before you begin your meal. Friendly staff, great service, delicious food! We ordered the steak & eggs benedict and the Montreal smoked meat eggs Benedict. I absolutely loved it and can't to come back and try other things on the menu. The Nutella coffee was very sweet, but I mean common, it's Nutella so of course it's sweet :)"}
{"text":"This was my favorite brunch spot I've ever been too and that's saying a lot since I'm from New York! The carrot cake pancakes are amazing! 100% a must try if you're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"SO good!  A friend from Montreal recommended this place, so when i found myself with an extra day in town, i took his advice and headed over.  I sat down, looked at the menu... and realized it was entirely in french.  I told the waitress that i didn't understand the menu, and that i wanted a vegetarian item, and to just give me whatever was most popular among vegetarians.  She recommended the vegetable eggs benedict, and it was GREAT.  So flavorful, and so unique tasting.  I also loved the fruit skewer starter. Finally, the colorful/quirky vibe, and fascinating bathroom only added to the great experience.  This was definitely my tastiest meal in Montreal."}
{"text":"I really like Avenue Notre-Dame compared to Mont-Royal one, since there's no lineup and both the food & service were really impressive! The decor of Avenue is super hype as usual, featuring street art graffiti wall, eccentric model, motorcycle on the wall, crazy neon toilets (all three of them were different and insanely original), so it's very instagrammable in every aspect. However, they didn't offer the fruit brochette as they were doing at Avenue Mont-Royal, but that's a minor detail. I ordered Huevos Rancheros, which is tortilla with generous salsa mountain, cheddar, egg as well as potato on the side, the portion was huge and the price very fair. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that l'avenue did not impress as much as I wanted (since I had such a high expectation for this brunch place). Compared to Régine Café and Passé Composé, l'Avenue is really average, and the price is pretty much the same. It's rare that I cannot finish a brunch plate because I always prepare myself for brunch with an empty stomach, and I didn't finish my dish at l'Avenue. Their fruit brochette was nice, but the actual brunch let me down. I think it is a bit overrated and the food didn't wow me. I find the interior decor quite cool but quite unfitting with the clientele, they have a lot of graffiti and neon on their walls, but most clients are coming in family. However this place is always packed, so make sure to go there during the week or you would have to wait forever to get a table."}
{"text":"Le running-gag entre Montréalais, c'est que les deux succursales de ce restaurant sont toujours bondées de gens, les fins de semaine! J'ai donc eu un flash lorsque j'ai obtenu congé un jeudi: c'était le moment ou jamais d'y aller!

Je trouve que le resto mérite l'attention qu'il reçoit, c'est-à-dire qu'il se démarque des autres restaurants à déjeuner. La serveuse était fine-fine, la nourriture était abondante et succulente et le décor est hipster à souhait.

J'ai choisi le brunch de \"chicken-waffle\" et je le recommande. C'est un plat assez populaire dorénavant et je l'ai commandé à plusieurs autres endroits. Cependant, c'était la première fois que j'en voyais un qui était fait à la manière \"Général Tao\" et ça m'a beaucoup plu. La seule remarque que je ferais, c'est que j'aimerais dont ça si les restaurants indiquaient clairement sur leurs menus lorsque la présentation du plat inclus de la coriandre. Je fais partie de ceux et celles qui trouvent que ça goûte le savon, alors je suis toujours un peu déçue de m'en faire servir à mon insu et de devoir trier dans mon assiette."}
{"text":"Great place for a good Benedict. Their different takes on the classic will keep you busy for a while. I've had most of them and my favorite is the one with lardons and mushrooms. Can't remember the name. The staff is also very friendly. I don't know if it is common practice, but they comped my friends meal for her birthday. I recommend this place to anyone from singles to families. If you get there when they open there's no line. But if they've been open for a half hour or so you'll likely find a line. Even in the dead of winter. But that says something about how good it is."}
{"text":"Excellente place pour les dejeuners et brunch! Tant la qualité que l'endroit en lui meme! Vous en aurez pour votre argent...les plats sont difficiles à terminer!
Seul point négatif: un fort line up! Victime de leur succes."}
{"text":"What a nice place for a brunch! The ambiance is very vital with colorful painting on the wall and cute decorations. The menu is very creative! I laughed out loud when I saw \"your granny\" in the menu. The volume of food is quite big. As a big fun of Benedict egg, I ordered \"steak & eggs\". It didn't let me down! The service was good. However the space between tables is so small, which made feel a little bit crowdy."}
{"text":"This place is always popular with like 1 hour line up if you go there for brunch, at 10am or after. We went with a group of 7, and we spent 1.5 hour lining up.

Yet, they serve pretty quick and the service is still good. We didnt eat in a rush and the quality of food is very good.

We ordered: 
Beautiful truffle - recommend to share among two or three people. Truffle omelette is flavorful and there were loads of different mushrooms.

Duck benedict - love their benefit pouched egg. Duck is well cooked but its not for everyone. For me,  it's a bit dry but my friends love it. Order it if you love duck!

Service:  friendly and helpful staff, that's how they keep their customers to stay in line even they have to wait for 1 hour"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for Eggs Benedict, they make it just the right way. The only downside is that it is a pretty popular choice for brunch during the weekends and there is almost always a long waiting line. However, if you by any chance have a free weekday morning you should definitely check out this place. The decor is great, friendly service and good food. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Me and my gf love this place for breakfast! We came so much the last time we were here the staff started treating us like regulars. We plan to come every time we are in town for sure. The service is awesome and you always get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. Very lively, lots of choices. Huge portions. You can share! Really enjoyed this place for breakfast.  Come early before it's super busy."}
{"text":"Went to L'Avenue on Sunday morning (Jan. 29th, 2012). We had read reviews about it before going, so we picked up on the \"Don't Go Too Late\" advice....

We purposefully went early. Left the house at 8:00am and got to the resto at about 8:50am. No line, No wait, No one was there yet. As expected they did get a lot busier as time passed. We saw them turn a few people away. 

Our meals were great. We had no complaints. My husband really enjoyed his dish, as did I. The fruit skewers are a big bonus. Their potatoes are specially seasoned. They eggs were great along with everything else.

I would have *loved* to try a fruit smoothie, but at $6.95 a pop, I decided to skip. 

For those who get upset by the wait: For this restaurant, you either need to EXPECT a line up and don't give 'em flack for having to wait, OR you go super EARLY. The place is very popular & well-known, weekends are the busiest days, and they don't have ample seating space - so it makes sense that when they are busy there are line-ups."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch worth the wait! Fresh fruit, fresh squeezed juices! Eggs Benedict was delicious too!"}
{"text":"easily the BEST place for brunch in Montreal.
Insane line-ups going out the door on weekends so be prepared to wait. The food is just out of this world, while they have many breakfast and brunch classics like Eggs Benedict, pancakes, french toast and waffles, they usually have original twists on them to, for instance Eggs Benedict with chorizo sausages instead of ham.
Try this place at least once and I guarantee, you'll never want to do brunch anywhere else!"}
{"text":"You remember that one kid from high school, right?  The one that you wanted to hate but were secretly envious of?  You know, the senior that could throw a football like nobody's business and was nice to freshman and once said hi to you in the hallway.  If you asked people to describe him all they would just shake their heads and quietly mutter, \"That guy is so fucking cool.\"  Restaurant L'avenue is that kid, if that kid were a restaurant and served breakfast all day.

The decor of the place, the waiters, even the fucking bathrooms were so effortlessly cool that I wanted to hate the restaurant, but gave it my money instead.  We got spinach/chevre eggs benedict and a kiwi/strawberry pain dore.  This place seemed to be very french canadian in that everyone in it was speaking french, but the portions were very American in that they were stupidly large.  There must have been half a loaf of bread in the pain dore, and the eggs benedict came with potatoes and a fruit skewer.  Everything was perfectly cooked, the waiters were attentive, and we weren't rushed to leave, even as the place filled up to capacity.

If you get here after 9 AM, you're going to be waiting in line.  Get up early, indulge in a very large, very decadent breakfast, and then walk out afterwards muttering, \"That place is so fucking cool.\""}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Everyone had such a nice time, the only thing is the line to eat does start to form because of how popular and small the place is. Since My friends and I went during brunch the food was somewhat limited for vegans. However, I chose the veggie burrito, and it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"Okay, so this was one gem of a brunch place we found while visiting the Jean talon farmer's market. This restaurant is walkable from the market and had the longest and slowest moving lines! But we were so glad we waited and were patient!
The food was phenomenal and so was the service! 
The menu choices are enormous for a brunch and there are mix and match of savory and sweet items too!
We stuck to the basics and ordered eggs benedict and savory truffle french toast with mushrooms. We also got a strawberry and watermelon cocktail and a matcha vanilla milkshake. I guess everyone gets a fruit skewer to begin with and in another 5 minutes or so we had our drinks. Our drinks were really refreshing and delicious. 
The food also arrived quickly and I cannot fully justify how good the Benedict were in writing! It was the perfect poach accompanied by super delish hollandaise sauce! And the side of roasted potatoes were to die for!! My husband also loved his french toast!
Our server was super nice and I totally would come here again!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Montreal! Try to arrive early, as you will most likely to be caught in a line up. Trust me, it's not fun in COLD weather! However, the wait is worth it. The breakfast is always made to perfection. So YUMMY. Their smoothies are really good too! Also, you MUST visit the bathroom. It's so funky! Great place to go with friends/family. Would recommend to ALL!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for about an hour and felt like my feet were about to fall off but it was totally worth it. 
I had the Benedict - smoked meat eggs benedict and it was absolutely amazing. Probably the best eggs benedict I've ever had. The potatos were alright, I wish they were a little bit crispier. The portions are pretty generous and come with a skewer of unpeeled fruit (I am the type to struggle with this so it made me a bit sad).
The cafe mocha was on the sweet side, but thats exactly how I like it. 
Overall, it's a really great place for brunch."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Montreal this is our go to Brunch spot. The food is always so fresh, comes out on time, the waited staff quick, courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Amazing service and very clean! Everyone is very polite and kind. Walking in I was greeted and welcomed. Very accomplished training"}
{"text":"Très bon brunch avec un très bon service.  
Je le conseille. (note particulière pour les toilettes)"}
{"text":"No lines!! No one!! Love this L'Avenue location.

We were seated right away for breakfast brunch on a weekday. 

My friend willingly to share an order of Egg Benedict with me. Thanks so much! I still have nightmares about my last visit when no one wanted to share anything with me and I ended up being so stuffed and could not even think about eating until dinner time!

Love the option for a split order with an additional $2.50 charge, you can have your own fruit skewer and potato.

Everything was perfect from the food to the service.

A truly 5 star experience without the price tag!"}
{"text":"I have to apologize to my table mate and friends. I just could not stop rolling my eyes when you just could not decide what to order at Restaurant l'avenue.

I could not blame you all when I suggested we should just order a mixture of some breakfast/brunch items and SHARE... and you all told me you were hungry and could eat a horse or the whole thing by yourself. But you never read all these Yelp reviews nor see any of the photos... 

And on top you all ordered a Smoothie each?! I know that smoothie alone would have filled you all up without actually eating any real food...

But....

Egg Benedicts were all done perfectly with such cute plating. Oh and those fresh fruit skewers.. They were staring at all these food...and we don't even have enough space on the table to fit all these food...

Enormous Servings of Comfort food perfect for sharing. 

You know Sharing means Caring... But I didn't blame them, they didn't know what they were getting into.... 

The wait was not that bad 20 minute tops on a weekday...yes it definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The best brunch I've ever had. I ordered the duck confit eggs benedict and it was superb, the hollandaise sauce was the best I've had. Even their potatoes had something special to it. My friend ordered the french toast and it was insanely good as well. I must go back and order something else on the menu. Service, atmosphere, and even the bathroom is pretty cool. You leave L'Avenue happy and full, totally worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Line This.

                  Allow me to confirm the rumours, I would rather stick a fork in my eye than wait in line for breakfast. My first attempt at L'avenue for brunch was on a Saturday at around noon...the line was almost down the block....psssshhhhffftttt...next. The second time was on a Sunday at around 11:30...line...next.

     Third times a charm. I was up early on a Sunday, not sure why, and made it there for about 10:30. No line, I was seated right away. I then had the pleasure of watching the madness develop as I sipped my morning Mojito. Within 20 minutes the place was crammed like the new guy on 'C' block and a line had formed outside.

      Their breakfast menu is vast...in point of fact...the menu is vast but I was there for one reason...Hollandaise. My server, despite my many attempts to converse in my mother tongue, refused to speak to me in English, which was disappointing but the sauce made up for it.

    I had the steak and eggs Benedicty thingamajig, it was awesome. Smothered in a beautiful nappe Hollandaise with poached eggs that broke and ran like Ben Johnson. 

      Their home fries had a nice bite to them, the portions were huge and the fruit brochette they sent us to start was pretty dang fresh. You can see the Sri Lankan guy making them in the window, if you decide to wait in line....but you would have to be bat shit crazy to wait in line, outside for breakfast in Montreal.

 Reasonably priced, uni-lingual, delicious but not worth the wait.

{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast restaurants in Montreal, this place doesn't disappoint and deserves its high rating. I've tried many different meals and have never been disappointed. The plates are huge so try to split and share them if you can. The burgers are my personal favorite and they are really yummy."}
{"text":"Clairement la meilleurs place à brunch que j'ai essayé dans tout Mtl."}
{"text":"Le meilleur brunch de Montréal

Oui je proclame L'Avenue comme étant le meilleur brunch de tout Montréal. Et à y réfléchir, je dirai même le meilleur brunch de ma vie. 

Aucune réservation possible, s'applique la loi du \"premier arrivé, premier servi\". Toujours le line-up à l'entrée, mais bon ça vaut définitivement le coup de patienter. Une fois à l'intérieur, un autre univers s'ouvre à toi. Un mur en briques recouvert de graffitis colorés, une moto et un scooter suspendus juste au-dessus des tables, de la musique vive et rythmée. Et le clou du spectacle: des toilettes éclairées à la lumière bleue dont les murs sont aussi recouverts de graffitis.

À revoir: Les serveurs sont pressés et peu aimables, et l'attente pour être servi est scandaleuse. 

Le menu peut s'apparenter à un livre, compte au moins 10 minutes pour assimiler. Beaucoup de choix, tous plus appétissants les uns que les autres. Et quand enfin vient le moment de déguster, c'est la consécration (considérant le nombre d'épreuves pour y parvenir). Un effort notable est fait sur la vaisselle de tendance moderne et sur le dressage des mets tout en relief, ce qui décuple l'envie. Un positionnement plutôt rare: les plats offrent de la quantité ET de la qualité, non mais c'est fou ça ! Tout est succulent et en toute saison, même les fruits (dans une région où les fruits sont insipides, ça relève carrément de l'exploit). Des associations osées, des goûts marqués, des assaisonnements équilibrés. J'apprécie particulièrement les pommes de terre rissolées bien relevées qui sont un exemple pour la société.  

Mon coup de coeur: \"Steak & eggs\" 2 oeufs Oméga 3 pochés, émincé de steak de bavette Angus Black et champignons réduit dans une sauce chateaubriand et nappé d'hollandaise épicée, accompagnés de patates rissolées avec brochette de fruits.

Mon astuce: Pour éviter la foule et le bruit, arrive après 14h30.

{"text":"Gerry, the foodiest concierge I've ever met who steered us 100% well (thank you, Intercontinental Montreal) was not lying. This was magnifique. I can see why it gets such glowing reviews. Its a vast menu with regular hearty breakfast/brunch fare ... and then the twists and turns. I had the wild mushroom lardon benedict and it was so multilayered with flavors. Even the potatoes were seasoned beautifully with a buttery texture. My partners also had benedicts. People around us ordered French toast and waffles that looked delicious too. Portions are gigantic. Everything comes with a fruit kebab that is generous and tasty. I had a mango/lychee juice that turned out to be blended with ice in a huge bowl with a party umbrella. Fantastic service. Cute place. Off the beaten path from the regular tourist hubs. I will be back on my next visit."}
{"text":"HOLY S**T! This restaurant is amazing. Been here a couple of times and always recommend this place for breakfast lovers and those who have a massive appetite in Montreal. Ordered the chocolate pancakes and what I got was a mashup of 3 large pancakes drizzled in chocolate sauce, with bananas on the side. For the first time in my life I can say that I was unable to finish the meal. Decided to take a trip to the bathroom and ended up wanting to stay there for hours! Glow in the dark paint, lights off with a movie playing both on the floor and on the wall. I ended up taking multiple selfies and watching Tropic Thunder for 20 minutes. I did not want to leave the bathroom, as weird as that sounds. 

Great service, very friendly staff and although there was over an hour wait to get into the restaurant, the food was worth waiting for."}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch place in Montreal with the best eggs Benedict. I've tried duck Benedict in several places, none can top theirs!"}
{"text":"Worth the intimidating wait. Just have one of your friends go next door to get coffee! Had the duck confit Benedict with some potatoes and sex hasn't been the same since."}
{"text":"This place was OK.....I feel that I was \"fooled\" by other reviews.  I am not sure if this is because I come from NYC and have experienced  similar and better places or if it was the 45 minute wait in the FREEZING cold....which as some have stated as being \"worth it\", I beg to differ.  The place was cute inside, with your regular \"funky/hip\" decor.  Food was tasty.  A little too heavy, but tasty.  Service was a little slow and inconsistent, however the plus side is that our waitress did warn us that there are only 2 of them on duty.  This was appreciated.

Word of advice to the owners, INVEST IN AN ENGLISH MENU!!!,  obviously this place is not just for locals since Yelp is doing it's job in bringing business.  And also, you may want to do something about the people waiting outside in the freezing cold.  Maybe offer some coffee, or at the very least provide some heat lamps outside."}
{"text":"I wish Toronto had a place like this.

It's fun, eclectic, filling and well priced.

Great food, presentation and a fun ambience make brunch mandatory at this Montreal-must."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch while visiting Montréal after looking on Yelp. This place had one of the highest reviews. We got in line just in time before it got too crazy (before 10am). The menu was in french only, so I brushed up on some of my high school french to make out what was on the menu. The decor in the restaurant was unique. They gave us a fruit \"appetizer\" which resembled a fruit kabob. It was good. We got one of their mixed fruity drinks/smoothie, which tasted good but nothing memorable. I liked that their water was watermelon infused, it tasted refreshing. 

*Disclaimer* I think I'm a little spoiled since there are many fantastic brunch places in Philly. 

I had a very tasty french toast topped with fresh fruit! One of us got the cappuccino which was rich and came with a small piece of chocolate. We ordered  several savory brunch dishes which was good but again nothing too memorable. The service was just okay. I think one of the most memorable things was strangely their blue lit creepy bathroom. We saw several people go in at once to take pictures. It was unique... but again slightly creepy. 

Despite not being too impressed, I had a decent experience. I will probably not come back again since I don't regularly visit Montréal. If I come back, I will probably explore some other brunch places in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Lots of food selection. Would highly recommend this place. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Usually when you see incredible long line outside a restaurant you tell yourself \"ok this is the new hype\" but this is place is the exception. People are standing outside in line even in winter and its not for nothing.
The food is outstanding, huge portions (I always split with my wife and we both are full at the end) and the quality is outstanding. I gave it a 4 star and not 5 only because the long lines take some out of the experience. Try the amazing natural shakes, out of this world egg benedicts and outstanding pancakes. This is the place for brunch in Montreal."}
{"text":"Sometimes it gets loud and the waiters have a hard time understanding the order if you are speaking in English (a French companion can help).
The food has been glorious every single time. We once waited over an hour (as a group of 6) the day after New Years in below -10 degrees Celsius weather. That's how committed we are to this place. 

I usually order an omelette with special additions (spinach, bell peppers, ...) and it's no trouble.
Since my first time, I have brought non-breakfast people, family friends, boyfriend's family, and they have all returned multiple times (without me which I find hurtful!)

When a young cousin came to visit for Osheaga, I took her here. Her favorite band and main reason for attending Osheaga had posted a photo to Instagram from the bathroom of L'Avenue earlier that day. It was celebrity and Gen-approved."}
{"text":"Agree with all other reviews. Delicious. Nice skewer of fresh fruit to start. Can't believe no one mentioned the bathrooms. Definitely be sure to use the facilities."}
{"text":"I was a disappointed with the food at L'Avenue.  I had the duck eggs benedict.  The eggs were perfectly cooked, and the hollandaise was delicious, but overall, I found the dish too heavy.  I also tasted the huevos rancheros, which was good, but not amazing.  It did have a nice cumin flavor to it.  Both dishes reminded me of a big step up from diner food, which is not my idea of an amazing breakfast.  
We waited 30 minutes outside for a table on Tuesday, and then waited another 20 to order any food!  That drove me nuts.  The waitress was friendly, but it seemed overwhelmed. 
They do serve fruit on a skewer to everyone, which is a nice touch.  Would I do all that driving to get there, waiting in line, and waiting to get the food they serve?  Nope.  It's just not worth it to me.  But if you like hearty breakfasts, and you like them with extra large milkshakes, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Après plusieurs visites, je suis toujours aussi FAN de l'Avenue : 
Mes véritables coups de coeur : Le frappé à l'oréo, Les oeufs bénédictines Steak & Eggs, les pancakes fraise & nutella

déçu !"}
{"text":"Wait? What wait? 

So let me start by saying: expect to wait. For like, an hour and a half. Outside. In the elements. 

Now let me continue by saying, once you do make it inside, and that food touches your lips... I swear it's sprinkled with mermaid kisses and instant amnesia dust. That wait because ancient history. 

I went with a group of about 8 for a friend of mines birthday (that was actually the entire reason I was in Montreal to begin with) and we found this place on Yelp! We already knew about the long line so we decided to take it in shifts. A few people would wait while the rest would wonder and explore. So we make it inside after waiting for a little over an hour, and wait a pleasant surprise. The decor is super fun, colorful, and full of American satire. The menu, like most things in Montreal is in French but the waitress, Elise I believe her name was, she was a doll! She explained and translated everything. Everyone on my party ordered different variations of the egg Benedict. I have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful yep beautiful for breakfast/brunch ever. 

We went on to enjoy or food and two bottles of champagne we ordered for mimosas. I'm going to assume Elise overheard our convo about the birthday celebration because at the end of the meal she brought out a complimentary round of shots! What a sweetie! This place was amazing! The food was ridiculously delicious, the service was impeccable, and the setting was trendy yet cozy. If I lived in the area or visit Montreal again I will absolutely going back. 

ps. The bathrooms are crazy trippy!"}
{"text":"This place is legit delish. Menu is on the larger side but, there's a good mix of sweet and savory to rev those taste buds. Eat it all up. 

Tasty blueberry and basil mimosa to start, along with a cup of coffee. The water they serve is infused in a huge container with watermelon. Their brown bread and homemade sausage is a homerun for sure.

So, about the bathroom sich that everyone speaks of... yep - it's pretty darn cool. Loaded with graffiti and a black light to set the mood. And then there's that clock project where the minute hand is erased every single minute and drawn again. Pretty cool
concept and definitely a cool vibe. 

One thing to note - we came here on a Friday morning and in line for about 45 minutes. So, if you don't have a bit of time to kill, you might want to wait until you do. 

Go here. Enjoy the food. Enjoy the vibe."}
{"text":"Best breakfast food ever.

Omelets , panacakes, there were 4 of us and we couldnt even get up to leave."}
{"text":"Got the salmon eggs benedict and they were really good. They give a skewer of fruits before the main dish comes out and it was a really nice addition. My only complain that there was a little too much going on that at a point, the benedicts just tasted like a mash of stuff, as in I couldn't distinguish a flavor. But as a brunch, probably the best spot you can go to. Menu is only in french so had to ask the waiter to explain in english!"}
{"text":"Super overrated. I don't get the hype at all. The city is full of amazing food and we left unimpressed."}
{"text":"Pendant des années, me promenant sur le long de la rue Mont-Royal, je remarquais une longue file près du resto l'Avenue en me demandant toujours pourquoi elle était si longue. Ne vous inquiétez pas! Ça n'est pas à cause d'un service lent, mais plutôt d'un des meilleurs brunch de la ville. Ça en vaut l'attente.

J'y ai goûté les mets salés et sucrés qui en sont aussi bon les uns que les autres. Lemenu est tellement varié que j'ai eu un peu de diffidultée à décider quoi prendre."}

Vraiment je recommande !'"}
{"text":"To sum up my experience: Out of this WORLD!

Came here on a Friday morning, around 10. For my party of two we probably waited 30 minutes. Yes it was outside in the cold - but YES YES DOUBLE YES it was worth it. 

Upon being sat, my sister & I were overwhelmed at the menu. There's atleast 10 different benedicts to choose from (I was in Benedict heaven), tons of omelettes, sweet pancake/French toast options (& not your typical sweet flavors - all very unique), and much more. 

Oh - & the drinks. Fresh juices, fun coffee combinations (Nutella?!), milkshakes, teas. 

We went with 2 matcha lattes, the traditional Benedict for me, the veggie goat cheese Benedict for my sister, and 2 carrot cake CREAM CHEESE icing pancakes. Just gained 5lbs typing that. You also get a fruit skewer to start - a simple, but appreciated, touch. 

The lattes were unbelievable, benedicts to die for & the carrot cake wheat pancakes had me melting in my chair. 

Also - their normal pancake entree comes with 4 pancakes.. not to be taken lightly. You can ask for just 1.. or 2.. or 3 as a side to your entree, if you need that sweet + salty mix

All in all.. don't miss this stop!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place rocks! I came by on a Tuesday morning, off of a recommendation from a local, and had to wait about 30 minutes. I don't think I've ever waited at a brunch restaurant on a weekday (that's how I knew it must be really good). 

The menu is both incredible to look at (just trust me) and full of way too many incredible looking food options. It was so hard to decide! I ended up getting the fruity breakfast- two eggs, bacon, French toast, fresh fruit, potatoes, and a toasted baguette. It was so much food! The French toast was so buttery, and honestly the best of my life. PLEASE order their French toast!!! The potatoes are so flavorful and delicious. They serve real maple syrup in a can and a really fun fruity jam for the toast. Everything was flawless! Literally my only complaint would be that I got too much fruit haha 

Everyone I was with was so thrilled with their food - it's 300% worth the wait! It was also shockingly cheap for how much food we got- such a good deal!"}
{"text":"In Montreal for the week with family. We decided to get some breakfast and looked this place up. I ordered the Classic Eggs Benedict which was amazing. The service was also great since we didn't really speak French that well and they were extremely helpful!"}
{"text":"We got here just before a comically long and slow moving line formed behind us. Consider that my view of this place isn't tempered by the hour-long wait some of you might endure if you attempt a walk-in at peak hours.

This place is totally packed, and they'll cram you in like sardines to make full use of their space. The steak and eggs benedict are phenomenal, though service is overworked, and therefore a bit spotty. We kept getting lucky, but I couldn't help but notice the couple that came before us didn't get their food until after we were done with ours.

Seems like this place is in dire need of an expansion to a larger space, though maybe I'm missing the point of a popular brunch spot. Maybe to some people it's only worth it for the exclusivity."}
{"text":"Line control is a disaster...you can have equally good brunch somewhere else without waiting for hours in the freezing cold..."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant right after my flight landed into Montreal on a Thursday morning. I was seated immediately. I got the Nutella pancakes and while the dish was amazing, it was overkill for just 1 person. It was way to sweet so I decided to get scrambled eggs with bacon and cheese. Weirdly, the scrambled eggs came with bacon strips on the side and a few slices of cheese on the side also, not cooked into the eggs but okay.. On Saturday morning, I wanted to visit this restaurant again before I left Montreal. I arrived around 11am and there was a line around the block! It was cold so I wasn't going to wait but I was really disappointed. If you are visiting on a Saturday, be aware of the long lines."}
{"text":"The brunch here is a game changer!!! We ordered the steak and eggs Benedict and it was amazing. Perfectly cooked steak strips and seasoned with a ton of flavor. The poached egg on top was cooked perfectly with this sweet tangy orange hollandaise sauce. We were so impressed! Can't wait to come back already. 

Also the best part, free fruit skewers with every meal. I am a sucker for freebies. And the fact that it's healthy, is an even bigger bonus! 

I still day dream about this place. I gotta start planning my return trip to Montreal already!"}
{"text":"This place is THE place to get brunch in Montreal! It's famous down there - and for a good reason! The service is exceptional, with the staff being super friendly and welcoming, as well as the food/drinks coming quickly and efficiently. The general layout of the place is beautiful as well, with brightly colored decor (including mannequins!) all around - and I won't say much, but the bathroom is probably the coolest bathroom I've seen. Then, the most important thing: the food. Though this place definitely specializes more in sweet brunches/breakfasts, the menu is large, and there is definitely something for everyone. Between the drinks and the food, everyone at my table of four thoroughly enjoyed their meals, and the next time I'm back in Montreal, I'll definitely be hitting this place up again! Just as a general note - come early! The line up for this place spans out the door and around the block, so the earlier the better."}
{"text":"WOWOWOWOWOW!!!!!

Beautiful place! Decor on point! There's a motorcycle on the wall!!! How cool is that??? 

Waiiiiiit you're not here for the decor are you? Here's how my food experience was : 
Food is good! The Smoked Salmon was a delish! Not too dry, right how it should be. The Bobby does Dallas was #2, I'd recommend the smoked salmon over the Bobby does Dallas. It had too many mushrooms in my opinion. The juice from the mushrooms was the main taste that you get while chewing but still a unique taste! 

By the way, EXPECT TO WAIT OUTSIDE BEFORE GETTING A TABLE. Even before noon... That tells a lot about this place right? I will definitely come back (so my girlfriend can visit the bathroom which I heard is really beautiful... but yeah! She forgot to go see how it looked like last time so I have to go back)."}
{"text":"this was our first stop after entering montreal and what a great way to be welcomed! the cafe has a amy winehouse (yet not as dirty) - rock - individualistic vibe to it and the decor is off the wall, from hanging disco lights to male and female buddha figures on the bathroom doors. the food was just as awesome, even though my husband and i only had half an idea of what we were actually ordering, since the menu was in french. he got the shrimp omelette which was DELISHHHH maximus, and i got the meat platter, with bacon, ham, some kind of french sausage, eggs, french toast, pancakes and some kind of minced thing that had the consistency of spread. we're not quite sure what it was. every dish comes with a little pot of roasted potatoes and they were yummy!!! \"best potatoes i've ever had\", proclaims my food snob husband :) this was probably the best breakfast we've ever had. no exaggeration."}
{"text":"The hype is real and well deserved - this is the Best brunch spot in Montreal IMO! The atmosphere is very lively and energetic. Friendly bilingual staff. Large portions. Fast service (not rushed). 

I'd recommend:
-  arriving early, before 10am (luckily i didn't have to wait because i needed a table for 1, but by the time i left ~11am there was a long line out the door! So dress warmly!)
- the steak & eggs Benedict : AMAZING! The meat was so flavorful and well made!! Can't wait to try this again"}
{"text":"This place is so fun! The apples cheddar bacon sauce is incredible on the pancakes. I've never had a anything like it before. Sweet but not too much with the richness of the bacon and cheese. Awesome wait staff too"}
{"text":"I must say, waiting 45 minuets in the extreme cold was worth every minute!!! I'm gonna actually say, this just might be one of the best breakfast I have ever had hands down !  Sat in a very comfortable booth for four.  Immediately our waitress offered coffee which was delicious and pipping hot.  My daughter had a cappuccino!  I ordered the mushroom lardo Benny.  2 poached eggs on a English muffin topped with The best hollandaise sauce ever.  Came with breakfast potatoes that not only cooked perfectly but seasoned even better !!  My husband had the steak and eggs benny.  The same thing, tender pieces of beef smothered with the perfect hollandaise !  My kids got the \"I'll take it all\". Eggs, toast, potato's french toast, pancake sausage bacon, and a few more things.  Huge. Totally huge !! All dishes come with a skewer of fresh fruit!  Professional top notch service, friendly staff, and absolutely fantastic food!  Perfect combination!  They do it well !  And that my friends is why the crowd lines up! Bravo"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning and had eggs, sausage, and pankakes. Pankakes were nice and fluffy served with real maple syrup. Eggs and sausage were just right, lets be honest eggs should be straight forward and so they were. The side patatoes were very tasty and different from the usual breakfast patatoes served everywhere else. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Holy Wow, the breakfast at L'avenue is ridiculously good.  The pancakes!!! I don't even like pancakes, but the pancakes were amazing.  And wow, their potatoes, I've been craving them for two days now.  The menu is in French with no English descriptions, and they blast loud electropop music, this isn't a spot to come have brunch while recovering from a hangover.  We went on a Sunday morning, there was a line, and there is no room to wait for a table inside the restaurant, so be warned you'll have to wait outside for 15-20 minutes dress accordingly during inclement weather.  PANCAKES AND POTATOES!!"}
{"text":"What a popular place! We got here and there was a line out the door. I walked in, just to see what the wait was for two, but we were able to be seated right away! The place is very cramped, Scooting into my seat i almost knocked over water of table next to me (big butt say wut). Anyways, menu was pretty decent, they are known for Benedict's. Girlfriend ordered the duck Benedict, unfortunately she was left very displeased. There was practically no duck, it consisted of 85% sauteed onions. By the time she was done,(only ate one portion, picked through the other) her plate was full of onions. I ordered the smoked meat Benedict. It was ok for the first few bites, but it just seemed to get saltier and saltier, i couldn't finish my second second either. Best part of the experience was the bathroom and the potatoes. I'd order something different if i came again."}
{"text":"Loud music, slow service, high pricing and often (in my experience) disappointing food.  The portions are great, the avenue view at the rear is nice and the menus are cool, but who lines up for this ish?  Seriously, after the last time going there, I've decided to deny the hype.  Unless you've got time and money to spare, I would recommend going to any of the lower-key breakfast joints around town.  You won't have to wait forty minutes to get your eat on and you won't be disappointed when your $12 plate is underwhelming.  

I'm calling it out: this place is overrated.  There are so many restaurants that you don't have to line up for that offer superior service and better deals."}

{"text":"Our Montreal friends took us here for brunch on our last day in the city. It was great! The decor is funky, the service was friendly, and the portions were ridiculously huge and delicious! I got a crepe with scrambled eggs, bacon, cheddar, and mushrooms and it was sooo good. The home fries were the bomb! My husband got a \"Bobby visite L'Espagne\" and that was awesome too. My food was a little less hot than it could have been because they waited to bring all our orders out at the same time. And there was a long wait to get seated, as is usual at popular establishments like this during peak brunch hours. Other than that, a big thumbs-up to this place!"}
{"text":"I really don't think I've ever had a better breakfast that I've had at L'Avenue.  The Eggs Benedict is TO DIE FOR.  And the smoothies?  Even in the dead of winter, I've never tasted something so perfectly ripe.  Insanity all around.  Dinner is also good, but perhaps not as amazing as breakfast.  

Also, gotta appreciate the bathrooms with the disco ball and movies in the floor.  

The only bummer: waiting in line for that breakfast.  But worth every minute."}
{"text":"The eggs benedict! oh my god the eggs benedict! absolutely scrumptious. Great service."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Worth the wait in the long line you will most likely stand in outside! If you're starving there is an Asian food stand right next to you. Get a couple potstickers (1$) to hold you over! I love that they bring you a fruit skewer while you wait for your food! It's delicious and the perfect appetizer. They serve a brunch all day! The food was amazing! The seating was a little tight! I highly recommend the carrot cake pancake, any of the Benedicts (their hollandaise sauce is great!)"}
{"text":"Get the French toast with Nutella, bananas, coconut, and rum sauce. One of the best things I've ever eaten! Definitely get there early or you will be waiting in a line outside the building for quite some time...but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Surestimé en général (pas de quoi faire un lineup). Les déjeuners sont copieux, riches, mais le café était infect; un cappuccino pas de mousse n'est pas un cappuccino. Je l'ai retourné et on m'en a reservi un tel quel. J'ai été parler au barista (unilingue anglophone) qui ne m'a simplement pas répondu. En tous cas. Mes amis ont quand même aimé le brunch et leur café, donc ça doit pas être si pire que ça."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!! This place is amazing! Between the food, service and atmosphere you can't go wrong here. 

Eats:
- Steak and egg Benedict with garlic potatoes.....amazing. The special sauce with the poached egg added to the flavor of the angus steak. I would highly recommend it to the steak and Benedict lover. Side of potatoes and garlic was great to dip in whatever sauce was left
- my wife had the Shakshuka which a middle Eastern inspired dish with sausage, peppers, poached eggs and sauce in the middle of a huge round warm bread. 
- both dishes came with a side of fresh fruit in a skewer 

Drinks:
- Latte was really good served in a big cup
- house water was good and refreshing. It's served from a large dispenser with several pieces of fresh cut watermelon

Likes: 
- service is really good
- house water is good
- menu is huge with lots of unique things to choose from
- prices are reasonable for the portion you get
- atmosphere is cool and the bathroom even and a cool look to it 
- Great spot for breakfast 

Overall I don't have any complaints about l'avenue. I would definetelly come back again for brunch."}
{"text":"When you search for brunch in Montreal there is an overwhelming laundry list of options. L'Avenue is regularly at the top of each list so I made it a point to visit on a recent trip to Montreal. We arrived around 9am on a Sunday and the line was out the door. There were numerous other open restaurants in the area but all of them appeared to be empty. This was apparently the place to be and ended up waiting about 45 minutes for a group of five. The menu was huge and featured pretty much any breakfast option you could think of including omelets, French toast, bagels, huevos rancheros, shakshuka, breakfast poutine, and so on. It was overwhelming and difficult to decide what to order because I wanted to try everything. I eventually settled on the Duck Benedict with was phenomenal! The toasted English muffins were topped with perfectly yolky poached eggs, tender duck confit, sweet caramelized onions, and flavorful grained mustard hollandaise sauce. The side of roasted potatoes was savory and filling. The dish was huge and, unfortunately, I could not physically finish everything. Overall, one of the best breakfast/brunch restaurants I have ever visited."}
{"text":"The best eggs benedict I've ever had.

I've been here at least a dozen times.  Whether you're hungover or not, the brunch is unreal.  The flavour is shocking, the price as well as the  portions are more than reasonable and the decor beyond avant-garde.  I love this place, and I will recommend always this place for any meal of the day.  

Avec ou sans la gueule de bois, ce resto est plus que génial.  Soyez prêt à attendre en avant, c'est toujours rempli de clients fidèle.  Les repas sont bien faits, grands et délicieux.  Le service amiable montre une chaleur typique de Montréal, c'est à dire un peu froid pour les étrangers! (Seulement si l'on ne fait pas un effort en Français.) 

Ce resto vaut votre argent et votre temps.  En allez-vous!"}
{"text":"Always so good. Eggs Benedict and amazing sweet brunches too. Such funky decor and washrooms and a really cool place when you are in the mood for a \"popping\" brunch with lots of people, music & sometimes line-ups (weekends). Would recommend for groups or couples wanting a fun time, not who want a chill vibe."}
{"text":"I got the Indecisive and a green smoothie for breakfast. It was a lot of food, but so delicious that I couldn't stop. I would suggest this place for anyone hoping for a brunch filled with amazing flavor. We did have to wait a few minutes for our table, but nothing significant. I would go back every morning if I could."}
{"text":"TL;DR: 

POTATOES

Worth the money
Worth the calories
Worth the wait
Worth to die for POTATOES 

-0.5 star for the longgg wait. 

+1 star for the cute decors

+1 star for attentive service

+1 star for the complementary fruit skewers!

+1000 stars for the duck egg benedict - Herb potatoes that comes with it is the best POTATOES ever that ever entered my mouth. OMG it's that good. I wrote this review 2 months after my dining experience there yet I can still taste the buttery, herb scent of the potatoes. It's heavenly. The duck is a little too sweet for my liking but it is still perfectly cooked. Egg-cellent perfectly cooked eggs.

+1 star for huge breakfast portion - could easily be 2 meals but with empty stomach this can be done

Did I make sure to mention POTATOES??

PS: Come here hungry (but not cranky) - make sure to come early or else it could be 1+ hour wait. 

Now, go get that POTATOES and thank me later!
You're welcome."}
{"text":"Je situe le décors: à votre droite un mur de briques apparentes, tagué, sur lequel est fixée une moto, un peu plus loin à gauche, deux vélos Lenus, à gagner après avoir rempli un questionnaire de satisfaction... Nous avons la chance d'être installés sur des canapés en arc de cercle très confortables et un serveur bout en train, vient prendre notre commande. Ce sera ma deuxième expérience d'oeufs bénédictes. Je choisi les bénédictines \"tout le monde à poêle\" ou \"tout le monde tout nu\" d'après notre gentil serveur! Ils sont agrémentés de bacon, de champignons noirs et de roquette. J'insiste sur un fait qui a déjà été relevé par d'autres yelpeurs: Les portions sont ÉNORMES...Je me régale! Pour finir sur une note sucrée nous partageons une assiette de pancakes tout aussi copieuse, aux fraises, bananes et bleuets. Nous sortons la panse bien remplie!"}
{"text":"Okay so we're not going to have egss Benedict anywhere else except here and that's a fact. Honestly they might have not invented this here but they sure have perfected it. The service is also very exceptional and friendly to match the hip atmosphere and great food"}
{"text":"I'm glad I decided to go on a rainy day because the line was still super long. I waited almost an hour before my party of 3 was seated. As we were waiting on line, looking at the diners, my friends and I were judging a girl cause she left her drink 90% untouched. We soon learned why....we ordered the french toast and one omelette dish with 2 smoothies and grapefruit juice. The portions seem small through pictures but they are HUGE. The smoothie alone is a meal. I've never come across a french toast I couldn't finish.....no matter how much I ate, the portions didn't seem to decrease. L'Avenue defeated us. Side note, but the bathroom is super cool and the toilet paper glows in the dark so it's a fun selfie spot. I would definitely return but order less."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 rather than a 4 star.

The food was good but this place doesn't live up to the hype at all. We waited 45 minutes to be seated which we are used to from all the brunch spots in Melbourne but after we were done with the meal and asked ourselves \"was it worth the wait\" ... no it wasn't.

The food was above average for sure comparative to the very very weak brunch scene in Canada. But there was nothing in the menu that was note worthy, just the standard brunch variety, but done a little better; add a few \"unique ingredients\" and call it a menu. 

Their benedict tasted good but quickly became dull and repetitive with each subsequent bite. The coffee was good but once again not something worth waiting for. 

Overall I'd say this restaurant doesn't give the wow factor a 45minute wait commands but if the wait isn't an issue this place is still a great place for a regular brunch meal!"}
{"text":"I finally went back to L'Avenue after a 3 year absence and was dying to see if it changed. I will keep this review short as everything has already been said about this place: Located in pretty much the hippest area in the city. Expect a long wait, especially on weekends (even at 2PM). Funky decor with the music to match with. 

As Montrealers, we tend to take all the breakfast restaurants we have for granted. Even our breakfast chains like Cora and Eggspectation are fantastic. I lived in California for a few years and there was this IHOP near my place which was always packed...an IHOP for God' sake! It turns out that it was better than the Denny's a few blocks down the street and those were basically my only two choices without having to drive miles for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was worth the 1 hour lineup 10 years ago when there were more paid phone booths than brunch restaurants in Plateau. But time has changed- the only reason i come here is because it's my weekday morning spot within 10min from home. When it comes to weekend though, i can name a restaurant that does just a little bit better than L'avenue for each dish I've tasted here: 
Wild mushroom truffle omelette: a similar dish on Le Pain Perdu's daily special (1min walk from L'avenue) does it better - less greasy & more tasty. 
Chicken Egg Benedict: It's good but even Allo Mon Coco, the chain that's all over Montreal right now, can achieve similar result & satisfaction.
Duck Egg Benedict: Not closely as good as the one at Passe Compose or La Fabrique. 
Maybe the egg-related dishes are not their specialty? However, isn't it a all-day brunch restaurant? 
I have to admit that the service is good, price & quality ratio is great and the decoration is more funky than most of the others- especially the washroom - well worth a visit and pay attention to the clock!! :)"}
{"text":"Loved! Came with a group of girlfriends, and had a wait outside. Once inside, the restaurant was all worth. The food portions were large and delectable, and we could all only really finish half the benedicts. The bathroom is a sight to behold!"}
{"text":"On s'est cassé le bide ! C'est des fous à l'Avenue du Plateau :)

J'avais vraiment sous-estimé les quantités à l'américaine, parce qu'on a eu deux assiettes vraiment énormes ! Mais qu'est-ce que c'était bon ! 
Le pain doré (pain perdu), deux morceaux de brioche bien caramélisée à la taille indécente, avec ses bananes, son nutella et sauce sirop d'érable...
Les pancakes, 4 pancakes bien épais, bien moelleux avec beaucoup de goût, accompagnés d'une orgie de nutella, fraises fraîches et chantilly maison... LE BONHEUR.

Un peu moins quand il a fallu finir chacun son assiette. Sincèrement, ce n'était pas possible, on en a laissé un peu avec regret, mais c'était soit ça soit l'explosion.
J'aime la sucre, le gras, tout ce que vous voulez, mais là soyons honnête c'était quand même l'hyperglycémie aigue. On est rentrés (sous une pluie battante) et j'ai dormi 2h ensuite. Voilou.

Très bon cappucino avec son latte art s'il-vous-plaît, des verres énormes de fruits mixés que j'aurais souhaité avec encore plus de goût.
Un service sympa, surtout qu'en y étant allés en semaine nous avons été placés tout de suite dans un box banquette rien que nous 2 :)

Chouette déco, en particulier les toilettes, assez dingues, ne faites pas l'impasse ! Un peu bruyant quand même une fois plein.

A refaire pour tester le salé cette fois !"}
{"text":"I was looking for a brunch place on yelp and of course, L'Avenue was the first place that popped up. After reading a couple reviews, I decided to try it despite all the comments about the long wait time and I'm so glad I did!

Yes, the wait was long. I think I waited about 45-50 minutes. The menu has a variety of choices of sweet and savoury foods, or even both for the indecisive (like myself)! You get the best of both worlds :). I got scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, and Nutella French Toast. Everything was delicious; so full of flavour - including the watermelon infused water! The portions were huge and you can definitely share with a friend. Even the drinks were oversized!

The servers were friendly and the prices are very reasonable. 

I can't wait to go back to Montreal so I can have brunch here again! I would highly recommend this place. And check out the bathroom!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but I don't think the wait is worth it since it's just average breakfast food choices that you can get anywhere without the crazy overhyped wait. After waiting in line for the typical food choices half of my day was gone. Also two items I really wanted weren't being offered (the Mac and cheese and also French fries). Who doesn't serve French fries? Still really good though. The potatoes were delish and the decor is awesome. I just wouldn't wait in the long line again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for brunch.      
I tried both locations more than once, the one located on Mont-Royal and the one on Notre-Dame.  My favorite is Notre-Dame. The place is new, big and bright. The decor is close enough in both locations.

I go there during weekends. Always expect to find a line from 10am to 2:00pm.  
For small groups (table of 4 or less), the waiting time could go as long as 20min and for big groups (more than 5) the waiting could go beyond an hour. I had to wait once for 1hour & 10min and I can tell that it was worth it.

Right at the entrance, you can take sneak peak at the kitchen and check the chef preparing the platters. You will also notice the big Nutella jars ! 

Once you're in, facing the bar you will notice that big transparent water container filled with watermelon. They serve water from this container and it tastes good. The watermelon remove the back taste of the chlorine you get from drinking tap water.

When it comes to ordering, all their platters are good. You won't be disappointed. Nevertheless, if you do not know what to choose, go for the L'Indecie. I posted a pic of that dish. 

The bathrooms are designed in a funky way.

Despite the waiting time, the service is excellent and feel free to ask questions to the waiters as they are professional and will be very happy to answer all your questions."}
{"text":"After an hour in the rain I was skeptical that the wait would be worth it.  After the first half hour we decided that we were committed.  So happy that we roughed it out.  The complimentary fruit skewer was just ok, but it was free, so that was a plus.  Then we ordered Nutella coffee, which was very good.  I ordered Eggs Benedict and my wife ordered French toast with apple cheddar cheese and bacon.   The best Eggs Benedict I have ever had.  The beer soaked ham and unique beef sauce compliments the eggs, muffin and hollandaise sauce perfectly. Just the right amount of savory and sweet.  The French toast was amazing, pure sugary bliss and all of the flavors blended just right.  The line is a pain, but the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is delicious and the restaurant also has a great vibe! There is almost always a line out the front door and the tables are tightly packed inside but I walk out satisfied no matter which menu item I choose!"}
{"text":"Cool place, friendly service. My friend and I went here on a weekday morning around 8:45am and we were seated right away. 

We both ordered their Steak and eggs Benedict. It was recommended to us by the waiter. He said it is their signature dish. Although it was tasty, it was way too rich and filling. We could have easily split one dish. 

I also ordered a Raspberry, Strawberry and Liche juice. It was huge and way too filling. I only drank a quarter of it because if I drank anymore i would have been stuffed. We also ordered Hot Chocolates. They were good.

I would definitely come here again next time I am in Montreal, but will order something completely different. They had a lot of great sounding items on their menu. If I had any more time left in Montreal I would have made my way one more time to L'Avenue, unfortunately we leave tomorrow. 

Their bathrooms are really cool. They also give you watermelon infused water, which is a nice touch. I also thought the prices were pretty reasonable being how filling and hearty everything was.

Give them a try."}
{"text":"This is probably the longest wait I've ever had for a meal, but I would do it again in a heartbeat. My 4 friends and I waited in line for 2 hours on a Saturday for brunch, so our expectations were extremely high. Let me tell you that it's really as good as everyone says. The inside of the restaurant has a really cool and hip vibe to it. As weird as it is to talk about on Yelp, their bathroom is an experience of its own.

I started off with their smoothie with the mango and lychee. Wow, this itself was a game changer. It was so good and fresh, but it was not too sweet. The cup itself is huge, so it would be a good size to share with someone. For my entree, I ordered their combo plate that comes with eggs, pancakes, and 2 sides. For my sides I had the potatoes and ham. I'm not even a big fan of ham, but this was incredible. The potatoes were definitely the best potatoes I've ever had. For the pancakes, I had the chocolate pretzel pancakes. They were perfectly fluffy and topped with crunchy bits of pretzels and drizzled with chocolate. It surprisingly wasn't sickeningly sick or rich due to the crunchy/salty pretzels. Everything was so flavorful and cooked to perfection.

My friends and I all agreed that this was one of the best brunches we've ever had, if not the best brunch ever. The service was also great. They are pretty quick with the food and attentive to your requests. This is a must-do in Montreal!"}

open cuisine ...service was fast and very professional....
i would totally go back there"}
{"text":"Best brunch place I've ever been to in my life. Their signature french toast is unbelievable."}

{"text":"This place definitely lives up to the yelp expectations. There was about 20 minutes wait but it was all worth it. I recommend to start off with a fresh juice smoothie and then get the chorizo Benny. Also the french toast with bananas, nutella and coconut cream is to die for. If you are visiting Montreal I will say that this is a most"}
{"text":"Get the Classic eggs Benedict and thank me later.  They call the meat beer braised ham but it's more like American pulled pork (though definitely has a beer flavor to it).  I still think about it sometimes..."}
{"text":"Il y a toujours la file dehors beau temps mauvais temps. Pour les dejeuners exceptionels? Les jolies serveuses? L'ambiance? Les salles de bain futuristes?"}
{"text":"Awesome service, wonderfull food and nice portions for the price! Well worth the waiting in line."}
{"text":"Best Brunch I've ever had...even though the menus are only in French, do not worry, because the incredibly friendly wait staff will help you find exactly what you're looking for.  

First, they bring you a nice little tasting of Fresh Fruit as an appetizer.  Very Fresh, Very yummy.  Then come the main courses...I had the Banana/Captain Morgan/Nutella French Toast - it was absolutely amazing.  The best French Toast I've ever had and they get everything just right - not too much or too little of anything.  My boyfriend got the salmon Eggs Benedict and he said the same...really, really, really good.  As were the breakfast potatoes that came with it.  

I will go back."}
{"text":"Wow ~ great portion of delicious food and great service! The bathroom is the best surprise yet! 

Duck confit egg benny! Yummm! Loaded w caramelized onion ~ yum yum ~ mustard on top balance it perfectly! My friend ordered her fav smoke salmon one! Looks delicious! We also got greedy ordered caramelized banana Nutella coconut chip French toast ~ Devine level satisfied! 

Nutella mocha, what do you except? So goood! Coconut milk maple syrup coffee was on point too! 

I love everything about this place except I hate to waste food. Almost wish the sweet plate can do single serving or smaller portion."}
{"text":"This is basically the place to be for breakfast/ brunch. A friend and I were hungry and in the area. We had heard wonderful things about the menu and were dying to try out the benedict selection.  We came by around noon on a Saturday...BIG MISTAKE. The line was about a 1.5 hour wait time. We were already hungry so we decided against it and chose another place. On Sunday, we woke up early and came around 9:30am and there was still a line. This time we waited about 45min before we were seated. Once inside we realized why there was such a long line/wait time. The place is tiny! We were seated in very close proximity to the tables around us. So close in fact that we could share menus and actively discuss our daily plans. If you're not as social as me and my companinon, this might be a huge deal breaker. I ordered a chorizo eggs benedict and I must say it was lackluster. There was plenty of food but not a lot of flavor. The chorizo was the main contributor, which was kind of the downfall as sausages in general are rather salty. My friend however loved her dish. She ended up ordering the famous French Toast Benedict and was thrilled with the sweet and savory combination. Overall, if you're okay with lines, cramped seating and you order the French Toast Benny, you'll have a five star experience! I'm happy I tried it, but there is an abundance of breakfast spots in Montreal to try so I don't think this one will make the list next time I visit."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is phenomenal! Came here for brunch and left wanting to make this our brunch spot for the remainder of our trip (and to plan a visit to come back for more). 

The staff was really friendly and helpful/ The food was delicious - I went with the breakfast poutine which was more than filling enough. They also have exotic fruit drinks (think smoothie), milkshakes, and a range of brunch and burgers. We spent 30 minutes flipping through the menu and wanting to order everything on it since each meal sounded very good. They have sweet, savory, and healthy options depending on your preference. As an added bonus, each meal comes with a skewer of fruit and the watermelon was soaked in the water that they serve.

Additionally - this place is really eclectic. The menu cracked us up as they split up meals based on personalities. The bathroom was trippy (black lights, graffiti, a strange clock), that is worth visiting even if you don't need to use it. Overall, a great experience and a place we will return to."}
{"text":"Food here is legit, and the portions are HUGE. They give you bread and a fruit skewer with all of the brunch meals, so you end up having a full meal plus a fruit appetizer. 4 year aged cheddar with caramelized onion benedict is awesome -- flavors are perfectly on point! Mushroom omelette was pretty good too.

The wait wasn't bad at all, and the service is friendly. They aren't super prompt, but this place is busy, and they do a good job considering the volume.

Cool, hip cafe playing upbeat music that reminds me of the Castro in San Francisco (gay district). Retro lighting and wall graffiti art. Awesome bathroom art!! So freaking cool."}
{"text":"Today was my second brunch at L'Avenue in two weeks--no explanation necessary once you've been!

My first time I chowed down on their \"Bobby does Dallas\"--a to-die-for skillet. Today I indulged in the \"Dejeuner Cabane a Sucre\"--a sweet and savoury combo of eggs, hashbrowns, beans, fluffy pancakes, and possibly the most amazing ham I've ever had. 

Great service, and the bathroom is a can't-miss!"}
{"text":"Dat egg Benny. I had the sweet one with ham. Wife had wild mushroom. It's the real deal Nutella coffee is very sweet. You get fruit skewer before your food. Nice washroom."}
{"text":"In a city like Montreal, you have to have great food to survive.  Unfortunately, this place focuses all energy on appearance and being trendy, with the food taking second stage.  Unless you're the type of person who just wants to be seen, it's not worth the long line."}
{"text":"Une très belle découverte faire ce matin dans le quartier St-Henri. De magnifique assiettes, excellent service, frais, superbe décoration, pas eu aussi bonne experience depuis longtemps."}
{"text":"Greaaat food! Perfect ending to our Montreal trip. This location does not have big queues unlike the other location. We had the Goat omelette and strawberry pancakes.. both were delicious! Will definitely visit again during my next trip to Montreal!"}
