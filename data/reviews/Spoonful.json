{"text":"Very popular at the moment, we went there last wknd, and wait for almost 1.5hours to get in. There were others came with reservation but had to wait as well. 
But once you get in, everything went smoothly, food was fresh, service was good. 
 The only downside is the price, it is a bit pricy. But they do have discount for birthday month and also on the actual birthday. Overall you should give a try, especially if you love sashimi and fresh seafood."}
{"text":"I have been to spoonful many times I love the staff and the food is  great! They offer more than other all you can eat restaurants. I must say one of the best buffets I've been to by far and the only buffet I know that serve raw oysters and scallop. 
They have many variety for desserts.

The wait can be long if your are going on the weekend I do recomend making reservations although sometimes you don't get in right away, but it's better to make the reservations or you probably will be waiting for a few hours"}
{"text":"The food is bland, bland, bland. Nothing was good, just ok. There is a large selection of seafood, which is why I decided to try it but I was disappointed."}
{"text":"The decor was nice but that was it. The food was cold or stale and is prepared in a halfassed way and presented sloppily. The beef skewers sat in a pan filled with liquid making them appear more like boiled meat than barbecued. Some apps looked like they straight from a Costco or M&M freezer. Even the mini \"Tiny Tom\" donuts were prepared in advance and we're cold and hard, not as they should be. 

Spoonful hails from Imperial Buffet which is all the reason you need to avoid it. But we chanced it anyway and were predictably disappointed."}
{"text":"Sadly I managed to only try about 1/4 of the items and I was so full.  I will for sure go back again.  Most of the food I tried was pretty good.  The oysters was not that good though, but luckily as expected.    For $27.99 all you can eat buffet with oysters??? shouldn't expect that much.   After this visit to spoonful, I was wondering how can Mandarin even survive, like I mean food selection here comparing to Mandarin......there's just no comparison.   Both of the restaurant charge the same price and the selection at spoonful is way way way better.  I don't think I will ever go back to Mandarin again."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. People told me this place was better than Mandarin. I don't think so. Customer service is slow food is nothing great. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have not dined at buffet restaurants in a long time, but we decided to try Spoonful last Wednesday after a couple friends recommended it to us. 

The restaurant itself is nice, modern, and spacious with a few separate dining areas. The variety of food is decent and their desserts are endless. 

Our favourites were the lobster bisque (not too creamy or salty), cold crab legs (a bit salty but still good), and grilled pork belly (need I say any more?)...and the chocolate fountain. The fresh donuts were good, too.

But...the rest of the hot foods were just all right. There's a big wheel of various ice cream flavours, but the pastries weren't anything special.

We've heard pretty good things about the seafood bar in particular, which was impressive, and it was the reason we chose Spoonful over Wok of Fame. On a Wednesday night, only shrimps, crab legs, mussels, octopus, and whelks were available. Unfortunately, the mussels were mushy and tasteless, the octopus was rubbery and also tasteless, and the whelks had a VERY unpleasant smell to them! I noticed the smell the moment I picked one up. I was very surprised that they were still being served despite the awful fishy smell. The next time I walked by the seafood bar, they were all gone. (Someone must have complained about them before I got the chance to.)

Even worse, I woke up the next morning at 5 due to a stomachache and nausea. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the mussels or the octopus because neither had any taste, which made me think they were not very fresh."}
{"text":"WELL - when we arrived,  we kinda felt unwanted.. It was an hour and a half before close & they were skeptical about seating us. (Not because there wouldn't be fresh food; food was still coming out during our entire visit) One of our waters was served in a broken glass, creating a huge puddle of water on our table/seats. Food wasn't bad. Waiter kept taking away our drink menu when I specifically asked to keep it each time. Very family oriented and a big busy mess on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I have been many buffets. I claims spoonful above average buffet.  I highly recommend it.  It has variety of food"}
{"text":"The environment was nice however the food was a bit tasteless and the soft serve ice cream well dont get your hopes up, it was grainy and runny as if the icecream maker has diereah will not recommend this place as it is overpriced for a saturday buffet and the food isnt all that."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for a while, finally decided to check it out. Came here for lunch on a Tuesday. We had an hour and 15minutes left before they were going to close. Ample time right? The food selections were wide and they all tasted good.  However, the SERVICE SUCKS! The one attending to us was rushed, inattentive and did not have a drop of service extended to us. My husband ordered coffee, it smelled good but no sugar nor any spoon offered to him. When asked for sugar, it was short to being shoved on the table and when asked for a stirrer was bluntly told to get it from the dessert area. We couldn't help but shake our heads. Unfortunately, service is just as important as good food for us. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"To be honest, my bf and I question why this restaurant doesn't get a higher rating. I am not the most fond of buffets, because I can't eat THAT much food...but I've tried many buffets before. The best I've had were in Hong Kong and Las Vegas' Bacchanal was right there behind it. In Toronto, I've been to Mandarin, China Buffet King, Dragon Pearl, Dragon Legend, and now this.

For a buffet in Toronto/Brampton, I'm going to say this buffet deserves a 5 star rating. Even though not every single item is to my liking in taste, most things taste great. Not only is there an extensive raw bar: oysters, scallops (AMAZING), sea snails, shrimp, mussels, octopus, and crab legs, they even have baked mussels, baked scallops (I LOVE scallops), all the sushi/sashimi/maki/hand rolls you'd want, varieties of pasta (made to order), charcuterie (meats galore), salad bar, and so on. There is a lot of variety and everything is fresh. I'm not sure what others are looking for but everything we wanted to eat was available and you get your money's worth here. 

For the dessert lovers, there is SO MUCH to offer: cream pies, ice cream sandwiches, soft serve ice cream that even has STRAWBERRY, cheesecakes, regular cakes, cookies, fruits, chocolate fountain, fresh donuts, and even a candy bar.

It's a very good buffet and the decor and seating is very comfortable. So, I'd suggest you try it and if you are seated before 530 on weekends, you get a 10% off your bill (if you pay by cash of course).

Also, there was no time limit when we went on a Saturday night so that was awesome. Even with the 2 oysters/2 scallops restriction per plating it didn't bother us."}
{"text":"I believe it's the best buffet in GTA,very good place for families, friends together.....

It's my only choice of Asian buffet from now on..."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The lines for the buffet stations are so long that by the time you get back to your seat, the food is cold. The restaurant is designed poorly. The buffet stations are not organized well. We waited over 1 hour for a table because we thought it would be amazing, but we were wrong. Such a disappointment. There is little variety especially in the vegetable department.
There is a lot of seafood, but before you get too excited, it's mostly cold seafood (on ice, unseasoned). The odd warm item is made into something else (like a soup or tart). The oyster / scallop lady strictly rations them - 2 per plate. The most bizarre thing I saw all night was a photographer taking food photos in this booth right in the middle of the buffet.
Chaos ... Just chaos!!"}
{"text":"I called and made reservations for two for 5:30pm. The girl who answered the phone was fluent in English and informative for questions that I asked such as raw oysters only available on Friday and Saturdays. The restaurant has more of a modern atmosphere with lights slightly dimmed as opposed to the full lighting of usual buffets. There are two sections for seating and it was only about 50% full. The buffet area takes up a lot of space but doesn't have as much offerings as it appears to.
   
Started off with the seafood section which had clams, mussels, octopus, snails, shrimp, oysters and crab legs. The clams and mussels were pretty good. The crab legs were standard fare but the reason I wanted to try Spoonful out was for the oysters. Before I got there I was thinking I would eat plates of them but nope. DISAPPOINTING. The oysters didn't have an off taste, but they actually didn't have any taste of all. I was waiting for the sweet and salty taste of fresh oysters to hit me but I really couldn't taste anything. Had a few of them and left it at that. I asked for wet naps after finishing the crab legs and was told they only have napkins. Was expecting them to have wet naps if one of their main focuses is on crab legs and people usually use their hands to eat them.

The salad bar had some slightly different offerings such as shrimp ceviche, steak with a salad dressing, and tomato and buffalo mozzarella skewers. The other side had soba noodles, smoked salmon, and prosciutto. There was also a soup section with four different soups but I didn't bother with those.

The hot food stations had more western food as opposed to Chinese food. There were items such as baked mussels, escargot, crab legs, clams in a cream sauce, and ribs. The carvery had ham, lamb shoulder, prime rib, and brisket. Spoonful's facebook had an image with emphasis to their \"Robatayaki Grill\". The only thing that came off of it was chicken and lamb skewers. Seems to be a waste of the grill as I was looking forward to a variety of skewers. The sushi station had the typical variety of sashimi. The rolls they offered were a surprise as they were nicely presented and looked like the ones found at ayce Japanese restaurants as opposed to Metro sushi.

They had two double sided dessert sections with various offerings of cakes and fruit. I really enjoyed the chocolate fountain that I stuck giant strawberries into. The donuts from the donut machine tasted like Tiny Toms from the carnival! The ice cream from the soft ice cream machine was melting and I didn't try the waffle machine. They had this hard ice cream machine that was pretty cool but for display only. The ice cream was in a separate mini fridge. They had a few of these mini fridges/display around. There were two at the dessert stations with egg tarts, mango pudding, creme brulee, etc. 

The total damage was $68.06 and they gave us a $10.00 gift certificate for our next return. Overall it was an alright meal. It's average to spend around $30.00 for a dinner on a weekend so I was okay about it. I don't think I will be rushing to come back here and may not even use the GC. The food was okay - not bad and not great. The presentation was a plus and the washrooms are really nice and clean! My main point of coming here was for the oysters and since they weren't that great I don't think it's worth the trek back up to Brampton again."}
{"text":"Some people said food is tasteless, but I diasgree. It is not overly seasoned, and there is so much variety so you are wanting to try more even though you are full.
Price is more than fair, and I love how they give 20 percent off for people aged 55 and up.
Everything was fresh and there was so, so much variety, from the salad to seafood to the Asian selection and western selection. Desserts are all very good and plentiful, with two separate sections of it on each side of the buffet floor. Sashimi was very fresh, and they have items that no other buffet has.
The owner said in the video posted on Yelp that Spoonful is a Las Vegas style buffet, and I agree. I was in Las Vegas just a month ago (went to Wicked Spoon at Wynn. Possibly he got his inspiration for Spoonful from here...)
The interior and design of the place definitely reminds me of Las Vegas buffets. Very trendy and upscale.

My only complaints are not about the food. There is just so much selection and I was so surprised that they all tasted pretty good. For food and interior, I give 5 stars. Just a warning though, when you are eating their lamb, be very careful for bones.  

I have two points for feedback:

1) Service does not match the upscale image. The servers definitely need more training. Some servers were very good, while some came off very rude because they were so curt, although I understand they were not trying to be. I understand that you cannot be smiling all the time, but at least be professional. Also, we had one server standing on one side of the table ask my father to pass his empty plate to her, which was put aside at the other side of the table. He had to stop eating and pass the plate to her across the table.

2) Cutlery and plates were not properly washed. I did not see any huge chunks of food on them, but I saw leftover food debris on the supposed-to-be clean spoons or plates, who definitely lowered my appetite whenever I saw it.

Other than the two above points, an excellent place. Kudos to the owner for the great food and ambiance at a really, really great price. The place can get a little loud because it can be packed and there are a lot of birthday parties thrown here, but that is understandable and I did not feel cramped."}
{"text":"For a buffet, this place has great food. The decor and food quality is a step up from Mandarin, and there's much more variety. Definitely recommended if you love binging on seafood, and their dessert selection is great too. They also have crab legs every night but they're cold and on ice, which is a little disappointing but doesn't stop me from eating two plates full."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Friday night as my friend really wanted to try this place out. 

I'm a big fan of buffets not only because I like food but I love a wide variety of food. 

This place is huge! I was expecting big but it surprised me.

The night didn't get off to a good start from the get go. The hostess was not smiling or friendly at all. But who comes to a buffet for the hostess anyways. 

Upon sitting down I noticed a shrimp shell from the previous table right next to my utensils...not a good sign. I was also missing a fork. After asking our server I ended up getting it myself.

The buffet itself had one of the biggest selections of foods I've seen. And the food was not terrible but I would say Mandarin has better quality.

I also did not appreciate that they \"try\" to limit you but asking that you only take so many of one item per trip. If my plate can hold 4 oysters I'll take 4 oysters!

Our server was not very good either. She never smiled and we had to ask a couple times for our drink refills. She also spoke to us several times in Mandarin even though each time we responded in English and had a lost and puzzled look on our face.

Nice looking ice cream display but I hate that it's not self serve. And they only give you 1 scoop! And when you ask for more they give you a dirty look! Who only gets 1 scoop on their waffles!! Tell me who??!?!

While we were still eating our dessert the waitress came and asked if we wanted one bill or separate....bitch can you let us enjoy the first round of our dessert! 

For the cheaper I get great service and better quality food at Mandarin....which means I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Those pineapple things by the noodles were to die for! Definitely my favourite. One thing I noticed was that the food wasn't stocked all the way. I wanted tortellini pasta but it was empty and there was no one around to ask for more. Waitress didn't refill our waters right away, but it was a pretty busy night. For the price, the food was excellent. There was a great selection of things to choose from and the sushi and sashimi was super fresh! Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Starting with the ambience of the restaurant.  It has a similar aura as the Shangrila hotel -- which makes it feel high end. It looks very fancy with its modern and upscale decor. The food is fantastic.  I really liked the lobster bisque,the lasagna,the cheese covered mussels and the huge selection of deserts.They have crepes, waffles,donuts, cream pies and cheese cakes. The staff is accommodating and friendly considering I dropped my food twice. Hey what can I say I was running to get my food. It's that delicious! In fact I finished my donuts before I even got back to my table. Overall this is my favourite buffet and would love to come here again"}
{"text":"For the price of a weekend buffet ticket, not worth it!  Went for a Sunday night looking forward to seafood and ribs.. Oysters had long line ups with 3max each time and was frozen!  The ribs and other grilled meats were plain tasting. Service was ok but value was not there!"}
{"text":"Omg! So good so many selections so relaxing nice atmosphere lots of varieties! Will definitely come here again! 10× better than Mandarin! I should have took some pictures but I was too busy stuffing my face I forgot."}
{"text":"Lots of food choices and a lot of the food was very tasy. Their beef teriyaki aaa beef had really good flavour and was so tender. Their seafood selection was also very good. Their raw oysters, scallops and sashimi were very fresh in particular. Quite enjoyed this meal. Their icecream selection was huge too. They also had 4 soft serve icecream machines on top of that. It is pricier than other buffets but you get a lot better quality and selection of food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had a pleasant lunch here. The decor is amazing, food selection is very good. You will find something to eat for sure. Lots of grilled meats, pasta and Chinese dishes. The dessert selection is bigger! Lots and lots to choose from. The chocolate fountain was nice with all the fresh fruit. Toddlers under 5 are $2, adults were $18 for the weekend lunch."}
{"text":"Yet another buffet review for me!!!

So a few highlights of my review:

1. Decor and atmosphere are very modern and attractive
2. Wide variety of food and dessert
3. Service was good
4. Quality of food and dessert was good
5. Best buffet I've been to so far

SOOO!!! I walked into this buffet with low expectations, as the last buffet I went to was the Dragon Pearl Buffet. However, as I walked in I could tell that this was going to be a MUCH better experience than Dragon Pearl. The place was very clean and had a cool look to it. (Looks are very important when it comes to food!!!!... and people :P ) So i got a bunch of stuff... mainly meat... which was pretty good... got a slice of lamb and roast beef... some salmon... veggie rice... other people got lots of oysters, muscles, crab legs, some sort of lobster tarts, oyster tarts and escargot tarts that were all good according to them as, sadly, I am allergic to shell fish... 

BUT the highlight of the night was the dessert!!! they had a rotating ice cream station... the ice cream was decently frozen... I HATE mushy ice cream!!! so i was happy.. they had imitation tiny tom donuts (which when fresh are BOMB SHIT!!!!) they had a bunch of different cakes... sugar free stuff... and puddings... I got the mango pudding which was good!!! and they also had chocolate fondue which was wicked with strawberries...  there were also marshmellows as well but yeah sooo much to choose from... I got a crepe with ice cream... as well as a waffle with ice cream... the fresh waffle was good... the only thing that wasn't great was the soft serve... when it says soft.. they mean SOFT!!! by the time I got to my table my ice cream had melted...

BUT all in all a very good chinese buffet!!!!

So CONGRATS SPOONFUL!!! YOU ARE TOOTUFF APPROVED!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place.

If i could give half stars i would, it would get 3.5/5

This place has a wide variety of food, from japanese, pastas, corn dogs, to the regular western asian buffets. 

It's not amazing, but its like mandarin quality food. I never leave this place unsatisfied so give it a go! I know they have discounts on certain days, check their Facebook."}
{"text":"The food was disappointing. Went there on a weekend and there was no prime rib, and no sweet shrimp. The food was on the slightly bland side. The main perk is the 50% off for those who dine there on their birthday and 10% off for the rest of the party."}
{"text":"I think that the food selection here is great, however there is an incredible amount of noise in the dining room.

While all our guests were happy with their food and there were more than enough selections to choose from, the loud noise made it difficult to carry a conversation like my family normally does around the table."}
{"text":"Excellent Huge Buffet, Will be going back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Super hungry on Sunday night.  We went to Spoonful and were seated right away around 6 pm with plenty of open seats around us.   

Seafood bar is the most popular with crab legs, oysters, shrimp, mussels and whelks.  In the end the crab legs were tastiest.   Although all fresh, the oysters were a bit fishy tasting.  

Everything else is what you'd expect at a buffet.  Yes the doughnut machine was there but we didn't see it in operation.  The doughnuts were cold and kinda stale.  

I think if you like dessert you'd be in heaven because I think the ratio of dessert bars to food bars is 2:1.  The cakes are the same as every single Chinese buffet place in the GTA.   

For me it was alright...the food was just okay.  Somehow I expected more....I saw one table of 8 just KILLING the seafood bar.  I seriously thought they were going to get kicked out.  So I guess if that's your thing it's probably worth a visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten 7 times since finding this restaurant by chance last summer.
This is by FAR the best quality food and selection for a buffet.
Friday and Saturday are best for seafood feasts and the Peking duck sizzles on the grill beside suckling pig with excellent crackling!
As with all buffets not everything is worth more than a try but overall the quality and taste of Spoonful's dishes are better than any other restaurants in the genre."}
{"text":"Nice assortment of food and really great selection of dessert. I enjoyed the fact that there is a sushi bar too. Service is usually good and i enjoy the atmosphere. I would come again."}
{"text":"My review and rating is based only on their lunch buffet.

Probably one of the best deals for a lunch buffet in terms of selection and price. We went on a weekday and it was $14.99/person. There were probably 30 people in the whole restaurant. They had a wide selection of seafood, including octopus, shrimp and mussels. I bet they have the crab and sashimi at night. The hot food was standard for an Asian buffet, but they had a nice Lobster bisque in the soup section. Decent salad bar with a variety of items you don't usually see (beef with dressing, alfalfa sprouts). Big selection of deserts, ice cream, soft serve, and candy."}
{"text":"The best buffet ever I thought when I first went there my New York cousins echoed the same words when they took them there.I have been there multiple times and found great food stations spread beautifully across the dining rooms. A must for all food lovers to try ."}
{"text":"This place is the best buffet I've ever been here! First of all, this is a huge place, it's so pretty, big and comfy inside, a little bit noisy due to the great amount of people that go there. They have so many different variety of food and all of them are delicious! Especially their seafood like oysters, scallops and crabs, I will go for like 5 rounds. They also have dishes like Italian, Japanese and all kinds! Lastly, their desserts! OMG! They have so many desserts even a donuts machine and all so good! Really recommend you to go although it's pretty far."}
{"text":"Very nice selection of the different variety of foods, staff is friendly and quick to clean up. My son and I really enjoyed it and will be going back sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"This is the buffet for seafood loves, you got the unlimited supply of oysters, scallops, shrimps, octopus and mussels.  They seemed to be of good quality, didn't notice any unusual smell with the seafoods.  Their sushi section was great, lots of specialty rolls and sashimi was pretty good as well.  Their kitchen food on the other side seems average, but I think they have lot of selections compared to other buffets.

In terms of desert, they have the cool turning ice cream machine and a nice chocolate fountain.  Lots of selections as well when it comes to dessert.

I would give this place a 3.5 but I'm only giving them a 2 star.  My friend and I were grabbing some I believed it was baked scallops or something like that, as he was taking them onto his plate, someone grabbed his hand behind the counter and rudely told us that you can only take two as the sign says. We were looking for the sign and discovered yes there was a sign but it was not faced in the line up direction.  It was kind of embarrassing, I was extremely pissed that I had to give him a look then I saw the two kitchen workers laughing at each other as if it was funny or something."}
{"text":"Went for my brothers birthday. Great selection of food and quicke service. Would come again"}
{"text":"More like a 4.5, but good enough to round up to 5. I was recommended this buffet by a friend and was not disappointed. The place is trendy and upcale, and one of the nicest place in the buffet is the washroom, no joke. 12 foot high stalls, waterfall faucets, basin sinks, automated soap dispensers, dyson blades, WOW! 

I guess I should talk about the food. This place boasts seafood on their website and they don't lie. Over half of their food items are seafood, from fresh crab legs, mussels, shrimp, octopus, conch, to a wide variety of baked/grilled and prepared seafood.

How about Smooth and creamy Lobster Bisque soup? Lobster tart? Escargot Deluxe?? If that doesn't get you going, don't know what will. They still have freshly prepared \"real\" meat for all you barbeque lovers, maple maple ribs, chicken robataka chicken skewer, beef skewer, grilled cucumber/zucchini and more.  In case you are into the typical buffet food like fried rings, fries, fried wings, yes they still have all that, plus additional goodies like fried calamari. And of course, they have the usual chinese food dishes as well.

Desert selection includes a wide variety of cakes, baked goods, ice cream, fruits, and as you probably know, they have a fondue fountain. Not much of a dessert guy, but some of the stuff was a hit and some was a miss. The berry brulee was garbage, but there was some other egg pudding thing that actually tasted like creme brulee and that was pretty good. Something rare is they also have some interesting candies. 

Service was okay, I don't expect much from buffets and they did their job. Overall, this place loses 0.5 points for:
-a couple (literally only one or two plates) that resembled very close to what I had bought at costco not too long ago.
-fruit could be more ripe
-toddler under 5 costs $2. Seems almost cruel? 

FYI:
MON-THURS: 40% off for seniors 55+
WED: 30% off for guys
THURS: 30% off for ladies

Tip: Go on Mon-Thurs, Fri-Sun is substantially more expensive +$7

I would add pictures to this review, but I was too busy eating."}
{"text":"Very nice Restaurant. Buffet style ,wide selection and good tasty food. Also spacious inside and outside parking."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this buffet at all. The variety is extremely random and it feels like they just went to Costco and baked a bunch of random items! 

I also didn't like that you can't get your own icecream and a server has to scoop it for you."}
{"text":"My biggest advice to you when it comes to Spoonful is if you hate crowds and lineups and you want to come here on a weekend, book for 4:30 as soon as it opens.  Everything is fresh, plentiful, and not too crowded.  We came here on Saturday, for an early Mother's Day Dinner.  The raw scallops were great and available.  Everything else was great.  My only problem was the grilled shrimp skewers were undercooked so watchout for that as well as with the chicken.  As always the dessert selection was massive and can easily tempt you into a diabetic coma."}
{"text":"Spoonful reminds me of a low to mid end hotel buffet in Hong Kong.  Essentially, if you're after high quality, do not pass Go, do not collect $200, and skip all buffets.
If you're looking for a large variety with relatively good quality though, then Spoonful is the place to be! 

Higher quality than that certain ubiquitous, chain-owned buffet, Spoonful seems to be the brainchild of a think tank run by children that answered the question of \"What do you wish you had unlimited access to?\"  The answers are pretty awesome: a gummy candy bar, no less than four soft serve ice cream machines, a multi-tiered chocolate fountain, and a baby doughnut machine. Seriously guys, baby.  Doughnut.  Machine.  For the adults, a seafood bar on ice offering raw scallops and raw oysters on the half shell, cold crab legs (also served in the hot food bar), and the rarely-found sea whelk.  I heard the octopus pieces were pretty tasty too.  

Great ideas, pretty good in execution, but ultimately it's still buffet food.  The roast beef was really tough, and no amount of gravy (offered in a dark, thick option or in the liquidy, \"light\"/jus form) could hide it.  Crab legs are smaller than from the ubiquitous Mandarin and their shells are somehow on the softer side.  On the plus side though, they offer melted butter in a heated soup pot, which some buffet places strangely skimp on.  Fruits seemed fresh. I liked that they keep some miniature desserts in cafe-style counter-top glass cases, making cream puffs and egg tarts feel much fancier.  The salad bar is a bit sad, nobody really gets anything from it, as evidenced by the dried-out proscuitto slices. Stir-fried clams with black bean sauce! Another rare buffet item. Not enough \"wok-hei\" to make it delish, but meh, AYCE right?  

Crowd was pretty good when I visited, as people actually lined up and didn't hoard food - way less stressful than going to an Asian grocery store!"}
{"text":"WOW! Stupendous! Love this place! This place is literally seafood, sushi, and buffet HEAVEN. Probably one of the best buffets I've been to in the GTA! 100x better than your typical Mandarin Restaurant. So much selection, it is almost overwhelming! Overall good service and able to accommodate huge groups/ families.

They have a fresh and wide variety of seafood options: lobster, shrimp, oyster, clam, octopus, mussel, eel, salmon, tuna, and more. Everything tasted so fresh and was high quality.

I also had a variety of their sushis, sashimi, and fries. Moreover, if that's not enough, they have a wide selection of meat and cuts including: steak, roasted chicken, pork, etc.

Lastly, their dessert options were just as great. Tons of flavours of cakes, puddings, pies, jellos, and ice cream to select from.

Paid for dinner price, worth every penny!! Certainly coming back here! Prepare to feast!"}
{"text":"Its a buffet so you can't expect culinary extraordinaire but as a buffet place it definitely stands out. 

Spoonful by Imperial Buffet was an upscale gourmet Buffet Experience!!! They have a seafood inspired gourmet cooking experience going on and lots to choose from in terms of sea food.

The fill menu includes but is not limited to...Well you can also enjoy Brazilian churrasco grill, international cuisine flavors (Italian, Asian Fusion, Japanese, Thai, North American), sushi/sashimi ice platform, extravagant seafood tower including oysters, scallops and crab legs.

The place is nicely decorated and quiet huge, so space wont be a problem. I took around 28 people and the server was able to manage us and keep our table clean at all times. 

Overall, as a buffet place it does a good job!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and like the restaurant. In my experience it is best to come early in the week as it can get busy on weekends. At first glance, there does not seem to be as much variety as other buffets; however, that is deceiving. Look around and you will find interesting items at several stations. My favourite food is their lobster bisque. There is a huge (probably too huge) desert selection that unless you are careful, you will pack on a few pounds as a result of trying it..

The restaurant features a nice clean modern design that visually is much more satisfying than the design of a large buffet just down the street.."}
{"text":"(Weekend price) great buffet if you like seafood and dessert!! TIP: come early if you want raw oyster and raw scallop, they go fast. They have crab legs (cold/ hot/ salt & pepper), oysters (raw and baked), mussels (hot/ cold), clams (cold), whelk snail (cold), octopus (cold), shrimp (cold/ hot), escargot (baked). They have also the typical asian stir fry, western ravioli, fries, etc. Sushi selection is decent and they do have a real sashimi bar (unlike imperial and mandarin). They have lamb shoulder, prime rib, chicken beef ribs etc on grill. The other best part is dessert!! Good variety of dessert taking up 1/3 of the restaurant space. They have pastries, waffles, hard ice cream, soft serve ice cream, one gelato (lemon), bulk candies and more! Service isnt amazing though; typical buffet style serving and attitudr. Overall great place to come have some nice buffet selection. Lunch Adult Prices: mon-fri $15, sat-sun $19. Dinner Adult Prices: mon-thurs $22, fri-sun $28.

{"text":"They used to be better. 

I'm not sure where to start. My family and I (5 in total) came by for dinner because we were in the area and wanted to give them another shot (my mom got sick from their food last time we went) and because I was really craving for snow crabs.

We arrived at 6pm and was seated promptly. They got our drink order and we headed over to the buffet. I started with the snow crab, raw oysters and raw scallop. The snow crab was mushy - as in the shell was mush, the meat wasn't fresh. Luckily I have a habit of only getting a few pieces at a time so I finished that and worked on the raw scallop and raw oysters. The scallop was pretty decent but the oysters were so nasty. They're the really big ones that Chinese restaurants usually steam so the bigger the oyster, the fishier it is. It was also shucked very poorly - there were shells every where.

My next plate was from the Japanese selection - the sashimi was still frozen when they out it out. I took a few pieces and let it defrost while I ate some of their rolls. The rolls aren't bad but a few looked questionable (raw beef roll) but I still ate it. When I finally got around eating the salmon sashimi, the texture was definitely not right (yes, that happens when you freeze things). It was really mushy and slimy - I really couldn't bring myself to finish it.

I had a few more random items from their buffet then gave up trying to find something good. Honestly, I think the best was the pogo stick. I like that this buffet has a huge selection of food but it really sucks that they can't get anything right. I don't think I am too picky when it comes to eating at a buffet because it's expected that the quality isn't going to be 3-4 star but at least have the food edible? 

We ended up spending $215 (with tax and tips) for the 5 adults and the best part is 4 of us got sick after dinner. Coincidence? I think not.

I will not come back and will not recommend this place. For roughly $40 a person, you're better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for my aunt's birthday. She really really wanted to come here because she had heard so many great things about the buffet. I would say its only one step better than the average buffet and that is only because they have a seafood bar with raw oysters and mussels. There is also alot of fried food and noodles and rice and sushi. There is fruit and salad and also desserts. They also have a waffle stand with ice cream and candy (like bulk barn candy) which is more then an average all-you-can-eat."}
{"text":"I was impressed .. Clean lots of good  food .. Way better the Mandarin great for birthdays"}
{"text":"A few of us went there today for lunch. We got there before noon and it wasn't too busy, so we got seated right away. It was nice for the host to ask us if any of us have a birthday today or this month, because you get a discount if you do.

The place was nice and clean, just a little bit dark in my opinion.

The food was pretty decent compared to other buffets. I enjoyed their sushi, their lobster tart, lobster mac & cheese, fresh pad thai, squid in particular. My friend had the crepe made to order and really enjoyed it! Their dessert selection was really good. I was too full to try a lot. Their fruits were fresh and really good. The grapefruit in particular was delicious and not sour.

We each had green tea but we were charged $2.50 each, a little bit over priced in my opinion, especially that we were sharing a teapot per 2 persons. So $5 for a teapot. 

Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Went here for a family birthday lunch. As far as buffets go, it was good. Decor inside was nice, servers were pleasant and efficient. Some food items were hit and miss-the lobster mac and cheese did not have a morsel of lobster and while it was great that they had a pad Thai station, they did not offer the necessary accoutrements that should go with like bean sprouts, peanuts, cilantro, lime etc this could have elevated the dish. I like the crispy pork belly, the grilled corn and maple BBQ ribs. The donuts were a let down they were saturated right through with the oil that they were cooked in. The line ups were crazy and It was a wait to get food. Would I go back? I would give it another go."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets I have been to. It comes in second after the Bellagio buffet in Vegas. It has a wide variety of food. There is very fresh seafood and sushi. I could not even try everything there was. There was candy stands, a chocolate fondue fountain, donut maker, churros, tons of cake and ice cream. Just so much to pick from. The only downside is the cold crab legs, steamed is way better."}
{"text":"will never eat here again my mom and i have gone here on 3 different occasions and we got sick from the food all three times the food was cold and when you are serving seafood it should be hot"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Saturday.  Tried a variety of the dishes presented. Was impressed with the different seafood selections provided but wasn't impressed with the quality or presentation of the food. Most of the hot seafood dishes I tried were cold as were the vegetable dishes. The oysters that were served by a girl in a cart were not properly shucked, not released from the bottom shell and they were dry with none of the oyster liquor left in the shell.  The sushi selections were ok but there wasn't much of a variety of sashimi. Most of the deserts I tried were of poor quality as well. So for the price, I think I would rather have less selection but better quality. So likely wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday for lunch. It wasn't too busy and lunch was $16.99/person.

Pros:
- Wide selection of foods
- Pretty good service
- Nice ambiance

Cons:
- Pricey for a buffet
- Mexican food is fairly bland"}
{"text":"First time here, and I would never return. The sushi and desserts were alright, but didn't like anything else. It seemed like most of the hot foods had been left out for a while so they've cooled down and gotten hard."}
{"text":"It looks nice inside, like you're visiting the future, and the service was good...

But the food is terrible, nothing had any flavour, I sampled every section and it was the same everywhere, From the sushi, to the Italian, to the BBQ, flavourless everywhere I went. Except the desert section, I tried as much as I could there (with what little stomach space I had left) and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I took my family to this restaurant for my daughter's 13th birthday. Thought we would try something different. We had about 15 people in our party. Once we walked in, it was impressive size wise. As we were seated, our server took our drink orders, but took a little bit of time to get it. We proceeded to get our food and was excited to have Oyster, needless to say they did not have anymore for the evening. I was also put off by the signage that stated \"2 each per person\". It's supposed to be a buffet! The good thing about Spoonful is that they have alot of variety, which I liked and food was decent for a buffet. My favourite was the freshly made mini donuts! I will note that they do have a special where birthday girl/boy eats for half price. Unfortunately, I forgot to bring identifications for my 13 year old daughter so had to pay full price. It was an okay experience, but there are better buffets I have tried out there."}
{"text":"Went here with a family member on our way home from Coburg. Bit of a wait to get in. Service was friendly and quick. There is an amazing selection of foods here. However I was disappointed that a lot of items where luke-warm nothing was distinguishably \"hot\". I anticipated there being a larger selection of vegetables. The squid, mussels, duck, beef and lamb where are cooked perfectly. Nice selection of meats and seafood was fresh. Wish their was some hot crab legs but the cold was Delish. Oyster bar was a nice treat as well. Comfortable seating arrangements and fairly clean washrooms. I would go again!"}
{"text":"So Spoonful happens to own a number of AYCE buffet restaurants under their belt. I've been to this location in Brampton two times before and we enjoyed both visits so when my in-laws came in from out-of-town we thought we would treat them here.

It started off with the four of us waiting at the front counter for 5 minutes. No one was there. I mean no one. It's noon time on a weekday so possibly they might have been busy? So I walked into the hallway and someone finally met me halfway to seat us. I'm still thinking at this point that they must be very busy and that their large seating area is full. When we were seated, I took a quick look around. There were only 10 people in the eating area. Just 10!

The Service: Well the last paragraph sort of sums it all up but I wanted to add that the servers don't clear your plates quick enough. It's not nice to stack your own plates and wave a server over once you finally made eye contact.

The Food: Presentation of food is nicely laid out. Grilled and cooked food in the back, apps on the right, and an entire dessert area on the left. I give them points for their dessert station. There are single stations that hold different types of candies. They also have a carousel that holds several tubs of ice cream that is really cool but just beware that you have to wait until a staff member is available to serve you.

The apps: Lots of choices from salads, fruit, and shrimps packed on ice. Pretty standard like most AYCE buffets where you have to get your own food.

Grill/Cooked food: I have a big issue with this part. Most of the food I wanted were less than half full almost the whole part of my lunch and it had been untouched so it makes me wonder just how long the food had been sitting there. The grilled food had only about 2 or 3 pieces of each type of food baking underneath the hot lamps. It's almost as if you're biting into beef jerky. The sushi and maki tastes fine BUT when they post a sign that you are limited to taking only a few pieces at a time really annoys me. Besides, could someone tell me how the heck I'm supposed to enjoy sushi if I can't dip it into the soy sauce??? (shaking my head!)

Unless I'm absolutely desperate, I will not return back to Spoonful.

{"text":"went there last saturday with my family and friends, good food quality, sashimi and seafoods are fresh and good taste. Service was good, washroom is clean and restaurant is well decorated. I love fresh oyster and shrimp! Best buffet I ever had in Canada?"}
{"text":"Okay so it's a buffet.. which means not every item will be 10/10 best, it's a large selection of mediocre food. I went with a coupon for their dinner ($32.99 for 2 adults with 2 drink purchases), I really appreciated the wider selection in comparison to Mandarin, they had Japanese cheesecake, Italian pastas, mussels 4 ways, sago in taro coconut milk, lobster bisque soup, sweet potato fries and a wide seafood variety. They had a wider variety of sushi but I think Mandarin's sushi tastes fresher. The only thing I noticed is a lot of their products are from Costco such as their pastas but no big deal. The raw seafood selection is definitely good if you like king crabs/oysters.  They give you a 2 hour seating limit which we went over cause the selection was SO wide, when we left there was a huge line at the door, we arrived around 6pm on a Friday evening and left around 8pm. Towards the end of our meal it got BUSY... like so busy the lines for food and ability to even walk around without bumping into someone was difficult however the coupon was only valid for that night so maybe that's why. The only complaint I have is that they ran out of strawberries for their chocolate fondue :( and their pasta station wasn't that good at all, pad thai was weak. Service was good, plates were cleaned quickly and they had a great variety of sauces to compliment the food. 

TIP: SIGN UP FOR THEIR E-MAILS!! I always get buy one get one free coupons or other promotions; they even have this thing where you go and an insurance company gives you an auto quote and you get a free lunch buffet for 2 adults"}
{"text":"This place is not bad... But not the best either to be honest. If all your family likes is buffet, then this is a great place with birthday discounts. Otherwise, it's ok and the service is fine"}
{"text":"Visited Spoonful for a Friday night seafood buffet and I have to say it was pretty good. Items on the buffet ranged from 1 star to 4 stars.

Now, once again, I'm grading on the curve, and comparing Spoonful to other Chinese food buffets, not to Michelin star restaurants - this is not premium east coast oyster bar quality seafood - but I don't think you should have trouble finding a few dishes that you really like, and easily get your money's worth.

For me, I really enjoyed their tiny grilled garlic scallops on the half shell, (which they limit the numbers of and are slow to refill) their tiny-but-tasty-and-piled-high snow crab legs, the butter sauteed shrimp, and a handful of other items, including the lobster tart, which, while not overloaded with lobster, was quite tasty and delivered a good seafood hit, and were constantly kept hot, fresh and replenished.

The place is quite attractive and nicely laid out, with a huge selection that ranged from roasted and grilled items to sushi and sashimi to custom Pad Thai stir-fry to of course the seafood, which is the star.

Throw in a great selection of fresh fruit, chocolate fountain, waffle and pancake bar, lots of gummies and candy for those with kids, and quite a wide range of pastries and cakes, including fresh homemade mini donuts, and there's a little something for everyone.

Will I visit often? Probably not.
Will I go back? Almost certainly."}
{"text":"Great tasting buffet with a wide variety of food. Normally don't like sushi from all you can eat buffets which aren't solely sushi restaurants but this one does a good job. I really enjoyed the dessert options from donuts, waffles,ice cream the list goes on!"}
{"text":"Pretty good,  but very little actual Chinese food.  I would compare it to an Asian themed Golden Corral.   A lot more desserts than Chinese dishes.  Fairly expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"I have been to Spoonful a couple of times and it has always been a great place to celebrate birthdays as they have nice birthday discounts. I came here on Friday night and was surprised that it wasn't as busy as I had expected it to be based on my previous times here. Besides the seafood, I love the meat selection here with quail being one of my favourites as it is rarely found in a buffet. 

The dessert section had one of the best variety of cakes I have seen in a buffet, they look great AND taste great! Of all the cakes, I loved the crispy caramel one the most with its crispy layers sandwiched with caramel in between! 

The service was great, they came often to clear the dishes and frequently refilled our water. Overall, I would come back as this is not a bad place to celebrate special occasions."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch during a weekday with a friend who gave me the recommendation on this place. I'm not too big on Asian AYCE buffets because it's usually \"run of the mill\" food.

Id say that while not \"run of the mill\", Spoonful certainly was what I would expect from an AYCE place.

What I did enjoy was that there was a decent selection of meats at the grill area, since I am allergic to seafood, and won't even risk having any unless I know for sure it was served fresh. I actually enjoyed the Gelato section and had some for dessert with fresh-made waffles and some cut fruit.

The ambiance is kinda cool. Huge ceilings in the dining area don't have you feeling cramped. Service was also quick and friendly.

Yeah, I'd go back again if I didn't have a specific hankering for any particular kind of food."}
{"text":"This is my third time here. I can feel the food quality are going downhill...

Frist, sashimi is warm, yup it's Warm. I can't believed why a bag restaurant  can serve warm sashimi ... 

Everything r average, I don't think I'll be back shortly,"}
{"text":"The food tastes pretty good and the decor is beautiful... 

But I am not really impressed by the selection at spoonful. The best things there are the dessert. The pasta bar takes forever but it does taste good. 

It's also really easy to feel like you're in a traffic jam with their layout unfortunately. 

Lastly don't come here if you want a more romantic dinner for two or anything. If you are unfortunately seated at the tables for two... You're pretty much eating with two other couples since you're just as close to them as you are to your significant other. 

I feel like if you want to pay this price you might as well go to mandarin or wok of flame since they are both close by and much better in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of variety and the food is delicious.  Buffet spot that looks classy and tastes great, well recommended.  Some advice if you come during lunch buffet come early otherwise you will be waiting in line for awhile."}
{"text":"The food was alright I feel there is way more better buffets out there , the place itself is really nice. Wouldn't really go there again since it's such a far drive"}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying that I am not really a big buffet person. My husband gets more out of them with his skinny-dude bottomless pit thing he has going on. That said, as far as buffets go, Spoonful really knocked it out of the park. 

We went only because we were awaiting a tire changeover at Canadian Tire in the same mall. It was pricier than I wanted, but looked like the nicest spot in Shoppers World, so we went for it. The variety was staggering (and explains the price!) and considering it was a buffet, it was well done. I enjoyed the fresh cooking part of it, of course, but everything else I tried was at least good, if not very good. 

The dessert buffet was possibly the most impressive part of the whole thing, just because I have never seen modern design pedestals topped with big bowls of candy!

Service was highly attentive, which I liked. It might even have been too attentive, but we were there at a slow time of day, so I can forgive them for looking for something to do. I'd rather staff err on the side of being over-attentive than totally disappearing. 

Final verdict: if you don't like buffets, this still won't be the place for you. But if you do, you'll really love this one."}
{"text":"Food- 4/5
The food is delicious! Great and different choices compared to some buffets like Mandarin. It would be even better if it had more choices though, especially with the hot foods. The raw seafoods seems great, but if you're not into it, it is mediocre since it's just one booth

Desserts- 4.5/5
The donut machine is a lot more lamer than what people hype it up to be. If u want fresh donuts just head to Krispy Kreme. Other than that, the highlight of the desserts is the ice cream machine

Interior -5/5
The place is packed even on non-holidays & weekdays sometimes. Decor wise, it's pretty with a chill atmosphere. Hopefully they continue to update themselves or else they place will just become a second-rate buffet. Due to the seats and the tables, they cannot move around tables if you are hoping to bring in a large group

Service - 2/5
The worst mark because once they become busy, customers can't be their highest priority which sucks because this can really make or break the overall feel of the place. YOU MUST ALWAYS MAKE A RESERVATION. If not, you will be one of the very last one to enter no matter how early u got there compared to others. Also, make sure your waiter fully understands what you say because they tend to make mistakes, not sure why, but extra communication may help"}
{"text":"Overall, the food was okay...can't expect too much from a buffet.  

I came for the seafood buffet and got my fix...they have someone controlling the number of oysters and scallops you can get lol

Overall, place is busy and noisy with all the chatter but if you want a quick bite to eat, it's a good place.

I found a lot of the food tasted the same...dinner on a Friday night was pretty pricey.  It wouldn't be my first place to go to, but could be an option."}
{"text":"Definitely would return! It's a clean buffet! But go in the evening hours! They have the best fried sushi! Not in the afternoons! 

It kinda took servers long to bring water! But would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If you like Mandarin and Chinese buffets then this is the place for you.  I'm not a huge buffet fan, but if you are looking for variety this place has it. There are tons of items to choose from. The place has most of the items you would expect from a Chinese buffet and more. They have everything from a seafood station, salad station, sushi station, pasta station, meat station, to the dessert station. I was here for the dinner rush on Saturday and it got busy fairly quickly. I suggest making reservations if you go since it gets really busy on the weekend.

The thing that I loved the most was the lobster bisque, which was my favourite dish of the night. If you go, this is a must try! The soup was creamy and smooth with a really nice lobster taste. As an added bonus the bisque contained bits of lobster in it. The one suggestion I would have for the restaurant is that people should be able to get the hot food from both sides of the serving trays. There were long lines for some of the hot food stations. Especially the crab. If you enjoy crab and want lots of it this place is a good choice. Spoonful has two different types of crab: one that is seasoned and normal boiled crab. My family loves crab and they really enjoyed it. 

The dessert stations have a huge selection: ice cream, soft serve ice cream, cakes, cup cakes, jello, fruit, waffles, and I loved the candy station which I thought was really neat - who doesn't love jujubes or candy? My inner kid was delighted."}
{"text":"Celebrated my mom's 81st birthday with a party of 14 people at this venue.  Made reservations 90 minutes before we arrived and we were all seated right on time.  We've all been here before over the years with the biggest visible change being this year; the food choices have diminished a little in main courses, salads, fruits and desserts.  I would say it's mainly because of increased costs..wages, rent, utilities, and definitely food costs (...just look at your own grocery bill).  Still, a high quality buffet lunch for $21.99 is great as I paid $17 for a burger & fries at Scaddabush just the other day.  I concentrated on the Salmon Sashimi...I absolutely love this stuff!!!  The lobster bisque is now less creamy but still my favourite at the soup bar.  Lots of choices for our group to choose from regardless if you're a meat lover or a vegetarian.  Our event totaled 2 hours with attentive staff that took away our plates before we returned with another plate of food.  Service was very good.  This place didn't disappoint again as I would come here in a heart beat over going to a Mandarin Restaurant.  BTW, don't be surprised if the Server informs you that the bill is a cash price...more if you're using plastic to pay.  We had our $350 cash ready.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Crablegs here are very fresh, one of the only places where you can eat crablegs during any day of the week. Extremely large selection of different foods, mostly asian but several other types of cuisines as well. The waiters and waitresses are extremely kind and helpful. Great promotions as they offer a 10% discount if you share a photo of your experience on social media."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best AYCE I've ever been to. It's fantastic! The food was amazing! The selection was fantastic! The service was great! The decor is beautiful! 

Complaints.....ummmm, it's a little pricy....BUT its worth it because the food is great! 
I will go back here FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"Personally, I just don't really like buffets and my own personal bias would give it a 2 rating since I really don't feel it's worth the money. But, bearing in mind that I have to review it for what it is, 3 seems fair enough. Like virtually every 'Chinese' buffet, most dishes are fairly mediocre and not a great deal of taste. I've learned to take smaller portions and then go back to something if it stands above

Since my visit was several weeks ago, I can only remember that the sushi was pretty good and that they're preparing it right on site. They also offered a few other meat choices that you may not find elsewhere, such as duck.

It does have the best ambiance of any comparable buffet I've been to, and I liked how they went with the Halloween theme when I was there by having lots of candy to choose from."}
{"text":"Overhyped.... Food is mediocre at best. You can only get your monies worth if you enjoy seafood. Great dessert selection though"}
{"text":"Really crowded.  Really long wait, Really overrated, and basically most of the buffet was candies and desserts.  What I did eat was \"meh!\" But nothing deserving a big review. For the price you can get a much better buffet at wok of fame or tandoori flame."}
{"text":"Huge selection of foods. 
There's a salad bar, sushi bar, create-your-own Japanese soba noodles, the roasted/grilled food section, soup section, fried rice, and noodles section, customizable live cooking pad thai and pasta section, crab legs and an assortment of other meat, seafood, and vegetable dishes (and the typical fries, pizza, and onion rings that appear at buffets).  There are labelled vegetarian options which was great for me!

The dessert selection consisted of a  variety of fruits (typical offers of pineapple, orange slices, strawberries, grapes etc...). My younger cousins enjoyed the fresh donuts that you can top with chocolate sauce, butterscotch sauce, icing sugar, or cinnamon sugar. They also appreciated the fresh crepe's and waffles. There's a huge variety of cakes, pies, custards, and cookies and other baked treats. 

The coolest thing that my family liked was the huge variety of ice cream. You can choose between soft serve or the harder kind of ice cream that comes in several different flavour. There's also a candy bar which was nice for the kids. 

The funniest thing I saw was the crowd of kids at the chocolate fountain. 

The staff are very nice and they don't rush you to finish like other buffets (Mandarin, Dragon Pearl). 

I took off a star because of the crazy line-up. 

Make reservations because it gets crazy busy."}
{"text":"Holy crap this resto is huge!! I went with a group of 8 and we had to wait for about 10 mins to get seated but luckily we got put into the VIP room so double the awesome! I was so amazed with the amount of selection and there were always some fresh food coming out. 

Post a picture on Facebook, Wechat or Instagram to get 10% off but has to be paid in cash only."}
{"text":"This whole restaurant is based on you consuming seafood. If you don't like seafood - this is not the place for you because it cuts your variety down to less than half the restaurant. We got in around 5:30-5:40 so we had zero wait time, the place was already packed and the food was fresh. 

I was happy here and left feeling extremely full but I would never go back. It lacks in variety and focuses purely on seafood. 

Food:
Crab legs, mussels, shrimp, the sea snail, oysters, snails in cream sauce,lobster pie, baked mussels with cheese, baked oyster with morning glory, teriyaki clams, torpedo shrimp (best I've ever had) and baked sole.All delicious. There is a seafood lady who will give you the oysters, sea snails and scallops. She keeps moving around so I noticed some had to search for her.

There was a huge selection of roasted meats. I got to try the pork belly - let me tell you that this was porky, juicy, melted in your mouth and that skin was sooooo crunchy - exactly like its suppose to be. I got the steak with onions - the steak literally melts as you chew.

I also tried the soba station which was delish! Mango tango ice cream tastes like its from Baskin Robbins which was another plus point. 

Let's talking about the downfalls:
Not much variety in terms of carbs - very few noodle/rice options. The restaurant isn't very well organized in the least. There are people sitting in the food area when generally they quarantine the food in a central location and the tables are placed on the outside. This caused the dessert section to be disjointed, the gummy candy section to be beside the chilled seafood and random soup in random areas. 

Dessert section wasn't what I hoped it would be and was subpar. The fruits were probably the best part which is really sad.

Decor:
I liked it - it felt alittle upscale and reminded me of spoon and fork. Bathrooms are clean and trendy. Plates always seemed to have alittle water on them and in the food stations - you quite literally had to hunt abit for plates I found.

Service: 
It was really good. My plate of crab shells or finished food never sat near me for long - constantly emptying them and filling my water. It was great never having to ask for anything besides the bill and a crab cracker. Everyone is really friendly and you get the vibe they are having fun. 

Overall:
If you are going for variety - head to wok of fame. They have more selection, much better desserts and things make sense in terms of getting your food. 

If you love seafood - this is for you and you will enjoy the experience. 

Do I think this place is worth the price - yes because they heavily specialized in seafood. If you aren't big on seafood - this is a waste of money. 

Even though it was a good experience with good food - I would never go back. I recommend this as a one time experience. Go for the thrill of the fresh seafood."}
{"text":"I don't do buffets often, but this place is actually pretty decent for buffets. 

They have a sushi section, regular chinese food section, cook/meet served section, dessert, soup, pastas and ice cream/waffles. 

Buffets usually don't offer great food, so I didn't have high expectations. Nothing really blew my mind. There are a couple of things that I really didn't enjoy:

1.  Pad thai - they have a cook who makes the pad thai for you once you fill out the order form. They tell you to come back in five minutes to pick up your order. They are pretty good with their timing. However, the pad thai tasted horrible. It was too sweet and they put too much sauce that it taste like sweet ketchup. Not tasteful at all.
2. They had some really weird baked oysters...but it was so bitter and salty at the same time! I usually enjoy oysters but this was by far my worst experience with oyster

Some of the things that I did enjoy are the waffle/crepe section. You can add ice cream on top. They also have variety of fresh fruits that you can dip in their white chocolate fountain. I didn't try their dessert/cake sections. Usually, it's just full of sugar so I didn't bother.

For $20.99 lunch buffet, I think it's okay. Although hey offer a variety of food, they are mostly tasteless and need a lot of improvement."}
{"text":"Lacking, Packed, stuffy, full

The place is wayyyy too packed... And with no room to walk for food. Beyond ridiculous lines for food. 

The food is mediocre, huge selections but nothing is in order, short staffed and food always runs out. Plates, bowls are constantly missing for customers. One set of tongs for 8 people,rarely cleaned counters and never restocking cutlery.

The seafood is okay,rather small feels like you're more like eating shells then you are reading meat.

Sushi was still frozen when I picked up the fish.

SERVICE was okay, friendly and generally ask you if you need something.

Honestly not worth 33 per person if you enjoy this type of buffet mandarin is nice, but any sushi buffet can outbeat spoonful 100 times."}
{"text":"I came for my cousins birthday get together.  The food was pretty good and the selection was very diverse.  I would say it is better than the average buffet.  The venue was very nice as well.  Service was ok for a buffet.  Dishes were removed quite quickly after each plate.

Food 4/5
Price 3.5/5
Venue 4.5/5
Service 4/5"}
{"text":"We got seated right away in one of the main dining rooms -- this place is huge!  We took a stroll along the food aisles first and I was so amazed with the selection and gorgeous ways that everything was displayed!  I was so excited too since everything seemed so dazzling. 

First, we walked past the dessert aisles; there were so many dessert selections!  I was amazed with how the ice cream selection was displayed.  It was like a merry-go-around but for ice cream!  You would ask the assistant there to help you scoop your ice cream for you.

We started off with the bite-sized items and main courses.  I was blown away with the selection of unique items that they had.  Such items included duck rolls, cheesy crab bake, an assortment of cheese tarts, mac and cheese lobster, cheesy baked oyster, cheesy escargot, stir-fried crabs, frog legs (!), pogo sticks, a custom Pad Thai and custom pasta station, and so much more in between.  Close to this, there was also the station for fried rice, plain rice, and noodles.

After this, we encountered the barbecue meat section.  Little did I know that Spoonful is actually a Asian-themed buffet and that's why I saw so many Asian dishes!  They had roasted pork, barbecue pork, beef, lamb, roasted chicken, roasted grapefruit, roasted zucchini, roasted eggplant, Hungarian sausage, red sausage, marinated egg, seared scallop, and so much more!  It was beautiful.

Next up, we walked past the sushi section.  Mmm, all-you-can-eat sashimi!  There was a friendly sign there reminding all patrons to only take three pieces of sashimi per visit.  The sushi rolls and maki rolls were made beautifully and presented so nicely too!  I couldn't believe how nice the sushi rolls looked.  Usually at buffets, the sushi are very ordinary and non-descript.  Here though, all the sushi looked like the ones that you would order and receive at an a la carte restaurant.  There was also an entire section for vegetarian sushi too.  (Which reminds me, they also had a lot of variety of items of vegetarian appetizers and mains too.)

The salad bar was next and this included lots of fresh salad, dressings, and lots of Asian-inspired salads too including a Thai fried egg which I had never seen before, black fungus, salad, and more.

Opposite to the salad bar, there was a chilled food section which included the ever popular smoked salmon, smoked duck (rare to see), cubed cheese (they didn't have any of those sliced cheese here), pickles, preserved fruits, crackers, soba noodles, cold noodles, clams, and whelks too.  It was very plentiful!

There was soup and chilled seafood too!  There was really so much here that despite taking so many photos, there are still some spots I missed.  This might be the most extensive buffet restaurant I've ever been to. 

That night, we enjoyed most of everything that the buffet could offer; at least what we could fit into our stomachs anyway. 

The highlights that night for me were the frog legs (so good!!!  Juicy and tender), fried chicken wings (perfectly fried the way I like them), and the seared lamb and beef (these were so juicy, well-seasoned, and nicely cooked!).  I enjoyed the juicy and fresh cucumbers too. I liked the lobster bisque and the Chinese soup (?????) that they had!

I also was able to nab a raw oyster that I saw them putting them out.  It was funny because just as I was thinking that the only thing missing from this buffet would be raw oysters, I saw them come out!  Again, these were limited to two per person.  The raw oysters here were huge!  Unfortunately, I didn't find it very fresh though. 

They had a multi-tiered chocolate fountain too!  This buffet literally has everything!

The chocolate cake and truffle was too sweet for my taste even though I enjoy chocolate cakes.

They also have a homemade donut making machine! 

I loved the fact that there was no time limit to the dinner buffet."}
{"text":"This place is pricey, and some of the food is limited by trip.  I really don't like that, it's a buffet they should have as much as possible for guests.  Don't go there on holidays you will have to line up for all the food groups and the 2 hours limit is gone in a flash."}
{"text":"Food was okay and selection was pretty good. Our server on the other hand was pretty crap. It took a while to clear our plates. Upon paying the bill she counts the money in front of us and asks if that was all we were giving. Saying she should get more tip than what we gave. But we told her the service wasn't good and she didn't even give us water because we ordered drinks. Usually at restaurants you also get water on top of the ordered drinks but nope got nothing. Then after that she walks away and smacks her tray against the wall. Extremely unhappy about the service and will definitely not be coming back.

A day that was meant to be a happy birthday celebration ended on a bad note because of that one server. Don't waste your time and money -- better off going to Mandarin."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-4

Food-3
Strikeouts-0/3

When walking into the restaurant, it doesn't seem like any special, or even similar to the pics you see posted. However, after walking around to see what this buffet has the offer, the layout and work they put into their display is above the standard places like Mandarin. 

Service here was spot on, but how can you screw up In a buffet right? They took our drink orders quickly and got back promptly. The dishes disappeared as we left for more food. The only gripe here is not taking away used tissues unless it was on the plate.

Food wise, the seafood variety was a bit lacking. Yes it has, raw oysters, scallops, conch shells, mussels and crab legs, but I feel they could do more. Especially since hey advertise as being a seafood buffet. The Japanese section was definitely exquisite. It had a huge variety of rolls, and the quality wasn't lacking either. The slices on sashimi were a bit thin though, making the taste differently. There was a DIY soba station, soups of many variety(thumbs up!), and the cooked section was definitely up there. This place's BBQ section seemed better than the seafood section, which appeases the western culture. 

I overall would recommend going to this place once for special occasions, but definitely not worth traveling for."}
{"text":"The quality of the food isn't great. This place is nothing special to be honest. 

Pros: 
- a huge variety of foods, especially desserts
- nice washroom and smells nice!
- good service
- clean

Cons:
- they seem leave the food out for a while and not put in fresh food often. There were many times I ate cold food
- the Japanese cheese was moist and mushy @_@
- the Mantou, chinese steamed bun, was HARD AF like rock hard
- the baked scallop was cold and salty
- some foods I thought was salty or bland
- generic, nothing too special?
- if you're using a coupon or have discount for birthdays, they will not accept credit/debit and ONLY cash so please remember that!"}
{"text":"Buffet is good, but honestly a few items looked like they were sitting out all day or were cold. The price you pay is quite steep even for all you can eat. I had to chase down a server to pay my bill so I could leave. My daughter (6mos) started to meltdown and I just wanted to get out of there as to not disturb other customers. I tried paying at the front as I couldn't find anyone and was told \"someone would be around eventually. Okay food with terrible service. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Probably the worse place I've eaten in past year and I think I have a short memory because this place is a real shithole.   Frozen and processed food in abundance if that's your thing.   Beef?  Sorry none.   Chicken?  Sorry just one kind covered with teriyaki sauce and same breaded chicken in the pasta.   

So the bright side.   Always a bright side, right?  A \"rotating ice cream bar\".... ta da.....  that's the wow.   Try not to miss it.   

Will I be back? Haha.....  would be a good place for a joke but unfortunately I have to run and find some real food for dinner as this crap isn't worth it."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and finding out this used to be an imperial Buffett, I was a bit apprehensive to visit. Our group visited for lunch and there was 10 people. This place is great for large groups!

I was surprised at the size of the restaurant. The selection was huge. From braised lamb to a sushi bar! Note that drinks are extra (soft drinks should be included for the price).

I tried to have some of all the options but there are so many! Lots of seafood so if you are allergic to shell fish, might not be a good place for you! Not a fan of Asian food? They have a lot of varieties for food. They have a pho station made to your liking, lots of BBQ and skillet cooked meats! There is something for everyone! The sushi bar had a lot of non fish options but they did serve sashimi at lunch which was surprising to see! The variety even spilled into the desserts! Fresh waffles, tiny Tom donuts like you get at CNE, even a spinning wheel of ice cream.

Serves have no personality, but I guess they are more plate-take-awayers more than anything else. 

This place is a must try! I find it funny that there is only two locations, one in China and one on Brampton! Go figure

Some of my fav dishes:
BBQ chicken
Button mushrooms
Fried rice
Pad Thai noodles
And the sushi - someone stated the sashimi is cut thin but what else would you expect? It's all you can eat!

Will def. visit again for their dinner to see the variety between lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday night and the restaurant was half empty. First of all, the food was marginally better than the average buffet and the dessert was better than the average buffet. But if you go for the lobster on the weekend, then you might be disappointed. The baked lobster with cheese was way too salty, and over cooked. Not worth the price premium on weekends. The line up for the lobster was less than 10 minutes. Secondly, the service was good too, had frequent water refills and plates taken away."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The food is good for a buffet style  restaurant. Good selection. The seafood bar is quite nice with a good selection of crab, shrimp, mussels, oysters, etc. Spoonful markets itself as the gourmet buffet. I found nothing gourmet, but it was good."}
{"text":"A tad expensive but the selection of food is amazing! Good promo for birthdays and overall the ambiance is great"}
{"text":"Highlights from my night: smoked duck meat, buttery raw scallops, fresh salmon sashimi, sweet crab legs, soft serve ice cream

Disappointments: overcooked meatless lobsters, sandy oysters, hardly refilled clams, cramped seating area, the long drive to Brampton, spoons ran out (not so spoon-full!)"}
{"text":"Typical buffet food. Don't expect really good tasting food. Oysters were delicious. Ice cream was good. The rest was meh."}
{"text":"I like the table setting.. The buffet has almost every kind of food you can think of. From seafood to pasta, different kinds of salads, sushi.. freshly made doughnuts? They have a section where you can make your own soft serve ice cream. They have 3 flavors to choose from and lots of sprinkles that u can add on top..beside the DIY soft serve ice cream is the gelato corner where as far as I can remember has 8 flavors,... cakes, slices, fresh fruits,  chocolate fountain!... my mouth drools just at the sight of it... we felt like we were kids again.. 
They have a section where you can request for a pad thai and they are going to cook it however you would like it... Unfortunately they don't put peanuts, which is pretty disappointing. What's a pad thai without peanuts?.. or any kind of nuts?. I think for 23CAD plus tax is not bad for the price you pay that you can eat everything you want. Sadly I don't have the huge tank of storage in my tummy.. so I ended up just admiring some of the food.. it's amazing how people can go for more. . Like.. from one plate after another after another. . After another. . :)"}
{"text":"all food are sub-par even comparing to other AYCE buffers in Brampton. 

shrimps, mussels not taste fresh comparing to Mandarin. only thing i like is octopus.

They are emphasizing Wed night is seafood night, but one person can only get two cooked clam and oysters at end of long wait. the line for crawfish is ridiculously long, when the tray finally come out, yhey r gon within 2 mins.

sashimi r horrible  my stomachfeel funny afterwards.

desserts tasted coming dire from Costco, been sitting there for ages

they should really change up their menu options, yes, they are hundreds items to choose from, feel half r desserts, ice cream and candies. there is no signature dish to attract return customers"}
{"text":"I usually try not to go to ayce or buffet style restaurants, but this was a special occasion.  My friend was having his weddings lunch reception there.  However I was pleasantly surprised at the amount and variety of food at this place.  Notably, there were salmon sashimi, spinach quiches, a chocolate fountain, make your own pasta bar, escargot tarts, a candy bar in addition to the regular fixings of a normal buffet.  The food quality was not the greatest, but as to be expected from a buffet style restaurant.  For example, a few pieces of the salmon sashimi had bone bits in it and their lobster tart was horrendous.  But, they also had a chocolate fountain and made egg waffles.  So it evened out.  I probably won't visit this place again as I dislike overconsumption and wasting of food, but it was worth a try."}
{"text":"This place is a really cool addition to the Brampton buffet marketplace! Great decor and good food. Especially if you love seafood as much as I do. It's so rare to find a buffet that's not just Chinese food and sushi and so to have a combination like this of all types of cuisine was really cool!

It's almost worth the visit for the dessert alone. Cool rotating ice cream thing, frozen yogurt, soft serve, a candy station, hot \"Tiny Tom\" style donuts, a chocolate fountain, and the freshest fruit I've ever found at any buffet ever.

Loses a star for the lacklustre \"Brazilian churrasco grill\" that I had much higher hopes for and though the Chinese food is pretty good, Mandarin or Wok of Fame are both better in that category.

Also, the terrible jazz musak was out of place. It has a really cool modern feel in there, put on some light electronic or something! But that's just me being picky."}
{"text":"This is pretty much as good as buffets get if you're looking for a little bit of everything and don't want to go to Mandarin. There is a huge selection of seafood, so definitely worth it if you're a seafood lover. For myself, I am a huge dessert foodie and this place hits just the right spots. A rotating ice cream bar (someone will scoop what you want for you) with unique and creative flavours along with the regulars, FRESH mini donuts (amazing when you sprinkle icing sugar and hot caramel on top), a complete candy bar, fruits galore, a strawberry milkshake machine, and everything else in between (tiramisu, creme brûlée, mousse, etc).

Aside from Chinese food, there is also some delicious pasta. You get a 50% discount if it's your birthday month. It's $22 for lunch on a weekend and $33 for dinner. They even charge children 4 and under which I find a little unreasonable at those prices. I live nowhere close to Brampton, but this is the place I would go if I'm looking for a buffet."}
{"text":"The problem with being vegan and getting asked to go to an all-you-can-eat buffet is that you always have the fear of paying 40 bucks to eat white rice and cucumber sushi. I was VERY hesitant to come check out Spoonful because of the steep price (32.99+tax for dinner on Friday-Sunday), but I'm glad I came because there were actually many vegan friendly choices available! It is mainly a seafood buffet, but they had a wide selection of cooked food and their dessert bar was intense. Their quality of food is not stellar as it is with  the majority of buffets, but their immense selection of food was very impressive.. and I can't say the food tasted horribly. The reason for the 4 star rating is definitely because of their variety, not their quality. I definitely don't think I will be returning anytime soon because it is nearly impossible for me to eat 40 bucks worth of vegetables, but I recommend this place for large groups looking to accommodate many different diets. Definitely one of the better buffets out there, much better than Dragon Legend."}
{"text":"One of the yummiest buffet restaurants we go to, this was our second visit. We came here around 2 years ago, and things have definitely changed since then..for the better. They have limited how many oysters/raw seafood you can have per plate per person. They have a designated person stationed to serve you. The only negative was the weirdly depressing/rude ice cream lady who was gave major attitude when asking for 2 different flavours in 1 bowl. It must have been SO much extra work to scoop. She felt the need to roll her eyes and rudely hand the bowl back to us. How is someone serving ice cream THAT angry? She definitely had a major chip on her shoulder for ice cream. Anyways, there are some dishes that they are super picky about only taking 2 pieces and jump on you for taking more even though we're just using 1 plate for 2 people.

Still one of my favourite places in this area to go for special occasions, food is very good and lots of variety compared to some buffet chains. Service was prompt and no mistakes were made."}
{"text":"Second time back, guess what? They elevated their quality of soft serve icecream! Maybe someone read my yelp review? Nice job Spoonful!"}
{"text":"Well, I went here for a birthday. First things first, reservations aren't always honored depending on how busy the restaurant is. I actually did make a reservation to spoonful and found out I'd be waiting for about an hour and a half before a table was opened despite having made one.

When we were finally in, we were seated and had to wait quite a while for a server to come around and serve us some wine as the entire table was celebrating a birthday. This frustrated some of us, but I for the most part was fine with the wait.... Despite the hour and a half to be seated.

Anyway, onto the food... It's AYCE (All You Can Eat) so it sort of speaks for itself. There are small portions of the restaurant that churn out food right in front of you and you get to decide whether or not you want it. Kind of like live cooking, except you're not really picking the meal and asking the chef to prepare it, they already are behind the grill.

The rest of the food was sub-par. I say this because I've eaten at a lot of AYCE restaurants and they all have the same ambiance. Stack a pile of food on your plate, head back to your table and chow down. 

One thing I would like to suggest to this place is that they need to restructure how reservations are done, and queue walk in visits a lot better than the current system allows. It appears to be a broken system based on first come first serve as opposed to any reservations."}
{"text":"Currently the best buffet in the GTA. It just has to be. 

Spoonful is a new buffet located in the northeast corner of Shopper's World in Brampton. 

It's owned by the same owners of Imperial Buffet in Mississauga. If there's one thing the owners know how to do, it's attract lots of people, and fast. When Imperial opened in Mississauga, word quickly swept the city and before long, the restaurant was packed daily. The same thing seems to be happening at Spoonful. 

I hosted family member's birthday party here this past weekend. We had a reservation at 12pm - basically, at the beginning of the lunch rush. It was not too crowded when we came but the lineups grew fast. By my 2nd plate I was waiting in line for 10 minutes for the hot food table. I can see how this can be an annoyance for some, but personally I looked at it positively in that it gave me a longer break between plates. If this is a problem for you, the I'd suggest coming for lunch a little later or earlier, and avoid 12-1pm altogether. 

It's really in terms of food where Spoonful stands out. They have foods that I've never tasted at buffets in the GTA before. Seafood bar, complete with oysters, snails, shrimps, mussels, and clams? Check. Soba noodle bar? Check. Sushi that's actually decent? Check (though lacking in variety on the sashimi front). Freshly grilled meats? Check. Churrasca pineapple (yes, the same kind that you have at Brazilian steakhouses)? Check. Made to order pasta and noodle bar? Check. And that's not even touching dessert. 

Their have two huge tables dedicated to dessert. Fresh waffles and crepes, cakes, pies, cookies, brownies, ice cream, fruits, chocolate fountain, candy stations - they have it all. They even have a donut machine, where fresh donuts are made at 1pm for lunchtime every day. Amazing. 

It's clear that Spoonful separates itself from the competition by letting you try foods that you wouldn't normally have at buffets. It's unique in that sense. I'd rank the quality of their food highly too, definitely at least as good as Wok of Fame. Their service is excellent - they were very accommodating and friendly. At this point, I see nothing but good things in Spoonful's future. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I went last nite (Sat) with a party of four adults, one six year old, one two year old and a seven month old. I tried to make reservations for six thirty but the man who answered the phone informed me that it was first come first serve during the peek hours.  We showed up at the restaurant at seven twenty and entered what can only be described as an organized mess of hungry Asians waiting for a table. 

Tip 1: Seven twenty on Sat nite is not a good time for Spoonful, especially if you are starving.  

The front desk staff were courteous and friendly despite the mayhem and quickly added me to the waiting list stating that it would be about a forty minutes. Not bad considering the amount of my bredrin that were packed into the front waiting area.   So off we went, my Bae Nikki and I, leaving behind our friends and family to begin our pre-table eat. 

Tip 2:  \"Blending In\".  Straight to the bar and grab a Coors Light.  Casually enter buffet area and grab a plate for you and your Bae. Now own it.  

We toured the buffet eating as we walked around. How sweet the taste of food.  Our faces stained with sauce we returned to our friends and family who managed to find a seat in the crazily packed waiting room. I bought another Beer for my buddy and we waited patiently for our table. Twenty minutes later we were seated and eating.  OMGoodness. The crazy line ups for food. 

Tip 3:  \"The Art of Budding\".   Lol. In and out fast. You find the hole in the line and boom, hit it. Some people tend to take their sweet a$$ time when taking food from the buffet which causes the \"Hole Effect\".  It is when a space opens up in the buffet line and a skilled Ninja, such as myself, can swoop in, grab and swoop out before anyone notices. Sometimes even staying in that position in the line. Remember this, OWN IT. 

Well like most every reviewer before me, Spoonful is good. Food is tasty. Seafood section is aight. Try to avoid prime hours. The servers can try harder at cleaning off the tables. Water was refilled promptly. I sweets, candy and ice cream selection was good. Especially \"The Wheel of Ice Cream Fortune\" thingy.  The buffet lines died down at around nine o'clock. Everything in with tax and tip was Two Hundred and ten dollars. Four adults and,,,,,, whatever. Yelpers I salute you."}
{"text":"I went here last night specifically to try the seafood and was utterly disappointed. I understand that it's a buffet so I obviously did't except top quality seafood but what was available was not even edible in my opinion. The \"fresh\" oysters appeared to be frozen beforehand and had a strange after taste - as if they were preshucked and then stuck in a freezer so they can absorb all the funny smells and tastes and then taken out once they were needed. The scallops also tasted similar. The cold crab legs were sweet however I think they were old or overcooked because it was nearly impossible to get at the meat without using a toothpick to pick it all out. The snails were difficult to extract and when I was able to get the bugger out, it just tasted like rubber. I didn't bother with the cold shrimp or mussels after that. 

The hot foods selection is pretty limited. There was sushi & sashimi, \"Canadian\" chinese food, and brazilian bbq available. The sushi & sashimi looked like it had been sitting out for quite a long time that the sashimi was starting to turn to mush. The rolls were okay, similar to what you would get at most AYCE places although the selection was very limited to various veggie rolls and a couple rolls with fish. 

The dessert selection was defintely the winner in this buffet. They had lots of Asian and Canadian desserts available from mago pudding, almond cookies, and caramel flan to red velvel cupcakes and a chocolate fondu fountain. I'd almost say the desserts alone took up maybe half the entire buffet! 

If you have a sweet tooth, then I would recommend this buffet otherwise save your money and go to sushi 168 for better sushi & crab legs."}
{"text":"Great buffet food quality and selection

Sushi / sashimi ok -not 5 star but still good

Pork siu mai was so so. 

All the rest were good. Ribs were good. 

Reminds me of Toronto's dragon legend. 

If you are in the area then it is worth a try if you have buffet at 16-22 dollars. Call in to reserve esp during holidays. Birthday celebrant and paying cash allows some discounts."}
{"text":"Quality has gone WAY DOWN from when they opened. The food tastes like over-heated food that has been served again and again for days, the desserts are border-line stale and fruits are not ripe. The price is too expensive for the food, dessert, with no ambience (but it is spacious and I'll only give them that). Please stay away, spend that money somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place used to be VERY good when it  first opened (I think 2013?).  I came here at least a good 5 times since opening to now, mind you I live in Markham, so it's a decent drive to go all the way to Brampton to eat here.  I'm very disappointed to say everytime i come back, the food gets worst and worst, and today marks the last time I will probably ever come back.

First, the waiter we had was horrendous, doesn't say thank you, doesn't smile, doesn't say anything.  Maybe he was in a bad mood, but no matter how you feel, as a waiter you are supposed to serve.  I never seen a waiter come with plastic tray, put it in your face without saying anything and expects you to put the \"finished\" plates on the tray for him.  like for REAL?  O, I should also mention when I asked for a refill for my coke, it took 15 mins to arrive and yes, he puts the tray in my face and expected me to take the cup myself off his tray when his other hand is holding NOTHING.

Second, I used to be super impressed with their seafood table and their sushi table.  Today when I went, sushi is nowhere close to how it was, and the oysters and scallops... well the scallops were alright (just some sand still in there), the oysters was not cold enough and I ate one and didn't want to risk it and eat more.  It didn't taste fresh either (noticed the oysters weren't as good already last time I came here).

Third, the tiny donuts, they used to be so well made, now they are just super greasy and no one really watches that machine anymore to ensure all donuts are at least decent looking.  I have to say the rest of their desserts, ice creams and candies are still decent.  (If you go wrong with candies too, then that is depressing)

I can go on and on and on, but all i have to say is, this place is no longer the one I came here so often last year.  Only food I would recommend is the Lobster Bisque, Lobster tarts and the prime rib. 

I will probably not make the drive to come here ever again unless I see significant improvements on here through the reviews."}
{"text":"Well, it is one of the better buffets in GTA for sure! My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on Monday.


Such a huge place, I don't even want to imagine it being packed. The staff was very quick with taking away empty plates! We were aware that certain premium items are not available for lunch during the week. The seafood was fresh, all the grilled stuff was freshly prepared ( I only took pieces when the food was just ready to be served). Tons of dessert, but they are OK. The only thing I liked from their dessert section was soft serve. They do have a waffle and a crepe station...they use the same batter for both of them. Crepes were more like pancakes haha, oh well shouldn't expect too much from a buffet right? 

Overall, a lot of options to choose from, I would only recommend certain items though (grilled or roasted meats and veggies, salad bar, seafood, and hot food section). Wish they could focus more on the quality of the desserts, not quantity. Will I come back? probably not. But it was fun to pig out."}
{"text":"Good food quality and has a wide variety of dishes. The atmosphere was great. You should make a reservation if you plan to go on the weekend as the lineup could get quite long."}
{"text":"They used to be very good before but not anymore. Food lacks quality and taste. Better than Mandarin though."}
{"text":"Two words that could describe my experience at Spoonful are: Below average

The biggest drawback of Spoonful is that it promises something that it couldn't deliver. On the surface you are promised with all you can eat king crab leg, oyster and scallop while in reality you are presented with king crab leg that taste mushy and scarcely stocked oyster (which tasted very slimey) and scallop (to be fair, this is the best tasting of the bunch). You literally have you go back second, third, fourth and fifth time around (and maybe running this time) to have any sighting of oyster or scallop. The restaurant was barely full yet you have better chances of have alien sighting than the oyster at Spoonful.  

Warm food quality is turning up to be just subpar. Live cooking station is simply 'anything goes to the grill' station. You'd find beef, octopus, chicken, shrimp, vegetables, etc goes to the grill. I'm not sure what to expect but they tasted exactly as I'd expect - just average both in presentation and taste.You could simply produce the same food by simply throwing anything to your grill with a little soy sauce. Yes it's that kind of cooking. 

Coming around to 'sushi station' the story does not brighten up. There is a well stocked Salmon sashimi. Upon tasting however - the salmon taste a little on the firm side which seems to suggest it has spend its time in the freezer for quiet some time. 

The only salvation on this place is variety of food. However that variety comes up at a steep trade offs with food quality."}
{"text":"I had lunch at spoonful kinda busy, very poor quality in food. After the 1st plate I lost my appetite felt like I was going to hurl. As for dessert just decent ice cream, brownies & mini cupcakes suck! After paying the bill I've noticed the complimentary mints had imperial buffet labeled. That's when I realized it's sh#! been to imperial buffet in the past total garbage food no different with spoonful buffet. Pls don't waste your $ spend it elsewhere, way to expensive mandarin is way better, much more affordable at lunch. Highly not recommend never returning back!"}
{"text":"RATING FOR CATERED FOOD:

Went to a health seminar that was catered by Spoonful. Menu included: fried rice, chow mein (thin noodles), fried chicken, shrimp tempura, sweet and sour pork and mixed steamed veggies. Visually appealing, fast food quality Chinese food with less oil and less seasoning. Nothing stood out as amazing but it was free so I can't complain. My friend was disappointed because they didn't have sushi; she says they have really good sushi."}
{"text":"Sunday: Food was good. Lots of parking. Front desk was packed since my party went on Mother's Day. We had reservations for 13 in advance and it still took a wait time for about an hour. Food was good. I personally think it is better then other buffets in Brampton. The servers were kind of slow brining drinks out but again. It was busy on Mother's Day, but I am making excuses for them. Quick to bring out napkins and we requested hot boiling water to warm up a infants bottle. Had to request about 3 times. 
Overall experience was good and I would come again. Maybe the next time the wait time would be shorter in the front even with reservations..."}
{"text":"Another buffet I tried the in place of mandarin. Actually did not expect much but turned out to be a good experience.Very nice looking at inside and I found the food to be very good. Price also seemed fair. They checked my parents id for the senior discount and gave them the senior price even thought they fell just short of the age. It was a nice gesture to see that and a bonus point to return. But not sure if that is their policy or just up to the server lol. Nevertheless, good place and good food and definitely open to return."}
{"text":"Chicken wings and desserts were good and they were the only good things in this $35 per person buffet.

Went there for the crab legs which were small and then theres a person serving them who limits you to 2 crab legs per plate and when I took more the old Chinese lady started yelling and said only 2 only 2 2, I said yeah only 22 crablegs that's what I'm taking, then she yells and says no read sign says take only 2, then I said hey lady when I made the reservation no one said there was a limit on the food, crab legs sucked anyways when they're that small they don't crack properly

The same sign applied to the oysters and scallops

Steak was dry and over cooked

Lamb had sweet sauce on it and was more chewy than a piece of gum

Ribs were covered in sauce because they were probably from a goat the meat nasted disgusting

Sushi was typical for a buffet 

Soups were watered down

Fruit and salads were fresh and most desserts looked home made the other half were bought and were sweating from the heat in the restaurant

Me and my family and extended family will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Been Twice.. Great both times.. I really wonder why so many people say they don't like this and have only a couple reviews. I notice people with many reviews all agree its good.

 Both time's I went it was great. I think best buffet hands down in Brampton. I suggest everyone check this place. May want to look at buffet before you decide to buy in. I went one time and the had lobster and crab for lunch. They mentioned it was a promotional day. The other time was still just as good minus lobster dishes and crab. I like this place."}
{"text":"No receptionist when we enter, worst customer service. Just left the place, reservation is not on time. Needs staff on a weekend parties. Long line up. People are getting mad."}
{"text":"Kind of comes off to me like a poor mans Mandarin

At first it all looks good, with a nice selection, but a lot of corners are cut

Chicken items are almost entirely dark meat to cut costs. Desserts are bland as hell and extremely generic , taken out of cardboard boxes filled with preservatives and put on display. Yes, they leave the boxes blatantly advertising they are store bought products stacked right behind the desserts out of laziness and it cheapens the whole experience

I can't really think of a single thing Spoonful does better than the Mandarin at pretty much the same cost, except that they offer delicious short ribs and Mandarin doesn't.

2.5 stars"}
{"text":"The one star is for the seafood bar and that's it.

Nice decor however found it tight in the food area dodging people with plates in hand.

The seafood bar is nice b/c you do not see it on a regular basis. Clams, oysters, mussels, snails, shrimp and crab definietly a nice touch if you are a seafood lover.

Everything else was hella salty, the sushi was not that great and they definitely get a fail on the sashimi b/c of the BONES. They did not take them out in the salmon. 

Would I go back most likely not, even if it was for free.

Items to definitely get:

-anything from the seafood bar, take advantage"}
{"text":"Too bad it's so far from where I live or else I'll be there every month. In hindsight, that's a good thing for my health and weight. Lol.

On the weekend, for dinner, we paid $42 per person which included tax, tip, and no drinks. You get a 10% off if it's your bday month.

Amazing variety of food and super delicious. I kept going back for raw scallops and oysters. The scallops were good, and the oysters were ok. They were very meaty and big, but I could tell it wasn't the freshest, like you would get at oyster boy or shucking it yourself. It tasted like it was shuck awhile ago. But trust me, it didn't prevent me from stuffing my stummy still! 

Grilled food was amazing! Honestly, their best feature. Amazing grilled beef, lamb, ribs, and duck. The Hainanese chicken was so silky! 

The Sushi bar was ok. The rolls were mediocre and the sashimi was ok. 

They had a soba noodle bar, donut machine, gummy stations, soft served ice cream, which is pretty unique.

A star knocked off because washrooms smelt like puke and was super dirty. Plates weren't always cleaned. Some still had food on it. 

But, this will not deter me from going back cause the food was good and I didn't have an upset stummy after. 

The only buffets comparable to this one in Toronto is dragon pearl and dragon legend!"}
{"text":"After dining last night at my very favourite AYCE Sushi joint last night, I went to Spoonful tonight because of a 40% off special. If you are a big fan of deserts, this is the place for you. The lobster bisque is superb. The rest of the food items were just so so and were surprisingly limited in variety. Unlike my top 3 AYCE restaurants, there is only one item (the soup) that I would want to consume on a weekly basis. It will probably be a long time before I return.

The design of the restaurant is first rate. The men's washroom was superb. I just wish that the food was of the same quality.

The restaurant was not busy tonight (a Monday) as only 1 of the 3 seating sections was in use. I understand that it is very popular with families on Saturday and Sunday. I have to assume that kids love the deserts."}
{"text":"My wife and I just happened to be in Brampton the other night and I remembered that Imperial Buffet had a 'new' restaurant called Spoonful on Hurontario. We have been to 3 other Imperial Buffet Restaurants and frequently went to the Scarborough location as we always got a buy one get one free coupon in our mail. My daughter lives in Ajax, so we also frequented this location. After moving to Etobicoke in 2013, the closest one was at Dixie and Dundas.
I must say that after going to Spoonful, the others do not live up to the quality and ambiance of this restaurant.

The selection and quality of food is excellent and the decor is Top Notch.

If you are ever in Brampton, or just want a little Road Trip. We recommend this place as a pure 10 in the Chinese Buffet business"}
{"text":"I really thought I liked this place the first time I went 2 years ago, but I've been here 2 times already this year and I'm just like, why did I think I liked this place again? 

Don't get me wrong, it's oooookay but nothing to write home about.  BUT, I thought it was time to finally write a review. I forgot to take pictures because I don't really care to take pictures here lol.

I usually start my buffet experience at the salad bar and Spoonful's salad bar is a disappointment. I mean they don't even have pasta salad! What the heck, isn't that standard? So I usually just end up getting some romaine lettuce and the mango salad. I do have to admit they have a wide selection of dressings. I personally like the house herb vinaigrette. 

The only soup I go for is the hot and sour, my fave! I can't complain about Spoonfuls version. Lots of big pieces of tofu. Just the way I like it.

I feel like for the \"main food\" you kinda get everything you want in the first round and by the second round you don't really know what to get. Maybe because I'm picky, maybe because I'm not the greatest person to take to a buffet but that's how I feel. The only thing I usually want to go back for is surprisingly their mash potatoes and chicken wings. The wings are HUGE and it's not all breading. Buuut by the time I'm done my first \"hot food\" plate, I'm stuffed. Hello! I got everything I wanted already! I literally get the same things every time I'm here. Aka I've only been here 3 times.

I do enjoy their different cheesecakes and the cappuccino ice cream. I think their gummy candy bar is weird and gross. There's defs multiple people putting their hands in there. Luckily, I don't like candy and even if I did, I'm not wasting my stomach space on candy!

Anyways, I would never choose to go here. I'm more of a sit down AYCE girl. Aka Spoon and Fork or Sushi and by sushi I mean everything on those menus but the sushi.

It's an easy choice though for special occasions or when you have a large party, so I understand why the place is always poppin."}
{"text":"The best all-you-can-eat place in GTA, compared to other Chinese all-you-can-eat restaurants. It's a bit pricey but the food is actually really good."}
{"text":"Lots of variety but it's all tasteless unfortunately. It is hard to get a hold of staff. As soon as I walked in the greeter warned me that there would be a time limit. This turned me off and was a bad first impression, especially since the dining room was half empty. My visit didn't improve much thereafter."}
{"text":"Spoonful is way better than Mandarin. Anyone who disagrees is a Mandarin employee! :P Seriously though, this place rocks. The food is good all around. Always with any buffet, there are hits and misses. Lamb from the meats section was awesome. Sushi was good for a buffet. Desserts were the BOMB here as the countless pics point out. Skip the mini donuts. Not worth the fat intake/calories. 
PRO TIP: If you are seated before 5:30PM, you can get 10% off if you pay in cash.
Would I come again? If someone took me here and paid then sure HAHA. It's still pricey but all buffets are now a days. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of food but nothing special to separate it from any other popular buffet places like Mandarin or Wok of Fame."}
{"text":"This place is decent, but doesn't exceed expectations. We came here on Mother's Day for lunch, and had a 12:00 PM reservation. It was very, very busy and the waiting area was packed with patrons waiting to be seated. Once we checked in, we were seated within 10 minutes. A server promptly came to greet us, and he immediately informed us that customers ages 55+ received a 20% discount off the lunch price. Good service.

However, the meal itself was a very mediocre. Because there were so many people there on Mother's Day, we spent 15 minutes standing in a food line (each time we headed to the buffet area), waiting to serve ourselves. It was actually a very frustrating experience (which a meal shouldn't be), waiting a very long time to even serve myself some chicken or vegetables. And while the lineups for food were incredibly long, the food itself was bland and seemed haphazardly cooked, rushed and thrown together to support the large number of customers during the lunch hour. 

On the plus side, the decor is beautiful and there's a vast array of choices (especially the dessert selection!). But overall, the food quality and meal experience on Mother's Day was very mediocre, and I'd be very wary of coming here for a meal on special occasions. With tax and tip, our meal came up to around $130 for 4 adults (2 over the age of 55). Lunch patrons were charged the dinner price all day because of Mother's Day."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out Spoonful for a really really really really loooooooong time because I've heard of so many good things about this buffet from friends and this time I finally got to experience its food for Chinese New Year's Eve dinner. Bonus: they offered lobsters for weekend dinner during the month of January.

Environment:
The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous, way better than what I usually expect from a buffet restaurant. Even though there were a lot of people dining for Chinese New Year's Eve dinner, the food serving space was large enough that it didn't feel too crowded at all for the most part, with the exception of the line for the lobster. They section off the area for different kinds of food, there are stations for seafood, sushi/sashimi, salads, soups, rice and noodle, hot food, steaks and cooked seafood, desserts, and fruits. 
For the January lobster special, they had a line for lobsters at the steaks and cooked seafood station. Let me tell you, the line was absolutely crazy!!! I got seated at around 7:20pm and I went straight to the lobster queue and there were around 10 people in front of me and it took around 15 minutes of wait. When I wanted to come back for seconds the line was literally 30 people long, it was insane. So yeah, they were serious about the \"while supplies last\", because every time when they have a new tray of lobsters only about 10 people can get it. 

Food:
So even though there were a lot food and it was virtually impossible to try everything once, a lot of food I found wasn't very good in terms of quality. As much as I appreciate the variety there I was also expecting good quality and tasty food, but unfortunately for the most part I didn't experience that at Spoonful. Most of the items I had were either average at best or just wasn't good at all because it either tasted bad or it didn't taste fresh. Take the sashimi for example, those can't even compare to the sashimi you get at AYCE sushi restaurants, because it was so icy and watery that the sogginess ruined the fish. 
Apparently the only difference between weekend/holiday dinner and regular weekday dinner are the oysters, scallops, and fresh donuts. But with $6 difference, it's absolutely not worth it. The oysters and scallops weren't very flavourful, and again they were soggy and had ice shards. As for the donuts...well trust me you wouldn't want to touch it because there are so many other better desserts available, such as the fresh Belgium and Egg Waffles, various cakes and ice creams. 

Service:
The servers were great. Even though they were really overwhelmed with the large crowd on Chinese New Year Eve, they were really thoughtful and they worked hard to satisfy the requests of of the customers. A+ on the effort. 
There is a social media check in offer where you can get 10% off if you mention eating at the buffet (see picture). They also offer special promo on birthday month (10% off for the table) and on the actual birthday (50% off for birthday person)."}
{"text":"I've been here about 2 times. Each time I am not impressed, but its not a disaster neither. I always see the servers look so bored, or they are laughing and playing jokes on each other. The food is good, not much variety. The quality of the food is good, I have no complaints. I really like their desserts though. I think the desserts are better than mandarin, wok of fame and some other Chinese restaurants/buffets I've been too. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with a high end posh look. If you like seafood, especially raw oyster, clams, mussels, octopus, snails, shrimp, and crab legs; this is definitely a place to go. Also, great selection of sushi, sashimi that actually taste good (not like mandarin). Also, good variety on the hot food station such as lamb skewers, roasted beef, crab, mussels... They also have two station for dessert with a doughnut machine which I really wanted to try but was unfortunately not working on that day. They also have a candy bar, ice cream, chocolate fountain, and a ice tea made with Mighty Leaf tea (I recognized the flavour), which is a high end good quality tea. It's great to see a buffet that cares about quality and taste. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best buffets I've ever eaten in! The seafood was fresh and there was so much seafood selection there - oysters, New Zealand muscles, clams, salmons of all sorts (smoked, sashimi, cooked), lobsters, crabs. It was very impressive. They also had so many meat and dessert options. The teriyaki beef uses grade AAA beef and the way they cooked it, it was so tender and delicious. Their dessert selection is pretty impressive too. Not only did they have a wide selection of ice cream flavours, they also had soft serve ice cream machines on top of that, a donut machine that makes you fresh donuts, and a whole lot of cakes, tarts, cheesecakes, waffles, crepes.. the list goes on. Normally I have low expectations for buffets because, well, it's a buffet but this one just blew my mind for a place in the GTA. Though the buffet is pricey, it's worth the money. Sad I couldn't try every single item - I just don't have a monster appetite to try them all!"}
{"text":"We stopped here to check out Spoonful and wow were we impressed with the presentation and trendy decor!  Never have I seen a buffet so stylish, with such a beautiful selection of desserts.  They even have candy machines and chocolate fountain for the kids!  The food was decent, and service was friendly.  

I would say it's more of a Chinese fusion buffet rather than a HK Chinese buffet like Dragon Legend or Golden Light Buffet.  Parking was plentiful and since it's the same owner as Imperial Buffet there are discounts for birthday and other promotions."}
{"text":"This place is the only buffet style seafood heaven!!!!!They have a variety of crabs (e.g., snow crab) and different types of cooked lobsters / oysters etc. The meat and dessert selection are great as well. I was doubtful about this place because of Yelp review, but I truly think that this is the best buffet in Toronto with unbeatable price. The price was almost the price I paid for one dish in some of the medium price places elsewhere in North America"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this buffet by Imperial. This was my first time coming here. So i can say, i'm not a spoonfull buffet vigin anymore. For anyone reading this, that was pretty lame... 

Anyhoo. I came here to my birthday *yay happy birthday to me =)* and I got 50% off! For all the guests that had came with me they also got additional 15% off. It's a win win situation. Four of the guests that came with me were legible for senior discount, so  they got to pay the senior fee and on top 15%. Mind you that the birthday discounts are only good if you bring CASH. They will not accept credit card if you try to do it on your birthday or someone's birthday, so if anyone is planning on go on their birthday bring cash, and your ID to get that DISCOUNT! I really believe this promo, is very good deal. Also mind that the party limit on amount of people who comes with you on your birthday can be minimum 4 and maximum 10. 

Unfortunately, this promo does not work on Saturdays, which sucks because some people's birthday may land on that day and won't be able to use it. But I suppose it's because on Saturdays they are mad busy on a regular basis so they probably believe they will not be able to accommodate everyone. 

The interior is very modern and very bright. They have I believe 3 large open concept dining areas where all the customers sit and eat.  2 on the sides and one large area in the middle. They also have I think 2 private rooms? I can be wrong. Someone can confirm that if they go. The food there is pretty notch.  From a lot of other people's review this AYCE place is pretty good.  

This place has so much variety in food you simply cannot eat everything. I believe it will take someone two visits to eat everything, unless you have a huge appetite and maybe also perhaps if your fat then maybe ;) 

But yes, there's alot of variety, they got : 

-Sushi (sashimi, maki rolls) 
-Salad bar 
- Custom pad thai and pasta section ( made to order) 
- grilled meat section ( roast beef, chicken, fried chicken, pork and etc) 
- Comfort food section, ( pizza's, macoroni, mac salad, garlic brea, lobster mac n cheese, risotto)  
-Soups ( alot of different choices of soups) 
-Seafood,( crab legs, oysters, mussels, shrimp)
- A huge selection of dessert (donut machine (OMG so amazing), chocolate fountain, ice cream ,crepe, waffles, brownies, cakes, fruits, candy gummies and more) 

Only downside was some grilled meat's they had were very chewy and some was just pure fat.. So that part wasn't so good. They output a lot of meat therefore I can believe they do not have time to cut it carefully before distribution. Figured, it's AYCE. 

I probably missed out on a few things here just because like I mentioned the variety is so large it's hard to eat and try everything the first time you go. The quality of the food is very impressive for a AYCE restaurant. It's indeed above average and I may even say some things are equally as good if you were to go eat a 5 star restaurant. Out of alot of AYCE places, this is probably my most favorable pick. Imperial has been around for a long time and really knows the AYCE game. No offence to some other buffets but Imperial owns that plaza lol. 

I definitely need to go back to try out the other desserts that I wish I had got to try but unfortunately I was too over stuffed that I had to refrain myself from lying down in the car. And yes, when you lie down in the car after AYCE that's the sign that you had too much. And it's the worst feeling after trying to digest all that food. It's seriously a mission =) 

8.5/10 in my books. Really good buffet, food quality is very good, service is good too. Some of the cooks are very friendly as well. If you haven't tried this place before, it's a place definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

This was one of the best AYCE restaurants in the GTA if you're into raw seafood, and even though it's nowhere near my hometown of Markham I would definitely consider visiting this place more often. The restaurant was a bit hard to find if you're not a frequent Brampton visitor, but it's in the extreme north end of Shoppers World. Enter via Charolais and you'll see the restaurant immediately pop up as you find a parking space.

I reserved for 3 for dinner on a Sunday and was given a table about 5 minutes after arriving. There were some families waiting who didn't reserve, so it is highly recommended you reserve beforehand if you're dining on a weekend.

The biggest attraction in this restaurant was, not surprisingly, the raw seafood bar. They have a large supply of raw octopus, oysters, shrimp, and scallops available, and people will go crazy over them including myself! All of them tasted delicious, though the oysters were a little too thin for my liking (still good for AYCE quality).

In terms of the other food, I really enjoyed the sushi bar, in particular the white tuna and octopus sashimi slices, as their quality was very good for an AYCE place. Across from the sushi bar, their clam salad had a nice mixture of clams and sweet sauce. In their soup section, this restaurant has a great lobster bisque, and in my opinion is the only soup you should try as the others were lacklustre. Some other highlights included the prime rib, lobster mac and cheese, pot pies, escargots, sausages, beef tenderloin, skewers...for an AYCE restaurant they certainly have a large amount of variety. Don't bother with the pasta bar as it will severely limit you from trying other foods (unless you have nothing else of interest you want to try). Trust me on this.

Their desserts also have quite a decent variety, such as brownies, cheesecakes, marshmallows, and bite sized cakes. I highly recommend their pineapples as well to finish off your meal, as they're very juicy and it creates a good taste for your buds to end your stay here. I wasn't too impressed with their other fruits, and during my stay did not take anything from the candy bar.

Service was excellent, and the servers explained beforehand about the specials that they have, and will refill your water in good succession. If you dine during your birth month, show your ID, AND pay cash, your whole party will be entitled to a 15% discount. If you dine on your birthday, show your ID, AND pay cash, you (yourself only) are entitled to a 50% discount.

The large variety, reasonable AYCE prices, and the birth month/birthday specials will definitely make me consider coming back here."}
{"text":"Came specifically for the seafood and oysters. Oysters were limited so there's always a line when they serve them (understandably). Not the best seafood but standard for an ayce buffet. 

More desserts than anything (which I was excited about). Had a chocolate fountain but only strawberries and marshmallows for dipping. 

Overall food and decor were good, but not blown way especially for the $28/person price"}
{"text":"I like the ambiance of the restaurant. The food seems to hover around the seafood theme with the exception of the tiny grill area that serves some pork and lamb."}
{"text":"Went there again last night with former colleagues.  The  oyster bar was  good.  Scallops and  oysters were fresh and  juicy.  But the cooked food and the data were not fresh enough for my liking.  Fruit bar and  ice cream selection was  still great."}
{"text":"i have been to many Asian buffet restaurant in greater Toronto area.

this is the best one so far. this is the only i kept coming back till now 
Food is awesome.
Service is very friendly.
Price is fair!
We are going to have a company xmas   party over there"}
{"text":"Ok so where do I start? We arrived at 4:30 pm when the dinner buffet began to be served. Many of the buffet slots about (60%) were empty at the time!! So when we started to eat much of the food was not available. It took them about 30 minutes to fill most of the buffet. When we left some of the slots remained unfilled and it was an hour later! We were still charged full price, however!?

There were also several signs saying \"please limit the amount of food you take so other guests can eat\"!! How bout u get more food since it is an \"all-you-can-eat\" buffet!! How can you call yourself a all-you-can-eat & ask your guests not to eat?!?!  Although they have a good selection (after most everything was full) the quality isn't there..period. You can clearly see that some of the food was recycled from previous buffets. 

I was disappointed & a little grossed out. I won't go back again. In my humble opinion the meal was not worth $125.00 for 3 ppl!"}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5 stars. 

Much better than Mandarin, that's for sure. The decor is aesthetically pleasing. There are many sections including seafood, sushi, candy, desserts etc. They have everything from crab legs to grilled meats, mini doughnuts, and tofu fa. There's something for everyone. 

I suppose like many buffets, the variety is great but the quality suffers. Taste wise it was alright. Some items were a miss like the \"tiramisu\". Service was good."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Always fresh food coming out before it gets empty. Best part is the dessert selections, not just adorable girls but the amount of ice cream and cakes is outstanding."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying love Spoonful. I don't come here often and it's usually with family but we enjoy it every time. The service is good and the staff are friendly. And there are so many choice. For everything. Starters, mains, and my all-time favourite, dessert. Seriously, I could go just to eat dessert. They're seafood bar is great, especially during dinner hours. I was pressed with the choices. I went last evening for my mom's birthday. I missed the oysters and scallops; they looked amazing but the new Zealand mussels I had were delicious. Meaty and tasty. They're lobster bisque is always a must and so good. I skipped the salad bar and went straight for the sushi. Actually, I dove in for the sashimi. Fresh, delicious, and lots of choice (including the sushi rolls. Although I can't comment on the sushi as I didn't have any). I hit the grill section next and honestly, everything I had was good. My favourites were the BBQ pork, lichon, corn, and grilled pineapple. I don't usually have things twice at a buffet but I went back for seconds. Dessert is always the best part of a meal for me and they have just about everything for anyone. I was surprised to see they had churros and man, those things were awesome. Soft yet crunchy but not too sweet. If I had room I would've grabbed all 6 that were sitting there!  They're pecan pie is always good and a must for me because I love the stuff. And they're chocolate fountain is a must. Because chocolate makes everything taste better!!! The mini donuts are also a must and they offer choices on what you can decorate your donut with. Chcoolate sauce, honeu, caramel sauce, powedered surgar, sprinkles. All great choices. I also like the candy section. There are times when this place gets busy and you have to lineup for some things. I have been known to grab a handful of candies to lunch on while I wait. But it's a buffet so don't judge!  What I really like is that Spoonful offers discounts for the person who has a birthday and everyone in the 'party' also gets a discount. So last evening my mom was 50% off, while my bro and I received 10% off our meal. My dad, being a senior, also received a discount. So it was nice evening out. I would definitely recommend giving Spoonful a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I been here before in a group and it was very comfortable. What I liked about the buffet was the wide range of desserts. However, I gave them a 4 star because there wasn't much food options. In addition, I found it a bit difficult to serve myself because they had alot food in pots and ovens that you had to open."}
{"text":"The food experience was 3-3.5 stars. Just the availability of raw and baked oysters, crab legs, proscuitto, smoked salmon, tako and amaebi sashimi were all delights that made the value of the price. 

HOWEVER.

Vaueable items... my first raw oyster was amazing. my second and third were sandy and fishy tasting, so I didn't continue on. Same thing with the baked oyster. very disappointing. The sashimi seemed like they were left at room temp for too long.. they were not very cold in the mouth while eating them. Crab legs were suuuper salty. Proscuitto and smoked salmon were great.

Best tasting items.. there were these wonderful homemade chips in the corner of the room. The chinese ginseng soup tasted very authentic and the lobster bisque was pretty good too. If you can catch the tiny donuts as they are made fresh it is yummy while hot with choco sauce.. otherwise forget it, the oil they use is so old. I can't say any of the other cooked food was that great. I cant recall having to get seconds of anything in particular.

On father's day, they increased the price on their website from $32.99 to $33.99. Not cool. The $32.99 clearly says 'weekends and holidays'.

The reason I had to give a 1 star is because I had food poisoning from this place. From 45mins post dinner until 2am I had violent stomach spasms and pains between trips to the washroom.. the type of shits where you lose electrolytes and get dizzy. Stomach was still gurgly and unpleasant until next day. Another person at our table also got the runs the next day but not as bad as I had it. Will never come back nor recommend to anyone. I am guessing either because the raw stuff was left out too long or the oysters were not cleaned properly. Everything I had here I've had in the past with no issues."}
{"text":"For a buffet, it's one of the best. Although pricey, the quality of the food is generally better than other crappy buffets you go to."}
{"text":"This place has huge selection of seafood. My family went here couple of months ago and every single one of them loved it! Its a little expensive but I dont mind paying every once in while if there's an occassion."}
{"text":"Far away from where I live so I will come whenever I drop by the area. King crab legs doesn't seem often in other buffet restaurant so I think they charge abit more then other buffet restaurant is ok. Lots of choice of food to choose, taste average, will come back for king crab leg again"}
{"text":"Spoonful is pretty much the Mandarin with more emphasis on the seafood.  But if you don't like seafood, like me, you can still find plenty to eat.

What stands out here is they have a lot more selection than the Mandarin.  They do have a lot more to choose from and I don't think I saw an empty tray during my entire visit.  Most of the food looks appealing and they even have sections where the people cook food right behind the counter.  The seats are very comfortable and there's plenty of room to walk around.  As plenty of people have mentioned already, the whole place looks fantastic so A+ there.

Where it starts to fall off is in the food itself.  A lot of the food, to me, was very average.  The broccoli was pretty bland, the wonton soup didn't have any wontons during my entire visit, the white rice was oddly very inconsistent (very fluffy in parts, very hard in others), the teriyaki chicken didn't taste like teriyaki at all and I found the chicken wings had some strange aftertaste to them.  There were some alright parts.  Mashed potatoes were nice and fluffy, the fruit was pretty fresh and my girlfriend loved the candy stations and mini-doughnuts.  They can also make you pasta, though I didn't try it.  My girlfriend had some crab, but she was disappointed that it was all chilled and none hot.  They emphasize their seafood here but since I don't eat seafood, maybe I'm missing out on what good quality food they may or may not have.

Service was pretty standard so no complaints there.  Parking lot's gigantic so I doubt you'll have any issue there either.

Price is okay for a buffet.  It's $33 per adult on Fri-Sundays, with 10% off if you share a picture on Instagram or Facebook per two people.  They have a birthday celebration price of 10% off during the month of your birthday for up to ten people.  There's also 50% off if your birthday is the day of.

With how far the location is and the high-ish price for mediocre food, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"This place is enormous and has a huge selection of food. Chinese, Japanese and North American style. Food is hot and pretty good for such a big cafe. There even is a candy buffet. Fresh made waffles. Oyster bar. The last time I went someone was having their wedding dinner at one of the largest tables."}
{"text":"This is my second time I'm here, first time was for lunch, which was kind of impressive already, and this time is for dinner...and, wow....
Okay, it is not the cheapest...likely to be THE most expensive in the Peel Region, but, probably, one of the best AYCE buffet in all of the GTA (Greater Toronto Area).
It has a VERY go variety of food from Asia done VERY impressively. They look good, taste good, and use good quality ingredients.
If you are planning to eat here, I STRONGLY suggest you come with a VERY empty stomach or you will either feel sorry for not able to try a tiny bit of everything or you will leave with a stomachache....from eating way way way too much...good thing they have plenty of room for you to walk around.
Their front staff is firm (even for reservation, they need at least half of your party to arrive before they will seat you), but very friendly and accommodating. We have two couples who have infants, so we need extra seats and space so she move is to where this was possible.
Their service staff are efficient, attentive, and friendly.
The front cooking staff are not pissed like so many places, as they do greet you with a smile.
I think the whole night the only complains my wife managed to find was (1) while the mussels were VERY fresh, they were not the best quality ones (but acceptable consider it IS an AYCE place and we're not paying $50/person); (2) my mild Pad Thai was too sweet (I think they compensate the sauce with too much ketchup and sugar to make it mild); and (3) their soft served ice-cream was too soft.
Now I get why my parents, and my friend's parents are regulars here. My friend's parents actually \"have a table\" here. I think my wife, her first time here, is impressed enough that I get to come back here."}
{"text":"Came here with my work for our Christmas lunch. Wasn't really impressed. Maybe the dinner tastes better than the lunch? Not too sure. The food wasn't the greatest quality. Tbh I think Mandarin tastes better. Everything was okay. There wasn't one item that I loved. It was always a \"mehh.\" Not worth the money. The lobster bisque tastes like tap water. Not even the slightest taste of seafood. Might as well just go to Mandarin."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated and upscale looking.  I have been here twice, the first time it was quite busy, close to when it first opened.  Second time not busy at all.  First time it was okay.  Second time because there wasn't much customers, the food sat out for awhile so it wasn't very appetizing. 
I liked the fresh raw oysters, scallops and snails."}
{"text":"Got here for my 615pm reservation. It is now 650 pm and I'm still sitting in their front lobby area. Seems very unorganized at the front. Looking inside from the front it seems like there's even a line up for the buffet itself.  #wack"}
{"text":"One of my favourite AYCE restaurants. They have hot food, seafood and sushi. 

If you're craving seafood, this is the place to go!  They have an all you can eat seafood bar. It consists of snow crab legs, octopus, shrimps, whelks/conch and sometimes oysters and scallops. These things are usually not offered at other ayce places. Seafood lovers would get the most out of this place. 

Sashimi and sushi are pretty fresh. There is a pretty good variety. 

They also have customizable pasta. Choose your own pasta, base and topping and the chef freshly cooks it for you. 

As for hot foods, the are similar to the one you can get at mandarin. Chicken, pork, fish, lamb and beef dishes are all available. 

Oh and for dessert, they have two long table full of desserts. They have cakes, cookies, ice cream, crepes, waffles, fruits and even Chinese tong Sui. 

Overall, more pricey than most AYCE places but they offer much more. If you sign up for email notifications they sometimes send you coupons and if you go with a birthday person they give the group a discount."}
{"text":"buffets usually have a bad reputation and this place is no exception!  the wait list was long.  Waited over an hour for a table for 2 which was kind of expected, but the lobby was so crowded I must have gotten trampled by everyone, because no one there cares or has manners.  Once we got into the buffet I walked around and saw that the food was lacking huge!  the food was sub-par and the quality of people at this buffet were nothing but rude or waaaay over dressed for a buffet and wore too much cologne.  They had a fresh seafood section and a lady with gloves on standing in front of a cart full of ice and she was handing out raw oysters and scallops.  I said, when in Rome, and asked for the oysters and scallops.  I took a few steps and noticed a weird smell following me.  I looked around and I was alone...with the raw seafood.  I leaned in to take a whiff of my \"fresh\" seafood and noticed the gut-wrenching smell was coming from the dead oysters and scallops.  So I left the plate on the dessert table and took off to the grill area where the only thing I could stomach was the brisket.  They had sushi that looked questionable and the pink salmon sashimi was taking on a faded orange colour.  The seats were covered in stains, the carpets were layered in dropped food and the servers were incredibly rough with handling all the dishes.  When I was ready to make my escape from this \"hole\" I noticed that they took $80 of my money for 2 people.  Outrageous!  Over priced questionable raw seafood and ok brisket?  I think not!  I can honestly assume that anyone who ate the raw food, must have rushed home to pay the porcelain doctor a visit.  Good luck"}
{"text":"All my friends have been telling me how that spoonful is amazing and asked if I have been there yet and I haven't. So when I was in Mississauga / Brampton area I knew I had to come and try this place. Before going I looked at the decent reviews and told myself \"sure why not\". Once I went in the dining area was really nice. Non of the servers came to greet themselves and I wasn't served drinks until I waited 15 minutes later. I had to stare a waiter down to get his attention. I went to get sushi first which wasn't bad at all for a regular buffet. When it came to the cooked food there wasn't much variety compared to other buffets and the food was way below average. They make a customized pad Thai of your choice but when I asked the employee what's the definition of their standard \"super spicy\" he pulled up a bottle of siracha sauce and told me it depends how much he adds to it. I was grossed out but still gave it a try. All I tasted was loads of ketchup.. It was disgusting. Later on I was excited for dessert because you can't mess up dessert but everything I picked out I couldn't even finish... Even the ice cream was freezer burned. I don't think I'll listen to another recommendation ever again after this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice buffet, probably better than their closest competitor- Wok of Fame. Lot of food counters complimented by fresh to order pasta and pad-Thai. No complaints about dessert section which is as they advertised one of the biggest I have seen in buffet restaurants and pretty good too. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I'm easy going and I've been a server myself to some of the crummiest people and I've seen and heard a lot of things. I just brush them off. However, service/management at Spoonful was abominable. I've never been so PO-ed and embarrassed !  We had a sour taste in our mouth and it wasn't from the food -we didn't eat anything from here! 

So we had already called and warned them we were coming. We come in, wait a little and as we're waiting we see a poster that advertises, ''10% off ADULT price for anyone with birthday month.'' Which translates to anyone born in this month of May would get 10% off. How awesome is that?! Yea, right.

We have two people in our party of ~31 who have birthdays in May but we can only use one. Still. Awesome. We talk to the server and he explains that we can only use that promo if we pay cash. Well, that wasn't in the fine print but no biggie, we Asian, we got this. One cousin starts tallying up the seniors, adults, and children to make it easier for the server to charge us Then later, another server comes back and says we can use both adults' birthday month promo but then I think something got lost in translation because the server wanted us to split checks to be able to use the promo. We are fine with anything they wanted us to do since if it's saves us some money on a $594+ tab, great! But later, another server comes back and says we can't use the promo..? How many servers are assigned to  our section?! 

Then things get really juicy. One of the waiter spills water on a cousin who was sitting at the edge of the table. He just replaces her water and she gets mad. Wet jeans will make for a crummy dining experience. She asks if there will be a discount to compensate for that incident. The server goes to the manager and the manager walks over to the cousin and tells her, 'I don't have to serve you. Get out. Go eat somewhere else. Get out.' We're sitting there, shocked. Another of my cousin goes to talk to her to ask what's wrong and she goes off on him.   Tells him to get out and never come back. She was just plain nasty. 

What irks me the most is that she was the manager and she let her emotions control her. Restaurant is a hospitality field and you don't let your emotions control your behavior. Watching her was like watching an angry wife yell at her husband for bringing his girlfriend home. Just an ugly mess. 

This situation could have been better handled and we are both at fault but in my honest opinion, I feel that if you advertise and tell us we can do something, honor it. In addition, if you spill water on someone, replacing their cup of water isn't sufficient. As a server myself years prior, and my brother who is currently a server we both know the APPROPRIATE ACTION is to apologize and provide some form of compensation! You dense woman. 

I am not resorting to name calling. That is petty. I am merely describing a woman with peas for brain. 

Management is horrible. How that lady got to be in that position, I don't know. Maybe she's the owner, that's cool (sarcasm). Maybe she gets to act that way cause there's a sense of entitlement to being the owner. I don't know. Maybe it's a good think we got kicked out of that restaurant. There are so many maybe's. But one thing is certain, we will never ever return. She doesn't need our money, that's cool. We don't need or would ever want to support her business. Deuces, you horrid person.

TLDR: manager told us to get out and eat elsewhere. 

P.S. your tattooed eyebrows are uneven AF."}
{"text":"I do not get the appeal. There is a lot of different food of different genres. None of it is very good at all. The sushi is borderline awful. Some of the Chinese fare is pretty good, but that's about it. Grilled meats are ok. The whole thing isn't good enough value to make up for the feeding trough quality food.

I have been here with friends a total of three times now, and while it is always as good night, it's not because of the food."}
{"text":"So I came here because I got an e-mail for Friday 30th dinner.  Buy one buffet dinner w/ 2 drinks and the 2nd dinner is free.  I made a mistake and did not properly print the \"coupon\", luckily I still had the e-mail on my phone and the front host accepted that.  No issues.

We were seated promptly... no waiting (was there for 6:15pm)

So there are many items to go through.  From pasta; ravioli's, tortellini's and create your own.  Grilled squids, Steamed Scallops (on shell), baked lobster mix (sorry I did not try this) it was like a tart of some sort.  Stuffed mussels, Asian noodles, fried rice.  Quails, Soba noodles and vast sushi rolls, sashimi's and smoked salmon.  
Salad bar was pretty elaborate and covered a lot of greens.  
Soup options were Lobster bisque, wonton soup, congee to name a few.
Cold seafood included mussels, shrimps, baby squids, sea snails, raw half shell scallops and oysters.  The sea snails, scallops and oysters are served to you... limit is 2 per visit, per person. 
Huge Big dessert section with self serve candies; gummies, wine gums to rotary ice cream; served to you (pretty good choices), self serve ice cream (machine dispense), pies, cakes, fresh donut (donut maker), chocolate fountain, jello and even asian soy bean tofu dessert!

I am sure I am missing stuff as there was too many choices.

I liked that the waiter came to refill our drinks.  He had 2 jugs filled with water or ice tea.  The waitress and waiters cleaning the tables were a bit slow and did not come often.

Overall the food was ok.  A couple of nice surprises but most was at par... not great but not bad."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst service I have ever experienced. First they have the birthday month discount and they wouldnt bother giving our table our discount because we would have to split the checks or so. They also spilt water on my cousin and didnt offer to give us discount for getting her clothes wet and all they did was change the water not even clean the table for us then they stated we dont like the way your behaving please leave"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant just under a month ago.

The atmosphere is very roomy, high ceiling, and the selection of food was just absolutely surprising.

They had fresh oysters, scallops, clams when I visited here.
They have a wide selection of sushi/sashimi.

I did arrive fairly later in the night and didn't get to try all of the food in the time I would've rathered taken. 

I would definately come back to try it again though! 

I LOVE their spinning ice cream fridge. It's so cool!"}
{"text":"***Beware oyster and scallop are very limited.

Very slow refill on both item (30-60 mins), and even worst is they only refill enough to serve 10 -15 customer, if you like seafood go somewhere else.

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"A large group of us went to Spoonful for a company event, 30 altogether. The way they configured the seating was entirely wonky in that we were all sitting at 4 different random tables that were in no way conducive to having conversations, let alone next to each other. I do understand that 30 people is a lot. But we had given them advance notice of over a month, surely a better layout could have been prepped in advance. Either way, it happened. Its done.

The food at Spoonful is no better and no worse than a typical mass buffet situation. It is not unlike Mandarin or Imperial in my mind. Yes, there does seem to be a lot more seafood available for dinner. That doesn't really impress me, I'm not going to lie. Its not that I don't like seafood, but I was disappointed with the basic items that were not up to par at Spoonful.

Additionally, Spoonful seems very dark. Even the food service areas. I'm always wary of a dark restaurant. What are you trying to hide? The service is standard buffet service. Nothing to comment on necessarily.

My coworkers want to go back for lunch one day soon, and I am hesitant..."}
{"text":"The only thing about Spoonful that is better than Mandarin is the decor... 

We were seated really quick, which was good. Service wise I have no idea until this day who our server really was. No one really came over to take our drink orders, we came back with just two glasses of water at our table. Other than that, it was just different servers coming by to grab our plates. 

I honestly dont think Spoonful had that much selection compared to Mandarin either... considering that half their restaurant is dedicated to desserts. I ended up just eating the exact same thing on all three of my trips because there weren't that many options that stood out to me. 

I was excited for their ribs but it was just fat when I started cutting into it. Even got the ribs again during my second run but still ran into the same problem. Crab legs were so soft the tool they provided to help us crack it was pretty useless.  From what I can remember, I also had fried noodles, chicken teriyaki, chicken wings, torpedo shrimp, sausage and sushi. The Maki rolls and sashimi were my favourite! They had a limit of three pieces of sashimi each trip to ensure that other customers can get some too. Everything else I tried was just meh... not extremely bad but definitely not something to brag about. 

I couldn't wait to try the dessert - but again I was left disappointed. The only desserts I enjoyed were the green tea ice cream and fruits. Most of the desserts there seemed like they were purchased from the grocery store lol 

With the few selection, below average quality and non-existent service, I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. I'll just stick to Mandarin, which is only about 5 minutes away from here."}
{"text":"I've honestly been meaning to come here for a while so I was excited wheny work decided to have our Christmas party here. Let me start my saying the decor is very nice, dim lights and intimate seatings. I ordered a piña colda to drinks and it was perfect. I am usually disappointed with my drink and most all you can eat Asian buffets to be honest. The servers were attentive and I didn't feel rushed and they weren't trying to fill us up with water. I was very impressed with the unique selection of dishes at the various stations. Some dishes were a hit and some were a miss but there is more than enough for everyone to find something they like. The sushi was one of the highlights for me, as sushi is never really that good at buffets."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for some time and every person I know has gone to either the Brampton or Mississauga location at least once.  It's rare for me to like a buffet in Canada.  Often you sacrifice quality and variety for fast and cheap... surprisingly Spoonful does exceed some expectations and does better than the average Canadian buffet.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a quiet dinner or a relaxing evening.  Spoonful does have a niche and does it well.

Spoonful Brampton sits at the North East corner of Shopper's World.  This is a blessing as you avoid the crazy long left turns that I see happening from Hurontario northbound.  You can easily go to the back area and it's an easy quick left turn.  It does a large footprint in the back so parking is plentiful.  The interior of Spoonful is a step up from Mandarin.  Instead of a dated Asian bamboo theme, you have a modern look with russet and gold panels and decor accents.  Another good thing they did was have an extra high dining room which helps makes the crammed room feel a bit more roomy.  Thankfully they split the dining area into spots so it's not gigantic room of tables, yelling, and constant movement.

Our table was a large seating of 16 people and we only had one server but wow... was he ever on the ball.  Not only did he manage our table extremely well (never a full plate anywhere), he also managed the next two rows of tables.  I cannot fault the wait staff to handle the constant changes of plates, drink requests, and questions.  That was very well done.

As for the food quality, I found the variety quite decent... not only did you have your regular hot plate area, you had a grill, made to order noodles, sushi, fresh fruit, a great sampling of salads, and a constantly filled chilled seafood area.  On top of this, you had 2 full areas just for desserts!  Comparing this to Mandarin, Spoonful is miles above the competition.  

What makes the experience painful is the people in the line.  I would often be standing in line for 5 minutes and not move forward because the one person in the front is slowly meandering along the line.  After the 2nd time, I notice it's the same 3 people doing this around the room... It's amazing how just 3 of hundreds are causing a complete stop.  I call it user error at a buffet.  I wish there is a solution to this but since it's self serve, there isn't much to do.

So ... the food quality, I would say the chilled crab legs are pretty good.  The shells were a bit soft so the complimentary shell crackers were a bit useless but the meat inside wasn't overcooked the 2nd time around.  I really liked the salad areas as they offered a lot of variety and nothing looked wilted.  The sushi and grilled area was a bit tricker as often it would be empty and the chefs couldn't keep up with the demand but when they had a lull, the offering looked plentiful.  The hot plate area food wasn't bad.  It is definitely a step up above food court mall Chinese food... nothing was over or under seasoned and nothing was over cooked either.  

The most fun was the dessert area... who doesn't like hot fresh donuts or fresh crepes with a scoop of ice cream.  I found the fruit area very good as it offered strawberries and sweet pineapple.  The cake area is a bit to be desired as it looks like it came out of a box in a freezer but who needs cake when you have ice cream!  I like how they scoop it for you quickly.

Overall, this is a great place to bring a fussy and big group as there is a lot of offerings for all taste buds.    Personally, I wouldn't come here because I found the chaos, noise level, and the frustrating experience of waiting 5 minutes at least in each area quite annoying.  Still... very good for it's niche and an a-ok restaurant overall."}
{"text":"Food was good. But cashing out was a bit troublesome. You cannot get any discounts if you pay by credit. You only get their promotional discounts if you pay by CASH. They kept on making us pay with only one bill when we clearly stated that we need 2 SEPARATE bills."}
{"text":"Great place!

Fresh made little donuts (like the tiny tim ones), big chocolate fountain and tons more desserts. 

I like the food selection here better than the Mandarin and other places because of the variety.
No chicken balls here which is great because it's nothing but batter anyway. 

They have a small padthai station that you write what you want on a piece of paper and check of the items you want which is good. 

The Sushi is actually pretty good for a buffet. 
Big selection and tasted fresh. 

Overall great place and I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Service:
- Walked in with a group of 12 at 6pm on a Sunday night. We were told there would be a 20-30 minute wait. We were seated after 45 minutes. Expected with such a large group.
- Our server, Jacky, was great. He was friendly, bright, clear, positive, trilingual (Cantonese, Mandarin, English), and tactfully tolerating of my younger cousins' antics.
- Our busser was emotionless, appeared disgruntled, and quiet.
- Around 8:30pm the table behind us (right in the center of the dining room) started cycling restaurant staff on their dinner breaks. Really tacky. At least have them change out of their uniforms or have a designated seating area for them that is not in the center of the dining room.

Food:
- Variety was good. Wide selection of dishes from different cuisines with a focus on Asian (Chinese, Korean, Japanese) with the addition of Americana, Churrasco, French.
- Most cooked items were as expected, buffed up with fillers and under-seasoned. (i.e. \"Lobster Mac & Cheese\" was more onion and tiny shrimp than actual lobster.)
- Grill items were all quite good, roast beef, kalbi, grilled quail, ribs, pork belly, wings, veggies, etc.
- Salad bar was fresh, no yellowing or wilted lettuces to be seen. Good variety including real spring mix and kale salad.
- Seafood bar was not good. It was constantly raided by those solely there for the unlimited seafood. The clams, mussels, and oysters were tasteless. Crab legs and whelks were okay. Did not try the octopus and shrimp after the aforementioned tasteless items.
- Some items purely provided for the children like pogo sticks and a candy buffet. Yes literally, just candy.
- Good selection of fresh fruit, all under-ripened.
- Desserts covered more square footage of the buffet floor than entree selections.
- Self-serve soft-serve ice cream was spoiled. All three flavours, chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, there were all sour. Tasted like they hadn't cleaned the machines properly in months. The machines also were not the right type to serve soft-serve out of. They were slushy machines thus the soft-serve came out half melted.
- Regular ice cream was also showing signs of improper storage, several of us at the table had the green tea ice cream which tasted salty and the texture was off. This probably means that it was allowed to melt partially then re-frozen in an environment with other foods that were salty.
- Mini donuts looked like they were made of tempura batter, nothing like a classic Tiny Tim cake donut or even a common yeast donut.

Conclusion:
Go to partake in cooked paleo-friendly items. Don't touch the ice cream."}
{"text":"Ive been to all the major buffets in GTA and this is hands down the best buffet. 

The grilled meat is restaurant quality - although the lineup can be long sometimes (max 2 minutes I waited). Ribs are fall of the bone and roast pork is crispy and tender.  Surprised they had peking duck, which had the authentic flavour.
 
My only regret was being too stuffed and not leaving enough room for dessert, easily the largest selection. Their fresh crispy donuts is amazing.

The waitress are quick with refills - as soon as my glass was near empty someone would comeby and fill it without me even asking.

For the people complaining about the limits per round on popular speciality items (EX 2 scallops), you have to understand that its there to avoid some guy taking the whole tray, because believe me it would happen."}
{"text":"Hmmmm, actually I dont like this restaurant too much. I went here w my family and I always have stomachache for each time I ate. Seafood served with cold, not hot and really hard to enjoy them. Not too much choices here and the server was very bAd, very rude. I will not come back here anymore. i prefer to go to work of fame."}
{"text":"It is fancy, but most of it is fluff anyways.  Who needs a buffet with all you can eat candy in nice lit up bowls in the centre of attraction?  There was not enough spread of mains, and large pieces of meat. Mostly small finger foods. The grill items were all pre grilled, hence cold upon eating them. The bbq chef was also re grilling the food as a means to heat it up x2. Bad cooking methodology. 

Sorry not worth the priced. This place is a nice art gallery, to take a few pics, but definitely not a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the food here and they have many amazing selections. I've been here twice and it's my favourite buffet place in Brampton!"}
{"text":"My family and I waited for 20 minutes and when we asked how much longer we had to wait because we made reservations the day before, the Asian girl/hostess with the glasses rudely responded with a \"so what, everyone else here has a reservation as well.\" Major attitude problems and sloppy management."}
{"text":"A BIGGGG step up from when I first visited on 12/20/2013 (Yay to yelp i can track  my experiences) 

From my previous experience I mentioned the seafood was all frozen and defrosted. But heck maybe my opinion made them make a complete 180 turn! 
Loads of variety! Even when the place is run by my people there's tons of other foods to sample. 

MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Best buffet ever. Fresh, neat, well-decorated and yummy. No matter the rotating ice cream bar or the chocolate fondue, or the grilled bar, the food was very fresh"}
{"text":"Been here a few times but less than impressed.  Staff is not friendly.  Set up of buffet tables and food quality isn't great.  Considering the price, I will go to Mandarin from now on.

They take reservations but that doesn't mean anything.  We had reservations for 4 for 7pm on a Saturday night and were not seated until almost 8:30."}
{"text":"Great Dessert and BBQ, bad Sushi."}
{"text":"Seafood lovers buffet. 
They have wide variety of seafood. They have mussels, oysters, crab legs, shrimps, octopus and sashimi. 
I always come here for the crab legs. They are really worth it. 
The service is ok, the waiters come and clear finished plates off the table pretty often."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, and good atmosphere. Although there is a variety of food, it's a little overrated. Some of the options were tasteful while others not so much. If you're looking for a place with a lot of food options to suit different food preferences, this is a good place. Otherwise, if you're looking for some good flavour-filled food there are other all-you-can-eat spots that are better."}
{"text":"Pros: they have raw scallops in shell and oysters
- food stacked very often
- large selection. Nice ambience 
- urinals in separate stalls so creepers be losing

Cons:  
Crowded during peak times. Extremely long line up for hot food 
-freshness of the raw foods. A lil too mushy.  Also, constant sand or hard bits in my scalllop and oyster ( chew slowly)
-location. Whyyyy soo far!  Majority of the population have to travel quite a distance to try the buffet


Came on a Saturday night.  I am impressed. My expectations weren't that high.  But it actually exceeded my expectations.  Selection was good.  Even though I did see the oyster section and scallop section empty for a few minutes here and there I did not sense they were stingeing and holding back the good stuff. Dessert and candy bar was good.  Men's toilet urinals have separate stalls.  

27.99  weekends.  one of the better buffets on toronto for sure."}
{"text":"This is a very good buffet.  The atmosphere is spacious with dinner lighting and the decor is modern.  The food is well prepared, I enjoyed the soups, seafood, and meat selection.  Their appetizer tarts and desserts are plentiful.  I'd say this is a very good buffet.  You'll definitely enjoy more than a Spoonful! :-)"}
{"text":"The ONLY buffet I can support.

Before I go further let me state that: I am NOT a fan of buffets/AYCE places in general. I dislike that it is a given you sacrifice quality for quantity. Why can't you have both?

Spoonful is the only buffet which offers decent food items - in quantity!

There are some misses - but compared to the average buffet (Mandarin, Royal, etc.), there are wayyy more hits than misses!

So, here's the details:

ATMOSPHERE:   Mixed crowd comes here. Good for large parties (I've attended small wedding banquets, birthday & anniversaries parties here), not so good for intimate gatherings. Fun vibe and classier than the *shudder* Mandarin (and with better selection and food).

TONS of parking, as this is attached to Brampton's favourite mall: Shopper's World. Entrance is outside though, so park right at the corner.

SERVICE:   Super fast service. Compared to other buffets, where servers leave you to fend for yourself  - this place has amazing servers who constantly take away empty dish ware, and bring you refills (sometimes before you even ask for it!).


PRICE:   Comparable to other buffet joints. Average.


FOOD:  As mentioned initially, they have much better selection and quality than other AYCEs. Still not as good as a la carte restaurants - but let's not compare apples to oranges.

They have a HUGE dessert section, grill/cooking section, and candy section. Literally makes you feel like a kid in a candy store. Also has more seafood choices than most - although there is a 3 piece per plate limit on the \"bigger ticket items\" like oysters. There has been some hit and misses, but generally their seafood is not bad (for buffet).


In conclusion, this is the only buffet worth going to. But make sure you make reservations. Around special occasions or stat holidays, make sure you book early. And also dine early. Lines can get pretty long at the food stations, if you go on a holiday weekend after 7pm!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Spoonful in a while but my most recent visit this past weekend will ensure that I won't return. I used to come to Spoonful more often because of their wide variety of foods and seafoods, especially the oysters and scallops.

The good thing about Spoonful is that there is a lot of selection. Customize your own pasta or pad thai, sushi station, salad bar, seafood station (oysters, cocktail shrimp, crab legs, mussels), a whole dessert section and more. 

However,  I feel that the food quality has gone down.
Taro Coconut Sago - watered down
Lobster Bisque - surprisingly, this tasted good/proper. I added in bacon bits from the salad bar.
Seaweed Salad - tasted very off
Japchae - was pretty tasteless
Oysters - sandy
Octopus (at the seafood station) - very stiff
Cocktail Shrimp and the Imitation Crabmeat Salad - both were a little too hard and tasted like maybe wasn't completely defrosted
Custom Pad Thai - this was very, very sweet
Scallops (they only had cooked ones that night) - great, buttery taste

The service was good. Our plates were cleared fairly quickly and our server informed us of their current promotion: post a picture on instagram, wechat or fb for 10% off (if you pay in cash)."}
{"text":"Seafood! Seafood! Seafood!
Oh, did I mention... seafood??
I can only comment on the seafood and desserts 'cause that's all I had... oh man, so much variety! And so fresh, this place went beyond my expectations. 
At the raw bar they had crab legs, conch, NZ mussels, PEI mussels, baby octopus and huge shrimp.
They also had a sushi station with about 15 different rolls, sashimi (salmon, white fish and octopus) and Japanese salads.
There were baked mussels and clams, grilled calamari/shrimp/fish, fried calamari/shrimp/fish, lobster tart, lobster mac and cheese, lobster bisque... in summary, seafood!
The food was very tasty, the restaurant is huge, very clean, staff makes sure there's no garbage at the table and your glass of water is always full.
I went on a Wednesday night and by 8pm it got pretty busy, lots of families with small children. I imagine you'd have to wait a while to get seated on a weekend.
Lots of options for desserts! Ice cream station, waffles, crepes, donuts, assorted pastries, pies and cakes.
Just the buffet, no drinks (only water), weekday dinner, and 10% off for birthday month it came to $31.25 per person, taxes and tip included.
Me likey!"}
{"text":"I've been there once for lunch on a weekday and once for dinner on a weekend so I've sampled everything on their menu. 

The food: Some of the items, especially from the grill, were hot and fresh. My only complaint is a lot of the food wasn't fresh. This was especially noticable at lunch, the restaurant was pretty empty and the food had been sitting there for some time. 
The crab legs were great. The lobster pie was made of miniature shrimp and it was awful. Their sushi was impressive, for a Chiense buffet, it was pretty good. The sashimi was good. There was a raw seafood bar, candy bar. The dessert table was big and they made fresh waffles.

The rest: The location isn't the greatest, most of my group travelled far to be there.
The decor is amazing as is the ambience. There's a lot to try and play with. The doughnut machine was excellent."}
{"text":"Great buffet. Lots of selection even for a Monday. For the price of 24.99/adult it's not too bad. 

The service was efficient. Dishes were cleared quickly. Food was replenish well during up till 8 then slowed down as they get ready to close the kitchen at 9.

Some of the dishes were not spectacular but decent for ayce buffet.  However, their grilled selection was pretty awesome and the the roast beef was quite yummy. The lamb was also delicious.

Great atmosphere for groups, could get quite loud at times and the tables were set pretty close to each other so at times a bit awkward. 

Overall, good experience and food for the clan."}
{"text":"It was my mom's birthday so we took her out to Spoonful for dinner and to also check out this buffet out. Since it was her birthday she got 50% off. Adults are $27.99 on a weekend which is pretty expensive when there isn't a huge selection of foods to choose from. I noticed that they have lots of different promotions going on like they have a ladies night where ladies get a discounted price.

The decor of the buffet is very nice for a buffet -- contemporary and chic. The rotating ice cream display is pretty cool. You'll see it when you walk into the buffet area. On to the food, there wasn't a huge selection of foods to choose from compared to Mandarin. It seemed like half of the buffet were desserts. The hot food stations were meh and it seemed like it wasn't replaced often with fresh foods. They also have a sushi station which I didn't really try except the salmon sashimi (which tasted pretty decent for a buffet). There's also a seafood bar which has scallops, oysters, squid, etc, which you typically don't see at many buffets.

Overall, I'd prefer going to Mandarin over Spoonful because there's a larger selection and it's not so salty. Oh btw, Spoonful is related to Imperial Buffet if you didn't know."}
{"text":"Clean modern decor filled with a refreshing atmosphere. 
Great selection of ayce food. 
My favs are the lobster bisque (chunks of lobster).
Selection of fresh baked mini tarts ( lobster, chicken , cheese , mushroom ect 
Sushi assortments
Once again a great selection of food avail

Servers are very attentive and helpful. 
Clean washrooms. 

They have a seniors discount at age 55."}
{"text":"What a scene!!!!
Walked into establishment, asked them right out, do u take Visa? Hostess said yes we do.... sweet, so i took my 5 person family plus one - so 6 person family to this 30$ a head place to have some buffet, didn't run the donut making machine til we were about to leave but whatever, we go to pay and boom, they don't accept prepaid visa's ....... so my 206$ bill is now all on me ...... when I explained that's all I had to the manager she basically said too bad too sad - call someone to pay for you.... when I said that I didn't have anyone in the area as I am from about an hour and 20 minutes away, she threatened to call the cops on me and my husband - wtf? What a train wreck of a place ...... get your crap together - food was pretty yucky too, I'd never go back even without all the issues. **thumbs way down."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my parents. 

Initially, I was impressed with the open space and the decor of the restaurant. The decor of the restaurant is really nice and it was really clean. The food on the other hand, not so much.

The moment I sat down with my plate, the fire alarm went off. Not off to a great start. Apparently it must have been a false alarm as we were not escorted out of the restaurant. We had to sit through about 30 mins of periodic ringing before they stopped it and the wait staff did not offer us any apologies for the inconveniences. 

The wait staff themselves are quite nice and attentive.

The selection of food is great but the actual flavour of the food isn't. I don't expect much from a buffet but the food here was either bland, salty, or seasoned with some seasonings that don't quite work with each other. 

My parents were not satisfied with their food either. They said the food tasted old and to some extent disgusting. 

I myself noticed that some dishes where quite old such as the mini pork dumpling which tasted slimy and unpalatable. I promptly spit that out.
 
I was saddened to see that the doughnut maker is only operational  around 1 o'clock. It would have been much better to have them maybe every 30-45 mins during lunch so that the later patrons get a chance to try it out.

My father noted that the cheesecake seemed to lack the cream cheese taste. I don't know if that's from a cut back or because it's old.

Overall a lot of selection with a lot of weird out of place stuff like a chicken taquito and POGO corndogs and also a good selection of otherwise \"premium\" ingredients such as grapefruit, kiwi, walnuts, and salads such as strawberry kale and \"angus beef\" salad which is more of a grilled ham than angus beef.

While this place is exceptionally clean, the interior decor is nice and the selection of food is vast, it ultimately fails to deliver an acceptable standard on quality and taste of food."}
