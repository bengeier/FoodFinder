{"text":"Been here a couple times so far.  Food and service are excellent.  Coffee is great.  Fast food prices for high quality food.  The only downside is everyone knows how good this place is so there's a 20-30 minute wait time on weekends.  Not that big of a deal considering how good everything is."}
{"text":"The omelet was basically scrambled eggs mixed with whatever fillings and folded in half(which didn't do anything for the taste).  A good breakfast restaurant would know to cook the fillings and place inside the scrambled eggs- delicious! 
Willing to try some other things on the menu but could not rate my breakfast any higher since the coffee was just okay as well. 
Don't understand why a breakfast place wouldn't make sure to have exceptional coffee with exceptional breakfasts."}
{"text":"I was visiting my mother in law in concord last week and she suggested Breakfastime. Now usually when I visit (we live in New Mexico), I beg for Waffle House but decided to try something new. Welllll I'm glad I did! I got the waffle with hash browns, bacon and eggs. Then I saw the grits on the sides portion of the menu. Well as you can imagine, we just don't get good grits out West. We've lived in Charleston, so I've had good grits, bad grits and everywhere in between. Well, I have to rave about Breakfastimes grits. They were just cooked to perfection! They were creamy without that gross coating on your mouth, they were cheesy but not too cheesy, you could still taste the grits. They were perfectly seasoned. The waffle was fluffy on the inside and a little crisp on the out, the bacon was cooked perfectly, but I wish my hash browns were cooked just a bit longer. I like em nice and crispy! The only issue we had was the orange juice. It was not watered down enough. We added more water to the juice and it was perfect. Now if only I could get them to send me the recipe how to make their grits. I only get out to concord once a year! Mama needs her grits!"}
{"text":"Love breakfast here! We hadn't ever come cause of the exterior decor. We assumed it was like an offshoot of Waffle House but once we got inside we were pleasantly surprised that it was more like a cute small town cafe. Pancakes are on point. Sweet tea is good and southern (extra sweet)
Bacon was great and biscuits are amazing. Prices are reasonable also."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. The grits were amazing! We went for breakfast on a Monday and the was no wait. They were out of orange juice but hey, it happens."}
{"text":"Outstanding! My husband and I ate there a few months ago and absolutely loved it!  Would eat there more often!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the Concord/Charlotte area. My wife and I have had breakfast there  three times recently and we had a great experience while there. Even though it was crowded we were seated quickly and our server's were polite and smiled often. The meals were perfectly prepared and our service was quick and responsive. If you want a great breakfast experience Check this place out and you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"The parking lot was almost full but we were seated in about 5 minute.  The dinning room was packed and it was only Wednesday.  The service was quick, the waitress was friendly and very helpful.  We usually go to ihop when in the area but Breakfasttime will be our new breakfast restaurant in Concord, NC.
I like the free 3rd egg on the menu. Breakfast was good, then what can you do to ruin bacon and eggs????"}
{"text":"Tried this for breakfast on the recommendation of a friend who normally is correct on his thoughts on dining.

 Unfortunately, I was not very impressed. Average food, average prices. 

Nothing outstanding in meal to make me want to return soon."}
{"text":"Alysa did a Great job serving us this morning! The food was delicious! If you're on I 85 check it out good breakfast place exit 60!"}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast I have had around here. Big omelettes and large pieces of bread and hash browns. Crispy bacon was on point. Thick and creamy grits. The pancakes are probably the best I have had!  Have also had the lunch and the fried zucchini was amazing! My little cousin got chicken tenders with a fruit cup and it looked awesome. Lots of different fruits! Wish they were open for dinner!! Cailey was a great server and so upbeat and friendly!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has some of the best meals. I had the Curry Chicken Salad sandwich on wheat toast.  It was very filling and it looked great. But, careful for those that have allergies toward nuts. The salad has nuts,  cranberry's in it also. I also had the side item of collard greens.  They are fresh and are not frozen. I received great wait service from Jodie so make sure you request her."}
{"text":"I love going to this place for breakfast or lunch. The food is always on point. They usually always have a wait however, it moves quickly. The service is good and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in town. Great Staff
Good Southern roots.
You must try the Tenderloin Grilled for breakfast. Its the best ive ever had."}
{"text":"The food was horrible.  I've eaten at most breakfast places in the Cabarrus County area.  I've had bland, mediocre food but nothing I couldn't eat.  I could not eat the food we were served."}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the worst French toast and bacon I've ever had.   The only reason this isn't a one star review is due to the excellent service. 

Albeit, my litmus the breakfast gold standard of cracker barrel and if I want even better I go to the iron hen or terrace cafe. So, if you like a fast, cheap meal, sure, enjoy. But I cannot fathom how this place is over 4 stars. It gets the basics right, clean, good service, fast. However, the coffee is terrible, the bacon blah, French toast - forget it. I'm not even blaming the chef, I'm more inclined to believe it is poor investment of subpar ingredients by management. 

My bottom barrel is Waffle House and IHOP. Not insulting these establishments. I feel I have a high bar and these two restaurants are my lowest cut. If you don't make eggs as good as the house or make decent pancakes like the hop then why would I go there?"}
{"text":"This was our first time at the breakfast time restaurant. We usually go to the Cracker Barrel across the street but we decided to try something new. We came on a Sunday morning and the parking lot was full. We only had to wait five minutes be seated. The restaurant is small and has a home like feel. The server Amanda was very nice and we asked for biscuits upon arrival. The biscuits are outstanding! The servings are enormous and the prices are reasonable. Great place to try."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the Copperfield location so I came to this one while they were doing renovations. It's much smaller than the Copperfield location but it's quaint & clean. The food is great & the service is friendly! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I wish I could go everyday! So many options and everything I've tried has been amazing. Strange enough, the best pico de gallo I've ever had. I wish they were open for dinner too, but understand why they aren't."}
{"text":"They have done a nice job with this restaurant. Staff is very friendly and the food is fast, hot & tasty. I had the eggs Benedict, a favorite of mine. I always order extra hollandaise but found out you don't need to here."}
{"text":"Super simple, super yummy comfort food. On this particular visit I ordered eggs and turkey sausage, but the pancakes are good as well, and the biscuits are out of this world. Friendly servers, the place always seems to be busy, even during the week. Definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I went this morning for the first time.  The waitress we had was wonderful!  She knew the menu, she made sure she had our order correct and that we had everything we needed.

The doors was great!  Cooked perfectly, brought to the table hot with everything we ordered.  I ordered eggs over medium, they were perfectly cooked.  Grits were creamy and hot and had great taste.  The meal came with two prices of pork loin which was seas9ned perfect.

I have nothing bad to say about our experience.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Good to have another choice  although I do like Cracker Barrel too. Both places way above the slop they serve at the Parkway House  restaurants on Union Street and  Hwy 29 and the other local  places."}
{"text":"I am hardly ever in Concord during breakfast hours, but the other day I was and was craving a good country breakfast.  Found this place on Yelp, and was not disappointed.  This breakfast-centric restaurant is a real gem.  They do serve lunch also, but breakfast is the star. 

Ambiance is nice.  It's a former Bob Evans location, and it still has the sort of country feel you're used to at one of those.  I was surprised to have a ten minute wait, but a regular there told me that was unusual - normally you get taken right back.  Staff was quite friendly.  

The food was great. I love the \"third egg is always free\" motto on their egg plates, which is what I chose. The grits are fantastic and buttery, but was the only thing I thought they were skimpy on the portion of. I've had better livermush, but they give you two generous slabs, which made up for it. The eggs were perfect.  I have to mention the toast, because at most places, they give you the \"cheap grocery store kind\". Not here. The wheat toast looked more like Pepperidge Farms.  It was great.  

The price was affordable, maybe $1 more than other places, but you get a ton of food, good service, and are surrounded by friendly people. I'll be back."}
{"text":"A very warm and inviting atmosphere. Perfect place to take the family. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. It's busy but they hustle. There is no snail pace. CANDACE was an awesome server. Fantastic customer service. We sat outside and CANDACE tended to us and never forgot to check on us. The fruit platter was tasty and fresh. The food was served fast. The eggs were good The toast was good I would go again."}
{"text":"Had great service and a good breakfast. How do you go wrong with taters eggs biscuit and gravy!"}
{"text":"Great Food! Excellent service. This is a 5 star breakfast place. The owner/chef came out and introduced himself and ask if everything was OK. My new favorite breakfast place. I will go back!"}
{"text":"Oh my, if you leave here hungry it is your own fault. The serving size is fit for a king. I should have shared my order as everything was super large quantities. I've yet to see a biscuit as big as the one at this restaurant and it was light and fluffy too. everything was delicious and hot when it was served to me. the wait staff is efficient and caring and check on you often to make sure you are doing ok. I will be back here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a busy Saturday morning with a table of 7. Waited about 45 minutes, passed the time reading the menu so we were ready when we sat down. Table and counter service was available.   Our server though new did a great job and was very attentive.  We had omelletes, hashbrowns, eggs benedict, choc chip pancakes and waffles. Everything was hot, delicious  and plentiful. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It is a ok place. Cheap price. Not great food... We were served Ham in a veggie omelet."}
{"text":"Short version: Delicious home cooking diner with amazing food, friendly service, and lots of parking. Highly recommend!

Long version: hubby and I popped in for breakfast on a late Saturday morning. We were placed on the waiting list but got seated at the breakfast bar within 5 minutes. 
I ordered the Breakfast Special #4 with over medium eggs, country ham, pancakes and a side of hashbrowns. Hubs ordered an omelette with hashbrowns, toast and a bagel. It took a little while for the food to come out but it was all perfect when it did. My eggs were cooked perfectly. My hubby's omelette was beautifully shaped with a healthy amount of melted cheese (not just an after thought of a sprinkle). 
Unfortunately, one of the patrons sitting next to us was being a real jerk (turning back his whole order because his toast came sliced instead of whole and he refused the whole order because his food would get cold while the toast was being re-made) and treated his server poorly but she handled him very professionally and graciously and apologized to us even though she didn't have to. 
I don't frequent this area as often but I will definitely come back to Breakfast Time if I do."}
{"text":"Great  portions, great prices, great food.
Love eating here, favorote breakfasts 
Will beastly become.your new go to place."}
{"text":"We were running on a tight time frame, never tried breakfasttime before.... It was amazing!!! We will be back! Delicious"}
{"text":"Excellent food good service. Highly recommend!! It's the best breakfast in the area!!!"}
{"text":"A bit smaller than the one on Copperfield but still very good.

Three days ago, I dined at the other Breakfastime in Concord while my wife was driving back from Pittsburgh. She's not a Breakfast fan but when I found out they were so much more that just Breakfast, it opened up new possibilities.

We made a run to Concord Mills to pick up a Christmas present for one of the Grand Kids and I do mean 2018. My wife likes to start early. Also picked up new photo editing Software for one of my computers.

In any case, time for lunch and we came here. This location used to be another restaurant that has been repurposed to a Breakfastime restaurant so it's confined to the space available from the original. In other words, it's smaller that the one on Copperfield.

Got lucky and scored a parking spot right at the front door. Had about a 20 minute  wait but it was a very well managed wait so can't complain.

Seated us in a nice comfortable booth that fortunately was a bit out of the way. I'm on crutches so they get a bit awkward  in high traffic area.

Server was there shortly with menu's and to take our beverage orders. My wife ordered coffee and I ordered half and half tea. Even at that, the half and half was still way too sweet. I hate to think what the regular sweetened tea would taste like.

My wife ordered a bowl of the Soup of the Day which ended up with four choices. She chose the Vegetable. To go with that, she also ordered a side of Fried Okra and a side of Fruit.
 
I had the Country Fried Steak with Sausage Gravy with eggs.  Normally you get two eggs but you can upgrade to three eggs at no charge. For sides, I ordered Hash-browns and Whole Wheat Toast.

My wife's meal was incredible.  The Soup was full and rich and the Fruit was a work of art.

My meal was pretty good but the Hash Browns were premade, probably by a food service company and then just thrown on a flat top. Steak was a bit dry but the Sausage Gravy helped.

Service was good and high marks there.

A previously mentioned, a bit smaller than the other so not as open a feel but I loved the whimsical touch of the wall art. Had a couple of good chuckles out of that."}
{"text":"Tried this based on recommendations from Yelp, and it was spot on!  One of the best breakfasts I have ever had anywhere!

Arrived at 10:00 AM on a Saturday to find the parking lot completely full.  I actually decided to go to Cracker Barrel instead, but made a wrong turn trying to get there and came right back past Breakfastime, so I checked again and found a parking spot.  I'm glad I did!

I had the Healthy Veggie Omelet, and it was delicious; you would never know it was a healthy version.  The fruit cup that came with it was delicious and super fresh...it even had sliced kiwis, which were a surprising addition.

Service was quick and attentive; coffee and OJ were both really good.

I will definitely return, and would recommend everyone try it!"}
{"text":"Grits-CHECK! Livermush for him- CHECK. Friendly service- CHECK. The menu is diverse- something for everyone and has all your southern favorites: 2 types of ham, bacon, sausage, hash, livermush, bologna! biscuits, cornbread, oh my! And if you get a breakfast platter they throw in a 3rd egg for free. Huge portions! Will definitely go back if in the area again!"}
{"text":"Great food and outstanding service.

It's a regional chain in the Piedmont of North Carolina.  Since my wife does not like Breakfast, not normally an option except when she's in Pittsburgh.

Should have taken a closer look at the menu because they offer so much more that Breakfast  and much to my wife's taste.

This was the first Breakfasttime I became aware of. It's on the North End of Concord on Copperfield Blvd just off I-85.

After a stop at Best Buy to pick up an SD Card  so I arrived just after 1pm. The bulk of the rush was over but I still had a 5 - 10 minute wait but no problem.

I was seated shortly thereafter and Robin, my server was there shortly with a menu and to take my order.  I was going to have a regular Breakfast but at the last minute, changed my mind and went with Meatloaf with Tomato Sauce, Fried Okra and Cucumber Salad and a roll.

It's an attractive restaurant much like a Bob Evans or Cracker Barrel in menu concept. Decor is like several restaurants with an emphasis on Breakfast much like places I've dined at in Crystal River, FL or Marietta, GA.

Meal came out shortly and portion size was impressive.

Started with the Fried Okra and it was great.  Great flavor and the texture was perfect.  Meatloaf was good but the apparently they add sugar to the tomato so it was a bit on the sweet side.  The Cucumber Salad was good with good crunch but could have used a bit more vinegar to give it more of a tang.

I rarely mention by name, my server and just comment on the level of service.  I break that policy because my Server was one of the best I have had in a long time.  Being on crutches awaiting surgery, she went out of her way to make me comfortable. Or at least that is the way I initially interpreted it till I noticed that she treated all of her tables that way.

I complimented her and she indicated that she had been only doing this for a month after 10 years in the Corporate World.

Breakfasttme please take note and clone her.  Good servers with good personal skills are hard to find and you're got a great one here.

I also noticed that the next table over was Hispanic and their Server spoke excellent Spanish and the whole  interaction was in Spanish. Great way to make customers feel at home.

Will be back with the wife next time."}
{"text":"Good breakfast at a fair price with fast friendly service. Great way to start the day"}
{"text":"That was real good. Everything fresh and looked as good as it tasted. Decent coffee too and great prices. Tried chicken and waffles, pecan pancakes, omelettes, home fries, biscuits and sausage... All good"}
{"text":"just ok.  my opinion is stick to Shoneys for a great breakfast! The food here is bland and always a long wait on the weekends because of their limited hours."}
{"text":"Would have ranked it 3 stars because it was just \"average\" but your cook served me some of the best sunny side up eggs outside of my house. Bravo! I might be back tomorrow morning based on those eggs alone which earned you an extra star

Everything else was just 3 stars. Tasted like everywhere else. If you like that, I won't judge you :)"}
{"text":"After riding by this establishment many times a week I decided to stop in and give breakfast and shot. What I found was a pleasing Feast palate. Breakfast time is taking a unique approach at only serving breakfast open only from 6 a.m.. Breakfast time is taking a unique approach only serve breakfast open only from 6 am the 3 p_m in the afternoon, and only serving breakfast and lunch.

I had the number two special, which consisted of scrambled egg with cheese, A Biscuit, grits, and a Hefty helping of bacon. The eggs were delightfully made with a healthy complement of American cheese Within. The Grits were second to none, although it they could have provided me with much more and I would not have been angry. The biscuit was hot, light and fluffy, and with a dab of honey inside, melted in your mouth. The only reason they did not get 5 stars is because I felt they could have gave me a more sizable portion of grits or maybe that's just the grits greedy in me.

The service was par excellent, with unbelievably prompt, attentive staff who understand the definition of courtesy. 

BreakfastTime, your have a convert and return customer enroute."}
{"text":"I left brunch this morning generally feeling dissatisfied. I got the avocado BLT with chicken, rice, and lemon soup. The bacon on my sandwich just tasted like salt and the tomato wasn't ripe at all.   BLTs aren't very difficult to make, and so I was surprised that this sandwich was so bland. The soup was ok, it wasn't something that I would order again. My boyfriend got three eggs, hash browns, and sausage links. The hash browns were kind of rubbery and the sausage wasn't breakfast sausage, it tasted like a hot dog. It was overall a dissatisfying meal."}
{"text":"This place is huge! Even though there was a long line our wait was not bad! Your choices for breakfast here are unlimited. There omelette  comes just the way you want. Many other food choices if breakfast is not your thing. Love the antiques all over the place, keeps the eyes busy. Very friendly and quick staff."}
{"text":"Greek omelet was huge, but under seasoned. Hash browns seemed like a precisely cut pre-prepared portion controlled serving.  My wife thought the pancakes were better at Cracker Barrel, but she says that about every breakfast place we go to.

Service was very attentive, no complaints in that regard.

I might try again and order something different."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple weeks ago Saturday morning around 9:30. Not a long wait for us, was longer as we were leaving.

It was all good, not great. Pancakes were cold. 
Server asked us if we wanted powdered sugar on pancakes, so, guess that's the norm there.  Never had it on pancakes before."}
{"text":"I'm in from the Seattle area, but a North Carolinian by birth. We do not have grits, or livermush in the PNW, and I have not known how much it was missed. I love this place! Best breakfast I have had in 20 years!"}
{"text":"My hubby took me out to breakfast. First time here. Great service. Our waitress Donna was awesome. Breakfast was delicious. Loved the coffee which is the most important thing to me! This will be our new breakfast spot. This place beats IHOP...sorry IHOP"}
{"text":"Great food and at a great price. The service varies based on the waitress but otherwise I love coming here and getting a great meal!  

Don't go to iHOP or any other chain for breakfast. Come here. You won't regret it. :)"}
{"text":"We visited Breakfasttime last weekend before our tax appointment in Concord.  We ended up visiting because of the good Yelp reviews.

We arrived at about 10am on Sunday- which we knew could mean a long wait...and it was.  That is why I took one star away.  We were a party of two and waited for about 45-50 minutes.  It was getting pretty extreme at the end and we were worried we were going to miss our tax appointment.  We were quoted a 20-25 minute wait.

Once we were seated we had quick service.  Coffee was quick and they circled around often for refills.  Our food came out fast as well.  We both ordered a combo which I think may have been called Mr. K's or something like that.  There was a variety of different things on this platter and we liked it all.  They have a large menu with plenty to choose from!  

We would return if the wait was not extremely long...not sure when that may be on weekends."}
{"text":"Great food, cute atmosphere, quick in and out diner.  Wished they were open for dinner as well but always where we wanna go for a good breakfast.  Can't wait for them to open the new location in Concord on 29 & 601.  Please hurry, I may never cook again."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE spot breakfast!!! I haven't had anything else but the breakfast but I haven't been disappointed not one time!!! Eggs Benedict is awesome home fries are always hot and pancakes are just the way I like them!!!"}
{"text":"Love Breakfast here it's like stepping into your grandmas kitchen.. !Awesome portion sizes, my fave is there breakfast potatoes!"}
{"text":"For a simple, but good tasting breakfast they do a great job in comparison to others in the area such as Cracker Barrel across the street that I wouldn't give a five star rating. 

It's a great value for the money and the quality is consistent.  They nail getting the eggs, corned beef hash and chocolate chip pancakes just right.  The seating is comfortable and the servers are all attentive and friendly, yet focused.  

There was something consistently deterring me from checking this place out.  Perhaps it was the color of the building and non-homey outside look, but I'm glad that I finally gave them a shot as I'm sure that I'll soon be a regular."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints us. Every time we come we are welcome with big smile. Food it's very tasty and they are yet to get it wrong. I forgot to mention that if you order a two egg breakfast they give you the third one for FREE! come visit you'll love it"}
{"text":"Very cool place, breakfast was great in taste, cooked, and price. Friendly staff and cool decor. Wish there was a breakfast place like this at home in Pinellas Park, FL"}
{"text":"At the recommendation to try this breakfast spot out I tried it. The menu is extensive and I think i'll be back. I got the works Omelet, it was good the service was accommodating and they were prompt.  Another good option for breakfast."}
{"text":"Fabulous breakfast spot for a reasonably priced quick breakfast! I ordered the eggs Benedict and have a gluten intolerance so I requested no English Muffin. No problem! They gave me two slices of Canadian bacon per egg which is very generous. I ate about half and took the rest home for later. They sure don't skip on the hollandaise sauce either! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food and a tad busy on the weekends, but the quality and variety of food more than makes up for any wait time.  I cannot suggest any one dish over another, because they're all so good.  Give them a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Blt is the best! It is truly worth the money due to the amount of bacon! Friendly service and quick! Clean and organized!"}
{"text":"Nice family feel restaurant with plain good cooking.   All of our meals were served hot and exactly as we ordered.  Our table feasted on veggie omelettes, French Toast, Bananas  Foster pancakes- turkey platter and hash browns perfectly toasted toast n good hot coffee!  

The only reason I give it 4 n not 5 stars is they totally underestimated our wait 20 minutes became 40 mins but once we sat down our waiter was attentive efficient and warm!

Portions are generous and prices extremely affordable! 

We will definitely put this in our regular rotation!!!"}
{"text":"So I finally stopped in after being told it was an hr wait for 2 at Cracker Barrel and I am so glad I got to dine here instead! I had the southwest omelette w/ hash browns and it was DELICIOUS! The omelette came with 3 eggs, and for 7 bucks it was unbeatable. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love it. They give so much food I always have leftovers for later. So yummy!! Recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The healthy veggie omelet made with egg whites is delicious and just the right size. Clean, spacious, and reasonably priced. Friendly staff and fast service. Fruit cups have a wide variety of fresh seasonal fruit. Good coffee. My and my family's go-to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday morning and was seated promptly. Ordered 3 eggs up, grits with cheese, country ham, and a biscuit and coffee.

For a Yankee like me, I was in heaven. Everything prepared perfectly!

Highly recommended, and I really like that it is not a chain restaurant - NC already has WAY too many of those.

Enjoy! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food !! Had the bacon and eggs omelette..loved it !! The grits and cheese amazing. All the food was fresh!! I will be back again."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try  Breakfastime . i ordered the combo with pancakes and i added strawberries. two scramble eggs which they gave me a extra egg free , crispy bacon and i order 1 gravy biscuit . My eggs were a little overcooked and i was super disappointed with the frozen type  mushy (not fresh) strawberry. it made  my pancake very soggy and not as fresh.  The gravy biscuit was amazing . i will return again to give it one more try and order something different from there very large menu."}
{"text":"Good as always. I've been to two locations and they did not disappoint. It is worth leaving the free breakfast at your hotel to go and eat here."}
{"text":"Breakfasttime is definitely the best breakfast in the area. The portions are HUGE. When's the last time you went out for breakfast and took home a doggy bag? It's a regular occurrence there. In fact, you can even add a third egg to their breakfast platter for free. A free egg! You can't go wrong with that.

The food is great too. I love the livermush. It's always prefectly browned on all sides. The omelettes are all wonderful too.

Tip: this place gets crowded on weekends. If you don't want to wait, get there before 9:00 am. If you come around 9:15, sometimes the line is already out the door!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about,but the food was average. Being from North Carolina I love liver mush, and this place had ok liver pudding not liver mush. The portions were not very big especially the grits. The frozen biscuits were good, but the gravy was made from a mix or at least if tasted like it. The prices are high for breakfast for what you get. Needless to say I'll stick to the other small hole in the walls for breakfast the next time."}
{"text":"On our drive thru NC we stopped here based on yelpers.  They did not disappoint!  Good, fast breakfast, friendly and good service!  The pancakes were nice & fluffy, we got the extra 3rd egg at no charge, french toast was really good with cinnamon & powdered sugar. Price was very reasonable for a good breakfast!  It looked very busy from the parking lot, but we got seated right away!  We will be back next time thru!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast the livermush was very good everything cooked just perfect! Every time I go almost every weekend the food is great"}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast and lunch.  The food is always fresh and hot.  The food is made from scratch.  

The portions are large so you will leave stuffed or with a doggy bag.  Reasonably priced too.

Service has always been on point. 

Does get crowded but well worth the wait.  

Hours are 6 until 3 everyday."}
{"text":"Finally found a really nice breakfast place in the Concord/Harrisburg area! It seems every other place we try is a greasy spoon. This place has really nice decor, a very welcoming atmosphere, beautiful decorations and colors, and is clean!!! Not to mention that the service was excellent, and the food came out extremely fast. Not sure if this has to do with the fact that it was a Wednesday at lunchtime. Have not been there on a busy weekend. But we will definitely be returning on a regular basis! Oh yeah, and the food was good too!"}
{"text":"Such a good mom and pop place. We usually go on Sundays and the most we have waited is 25 minutes but once you sit down we are usually done within 30 minutes!  Best thing is you can always add an extra egg for free!"}
{"text":"The value of the food is great--and it is usually on point, fast and delicious. You really can't beat the price for the quantity of food you receive. The service on the other hand is hit or miss (out of about a dozen times dining there perhaps two or three experiences were subpar, but our last time truly took the cake and not in a good way).The last time we dined there (and haven't been back since) we had a horrible waitress, she was abrupt, dismissive and never came back to check on us or give us refills until she came back to give us the check. I asked if I could at least have another coffee (a refill) and she came back and poured my cup and was visibly aggravated. The funny thing is my table didn't get service and neither did the table behind us--now the table to our other side did and do you know the odd part? The only table that did get service was an elderly Caucasian couple---now before you start assuming things, I myself am Caucasian. I also am in an interracial relationship and my table and the table behind us who were also not Caucasian did not get any service. I thought this behavior was odd, and we have never had such a horrible server, and especially at this spot. I'm truly thinking she stereotyped us and maybe didn't give us service because she thought we wouldn't tip? Well, as a waitress myself I do tip, very generously I might add. This time however I made sure not to leave anything, and she earned that. We even contacted the establishment and wanted to just make the manager aware and were told three times they were not taking calls and they took our number and nobody ever bothered to call us back--mind you I'm writing this almost three months later. The restaurant owner should care more when it comes to making people of other ethnicities feel unwelcome, especially when you consider how much of their business is made up of people of different backgrounds and ethnicities. I'd love to go back but my partner felt very uncomfortable and will never go back there, I guess if I do go back it will be with friends."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here not impressed the sausage was hot and weird the pancakes were good the eggs were fine the grits were runny the order was incomplete the bill seemed high.I went here again and it was better the food was better the service was great thr decor is still dumb with corrigated metal panels inside weird but the food is improved"}
{"text":"I really liked this place and so does everyone else it's always crowded. The food is great the servers are just as good. Nice interior comfortable only drawback is it's popular and crowded.I like this location better than cabarris ave. Concord that one the food is ok the staff ok interior is Stark not home like servers not as good as the Copperfield Blvd one."}
{"text":"I would tell you the food is very good. And staff is friendly and on there game. This place is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Service pretty good. Food came out cold a few times. Waitress replaced it with hot food. Prices little high for what you get."}
{"text":"I honestly couldn't say enough good things about this place. I couldn't see for anything how someone could give this place anything less then 5 stars!!! The food is awesome their bacon Swiss chix sand is my current favorite but I have them add avocado. Although I've never had anything bad here breakfast and lunch it's all good. It's also a fair price for what you get which is awesome. My wife loves their chix salad sand and their chix and rice soup. Again from food to service I couldn't see why anyone would ever give this place less then 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is great! The breakfast special #2 is the way to go!  It's a huge plate and you can chose your sides to suit you style! Our server was Jessie and he was great!  The coffee was hot and it was not weak! 
Sunday's are a little crowded here but it is worth the wait! If you want to take it to go they have a drive through! Bon appétit..."}
{"text":"I wanted some good down-home breakfast and I didn't feel like cooking it myself so I headed to Breakfastime for a plate of goodness! 

This spot is quickly becoming a favorite! 
The coffee is great (not wimpy and weak), the food is hot and fresh and service is great!

I ordered the Turkey lovers platter; it came with two turkey sausages, two turkey links, two pieces of turkey bacon, egg whites, grits and big buttery biscuits! My slice of Turkey heaven cost less than $8 and worth every penny! 
The wait even on weekends is never really long, but even if I have to wait a few minutes for a table this place is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"First - I was completely unprepared for how delicious the food was here, and the service was outstanding as well.  Every five minutes someone was circling around with hot, fresh coffee for free refills.  
The waitstaff dotes on every customer.  They are superb and patron satisfaction is clearly their primary concern.

The food was prepared quickly and surpassed anything I was expecting.  Everything can happily be customized to provide (dare I proclaim) the best breakfast in North Carolina!  And at a reasonable price.

There are two issues:
The sanitation rating.  At 94, I would have liked to see it higher.  

Also, the wait time was considerable.  It was early Saturday afternoon and we waited about 25 minutes for a table, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is the absolute best around!  

Food, Value and Standouts:
I really like blueberry pancakes, and their blueberry pancakes are the most delicious I have ever had!  

Also, I love the fact that you can get an extra egg [just] for the asking...  Admittedly, I usually forget to ask.  

Disappointingly, my omelette was $8, but rather tasteless.  Speaking of tasteless the biscuits are dry and mealy.  I never take more than a nibble, but like a bold, beacon of redemption...  The bacon is crispy and that is good!  The Arnold Palmers are perfect, and that is great.

Service:
The place is clean, and the staff is friendly, laid back and fun folks.  You won't wait too long for your food.  They hustle to get it for you quickly.  But you typically have to \"ask\" for butter.  

I am so grateful...
That there is a clean alternative for breakfast outside of roach infested IHOP, Dirty, Dangerous Waffle (Awful) House or the bland food central better known as Denny's.

The downside:
Their cost for breakfast is rather inflated, and you better get their before 2:30PM if you'd like to be seated, because they close at 3PM."}
{"text":"This has quickly become our go-to breakfast place. We really like the atmosphere. Restaurant is very clean, staff is friendly and quick. Menu has everything, the food quality is great and portions are bigger than the chain restaurants. Support local!

You will likely wait for a table on weekends; but, as others have said, they move very efficiently."}
{"text":"Located in a former Bob Evans, this spot right off the Interstate is perfect for breakfast. It's clean, it's comfortable and on a weekday, it was surprisingly busy. I was brought to a table immediately by a pleasant hostess and my waitress took my coffee order. When she returned with the mug, I placed my breakfast order.

Not long after, a very large platter arrived looking mostly empty as it only had the two eggs benedict and a good portion of hash browns. Unusual plating, really. But after I got past that and dug into this breakfast, it was fine. A good portion with the eggs perfectly cooked, the ham underneath was excellent though the muffin was just a tad underdone. A very minor complaint. The hash browns were perfectly cooked though a little greasy.

All told, an excellent breakfast. I am so glad that I chose Breakfasttime instead of the Barrel folks across the way!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! Super fast service,  food was great.  Prices reasonable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times were great!  Definitely good food and great service. 
The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. It is very busy on the weekends, but I got a table within a reasonable amount of time.  The wait isn't bad at all.  
The service is friendly and the atmosphere isn't too loud. They have bar seating much like an old fashioned diner with plenty of booths and tables to any size crowd.  
Great location off the interstate to meet people as well.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Easily best breakfast in Kannapolis and Concord. The wait is a little ridiculous. However, this is a sign of a great restaurant. Everything I have had here has been phenomenal and very generous with portion sizes. Highly recommend the omelettes and the country fried steak."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful breakfast here and the prices are excellent! Unexpected! Worth it! Everything was cooked perfectly."}
