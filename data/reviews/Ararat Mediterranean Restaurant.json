{"text":"I can't believe this place shut down.  It was our favorite Greek restuarant.  Ugh, I am so bummed!  The staff was friendly, the food was AWESOME and we were never disappointed.  We'd been going there for a few years and then one day, poof!  Come back Ararat's!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is right next to the Gateway Crossing Harkins Movie Theatre, so Hubby and I decided to check it out. The interior is small, impeccably clean, and very modern, with a number of custom made pieces of art and metal sculpture. Service was immediate and very attentive, almost to the point where I felt a little watched. We had hummus, which was tasty at first, but the garlickiness became overwhelming after a while. The pita was warm and plentiful. We both had a chicken meatball soup which we agreed was a little strange, but tasty. Hubby decided to try the mexi-gyros which was the standard gyros sandwich but loaded with bell peppers, onions, and jalapenos. He said it was the hottest thing he's ever eaten in Phoenix and is right now crashed on the bed moaning a little. No need to say more. I had the beef kabob, which was a little on the chewy side, but not overdone as far as the cooking process goes. It was too overdone on the marinade spices, for my taste however. The truly outstanding part of the meal was the heaping serving of jasmine rice- flavorful and perfectly done."}
{"text":"We have been eating at this place for 2 years...  LOVE IT!  My husband and I always order our usual: Chicken Kebabs with rice Gyros Pita Platter with fries  The best soup of the day is the chicken meatball.   YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to the area, and I was really excited when I realized there was a locally owned Mediterranean restaurant in short driving distance from my house!   I went with two friends and we first ordered the hummus.  It wasn't the best hummus I have ever had (but then again, I'm from Michigan, where good hummus is quite easy to find).  They served it with warm pita triangles, but in no way was it enough to finish the hummus.  We ordered more for an extra fee, which seemed to peeve my fellow diners off.   I ordered the chicken kabob entree, and it was quite good.  The rice is amazing, and the chicken is well seasoned.  It is fairly plain in the scheme of things, with no added veggies.   My counterparts got the lamb kabob and the the dinner size classic Greek salad.  I was told the lamb kabob was tasty, and the salad was good although it was nothing special. I've ordered take out of the chicken kabob a few times, and am always satisfied.  It is a large portion and a great way to get away from the chain options are are rampant in the West Valley. The service was good, but since it is usually slow here, it seems like they are in your face quite a bit.  The cook is the owner, which is pretty cool in my book. If you are looking for something different and tasty, I would try out Ararat.  Although simple, it is quite delicious."}
{"text":"Four of us went here today for the first time. The service was wonderful and the food was great!!! We all had different items and we all enjoyed ourselves. Portions large and salads fresh. We all agreed that it was some of the best Mediterranean food we have had. We will return!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite middle eastern restaurants.  The staff is always friendly and attentive.  I love the lentil soup, falafel pita sandwich, hummus and baklava!  The rice is so fluffy and light.  I will continue to eat here and bring all my friends who come to this side of town."}
