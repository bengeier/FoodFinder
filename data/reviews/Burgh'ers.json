{"text":"The Fox Chapel Burger is the best burger I've ever had. Every time I'm here I want to get something different, but I just can't. The size of the burger is perfect, you can actually take a bite! Cheese fries are also getting a reputation in Lawrenceville because so many of us are addicted to them. The space is nice, service is quick and friendly. They also have a changing table in the men's & women's rooms which is great for all the families in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last night with our two year old daughter. Everything we tried was fabulous and our server Kelly was awesome! The meat blend for the burgers was the best we have ever tasted. My husband order The Liberty, but also added bacon. The ability to build your own burger or customize any of the existing sandwiches was a big plus. I had the pickle brined fried chicken sandwich - let me just say OMG - so tasty!! My daughter had the mac-in-cheese (we helped her finish it) and it was the cheesiest. We started with the everything bagel hot dogs and while they weren't exactly what we expected - they had great flavor and I would highly recommend you give them a try. Great beer menu as well - Monkey Boy paired well with our meal. LV needed a great burger spot and this place definitely fits the bill!!"}
{"text":"Not great. I wanted to like this place. Atmosphere is good. Wait staff was friendly. 

Appetizers - had the fried chicken and perogies. Fried chicken was off. The breading was fallling off, very thick, and full of cornmeal. The taste was good (pickle brined). Perogies were hard and fried; not good.

Burgers - Why are the burger patties so thin and the buns so thick? 

Fries are the best thing they have going. 

Service was slow, was over an hour to get our burgers. 

Currently BYOB."}
{"text":"Found this burger place while searching for a late afternoon bite. The burger was quality and the fries were nice & crispy. Waitress was really pleasant and personable. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger!!! Not a bad deal either. Staff is really friendly and the fries are crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Staff was nice, facility looked brand new and super clean. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The burgers are better than BRGR or Burgatory and they have a better attitude for the same price. I had the Polish burger (with a pierogie).  Fries are thin and well-salted, not greasy or soggy.  It's clean, fresh, and friendly.  I like the mix of all floral plates and miscellaneous pint glasses.  The hostess and server were helpful.  I used a Groupon, but would go back and pay full price any time."}
{"text":"Perfect burger establishment. What an amazing restaurant   from all the local beers ingredients and decor....everyone needs to experience this piece of pittsburgh heaven. Can't speak enough about the delicious burgers and chicken sandwiches"}
{"text":"The Maggie's Farm burger is amazing...now know why it is so popular! Rosemary fries are perfectly done and very tasty! Great variety and a very eclectic offering.  Coming back to try more!!"}
{"text":"I had Maggie's Farm burger, it was excellent. Meat was fresh & delicious, gluten-free bun was surprisingly good. Decor is retro casual. Very pleased with 1st visit."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place but had a disappointing outcome unfortunately. 

We ordered chocolate and mocha shakes which were yummy. Plus the goat cheese balls were delicious. My husband also liked the pickle brined fried chicken sandwich.But the rest was just eh. 

I ordered the Liberty burger at medium but it was well done. If you're going to be a burger joint then how can you get that wrong? The secret sauce on it was so bland and I was so excited to try it!  My friend ordered a custom burger and they forgot his sauce. Another friend ordered a sandwhich and it didn't come out as how ordered either. I don't know if they are still just getting used to things including their ordering app but hopefully they get it together.

The burgers are small for the price. Our bill was about $50 incl. tip for two and that didn't even include alcohol!  I don't see us going back."}
{"text":"Service was completely disinterested and negligent.  I'm a bartender.  We've fired people for this level of negligence.  How do you expect to survive long term with better places around you if you can't at least look like a pro with the quality of service?  Due to the lack of service for what was a notable length of time, I got up and walked out.  I did not get a chance to even critique the beers and frankly, I'm already not interested as a result.  I walked down to Cinderlands and had a very good all around experience there.  Burgh'er could've had my money and a potential of spreading positive word, but they dropped the ball."}
{"text":"I came to Burghers on a Saturday around 2:45 not realizing they did not open until 4. A guy whom I assuming is the owner insisted that I stay and be served so I took a seat at the bar. I ordered the Polish Hill which is a burger with cheese, caramelized onions, and pierogies. It was cooked to a perfect medium and tasted great. Unfortunately they don't have their liquor license yet but the bartender, Randolf, was nice enough to offer me one of the beers that had been given to them from a rep free of charge. Free beer is always the way to my heart! I will definitely be returning and telling friends!"}
{"text":"Okay..yinz..I love the name of this restaurant.. so clever !!  This chic loves burgers.. so excited to try this new hot spot!  Décor is industrial and a bit noisy - like cafeteria noisy.  The crowd.. Families.. Children etc.   I was immediately drawn to the bar (back rear) because of the beautiful wood top and cool stools.  I arrived early and had to wait for my friend and was immediately waited on.   They didn't have any booze yet but still was happy chilling at the bar.  I felt as if it might have been too noisy sitting at table and the bar was actually off to the side.   The menu is very interesting features and short and sweet..  nothing to study here.. I like that - short and sweet!   Unique names each burger selection that any Pittsburgher/yinzer would appreciate.    There is an option to build your own burger, but I had to go with the \"Pitts-burger\" - cheddar, slaw, pickles, basil, onion and special sauce.   Other interesting burger creations include \"Mexican War\" \"Forest Hills\" and \"Lawrenceville\" to name a few.  Prices were no doubt above average.  After placing our order, our food seemed to take quite a bit of time - 20-25 minutes for our food to arrive.  It could have been just be growing pains of a new restaurant.  The Pitts-burger was delicious and worth the wait and my side was the rosemary fries.  The fries were very flavorful - of course but after a few fries I had wished I had ordered regular fries instead, since the rosemary type blend (oil) was a little heavy for me and the portion was quite plentiful.  No shortage there on fries.  We arrived at 6PM and by 7PM the restaurant was packed.  If you love Pittsburgh and burgers, definitely check it out.   It was a unique experience .. Thanks Burg'ers!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in Pittsburgh. We went on a Monday when the special is sliders. We sampled six different burgers. Each was better than the last!"}
{"text":"This past Friday, 05/05, went to Burgh'ers for an early dinner.  My first impression of the site was bright, contemporary, well thought out!  Hostess and waitstaff were great...friendly, smiling and through chatting were happy to be working there.  Since the tavern license hadn't started yet, we were treated to free Straub draughts.  The menu was, in my opinion, their starting off point.  Besides wild game, beef and chicken, I would like to see maybe a salmon burgher or an open face entree.
I opted to build my own burger with potato bun, cheddar, carmelized onions and sauteed mushrooms.  The bun  was great.  I am so sick of those \"brioche\" buns falling apart under the weight of great stuffins.  My burger was prepared to order and came out perfectly.  Now...the fries.  I have lived long enough to have gone through many many incantations of the french fry.  Curly, spicey, puffy bubbled crispy version, etc.  What I got at Burgh'ers was honest to goodness fries which actually tasted like potatoes, crispy, hot and plentiful.  Anyone who knows me always can depend on eating fries from my plate when I am done with my meal.  In this case...fork and knife were up in defense of my fries.  The first time in almost 20 years that I cleaned my plate.
The restaurant is new, attractive, friendly staff, great food.  You will be doing yourself a favor to try Burgh'ers."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here after purchasing a groupon. For being a burger place I expected a little more flavor to my burger but it was very average overall. We both did make your own burgers and didn't realize until our food arrived now small the parties were. It was about the same size as a five guys \"little burger\" but at a higher end burger place price. The fries were pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. 

Our waitress was good and the overall decor was a modern/industrial feel. However, I don't think the food was good enough to get me back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just opened with nice atmosphere.  Staff is very friendly.  Burgers were OK and pricey for the quality.  Don't think I would go back"}
{"text":"Best Burger in town, surpassing BRGR.  Great fries, condiments, atmosphere.  Touch pricey but with their new build in Lawrenceville, it is what it is.  Great service as well.  Great creativity on the burger creations.  They even have a vegan burger for all those hippies who live in Lawrenceville that regret being vegan and need a good burger tasting fill!"}
{"text":"Saturday night. Table for 2. We walked in a little before 8 PM and saw only 4 tables seated (2 of which were larger parties). Despite that, the noise level was insane. I had to shout at my friend and the waiter had to crouch down to hear me. The decor looks like they tried so hard to be cool but it just looks like everything else out there. Or worse - something staged at Target. 

Our waiter was awkward in his interactions and came off a little unsure. As someone in the service industry, you should know what an Arnold Palmer is. I ordered the Bloomfield and my friend ordered the Fox Chapel (both medium well). It took close to 40 minutes to get our burgers. His fries looked like they were sitting out for a few days and so did my mac n cheese, but to our surprise, both were tasty. Still, you eat with your eyes, ya know? 

The thing that got me was the fact that they tout F2T, but they drown these burgers in toppings. I couldn't taste the meat at all through the sauteed greens and my friend's burger had so much goat cheese that the meat took a backseat to that flavor. I understand wanting to dress up a burger, but shouldn't farm to table meat be the one stealing the show?"}
{"text":"Really excited to discover this new place in Lawrenceville that seriously rivals BRGR and Burgatory.  Excellent farm-to-restaurant freshly ground burgers, locally sourced everything.  Everyone was friendly, food was delicious!  Definitely will return soon!"}
{"text":"Lunch today was great.  Cool vibe.  My companion had the pesto chicken sandwich and LOVED IT.   Cream cheese on the sandwich was just crazy good.  A Philly caprese sandwich.   Other friend has the Bloomfield burger.  Said the meat was really good.   I had the Veggie burger - vegan and gluten free. (Often this stuff is good for you but bland).  But this had a fresh pickled onion and mojo sauce that really pulled it together -- so great place."}
{"text":"I am happy to see this place open in Lawrenceville and I am happy to see their focus on local farm meat and produce. This is reason enough to try to support this new restaurant. But, that said, I believe they need to ask and listen to feedback in order to grow and sustain themselves in Lawrenceville. The place is great looking and the concept good, but the burger is not even close to other burgers in Pittsburgh. The buns were dry (worst potato bun ever... you need brioche) and the cheddar cheese was not melted (also seemed to be a pre-sliced cheese, not sliced in house). Also, the patty was thin (although well-seasoned) and I ordered medium but it was well done; not even a memory of pink. There is no excuse for this if you are trying to be a burger place when there are so many other good burgers close by. Burgers at Butcher and the Rye, Meat and Potatoes, The Vandal, Tender, Ace Hotel, the old burger at Salt... these all FAR surpass this burger. They are going to need to bump up their game in order to compete in burgers in the city. But, if this place is trying only to compete with BRGR or Burgatory or appeal to families who visit from the suburbs, well they might be fine. But, as a local Lawrenceville foodie, I likely will return once more in a few months to give another try after they have had time to grow. My advice is that they give people comment cards to fill out and have people list their zip codes and other places where they like burgers and then listen to the feedback. If this restaurant listens to Lawrenceville guests and grows inside the context of this new location, they could end up being a good place for the neighborhood. But, they have a big learning curve ahead."}
{"text":"We work in the same block and decided to try it. We had heard it was pricey and it was. The burgers were small compared to Tsaros up the street in Bloomfield!and $2.00 more. I bought lunch for two and with tip it was $40.00. I had a soft drink which came in a can and was charged $3.00. Cmon have a fountain refill for $2.00. We probably won't go back and have past the word thru out the office. The only good thing I could say is the service was okay!"}
{"text":"Solid burger...Solid staff...soft fries.

It was still new when I went. Atmosphere is little cold and suburban shopping plaza'ish.

Buuuut I have to say, best burger in Lawrenceville...so far."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a very approachable feel. Nice alternative to other places in Lawrenceville. Decor is well done and atmosphere is very casual.  

Good burgers and food was fairly priced. 

No complaints about service.
 
I would return."}
{"text":"Great Burghers! Party of 6 last Saturday waited about 5 min. Food was fresh and delicious. I had the Polish Hill !! The menu is to the point, nice mix. For the time being it's BYOB, which is awesome. THINK Arsenal Cider House 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars. The burgers are delicious, the rosemary fries are great! It's surprising rosemary fries aren't served in more restaurants. The quality of the ingredients is apparent. The drink prices are surprisingly below market value. The location and large windows are perfect for a Lawrenceville eatery. The only drawback were slightly cloudy and water spotted water glasses."}
{"text":"I just left & oh my gawd THE best burger (sorry Five Guys) I've ever had!!!!!! I'm new to the area and wanted to escape my Airbnb & came across this gem thanks to YELP! I built my own burger & chose slaw as my side. A bit expensive, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Had an awesome lunch and a great beer. Fox Chapel Burger was great. Rosemary fries were over the top. Had a GF celiac in our group and our waiter and the menu made her feel confident in the meal. Will return next week time we are in town. Go there"}
{"text":"My boyfriend suggested checking out Burgh'ers as something new before heading to Row House Cinema and I was pleasantly surprised! As another reviewer stated, they have delicious local and organic burgers, many named after Pittsburgh's neighborhoods, milkshakes crafted from Millie's ice cream (that are absolutely to die for) and much more. 

We arrived hungry and shared a Mexican War and Morningside. Both burgers were outstanding, yet the Morningside particularly was over salted and perhaps could use a hint of something sweet to offset the salt within the patty, bacon and egg. The Mexican War was my favorite as all of the flavors melted in your mouth and had the right amount of spice after each bite. The rosemary and regular fries were also tasty but again suffered from too much salt.

We left pleasantly full and it's safe to say this is my favorite burger eatery in Pittsburgh by far! Simple, fresh and not-overstated decor meets great food with speedy and attentive service. We will definitely return and try something new--hopefully the beer too!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the burger quality for both myself and my husband. Burgatory, BRGR and even Five Guys offer better made burger.
I got the chicken burger, which was very dry. It's understandable that chicken can get dry, but usually with good toppings and sauce this can be covered up. But my burger was dry and the toppings were not enough to balance out the dryness. In addition, it was on the saltier side. However, compare to my husband's overly salted burger, it was not so bad. My husband got the Mexican topping burger. Although the topping and cheese was good, but then burger was sadly over cooked (medium turned into well done). The salt level on his burger was also twice as salty as mine. 
Although the service was nice and the place was clean, I am giving it an extra star. But sadly, we will not be going back anytime soon....unless they make some major changes.
The price we paid was definitely for gourmet burgers but the quality was not there."}
{"text":"The few lists that are out there with the title \"great new places to eat in Pittsburgh\" weren't lying! Hubby, son & I had each gotten make your own burgers with the cheese fries as side & a chocolate milkshake. The shake was delicious, a little in the higher priced side but the shakes taste made the $7 well worth it. The burghers were cooked perfectly. Do not be deterred by how the cheese fries looked, the sauce looked bland & runny but was a little bit spicy & delicious. If there was one thing I had to say that was out of the norm it was the antique plates they serve the food on, in a more modern restaurant I found that odd. I will say that if the plates are the only thing I can complain about though, Burghers is a go!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers and decent vegetarian burgers.  Not oversized like some places so it is manageable in one hand.  Place was relatively empty but loud.  Would think it would be an issue when the house is packed full."}
{"text":"This place is great! The burgers were juicy and perfectly cooked, the French fries were awesome, and the fried chicken was some of the best I've ever had! I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Burgh'ers is great if you want to get a burger and fries and that's about it. Although the burgers and fries are really good they are extremely overpriced. Last time I went there I wanted a burger with the game meat on it and it was a $9 up charge on an already $11 dollar burger! Overall a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"\"One more burger joint\"  Oh yes, \"ONE MORE BURGER JOINT\".  This place is the real deal.  I went early on a Thursday evening and no one, yes no one was in the place.  I wonder if the secret isn't out yet that the burgers are great.  When I say great, I mean that they were cooked to the actual temperature ordered.  I ordered Medium Rare and yes, my burger was bleeding.  My BF ordered Medium and again it was perfectly to temperature.  A little pricey, but menu is pretty diverse with a burger for all tastes."}
{"text":"Service is awesome and fast! Food is delicious, I got the Forest Hills since it's where my parents live (ha!) and I was hardly disappointed. I've never had honey on my burger before but it was completely done correctly. The side salad of mixed greens was also fresh and tasty. My friend had the pickle chicken and that blew my mind as well, unbelievably good. Never had it before then. Report of my friend is that the house beer was pretty good and the stout she tried (there are many) was surprisingly tasty. Definitely seems like an amazing place for a good beer just from looking around. The biggest downside of this place is the volume, literally it's hard to hear yourself think, so this really isn't a good spot for a date or even really catching up with friends butttt if you want a stiff drink with a novel \"burgers by neighborhood\" theme in a fun space with friendly and attentive staff, then this place is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've had in Pgh. The fries were also perfect. A little disappointed with the chocolate shake. The service was fantastic and the restaurant is very comfortable."}
{"text":"Um hello delicious, fresh burgers! I've always been curious about this spot and decided to stop in for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. The place was totally deserted which I find crazy now knowing how good their food is. Pro-tip: go on a Tuesday afternoon! You'll get your food super quick and it's a super relaxed atmosphere. 

Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and explained that their most popular burgers are all named after neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. They have two sizes of burgers: a craft ($13, regular sized burger) and a mini craft ($10, a little larger than a slider). All burgers come with a side of fries or mixed greens and you can upgrade for $1 for rosemary fries (THE BEST) or $3 for pierogies, mac and cheese, or slaw. 

I opted for the Fox Chapel craft burger, which did not disappoint. The patty is their #theblend, which is half local grass fed beef and half sautéed mushrooms. If you like mushrooms, go for #theblend, flavorful but not overpowering. The burger was topped with goat cheese, mixed greens, pickled onion, avocado, and a balsamic reduction. It seems like all their burgers are served on a potato bun, which I didn't love, but it was still tasty. 

Now, let's talk about the rosemary fries. These are totally, without a doubt, worth the $1 upgrade. My mom hates French fries but could not get enough of these. Their fries are hand cut, too, which is a score in my book. 

Overall, I think this may be my new favorite craft burger spot in the burgh. Love that all their ingredients are fresh, and most even locally sourced. Aka you'll won't feel gross after eating their food. I didn't have a brew, but they have a huge craft beer selection, too. 

If you're not in the mood for a heavy, in your face Burgatory burger, definitely hop over to Lawrenceville to Burgh'ers."}
{"text":"Not a great experience.
I really wanted to like this place. Instagram photos were amazing. I was so excited for a great burger. I was very underwhelmed. My burger was just so so.  It seemed to lack proper seasoning. I ordered cheese fries and they weren't really hot and were just covered in cheese goo. My wife got the pickle brined fried chicken sandwich and the breading just kinda fell off. The bill came to $16 for a burger and fries. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Service: it was definitely not the best experience we had a a restaurant. We went in on a Friday night at 7( I remembers because I happen to have a reminder set up on my phone for 7pm) ordered almost right way. Didn't get our food at 8pm. We looked around, there are some tables, sure, it's Friday but the place was not that packed. I would say 1/3 of the table was empty. So glad we ordered two appetizer, and they came out in a fair amount of time. But our waiter kept apologizing but still can't keep up. Didn't refill our drink for a long time, take him a while to get a beer from the bar etc. two words for the service,  sincere but too slow!

Taste: appetizers were ok, we had the fried chicken and fried goat cheese ball. Fried chicken was too salty for my taste but the rest of the friend liked it. We all think the goat cheese were just ok, average. But burgers were great! I forgot which one did I get, but we had 4 different kinds and every one of them were excellent!"}
{"text":"Decent burger place that opened in the Lawrenceville area. Apparently this place is well known in the North Hills area and they decided to open a location in the city. Great timing as I was coming off work & decided to drop by to try their wares. Ended up taking a Maggie's Farm (smoked gouda, horseradish, caramelized onions, roasted chilies, rum aioli, plus patty [medium rare, I chose]) and a half side of rosemary fries to go. As for the fries, they were decent though I found the rosemary a bit overpowering to my taste buds. Would recommend they go a little lighter with the use of such seasoning in general. As for the burger itself? Pretty good overall. I wouldn't place the patty quality as good as that of BRGR or Burgatory as it was also rather lacking in flavor/juice, but I'd probably consider such passable and better than fast food burger patties (a slight step up). It's nice that they have a build-your-own option though that's probably more expensive, sandwiches, shakes, sodas, salads, other sides, and more so that's a plus for food variety. Will have to try other things and update accordingly. Overall though, would recommend other places to go for better tasting burgers."}
{"text":"Not sure we need another burger joint, but this one is very good. Tessaro's is my gold standard for hamburgers, but they do okay here.

The service was very prompt and the decor is very pleasant.

For now this place is BYOB, bit it looks like they will add the craft beer very soon."}
{"text":"I would totally come here again....can't go wrong with a classic burger joint that puts their own twist on things. Atmosphere is nice. It's clean, open, and has an industrial feel with the exposed beams. Only complaints I would have is that the server wasn't very personable, more of a \"what do you want\" as soon as you sit down type of person...and the music was a bit loud."}
{"text":"This just opened and it's a hip cool burgher joint on the main street in artsy Lawrenceville district.

It's got different levels of seating and a bar.

They have mostly those grass fed beef, locally sourced fresh meat.... WHATEVER burgers, some chicken and hot dogs.

I ordered the Pitts Burgher which had pickle, slaw, basil, special sauce and fries. I loved it.
My fries had salt and pepper on them. The salty fries were perfect with my burger.

I decided to order their salty dog with avocado, cream cheese, bacon and spices on a bagel bun. Unbeknownst to me they give you TWO of them!

The food here is good and fresh and heavily seasoned usually with a salty kick. Would love to stop back again!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for some time now.  I have heard people talk of it for a long time just making my wait that much longer.  It's like when you want something, but you just can't have it and having it rubbed in your face.

I like this place and the way it looks.  It's sleek, and minimal.  Nothing flashy about it, so modern like.  The day that I came here it must have been between busy hours which afforded us the chance to just walk in and sit wherever we wanted.  We chose the bar which made for quick service all around.  

The menu is straightforward.  You basically pick what you want, the description is point on which leaves nothing to be questioned.  Which is probably why I had a hard time deciding exactly what I wanted.  But I did end up making a good decision.  I went with the Morningside Burger, that's another thing to love about this place, all the burgers are named after the many different neighborhoods in the city.  More of a play on words than the neighborhood, the Morningside Burger is basically what it sounds like.  Plain and simple, bacon, egg and cheese.  Add some mayo and you got yourself a pretty amazing burger.  A perfectly smashed burger, seasoned so well and when those toppings are there, it's amazing.  A tip if you do get this, go with the dippy egg.  When that yolk breaks you get a little extra added bonus.  

As for the side, just go with the fries.  There are other sides you can get, but they won't be like these fries.  Pierogies, mac n cheese, rosemary fries, slaw, mixed greens salad; push them all to the side and go with the fries.  They are definitely hand cut.  No two fries are alike as they are cut literally by hand.  You may get a small fry but the next one may look like a steak fry.  Reminds me of doing something like that at home.  

And who could pass up a cold one with this meal?  Not I.  I had the 1890 draft.  This thing tasted so light to me.  Smooth and easy going.  Coming from nearby Zelienople it is a house brewed beer.  

One thing to also note here is that they do deliver, with a small fee."}
{"text":"We were hungry for hamburgers before we tucked in on a snowy night for March Madness & found Burgh'ers!  Fabulous!  A great atmosphere, cute bar, friendly & helpful employees.  We tried the Pitt's Burger & the Polish Hill Burger.  Both were delicious.  The mini is just the right size if you don't want a full burger.  The fries were yummy.  They bring Red Ribbon water bottles upon being seated.  What a nice beginning.  We had a craft beer which was great & I always love Red Ribbon Vanilla Cream Sodas when I can get one.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Took a Yelp suggestion and gave this place a try ! We had the Pickle Brine fried chicken sandwich and a Mexican War burger.
Yowza it was good stuff!! Thanks Yelp!!"}
{"text":"Burgh'ers is a winner for a casual meal in Lawrenceville. The highlights include friendly service, a menu with a wide variety of craft burgers, and specialty cocktails featuring spirits from Pennsylvania. I enjoyed the Mexican War burger. I really liked that the keto-friendly option of serving the burger on a romain wrap was right on the the menu - no special request necessary. There's also a vegetarian option. Very accommodating. The side salad with bleu cheese dressing was good too. On the Friday night I visited there was no wait for a two-top. There's plenty of room for small groups. I recommend Burgh'ers and I'll go back."}
{"text":"This place is really meh. I expected a lot more. The food is decent, though definitely not on the Burgatory/BRGR level at all. I can't really complain, decent service as well. But the real hook is: The food is TINY, the burger patties are like 4 ounces. And the sides are all tiny as well. And the prices are insanely high for those tiny sides/burgers. It's just completely not worth it. 2 people with 2 burger meals and a single appetizer should not cost upwards of $60. 

We have sooooo many better options around the burgh. I suggest stopping in once but repeats are just a drain on the wallet. Go to Burgatory, BRGR, 5 Guys, Wahlburgers, Stack'd... all better value and better tasting."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat and they have the best veggie burgers in Pittsburgh. Their veggie burgers don't taste like cardboard. Everything has so much flavor!!!! I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"As many of my reviews have stated in the past, you get points with me right of the bat if I can easily make a reservation online or with an app. Burgh'ers checked that box. 

It was freezing on the night we headed to the Lawrenceville location...and when we arrived we were hoping for a warm welcome, but the restaurant itself was so cold I kept my jacket on the whole time. Not so great.

We got the pierogi appetizer, which was pretty good - you only get 4 pierogis for $10...which is pretty lame.

I got the Polish Hill burger. I ordered it medium well and it definitely came out medium, but I'm not that picky and the burger was good. My husband got the make your own burger and was happy with his choice. The fries were good too.  

Overall, the food was good - nothing spectacular. Four stars because it wasn't cooked to order and the price point is steep for what you get (and the chilly atmosphere), but worth a try for the fun menu options."}
{"text":"We came in on a Friday and there was a good crowd. The hostess had stepped away so we waited a bit to be seated. All was taken care of and we sat down. The menu offers an interesting take on burgers, but we would have liked a bit more detail, e.g. what's the #theblend (meat and mushroom patty as our waitress answered when we inquired).

I ordered the Fox Chapel, which has #theblend as well as goat cheese, with balsamic. Hubs ordered the Mexican War. Our burgers were flavorful. As someone who doesn't crave meat, the mushroom mix was appreciated. The Mexican War had chillies in the patty, which offered a nice kick. The food was a decent size and I'm a fan of places that offer side salads in lieu of fries as a no charge option. The buns are very basic potato buns. I'd recommend the restaurant being more adventurous with that. 

The draft list has a good bit of options. Hubs got the ESB--fine option for the price. I got the Millennial Marmalade. It was sweeter than I'd like, but should have gathered by its name."}
{"text":"Just okay. We came on a Wednesday around 5pm and only 2 other people there. Ordered the forest hills burger, fried chicken, Morningside, and full macaroni and cheese. I'm not a fan of Bleu cheese (included with the burger) so I asked for cheddar but was told it would be an up charge. Why do you charge more for cheese when you are replacing with another cheese? Food came out and fries were cold and macaroni wasn't cooked the whole way. Burgers were a little small but tasted good. Chicken was nice sized. We had a Groupon but don't think we'd come back without another one. $14 for each burger, too expensive for what you get. Can go elsewhere for cheaper and better burger and fries"}
{"text":"Very trendy atmosphere where the food and brews are all local sourced. Great selection on tap! Not surprisingly they specialize in burgers with some terrific choices and a build your own if you don't find one to your liking. I had the \"Mexican War\" with its great buttery taste and some heat. The pierogis as a side were fantastic. Don't sleep on the fried chicken either. It too was a pleasure. Prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"Don't go here. Cold fries, order made wrong, cold, and just generally not executed well. Seems that the kitchen needs quality control and the dining room needs management. Plenty of other places to get a burger... If you are going to specialize in them, you need to get it right. Or at least try."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, cozy modern atmosphere, and great service! Can't ask for much more out of a burger joint...but wait....try the fried chicken, best in the Pittsburgh metro that I've had. Good beer and drink selection rounds out a great place to enjoy friends and a meal!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place from the first time I walked by.  Unfortunately it was a let down on multiple fronts.

First, the atmosphere is not at all welcoming.  It feels like a cafeteria inside.  There is very little decor, the floors and walls are just a bright white, there is a lot of open space, and it just has a weird vibe.  It does not set the scene well for a good eating experience.  The bar area did look cool so maybe I would try to sit there if I ever come back.

Onto the food.  Upon looking at the menu I immediately had a bad feeling because the menu says they \"smash\" their burgers.  I am not sure why this would be something you advertise.  I'm hoping by they mean prior to cooking they smash down the uncooked meat, rather than during cooking. 

I ordered the Maggie's Farm burger.  I was expecting a high quality burger given fact that burgers are their main focus, as well as the high prices.  What I got was nothing of the sort.  The burger patty is way too small.  If you are going to be selling five guys style burger patties that is fine, and I can enjoy a good thinner burger.  But to charge $13 or more for a thin smashed burger is absurd.  I ordered mine medium rare and it was over cooked.  I'm not sure if this is even the fault of the cook however because I don't know if it's possible to cook such a skinny patty to medium rare.  The burger also did not come out very hot.

The fries were good, as was the homemade ranch dressing.  The overall flavor of the burger was actually good, just not what I was expecting.  It reminded me of Red Robin.  An average piece of beef, but with some very good sauces and toppings.  I just wish they would price their food as such."}
{"text":"I can't wait to try this place again! I'm VERY picky about my burgers... I'd say I'm disappointed in most burgers that I try. Luckily, my meal at Burghers did not fall into that same sad category! 

I went with the Fox Chapel. The burger was a blend of beef and mushrooms, topped with goat cheese, greens, balsamic vinaigrette, pickled onion and avocado. I added a fried egg on top because I can't eat a burger without it. 

They serve their patties in a \"smash burger\" style where they come out pretty thin. I was worried that would automatically translate to the meat being overcooked but was pleasantly surprised that my medium rare order still had pink!

I went for a side of Mac and cheese instead of fries. It wasn't that hot when it came out, but the flavor was great and the noodles were still a little al dente, which I love. I'd try it again. I also tried a bite of my friend's fried chicken sandwich and liked it a lot. 

Our server, Bridget, was wonderful. Friendly, polite and easily answered all of our menu questions. 

Note: it's BYOB for now but they should be getting their liquor license shortly! There is a great bar space with the potential for a huge draft list. I'll be back once that happens!"}
{"text":"I had to try this new place. When I walked in, first first impression was how clean, open, and, new the place looked. I really liked the wooden table tops, they were beautiful. I appreciated the wheel chair accessibility to the second level, and that the floor was offset with to tiers as it was. I liked the open, high ceilings and industrial look of the place. The design is very modern. 
The only negative critique I have is how noisy it was. The tables were only about a third capacity and I imagine the noise only getting worse with more being served.
Service was good, I was seated immediately, no wait. The waitress did an ok job, but, didn't do anything to be welcoming or introduce anything about the place it the menu. With it being new I kind of expected more from the wait staff.
The food was ok. I had the rosemary fries, they were seasoned well, didn't need anything added, they had a nice crunch to them, tasted fresh, and, I'd have them again. I had the Pitts burger. The portion was very very small for the price. I requested rare but got medium well instead. You can see that in the photo I'll add.
Overall, I think they have some work to do. Such as something to decrease the noise; curtains, drapes, cloth to catch the echo. And either the portion has to go up or the price come down, but, the hamburger was worth a third of the tab. I was left asking, \"where's the beef\". Again, look at the photo. I will try and give them a second chance in a month or so."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh. One of the best burgers I have ever eaten! Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"I've been to the original location in Harmony and never had a bad experience. Hopefully this place will end up giving the same service. Unfortunately the rosemary fries came out like warm and very soggy and the fried chicken had a nice taste to it but had way too much breading and always fell off the chicken. Also... they don't put any pricing on their cocktail list. So I have no clue if I'm paying 6.00 or 15.00 for my drinks."}
{"text":"I was looking for something good to eat on my way home from the city. I remembered that I had a Groupon and decided to try out Burgh'ers. I mean, who doesn't love a great burger?
 
It wasn't busy in the restaurant when we arrived. There were only a few people at a few tables, which was great because I was really hungry. However, I have to say that our service was very slow. It took a long time for us to give our order. Then a family of 5 came in much after us and they received their meals before us. My mom and I actually even ordered the same exact thing, so it was a very easy order.

Outside of the slow service, the burger was good. I ordered the Forest Hills burger. It had bleu cheese, honey, mushrooms, and mixed greens.  It was cooked well and plated nicely. I also got rosemary fries. There is an upcharge for it, but they were really good.

The atmosphere was relaxed. Your typical mixed industrial feel. There were big TVs over the bar area and it has an open kitchen. 

I would try out the restaurant again. The food was good enough for a return visit."}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend and I was not sure what to expect. I had been to BRGR and Burgatory before and had not been overly impressed. I was pleasantly surprised by the industrial decor upon entering. 

The service was fast and friendly. When we ordered, I had originally planned to get a mini burger, but our server suggested the larger as it was twice the portion size for a $3 up-charge. 

Our food came out quickly; I had the Maggie's Farm and my girlfriend had the Fox Chapel. Both of us were very impressed. She went as far as to say that it was the best burger that she had had. I would certainly put it in my top 5. We both decided to get the Rosemary Fries as an upgrade and theh were flavorful and refreshing. The portions were spot on and left both of us feeling satisfied, but not overly full. I will definitely be coming back here when I'm in town next time."}
{"text":"Good burgers! NOT many burger places I can eat at without salt on th table. Put salt on table please."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a new lunch spot and this popped up as a suggestion. 

When we got there it was sort of an \"industrial\" type interior atmosphere but everything looked very new and nice. Our waitress was attentive and fast. We ordered the bagel type hot dog appetizer and that was very interesting and very delicious. Only thing is I wish they would have toasted the hot dog bun and put a little more avocado on the bread. Otherwise very tasty! My husband made his own burger and I got a chicken sandwich with side salad. The food was EXCELLENT. Chicken sandwich was fresh and bun stayed crisp, not soggy, despite the multiple  toppings on the sandwich. My husband's burger was cooked to the right temp and his rosemary fries were AMAZING (obviously I had to try some). Overall this place was excellent and he has already been back since our visit. Highly recommended

P.S. the plates reminded me of eating lunch at someone's grandma's house and I LOVED IT"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were excited to try this place since it's so close to our apartment and have gone a couple times now. Unfortunately, it's just ok, nothing great. It probably won't become a regular spot we check out very often.

Our first visit was during their soft opening, my boyfriend had a basic double cheeseburger and fries. I had the Mexican War burger without the chilies and paid the $1 extra for the rosemary fries. We split a chocolate milkshake. The milkshake was made with Millie's ice cream, which was the selling point. However it was kind of poorly made, it looked kind of like the blender was broken, it was kind of just mushed up ice cream with some milk added to it. It was thick in parts, but then super soupy in other parts. We decided it wasn't a big deal since it was their soft opening, it was still decent just because it was made with Mille's ice cream. 

My boyfriends double burger was huge, despite the pattys being a little thinner than some other places around town. He said that the burger itself was very salty though. My burger was ok, but nothing super great. I felt like that patty was a little thinner than I was used to. It's honestly hard to compete as a burger joint in the city now when there are already some places doing REALLY good burgers. (Burgatory, Smoke's Burger night, The Vandal, etc) I wouldn't pay $1 extra for the rosemary fries again, they were literally just the same fries my boyfriend got with rosemary flakes sprinkled on them. There were a couple other items on the menu we wanted to try, and it was only their soft opening so we decided we'd be back.

On our second visit, the service was kind of slow. We waited close to 20 min before someone came over to us to ask for our drink orders. When we did get to order, both of us got chicken sandwiches. My boyfriend got a simple grilled chicken sandwich and I got their fried chicken sandwich. He got fries again, I asked for mac & cheese but they were out, so I got a side salad. Since they were out of mac and cheese we decided to try the fried goat cheese bites as an app, I love goat cheese! The goat cheese bites were $9 for 4 little bites, which is a little on the pricer side in my opinion, especially because they weren't that good. When I bit into them they were mostly hollow with some goat cheese attached to the breading on the inside (think a mozzarella stick that the cheese has slipped out of). I only had 1 bite that had much cheese in it. The goat cheese is also herbed goat cheese, which isn't explained on the menu. My boyfriend said his grilled chicken was salty again and it was pickle brined as well, which isn't explained on the menu. He doesn't like pickles. My fried chicken sandwich HUGE, but it was just ok taste-wise, the breading kept slipping off as some other reviewers mentioned. The side salad was ok, the ranch dressing seemed like it was missing something. Overall we found this place to be kind of mediocre so we unfortunately probably won't be back much."}
{"text":"We loved this place! This restaurant is a great addition to all the great businesses in Lawrenceville! This place reeks of pittsburgh with the black and gold chairs, toilets, wall art, and menu. Most of there burgers are named after areas in pittsburgh (shadyside, Lawrenceville, strip district...). We bought Lawrenceville (a burger with mayonnaise and a pierogi), and shady side (with honey and other ingredients). Both were amazing, and the fries they came with were great. The staff was friendly, and it was spotless. My favorite part was the restrooms. The toilets and sinks were black and gold. This restaurant dedicates itself to the town. I would highly recommend you visit this place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to stop at burghers for pittsburgh restaurant week to take advantage of their special deal, and I am so glad we did. 

Service was great, we were greeted and seated immediately (we also had a reservation.) The server brought us a bottle of water for the table, which I LOVE because I am always guzzling down my water.

Food came out quick, I had the fox chapel burger with #theblend patty (50 percent beef 50 percent mushroom) and it was delicious! Fries were good and we had a large helping.

This might be the best burger I've had in Pittsburgh so far living here, keep it up burghers!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great burgers, fried chicken, appetizers...haven't had anything to complain about yet! Service is excellent! Very personable and friendly staff. All natural choices prepared to please, even the beverages."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday before the rush, and had an amazing meal in an atmosphere best described as casually cool.  Our server was quick to respond and knew the menu back to front.  She brought out a macaroni and cheese appetizer that was fierce!  Cheesy, springy, zesty and DELISH!!!!  Our main courses were the shadyside and the polish hill burgers surrounded in a sea of crispy french fries.  My rosemary fries were UNREAL.  The burgers are a thin seasoned patty, topped generously.  Make sure you order a chocolate shake for the trip home...it's made with Millie's local ice cream, you'll thank me later.
The bar and tabletops are made from local trees acquired in Butler.  Everything in the whole place is local, from the meat to the toppings to the glasses you drink out of.  Hell, even the bathroom screams Pittsburgh....

FOR EVERYONE ON YELP THAT WANTS A 6 DOLLAR BURGER AND THINKS THAT A POOR REVIEW IS WARRANTED FOR YOUR WALLET BEING UPSET, GO TO EAT N PARK.  I think Hardee's also has a cheap dirty meat wad you can shove down your pie hole."}
{"text":"We walked in and before we were fully seated the server asked if we were ready to order. We asked for a minute to look over the menu and literally never saw her again. We waited for 20 minutes before just getting up and leaving. We also had our baby with us, which doesn't demand special treatment necessarily - but I always appreciate a server who understands how helpful it is to be prompt when you have young children with you. To add insult, the other server working was leaning on the bar on her phone and the restaurant wasn't very busy - a total of 4 tables sat."}
{"text":"Burgh'ers is one part 50's throwback burger joint, one part hipster L'ville eatery, and all parts delicious. I like the fact that they locally source a lot of their ingredients...you really can taste the  difference in quality. On our recent visit, my hubby and I sampled a variety of their offerings. We started with the pierogie appetizer, which included four pierogies each topped with a mountain of caramelized onions. The pierogies themselves appeared to be fried, with a crispy outer shell and a delicious, soft, fluffy filling. They were a perfect pairing with those sweet onions. Were they worth the $10 price tag? Probably not. But still a delicious way to begin our meal.

For dinner, my husband ordered the Maggie's Farm burger, and I decided to indulge with a custom pickle-brined fried chicken sandwich. My husband opted for the standard side of fries that comes with each burger, but being the mac and cheese fiend that I am, I decided to upgrade my side so that I could try theirs (I mean, if I'm going to indulge, I might as well go all in, right?) When my meal came out, I first thought that my waitress had made a mistake and put in my order with double meat, because my sandwich was comprised of TWO fried chicken breasts! But nope, that was not a mistake....their regular chicken sandwiches are just HUGE! And lemme tell you, it was a tasty sandwich! The chicken was super crispy and juicy and had the most delicious salty pickle flavor that stood up well against the rich, creamy cheese and other indulgent accoutrements on my sandwich. So good....and so big that I was able to save one entire chicken breast from the sandwich to take home with me for lunch the next day. As for the mac and cheese side, it was fairly basic, but definitely tasty. A lot of the cheese sauce pooled to the bottom of the bowl, so I had to stir it up with the pasta. The sauce was creamy and well-seasoned, but given that it was an extra $3.00, I'm not sure that it's worth the upcharge, especially considering the fries that come standard with a meal are delicious. Speaking of which....yes, I stole several fries that came with my hubby's burger and they were awesome. I'm not a beef eater, so I didn't try his burger, but he reported that it was cooked exactly as he asked for (medium) and was one of the better burgers that he's had in the 'Burgh. 

Yes, it's pricey, but I think the food quality helps to justify the price. On my next visit, I would probably skip the appetizer and the mac and cheese upgrade, which would allow us to get out of there for around $30....very reasonable! We'll certainly be adding Burgh'ers to the ever-growing list of places to get a good burger/sandwich around the area!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  I highly recommend the Rosemary Fries, they were surprisingly light and had just enough seasoning.  The salad is great, garlic vinaigrette is very good. I chose to build my own burger with chicken, great portion size and the toppings were perfect.  Only complaint I would have is how long our food took.  The restaurant had plenty of empty tables and our table of 4 waited about 40 minutes for our food."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here with a friend.  Fun, creative menu.  Good friendly service.  Fresh local ingredients.  Nothing here not to like.  No fanfare, no hassle.

TBH, I hope it doesn't become too popular.  There's a quiet laid back vibe to this place.  That could be lost if it gets too popular."}
{"text":"A solid burger place to have in the neighborhood. The flavors of the veggie burger itself were overpowering but I'd be open to trying to some of the other selections. The toppings were fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers and fries served on mismatched China plates. The mini burger comes with a generous serving of fries. The rosemary fries are topped with fresh rosemary. The seating area is kind of loud, so maybe don't bring your elderly grandparents during the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Solid food. We had the Fox Chapel and the Shadyside and they were both super tasty. Rosemary fries and Mac n cheese were both good as well. My biggest complaint is that at $13 each, I'd like to see more actual burger on the burger. With the Groupon voucher this place is a good value. Without the voucher, not so much."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place ever since I heard the news we had a Burgh'ers opening. I had no idea whether or not it was affiliated with the Burgh'ers I had years ago in Harmony, PA but I secretly hoped it was because it was the best burger I ever had. That chance finally came when I saw Burgh'ers listed on the Pittsburgh restaurant week specials. 

After much debating I went with the Mexican war burger simply because it was something different and because Good Food Pittsburgh labeled it as one of the top 10 dishes to try for restaurant week. Typically it's not the burger I would have chosen but why not try something new, right?! I was very pleased with my decision. The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors blended together so well. I was sad to see it slowly disappear. 

This is one place I will definitely be visiting again and again. I would highly recommend people try it if they haven't already. As I write this I'm already thinking about when I can go back."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of the original Burgh'ers, located in Harmony/Zelienople since they first opened.  This new location in Lawrenceville, brings delicious farm-to-table burgers into the city.  This location is in a brand new building, and has a modern look, with a little bit of Pittsburgh flair to include black & gold seating.  Today was the first day of their soft opening to the public.  Most of the burgers on the menu are named after Pittsburgh neighborhoods (They do have some other items on the menu that are not burgers also).  Today I enjoyed a \"Bloomfied\" burger, which has Swiss crisp sautéed greens, caramelized onions, fennel, mayo, and pepper flakes, and a side of fresh-cut fries.  The service was fast and friendly, and owner Chef Fiore even came out to ask me how everything was . . . it was excellent.  Look forward to coming back again, especially after they complete their liquor license so I can have a craft beer to go along with my burger."}
{"text":"Came here for their soft opening, friends and family night. Great beer and burgers! I'm friends with the master brewer and his beer is awesome."}
{"text":"I would give this place a solid 3.5, but since I can't, and I'm feeling generous, I'll round up. The interior is industrial-chic and clean. The music was also a bit loud considering the poor acoustics of the place, which made it difficult to talk during a business lunch. It wasn't very busy went I went for lunch during a weekday, but the service was good. Our waiter was attentive and we got our food pretty fast. I ordered a Maggie's Farm mini impossible burger with a side salad. Let me just said that I love that so many places in Pittsburgh are getting the impossible burger. Anyways, the burger was very good. Full of flavor. The salad was good as well. The portion was perfect and I was full by the end. I will say the price is high for what you get. I understood I was getting a small burger, but for only two dollars less than the regular size one, I felt a little jipped. Overall, a good place to add to the rotation and I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"We went here after going to the one in Harmony a few years ago (plus I bought a Groupon). There's pay street parking available. 

I had the Maggie's Farm burger, which was topped with smoked Gouda, caramelized onions and smoked chilies. The burger was cooked exactly how I wanted. I had a side of the rosemary fries and honestly, those stole the show! Perfectly fried and seasoned, I'm drooling thinking about them!  I loved how the food came out on mismatched China. The plates were beautiful and made me feel like I was eating at a relative's house :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night for a bit to eat. They have a wide menu or burgers to choose from with different meats, and of course you can build your own burger.  The burgers come with a side of rosemary fries which are very delicious. I got a build your own burger for $10.  The burger was good and cooked to my liking, but the toppings looked like they were just kinda tossed on without care.  The red onions where chunky and not cut into small slices, which I hate because most people don't like biting into a big piece of onion. Over all the place is not horrible, but if you want a great burger I would recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here this past Saint Patty's day. Nick was an amazing server. Not only was he attentive and a delightful presence, he took his time answering all of our questions about the menu. 

I had the Fox Chapel and their house brewed Hipster Tone IPA. The food was delicious and I didn't feel icky after my burger and fries. This is a testament to their quality, fresh in ingredients. Their beer was also amazing. As an IPA lover, It was my first time having a Northeastern IPA and I'm sold. 

Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, overrated, and really just a frustrating and mediocre experience as a whole. For some strange reason, they don't allow substitutions of any kind. If you want to switch the cheese on a burger that you're ordering from the menu, even if the cheeses cost the same on the customized menu, they charge you a dollar extra. Want to trade out one veggie for another? That'll be a dollar too. They even charge 50 cents for putting ketchup on your burger, despite the fact that there are already ketchup bottles on the table! The burgers themselves are pretty mediocre, honestly no better than fast food burgers that you can get for a fifth of the price. And the service is unbearably slow, with orders taking ages even at off-peaks hours of the day. Given the fact that burger places are ubiquitous these days, I seriously recommend staying away from this place and finding somewhere better to eat."}
{"text":"This was my first visit.  There weren't many people in the restaurant but my daughter and I had to wait about 45 minutes for our food. We would have left but we had a Groupon.  I hate when I see someone who came in after us receive their food before us. 

I don't blame the waiter because he doesn't cook the food. Darin our waiter was pleasant and met our needs.

I ordered the \"Forest Hills\" and swapped the bleu cheese for gouda with a half order of fresh fries. The burger was moist and flavorful and the fries were nicely crisped."}
{"text":"Great Burgers and atmosphere! All fresh organic farm to table burgers. Got the Maggie's farm burger which came with rum aioli, chilies, caramelized onions, and smoked gouda. Mac and cheese was delicious too. Friendly staff with quick service, and the owner even comes out to check on his customers. Will be back plenty of times in the near future."}
{"text":"You can't really have enough burger joints. That is a scientific fact. 
Burgh'ers really stands true as a Pittsburgh Proud local burger stop and I enjoyed it.

Between the Pittsburgh-themed decor, the burrow-themed burger names or the fact that the majority of what they serve is locally sourced, Burgh'ers is really Pittsburghy. 

I got the fox chapel burger and I really enjoyed it. #TheBlend (50% meat, 50% mushroom) was unique and tasty. Really a great burger if you're a fan of goat cheese. The pierogies we got for the table($10) were also delicious, but the menu doesn't point out that they serve you 4 and they are fried. That is all fine, I'm sure I could've just asked but $2.50 a pierogi is expensive(even though they are also locally sourced.)  

Kristen was a joy to have as a hostess as well, accommodating and friendly; Not to mention she stuck around to answer the random questions we had about the plates, owner, her preferences etc.

All in all, good burger, good service, decent prices. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Every bite at this relaxed open plan restaurant was delicious. Lamar, the server, was energetic and friendly, and there was no drama getting me seated. I had the Polish Hill burger- which has a fried pierogi on top. The burger tasted like a homemade beef patty, the pierogi was fresh and chewy in just the right way, and the fries were superb (and salty). Really just a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Average food- I feel the place was kinda hyped up more than the flavor of the burgers came out to be.  Kinda pricy for ok food. I tried the impossible burger (The one made to have the appearance of meat but made of veggies) and it was sweet and a little crumbly. I'll give it another try but probably not here. My other friend's  burgers also had oddly sweet notes to them which left them dissatisfied. Fires were ok. The fried goat cheese appetizer was sub par. If you want to do a custom burger it seems way more expensive than just sucking it up and getting one that they had on the menu. I might give this place a second try but it wasn't my favorite"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good burger at lesser price, Five Guys or Red Robin may be for you. If you want to drink good beer while listening to music and enjoying nice decor, the burgers here are comparable yet more expensive. If you're in Lawrenceville on a Tuesday, Smoke's burger rules."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the locally driven menu and you can taste the freshness. Meat hangs over the bun, great local beers, dressing for salad were all delicious."}
{"text":"Best Burgers in the Burgh! Rumor has it they're working on their own locally brewed beer too, can't wait to try it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim last night for dinner. The place was fairly empty so service was quick, which we appreciated. We truly have no clue what the drinking situation is - there is a bar but it didn't seem to be a functioning one, plus we saw tables with a 12-pack of beer, so I guess it is BYOB? No clue. Pop is expensive @ $3/each, and I am assuming you pay for refills since they were brought out in a can & a bottle. Our burgers were really good. I got the Shadyside and my boyfriend got the Polish Hill. We loved both. Definitely expensive though at $13 each for what seemed like a 1/4lb patty. We both got cheese fries as well and they were delicious. Overall - the food is pretty good but too pricey in my opinion. With so many other great restaurants in the area and burger places throughout Pittsburgh, we probably won't make the trip back."}
{"text":"Came here a few days after opening. Our server was very nice and attentive. The burgers were great--juicy and flavorful! Upgraded to the rosemary fries and was verrrry happy with that decision!
Ended the evening with shakes made with Millie's ice cream...so delicious.
All in all the experience was great, my only qualm was the price! Husband upgraded to a bison burger and it was ~$18!! Yikes!"}
{"text":"A very good burger, slightly on the pricier side (on the level of Burgatory) but better than most of the competition. The burgers are smashed-style, like Shake Shack or Fatburger. Staff is fast and friendly, and the restaurant is clean. Sides (fries and salad) are solid and very good, respectively. A good drink selection. On the quieter end of Lawrenceville so not quite as busy as some other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"You close at 9!!!  My Grandmother stayed awake longer than that, God rest her soul!!!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you how I even tried this place for a second time. My boyfriend and I were driving down the street discussing what to eat. He asked, \"if you could eat a burger where would you go?\" And he listed a places we could go and we discovered that Burghers was the one place you could get a good burger, amazing fries, and a good milkshake. 

This trip we tried the Bloomfield and were we blown away. This is simply the best burger ever. It's full of flavor and fresh ingredients. I mean we wish there was a Garfield burger in the menu but until then we will say this is the best to us."}
{"text":"Th food always taste fresh. The portions seem small but by time you're finished it's the perfect amount of full. I suggest the Maggie farmhouse burger. There's usually some kinda deal on Groupon for this place, which I do not understand but I am not complaining. Do not get the Mac n cheese, unless you plan on using it to mortar a brick house. The salads are delicious. The chicken also is very good crispy and lite"}
{"text":"This hurt my cred with friends.

Mondays are a difficult day for me and my crew to find places to eat that we really like as most breweries and hot spots are closed Mondays.  Seeing that I've been to and enjoyed my visit to Burgh'ers Zelienople location I recommended it.  Whoops.

We sat at the bar and the place was spotted with patrons, not busy.  I enjoyed the look and feel and compliments for a clean atmosphere.  The bartender was friendly enough and offered up the drink menu.  I know Burgh'ers brews their own beer and I am not really a fan, so after seeing the tap and bottle list I opted for just a water.  My friends also passed on alcohol and to that it seemed like the good service halted.  Slow and aloof which is a trait all too common throughout the city took the place of attentive and cordial.

Enough about that though as this is purely an astute assumption.  We all ordered sliders and fries and were pumped to be able to sample a few of Burgh'ers unique burger combinations.  The fries came out half done, soggy, bland, and under seasoned.  A fry, how hard is a fry to cook?  We were asked how we wanted our sliders cooked and as someone who has slung many burgers in his time my buddy asked how on Earth you could cook a slider to temperature (not much meat).  Odd and they all came out well done which was fine and expected.  A couple of us got jalapenos on the burgers and boy were they hot.  I love spicy food and ended up ditching the majority of them.  All and all the sliders were just okay and I had wished I grabbed something else from their menu.  Check out my review of the Zelienople branch to see I do like some of their menu items.

I really wanted this to be good as it was my recommendation to a few foodies, but alas it disappointed.  This will be tough sledding in a very competitive Lawrenceville market."}
{"text":"We had to eat a second dinner here after morcilla since the plates were so small, although delicious. I ordered a mini Maggie's farm. It was the perfect end to our second dinner. The burger was juicy, flavorful, and I loved the addition of the chile/pepper. I didn't taste much horseradish, but it doesn't matter. The burger was great. It came with a side salad with garlic vinaigrette. Loved the dressing, loved the lettuce. My friend ordered the fries. They are thin and perfectly seasoned. I love how this place uses salt. There is a perfect shard of salt in every bite.  Salt angel. We travelled to the harmony location several times based on some article about them being the best burger in Pittsburgh and I'm happy they opened their second location in Pittsburgh. I hate the metal plates in harmony though, they mess with my body."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Had a veggie burger that wife really loved, and a Maggie's Farm Burger. Also the rosemary french fries. Good craft beer selection too! The only negative was lack of acoustic material in the area...hard floors, walls and ceilings and only took a 3/4 full crowd to make the voices deafening!"}
{"text":"Local and Organic burgers with some uniquely crafted toppings or build your own burger.  What's not to like! 

Have been to the first Burgher's in Harmony and was in the mood for a good burger so we stopped by.  

The restaurant is nicely done with a long bar but do not have a liquor license yet so it is BYOB.  The street sign advertised BYOB and our waiter said they are planning on getting a liquor license but it sounded like it will be a while.  So bring along a couple of beers or some wine to enjoy with your burger.

Service was fast and friendly. 

I had the Pitts burger that has cheddar, slaw, pickle, basil, onion and a special sauce.  My burger was cooked to my order and was tasty.  I thought the toppings were good but the special sauce seemed to lack that Zip I was expecting.  Just had the regular fries and they are very good and you get a larger portion.  Maybe next visit we will have one of the For the Table/appetizers."}
{"text":"We've been here several times since it's really close to where we live and I've been impressed every time. The pickle-brined chicken might be my favorite, it's massive and super flavorful. When ordering a burger, it's always cooked perfectly. Their roasted garlic dressing is really fantastic too!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop in here for the last few months since I go to a hair salon across the street. I finally managed to go on a Thursday afternoon about 2:15pm. Since it was off peak, there were only a few tables with guests & no one at the bar. I sat at the bar since I was alone. I was asked if I had any questions about the beer & didn't realize they brewed their own & had a restaurant (and their brewery) in Zelienople, who knew? They gave me a taste (a rather large taste I might add in these cute tiny Pilsner glasses) of their ale & IPA and both were delicious. 

I ordered the Maggie's Farm burger which came with Gouda, horseradish, carmelized onions, roasted chilies & rum aioli. You could really tell that it was a fresh made burger & the horseradish & chilies gave it a good kick. The bun was soft, and the fries were fresh cut & plentiful. They also have rosemary fries for $1 more. 

I look forward to visiting their Zelienople location soon & was told they plan to expand to the old Mellon Bank Building on Main St & will eventually have a rooftop deck!

Returned early June: On Thursdays they have $4 house wine by the glass all day. Red is a Merlot, White is a Pinot Grigio. I choose the white & it was a nice dry not too fruity wine that was perfect for 4 bucks. I chose the Fox Chapel which features \"the blend\" which is a combo of beef & mushrooms in the burger, plus goat cheese, greens, onion, avocado & balsamic. It came with a lot of hand cut fries. The burgers remind me of one you'd make yourself at home. Not fancy or huge, but tasty & just enough. It's worth a stop for a burger & fries."}
{"text":"Awesome burger!!!
Fast, friendly service.
Try the fried goat cheese appetizer.  I'm not from around here but will be back."}
{"text":"The beer and soda list is pretty impressive; and, the fries are fantastic. Unfortunately, those are the only nice things I have to say. On a relatively slow day, two hours past the typical lunch rush, our service was awful. It took over an hour for just a couple of sliders and fries - not to mention how ridiculously expensive the sliders are. I'll make it easy for you: skip Burgh'ers and got to BRGR or Burgatory for a good, quick, reasonably priced burger."}
{"text":"Even with a groupon, this place disappointed! Friendly service, attentive service but when I addressed two things - the macaroni and cheese was too salty and my daughter couldn't eat it, nothing was offered to correct the situation. When our food first arrived, there was an immediate check to see if all was good. First bite was good, then we were not checked on until the end of the meal, where the two complaints were made. My other complaint was the fried chicken, the first bite was good until I realized that all three of the pieces on my plate were dark meat. I can tolerate dark meat but I did not expect the meal to be entirely dark meat. I would have never ordered it. When I expressed my disappointment,  again no offer to remedy the situation. 

The three burgers that were ordered at the table were all tasty but the consensus was that they ran small for the pricing of them. The fries were delicious and plentiful. The draft beers were great. Stick to burgers and fries and if you don't mind the pricing for the patty size, you will be fine. We much prefer the 16.00 huge, multi meat cut burger at Eleven.

There was plenty of loud music to be heard. I don't know if every day is 80's day but you can manage to tune out the Phil Collins and Billy Joel if you try."}
{"text":"This was probably the best burger I have ever had. The fries are just as good. Vanilla milkshake was the real deal. Mexican War was spicy and flavorful, the Shadyside was mushroom heaven and the Pittsburgher was traditional amazing."}
{"text":"When I see that the food served is locally sourced not only am I delighted with it but I know I have to pay extra for it. This is the 2nd location of this restaurant that has the original in Harmony, PA. I liked the motif with the black and gold chairs perfectly arranged so that each table had at least one of each color.

My waitress was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu to me. One of the things of note is make sure you ask when ordering because there is an up-charge for most everything whether written or not. For example when I was deciding the type of bun I wanted for my burger I learned that a whole wheat bun would cost $1.00 extra. Most of your sandwiches come with a side of either French Fries or salad with dressing of your choice. If you want cole slaw then it is a $3.00 upcharge along with macaroni and cheese. Those are written on the menu. You can order sides but if you are price wary then make sure to ask before ordering.

In addition to burgers you can order chicken sandwiches, salads,  BLT, or grilled cheese.
You have several options when it comes to ordering burgers. You can either order a premade burger from their list or build your own burger. Your additional choices for an upcharge give you the following options: \"the blend\" which means it will have part mushroom filler, \"the double down\" which is about 1/2 pound of ground meat, and \"wild game\" which would be another meat. In today's case it was bison for a $4.00 upcharge. Some of these burgers are can be veggie burgers or have no meat in them whatsoever.

I decided to order the Forest Hills burger which came with blue cheese, sauteed mushroom. mixed greens and honey. I actually didn't have to wait too long for it. The salad side was indeed generous and the burger was cooked just to order and I could taste the freshness in it.  I had the feeling that even though the fries were good I knew I wouldn't be able to finish them.

In addition to milkshakes made with Millie's ice cream, today they were offering ice cream sandwiches. The cost was about $7.00. The ice cream sandwich consisted of two cookies supplied by Mediterra bread and Millie's ice cream as a filler. I was told it would be large enough for two people to share so I decided to pass on it. 

Behind me stood the bar with hand crafted brews. At the far end was the chef's prep area. The place was very clean and I was very pleased with my lunch. I am looking forward to trying out their other location in Harmony, Pa when the occasion warrants it."}
{"text":"While the staff are friendly, the burgers were only ok. I got the Maggie's farm burger and I was disappointed the cheese wasn't melted and seemed like it was slapped on at the end. Same thing with the Mexican war burger, the cheese wasn't melted at all. The green chilis also were one big chunk so it wasn't spread well and would come out in one bite. The buns appeared to be regular white bread buns without sesame seeds. The upgrade to the rosemary fries for $1 was definitely worth it though. Overall, the burgers were just ok and not worth the $13. There is also metered street parking."}
{"text":"Ya know that feeling when you are disappointed you just threw that money away? That's how I felt at Burgh'ers. Another overpriced / underwhelming burger joint jumping on the burger-craze train.
The staff was all very nice. The food is all over priced, especially for the portion size. $13 for their standard burger. The guy next to me got his burger while I waited for mine, and I just assumed he bought the smaller $10 size burger. Well, you know what they say about assuming...
The burger patty was pretty small and flat, but it was seasoned well. Nothing like you would expect for the price. Similar sized to a single patty at Five Guys. 
The restaurant also feels cold and lifeless. Not warm and welcoming at all. And with the concrete ceilings and no sound absorbing materials, it was very loud even with the small amount of people there at the time.
Save your money and go to Five Guys instead."}
{"text":"The best Burger joint with great craft brews and not to mention arguably the best fried chicken in the burg"}
{"text":"What burger joint charges you for a side of Mayo?  When you pay 13.00 bucks for a burger you expect condiments for free.
NOT COMING BACK"}
{"text":"Just go here.  

The Zelionople classic has expanded to Butler St.  If you're bored with the usual suspects, meander on over to Burgh'ers' newest location in Lawrenceville.  Incredible service and they are opening a full bar in the near future.  Oh yeah, and the fries? Yep."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and I'm a fan! The service was quick and friendly. I had the Shadyside burger and ordered it medium well - I think it was a little more cooked than I prefer it, so next time I'll get it medium. The burger itself was well seasoned and the toppings were perfect. Their grilled mushrooms are especially delicious! I had regular fries with my burger and they were nice and crispy. Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"Nothing kicks off my weekend better than a burger. Burgh'ers is very new compared to other burger joints around the city. They offer a variety of signature burgers, but they also provide a build-your-own option which was what I went for. All their burgers come with a side of fries or side salad. I ordered the veggie burger on a lettuce wrap with cream cheese, caramelized onions, cole slaw, and topped with their special sauce which is similar to a thousand island. They offer some unique toppings and yes, I made it my mission to create the weirdest combo which, surprisingly, didn't turn out too bad! Warning for anyone getting cream cheese, they don't just spread it on. They give you a huge slab of it so approach with caution. My biggest complaint is that the veggie patty itself is VERY salty and not as full as others I've had like Burgatory or BRGR. Not very impressed.

I was a huge fan of the restaurant atmosphere. Very open and bright with large windows along the walls. It has a modern industrial vibe with the metal chairs and exposed hvac ducts. Chill and casual for a nice lunch or dinner.

Service was great throughout our visit. The waiters punch in your order as you tell them what you want which makes the process so much more efficient. Anything to get my food faster!"}
{"text":"Latest addition to the already booming Lawrenceville. The food is ok. Maggie's Farm burger is smoked Gouda horse radish caramelized onion roasted chiles and rum aioli is decent. Honestly I've had way better burgers elsewhere. Rosemary fries fell flat in flavor and came out cold.
Decor is industrial and fresh with modern twists on soda fountain, etc. For being open less than a week I will give another shot. Service is friendly but the server we had was confused, unsure and our initial order came out wrong.
***update***
It's been a couple of weeks and I'm sad to say all I've written above still holds true. The food is just ok; nothing more."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh and craving a burger this is the place to go. Farm to table excellence! We went with the Maggie's Farm and Morningside. Both cooked to order and perfection! The rosemary and fresh cut fries are well worth it too. Highly recommend and they serve veggie options as well. We will definitely return on our next trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great, the food was good! The burgers were really good but they seemed a little small, but maybe that is just because I'm not used to being able to even get my mouth around a burger from most places. The fries were eh, tasted a little old and getting the rosemary fries wasn't worth the extra $1"}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOD!
I went to try Burgh'ers on a groupon because I was interested in the locally sourced meats and produce. I am generally a 5 guys fan but not really into places like Burgatory. I found this place to be an awesome in between place. The décor is bright modern and industrial. Very bright and clean. I was greeted warmly at the door and directed to the bar. 

My order was for takeout and as I waited I was able to take advantage of the $4.00 Faber drinks special. The bartender was very pleasant and very knowledgeable about the drinks and the menu. never having had Faber spirits before he was able to answer my questions about the brand.

I ordered the Fox Chapel and the Maggie's farm burgers on potato bun with added bacon with the standard fries and salad. These burgers were good, very good. I tried them both with #theblend patties which are half beef and half mushroom. The burgers were better than any I've had. Tender and perfectly cooked. The reason that I gave them 4 stars is because even though I paid for bacon and ordered these on potato buns they came out bacon less on brioche. That being said, and I don't think I have ever said this before, I didn't miss the bacon. The burger was so good I didn't even notice the bacon was missing until halfway through. The brioche bun was soft and sweet and perfectly complemented the flavors of the burger. So even though they didn't get it right they got it right. 

This is not a cheap burger joint so expect 10 -15 per burger depending on add ons but it is worth it. They have chicken and blt's that I didn't try but turned my head when they came out of the kitchen. They even have the option of wild game meats and fried pierogies. 

Groupon is running a few different deals for this place and you should get one. I just bought 2 more and am going back tomorrow. Hope to see you there."}
{"text":"First time visitor. Very cool decor in the place, high ceilings and lots of seating as well as a big bar to sit at. Great server that we had , he took our orders quickly and with a great attitude. He definitely made the meal better. 2 If is had build your own burgers and they were super tasty. Nice size and cooked perfectly . The rosemary fries were very tasty as well as the Mac and cheese which was super yummy and cheesy. One of us had the impossible burger which is vegan and I truly could not taste any difference than the full fat beef burger we were eating. I was blown away at how great hat burger tasted. Excellent draft list and cocktail list. Only weird thing was they only had soda in single cans , maybe the other sodas were free refills but a Diet Coke was in a can. I will be back to this place without hesitation . Check it out you will dig it."}
{"text":"Burghers was exceptional! We ate there on a Thursday evening and it wasn't super crowded, there were a few other couples/families. Everyone working was so nice, like put a smile on your face kind of nice. Between us we ordered the Fox Chapel Burger, Polish Hill Burger, and Everything Bagel Hot Dogs. The burgers were cooked to perfection and the toppings complimented each other perfectly. The smell from the rosemary fries is amazing, and the bagel dogs could be a meal by themselves. We will definitely be back to try other Burger combinations and apps."}
