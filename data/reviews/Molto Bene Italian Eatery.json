{"text":"I heard good feedback on this new place and wanting to support local independents I eagerly headed there last Saturday with my beau. Sadly, I'm compelled  to give a low rating for a couple of reasons but mainly because of the poor service. I ordered a veal dish that arrived tableside barely warm and with nothing but a side of mushrooms slathered in an unappealing grey sauce. The side was an anemic salad with a bland dressing. I politely asked for a small side of spaghetti  and our server was taken aback by the request. (The side offered was potato--seriously? No pasta option in an Italian restaurant?) Our server said she would ask the chef to accommodate me but she'd have to charge me $12 for a kids spaghetti dinner! We went back and forth for a minute or two (I only wanted a half cup of plain spaghetti!) before my exasperated beau asked to speak to a manager who echoed our server in saying this request was basically out of their wheelhouse of deliverables. At that point i made a mental note to never return. And while the measly pasta portion was eventually grudgingly deliverered and I dutifully paid my 20 percent tip, I had already checked out.  I am not a demanding diva. I am polite and non-confrontational by nature. But the inflexibility and unprofessional service of this place has resulted in a loss of future business by this customer."}
{"text":"Each of our meals was delicious - light, fresh, and flavorful!  The tiramisu may be the best in the CLE!  The restaurant is small, but accommodated my mother's limited mobility!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the Lakewood restaurant scene! Had to park a bit far a way but well worth the walk. Had spaghetti con vongole (clams) which could top any, anywhere. The roasted cauliflower was perfect. Service was great. Small and noisy but with a happy vibe. Next time dessert. Too full tonight!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Can't wait to try every dish on the menu!! Highly recommend! I will say they have a small dining room which is great for small parties. And they do allow you to bring your own wine with a small corking fee!"}
{"text":"Eat dessert first! Great desserts and wonderful pasta. Service was a little less than stellar but the food made up for it.  Super cute, fresh and modern."}
{"text":"Yelp steered us wrong on this place. Staff is attentive and gelato is good. But the food itself does not seem like it's cooked there. It seems like they reheat frozen foods and frozen pastas. I could do better at home. For the price, it should be better. The arancini balls were the size of a golf ball but seemed to be microwaved and not deep fried. They were not crispy at all. The sauce tasted similar to Ragu or Prego, definitely not homemade. Probably never going back for the food. Maybe the gelato."}
{"text":"The name of this place suites the food and the atmosphere \"very well\". The staff are very attentive and personable.  It used to be an old house that has that cozy feel to it.  The food itself was delicious I definitely will be back to try more on the menu.  My friend and I both had the lasagna which the only think I would have liked on it would have been more sauce drizzled on it.   They also have a nice little gelato cooler tucked away into the back which I did not have room for but I will most certainly try the next time."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is not negative in the least bit. It's only currently 3 stars because my family and I strictly visited for their Gelato. If I had been reviewing based on them being an ice cream parlor, it would easily be higher. My wife and I plan on having a dinner date soon to have food, at which time I will adjust this to reflect that. 

With that said, let's begin. The place is small. Tiny even, nothing wrong with that because it seems that they may be a forgotten establishment. That doesn't mean that they weren't busy or that they didn't have anyone eating. It's quite opposite they were pretty much at full capacity. They're in what appears to be an old home, it definitely makes the experience more personal. I'd say there are at most 7 tables inside? The fragrance once you walk in is overwhelming (in a good way), but as I said, I'll basically add to this once I return to have dinner.

Their Gelato case in front of the kitchen has 16 flavors. A good range for a lot of different tasts. Vanilla pecan, Nutella, cookies and cream, the simple classics. This was my first time having gelato and if all (most) gelato is creamy and sweet like this. I may stop eating ice cream altogether. My son and I shared vanilla pecan. There was a great balance of cream and vanilla with just the right crunch when you scooped into some pecans. Anything my son enjoys I know is definitely tasty, and he couldn't get enough of the gelato. So up for the gelato. And as stated earlier, we will return for dinner soon."}
{"text":"What a great little Italian eatery! Went there with 6 and it was a little tight, but it didn't bother me. There is not a bad pasta dish on the menu! All of us ordered something different and we all got to try different things and it was all delicious! It is a must try in the Lakewood area, feels and taste like a home cooked meal!"}
{"text":"We wanted to find someplace new to try. We searched Yelp and found a couple on our way back to Port Clinton. This is the perfect little place if you like Italian! Everything thing we tried was excellent. This is a BYOB just to let you know. It is a little house that is very cozy! Probably not a place for a romantic dinner due to every table is always full :). It appears to be family owned & the whole family is there working together to make sure you have everything you need! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Two of us came to this restaurant on a Saturday night with the expectation we would have to wait. It is very small inside (about 10-15 tables) and they told us it would be about an hour but it ended up only being about 30-40 min. We started with the bruschetta, then ordered the gnocchi and tortellini, and finished with some gelato from their gelato bar. BYOB and great prices, will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This was absolutely the best Italian I have ever had. The atmosphere screams genuine and the food is delicious! There is limited seating but it's part of what made our experience great. It makes you feel like you're home for a holiday! We had the gnocchi and lasagna both were fantastic! There is a very nice selection of gelato! If you drive by it doesn't look like it's wheelchair friendly but they have an awesome lift on the side! It was the perfect ending to our Saturday night!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I decided to eat here on a Saturday night, after hearing good things. We were not disappointed to say the least! This has immediately become one of our top 10 restaurants.  

We started with the bruschetta and it was fresh and delicious. Then we ordered the Spaghetti al Frutto di Mare and the Penne e gamberi. Loved them both and we traded plates a couple times.  They were filling but light, and the seafood was so good in both dishes.  The pasta was cooked perfectly.

For dessert we shared amaretto gelato.  It was as amazing as the meals.  

The staff was friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere was homey and bright.   Just had a delightful time and we can't wait to go back. Stop in and help support this wonderful local establishment!"}
{"text":"It is so nice to see a good eatery like this open in Lakewood. The food is fantastic, the service is great, and the gelato will literally knock your socks off. We have eaten here 3 times and had gelato a bunch of times. I've never had better gelato in my life.  The flavors are constantly changing and every flavor I've tried has been excellent! One of my favorite things on the menu is the bruschetta is it super fresh and the bread is awesome! Check this place out asap! Also- the customer service is too notch, something so hard to find in businesses these days!"}
{"text":"This is THE cutest little Italian restaurant. Emphasis on little. There are only a few tables inside but if you get one, it's worth it! I live around the corner from this place and went on a whim with my hot date :) He ordered one of the flat bread pizzas and I had the lasagna...Gahhh the lasagna!!! So good. 

Important note: if you're into alcohol, it's BYOB. This is easy to do since my other fave little store, Simone's, is across the street. :) 

Oh, and did I mention that they have Gelato?"}
{"text":"What a quaint little gem this place is. We went for an early dinner and by 4:30 reservations were already coming in. We started with the bruschetta and it was incredibly fresh, simple and delicious. The gnnochi was amazing, as was the Penne Arrabbiata. They do not serve alcohol, but allow you to bring your own wine. I'll definitely do this next time! Lastly, the gelato selection is impressive and we got a few flavors to go. Check out Molto Bene, you won't be dissapointed"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great price point.  Love that you can bring your own wine. We (two of us) ate like pigs for under $100. Service was outstanding. Everything was super fresh. Must try place."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant. Food is excellent, entrees Ravioli Di Aragosta (lobster) and Gnocchi al Ragu Bolognese, both very good. Tasty sauces and al dense pasta and gnocchi.
We were there about 7:15 on a Saturday night and the restaurant, which seats about 30, was full with only two servers. Food was not overly delayed, but there was little attention to water refills and request for more bread. I hope they can ramp up their coverage to match the popularity of this new establishment. We'll come back soon and maybe have a chance to try something from the dessert menu!"}
{"text":"Appetizers were great!!!! Main courses not so much. Wife had the lasagne and it was on par with stouffers that's frozen. My meal the shrimp pasta was ok, not good but ok. 

Service not so much. Didn't get checked on to see if food was even good. And was told to not order something off the menu, the one item I wanted to try. 

Sad as it seems quite trendy. And they're decently quick about getting food out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious pizzas and gelato. We shared the margherita pizza which was delicious and huge for only $8. Every gelato we tried was delicious, and I appreciated that they were rich and indulgent without being overly sweet. The pasta entrees we tried were also very tasty - maybe a couple dollars more than a run-of-the-mill neighborhood Italian joint, but definitely a step up in quality as well. The menu is small but focused, centering on simple dishes that let the flavors of the ingredients shine through. I was excited to see many seafood options on the menu, which I look forward to sampling next time.

The place itself is also small but again that works in its favor. The interior is cozy and warm, a charming mix of an informal Italian osteria and an ice cream counter. It's bright and welcoming, as were the staff who seemed genuinely happy to have us (and less than an hour before closing, at that).

They're a great addition to Lakewood. They have a different (and I'd argue, a far more fun and approachable) take on simple Italian fare as compared with some of the other options in town."}
{"text":"We love the atmosphere, food quality and awesome service.  A very cozy and comfortable seating area in which to enjoy well-prepared italian dishes with very ample portions (two times dining here, two times leaving with tomorrow's lunch).  The service is friendly and efficient and we really enjoy the BYOB with a reasonable corkage fee."}
{"text":"New, cozy restaurant with classic Italian dishes plus gelato and espresso. It's also a BYOB restaurant, so you can bring a bottle of wine ($5 corkage fee). We really enjoyed the food, especially gelato for dessert! Service was a bit slow/hectic, but presumably they will work out those kinks soon."}
{"text":"Cute Italian eatery in Lakewood. Truly a gem. The food was delicious and the service was excellent--even the chef stopped by to ask how we liked the food."}
{"text":"Delicious . Simply delicious
Salad , bread , cioppino ,  and the molten chocolate with caramel sea salt gelato ... 

Very full and happy . 

Also, the atmosphere is amazing - very comfy . The waitresses/ hosts are attentive, yet they do not bug or linger ."}
{"text":"Wonderful (2nd) experience at Molto Bene. We came here a few months ago and had a wonderful meal with great service and decided to come back again. We just finished another delicious meal. Brought our cousin from Los Angeles who was impressed enough that he decided to bring a coworker again tomorrow! All 3 dishes (eggplant parmigiana, salmon with linguine/pomodoro sauce, and the pasta ragu) were delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauces were authentic and very  flavorful. We then had the raspberry cheesecake and the espresso with gelato. Both desserts were awesome and the espresso with vanilla gelato was especially flavorful. The service was outstanding and our waitress Jessica was delightful and pleasant. We will surely come again and bring other friends and family."}
{"text":"Called here to see if they could accommodate a party of 7 which they did at the drop of a hat. As soon as we arrived they were expecting us with a table ready. The service was exceptional and no one at our table had a bad dish, as we all tried different meals. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolutely stellar little place. It's in what looks like a former house converted into a restaurant. Started with complimentary warm foccacia and olive oil/balsamic.

We split an order of the bruschetta. Warm toasty bread, fresh tomato, EVOO, basil, garlic. Lovely. 

I had the pesto linguine special, topped with a large hunk of fresh Burrata. Extremely flavorful and you could tell the pasta wasn't dried.

Wife had the spaghetti al frutti del mar. Had a *lot* of fresh seafood, more than expected. Shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, scallops, white wine garlic sauce. Absolutely stupendous. I'm not often jealous of someone else's choice, and mine was VERY good, but I'm a little jealous.

Absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Very nice and intimate venue. Menu is big and has something for everybody. Gelato bar is awesome too. We tried a few apps, mains and the gelato an we're impressed. We had 5 in our group which was a tight fit as there are only a few tables in this restaurant, but the staff did everything to accommodate us and it was perfect. We will definitely be back for another visit to explore more of the menu....oh and it's BYOB which makes it that much better!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving Italian so we stopped in. Wow. Beautiful and small with very friendly staff and FANTASTIC food. My pizza was great and the lava cake was heavenly. We both definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent gnocchi and penne. The pomodoro sauce was quite good, and the prices were more than reasonable."}
{"text":"I am going to start by saying that we were here for our August Supper Club event and with 16 people I think we overwhelmed this new little restaurant who has a max of 30 seats. There is a shared parking lot with India Garden, but I know several of us had to circle around for street parking or park a block or so away. Inside was pretty warm, but again I think this might have been related to 16 of us snug at a table and the open kitchen nearby cooking non-stop. I just fanned myself with their menu and was okay (also note that I am always hot so it was probably just me that was the problem). 

When we sat down we were given bowls of firm pita bread and oil (I did not have any so I cannot comment). For food we got a variety of dishes from pizza, to chicken parm, to gnocchi, to seafood stew, to veggie lasagna, to carbonara. Food did seem to take some extra time and came out scattered so some people were eating while others had to wait longer. I think this was due to our large group size and their small kitchen plus other diner's needed to be taken care of as well. 

I did not care for my dish, the penne carbonara. It was oily and had burnt pancetta. The last time I ordered this dish it was fettuccini carbonara from Mia Bella and it was creamy and delicious. I think I was just expecting something else and did not find what I was served to be that good. (Also, I forgot to ask so I cannot confirm if the pasta is store bought or homemade). I ended up dumping the broth from my friends seafood stew onto my pasta to make it taste better. I went home full but unsatisfied. Like if you're gonna eat something \"bad\" like a plate full of pasta, you want it to be worth it. 

Now, I do want to say that they other dishes I tried were great! The Cioppino (seafood stew) was very tasty, so was the Gnocchi al Ragu Bolognese. I also had a bite of the eggplant parm and enjoyed that as well. I really think I just ordered the wrong thing and would have been much happier with one of their other dishes. We ended our meal with a scoop of their lovely gelato. The brie and fig wasn't for me, but the strawberry and chocolate was good. They have other flavors like lemon cream, espresso, and speculoos (cookie). 

Lastly, I want to mention the staff, absolutely wonderful! From the owner/cook to the young servers, they were all pleasant and you could tell they tried their best and wanted to please you. 

Overall while I don't think this is the best place for large groups, I do think it is perfect for a date night or max party of four. Inside is cozy with some Italian decor and you can bring in your own alcohol. You could even pop in just for a scoop of gelato! Also, please don't be deterred by the carbonara, they had plenty of other dishes that were tasty. I am going to go with a 3.5 star rating for now, but I can definitely see myself upgrading the rating once I give this place a second try!"}
{"text":"Simply excellent, very accommodating, my aunt, who is approaching 90 was welcomed at the door and helped out after our meal..The meals that we shared were made from scratch by the chef, who came out and introduced himself. They have been open for 3 weeks, and serve authentic Italian, no salt or seasoning needed..leave room for dessert!  We had creme brûlée and it was excellent!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place since it opened a few months ago. We were very pleased with our first experience here. My
Favorite part of our meal was the bruschetta. The waitress proceeded to tell us that it is made fresh daily! I could eat this every day! The pasta was delicious as well. Don't forget to try some gelato if you stop in. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You are really doing yourself a disservice if you do not try this place. It's a quaint little BYOB Italian eatery. The bread was crispy, yet fluffy. The sauce tasted authentic and the crostini appetizer had my boyfriend leaving the restaurant with a new love of smoked salmon. Lakewood's best kept secret!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and I'm a'ready a huge fan. You know how some new restaurants fail for a few months until they figure it all out? Well, not this place. I'd say that the staff alone is worth of high praise. Even though this is a small venue, I took a gamble and invited ten of my friends, and they were able to accommodate us. I'd recommend calling ahead for any party over six people.
The menu isn't too complicated which makes it easy to choose a dish. So far everything I've had has been delicious. My first two dishes were the Penne e gamberi and the Carbonara. Both were amazing but I really enjoyed the sauce of the gamberi just a bit more.If you like shrimp then this is the dish for you.
On my previous visit I learned that this is a BYOB place so the second time around I brought four bottles of wine for me and my friends, party ensued. I think the corking fee was $5. *PRO TIP - Simone's Beverage is literally across the street.You can grab beer or wine on your way in and make everyone else jealous.

Lakewood doesn't have many Italian dinning options, so let's be grateful that Olive Garden didn't move in and instead we have this unique little place. If you don't come for the sauce, then at least come for the gelato!"}
{"text":"Tried Molto Bene for the first time tonight - and was super impressed. 

The restaurant is really cute and tiny inside. All of the food was delicious. Highlights: everything tasted incredibly fresh and perfectly cooked. Seafood pastas were flavorful but light- with great texture: nothing overcooked. 

The desserts were amazing: biscotti flavored gelato- yum! Amaretto gelato- Extra YUM!!!! And the espresso was also really good- especially the biscotti cookies that came with it. Each of the desserts had the perfect amount of sweetness- not disgustingly sweet and also not lacking sweetness. It was absolutely perfect. I don't generally like cold desserts - but I'll be back regularly for this gelato and the biscotti."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group for our August Supper Club and had a wonderful time. To begin, Molto Bene is adorable. The decor is modern Italian and inviting, and the restaurant itself appears to be sitting in a former cottage-type building. The minute you walk in, you just get really good vibes. Oh, and if it matters to you: it's BYOB. Should you BYOB, there's also a small corking fee, so be ready for that.

Molto Bene has a wonderful, full Italian menu. I had the Cioppino, which is a seafood stew of clams, shrimp, mussels, scallops, and white fish. I'm a creature of habit and order this dish often around Cleveland, and can safely say this was the best Cioppino I've ever had in Ohio. The herbed tomato and wine broth was rich, decadent and full of flavor, and the minute it hit  my lips, I turned to my friend and said \"OMG.\" I legit ate every single bite. Drooling. They also have the standard pasta, chicken dishes, and anything you could ever want in an Italian restaurant, making it a great place for all ages and taste buds. The food feels authentic and well-prepared. The big highlight of Molto Bene though is the gelato bar-- is made fresh daily with the yummiest flavors. I had the brie with fig, which sounds gross, but was super delicious.

To note: Molto Bene is small, intimate, and romantic. We came here with a large group, but I probably wouldn't do this again. I felt terrible for the amount of stress it put on their small kitchen. It's definitely a cozy joint, and more suited for a date night or small family dinner. Also: it's really warm in there. Dress light. Overall, I left feeling really excited about this family-owned Italian gem and will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a cozy Italian eatery, with menu selections and quality that are hard to find in the area, in my opinion. I got the Margherita and Lasagna. The Lasagna was amazing -- exactly the taste I'd been searching for. All the ingredients were fresh and flavorful.  The Margherita was pretty good. I get Dewey's a lot, and it's nice to have an alternative, with quite a different flavor profile. Again, you can taste the quality of the ingredients.

I think if they evolved their pizza crust more they could deliver an insanely good Sicilian slice, like you'd find in NYC."}
{"text":"Best of the best! Molto Bene is the best home cookin, made with love, Italian food I've had in Cleveland. The staff is welcoming and the atmosphere is laid back. I've been here multiple times and had a great experience every visit. It's really nice to have a place to relax and enjoy great food, and of course the deliciously creamy gelato! Will definitely be making this a regular spot."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and amazing food. Not much else you can ask for. My table has the Gnocchi, Stuffed Rigatoni, and the Eggplant - all was exceptional. It's nice to finally have an Italian eatery where the food is light and fresh, instead of heavy and sad looking. Finished everything off with their Fig and Brie gelato - delicious."}
{"text":"New. Chic. Tiny space, classic flavors.  You walk in and everything is so fresh and new. The servers and kitchen are speaking Italian and the tables are full of people ready to dive into one of Lakewood's newest family owned establishments. We enjoyed the seafood di mare and the shrimp penne (better the second day). 

The service isn't as personal due to the team service they provide, but they have solid recommendations, arrived in a timely fashion and kept the drinks flowing. 

The tiny kitchen is impressive. We loved the house salad from here and I just am impressed by the fact they carry as much on their menu as they do. Definitely worth a stop, and welcome to Lakewood. 

Italian ice cream to finish is a must"}
{"text":"I love eating at local, lakewood restaurants, but I was somewhat disappointed in this new restaurant. 

First, it's BYOB/wine, just an FYI. We didn't see any alcohol on the menu and tried calling ahead to ask if it was bring your own but no one answered the phone both times we called. We ran across the street to Simone's after we arrived and confirmed that it was byob. 

We both started with a caesar salad. The lettuce was fresh, but the dressing was extremely watered down and bland. Not sure if they had just washed the lettuce and it hadn't yet dried? Also, I was expecting authentic, homemade croutons but these croutons were clearly from a bag/box of some sort.

I had the bruschetta as my meal and it was delicious.

My guy had the shrimp pasta in tomato and white wine sauce and said it was equally as bland and watery as the caesar salad dressing.

We finished with dessert: creme brûlée and tiramisu. Both were delicious! There selection of gelato all looked amazing as well! 

Long story short: skip dinner and go for dessert!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our first visit to Molto Bene! This new Italian restaurant adds a great west end addition to Lakewood.

The quaint small seating eatery offers authentic Italian fare including some traditional favorites like Lasagna, Chicken and Eggplant Parmesan, but also includes some chef inspired choices that will cause you to linger over the menu longer than you would expect.

Our dinner choices were spaghetti carbonara for me, which was probably one of the best I've had in years. My husband ordered a Pancetta and Arugula pizza and he loved every bite. 

We tried to order a molto salad to share but alas they were out. Considering we walked in 15-20 minutes before they closed we understood. They start every meal with a ciabatta pita style bread w/balsamic and olive oil dipping bowl. I would have preferred less olive oil as it was hard to draw the balsamic up onto the crusty bread.

We finished our meal with a cup of Gelato for me: they allow you 2 flavors in your cup so I chose Speculoos( a biscoff cookie filled Gelato and a strawberry filled with dark chocolate curls. Both were delicious together. My husband had lemon cake. 
Lemon cake with an almost torte like layer covered with a lemon mascarpone topping with mini white chocolate curls. The plate was adorned with a raspberry purée drizzle and fresh blueberries atop the cake. A nice fresh ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"Just opened! Stop by to get free gelato 4-7. The mango was amazing! Cute atmosphere but it seemed like they had the air off (little toasty inside). I will definitely be stopping back in to try some pizza!"}
{"text":"Wow! We went to Molto Bene this evening and were blown away. We had:

1) The pita/foccacia-type bread they serve before the meal. Holy perfect amount of salt and rosemary. Plus the accompanying olive oil/ balsamic was great.

2) Molto Bene salad. Great, cold salad with lovely peppers and olives. Yum.

3) Gnocchi with pomodoro sauce. Yum! Great texture and awesome red sauce.

4) Gelato. Do yourself a favor and order the speculoos gelato. If you like cookie butter, you'll LOVE this.

It was also very cute inside with a very nice and attentive staff. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Molto Bene is my new favorite Italian restaurant. Coming from a large Italian family, I'm pretty picky about my Italian food. After coming here for the Yelp August Supper Club, this place surpassed every expectation I had!

The restaurant itself is very small, it's actually inside of house/building. The decor inside though is very cute, and everything was super clean. There were 16 Yelpers who attended supper club, they even had a welcome sign for us! Our waitresses were all very kind and accommodating. The owner actually came out twice during our dinner to ask us how the food was, he was very friendly and kind! The waitresses brought out bread with a delicious olive oil to start. I ordered the veggie lasagna, and I think it was the best lasagna I've ever had, no joke. The sauce tasted exactly like the type my own grandmother makes. We also all received a free scoop of gelato for dessert. I tried the brie cheese and figs flavor and it was incredible! So delicious and creamy! All their flavors are homemade, and you can definitely taste the fresh ingredients.

I've already recommended this place to my parents and would recommend it to anyone else who loves Italian food. I'll definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Lovely dinner! Came tonight with my parents. We knew to arrive early (between 5/5:15). Table for three was available right away. Our waitress was wonderful, very sweet young lady (Gloriel), who was always attentive to what we needed and how we were enjoying the email. We ordered the bruschetta , which was delicious and I'm not even a tomato lover but I loved the way it was prepared. Our main entrees were the salmon pasta dish, the shrimp with penne, and the chicken Parmesan . All of them were delicious but I must say next time I'll order my moms dish (shrimp with penne) because the sauce was a mixture of my white creamy sauce and the red sauce, it was sooooo yummy! Highly recommend this restaurant and save room for their homemade gelato.... the very best! My dads dessert with the molten chocolate cake was sinful in the best way possible."}
{"text":"This was an interesting find. I got really excited about this restaurant because all the hype around the chef was amazing. 

However, they need a lot more work before they're going to be a good restaurant. My meal was scalding hot while my dads was freezing cold. It also took an hour for our food to come out. 

But they were very apologetic, gave us one of our meals for free, and gave us a free dessert. I really want for this place to do well but they have a lot of work to get there. I'd just go for the gelato for now."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for quite some time and finally went for dinner. It's a cute little joint perfect for dinner. We were sat at a table for 2 next to a window and enjoyed how clean and decorated the place was. The blue gray walls with yellow-gold accents went well together and paired nicely with the white dishes. We went to order a glass of wine and quickly found out it's BYOB. Bummer we didn't know but super excited to come back and bring some wine for next time.

We ordered mussels and Nonna's salad. The salads was super fresh and delish. Mussels were cooked perfectly and in a great red sauce. For dinner we both got the chicken parmigiana. The noodles were not overdone like most restaurants and the sauce wasn't overly sweet. Chicken was a pig portion and breaded evenly and crispy. There was ton of cheese on it- I personally would prefer a little less but I also am not a huge fan of cheese. 

For dessert we shared the Ferraro roche gelato. It was so creamy and good. All of the gelato we tried were great. 

Overall experience was really well and we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday lunch. All the food was very fresh and tasty. Also had some dessert which was amazing. The inside of the restaurant was also very cute and comfortable!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner!! I had the gnocchi bolognese which was delicious.  Serving size was a bit bigger than I needed but I have leftovers now which is cool.  Also, not sure why you would come to this restaurant and not get the gelato, it was perfect."}
{"text":"Do not let the 3 stars detour you. This place is really cute and cozy. The service was good and the gelato looks amazing. I'd say it is worth a try. I would not be opposed to going back and trying something different. If half stars were a thing Id give it a 3.5. 

So here's why the 3 stars:
Ordered the chicken Parm and Prosciutto pizza. The sauce on the pasta that came with the chicken Parm was tasty. The size of the portion of chicken was big. Unfortunately the chicken was dry and could of used more sauce and was kind of tough to cut through. I love Chicken Parm and was underwhelmed by it. The prosciutto pizza had a good taste but was a little greasy.

Willing to give it another try and try some different dishes. PS. it's BYOB."}
{"text":"A great Italian restaurant and it's on the west side!

We love the Italian food in Cleveland- however, we're pretty lazy about driving to the east side to get it. When we heard about Molto Bene opening in Lakewood, aka five minute drive from us, we were definitely intrigued.

It's a small restaurant- we stopped in late on a Friday night, found a parking spot (on the street, as their lot was full), and happened to get a table, after only a five minute wait. 

The waitress told us everything is homemade and we looked over the menu, already impressed. He ordered the Melanzane alla Parmigiana and I got the gnocchi. (I'm a sucker for gnocchi...)

Both came out with a nice presentation- and both were delicious. My gnocchi were soft and pillowy- my teeth just sunk into it just right. The sauce was excellent too- not too sour or sweet, but just right. His dish was also delicious- we felt like this restaurant should be in the Little Italy neighborhood..but whatever, we like that it's in Lakewood!

We were quite full- but decided to look at the dessert menu and chose the  semifreddo. (mostly, because we had no idea what a semifreddo was). It was absolutely delicious- almost like a mousse with a harder chocolate shell, and even an edible sugar flower on top. It was definitely rich, so we were glad we split it.

Overall, molto bene is a great addition to the Lakewood eateries, and it's a must go if you're craving Italian (and are too lazy to drive to the east side as well)."}
{"text":"We were pretty excited to try this place out.  We ordered take out...two order of chicken parm and the house salad.  We could not have been more disappointed.  The chicken was inedible because it was as hard as a rock. Even a knife could not cut through it. I had to spit it out.  

As a side note, the house salad was tiny for the price. A few pieces of lettuce, some tomato and cucumber.  Although I will say the dressing was tasty.  

We really wanted to love this place. Maybe they forgot to thaw the chicken tonight?"}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant! Great authentic Italian feel. Quick service and really good food. Glad I checked reviews because we didn't know it was BYOB, but with Simone's across the street grabbing a bottle of wine was easy! Rotating gelato selections which also is so good!"}
{"text":"Picked this cute little place for my birthday dinner from all the great reviews. We ordered rice and Asiago balls. They were good but don't think it's something i would order again. My daughter ordered the seafood meal. Hubby ordered chicken parmesan. Seafood dishes were tasty. I noticed hubby push his plate away. I asked him what was wrong because his plate looked delicious. He said chicken was disgusting tasted \"processed.\" I took a bite, and couldn't agree more. I don't know if they placed pieces of chicken in a food processor but the texture was awful. Sauce didn't have flavor. I told him to send it back but he refused. For dessert, I ordered the chocolate lava cake and expressing gelato, hubby ordered lemon cake but they were out. I wouldn't go back for dinner but I will go back for dessert."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant located in a small house. There are fewer than 20 tables. It has a very cozy atmosphere and it is BYOB (or GATSABI, read: go across the street and buy it). $5 corking fee. 

The house was full when we arrived, but we were able to be seated in about 25 minutes. We were offered water while we waited. 

Once seated, we chose an appetizer of baked cauliflower. It is just as it sounds, a simple, but well done dish. They were simply prepared with just some herbs and oil. They were cooked to tender and tasted great. It was a nice healthy start to the meal. 

There is a free offering a crispy, thin triangular pieces of bread. It is served with some oil, but I wasn't a big fan of it. The bread was too thin and crisp to truly dip in the oil. I guess if you want substantial bread, order one of the bread based appetizers. 

For my main I got the Penne Arrabbiata which is a simple penne pasta tossed with pomodoro sauce and red pepper flakes. The menu is full of seafood laden pastas that sounded really good. While I went basic with my order this staple sauce did not disappoint. It does have a kick to it. 

For dessert the gelato did not disappoint either. I loved the taste of the Brie and Fig gelato. The Tiramisu gelato tasted mostly like coffee to me, which makes me wonder how it differs from the Espresso gelato. 

I will come back here, but it will probably be just for gelato. This place needs to get on the radar of ice cream shop seekers."}
{"text":"Really Nice place! Food tasted homemade and the Gelato was amazing. Try the Brie and Fig!"}
{"text":"We went here spur of the moment tonight. We had them saved as a bookmark on yelp and I'm so glad we went tonight. The food was Outstanding. I wasn't aware that you could bring your own wine, so we will definitely do that next time. The portions are a great size and the gelato was the perfect way to end the meal. All the staff was very friendly, we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The three star review is mostly for the service. Food was ok, I would give it 3.5 with potential for 4, here's why...

SERVICE:
Yeesh, I don't even know where to start without being too lengthy.
There was 1 server for a completely full room. She was obviously overwhelmed because she was jogging around and walking quickly. I get it, but what I don't want to get is indigestion from watching you run past my table every 2 seconds. 

When I asked if they make their own pasta the waitress said yes and stared at me. Um, ok, so you're gnocci is homemade? I asked and she said no and stared at me. So, which ones are homemade? She didn't know. WHAAAAAT? Um, honey, you work at an Italian restaurant and you can't tell me what pasta is homemade? I ordered the chicken parm. When it came she set it down without saying anything, didn't ask if we needed anything else, and didn't come back to our table once until we flagged her down for the check.

FOOD:
They give you some crispy bread square things. My friend thought they tasted off, so did I, but we couldn't put our finger on it. 

Chicken Parm: Decent. The penne that came with it was typical, definitely not homemade, sauce was ok but not spectacular. The chicken would have been amazing if it wasn't for that same odd taste that accompanied the bread. And then it hit me. It tasted like old frying oil that hadn't been changed. 

PRICE: You get large portions but I still think they're overpriced.

CLIENTELE 
(this did not play a part in my rating since it's out of the restaurant's control):
I swear to you, there wasn't one person below the age of 55. It was groups of attention-seeking older couples trying to remain relevant by going to the hip new spot in Lakewood. Picture it: talking obnoxiously loud, drinking multiple bottles of wine (hence the loud talking and laughing for attention), dressing like they're teeny boppers, conversations revolving around them bragging about cars/kids/vacations/how awesome they are at life. Barf. 

My friend and I both agreed that we would go back to try the gelato, but not dinner, and the gelato will be 'to go.'"}
{"text":"Delicious. Meals were creative and fresh. Such a cute place. Will be back. Only \"complaint\": Two of us ordered the spaghetti with mussels. One had a plate with 4 unopened mussels."}
{"text":"So, so yummy! Awesome gelato and chocolate, and all of the entrees are to die for! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Such a very cute restaurant the food is AMAZING!!! The bruschetta is nothing short of fabulous and the pasta is so good!  Definitely a must if ur in the area!!! Staff is friendly and they serve gelato here too!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant with a large group 15-ish people. This is a huge group for this size place. That being said, the staff did a wonderful job of making sure dinner was a great experience for all of us who were dining. But, in the future I would recommend coming with a smaller group.
The food was very good. The sauce on the cioppino was perfect and the portion of seafood in the bowl was huge! The chicken lucchese had an AMAZING sauce and the chicken was perfectly cooked. 
Generally I don't love Italian food as I think it usually tastes the same everywhere.. but this stuff was expertly made and was actually delicious. I also really liked that the dining room was small and cute and I liked the atmosphere.
They also serve gelato - just as if you were in Italy. I had a small scoop of the Brie and Fig. Now, those are like two of my favorite flavors ever so I may be biased, but man, that was good. It reminded me of being in Roma. :)  I'd like to come back to try a few other things on the menu. 
Last, this place is BYOB which I did not know until after I got there and had dinner, but if you are smart, you will bring your own bottle of wine to enjoy with dinner."}
{"text":"Molto Bene just opened in Lakewood not long ago, right next to India Garden.  My girlfriend and I came here for dinner with a group of 16 Yelpers for supper club.  It's a pretty small place in a house-like building.  The place is really nicely decorated and clean.  

They had our table ready with a nice hand written welcome sign, which we all thought was a nice touch!  The complimentary flat bread with EVOO/balsamic for dipping was ok, but a few of the pieces were a bit charred for my liking.  Appetizers came out quickly and the servers filled our water glasses without having to ask.  They don't have a liquor license, but you can BYOB.  I wish I would've known that beforehand though.  With the building being very small, the kitchen is tiny with only 2 chefs, so it really took forever for our entrees to come out...I mean a long time.  The kitchen was clearly overwhelmed, but having grown up in the restaurant business, I know how that can be.

The servers were fantastic though and they apologized for the long wait a number of times.  I ordered the Eggplant Parm with a side salad and it was pretty good..I was starving, so I inhaled it pretty quickly.  My girlfriend ordered the Penne alla Carbonara and it was good, but I think I  could easily make that at home.  The head chef is from Italy and he came out to chat with the table afterwards.  I couldn't hear what he was saying, but he had a cool accent.

In addition to serving Italian fare, Molto Bene has a nice walkup  gelato counter with some amazing flavors!  I had the Espresso and it was magnifico!  When I'm in the Lakewood/Rocky River area, I'll be sure to stop in just for the gelato!  I'd come back to dine in with a smaller group and when it's less busy though.  I'll say, 3 stars for the dining experience and 1 extra for the amazing gelato!

Overall, I enjoyed my dinner there and hope the restaurant does well!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend!
I had the pleasure to stopped by Molto Bene few days ago. 
I had a wonderful experience. The food is super good, I'm Italian and the food tastes like in Italy.
I had gnocchi with ragù, the taste was just my mother's gnocchi. I could not get enough of it, even though the portion was huge, I had a great gelato dessert and a real Italian espresso coffee.
The owner, the chef and all the Staff, they love taking care of every single customer, and the environment is super nice.
For few hours I felt like being in Italy.
I really would like to recommend this restaurant/experience."}
