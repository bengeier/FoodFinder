{"text":"I ate a chicken salad sandwich today.  It would have been great until I chewed into some \"fat\" twice...yuk!!  that ruined it for me.  The prices are reasonable.  the sides are great.  Breakfast is unreasonably priced."}
{"text":"Amazing service ! Everyone greets you with a smile they treat you great. I ordered the breakfast sandwich on a croissant and plantains and it was very delicious. The cafe is also very clean, if you're in the area I highly recommend it. I loved it and if I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very nice owner.  He greets everyone coming in and out.  Food is decent. Menu is extensive.  There are plenty of seats in the cafeteria.  Can't beat the convenience."}
{"text":"This café is very convenient for the Charlotte East business park. The biggest advantage for business is to use the catering service. Martin, the owner, has extremely affordable prices. He is very kind on top of it. He always remembers my name when I eat there personally or order caterings for business meetings and events. I recommend any of the lunch specials, they are a big hit. There is ample seating across the hall and it is always very clean. Martin is also very flexible when it comes to adjusting your order for dietary restrictions. 

There are huge portion sizes. So there definitely is a great value in eating here. There is a nice coffee bar, soft drinks, baked goods, and candy as well. You can even order a smoothie or Frappuccino. The food is American and Italian but has a Costa Rican flare, as that is the owner's background. 

Check out Karmale Café and you will not be disappointed when it comes to convenience-if you work in the complex.. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

I would recommend the chicken fajita wrap and the chicken soup. However, I notice most patrons purchase the jerk chicken platter and quite enjoy it. 

The only criticism I have is that the food is not super fresh and there are no bold flavors."}
{"text":"Three stars may be a bit high for this place; maybe 2.5 stars is more accurate. 

I work in the area, and lets be honest and say that Albemarle Road is a wasteland for food choices. Seriously, no options beyond fast food or ethnic restaurants. Karmale Cafe is my only go-to option when I forget to pack my lunch. 

I've had the Italian hero, the chicken salad, and a breakfast sandwich. One of my co-workers likes the fiesta wrap, another likes the jerk chicken. All have been edible, but nothing to get overly excited over. 

I agree with the previous review about the prices, particularly when the quality of food is considered. The prices are on point with going to a Panera, but quality and freshness of ingredients does not match. 

One good point worth noting is that delivery is free if you work in the Charlotte East complex."}
