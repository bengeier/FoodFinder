{"text":"A hidden gem, Cafe Gasperi is my new favorite coffee shop. The whole place feels very European and has a modern color palette with cool chrome accents and an art gallery. The loft is an added touch. 
The selection is great and the beverages are the perfectly balanced, handcrafted quality you would expect to find in a boutique coffee shop. The baristas here have mastered the craft of coffee and continue to learn new skills it seems, based on my many visits here and the number of times I have seen the baristas being taught the fine subtleties in the art of coffee and the espresso skills that you would not find in an average coffee shop. 

I have been going here for a year now and will continue to go here to support the business. While they do run out of things at times and their menu seems to be an ambition in the works, this is something I'm willing to overlook because it is a relatively new shop still (only opened about a year ago) and it is a small, local business as opposed to a corporate owned coffee factory."}
{"text":"This place has the best cappuccinos this side of the Atlantic. I studied in Italy when I was in college, and cappuccinos here remind me of what I was accustomed to in Rome. One time, I had to wait a little while because they were making the croissants fresh for the morning. It was totally worth the wait. Everything is made fresh, and the quality is outstanding. Everything from the breakfast sandwiches, muffins and the croissants (my personal favorite) is second to none. I've always found the service to be friendly and helpful. Every time I come here, I have a good chat with whoever is serving me. Caffe Gasperi is a European-style cafe with small-town friendliness. It's great to have a local alternative to Starbucks and the other chain coffee shops. Hudson needed a place like this."}
{"text":"RUDE OWNER.  Won't be back.  Accused me of taking my tea when I never received it.
Spoke loudly in front of a crowded coffee house.  Only when she realized that I did not receive
the tea did she whisper sorry bout that.  Tea ended up being cold and tasteless.  :["}
{"text":"I love this place !! When you walk in you instantly feel like home! With friendly staff and wonderful decor it the place to go in Hudson, Oh for great coffee!"}
{"text":"Awesome café so chic, good coffee. Modern italian feel. Awesome hangout spot I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a place! Super classy, best coffee I've ever had, and WAY better prices of their specialty espressos than the pseudo versions at popular chains."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good coffee. However, I get the vibe that they're not quite sure what they're doing. I don't think the staff is trained in the art of coffee. They couldn't answer my questions clearly, I had to tell them how to make a drink (a London fog, something that all baristas should know how to make), and one time they had about 4 people smoking vape pens in the balcony and it completely stunk up the whole place. Not to mention it left a cloud of smoke long after they left. 

But like I said, it's a very low key coffee shop, perfect for reading for hours. Comfy couches, lovely decor, friendly staff. I know this shop hasn't been around for very long, so hopefully these problems get fixed soon! It doesn't keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"Consistently great drinks with consistently friendly service. The prices are reasonable and it's a nice local business, so avoid the gut rot from Starbucks and visit Cafe Gasperi right around the corner instead!"}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the atmosphere alone. I grew up in Hudson so was excited to find this hidden gem on my visit home. The first time I went it took over 15 min for a cappuccino & the worker seemed very nervous. So nervous he started making me anxious watching him! I decided to give the place another chance a couple days later. Again more then 15 minutes to make a cappuccino! When I finally got my drink after asking where it was it was not correct & they tried to fix it by scrapping the whip cream off & started adding things. I would strongly suggest getting a Starbucks barista in there to provide training on customer interactions and speedy/efficient coffee making. If they don't I seriously don't think this place will make it."}
{"text":"A sight for tired eyes! 

Beautiful European coffee oasis hidden just off the main roads of Hudson. Escape from the snowy mornings we've been having and get cozy in this new exquisite space. 

Love \"latte art\"? There's just something special about a pretty design in your foam to make you feel warm even before your first sip.

Appreciate a quality croissant? Choose from pretzel or classic, freshly baked.

Value a knowledgeable barista? Not only is the service smart and coffee savvy but they're also super sweet and patient.

Oh, and the prices? Less expensive than Starbucks. 

I am not a morning person, but Caffe Gasperi might just change that..."}
{"text":"Egg Sandwich with Avocado and Bacon was around $4. I felt this was a very good price as it is difficult to find something similar for the same price. Also, there was no additional charge for Gluten Free bread! Most places charge an extra $1 or so. They have gluten free options for a handful of their menu items.

Caffe Gasperi has a good cup of coffee. I ordered a decaf almond milk late. Unfortunately they ran out of unflavored soy/almond milk so it was made with vanilla flavored almond milk (silk brand).

The interior is quite fancy and there seems to be plenty of places to sit. It was also very comfortable and clean inside. The interior itself is a work of art.

Wifi was on the fritz when we were there. We decided to use the hotspot on a cell phone to browse the net.

Definitely worth a visit if you live near by. Otherwise, I would not make a special trip here just for coffee (I live in Lakewood though).

Overall I would give Caffe Gasperi 4 stars. They keep it clean, the employees are kind, the food was good (fresh, local baked goods), and the Coffee was coffee."}
{"text":"I really hate to give locally owned places bad reviews, but this place had more cons than pros. Location is difficult to find. There is no space to move in there and they're counters are extremely cluttered, which is not pleasing to look at while one waits for their drink. And they made my iced mocha with coffee instead of espresso. I might as well have ordered an iced coffee, since that is what it tasted like.. I have to say though, they're decor was very nice."}
{"text":"The phrase \"hidden gem\" gets thrown around a lot on Yelp, but one could make an argument this is one of the top hidden coffee house gems of the east side... and in Hudson! Who knew?

Whoever decorated this place knew what they were doing. The interior is small but packed with style. With tufted seating, wall-size sepia photographs, monogrammed pillows and chrome lighting fixtures, it's likely the most European-chic café in the suburbs. It feels super homey and comfortable. Pull me up a fancy chair and give me all the green tea! I loved my matcha green tea latte, which the barista brought to my table. 

If you're directionally challenged like me, plug this place in your GPS. When your GPS tells you you've arrived, be prepared to navigate to the back of a cluster of buildings that look similar.

Update: they no longer have a second floor, as some Yelpers previously report. Because of this, they simply have a downstairs, which has six tables. I loved the peace and quiet you can get here mid-day, but come 3pm+ it can get a little noisy. Be ready! But if organized chaos and miscellaneous chitter chatter doesn't bug you, than rock on with your coffee.  Or rock out to the awesome tunes they play. Really, I could hug whoever was spinning John Mayer's Where the Light Is: Live from Los Angeles. Extra points for awesome music."}
{"text":"The design of this place thrust out its slimy tentacles, caught my eye and pulled me in. That's was why I went there the first time, and the second time and the third time; if I ever go the third time. Back away from the road past some other businesses is the building with a sign, \"Caffe Gasperi Italian Coffee House\". Gasperi: ehh? Gas-berry? Italian: Italian? Yes Italian. DARK roast coffee. And possibly Italian style food. I once tried chocolate croissant which was good but a bit soggy; I'll blame the sogginess on the hour of the day. It had likely been sitting all day soaking up humidity. Walk up the gangway and through the door and you will be greeted by the Neo-Industrial, Rustic, Reclaimed, Victorian, Old Europe vibes. In a general sense, those styles wouldn't all go together but somehow these Gas-berry guys managed. My first visit was mostly spent running around like a chicken with its legs cut off, gawking and squawking at everything. I won't even try to describe it. Too much work+too long a review=not worth it. 

The coffee is horrible. As in one-star horrible. Espresso machine in use is a super-cool, Victorian style Elektra Belle Époque. But the coffee in use is apparently a super dark Italian roast. I tried a macchiato once. It was like drinking liquid charcoal. That had been soaking in dirty motor oil for a year. Then roasted in the stack of a redneck's diesel truck. Except worse. Normally after a statement like that, I would say that it wasn't actually that bad, but I'm not sure that can truthfully be said this time. Thankfully it's not so horrible when you mask the bitter burnt coffee flavor with more milk, like in a cappuccino. 

Hudson is a cool little town. It needed a brilliant coffee shop. Gasperi did that, except for the coffee part."}
{"text":"I actually don't think their drinks are that great. They make up for it in the atmosphere and friendly service though! Cute plush pillows, clean tables, nice wall art. Overall a very chill environment. It is also nice that they have their own parking, because parking in Hudson can get really difficult fast. I would be more than happy to come here again."}
{"text":"It's Saturday afternoon and you are a bit tired from Friday night... What do you do?? Stop for coffee of course! But where?   You can go for a big box store or you can support local business and stop here! 

You will not be disappointed! Cool hangout spot with comfy seating, good soft music, beautiful decor... And let's not forget the coffee.

The coffee is amazing.  My usual go to is an americano. I find that you can get the most taste of the beans and if the place can make it right (all you Americano drinkers know what I mean!) then I'm pretty sure the rest will be great for everyone else! And they definitely made it right! Quality beans brewed at just the right temp and poured perfectly! 

Come here if you want a nice local small town coffee shop for great coffee and a nice place to relax for a few. There is a small selection of sweet treats to compliment your coffee but the primary draw is definitely the drinks. Save the big box coffee for a day there is no other choice... Otherwise support local!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, however, the coffee is just ok and the workers were not the friendliest. When we asked questions about their drinks they were very short and rude with us."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and calm surroundings score a TEN on a scale of 1-5. The menu is limited but I am told it is expanding. The coffee rates better than its national competitor a 3 minute walk away. I don't think I could find a more fun local getaway--to read, pray, commune, knit. And the BEST part--you can make art here--they provide materials!  Not sure why it took me so long to get here--but now that I broke the ice, I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, friendly staf.  Will come back to try some of the food items.  Nice local shop - glad there is a solid contender to the local area coffee shops!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere. Cafe Gasperi exceeded my wildest expectation, in terms of atmosphere, service, and ambiance, of what a coffee house could be in Hudson, Ohio. 

Comfortable couches, seating, and even a loft. 

Coffee does not overpower you with boldness (like Starbucks does). Great cappuccino too.

Would definitely recommend to a friend, in fact, I already have. If you are looking for a place to spend a few hours reading or doing homework stop on by."}
