{"text":"Cava is one of those restaurants that unless you check a site like Yelp or have foodie friends that you will most likely miss. And to miss it would be such a terrible thing, given it is such a great little hidden gem.

Firstly the location, it's hidden off Yonge St. in a restaurant complex. My wife thought we had missed it while we were walking by, but go by the number (1560) and you should find it no problem.

Secondly, given it's not a *new* restaurant, it doesn't have all the new restaurant buzz associated with it. That's a shame, since this restaurant is doing something right to be full on a weeknight.

I made reservations given it was my wife's birthday, as she loves Latin/Spanish cuisine. The host called me the day of, and I mentioned it was her birthday and the fact that she was pregnant so any dessert would need to be safe for her (no un-pasteurized products). Arriving at the restaurant, we were seated at this great little corner table.

Now on to the food. Cava is one of the few places that serves sardines. I absolutely love these little critters, and the ones here didn't dissapoint. Given it's tapa, everything is sharing and the portions are pretty good. We ended up with one dish too many, but that was OK since my wife was eating for two, just like I normally do at a great restaurant! Dessert was fabulous, with a chocolate souffle which was out of this world.

And finally service was top-notch. From the front of the house to the waiters and servers. 

We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and service was spectacular. Our server surprised us with the tapas, and I must say the fois grais was delicious and so was the pickled sardines. 

The only down side was it was quite loud, as there was a lot of people in a small space."}
{"text":"it's a great place to have tapas. I always have special relish to those delicate small dishes since I left Spain. They employ several different spices to decorate the dish which make the dishes more tasty. I would like to give 4 stars to their food. 
The down side, which I would probably give 1-2 stars, is their service. As we stepped in, we have waited there for three mins while watching the manager talking with other person with noticing that we are there. Service is not great, but it is acceptable. However, when I ask my server if they could cut the birthday cake for my boyfriends, they said apathetically, OK, I have to charge you $5 per slice. Wow that sounds ridiculous. It's actually the first time I encounter such a problem in a restaurant, mostly people would say, \"happy birthday\" and cut the cake for you. But the server's first reaction was like: \"OK, I have to charge you $5 per slice since we don't allow any outside food.\" Then I choose not to eat the cake there, and server said, \"I'm sorry but this is a policy that all restaurants in Toronto takes.\" LMAO. That's literally news to me.  I can bear disinteresting service and charing me for celebrating birthday, but I cannot bear people say something to me that is not true."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing small plates.  Go with four people and you will definitely in for a winning night."}
{"text":"Hidden location on Yonge Street - it almost reminded me of a suburban restaurant in a plaza mall.
Lots of great food and if you don't know what to order, the staff will make suggestions for you.
Didn't have one bad dish and we ate a lot. It's all tapas style. Food was really good.
We had lots of wine too which was fantastic as well.
The only surprise at the end of the night was the bill. It is pricey - esp their wine (if you let them choose for you)! I live in Toronto and dine out often but this was one of the pricier places for 2 people.
The ambience is fairly casual but you could dress it up. 
Nice place but I would say it was too expensive for what it offered."}
{"text":"Cava has a very trendy ambience to it - simple decor, nice little touches that give a cultural reminder of what cuisine you're eating.

Service is stiff - I didn't find the waiters to be particularly friendly, warm, or inviting.  While immensely knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list, their attitude is kind of hoity-toity, rather than catering towards your needs.

The meal itself had its moments.  Overall, the food is good, but the price?  Not good value for the money.

Mmm-ness
Pinchos of artic char and avocado: simple, delicious.
Chipotle-caramel popcorn: very enjoyable with a little bit of heat.  A different type of popcorn kernel should be used though, as the caramel made the popcorn a little too sticky.
Pinchos of gamay-poached foie gras: also excellent.
Papas-fritas!  Oh I liked the saltiness and the rosemary on these delicious fries.  But then again - they're fries - and $7 for a small serving?
Kingfish ceviche: quite nice, light, done right!

On the fence
Grilled squid with fingerling potatoes: mmm.  Potatoes are quite nicely done, and the squid had a good charred flavour.  Tentacles a little overdone.
Beef tripe: meh... was not a fan.
Oysters with tomatillo salsa: Excellent choice for the oysters, but the salsa - completely unnecessary.

I liked the simplicity of the plating - however, when delivering fried items like the potato chips/papas fritas/popcorn, they afix a little holder which is offcentre on the table, and put a little paper cone into it.  Kind of unfortunate for the person who is sitting immediately in front of this device as it impedes their access to the other dishes!

Generally speaking, it is a nice idea to go and share a couple of different dishes with a friend or two, and try something new.  A worthwhile experience to give it a shot and see what you think."}
{"text":"Excellent tapas experience. Wonderful variety of small plates. Sufficiently complex and enjoyable flavored. Sable fish is a must. A little on the pricey side. But very creative menu."}
{"text":"The experience was overshadowed and tainted by not 1 but 2 rude waiters!

We elected to do the chef's tasting menu... With the caveat that we did not want any dish that contained raw fish.  A few dishes in a server brought ceviche.  When we reminded him of our request, we were rudely informed that ceviche is \"cooked\".  Shortly afterwards, the waiter who took our order came... And instead of apologizing, for the misunderstanding, insisted that that he didn't bring us anything raw!

When I pay $20 for each tiny tapas dishes, I expect to have a nice dining experience free of arrogance and attitude... especially when everyone knows that CEVICHE IS RAW!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem tucked away behind Bruno's Fine Foods, Cava is the best Tapas restaurant I've been to in the city. Sundays are bring your own wine (without being charged a corkage fee!). The menu is mouth watering!!!!!! You must try everything!
Always looking forward for a night at Cava; always."}
{"text":"Went to Cava to celebrate my 10 year anniversary.  When I booked on line, I requested a romantic table.  When they called to confirm my reservation they let me know that they had given us the often requested corner table which was the quietest and most romantic in the restaurant.  This left me very impressed.

We had seven different small dishes for dinner.  Almost all were great, with lots of flavour, and nice presentation on the plate.  Service was well paced, with just the right amount of time between dishes.  The only thing that I disliked was that it became quite warm before we had finished our meal, and it was actually uncomfortably warm, though they did keep our water glasses full."}
{"text":"Incredibly happy with this restaurant! Not only did I receive amazingly-excellent service, but the staff was incredibly fun to joke around with. And, of course, the food was great.

Overall - this was a highlight of my trip to Toronto and made a night out with my friends even better. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We ordered the \"trust us\". They made all of the choices from wine to 5 tapas plates to dessert. All were things we never would have chosen on our own -- and ALL were spectacular. Noise level was loud, but so worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal with perfect service. 
We joined another couple for dinner, late on a Friday night, and enjoyed some delicious tapas, wine and desserts. The restaurant was busy, and many if the people seemed to be regulars. 
Our main server was exceptional, very friendly and attentive, as were all the people we chatted with throughout the night. 
We tried 9 tapas plates - the highlights for me were the cerviche, sable fish and eggplant. And after decades of trying, somebody prepared brussels sprouts in a way that I enjoyed them! We finished the night sharing a plate of churros and delicious rooibos chai. 
Before tip the bill came to $250 for 4 people (9 Tapas, bottle of wine, shared dessert and tea)."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  relaxed - comfortable - unpretentious 
Wine list:  great pairing with food
Food:  outstanding - 
- fois gras;  was out of this world - perfectly cooked fois gras with a chutney that perfectly complimented the  richness of the fois gras
-charcuterie dish;  had amazing unique complex flavours - awesome
-eggplant dish; arrived at our table piping hot- considered it a  \" to die for  and gone to heavenly goodness\" -crispy,soft,bit of tartness from the tomatilla  rounded off with the creaminess of the cheese. Yum
Service: outstanding - very attentive and catered to your needs. 
Overall:  definitely would rtn."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a reason to try Cava for a little while now and I finally got one earlier this week. It was my and my fiancee's 8 year anniversary. So we thought we would give Cava a try. As far as the food and service were concerned, I don't think that we could have made a better choice. 

The menu is a traditional tapas for the most part. So we shared a variety of dishes (8 dishes in total). Everything that we tried was excellent, but two of them really stand out even a few days later. 

One of the first dishes that we tried was the swiss chard with pine nuts. This is not a dish that you would normally expect to stand out. But the simplicity and quality of this dish were evident. 

The second dish that my fiancee and I fought over (she won) was one of the two deserts we ordered. Unfortunately I don't remember the name of it, but it is basically a chocolate lava cake. This is a truly decadent desert.

The only negative about Cava, and the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars has nothing to do with food or service. The space that Cava is in doesn't suit the quality or price point of the food they serve. The interior of the restaurant looks more like a diner with good lighting than a restaurant of it's quality should. I was expecting more a hole in the wall that comes off as charming, cozy, and romantic. What I got looked more liked like a struggling restaurant in the suburbs than any of those things. 

Regardless of if you live in the St. Claire neighborhood or not, you should try Cava if you haven't yet. The food was outstanding and the service is spot on."}
{"text":"My friend was in this restaurant few weeks ago.. and shared with me his wonderful experiance. when we were sat for another dinner, we thought it will be a great opportunity for me to try it... and to be honest... we both wish we didnt. 

lets start with the service... throughout all the evening, the waiters were very stiff (and not in a good way), our requests were answered after minutes of wait... 

the food werent unique at all, and too pricy for those small portions. 

I think that the concept has a huge potential... but it isnt being realized."}
{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant for years and it has remained one of my favourites but recently they have gone above and beyond to make me feel comfortable which has motivated me to write a review.

I would not go if the food was not great....and I should clarify its not just great... its fantastic! It's the best of both worlds...comfortable (classics like a perfectly cooked piece of fish, paella or fries) but if you are an adventurous eater your pallet will be surprised every visit with new ingredients and flavour combinations (Ex. Salsa Verde/Eggplant with bonito flakes). 

But if a great meal is paired with bad service I would not go again...
Cava has the BEST service I have ever received at a restaurant. Everyone is very knowledgable, friendly and accommodating. Their isn't one staff member or service that is lacking. They define what fine dining should be."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! If you like spanish Tapas this place is a must or you. I feel like everything on their menu is incredible! the only downside I can say is that it is pricier than other tapas places. But hey, you pay for what you get!"}
{"text":"I would say they serve an unusual but good quality dinner. 
Paella was my favorite one :)"}
{"text":"Cava. Whenever I think of the times I've been there I always get this feeling of satisfaction because the meal was perfect. The service, the food (wowza) and the wine. Everything intertwined perfectly. Last time I went (June 2013) we didn't order ourselves but let the waiter guide us through 6 tapas that went well with the wine that we picked. Every bite was absolutely delicious. It really is amazing how they paired so many ingredients, but made the dishes so simple. 
Just go. Next time you want to try a delicious and intimate restaurant in Toronto, go here."}
{"text":"I took a date to Cava on a Thursday night and was extremely pleased with the environment and the food. The complex blends of flavours on each plate make for excellent discussion and for a satisfying experience.

The service staff is perhaps a little too obsequious, but they're also very knowledgeable and helpful for those who are new to the tapas experience.

For a place with such an abundant and interesting selection of wine, the lack of variety in beer is disappointing. Nonethless, overall a very satisfying meal.

My personal recommendation is to try the eggplant - it's a perfect blend of flavours and textures."}
{"text":"Sweetbreads! Foie! Pintxos! Cavaaaaaa!! What a horrible location for such a great restaurant. But who cares, you'll want to return again and again and will have a hard time restraining yourself while there!!"}
{"text":"IT'S SPECTACULAR. There was so many options....to lazy to decide...we did the chef's tasting menu. The dish comes pretty quickly which is awesome for someone who is starving! And, every dish was delicious. My favourite dish was the fois gras!

Cava was great. Service was great. Ambience was great. Overall, we had an awesome dining experience."}
{"text":"I have been craving for Spanish tapas after I came back to Toronto from Barcelona in May. After some research on Yelp, it looks like Cava's is the one I was looking for. I was correct and the meal was fabulous. I went with my girlfriend and we were trying to choose what to order and couldn't make up our mind. The server Jeff offered helped and after a while, we still couldn't make up our mind on what tapas to order. Jeff offered to choose the tapas for us. He ask us what we like and not like and said that he will choose around 6-7 tapas for us which will come to about $100. 

The meal was full of surprise since we do not know what are getting. We loved all the tapas (listed below). Jeff's service is also exceptional good (better then the service I get at canoe/bymark/O&B). For sure will visit again.

Here are the Tapas we had and remarks on each:

PINCHO OF GAMAY-POACHED FOIE GRAS WITH PLUM MOSTARDA -This must be the best foie gras I ever tasted. The foie gras is cooked just perfectly and melts in your mouth. the sweetness from the plum makes it taste even better. 

PINGUE PROSCUITTO - It's just typical prosciutto, nothing special and it can't compare to the once in Spain. 

SEARED SEA SCALLOPS WITH PIPIAN AND CAULIFLOWER - The scallop was crispy on the outside and so tender inside. The scallops are seared to just medium rare and you can taste the sweetness from the fresh scallops. I like the sauce a lot too. Highly recommended.

GRILLED SQUID AND FINGERLING POTATOES, GREEN ONIONS
AND ROMESCO - this is one of the best grilled squid I had in Canada. It's cooked just right so it doesn't taste like rubber like many other places and the sauce is excellent too.

EGGPLANT WITH QUESO FRESCO, HONEY AND TOMATILLO SAUCE - This dish was highly recommended by the server. It's very tasty. The eggplant is soft inside and crispy outside and if you eat it with the fresco queso, it's just awesome.

ROAST QUAIL FILLED WITH CHICKEN - I am not a big fan of quail but I liked this one. With the chicken stuffings, it tasted like turkey. =]

PAPAS FRITAS - I thought this would be similar to the patatas bravas I had in Spain but it's just normal fries with chipotle mayo. This one kind of disappointed me and not worth $7

FRESH CORN TAMAL WITH WILD MUSHROOMS AND PASILLA CHILE-WILD PLUM SAUCE - This tapas is very interesting and recommended. You must try it yourself to explain it."}
{"text":"Quality ingredients and a well chosen wine list. Nice room albeit in a funny little mall. Great place for entertaining over a lingering dinner."}
{"text":"We went here for a team dinner and opted for the 6 course menu suggested by the maitre'd ... everything was so delicious. Even the anchovies pincho (super gilda). Absolutely loved this place...highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Just opened recently.  Lots of options to customize.  I picked a grain bowl with saffron rice and lentils for base, falafel for protein (you can also choose lamb, meatballs, etc).  Then you can add dips like hummus or tzatiki, toppings (like Feta, tabbouleh, cucumber/tomatoes, olives) and finish with a dressing.  I was happy with the food and options.  Very healthy.  Loved the ginger lime tumeric drink.  The one letdown was the side pita...sort of like tasteless cardboard...not worth the calories.  

It sort of looked a lot like Yafo Kitchen...which I still prefer by a mile.  Yafo is a lot more elevated with the variety of sides and hand made laffa bread.  Cava is more like a healthy Mediterranean Chipotle, so it should still find its niche.

Staff was super friendly and helpful. 

Bottom line....I would definitely try again, especially when Park Road opens."}
{"text":"Great place! 100% for service, staff were absolutely amazing! Food was good! We had the paella which was a bit different from your standard seafood paella - made with duck, sea asapragus and squash

Great atmosphere too and although we ate at the bar it was very comfortable

My only complaint would be the size of the portions, very small! this place isnt cheap and thats okay but would be nicer to have a larger sized portions"}
{"text":"I got the grains and Green's combo with super Green's.  Consisted of mixed greens brussel sprouts and some other herbs with lots to choose from. You get one greens, one grains,  one protein and unlimited amount of toppings. You also get three sauces to choose from and one salad dressing. It was a lot to choose but it was delicious yet light. It was a mix between a Chipotle Style  and Viva Chicken.  It caters to vegetarian and also meat lovers. I went around 12:30 and had about 20 people in line. Took about 10 minutes to get to the counter to start my entree. Would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant. Love the tapas concept. Plenty of options for the meat and non-meat lovers alike. Wine list is select but well thought out. Wine pairings were perfect. 
The main selling point is the service, which is attentive to a fault. Very serious about their food but knowledgeable and relaxed in their approach. It was even easy to bring my three year old. The liver/foie gras pate was a hit with her. My favorite remains the eggplant."}
{"text":"Good food, healthy. They also have a diaper  change table for kids which is a plus .
Great location"}
{"text":"The service was great. The food was average. Very clean in the inside and the mangers kept checking in with me to see how my experience was going. Worth giving another try and trying out a different dish."}
{"text":"would have walked right by this place if we weren't looking for it. but it was so worth the find! the entire experience was wonderful and completely made our night. nice atmosphere, exceptional service, and most importantly amazing food!!! of what we tried, the eggplant, brussel sprouts and foie gras were so delicious, we still drool a little when we think of it. quail was the only dish we didn't go crazy for. great spot for a romantic dinner or a fun group meal."}
{"text":"It had to be one of the best meals that I have eaten in a while. All of the dishes were composed well and thought out. Everything from the broken china to the jamon slicing station has a place. Kyle and Jeffery were on point with all the recommendations.  Will be back but will want a little bit larger table. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Nice small plates.  Wine was fantastic.

Super expensive though.  Tapas tends to be expensive, but this is near the top end of the range.  We had a great dinner, but about average for the price."}
{"text":"In all honesty if I was reviewing this restaurant BEFORE the Black Hoof had opened, it might have been bumped up a star despite the fact that there are not an overabundance of similarities of style, but only because of the lack of items like Sweetbreads, Jamon Iberico, and creative charcuterie like dishes in the city. This is no longer a problem Toronto has, and the last time I went here, my appreciation/tolerance had faded. Cava is still a good restaurant, it has a varied and interesting selection of Tapas plates, with many of the best focused on seafood (the two sardines is great, the octopus is meh). It has a great wine menu and at least one (Tyler) great and knowledgeable sommelier/server. The only problem is that none of this has ever added up for me to a completely satisfying meal. I usually have at least one really goo dish here (lamb is great), one very dissapointing one (sweetbreads were badly matched to their sauce and compared to the unbelievable ones I had tried at Black hoof the week before were  just boring) and the rest will be...well, I don't remember the rest.

So: Cava is not bad, and I am sure it is *possible* to have a great meal here, if you luck out on the right choices, but it is far from guaranteed, and there are too many missteps for me to spend any more time or money here."}
{"text":"Ok so i been on a KETO diet for 4 months now and its really hard to find good food that i can have with this diet and not fan of salad... i know!!! But these salads are the best!!! This place is awesome and you can order with app and your order is complete in minutes!!! CAVA people are awesome. Definitely great place for lunch, dinner and snack time. Come try them out if your into Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"We made a reservation at this restaurant for our first anniversary, after choosing to to eat Spanish in commemoration of our honeymoon in Barcelona. When we arrived we were immediately greeted warmly, seated in a corner table, and were treated with so much attention and respect for the rest of the night.  The owner or manager came over fairly early, and walked us through the menu, providing us with his suggestions. The waiter who served us was also incredibly knowledgeable, and we decided to take advantage of their half-off a bottle of wine offer, and enjoyed a gorgeous bottle of cava. We also decided to let them \"cook for us\", and were so glad that we did. All of the courses that were served to us were stunning, and it took us right back to Spain. We haven't stopped raving about our meal there since we left, and plan to bring in our friends soon! Thank you for making our first anniversary feel so special!"}
{"text":"Tapa style restaurant, for us it usually takes 5 dishes to be full.  I.e. it is pricey, but one has to pay for quality.  Each dish is a work of art -- very creative and flavours fit together so that the dish is more than the sum of its parts.  Great combination of flavours, definitely a place for a foodie.  Desserts are to die for and the wine menu is good -- mostly Spanish wines.   Its one of the few restaurants which allows you to bring your own wine which is AMAZING for special occasions.    On Sundays the corckage fee is half price which helps."}
{"text":"Love Cava. Even with a long line it moves quickly and you can skip the line entirely and order through their app. The braised lamb is my favorite."}
{"text":"So I recommended Cava to friends of mine, a couple, who rarely get to go out together coz their kids are little. So this was their special night out and Cava treated them very well. My friends who have eaten out a lot at fancy places in Miami, Orleans, London etc. thought it was pricey, but claim this was one of their best meals and dining experiences ever.....needless to say Cava turned things up a notch or two on their special date night ;)

I do feel Cava is TO best overpriced resto, way over priced, but good food, nice selection of vino, unpretentious friendly service and a charming ambience."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. Several friends have told me how good it is so I thought I'd try it. I am SO impressed!! I ordered a \"bowl\". Every single item available is remarkably fresh! My bowl consists of Arugula, brown rice, lentils, several sauces, quinoa, feta, tomato salad and more! The staff... all 4 employees that served me were incredibly friendly and helpful! The flavor of my meal is delicious!! Oh yeah... I also forfeited a side of roasted vegetables... they are Delicious!! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day as my dad requested a place that had Paella on the menu. The ambiance is very classy and the servers are very professional. We ordered the oyster mushrooms, shrimp ceviche, octopus adobo and the paella. The turnaround time was good with each dish coming right after we completed the previous dish with the exception of the paella (takes a longer time to prepare). For dessert we decided to share the pistachio cake.

1) Oyster Mushroom - Very well cooked mushrooms with a delicious garlic sauce.
2) Shrimp Ceviche - Good amount of shrimp and good contrast between the seafood flavour and tang from the lime juices.
3) Octopus - Extremely tender octopus with an equally delicious potato pancake.
4) Paella - Large portion with a variety of proteins including chicken hears, escargots, clams and chorizo. Only aspect I would change is to cut down on the salt levels.
5) Pistachio Cake - Moist slice of cake with just the right level of sweetness.

Overall, a very good Spanish tapas restaurant and would come back again for another special occassion."}
{"text":"Cava is a Spanish sparkling wine, and a sparkling Spanish restaurant on Yonge Street. 
The appetizer-sized portions are often a barrier for me to actually be full at the end of the meal. When I finished my meal at Cava, I was actually full. There were so many options to choose from, but my favorites were: 
Ceviche with chips, 
One bite pickled sardine, pickle, and pepper. 
Eggplant, 
Miso black cod, 
and others... 
It finally hit me that this is the purpose of small plates/tapas- that you can try a lot of different things without getting too full of one item. 
I still wish you could spend a reasonable about of money to get all the different tastes... 
The sommelier is a bit overbearing and then we had long periods of time without any wine after finishing our first bottle. 
So, lots of choices, good wine, but still hard to swallow the costs and service could have been better."}
{"text":"Overhyped and overpriced
Food was meh
Iberco ham was not belleto as I expected at $30 a serving
Just another trendy spot"}
{"text":"It's impossible to notice just by droving by, but the place a hidden gem tucked away.  The service is fantastic, they take your coats for you as you enter, answer all questions with great description and are quick to top off you water!  We came here for a bday celebration and were forced into a fixed price menu due to the large size of our group.  I was disappointed at first because it meant I could not get to choose the great menu items I've been reading about.  H

owever, after getting served so many delicious tapas plates, I came away a happy camper.  I lost track of how many sharing plates we got and was full at the end.  I haven't been to many tapas places before so I'm not familiar with what's normal, but but every plate was an interesting delight to discover.  I should add that the churros here are fantastic!  The chocolate/coffee dip it comes is heavenly."}
{"text":"Gave Cava four stars for the food only -- great selection of interesting tapas -- all very yummy!  Standouts were the goat cheese croquettes, the eggplant and the foie gras.  Also, who would have thought that some simple greens with fried chickpeas could taste so good.  The maple mousse with chestnuts was terrific, although more like a creme than a mousse.  Delicious!

Unfortunately, service was one star.  The tandem team of two guys that served our table had ZERO personality; cold and aloof.  One guy didn't seem to know anything about the dishes.  Pacing of the meal was way off as well.  We had to chug our bottle of wine as all the dishes came out within minutes of each other.  After finishing everything, we were left to sit for about 20 minutes before we could flag someone down to get our check.

Despite the lackluster service, the food is definitely worth a return trip.  Will try sitting at the bar next time to see if service is better.  Dinner for two with dessert, tax & tip was around $225 (including a $90 bottle of wine)."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and tasted great but portions for the price is why I had to give it 3 stars. I know it's a tapas and small plates restaurant but it was just way too pricey for a few bites each plate. Walked away feeling hungry and spent over $40"}
{"text":"Believe the hype.

This place is good, damn good.  Casual dinning without being hovered on by servers and having to tip.  Plenty of diversity and fresh options.  I am truly a fan.

All kinds of food options.  Multiple meats, including lamb.  Veggie options as well.  You can have it any way you want it.  On a pita, on a salad, whatever.  Then toppings such as pico and similar.  All kinds of amazing sauces, especially the green sauce.  On top of all that some pretty great flavored teas.

I'll be back and I'm bringing friends.

One side note.  The line moves fast.  If you are bringing grandma, please talk to her about what she might order ahead of time, maybe even look into the menu.  It seems to be a lot for the older people to comprehend."}
{"text":"This place is so good and fresh! A little pricey but it's worth it. They walk you through the process of making your meal without an attitude!"}
{"text":"Love love love!! So many options to choose from. Sort of like chipotle but Mediterranean"}
{"text":"This is place is so healthy and magnificent. There meals are have never disappointed me and I love this place so much. I have been here like three time and each time I have loved it more. I can't wait to go back and get some more. I don't think this place can disappoint anyone!!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding.  If you don't mind spending for a great evening I would highly suggest letting the server take over.  Our sever and all of the additional service staff were wonderful.  The food was cooked to perfection.  The sable fish and octopus blew us away.  One of the service staff also overheard us mention it was our anniversary and they brought us out a \"happy anniversary\" chocolate treat.  It was a beautiful touch.  We are one hundred percent coming back to try the sherry flight and have some more sardines!"}
{"text":"Definitely a cava fan and so glad we have one here in north charlotte! I love the healthy options and ability to customize your own bowls. The dressings are delicious ( tahini and spicy apricot and harissa are my favorites). I love the supergreens mix as well. The falafals are surprisingly tasty and hold together well. I've had dry falafels before and these are so much better! I love the app and ordering ahead of time so I can skip the line at the restaurant. They have both indoor and covered outdoor porch seating as well!"}
{"text":"We were at Cava to celebrate my birthday and I absolutely loved it! It is not really an authentic Spanish food, I would rather call it an \"artistic impression\" of Spanish cuisine, but all tapas that we tried were fantastic. I especially loved shrimp ceviche and chicken and foie gras mousse. My dad had paella with seafood and it was delicious too. The service was impeccable, our server was very polite and friendly. We will certainly come back to this place, it's not cheap but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Heard some great reviews and had to check it out. Comparable to chipotle or chopt. This place is good for the health conscious. I was impressed with the cleanliness and over all atmosphere.  Music was good.  Good customer service! Ill be back!"}
{"text":"Cava still rocks my world. A few weeks ago my husband picked me up from the airport (after a week long crazy trip) and took me to Cava for dinner. I am always scared to return to a favorite restaurant as I have bee disappointed several times before (Grace is a case in point). But we loved Cava just as much - the eggplant dish was just as amazing, the calamari rocked. loved the ceviche and were bowled over by the slow cooked cheeks. The peanut butter ice cream was a fantastic end and I even picked up some chocolate bacon toffee brittle from Xococava next door. Love it."}
{"text":"Excellent, hidden gem. Everything we've ever had is excellent. Super wait staff."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm in love! Walked in and was greeted by smiling, happy faces and they were more than helpful since I told them it was my first time. I got a bowl with greens and grains (black lentils!!) as the base and I chose falafel and braised lamb as my proteins. That braised lamb, though! After all was said and done, I had a bowl filled (like, filled) with amazing flavors and a delicious watermelon mint beverage to wash it all down. Bri, the manager came around to the tables and struck up a conversation with me. She was genuine and you could tell that she loves her job and where she works. They are lucky to have her! Every time I'm back in Charlotte, I will be back to Cava. Can't wait until there's one in my hometown of St. Louis."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I'm so glad they are here! The flavors are bold like I like. I have had the falafel and beef. Both were amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was so good I will definitely be going back! It's the best mixture of delicious Mediterranean flavors done your way!"}
{"text":"Went on opening day and the food and juice was amazing. I did the create your own salad and grain bowl and the hummus, crazy feta, chicken and it was amazing. Everything was fresh definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"FINALLY CAVA COMES TO HUNTERSVILLE! This place is great - like Chipotle for Mediterranean food. Portions are good, and everything is fresh and of good quality. Their drink selection is unbeatable! 

Not exactly stroller-friendly, which is a major bummer in a place like Birkdale. 

Online ordering is a must!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off night.
But after checking this place out last week (with semi-high expectations), I now refer to it as \"Torito without the charm\"... 
Coming from the west end, there is no way I'll go back.  For what?  

The staff is arrogant.  Asked for an extra plate of bread, got the response: \"we do not normally do bread service\"...... what exactly is bread service?

Unlike Torito, the menu is frustratingly inflexible.  We (group of 6) pretty well ordered the entire menu.  But in the process if there was a dish that came with 5 pieces, there was NO WAY our waiter could ask the chef to serve the dish with 6 pieces - we had to order 2 dishes.

To perfectly top off an evening made awkward by our pushy waiter, we were presented with the bill which already included 18% gratuity.  
In the mood for (better) Spanish food?  Kensington here we come!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the \"fast casual\" dining scene. I am a vegetarian, so quick healthy meals can be hard to come by. I personally love the falafel. I would prefer having a menu with certain staples though, as the first time I went it was overwhelming to chose from the long list of ingredients, some of which wouldn't have tasted great together. I also recommend eating the food there, as I have done take out before, and by the time I got it home it was pretty soggy."}
{"text":"Greek version of Chipotle. Great quality, a little too expensive. Compared to showmars they get a 4 star. I highly recommend u try this place if u enjoy eating at chipotle."}
{"text":"The setup is like Chipotle. You go down the line and they ask you what you want and you build it as you go along. 

I had the salad with the supergreens. They told me I could have three dips. But why tho? I just didn't get the purpose of the dips when you were still going to get dressing, and why three? Will they all work together? So many decisions. I opted for the tzatziki, harissa, and eggplant, but on the side. I wanted the roasted veggies but they didn't have any ready, so I opted for the falafel. I had them put on the tomatoes with onions on there as well. Then I had the lime tahini dressing on the side.

So how did everything taste? The harissa paste is super spicy, it deserves the two pepper rating. Use it sparingly. The tzatziki was good, because it always is, on anything. So I put some of that in there and mixed it in and a little of the tahini dressing. I used the eggplant dip a little at a time while eating. Overall, I think when I go back, I'll get two servings of the tzatziki dip and one of the eggplant, and one of the tahini or two, if they allow it. The next time I'll just dump them all in there and mix it up. Although I hope to try the roasted veggies, the falafel had a really nice flavor."}
{"text":"I went to Cava last night with my family. I was really looking forward to it after reading so many great reviews. The room was full, but the noise level never got too high. The service was slow to start out, but then got better as the night progressed. We ordered 2 bottles of wine our waiter suggested. Both were excellent. 

Okay now on the food. We had:

Pincho of avocado and avruda - 5/5 so good!

Pincho of fois gras - 5/5 get this!

Grilled octopus - 2/5 this is a share size for 2 people, not 4. Also, it wasn't fresh. Octopus was way too chewy. The only reason we ate it is because it came out first and we were STARVING. If we weren't so hungry I would have sent this back. 

Eggplant - 3/5 This is delicious, but it is deep fried. So if you were hoping for a healthy vegetable dish, this is not it. It would have been nice if the menu gave a more accurate description. 

Duck breast - 5/5 This was incredible. I loved the fennel ravioli it came on. This is a share size if everyone is okay to have 2 pieces of duck and a mouthful of fennel. We ordered 2. 

Beet salad - 5/5

Sable fish - 4/5 This was delicious, but not at all a share size. This was the size of most appetizers. I can't imagine why this would be $30. We were really surprised when the side plate with the tiny piece of fish was brought out. 

Tagiine of lamb - 4/4 very tasty. 

clams with chorizo - 2/5 I thought the sausage was really good, but then came home feeling awful from too much salt. I would skip this one. 

Venison anticucho - 3/5 too salty for my taste. The cabbage it came with was very good. 

Dessert: 

Churros - 4/5 - They were better without the chocolate sauce.

Some sort of banana tart with buttermilk ice cream - 3/5 The tart was heavenly, IMO buttermilk ice cream should not exist. -2 stars because of it.

Also, one of the diners in my group had several food allergies, and Cava accommodated us beautifully. They even brought out a sorbet for him when the desert came (which we didn't order),  so he could have something uncontaminated by his allergens. Thank you Cava :)"}
{"text":"Chris the manager was awesome! I wasn't sure if I was going to eat there since it was my first time but I'm so glad I stopped in. Food was great, staff was great & he was right, I will be back !"}
{"text":"Cava is probably one of my favourite restaurants in the city. The food is fantastic, the service is always attentive, informative and truly helpful when choosing from their varied Spanish tapas and larger plates.

Although I live downtown, I'm never opposed to a trip North, where I can avoid the hipsters and lineups. Making reservations is simple on Open Table and I've never had to wait for my table upon arrival. It's a great place to bring family or a mid-size group for a special occasion and equally befitting for a romantic dinner. It can get a little pricey, depending on what you order, but I always feel I've received my money's worth.

Papas Bravas, french fries seasoned in rosemary and sea salt arrive in a paper cone and are so good that we even clean up the tiny crispy bits.

Gamay Poached Foie Gras is on the smaller side, but it's just enough for a taste without being too rich. Salt Cod Cakes are lightly crisped on the outside and almost creamy on the inside. Sweetbreads are a favourite of mine and I'm never disappointed with the way they do them here. Poblano chilies are mildly spicy and a nice backdrop.

I never miss the Fresh Corn Tamal with Wild Mushrooms and Pasilla Chile Sauce. It's a delicate bundle of flavour heaven wrapped in a corn husk.

Charcuterie is also a must here.

Cava makes all their own desserts so although I'm not a dessert freak, I always try some of their truffles. The last time I was here, the waiter recommended the Chocolate and Cheese pairing, since I wanted something savoury and my friend wanted sweet. The combinations were explosive and unexpected. Needless to say we were very happy.

You can also ask them to cook for you and the kitchen will select a bunch of amazing things from or off of the menu and the server will bring out each mouthwatering dish and describe it in detail. I've done this and it builds the anticipation--- not knowing what dish will appear next and in what order.

Cava wins on all counts. Working in the industry myself, for over 20 years, I can see when things are running well. The fact that there is little staff turnover and everyone is so good at their jobs, makes the amazing food here taste even better.

Well done, Cava!!"}
{"text":"Great delish fast healthy food. I'm hoping more locations open up in Charlotte. I had a falafel bowl and my husband had the spicy lamb meatballs pita. Both were very good. I'm not sure i could order anything we wouldn't like."}
{"text":"I. LOVED. IT!!!! Very similar to Yafo- a favorite that is too far from me. I was counting down the days until this place opened. It did not disappoint. Everything was yummy!!! A new restaurant is now on my belly's list of favorites."}
{"text":"Loved it! It was my first time, so I'm still working out my sauce, protein, vegetable combination....but it will be fun figuring it out!"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean style food that comes at being very customizable as well as having a great price point! The generous portions let you fill your bowl with variety allowing you to get different tastes and flavors. The modern aesthetic of the restaurant adds to the appeal. Definitely recommend the grain bowl with the pita- be willing to branch out from what you might usually select and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly service, great portions. It was my first time and I surely will be returning!! I had lamb meatballs and they were delicious. As well as the superfood salad bowl I had. I didn't try any of the juices but they all looked and sounded wonderful! I am excited they are adding one to the birkdale area."}
{"text":"Awesome place for Spanish food. Not Spanish portions or Spanish prices, an okay substitute for the authentic across the pond. The foie gras, both mousse and the gamay-poached, were delicious. The gamay-poached had a sweet flavour, while the mousse melted in your mouth had the traditional foie gras taste. The charred octopus with mojo picon was tender and not chewy. The duck breast with pipian rojo was cooked to perfection and tender. The reason I give 4 stars and not the complete 5 was due to the Iberico ham which was dry and tough and the flavour dried up. Having had the authentic in Spain this was a significant disappointment and not worth the price. The sangria we ordered was weak and lacking in flavour. I've had better elsewhere in the city. But the service was awesome, could not find fault."}
{"text":"Cava never dissappoints. 

I came here again this past Saturday night and it was SO good. I definitely got some of the same dishes as last time which included the chipotle popcorn, ceviche, pappas fritas, avocado app, veal kebob, the charcuterie board, beet salad, edamame bruscheta and the lemon curd desert with thyme....

My FAVORITE thing on the menu is definitely the charcuterie board becuase it comes with the chicken liver mousse which is OUT OF THIS WORLD. You get a pretty good chunk along with the other spiced salamies. It is divine. I also love the pappas fritas, yes I am a sucker for frites. The popcorn has that perfect mix of spicy and sweet. 

Our service was impeccable. The waiter was really attentive and helpful.One of the best tapas in Toronto for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This is the third or so time I have been here and my second review after about two year gap. They have managed to keep the standards to a very high level, and make it a wonderful place to have an unusual and high-quality dinner.

We went with the tasting dinner, and had no idea what dish would follow next.

We had ceviche to start, not usually one of my favourite dishes but in this case it was outstanding. It was not too sharp, full of different flavours with avocado and onion and snapper. It went extremely well with the Fino Sherry that we were drinking.
We were then brought tapas, (pinchas?), one of foie gras which was outstanding again, it had a sweet fragrant wine topping and went well with the Champan we were drinking. The other was sardines on pan con tomate with anchovies and olives as a garnish, it was also wonderful. We could easily have stopped here, but we didn't!
The next was a combination I would never have imagined - squid with fresh peas. It worked really well, there was Jamon in the pea sauce and oyster mushrooms to complement the squid.
Apparently one of their classic dishes is  fried Japanese eggplant, with cheese and mildly spicy, tomatillo sauce with flakes of tuna belly on top. Very interesting textures and juxtapositions for the pallet to enjoy.
Next was venison with red cabbage, a much lighter dish than it sounds and superb.
This was followed by sweetbreads, again not something I would normally eat, it was lightly fried and simply outstanding.
We had really had enough by then, but we had a beautiful palate cleansing lemon desert to finish us off!

The wine list is extensive, with many good Spanish wines on offer.

The service was beautifully balanced between being informed and interesting and yet not intrusive.

The locale is unprepossessing, but nevertheless suitable.

Well worthwhile for a special occasion."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! The best part was the employees. I felt kind of stupid and almost like a pest for asking so many questions because I didn't know there was a menu that literally walked me through the whole experience. The employees were so patient and so friendly. I apologized for all of my questions and they were so helpful and knowledgeable. Cudos to Cava for the training they must've done with them. Super impressed with everything from food to service. We've already been twice in 1 week and I can't wait to go back again. I work at a restaurant so you know it's good if I sacrifice business to tell my guests about an amazing new place!!!"}
{"text":"This little Spanish restuarant is tucked inside a small plaza a block north of Yonge/St Clair. The atmosphere is quite intimate.

The apps or pinchos were small packets of disinct flavors. The supergilda was a savoury sardine-based pincho that opened your appetite for the upcoming courses. The croqueta of jamon was a bit too creamy for me, but I can see how someone would prefer that.

The red fife wheatberry salad tasted fresh, but it was drenched in argan oil, which drowned out the taste of the other vege/fruit components.

The sliced jamon or ham was amazing. Definitely get a plate! The ham had a good balance of fat and lean meats and you can just feel the flavour sink into your tongue.

The grilled octopus was the winner. It was not chewy nor did it taste fishy. The meat was cooked to a tender state with the smokeness coming out in every bite.

Our server recommended an off menu item, the roasted quail. However, there was nothing special about it. Very medicore.

Overall, the service was good for a resturant in its price range. Come here if you are willingly to indulge in some decent Spanish food!"}
{"text":"Seems like these types of restaurants are popping up all over Charlotte offering a healthier option to fast food.  The production line set up makes the line easy to flow through if and only if you know what you want, if however you end up behind me, the line more than likely will come to a halt so I apologize in advance.  Anyway, choose your base and toppings and you'll be on your way.  I had the brown rice, roasted veggies(yellow beets, carrots, and cauliflower) amazing,  hummus (not the best tasting), olives, tomato cucumber salad, topped off with greek vinaigrette.  Again, it's a quick serve line, just tell them what you want and they move your bowl right down the line.  I've also added chicken or the braised lamb on other visits and the chicken was flavorful but not the case for the lamb.  They have pita bread that comes with your order and they may or may not remember to ask you if you want it but it's not that great so I would pass but they also have pita chips that don't come with your meal and is an additional charge, they are yummy so pay the extra for them.  The food is fresh and tasty, check it out."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Cava did not disappoint! Our waiter was on point the entire night recommending our entire meal with wine pairings for each course. The decor was so nice, not too loud, and a great crowd. I would 100% go back to try different variations of their menu. One more thing, the broken plates, cups, and dish wall was a wonderful decor piece! Well done everyone!"}
{"text":"Just finished work and decided to hit up a new place near the boyfriend's work. The restaurant is hidden in a little underground area and only opens for dinner service at 5pm. We walked in and we were the first guests' to arrive as it was a quarter to 5. We were seated a couple minutes later by a guy whom asked us if we'd like something to drink to start off so we decided to go with still water. Little did we know that they charge $3/person for still or sparkling water.. Never have I been to restaurant that charges that much for water. After serving our water, our waiter let us know a little bit about the portion sizes, what the average amount of dishes people order, and the types of food they have in their menu ranging from cold to hot dishes.  Then he gave us a couple of minutes to decide on what items we'd like to order. I was under the assumption that this restaurant was a spanish restaurant, only to realize that it was a tapas restaurant. After looking at the menu, we decided to start off with the 'supergilda' which tasted like a tater tot with cheese inside paired with a plum tasting dipping sauce to go with it. It tasted alright, nothing spectacular. After that, we decided to order the Grilled Beef Tongue with Celeriac Salad and Duck Albondigas and Gizzard Confit in Amontillado Sauce. I really liked the Beef Tongue surprisingly as I was hesitate because its an animals' tongue! The taste and texture of the Beef Tonuge was delectable and it came with a salad that tasted similar to coleslaw. I would definitely recommend this dish. The Duck Albondigas on the other hand was a little on the salty side and tasted more like meat balls with gizzard and sweet onions. After devouring those two dishes we decided we'd order one last dish called the Jamon Serrano, which was a cold dish. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish because it tasted like prosciutto, my favourite deli meat. Again on the salty side if eating it on its own but whatevs. In the end, we did not get charged for water, which was good because it was such a turn off to open a menu and having it state the charges for water. And they did give us a mini jello-like strawberry dessert, which I was not a fan of. All in all, it was an unexpected pricey dinner that we were not expecting. Food was mediocre for the obvious small portions being a tapas restaurant. I may or may not consider coming back here because of the price of the portions, even though this is a tapas restaurant, I like meals that I'm paying that much for to taste good AND satisfy my hunger without breaking my bank account."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times, mostly for birthdays. The \"let us cook for you\" menu is always a great choice and is usually excellent. They got rid of a chocolate flight which was phenomenal--bring it back!

I feel as though my experience tonight warrants this poor review, however. We came here for dessert (Don't get the churro, it wasn't good; Cheese plate was pretty good). 

Our waitress was awful. For most of the evening she stood with her back to us while she was catching up with friends (who were sitting at the table beside us). Is it so hard to make plans to see your friends outside of work? Come on. I should note that these 2-person tables are very close to one another, and that she was standing in between them (probably about 12 inches of space there to begin with). We ignored it at first because we didn't realize she would be standing there for so long, with her back to us and her butt in our faces.

We were there for about an hour, maybe more. Another waiter had to bring us the rest of our food. Nobody asked us how the food was or refilled our water. We flagged another waiter down for more bread while she continued to stand there, with her back to us, chatting.  

It could not have occurred to her that not only was she not doing her job by ignoring other paying customers, but that she was also being incredibly rude to us. 

Like I said, we've been here several times, and this is uncharacteristic of the service we normally receive at Cava. Hopefully it doesn't happen to anyone else. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Oh my! Let me tell you guys how good this place was. Just so happened I was off today when a friend posted about the opening special here where you get to try their food for free. I was absolutely pleased with every bite. Its new location is in the University area right across the street from the boardwalk next to blaze pizza. When I first arrived I was hesitant cause of the line and I was hangry but figured I'd give it a try cause partially my fault for coming a little late but the line moved quickly and they gave menus for you to look at while you wait.

This place is def chipotle made to order style. First thing that caught my eye is they point out who their partners are and where they get the ingredients from (love this cause I'm one of the health conscious people that like to know). I ordered the grain bowl with falafel, tzatziki, crazy feta, tomatoes, cucumbers,onions, romaine, mint, cauliflower quinoa, slaw, with the sriracha Greek yogurt to top it off. Oh! And it comes with warm fresh pita bread. They have a good selection of different drinks and partner with Appalachia for their cookies 

It ended up being much quicker than I expected and by the time I got home I could not wait to dive in. It was all that I imagined, had great customer service, and I definitely plan on returning! I just really hope they can keep it up after the opening."}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised to discover this D.C. gem here!  Just as good as the original!  Now we just need to get one in Atlanta!"}
{"text":"This is my third time to Cava and I can honestly tell you that this is one of the hidden gem in Toronto. Not only the taste on the foods and the selection of wines that they have. Most importantly the friendly, professional staffs from the Resturant and the warm decoration to make you have a enjoyable & relaxing dinner. Everything in the menu is worthy to give it a try. I need especially thanks to Kyle for his help to arrange the dinner menu. If you want to find a place to enjoy a dinner after a long day, Cava is one of the best choice you can consider."}
{"text":"a little pricey, but quality and interesting menu, i really enjoyed it and can go as far as saying it was one of the best places i have been to in the last year, excellent wine list and 5 star all around, service as also exceptional."}
{"text":"Cava Restaurant is literally a \"hidden gem\" as it is tucked away on the terrace of a plaza in Deer Park.  The restaurant is run by chef/restauranteur Chris McDonald, who formerly owned Avalon, creating intricate tasting menus and later a cured-meat program that lives on at Cava.  Most chefs who feature charcuterie on their menus were probably still in diapers when McDonald pioneered the movement.

This Spanish restaurant and wine bar features a delicious list of small plates from Basque to Catalonia.  As equally extensive is their list of wines, most notably a page-long Sherry section.  While oenophiles will want to enjoy their wine by the glass (or by the bottle), at Cava the wine isn't just made for sipping - it's also used to enhance flavours with dishes such as the Gamay-poached foie gras.

There's no need for background music as dinner chatter fills up the space.  I nabbed a seat at the bar and it was quite interesting watching the dynamic between the staff - can't say I've seen such a steady flow of communication or teamwork at any other restaurant in town.

My meal starts with the Gamay-poached foie gras with rhubarb compote and the Supergilda (a super-tapas with a pan con tomate as the base + a gilda (pincho) made of pickerel \"en escabeche\" secured with a skewer of anchovy fillet, olive + Guindilla pepper).  Alec, one of 2 sommelier's at Cava provided great pairings to go with each - a late harvest sémillon with the foie and a white sherry with the Supergilda.  The bread is buttery and crunchy and is more than just a serving vessel.

Continuing on next is a Kingfish Ceviche \"verde\" with lime juice, avocado + tomatillos which had just the right amount of zing to it.  To cut some of the spice, I sipped on a 2010 Tawse Echoes Riesling.

One of my favourite dishes of the night however, had to be the Miso-Cider Glazed Sablefish which cascaded off the fork in neat layers on a bed of black rice and braised escarole.   The fattiness of this fish made for a juicy, tender fish and the bed of black rice was a great choice to sop up the glazing liquids and natural juices of the fish for a boost of flavour.  This was paired with a Palacios Remondo Placét 2009, Rioja which had a nice floral and peach nose to it.

My second most favourite dish is the Fried Japanese Eggplant with queso fresco, honey + tomatillo topped with bonito flakes - the medley of ingredients was well-balanced and made for a symphony of flavours.  Cheese + honey are always a winning combination for me ;)

And for those who love a Baked Alaska, you won't have to wait until the next cruise ship vacation to have one.  McDonald's version features an airy layer of meringue which encases a lemon-pistachio ice cream with a saffron-pepper cake and sherry-poached pears.  The pistachio coats your mouth like peanut butter and the lemon cuts through some of the natural fats from the nut as the spongey cake layers join the party.  Truly an amazing dessert!

And a Spanish meal is incomplete unless Churros* make an appearance.  It is served with a pot of chocolate sauce + cajeta.

McDonald definitely knows how to excite the taste buds as his dishes have big, bold flavours without overwhelming the palate.  Umame, bitter, sweet, sour, salty - whatever your poison - you'll die a slow, but pleasant death after dining at Cava.

*Normal serving size has 5 churros.

{"text":"What a fantastic hidden -- literally, gem!!! After walking back and forth on Yonge someone finally directed me to the little opening where Cava sits amongst some other smaller places. 

Walking into this restaurant, the smell makes you want to start consuming dishes before you even sit down. The wine list is fantastic and we had a couple of bottles of the Syrah from France -- really really nice!

I came with a group of 4 and when being seated we were prompted that the menu was a sharing menu (as it's oh-so-popular now) and that we'd require between 10-12 dishes between us. Sounded absurd until you see just how small some of these are -- actually one bite...Things that really stood out on top of the wine were the filled red peppers; they had so much flavour. I ended up eating the duck dish to myself which was perfectly cooked and you can't go wrong with the churros! 

The service was a bit slow but at the same time it was nice not to be rushed while we were all catching up. I really enjoyed myself at Cava and would definitely return and recommend this spot to everyone!"}
{"text":"I don't like leaving reviews without photos, but in this case I have no choice... Since everything was eaten quicker than I had time to take my phone out! The style of the restaurant is to share meals (which I love) and I can honestly say every single meal was absolutely perfect! We got the scallop ceviche, poncho of edamame, supergilda (sardine dish), eggplant, king oyster mushrooms and sablefish. My absolutely favorites would be the eggplant and the mushrooms, both were cooked to absolute perfection. There are an abundance of vegetarian dishes which were amazingThe timing of all the dishes was perfect, the wine the waiter recommended was great and the overall atmosphere was so much fun! I would definitely order all the dishes we got again as they were all so incredible! We had a wonderful time, were already planning our next dinner there! It's definitely upscale, it's for special occasions, but it is absolutely perfect for a memorable night!"}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Pricey for sure. For two people the bill came out to 150$ including tax and tip, no drinks. We had the cerviche to start, then eggplant, followed by sablefish, king mushrooms, and finally pork jowl. We were stuffed with the shared 5 plates.

Favorite was the sablefish, melted in your mouth and so flavorful! Pork jowl was nice too but we were pretty full when it came out. Eggplant and king mushroom dishes were pretty unique and well seasoned. Cerviche was the only so so dish.

Service impeccable."}
{"text":"I'll start with saying I was super excited to see this chain coming to the Charlotte area. Another healthier, quick dine spot... YAY! 

This style restaurant is stand in line and order toppings as you go. They build your bowl or pita in front of you. They need better signs for the food so it's easier to order. I also think they really should offer a few side choices with at least one or two combos that are \"most popular\" choices. My fiancé wished that they had some preset choices for the pitas because he said he didn't know some of the ingredients and was unsure of matching flavor profiles. 

Other than the pointers and feedback listed above we had a great experience. My pita was huge but I did wish that I could have had a little side of veggies. The restaurant is very modern and simple in its design. The staff was very friendly and patient with us (first timers with tons of questions). The restaurant was very clean and bright. They offer some outdoor sitting with umbrellas on the side of the restaurant. 

Hoping for one to end up in the uptown area eventually!"}
{"text":"Had occasion to eat at Cava on the weekend for a special dinner and left fully satisfied with the quality of food, service and atmosphere.  Cava is about as close to Spain as I will get and if it is any indication, I can totally understand why Spain seems to be THE destination for the travelling gourmand.  It seems especially fitting with the recent closing of Ferran Adria's super celebrated \"El Bulli\", that I take my taste buds to the Iberian peninsula.  Truth be told El Bulli is a about as far from Spanish cuisine (or any cuisine) that one can get and is an unfair digression to write about it here however, be that as it may... Cava excels in what it does deliver. No comparisons necessary.  
In fairness the chef does put his own little twist on things to elevate it a notch. Dishes are served tapas style and it being a 'special dinner', the food just kept coming, each delicious plate its own special delight.   There is a regular menu that one can order from but it was nice to be surprised every 10 minutes or so.  With a little help from photographic evidence posted on Facebook, here is a run down of what we had:
Spicy fries with rosemary
Sardines on a crostini
Grilled calamari
Kingfish ceviche
Tamales
Elk skewers
Japanese eggplant with bonito flakes and fresh cheese curds
Pinot Noir poached foie gras
Black cod
Flank steak (or could be skirt steak - not sure at that point cuz the vino was flowing)
Baked cauliflower
and ending with Churros dipped in a spicy salty chocolate sauce.
Every single dish was a hit, each uniquely delicious as the next.
All of this was accompanied by some very special wines brought by the guest of honour.  Cava charges a reasonable corkage ($30, i think).  

Service was well paced and friendly and the atmosphere in Cava is quite lively.

What a great restaurant!  This is definitely the first of many repeated visits.

Super delicious!!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about the place.  And I tried really hard not to compare it to Black Hoof, but I can't help it. It's along the same genre of food. 
It IS however, a great addition to the uptown repetioire of restaurants. There's not around here like this, and some urbanites may not want to go to Dundas and Ossington and wait for 2hrs. 

The place is small, but I was still able to get a last min table at 8:30 for the same day. It's quite noisy, but my mom and I got a cozy spot in the corner. The duration of our meal was 1.5 hours. 

At first the menu looks tantalizing, but a closer look at the menu, you discover that there's nothing more special for the potato crisps than chips, or watercress dish is just stir fried veggies.  There were only a few things I found that were truly different. 

We got the Chacuterie Plate with home smoked sausages, a decedant chicken liver, and a proscuitto type thing.  It was okay ($16) and comes with bread, peppers/pickles. 
The grilled squid was good. So was the smokefish (expensive at $16.00 and served with some chinese veggies). The Eggplant is overrated, and served with bitter melon. It's much a chinese dish and 4 half small eggplants isn't really worth $8. 
The sweetbread was okay, but $19. Served on some beets and cabbage. 

The desserts looked really good, but I couldn't have any. they also gave us some pieces of chocolate when we got the bill. 

The service was okay. Each dish came out one at a time. Our empty dish sat on the table for no more than 5-10 mins and within the same time frame our new dish arrived.  My water was always filled. They were friendly. 

What was really disappointing was that XocoCava was closed next door, or I would have ordered dessert from the restaurant.  They weren't exactly closed. The door was open and my mom wanted to look at the chocolates, but they shouted at us away. How rude. 

I would recommend the place for a date, if you're looking for something different and don't want to wait long.  I think it would be difficult to come with more than 2 people. Each dish seemed only sharable for 2 and still come out somewhat full. We spent $50 per person including taxes, and one glass of wine (from their extensive list)"}
{"text":"Everything was nothing short of amazing. Excellent customer service, helpful, professional, and AMAZING FOOD! Greek version of Chipotle! Those pita chips are so dang good!"}
{"text":"After reading several reviews and hearing about CAVA from some Yelp friends, I decided to give it a try for lunch today and it was great! More and more places are going with the \"customize everything\" method and if you can keep things fresh and delicious then I'm a huge advocate for it.

Clean, minimal dining area with friendly staff. They have little tasting spoons beside the proteins so don't be shy to ask for a sample if you wish. Today the line of customers was massive, yet I wouldn't say they were understaffed, just a ton of customers. There's a point where adding more staff to a line-style service counter will just create chaos, so I'm not blaming them at all for the wait, they were moving crazy-fast anyway. If anything it shows how successful they already are and can handle a massive lunch service in stride. 

For my first visit I decided on the grain bowl that's served with your choice of several starches. I went with brown rice and lentils. The proteins all looked great but the brazed Lamb looked so moist and fresh, I couldn't resist. Top it off with lettuce, pickled onions, feta, mint, and a dill yogurt sauce, I'm allset. They also had some Tzatiki dip and feta spread (2 of their 6 \"spreads\") that was added to the middle of the bowl which I thought was a little odd, but ok!

Upon digging in, I realized why the line was nearly out the door: Fresh, Filling, and Fast Mediterranean cuizine that's delicious as well! The braised Lamb was so juicy and tender, great lentils and rice, all of the toppings had a cool, crisp texture. Everything about this bowl screamed Quality.

The only thing that was lost were those Tzatiki and Feta dips they added in the middle. Why the middle? There was nothing wrong with them, I just wasn't able to ID them individually in a bowl with so many other flavor profiles going on.

Apparently you can order ahead on their app as well. While worth the wait, I'll definitely be doing this next time. Can't wait to explore this menu more, a great addition to an already diverse collection of restaurants in the University area."}
{"text":"Was okay, usual expensive Tapa place. Nothing out of the extraordinary."}
{"text":"This place is really good! Healthy food options. Everything seemed fresh. I liked that they had falafel bowls since I am a vegetarian. Also great service. The owner greeted everyone and asked how everything was. When my friend wanted to try the falafel, I asked if I could buy one and they gave me one for free. The drinks lemonade options were really good too. And even though there was a really long line, it moved along quickly."}
{"text":"Making an appearance on nearly every \"Top Tapas\" list in Toronto, I had high expectations going in. Unfortunately, I was left disappointed as none of the dishes made my jaw drop (and then pick it up and continue chewing in amazement). And with the multiple-dished nature of tapas, you can't say they only had 3 courses to do so. 

With that being said, I will list of my favourites out of the ones we got. Since you'll probably still go anyways. Darn those highly influential \"Best of...\"lists.

Veal Sweetbread ($23) - Sweetbread is nicely deep fried, rich and smooth on the inside while crispy on the outside. If you're wondering what sweetbread tastes like - and I never use this phrase, but it tastes like chicken. The meat pairs nicely with the crunchy and tangy radicchio salad.
Pincho of Gamay-Poached Foie Gras ($9) - A definite yes for all foie gras lovers.
Eggplant with Queso Fresco - Can't go wrong when there's deep frying and cheese involved.
All the desserts - On the pricy side ($10-18), but totally worth it. They are all very unique (Pear and Sheep's Milk Ricotta Clafoutis? Hazelnut and Banana Baked Alaska? It took me 10 minutes just calm down from all excitement), made in house, and beautifully presented.

To conclude, Cava is worth visiting if you're in the area, craving some decent tapas and some very awesome desserts. But I would not \"tapa\" that again."}
{"text":"I was recommended to this place while I visited  Toronto. Let me know recommend it to you all. Super nice place. Nice environment, excellent food, and super good service. 
This is their first time I try Spanish cruisine. The waiter picked dishes for us. I love all of them. Thanks to him,  I like all of them. 
Sooner after we got there, Cava is packed. Recommend you to make reservation before you get there."}
{"text":"I hate to give them such a low score because the flavor of the food is amazing, but there's more to a restaurant than that...
My first time eating here was the end of March. A friend suggested this as the perfect place for me to try out as a vegetarian. As far as flavor they are completely unmatched! 

Cons-
The food is always lukewarm! I've gone right when they open, right when they close, in the middle of the day, the weekends, weekdays and every visit their food has been consistently lukewarm. I hate using microwaves but I'm forced to with this.

Good Customer Service is obviously not a skill required to become hired. On every occasion, all of the staff is just terrible! They barely greet you. They always move extremely slow whether they are busy or not, they make it clear that you are on their time. Do not ask them any questions about the items they sell! They will respond with an attitude or have no knowledge about what you're asking them; So apparently knowledges of menu isn't a requirement either. All the staff acts as though they are not interested in being there every time I visit. I expect a friendly environment when I walk into Cava but honestly it seems like they hired the McDonald's staff from down the street,. 

I'm going to take a break from Cava for a few months in hope that they will improve their customer service skills, otherwise I won't be returning,.


If you are willing to put up with piss poor customer service and lukewarm but absolutely delicious food, then this is the place for you.,"}
{"text":"Probabaly one of the best Spanish restaurants in Toronto and the servers are very friendly and accommodating. The halibut and avocado ceviche was outstanding. Everything was great. Most the menu is tapa sharing dishes so you get to try more items. Me and my friend ordered 7 items between the two of us it was perfec"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday, found it difficult to find as you have to walk in the alley to find the restaurant. It is a small restaurant with pleasant staff however the air conditioner was not turned high enough making the dinner unpleasant. I came across this restaurant on Instagram and really wanted to try the seafood paella. I was a bit disappointed because it was extremely expensive, was a small portion and lacks flavour. The paella was  $65- had a few clams, octopus sausage and beans. I was not a big fan of the beans mixed in the paella, there was way too much which diluted the flavouring (beanie taste). Portion wise, we were only able to have 1 bowl each (3 ppl in total). I also tried the halibut ceviche and deep fried eggplant. The ceviche was extremely sour, however the avocado helped dilute the sourness. I wished there was more avocado. The best dish of the night would be the deep fried egg plant. It was super delicious. I love the extra touch of mozzarella cheese and the Japanese onion on top."}
{"text":"CAVA  is the equivalent of a Mediterranean chipotle. The atmosphere is nice, it was extremely clean. We went during lunch, and I have never eaten there before. The staff was friendly, and patient. As I had no idea of what I truly wanted. My suggestion would be for a new person, to pay sure self, do not try to put all the fixings on the salad if that is what you choose."}
{"text":"Excellent service while seated at the bar.  I had the Octopus Tiradito appetizer, followed by the oyster mushroom second, and finished it off with the Sabel fish.  The roasted pepper of the appetizer gave the dish a very nice smokey aroma which complimented the octopus quiet well.  The saltiness of the olives also was a nice accent to the octopus which was not over cooked as so often they can be.  The oyster mushroom though I think stole the show and must be tried to be believed.  The mix of earthy and salty flavors from the squash mole combined with fresh flavors from the Chayote really elevate this dish above the rest my meal.  The sabel fish was probably my least favorite, but that doesn't mean it was bad, but I think there are a few missteps in execution.  

First, the fish was not seasoned consistently with some bites that were much saltier than others.  For a small portion like they have I feel like it should have been better seasoned.  Secondly and perhaps more importantly, I my collard greens ended up soaking up all the oil and was very greasy.  I think the idea of having some slightly bitter greens to contrast the flavor of the fish is the right one but the execution could have been better.

With that said, I still think this is one of the better restaurants in Toronto.  Don't be fool by the yelp price guide though, if you are looking to get full and have a drink with your dinner, your looking at 85 CAD or more/person."}
{"text":"I  this place!!! I went for lunch first and didn't know what to expect. The gentleman who assisted me was AMAZING in breaking down the menu and letting me sample things I wasn't sure of. I had such an amazing time that I returned for dinner that night. I also highly recommend the fresh juices. I had the Watermelon Mint and it's swoon worthy"}
{"text":"Highly recommended!! This is one of the best, if not the best Mediterranean casual joint that has arrived to Charlotte. The food is fresh and you won't get tired with all the different combinations you can make, topped with the awesome natural lemonades. Also, Ivar, the manager is very customer oriented, kudos to that guy!"}
{"text":"We went to Cava on my birthday last Friday, the overall experience was great.  The waitress was helpful in helping us make our selections and service was excellent.  It was so good that I asked our waitress if they're open on Sunday, Jan 1st  for us to return with a few other friends.  Unfortunately they're close on new year's day.  

Back to the meal, i had the supergilda (sardine) as my first dish which was a great way to start.  Salt cod was excellent.  Be sure to order the 24hr braised beef brisket, i think it's a winner.  

On the down side we also ordered the cured pork which we find just OK... I've had better prosciutto bought from my local butcher.    

To finished we shared the warm chocolate cake and even though it took 20 mins to arrive (our waitress had advised us prior) it's worth the wait.  

PS - Cava has a very good selection of wine at a premium just like in any other restaurants.  I'd suggest going on a SUNDAY as corkage is $0.   (it's also the reason why I ask them if they're open on Jan 1st)"}
{"text":"Food taste great. Plenty variety of proteins, veggies, dips, salads and sauces. You can choose from bowls, wraps, pitas, salads and soup. I would say they are extremely vegetarian friendly since its Mediterranean. No problem at all to 'eat clean' here. They move pretty quickly thru the line even when crowded. Reasonably priced for fresh healthy food. I spent around $12.00 for a generous grain and salad bowl and my beverage. Restaurant is cute inside and out. Seat yourself and clear your table when done. I'm thrilled to finally have a quality fresh food place on this side of town. I think parking might be a problem in the future though."}
{"text":"Some of the food was cooked perfectly but some left a lot to be desired.. prices did not match the level of quality.."}
{"text":"This food is super clean and healthy and makes you feel like you're making the right choices in life. Beware of how many choices you'll be faced with. This restaurant is not for the indecisive. Go ahead and step out of line and start to make your decisions before you get caught in front of the professional orderers. Everything on the menu it's healthy and full of flavor. It's a great fast casual option and you really can't go wrong with anything you choose."}
{"text":"Question: What is the difference between a postage stamp and the potion sizes at Cava?
Answer:    None.
Great food and service, but be prepared to drop some serious money in order not to leave hungry due to the minuscule portion size of dishes.
Memorable dishes include the Ceviche and the Piquillo pepper filled with smoked heritage chicken.
Forgettable dishes include the Croqueta of Jamon with caper-sultana sauce and the sardine special recommended by our server, (who was extremely attentive).
The other issue is we could only procure a very early dinner start time but there were at least 3 empty tables for four people that sat empty for the almost two hours we were there which means we could have had a later dinner time which we wanted.
Wonderful wine selection.
Lovely, romantic atmosphere. Some people were dressed up and others quite casual, which gives people the option."}
{"text":"Had supper their recently for the first time. The choices were plentyful and the ingredients had a lot of flavor ,however, I had several bites of grit in mine as if something hadn't been washed properly, and the serving line itself wasn't very clean. Doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"Food is really good!!! Just toooooo slow for everything..... But still will come back again to try more dishes~"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Cava. Color me impressed. My first experience was when I ran over to get an order for my coworker. It was lunchtime and understandably busy But, the staff was good at keeping the line moving. I returned a few hours later for myself and made sure it wasn't during a busy time since I didn't know how long I would be. I literally just threw a bowl together not knowing what I liked. I don't remember what I got but, it was DELICIOUS! I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I finally was able to try CAVA!I ordered a chicken bowl with a variety of toppings (came with pita).As I was going through the line,I thought to myself \"this is like a Mediterranean Chipotle.\" Well,I am here to tell you Chipotle has competition because in my opinion CAVA is better.The variation of fresh items to choose from is so exciting and you can create your dish any way you like.Some categories do have a max amount of three scoops before being charged extra (i.e. dips/spreads) but three scoops is enough.Just to give you an idea,some of the toppings are pickled onions,diced tomatoes & cucumbers,cabbage slaw,mint,and more.No matter what you choose,I believe the dish would still come out tasting amazing!

The location is convenient as this is a new,growing area of University.If you are ever in the area give it a try!"}
{"text":"Omg this place was so good! I got a salad and rice bowl and it was delicious. The dressings were light and their are so many options for toppings. If you're looking for a healthy and delicious Mediterranean meal this is it! My only issue is that there is not a location in Winston, so I'll def be traveling to Charlotte for this!"}
{"text":"First time here. Crowded and similiar to Chiptole. Food was sooo good. They definetly need to make more locations throughout charlotte. This could be the new \"it\" franchise.."}
{"text":"Love this place ... Fresh and Healthy ... lots of variety and options to choose from to compliment the continued healthy eating habits"}
{"text":"Just came back from this wonderful tapas bar and I was so full that I couldn't even look at a nearby grocery store. The place has about 30-40 different tapas to choose from in addition to various wines and sangría. The waiter recommends to order 3-4 tapas per person and he is quite right - I had 3. I find that the tapas here are bigger than say at Toritos and definitely more filling. We had 12 different dishes for 4 people (including a 10 year old kid), with every one of them being quite delicious.
I would especially recommend the sablefish (it melts in your mouth), papas fritas, king fish ceviche, the quail, duck and anchovy sandwiches, and bruschetta with edamame and green onions. I would advise to stay away from la charcuteria since they only give you a bit of chorizo, duck breast, liverwurst and some other sausage - aside from chorizo, not very Spanish at all. Also beware that the alcohol is not the cheapest: $11 for a glass of red wine and $9 for a glass of sangría.
The place itself is not too dark and is not very noisy even on a Saturay night. In short, this is a great restaurant with a very comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am so glad to see a relatively healthy food spot in university!! As a student it's difficult to be on the run and eat right, but CAVA really helped today! The ingredients were so flavorful, so many options, and the staff we super friendly. Can't wait to make this a frequent stop!!"}
{"text":"Cava

Solid fast casual addition to the offerings in this university area for the lunch and dinner crowd. It seems that Cava will be many places around Charlotte in the coming months. 

Do you want a meal that is colorful, flavorful, has nice textural variety, and leaves you feeling good? Cava is your spot and is a very well executed grain bowl/salad place. Similar to other brands, the bread is one of the few weak spots; it just doesn't hold a candle to the laffa at Yafo. 

Stopped in on a random weekday and was pleas d with the efficiency and cleanliness. I'm not up this way that much, but this would be a solid place to keep on rotation."}
{"text":"Since Cava opened when I used to live in the neighborhood, I have been a fan. I have read the other reviews and I don't understand the negatives. Yes, Cava was among the first in the city to do the small plates thing, and they are still doing it. I don't think that is a negative. I find the food always fresh, original and delicious and the service is good too.

On Monday night I went with a couple of friends and our server Allesandro was very attentive. He liked to show off his language skills and his knowledge of the menu. The three of us could not decide what to order so we left it in Allesandro's hands. He did a good job! 

We had the foie gras (nice and thick and decadent, as it should be), a green apple and fennel salad, kingfish ceviche (a healthy portion of yum!), octopus, cheese, and he even brought us an assortment of chocolates at the end.

Cava is a lovely experience. To the other reviewers, you are not going to enjoy life if you compare every meal to the Black Hoof. Once you stop doing that, you'll have a much better time!"}
{"text":"ok, this place has some serious food!

we came to TO to spend the weekend with friends, this place has been voted top 5 restaurants in Toronto two years in a row, they have been a couple times and raved about it, we introduced them to yelp and went through some reviews with them on the place - it was ranking at 3.5 stars and i was trying to figure out why

service and price seemed to be the two biggies for people poo pooing the place - however the elite yelpers were ranking 4 and 5 stars - and there were a couple 2 star people that have done like 5 reviews or less, so you take those with a grain of salt.

so anyway, off we go - Tapas style spanish restaurant on young buried in the back of a little mall courtyard, reservations are for 8:30 - they seat us right away and take drinks orders as we cruise through the menu and it's suggested that we pick between 10 - 12 items to fill the 4 of us up.

we ordered the chipotle-caramel popcorn and warm marinated olives to start - i'm a popcorn freak and had to try - amazing, can't stand olives so i passed on the other one, the other 3 enjoyed those

i'm going to focus on 2 or 3 dishes because everything was 4 to 5 stars in my book

The Foie Gras was supposed to be outstanding so it got ordered, and we finally opted for the 48 hour brisket.

The Pincho of Gamay-Poached Foie Gras with Prune Plum Mostarda was so delicate and smooth it was incredible, the Foie Gras was literally sliced onto a crustini, and then topped with the mostarda which you spread over the Foie Gras - our vegetarian friend tried it as well and everyone absolutely loved it......the 2nd best thing on the menu maybe.......

the best thing was the brisket........and trust me i know brisket! my friend and i both had a \"brisket off\" 8 weeks prior - one method was a 24hr brine, 1hr BGE smoke, and then a 24 sous vide cook, the other method was a dry rub marinade, and then smoked on the egg for 8 hours at approx 225 degrees, both were amazing......we know our brisket and frankly originally poo pooed the brisket because who could make it better then us.  we were still alittle hungry when we were getting down to the end of the menu, so we opted to give there's alittle try.

OMFG, absolutely like butter in your mouth, i couldn't believe it.....so much so we started in on the waitress, how was it cooked? was it brined? what temp? how can they get a oven that low? was it cooked in a broth? (had to be we figured, no way to keep it that moist), on and on, so finally they said the chefs would love to talk to us.......away we went with our wine - and started chatting with them at the pass, totally in the way of the servers.....sorry about that.  They were super friendly and gave us all the details......which we won't share, as we are going to try and replicate their technique.

the service all night was amazing, fantastic food, great little spot - we drank two bottles of wine, one round of cocktails, and ate probably 10 dishes including dessert and the total bill with tip was around $110 each.......frankly for any great restaurant, that's a deal.

i don't understand these other reviews giving this place a two star, but then i realize that anybody can use yelp and that can be the down side......look at who's giving this place 4 and 5 stars and you be the judge.

enjoy toronto you are very lucky, we'll be back next time we're in town

from a super foodie elite yelper looking to pass on great finds."}
{"text":"Pretentious host who ushered my husband & I to a table beside the kitchen and hesitated when we requested a better table. Mackerel salad drowned in a heavy dressing. Eggplant was tasty. Sable fish was good. Finished with excellent coffee. Overall expensive & pretentious."}
{"text":"This was my first time at cava. I would recommend looking at the menu before going there were a lot of choices. I got a salad with kale mix, chicken, quinoa, and cauliflower. I used a vinaigrette dressing. Overall the food wasn't bad but as a picky person there weren't many things I would try. It's definitely a place to try at least once."}
{"text":"Sooooo I may be a little addicted to Cava. As others have mentioned, this place is set up very similarly to Chipotle. Assembly line preparation with your choice of toppings, sauces, and protein.

Cava is a very welcome addition to the University community in the boardwalk shopping center that already contains a plethora of fast-casual dining options. It shares a parking lot with the neighboring Dunkin' Donuts, Pei Wei, City Barbecue, etc. 

I was surprised that the interior is on the smaller side. When you walk in, the line begins to the right and, if it's peak time, there are handheld menus for you to peruse and help you make up your mind while waiting.

So far, I've only had the pita option. There is a standard size and a mini size. A single mini pita will run you $4 (plus tax) and the standard is double that amount. Depending on how hungry you are, the mini can be filling enough for a lighter lunch.

Their roasted vegetables are my absolute favorite. I have found them to be very flavorful and hearty enough to take the place of meat. I usually go with half veggies and chicken, tzatziki sauce, tomato & onion spread, and romaine. I did try the spicy lime sauce but I just wasn't that big of a fan. Their ginger lime turmeric juice is my favorite and something I consider a must-try.

If you also find yourself a CAVA fan, I personally recommend downloading the CAVA app. You'll be able to order your food and have it ready for pick up at the register (in cubbies that are alphabetized). You'll want to do this because this place gets packed.

If you are skeptical of Mediterranean food, I suggest giving CAVA try. There is something you're bound to like!"}
{"text":"Taaahhhhpas. Yum.

Consistency is underrated. How many times have you enjoyed a restaurant once, and gone back only to be disappointed? Cava is constant. Fresh, tasty ingredients, nice ambiance, attentive staff - everytime. It's a great little neighbourhood gem.

If you're an appetizer person, then you love Tapas. Cava's menu choices balance classic spanish food with the North American palate.

Some of my favorites include the yummy Avocado Pinchos (little bites), Pineapple and Jicama Salad, Serrano Ham, Papas Fritas (french fries cooked with sage & rosemary, accompanied with a biting paprika mayo).

The latest meal there they offered a Bean/Tarragon/Chevre/Cilantro/Shallot concoction that tip-toed on my palate. 

It is a little noisy as it fills up, but not enough to drown out the intimate conversation with your date."}
{"text":"We went for the 3 tapas + beer for $20 promotion. The tapas were small but very tasty, esp the smoked mackerel and asparagus. We supplemented our order with Cava's wonderful papas fritas and their great churros with dark chocolate. In all, a very fine light dinner on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service was superb. The inside was for even for a Tuesday after a long weekend!!!! But the outside as available, so I would recommend booking if the atmosphere is important to you. 
It's costly but worth it for a special occasion:)"}
{"text":"We visited Cava once and had a great time about a year ago. This time around, not so much. Service was seriously lacking, we were left sitting around waiting for plates to be cleared, never offered a second round of drinks, and it was never clear who our waiter was. 

The charcuterie was great, sweetbreads were overcooked and the ending pecan \"kisses\" were weird and squishy, like uncooked dough. When we asked what they were, one of our waiters explained it as \"some kind of pecan sugar and water mix\" with his nose crinkled like he was not a fan. Disappointing given our great experience the first time around, will not be back again. We stood around looking lost at the end of dinner because we needed someone to take our coats. Eventually someone noticed and brought them over."}

I've been looking for more healthy restaurants alternative in Charlotte, so I'm V happy that there's one so close to home now.(: I get the half and half bowl, I normally go for the falafel -very good!

{"text":"Decent lunch spot for a quick bite. Food felt seemingly healthy and was more than filling.  This place is kind of like the chipotle of Mediterranean food and that amount of autonomy can definitely lead you astray with how much variety there is. I gave this place 4 stars because it was good, but nothing mind blowing."}
{"text":"Four of us met for a Sunday dinner at Cava and a truly delightful meal.  We had a reasonably priced bottle of Rioja with several tapas selections: a couple of orders of pincho of avocado and avruga (essentially a bruschetta), two orders of \"supergilda\" (highly recommended), roasted beet salad with kale, jamon iberico (not as nice as patria's), eggplant with queso fresco, honey and tomatillo sauce (quite a memorable dish), roasted brussel sprouts with black garlic (exquisite), papas fritas (best fries ever with some amazing aioli) and of course the piece de resistance, the best paella we've ever had.  To top it off, for dessert we had churros con chocolate and valrhona chocolate souffle with spanish coffee sauce.  The meal, with wine, came to less than $90/person, which for the overall experience is a bargain in my books.  We in Toronto are quite fortunate to have the trifecta of Bar Isabel, Patria and Cava for some truly incredible tapas restaurants to choose between."}
{"text":"4.5 stars...Was taken here for my birthday and this place is really hidden...tucked inside the building...Thankfully there is paid parking...which works out fine.. 

Our main server was sooo nice..best service I've had in a very long time... He explained everything to the dot, was nice and genuine, recommended nice wine, kept refilling our waters and checked up on us very often...superb service... 

Appetizers were enjoyable... pincho was a bite.. my fav was the avocado with salt cod... yummms...ordered the foie gras...which came with toast and it was put together nicely... 

We ordered the jamon which is pork thighs, and the eggplant... it was delightful...the dishes were slightly smaller but It's fine as long as quality was there... 

We ended up eating literally everything.. just didn't lick the dishes... Lol...

Dessert, we ordered the Baked Alaska and boy was that divine...soo yummy.. with perfectly put together hazelnut banana cake..

Definitely coming back no doubt..."}
{"text":"Can't miss the pinchos of avocado & avruga, papa fritas, charcuteria, and the sablefish."}
{"text":"Best way to describe it the Mediterranean chipotle with bigger portions! Friendly staff with great enthusiasm. Definitely one of my favorite spots to eat healthy!"}
{"text":"I'm really excited Cava, has come to University City and Charlotte. I'd heard about it and all the good things I heard were true.

This restaurant is set up so you can create your own Mediterranean meal, be it a pita wrap or bowl , and it is vegan, vegetarian , and meat eater friendly. 

I love Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food for the flavor and Cava does not disappoint, simply because it's 'fast-food'. There is no drive-thru, you do have to go in.

This visit I did a rice/grain bowl mix with Saffron rice ( brown is also available) and lentils ( these were black lentils). Because there wasn't enough falafel for to truly call it a serving, I got half falafel and half seasonal roasted veggies as my protein. What's cool is they'll let you sample sauces and spreads ( Baskin Robins style ) before you add them to your bowl. The Spicey feta was SO good, topped it all off with even more fresh veggies ( onions , lettuce, purple cabbage, etc) and a Tahini dressing which was BOMB. 

I highly recommend stopping by here when you're in University City, it's located at the Boardwalk, which is also near one of the new light rail blue line stops."}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try cava for a while and finally got the chance and am so glad we did. 

We let them cook for us and what followed was a masterful execution of technique and deliciousness.  

Started with the super Gilda, followed by a tomato broth soup with pork, ceviche, sous vide beef with radishes, eggplant, lamb with quinoa and Brussels sprouts, veal sweetbreads, and finally finishing with foie gras.  It was a delicious start to finish and we left very satisfied.  So much balance to every dish.   Recommend for special occasions!

Great wine list and lovely cocktails.  I had a sherry whiskey concoction that set the appetite perfect and she went with a mojito, and we shared a bottle of wine after that! Can't wait to go back and indulge again!"}
{"text":"I visited after a friend recommended Cava. Quick service and fresh food. Customized my order - saffron basmati, lentils, crazy feta, harissa, roasted red pepper humus, braised lamb, pickled onions, olives and pita crisps. The ginger lime turmeric drink is a must try."}
{"text":"YES YES YES YES, University area NEEDED this place. We have almost every food type expect Mediterranean and CAVA is some amazing food. It's fresh, customizable and very pleasing to the taste buds! Check this out ASAP! (P.S- their falafel is not my favorite every, but it's still good)"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to order or expect, but was helped by the friendly staff to a healthy but filling meal that was also delicious. I had rice with lentils and lamb meatballs with a lot of toppings. Everything was fresh, and I really enjoyed the ginger turmeric juice. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"WOW! So flavorful and so many combinations. CAVA does not disappoint and is a welcome fast casual addition to the dining options at Birkdale. 

I ventured here for lunch today with 3 women from work, (thankfully 77 was cooperating, because we all know how that can be!). We were able to jump in the line right away and make our selections. The best way I can describe their fast casual style is that it's a mix of Chopt and Chipotle but with Mediterranean fare that is so fresh and flavorful. I had bowl of greens with their Super Greens Mix, an eggplant hummus, red pepper hummus, and tahini, half lamb and half chicken, cucumber, tomatoes, olives, pita, and a light drizzle of dill yogurt sauce. If your mouth is watering, (and it should be), let me tell you that while water is a great option, their in house juices are the way to go. I had a watermelon mint juice that was out of this world. All in all it was $15 for a bowl of healthy deliciousness.

It looks like a significant portion of their business was carry out as they have a whole wall where you can pick up to-go orders. The cashier also mentioned that they have a frequent diner app that you can earn rewards with. I am officially a fan and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Some coworkers took me to lunch today and this was my first experience at CAVA. We had lunch around 1215 on 5/22. It was awesome! I had the salad and it was very filling and prices are fair. 
I like that they use locally NC farmers to get their ingredients.
Highly recommended place to eat for a good lunch that's quick, friendly and healthy all while supporting local farmers!"}
{"text":"Had been reading all about CAVA, so I made a 30 mile drive north to meet my friend, Toni, there for lunch.  It was exactly what I expected: fresh mediterranean-type food offered in build your own bowls. Think YAFO in the SouthPark area.  I selected a bowl with the greens as the base.  I added a lot of great veggies and my two proteins were pulled chicken and falafel.  Also added a few different types of hummus, which were served in the bowl as small scoops. They were almost like sample sizes and I wish they would have been a bit more generous with those portions.   The pitas looked really good (Toni enjoyed hers), but I tried hard to avoid the extra carbs.   Since this is in the University area, I was not surprised to see all the college kids roaming around.  It was very loud during the lunch hour, which made it difficult to carry on a conversation.  That became better as we sat for awhile.  It was fun watching some unidentified male millennial walking around with a shaved head and a man bun in the back.  Hmmmm, I'm not sure if I am horrified or a little jealous that I can't pull off that look!  If I'm up in that area again, I will not be hesitant to return to Cava.  Hopefully my scoops of hummus will be a bit larger.  And speaking of serving sizes, the \"to go\" containers looked larger than the \"dine in\" bowls.  My suggestion is to make sure you get your meal in a \"to go\" container, even if you're planning to dine there!"}
{"text":"Cava was so delicious! Is it bad to say my favorite of the night was the Warm Marinated Olives - i really think I am an olive fan after eating these perfectly salty olives. The Halibut Ceviche was really delicious - first time having halibut this way and the fish was cut into thick large chunks which soaked up the lime, cilantro & onion flavours. The corn nuts gave it texture but the pieces are kind of big which could be too much for some people. I liked my cocktail Spanish Steps - full of orange & grapefruit at first, followed by the alcohol aftertaste.

The fried Japanese Eggplant was good when hot, didn't really care for the cheese. King Oyster Mushrooms were good; Beets were good but we opted out of the blue cheese. Duck Breast was cooked perfectly and was good on its own or paired with the lentils. 

The Fries are literally just fries with rosemary when I'd expected the usual patatas bravas with potato cubes in tomato sauce - still good but not very Spanish (although the server and menu clearly states fries so just my own misinterpretation). 

Overall a very satisfying meal. The restaurant is kind of hidden and seems out of place from the outside ie. a fancy restaurant in the midst of more casual stores. Good for groups of 2!! It can get quite loud inside so you can choose to sit outside which faces the plaza of other stores, not the street."}
{"text":"We went with the \"just trust us\" menu and all the dishes that came out were amazing!  The flavours were unique and complimented each other well.  From sardines, to octopus, to sweetbreads it all was delicious.  Ended off with Churros.   Amazing service, enjoyed our dining experience."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience for my first visit at Cava and this location. The employees are so friendly and professional especially Bre she made me feel so welcomed and appreciated. I was having such a bad day and she turned it around with such a positive attitude! Way to go girl! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food! The veggies are very fresh and the options are healthy which is nice. It's kind of like a chipotle / subway style place but the food is even better. A must try for those who like Mediterranean cuisine!"}
{"text":"Food is good but I am disappointed that I paid $2.75 for a side order of eggplant red pepper dip and I got this..less than a tablespoon of dip."}
{"text":"I hope to return to try other items on the menu.  Very good food, nice atmosphere, very good service, and a reasonable price for the quality (mind you my reference is New York City).  It came to about $50 a head, without alcohol.  Certain dishes seemed overpriced, but others provided great value.

FOOD:
I highly recommend this place for the food.  I'm not sure this is really a straightforward 'tapas bar'; there are a few bite-sized pieces, but the majority of the dishes are larger, all intended to be shared.  Our favorites were the eggplant, the duck breast and the sweetbreads.  Also the foie gras pincho.  Dessert was killer (quince frangipane tart, totally awesome).

The cheaper of the two 'jamons' was the only disappointing item -- just cold chewy mouthfuls of fairly good ham with no accompaniment.  Also there weren't quite enough greens on the menu, IMHO -- it's a little crowded with fried fat hipster dishes -- so we asked for a side of greens off-menu, which was excellent.

SERVICE:
The servers gave us a lot of room, but provided detailed descriptions when asked, to the point of overkill in some cases.  Timing and staging of the dishes was near-perfect.  This really added to the pleasure of the meal, though we did sit waiting for ten minutes between one pair of dishes (might have been an intentional delay between 'appetizers' and 'mains'), and we waited for a while on the check.  Also I heard the waiters bicker with each other once, which is always a little unsettling.  All in all the service was very good, and I was pleased that the side of greens we requested (not technically on the menu) was priced very reasonably.

AMBIANCE:
Music is a little too loud, but since there are some soft surfaces in there the general level of noise is manageable.  Good spacing of tables (probably considered tight for Toronto?) and lots of conversation, a good warm vibe overall.  Sure beats 95% of noisy NYC restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is basically Chipotle with middle eastern flavors, but it's one step above Chipotle in that if you order your bowl with salad as the base, the salad is made of finely shredded mixed greens that mix in easily with your grains or other toppings. Sounds like a small thing but it makes a difference. They aren't scared of flavors. Everything's full of herbal green goodness, even the juice. If your dining agenda includes eating more vegetables, you can basically get a large bowl of all kinds of them, with a little serving of protein and some delicious cheesy and spicy toppings added to round it out. Even the drinks are relatively virtuous -- I tried a cup of some herbal strawberry stuff expecting it to be a sugar bomb, and was pleasantly surprised that it was not."}
{"text":"BLESS IT! Ok, so today was my first time experiencing Cava! I found out about their free pre-opener event from #cltfreebies. So glad I looked into this because the food is AMAZING! 

Walking up of course there was still some construction outside as the area it self is still remodeling. But walking in to Cava the aroma was so welcoming and the staff was their to greet you with a HUGE smile! Provide you with the cutest little menu and asked if you needed help with selections. I did have a few questions with a young lady assisted me with, then once my friend arrived we proceeded to the line. 

Of course two health nuts could decide what the wanted we started tasting a little bit of this, getting a side of that, telling them to put a little here and a little there... before we knew it we were finish and with a bowl full! The free entree meal came with a drink as well!

\\HERES THE KICKER//
I'm not sure if many people recognized this or not but this incredible company not only are giving every person that walks through their doors today and tomorrow free meals, they are donating the price of each persons meals to Charlottes local nonprofit organization SOW MUCH GOOD! NOW if that's not LOVE I don't know what is! And I'm a sucker for community outreach and that's honestly what grabbed my attention and my heart to drive 30minutes from my Home to experience this place. 

Thankfully I also had a few minutes to chat with Chris the store Manager and hopefully he will be looking to bring location number three to Rivergate or Berewick area!"}
{"text":"This is a new place that gets its delicious ingredients locally! I got the \"build it\" I got a little bit of almost everything to try as it is my first time! And I must admit this better than any Mediterranean food I've tried!!! My favorite things were the white rice and greens, their chicken, all of their toppings are great and very fresh, and their drinks bar. The drinks are absolutely delicious! So much flavor and not so much sugar! Healthy option and very filling! I would suggest this to anyone searching for clean and healthy food options!"}
{"text":"Cava is now on my radar, and will stay there.

My friend and I sat at the bar and got to chat with the very knowledgeable barman, who suggested unique drink pairings for each tapas that we received. Here is what I ordered and my impression:

- Foie Gras: Probably the best I have ever had (5/5)
- Ceviche with chips: Smokey and fresh (5/5)
- Eggplant with queso freso: Very interesting, something I had never had before (4/5)
- Salt cod cake: nothing special ( 2/5)
- Beef brisket: Tender, juicy and a good sized portion ( 4/5)
- Grilled squid: Very good but not surprising (3/5)
- Cauliflower tagine: Flavors were not very developed (2/5)

I started with Cava, which resembled champagne- it was okay,

The barman then suggested a 12 year old Oroso Sherry..which was mind blowing.

I walked away feeling like I had just been on a food adventure.

Lovely."}
{"text":"I go here once a week now after trying it for the first time about a month ago. Everything here is so fresh and you feel so healthy while eating this amazing food. Similar process as Chipotle's burrito bowl in the sense that you choose your ingredients as you go. Each associate is great at explaining the ingredients to you and what they have which is really great since it's food most of us here probably aren't used to. They have an amazing selection of teas as well and have recycling options next to their trash. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Supergilda and Foie Gras were so good, cauliflower was too sweet for my taste, greats service and reasonable price."}
{"text":"The place was very clean. Friendly staff. Good quakity fresh food. Hubby and I had a bowl with greens and grains and meatballs with tona of toppings. All the flavors blend well together. First time here i will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a really good place!  I had the bowl and the pita bread and it was amaze balls!!!! The customer service was on point and the lemonade was organic and good!  This place is like your Chipotle of Mediterranean food and they keep the restaurant very clean.  I will continue to dine here on one of my cheat days!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was here sooner. I love Mediterranean food and Cava hits the spot. Many different offerings and an extremely friendly staff. Even if you are not sure about Mediterranean food still check Cava out. Not only is the food 10/10 but the juices/teas are extremely fresh."}
{"text":"This place has only been open a short amount of time, but I've already been twice! For my first visit, I wasn't sure what to order, so I took advice from another Yelp review and ordered the half greens/half grain bowl with veggies instead of protein. I got 3 spreads: the eggplant and red pepper, the roasted red pepper hummus and the crazy feta, and loved ALL of them! For toppings, I did cucumbers, tomato and red onion, feta cheese, and their cauliflower quinoa tabbouleh. Lastly, I had it topped with their yogurt tzatziki. This combo was SO good, that I ordered it exactly again on my second visit. The portions are large and I've added the side of pita both times, so I was able to have it for lunch and then the leftovers as a large snack.

Another really awesome thing about this place is the management. My fiance and I met Chris on our most recent visit after just closing on our house. As our food was being made, he asked about our day and learned about a big life event. When we got to the end of the line to pay, we were told \"80 cents\".. for two large meals! I thought I misheard her, but it was legit. Chris later came over to our table and we chatted about his recent move to CLT and the other Cava's he plans to open. What an awesome dude!

As far as the location, this one is super close to UNCC and those of us who work there really appreciate this as a healthy option that can be reached within the hour lunch window. The line tends to be long at lunch, but it moves super fast."}
{"text":"A Mediterranean Chipotle with more choices and better quality.  I really enjoyed the choices available and high end flavors for a casual stand up order restaurant.  Great value for a quick and healthy lunch."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here for the 2nd time and it was great! The service is quick and easy. I think meal portion is good and the price is fair. I definitely recommend this place especially if you're looking for a health option."}
{"text":"Whoa! Shout out to my fellow Yelper, Chris. He was not exaggerating in his review. To quote my husband \"It's like a party in my mouth! There are a lot of flavors I want to get to know better\" We went with the grain and rice bowls. He had falafel, I had spicy beef and roasted veggies and both were amazing. The kids menu features only one item but it was a hit with my kids. The kids meal includes: a mini pita which choice of meat, choice of rice, carrots or pita chips, dipping sauce, & beverage. My kids gobbled up their meals, which is not typical unless it's macaroni and cheese or fries. It was a joy to watch them enjoy good, healthy food and try vegetables they normally wouldn't."}
{"text":"I have to say my boyfriend and I both enjoyed their bowls, but if you are looking for authentic Mediterranean food this is far from it. Definitely like the chipotle version of 'Mexican' food. The dips and spreads were quite unsatisfactory. The tzatziki wasn't a creamy consistency- more stiff. The eggplant and red pepper was our least favorite. The roasted red pepper hummus I buy from the store is better. The chicken was great but the falafels tasted very far from authentic. Service was good though"}
{"text":"This has turned into my new fave. I love the super greens, falafel and the eggplant spread is so yummy. There is always a line but it moves super fast. Also that Turmeric lime drink is the bomb"}
{"text":"THIS place. I've been waiting for a restaurant like this forEVAH!!! So happy to know they are opening one in Birkdale which is closer to my home. You choose from a variety of fresh greens, grains, beans, chopped vegetables to build your bowl or pita then choose your dressing and hummus. Everything is so fresh and delicious. I got the bowl and it was a pretty good size. I love it!! Will definitely be a regular here!!"}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place, and took someone here for his birthday dinner. Just the two of us. A little hard to find since it is hidden inside a building, so I would recommend you remember the address.  There is free parking in the garage if you enter in the back street.

We made a reservation for a birthday, but I was a little disappointed to be not greeted at the door.  There was no host, and after a few minutes, someone finally came by and took us to a seat in the corner. 

Overwhelmed by the assortment of food, we decided to go with the tasting menu. Unlike other tasting menus where you are charged per person for a set-course meal, the chef selects what's already on the menu to cook for you instead depending on how hungry you are and what you like. Thus, we decided to go for 5 different dishes and asked specifically to include a few of our own choices;

-Gamay-poached foie gras w/ pear mostardo: (5/5 stars)
I absolutely love foie and this is probably one of the best cold foie I've ever had. Definitely interesting (in a good way) w a hint of sweetness from poaching it in gamay.

-Smoked kingfish ceviche: (5/5)
Also love ceviche, pretty much as good as I've had anywhere else. Very good portion.

-Eggplant w/ queso fresco, honey, tomatillo sauce: (5/5)
Incredible! One of the best eggplant dishes ever! Lightly breaded, fried to perfection, light queso fresco cheese, in a mildy sweet and spicy honey and tomatillo sauce. Who would've thought?

-Veal Sweetbreads w/ radicchio-poblano, chile salad, walnut vinaigrette: (2/5)
It was ok. The sweetbreads itself was cooked well but I found that it lacked flavour, and slightly dry. On the other hand, the salad was delicious!

-Venison anticucho w/ warm red cabbage salad: (3/5)
Very good. But not spectacular, something a homecook could do. The flavour was similar to a chinese style bbq sauce (which I love). I guess I just expected a lot more excitement to come with this dish.

DESSERT- Chocolate and cheese plate: (5/5)
Loved it! Four different cheeses paired with four different types of herb-infused chocolates and breadsticks.  I can't quite remember what kinds they were but from memory, there was a whipped goat cheese (YUMM!). Chocolates included a dark chocolate infused with rosemary, milk chocolate with something, white chocolate with fennel, and something else... weird, I know. But, it all worked!!

Service: (4/5)
The gentleman who served us was very courteous and attentive; came over for multiple quality checks, and answered our questions patiently. My only criticism was that I requested that he suggested me a wine similar to either a malbec or a valpolicella.  However, what came was closer to what tasted like a merlot that has been opened for several weeks. I didn't complain though. I left him a great tip and he came by one last time just to thank us after.

The crowd seem to be a little pretentious, but worth sucking up.  Definitely bringing some more friends here... perhaps, i'll try their paella next time!"}
{"text":"Absolute trash for a tasting menu. Ate with a large group. Food was some of the lamest I've had in the whole city. 

Seafood, which is apparently their crown jewel, did not taste fresh. Tasting menu was a joke. Was just served dishes off the normal menu which isn't really how the tasting menu should work. Portions for our large group were laughably small. Did not get the impression this place had ever actually served a large group. 

Staff's attitude to some group members was less than satisfactory. Food is just so far off the mark I'd say go somewhere else. 

Gray gardens or Richmond station are a WAY better picks for price fix tasting menus."}
{"text":"So lunch times comes and the grumble in my stomach is louder than the thunder during a summer rain. So i decided to see what the fuss was about \"Cava\".  My friends know that I'm a foodie, but I was low key nervous. Said what the hell and shot my shot. So upon looking on the website after starving most of the morning.  I decided on a grain and green bowl, with white rice(which was cooked to perfection), chicken and lamb( cause I'm greedy) topped with the red humus, Harissa, and the the tasty feta with a peta on the side.  So placed my order with one of the friendly employees and under 5 minutes I was in and out.  Keep in mind I love hala food. So i get to my desk amazed by all the fresh colors coming from my plate or just being delusional from hunger.   Either way it was dope. When i took my first bite it blew me away. Seasoned beyond my imagination and my tastebuds are dancing with the excitement of what I just ate. Needless to say I'm in love and will be back again."}
{"text":"Random location a bit further down the road, but we are glad we found it. This tapas KILLED Patria. It makes me mad we even spent a dinner there when we could have had this. The artichoke and eggplant dishes were amazing. If you can stomach foie gras then you'll enjoy as well. The atmosphere was nice... Just what you'd expect from their location near a bunch of stores. However, it was unpretentious which I love."}
{"text":"Love everything they serve here! The ginger turmeric lemonade drink is my favorite. The service is fast and great..I love that you can order ahead."}
{"text":"Great prices and amazing flavors!!! I love that I can add as many toppings as I want, and it doesn't affect the price. I wish they had pre-determined bowl options because it's hard on an indecisive person."}
{"text":"Overpriced bland tasting Mediterranean food served 'lukewarm' ...
I had high expectations for this place after reading it was \"Yafo-like\" but more upscale
The servers were awesome and very pleasant but the food lacked taste! I paid $17 for dry chicken, brown rice, lentils and roasted veggies.. I guess the ONE meatball (with the texture of an old rubber band) and the soup justified this $17 meal. 
Needless to say I was not impressed and suggest you go to Yafo's for a better experience!
#disappointed
#notimpressed"}
{"text":"3.5 hours, 8 dishes, 4 glasses of vino later... INCROYABLE.  

Stand-out dishes:   

Jamón iberico
(as my Dove chocolate wrapper instructed 'ignore the price tag', so we did. oh YES.
proscuitto has nothing on you.)   

Pinchos of gamay-poached foie gras with prune plum chutney
(jaws dropped. pause. best EVER. period.) 

Smoked kingfish ceviche with a friseé salad
(yes! ceviche-streak is going strong) 

Eggplant with queso fresco, honey and tomatillo sauce
(surprise \"wow\" dish of the night)  

Honourable mentions:   

Torta of duck breast & anchovy
(first taste & \"Oooo, so good\" of the night)  

Forty-eight hour beef cheek with white pureé & chimchurri
(just slather & let melt)  

Braised oxtail tamal with pasilla chile sauce 
(10 pts for presentation)   

It pains, but easily forgettable:   

Chickpea morcilla
(\"if this was our least favourite, I can handle it.\")"}
{"text":"Loved the food, super fresh. Think Mediterranean chipotle but better! All ingredients laid out in front to choose from down the line.
The homemade juices are ahhhhhmazingggg! I had the strawberry mint mixed with the turmeric! 
For my dinner I had the grains/green bowl - my grains being lentils and the super greens, chicken/hummus and great toppings. Very filling I brought half my bowl home.
Hubby had the rice bowl/grilled meatballs with a pita on the side. 
Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner tonight at Cava. We started with a cava gin & tonic (with grapefruit juice!) and a Barcelona beer. Both good.

For dinner for two we had:
Warmed olives - very salty, but yummy
Squash blossom - so small, so perfect
Large plate Iberico ham - delicious
Ceviche - light and fresh
Eggplant - amazing
Sablefish - flaky and wonderful
Steak - good, but a bit chewy and the tomato sauce was interesting

Clean place. Excellent, attentive service. Women's washroom was clean but cramped with two women trying to pass one another.

Definitely worth repeating."}
{"text":"I do really enjoy this place. The Pinchus were amazing. The brussels sprouts were very good, not usually easy to do. The Jamon is a classic and we ordered only half a plate but had it with cheese which I highly recommend. The ceviche was also great.
We enjoyed a nice bottle of spanish wine. The booze markup was a bit higher than some other places, but it is Yonge Street midtown so there you go."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty great. must try their eggplant dish. it's a bit on the pricey side. 
the variety of tapas and dishes do not disappoint. Nice ambience for date or catching up with friends."}
{"text":"Used to eat at CAVA all the time when I lived in DC and was thrilled to see it was coming to Charlotte!  The food is super fresh and flavorful, but can still be healthy.  The wide range of options for building your own meal means you can eat there every day of the week and have something pretty different.  Can't wait for the other Charlotte-area locations to open!"}
{"text":"So excited to have CAVA in Charlotte!  Love being able to build our own bowls and try different flavors every time.  Everything is fresh and flavorful and they can accommodate lots of different diet types.  Will definitely be a staple!"}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try Cava for awhile and finally went the other week when we had friends in town. The food was all very good but portions were tiny - expected for a tapas restaurant, sure, but some of them were comically small. I had a pintxos to start, the croqueta of jamon, which was delicious but a bit of a stretch at $4. The meats and fish all seemed to be high quality, and there were some interesting flavour combinations. Interior of the restuarant is nice and service was good, too.  Overall a good evening, but I just don't think the value is there. I'll probably try another restaurant next time I'm in the mood for Spanish!"}
{"text":"Excellent food from top to bottom. Foie gras, ceviche, and sablefish were particularly spectacular."}
{"text":"The addiction is real. That is all. But seriously, fresh flavors that surprise and delight. There is so much to love you can't single out one thing. It combines into a piece of food artwork. Crunchy, sour, salty, spicy, savory, fresh goodness.

For what it's worth, here's what I get: super greens, brown rice, lentils, no protein, tzatziki, Harissa, eggplant hummus, radishes, pickled onions, cucumbers and tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, pita chips on top, cucumber dill. Insanely delicious. One bowl equals two meals for $12 including a side pita and large drink. YUM."}
{"text":"Good food, fresh and tasty. Pricey for add on's, making a lettuce & lentil bowl with meat more expensive than a sit down restaurants meals.  Pita bread was good and lamb meatballs are great, though again expensive."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with locally-sourced ingredients.  Chipotle-style build your own salads, grain bowls and pitas.  Must try."}
{"text":"Loved all the tapas except for the Octopus. Other than that, atmosphere (for being so far up north) and wait staff were great."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and finally tried it today. The pita bread was very good, the salad with the chicken was good too. However, it was hard to enjoy because there was so many FLIES EVERYWHERE in there it was disgusting! Flies crawling all over the toppings, meat, etc. Some of the toppings looked good but I couldn't get myself to get them because there were too many flies on them. And the employees in there were either completely used to them or didn't notice them because it didn't seem to phase them at all! I hope they can get the fly prob under control because I otherwise would have really enjoyed the place!"}
{"text":"Alicia helped me SO much to love this place! My first time here and I had NO idea how to build my plate. Alicia made all the suggestions while checking in with me per ingredient and I LOVED the bowl she built for me!!! So yummy!!! I SO wanted to love this place and because of Alicia.....I DO! Now that's what u call great customer service!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed CAVA. The dishes were unique and very tasty. I loved the king fish ceviche, the supergilda (grilled sardine crostata), and the Beef brisket. The bartender was great and when asked to make up a non-alcohol beverage it was great! It had orange blossom oil, a few other ingredients and some Bitters. I lived it so muh I asked for the same but with amaretto. It was great! 

I would definitely go again"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. SO GOOD. SO freakin good. Grain bowls are amazing. Full of flavor and will fill you up. You also get a pita on the side. Highly recommend, and will be coming back. Open more locations!"}
{"text":"Very fresh. Nice to have something different. A lot of combinations you can do. Kids even liked it."}
{"text":"A little overwhelming for a first timer. You can go for a salad, a grain bowl or a combo of greens and grains. After you settle on a base, you get to add dips, proteins, toppings and dressing. The toppings were all delicious and flavorful. I will say the rice was very plain on its own. The bowls come with a small pita; chewy with crispy edges. Shout out to awesome drink options. They sell spindrift sodas, chocolate and regular milk, lemonade and teas, and natural sodas! No Coke or Pepsi here, folks! Price was reasonable for the quality of food. I would come back to try a different combo. $24 for two with drinks."}
{"text":"I am so thankful that CAVA has come to the University area! We are in need of delicious restaurants. This fast casual spot is hip and fresh and delightful. You choose your base, sauce, protein, toppings, and sauce. Don't forget the pita. Don't stress about trying to choose what tastes the best together, it will all taste amazing together. My husband and I really loved the lamb meatballs and falafel. They were both very moist and seasoned just right. We met the manager and he was very attentive in making sure we had everything we needed. We came at the end of the night but I wish they had cleaned up the drink area a little more. That being said- their soda fountain is all Maine root soda with organic cane sugar. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Finding it really hard to find a good Tapas bar in Toronto, which is my favourite style of eating so that's been unfortunate.

This place was recommended by a friend, but it was a huge fail. The wine recommended by our waiter wasn't good, and we didn't have one dish that was above average. We had about six-seven courses and it was all tasteless and over priced food. Our bill came to about $200, which was such a waste of money, I could have had fast food and enjoyed my meal more. Luckily I was in lovely company which was the saving grace to the evening."}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening. Loved the service, the ambiance and the food. We had the tasting menu in which we had five different dishes and two different kinds of deserts. I didn't like the duck and the Apple pie  much rest everything else was fantastic."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto. The flavour on every dish are always so balanced. This will be my 5th time here and I have never been disappointed. Sometimes I think I should stop trying new places and just eat everyday."}
{"text":"We came for our anniversary, they offered us the \"we serve you\" option and we enjoyed their tapas selection with a bottle of Spanish wine. The meal was a bit pricey, although we knew upfront the price range.
We had a great time, thanks guys"}
{"text":"So glad I gave this place a try!!! My fellow foodie friend recommended It once It opened but the menu was so strange to me that I opted out. Until today. Boy, am I glad she convinced me to go!!! 
I chose the bowl with saffron rice. I didn't recognize the little black bead looking grains so I didn't add them. In case you're interested, they are lentils. 
To my bowl, I chose lamb meatballs, feta and tzatziki spread, veggie toppings and a side of lemon herb tahini. It's served with a warm pita bread. My first bite was so good - pretty sure my shoulders did an involuntary boogie dance in joy. Everything complimented the other. I asked for a couple falafel balls, just to try them out. They are so not what you'd expect! There's a certain distinct flavor that i can't seem to figure out - whatever it is, i like it! The chickpeas weren't ground to a pulse like the traditional falafel. Instead, there a whole pieces of chickpeas. This was a great surprise as the chunks gave a nice texture to what is usually a mushy ball of chickpeas. The best part of the meal are the sauces. Tear off a chunk of pita and dip it into any one of the sauces in your bowl or in a side of dressing of your choice - it's as addictive as the free chips and salsa you get at Mexican restaurants. I didn't venture out too much since this was my first taste but now I will be sure to try a little of everything!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the community day, the day before the official opening. 

Cava has the right idea with the preview day. I was able to try what they have to offer and see the variety they have.

The wait to order wasn't bad and I don't anticipate there being long lines once they officially open. All of the staff and employees were super nice and helpful. 

I appreciated that a lot of the ingredients are locally sourced and they seem to really care about their food. 

I ordered the half greens/half grain bowl. I was able to try 3 of the proteins (spicy lamb meatball, meatball and the lamb). The spicy lamb meatball was my favorite. I picked all of the topping items I like like pickled onions, feta cheese and their cauliflower quinoa tabbouleh. But I think what really made the bowl was the dips/spreads. I got the  eggplant and red pepper, the roasted red pepper hummus and the crazy feta. The three mixed so well together. 


Cava is kinda far from my side of town but I will def have to take a drive up that way for this tasty treat. Can't wait til they open one in the Park Road around around July 2018!!!

{"text":"I've really wanted to try Cava a while back, but a few failed attempts at making reservations later, it's been on my back burner ever since.  Recently, my friend told me that it was one of his favourites and took me there.  

I like how the location of the restaurant is tucked away inside a building a Yonge street -- convenient yet away from the hustle and bustle of the main road.  Seeing it was my first time there, the waiter explained that their dishes were tapas style meant for sharing and that 6 - 8 were good for a party of two.  So here is what we ordered:  jamon croquetas, scallops, jamon iberico, 48 hour braised brisket, beef tripe, \"supergilda\", pincho of foie gras, and the baked alaska.  The jamon croquetas was a dish like no other I've tried before; it has crispy croquetas on top of a bed of vegetable with snails and there were four massive mushrooms around the plate.  It tasted great but a little puzzling to someone with my limited culinary exposure to spanish cuisine.  I was very impressed by the scallops -- they were the size of babys' fists and perfectly cooked.  If this were a restaurant were located on King West, just one of those suckers would probably cost $20.  Do I really need to say anything about the jamon iberico?  Maybe just one word -- it was beyond!  The brisket was good but I don't think I enjoyed it as much as my friend.  Make no wrong it was as good as a braised brisket can get, but I like my brisket salty, briny, and hopefully between two pieces of white rye.  The standout of that dish for me was the white puree; oh my god, it was so smooth like a baby's bottom (hmm... two baby body part references in one review -- getting a little creepy).  I wanted to try the beef tripes because I've never had any non-Asian preparation of the dish.  The tripes were perfectly tender without being mushy and retained the innards' unique flavour; suffice to say, it did not taste like wet dog at all but was still \"tripy\".  The pinchos were great, so much flavour in one bite.  I'm glad we got the foie and \"supergilda\" (which is a pincho of sardine, olive, and pepper) because they were very different in flavour; they really opened our palates for the rest of the meal.  For dessert, we had baked Alaska;  the pistachio thing in the middle had a really rich nutty flavour which was balanced by the fluffy cream and poached pear.  We were both stuffed after these dishes -- even though portions were small they were all quite decadent.

I really enjoyed this meal at Cava because I was truly eating with my mouth and not with my eyes.  All the dishes were very hearty and satisfying.  There wasn't even one piece of microgreen in the entire meal; can u believe that? ( Not that I don't love microgreens, they do make everything looking more fresh.)  Even though our dinner was not cheap, it was worth it merely for the quality of the level of preparation of the ingredients.  Cava is a great place to go if you love to try a wide variety of dishes in on mean and are someone who regards dining as a social event rather than a necessary function."}
{"text":"overrated, mediocre food. nothing special. extremely overpriced. and its impossible to find the location."}
{"text":"Tapas?  small, but exquisite dishes everyone can share or devour themselves?  Lovin it!  so does this mean TAPAS = DIMSUM?  Must be, but with a spanish twist.

I've been there 4-5 times and every time it has been just as good if not better.  Let's start off with drinks!  Sangria, their extensive wine list are great choices, but if you want a real palate cleanser with a jolt of flavour, may I suggest their GIN & TONIC.  Sounds very basic (and a very typical english drink) but don't be fooled.  I cannot recall the type of gin they use, but ask them for the GT with their in-house made tonic water!  Incredible and you'll be ordering more of those throughout the night.

As you read the other reviews, they all speak the truth when it comes their signature dishes.  Be warned, it has a seafood tone and you must love seafood.  The supergilda is a must and don't be afraid of the fillet you find on top.  Since this is a Spanish restaurant, you must order the JAMON IBERICO.  The huge animal leg you see on their bar counter is where this dish comes from.  the quality, taste and texture rivals any Iberico you may find in Barcelona (and I know, I've visited Barcelona twice).  Ask your server what they would recommend as they have all tasted and tried the dishes there and can give you an honest opinion.  Every time I go there for dinner I order 6-7 dishes and ask them to bring them out in rounds.  

My MAIN suggestion for food there will and always be (hands down) the ROASTED SABLEFISH WITH BLACK RICE AND COLLARD GREENS!  If you're with another person or a table full of people, warn them and say that you will NOT BE SHARING THIS DISH.  As humble as the items on the dish is, the execution of all three on the same plate makes it an incredible joyride for your palate.  You will not be disappointed in paying $30 for this dish.  End off with this sablefish as well.

CAVA gets my 5-star not only because of their dishes, but also their service and the ambiance they bring to each table.

I stand corrected. DIMSUM=TAPAS!"}
{"text":"I went to this place because it was listed in blgoTO as one of the top ten wine bars in Toronto. 

I went Friday night with at 8pm with a friend, we didn't have reservations. This seemed to put the staff off a bit, but they gave us a table. But then when our server came and we said we just wanted wine, there was an awkward pause and weirdness from the server  who said tables are for people that want to eat. It was a bit uncomfortable. He went to ask if it was ok that we had a table and then came back and asked us if we wouldn't mind sitting at the bar. (The bar sits maybe 8 people max)

So we were moved to the bar. From here the service was good and they have a good wine selection. But since its seems quite difficult to go here and just have a few glasses of wine I would not classify this as a wine bar. Its a restaurant with a good wine selection.

I looked at the menu and its too meat intensive and not enough veg options for me.

The atmosphere and vibe of this place is great though, so if they don't give me a hassle I might try to go back for some wine."}
{"text":"Food is ok. I expected more flavour or at least visual aspect. Price is similar to bar Isabel or patria but portions seems to be smaller and flavour seems to lack that wow factor. Very small portion and for the price, (and yes I know it's tapas..)Service was lacking too where in we have to track our servers down quiet too often.  Thank god  popeye's was outside."}
{"text":"Cava is outstanding. We were running late for our reservation on a saturday night, and they still kindly sat us 30mins after! Started off with the pincho of gamay-poached foie gras and supergilda. There was so much flavour!! Followed by the ceviche, fried eggplant and smoked pork jowel. The hazelnut spread really added a nice twist to the pork jowel. An intimate spot for a date, very impressed! The crowd here was a bit older (30-40yr+) compared to tapas in downtown."}
{"text":"The bartender/ waiter was great! He knew the menu like the back of his hand, made us cocktails that weren't on the menu yet.  Those were delicious!  We asked him to pick the food for us!  I think it was a wise choice, it was easier and he knew what he was talking about!  We were three and had around 7 dishes, I suggest to get a little bit more ( or maybe we were just starving)!  Overall, great ambiance, great food, great drinks!"}
{"text":"some dishes are tasty (roasted sablefish). some dishes are a real letdown (paella). having tried almost every item on the menu, the dishes are generally over-seasoned imo. 

however, when you factor in the size and the price, it's just not good value. perhaps their client-base are wealthy individuals from around the neighborhood and used to paying up. however, i personally wouldn't make a special trip here. 

the décor is okay. the service is attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends for tapas and wine.  Everything we ordered was absolutely excellent!  Quiet and small location, great for a low key evening out."}
{"text":"First time to Cava, walked in unsure of what we wanted. But as soon as we saw all the beautiful colorful food we were star struck. Decisions seemed easy, because everything looked amazing. 

I got the grains and salad bowl, with arugula (sourced in North Carolina) and Romain.  For the grains I got the beautiful black lentils and saffron rice. Then you get three choices of dips, I chose the hummus, tzatziki, and harissa. For protein, the falafel and the chicken. At the toppings sections I got EVERYTHING, the pickled onions were amazing. Topped with the Yogurt dill sauce and a wedge of pitta. We also tried the Ginger Turmeric Juice, very refreshing. 

Absolutely a beautiful, healthy, and delicious meal, definitely worth the price. Everything was prepared with love. I doubt you can go wrong here, it all looked delectable. And you could tell the servers were happy serving you such quality food. A wonderful experience! :)"}
{"text":"It is in a dingy food court. Such an odd place for a restro that's decent. But the food was good. Enjoyed the sable fish particularly. Don't do the trust me menu, though. I no longer trust you cava. The desert you picked for me was so fattening and not even good... Order for yourself and you should have a good time."}
{"text":"I would consider myself a health conscious person so when I break my normal eating habits I tend to go for what I crave and what I crave is Spanish food. I am a massive proponent of the mix between spicy pork and fish which we see so often in Spanish cooking. I caught the bug from a young age when I would go to Spain and eat all the food other kids would call \"icky\" That bug has never left me and I still crave crispy potatas bravas, iberico jamon and octopus, lots of octopus. Living in a city like Toronto it was never easy to find exquisite Spanish food that would cause me to recall the fond memories of my childhood, that was, until I attended Cava. Cava, named after the Spanish sparkling wine that seems to be served in Spain from 11:00 am until 11:00 am the next day! In an unassuming alleyway off of Yonge street lies a modern, chic, pocket of Spain. Seeing the wine bottles lining the wall, the opulent brown wood lining the restaurant and the hanging light fixtures, you know you are in the right place for tapas. I went with my entire family and ate nearly everything on the menu, my favorites being the octopus that was grilled to perfection, the iberico jamon sliced fresh to order and French fries which are extremely herbaceous and unique. Those dishes accompanied by some of their extravagant wines offered by their sommelier is absolutely perfect on a warm summer evening. I truly believe that this is one of the few restaurants in Toronto where you can still get authentic Spanish food just like you would at Boqqueria in Barcelona with a more sophisticated vibe. I will be returning again as soon as I return from LA."}
{"text":"We had such a fantastic experience here I had to share. I can't decide which was better - the service or the food.

The staff was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable, raising our dinner to a lovely experience.

The food was delicious and thoughtful - we left satisfied but eager to come back and try more.

Highlights were the ham, the croquettes, eggplant, lamb and the duck (though there were no misses).

Deserts were rich and delicious with everyone raving about the churros (crispy and light with a great crunch).

Can't say enough good about Cava."}
{"text":"This place...
Oooohhh this place...

Y'all this place is a true foodies dream. If you like complex but complimentary flavors, fresh quality ingredients that is still a great value. 

Lots of people have said this place has a chipotle-like concept. That may be true to some but this would definitely be a more elevated version to me fir the complexity and variety of flavors, fresh ingredients and the variety of offerings. 

I heard good things and was excited to try the falafel . When I arrived I asked how long ago the falafel was made. The kind gentleman offered me to sample it to make sure it was what I wanted AND said he's make a fresh batch for me if so, though it would take 6 minutes. 

I perused the menu (and some Yelp reviews) while I waited and was ready to roll when my falafel was done. 

I ended up ordering the grains and greens bowl with rice, lentils, all of the greens, eggplant spread, crazy feta, harissa, falafel, all of the condiments and the lemon herb tahini dressing. All of this was served with the mini pita and I added the ginger turmeric tonic to drink.  

The staff were all super kind and helpful and gave their suggestions along the way which I gladly accepted and implemented (I mean they are the experts!!) 

I sat down and took my pictures and then my first bite. It was AMAZINGLY delicious. I absolutely cannot brag enough on the melding of flavors, the freshness of ingredients, and the value for the money. I still had good amount of food left and was full when I finished. It was the epitome of satisfying. I can't even qualify it with words. The finer turmeric tonic is the ultimate refreshing beverage and perfect for digestion (ginger, turmeric and citrus). 

Knowing what I know now this is what I'll change next time:
-Salad bowl or just little bit of the grains (super filling with both).  
-All crazy feta dip with a tiny bit of harissa (the crazy feta is divine and the harissa is delish but best served sparingly because it's really harissa not some knockoff stuff). 
-A large ginger turmeric tonic (this stuff is divine) and should be bottled and sold like their dips. 

Love Cava and I've already been spreading the word off Yelp!

{"text":"super impressed!!!  it was our first visit.    the front line guys were very patient and informative  in assisting us with the process and all the options.    Nothing was a big deal.    we could swap this for thatbone vicea versa.   Staff was great.   Oh now to the food.  it was easily enough food to have left over and so fresh and tasteful.     well definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant as I heard that it was pretty good.

The atmosphere is dimly lit and smelled like rank seafood upon entry. They were quite busy. There was a time limit on our table and we didn't end up ordering dessert or coffee because we were almost out of time.

The food was pretty mediocre and somewhat overpriced for the serving size at this Spanish tapas restaurant. The dishes were Spanish- and Latin American-inspired, the server said.

The wine was ok but somewhat hyped up. Based on my wine experience I'd probably never buy a Spanish wine at the LCBO. There was a pretty extensive wine list featuring wines from Spain. The waiter seemed to think highly of the tempranillo we ordered but I was somewhat disappointed. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either.

Beef brisket left much to be desired. The beet salad was totally a joke (4 slices of beet, covered in chopped parsley or some other tasteless green). Squid was pretty good. Corn tamal had very cute presentation but was super small once you broke into it and tasted bland. I'm sure we had a few other dishes but they left such an impression that I can't remember what they were!

The server spoke explicitly to my dining companion, facing him only. Maybe he thought I didn't want to hear the answers to any of the questions we asked. Well, I didn't hear much as it's hard to hear someone when they somewhat have their back to you. I found this somewhat rude.

All dishes were bland and lacked flavour. Underwhelming and expensive.

I wouldn't come back and I can't recommend it. There are much better restaurants out there at that price point. I wouldn't go back of my own volition."}
{"text":"I love tapas style portions because it allows you to taste many different types of dishes. Most of the dishes that were served to us tasted too salty. For the price, we expected the food to taste better. 
 For 2 people, our bill came up to $190 with tax and tip.  

The service was great, which is why I gave it 2 stars versus 1.  
Will not be going back, especially considering that there are so many better tasting restaurants at a lower price"}
{"text":"The concept of the restaurant is amazing and pretty much similar to Yafo in Southpark. I was very excited to have this type of restaurant open up near the university. There are many options to choose from, grain bowl or salad bowl. Tons of delicious options to add. However the flavors were lacking. No this could be because of my options but when I eat at Yafo I'm blowing away. 

I will give them another chance. Very clean restaurant, staff was friendly and helpful. I think they will do every well here."}
{"text":"I've loved CAVA in the past and while I'm hoping there are a few kinks that may work out as far as flow of this new location goes, the food was as stand up as I've experienced in the past! I enjoy the falafel, the grains and greens mix... and their sauces!!"}
{"text":"This place was unbelievably good. Fresh ingredients as well as awesome menu items like spicy lamb meatballs. The sauces were delicious and I like the fact they have non traditional soft drinks like main root sodas and house made.  concoctions. Price was reasonable and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent customer service. Great location.
I recently went there with some friends and i was so impressed with the food at Cava that I bought my best friend 2 nights after. My friend and i loved the rice and the delicious cod, to die for!
Now this restaurant is my second favourite in the whole city of Toronto."}
{"text":"I LOVE MEDITERRANEAN!  Maybe because I am originally from that region, but I LOVE IT when a new Mediterranean spot opens in town....and an amazing one at that!  The grain and greens bowl was delicious.  You must try the back lentils, and their rice was OMG!  The best protein in my opinion was the lamb meatballs.  and I pretty much got every topping added to my bowl.  You definitely will not go wrong with choosing the spicy harissa sauce for the grand finale, but all of those sauces are great additions.  I have been waiting for this spot to open and finally made it in this weekend for lunch...I will most definitely be a regular going forward.  (Follow me @ #foodievida on Facebook and Instagram for more of my foodie adventures)."}
{"text":"What an amazing meal! Came here for dinner and everything on the menu looked so good that I decided to let the chef cook for us. We had a 10 course meal with wine pairing shared between four people and even though they were tapas, I was so full after the meal. 

We had their chicken liver and foie gras mousse with toasted hand-made bread, roasted cauliflower, oyster mushrooms with black garlic mustard, eggplant with queso fresco, roasted sablefish (my favourite dish), venison antichucho, duck breast, supergilda, ceviche, and smoked pork jowl.

Everything was delicious and elegant here. Flavours are incomparable and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"What just happened today!! 
I am kind of a fan of CAVA , I have been eating here since 2 years right from Jersey City, NJ. Now, at Charlotte,NC though I have been visiting here for few times often for a takeout , today it was a surprise. One of the persons, who made the bowl for me gave this bowl for FREE!! She says, \"your total charges are $0.00\". I was wondering that she was kidding me, and offered my credit card. Here she goes that it is paid by them. I did ask so many questions to her that, \"does she know me? Is there some discount going on?\"(just blabbering curiously to know why, since no one ever buys me food for free unless it's my friend or a family).Finally,  It seems they randomly choose one person. 

Since I had a long day , this did make my day today! I am so sorry , I should have known your name. :) 
Thanks again, CAVA grill! Impressed with this kind of move. 

On this note, one suggestion. A points based card by CAVA would be wonderful. This way , for regulars like me can get more free bowl/ lemonade / credits. Etc.,"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Fresh ingredients. Not a huge selection of soups. Same ordering style as chipotle. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"What a great place.  A little pretentious? Yes. Worth sucking it up? Yes.

Everything we had was tasty.  Smoked kingfish ceviche- awesome.  Eggplant- awesome.  Edamame bruschetta- awesome.  Lamb- awesome.  Truffle desserts- awesome.

Plates came out based sorta like courses, and when we got to our \"mains\" we got new dishes and everything.  They were never pushy and we could take our time and had an enjoyable meal- something a little out of the ordinary, well worth it."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. The food is great, the people are nice, it's really chill vibe. The bowl is much healthier than other places so that's definitely a plus. It's cheap for such a big portion."}
{"text":"I was at Cava once before and had a very memorable meal. This time around, I was quite disappointed. Overall the meal here was not a bad one. But it wasn't very good either. We didn't get a good value for our money, and the only flavour for the food was salt, salt and more salt. Cava is said to be one of the better tapas restaurants in town, and over the years it has received good reviews. It may be that they are resting on their laurels. But, they better start picking up their game if they want to maintain their clientele base.

\"SUPERGILDA\" 
- Price: $5
- Rating: 2/5
- The dish came highly recommended by the waitress, only to disappoint.
- Consists of a single crouton covered with a small slice of sardine, but ruined with the addition of a toothpick skewering a couple of olives and an anchovy. It was a very 1980's presentation and the flavour was salt on top of salt on top of more salt.

CROQUETA OF JAMÓN WITH CAPER-SULTANA SAUCE
- Price: $4
- Rating: 1/5
- Thumb-sized croquet tasted OK, but was very little value for your hard-earned money.

CHICKEN LIVER & FOIE GRAS MOUSSE WITH TOASTED HOUSE-MADE BREAD AND ACCOMPANIIMENTS
- Price: $13
- Rating: 4/5
- Very tasty, silky smooth mousse.
- Not a very large portion.

JAMON SERRANO
- Price: $17
- Rating: 4/5
- Nice ham, descent portion

PAPAS FRITAS 
- Price: $7.50
- Rating: 5/5
- Amazing fries!  These fries alone salvaged the meal!

EGGPLANT WITH QUESO FRESCO, BONITO, & TOMATILLO SAUCE
- Price: $12
- Rating: 3/5
- Nice dish, the bonito flakes add a nice accent.

PAELLA
- Price: $65
- Rating: 2/5
- The chicken was nice, but not plentiful (only 2 quarter legs)
- The clams were dry
- The shrimp was nice
- There was very little rice and it was  VERY salty, almost un-edible.
- Overall, a salty unsatisfying EXPENSIVE dish.

TAJINE OF LAMB WITH QUINOA, AND ROASTED OKRA
- Price: $23
- Rating: 1/5
- There were only small traces of lamb meat, which was dry and salty
- The okra was extra slimy - no effort to reduce the slime
- The dish was not presented in a tajine, which is kind of the main point.

I ordered a Tempranillo which they ran out of. They highly recommended an alternative at a higher price. But it turns out it was a blend with only 1/3 Tempranillo and wasn't very good.

The service was overall good."}
{"text":"First timer! Very good food and staff was informative and friendly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"SO pleased with CAVA!! We went last night and we were just amazed with the quality of flavor in everything. First you start out with a base. I did the greens and grains and they have a greens wall where you can pick which greens you want in your bowl and two types of rice to choose from. This bowl comes with a pita which I really appreciated. Then you pick dips and spreads (up to three). Between my boyfriend and I, we tried all the spreads. Our favorite was the Crazy Feta and if you like a little kick the Harissa. Then you pick your protein, you can do one or do half and half. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and pick the braised lamb. Lord, was it juicy and flavorful. I did half lamb and half falafel. I felt like the falafels were very hearty and not dry. Then after that you can pick your toppings and dressings. I did the spicy lime tahini and sriracha Greek yogurt. 

In hindsight we got our dressings on top of our bowls but it looked so amazing that we just mixed it all together and so we couldn't tell what was what but either way it was so yummy. Also, it could have been an ILLUSION but the \"To-go\" bowls looked like they got more food than to stay bowls so we talked about getting the to-go bowls next time and just eating there."}
{"text":"Not sure from where to start but I have to start from somewhere. I have heard about this place and read a lot of good reviews so decided to go there and check it out. I didn't know what to expect but everything exceeded my expectation  except for one thing, you will know at the end. I was confused what to order and the chef there said he can custom the dishes and make them smaller so I can try different ones which for me was amazing I never had this offer in any other restaurant. They served half portion of the salad, half portion of the octopus and the sardine which is a small portion. I wasn't that hungry but I enjoyed every bite, the salad was amazing the pistachio gave it an amazing taste and crunch. Eventhough it was half size but it was filling. The octopus was perfectly done the combination of the flavours were amazing, the olive the sauce the octopus; very well done. So back to what didn't meet my expectation; if they give you a cookie when tbey bring your check, don't eat it, it will take away all the good flavors that you just ate, put it aside or take it home, for me it didn't taste good."}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Saturday night. Despite the fact that when I called to make a reservation earlier that day they told me no walk-in tables would be available (rather rudely I might add), we were promptly seating when we arrived at 8:30.

And yes, the place is busy. And the guests are packed in as tight as can be, I was practically bumping elbows with the next table. It is very loud - like shout across the table loud - so you hear every conversation around you and everyone will be privvy to yours. 

The menu is extensive, and while I love a large selection, quite honestly I would recommend they take their 3-5 slowest movers off the list. We had:

Fois gras-amazing and still thinking about it.
Warm olives-well, it's a small bowl of small, warm, marinated olives.
Edamame and tomato bruschetta-very nice, unique, the tomatoes on this added a sweetness that broke through to add flavour to an otherwise bland-ish bean
Beef brisket-kinda meatloaf-y and not my favourite, was expecting something different
Local greens-unexpectedly good
Eggplant-really yummy, but isn't anything when it is breaded and deep fried?
Corn tortilla-meh, but then again, we didn't actually order it. It ended up on our table by the waiter's error (couldnt read his own writing). It also ended up on our bill which I was a bit annoyed about, but he did offer us a comp glass of wine (which I wouldn't have ordered but accepted anyway).
Charcuterie: would not order this again. Didn't enjoy the meat selection and have been way too spoiled with superior charcuterie at other places. Though, chicken pate/mousse was really tasty.

All in all, not regretful we went, enjoyed a unique meal, but will unlikely return. Too many other fantastic places to try!!"}
{"text":"Finally, it's open and didn't disappoint.  We recently moved from the DC area and absolutely love Cava.  So happy they opened a restaurant 5 miles from home.  Food and service was excellent and on par with or experience in the DC area.  Cava is a healthier option to the local Viva chicken chain in Charlotte.  A lighter fare without too much spice.  We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"The service was attentive, the interior is very nice, and most of the food was good.

Why only 3 stars?

Egregiously overpriced & tiny portions (even for tapas):  $4 for one thimble-sized croquetta (I'm not exaggerating), $16 for one skewer of venison, $12 for a side plate of brussel sprouts, etc.

In other words, the restaurant is nice and the food is fine, but it's not worth $100 per person...especially, when you're still hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"Cava is a cozy, modern tapas restaurant hidden in a pedestrian alcove off the main road. We went here on the recommendation of a local friend and it was a wonderful dining experience ... definitely some of the best tapas we've ever had. Lucas, our server, was very helpful as we were unfamiliar with the dishes. He orchestrated our dinner based on our tastes and what was popular at the restaurant. Everything was delicious! There are endless dining places to try in Toronto but this place was so good that I need to make another visit on a future trip."}
{"text":"Foie gras mousse... honestly the best."}
{"text":"Let's see...where do I begin? After years of intending to try this place, I finally did and all I have to say is - thank god there are better Spanish places in Toronto these days. The service was impossibly slow - there were only 5 other tables seated too. The Jamon Iberico was dry as hell - waste of $30. The croquettes at $5 is a rip off. Actually, the whole menu is a bit of a rip off. Octopus was ok, took 20 additional minutes after we finished the last plate were served and finished. The server was extremely polite and apologized for the wait but we must have been eating for at least an hour already, the restaurant wasn't busy so it really shouldn't have taken that long. It also came out like warm. Speaking of which, everything tastes stale - especially the bread. I applaud the restaurant for being one of the first Spanish taps restaurants in Toronto but feel it's a remnant of the old school - tiny tiny plates at extremely high prices. (Yes, I know it's a tapas restaurant but I feel some of you will know what I mean by this statement.) The only good thing I'll say about this place is that they actually have Txacoli which is rare in Toronto. Lastly, ordered the churros  and once again, it came out cold and tasted very stale - like it was fried 30 mins prior to serving. Sorry guys, I wanted to love this place but it's just not up to par."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place that's healthy, vegan-friendly, and fresh do not look any further. Cava is so delicious, I don't even feel like I'm eating \"healthy\". It's Mediterranean style but with all the options available you can really get creative. The set up is like chipotle in the sense where you start on one end and then start going down the line and choosing what you want to add to your plate. You can make different combinations of Salads, grains, protein, vegetables, and sauces. They also have yummy pita bread. Im hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"We came for a birthday celebration last Sunday.  We ordered 11 tapas items and and 2 desserts for sharing.  We are no expert of Latin food; but all dishes were bold in flavours.  Our favourites were the papas fritas, corn tamal with mushrooms, eggplant with queso fresno, beet salad with kale, grilled salmon and the 2 desserts.  We cared less about the chicken liver with foie gras as well as the kingfish ceviches.  We were divided about the pincho of valdeon with sherry-roasted figs.  Half the table loved it, the other half found the blue cheese too strong (I am among the first half).

The services were exceptional: attentive, efficient, effective, polite, friendly, elegant without being arrogant.  I felt like an honoured guest even though I was in jeans.  

The wine menu lasts 18 pages, and you may check it out online ahead of time.  You can bring your own wine.  The corkage fee is $15 for Sunday, and $30 for other days.  We brought our own wine, and they nicely decanted it for us.

This restaurant offers nice food and superb services.  It can be expensive, but it is perfect as an event restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding. Fantastic food (the jamón Joselito was an absolute treat) and service was truly impeccable. One of the best and most memorable dining experiences all three of us have had on any continent.

Food just kept getting better with each dish brought out. Rapini was delicious (especially the queso fresco with saffron and honey). Eggplant was fascinating. Brussels sprouts divine. Jamón out of this world. Paella delectable. Pork jowl perfect. Not strictly traditional but the quality of the ingredients and the execution was second to none.

We were initially brought here by the free corkage on Sundays, but the menu turned out to be truly superb. Even so, the service from both our server as well as everyone else at the restaurant was truly the highlight of the event.

This will be an absolute go-to every time we are in Toronto. Well done, gents."}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriends birthday.  The food looked absolutely amazing however, we were just passing by for a beverage.  The bartender really knew what he was doing.  I wouldn't say that we are cocktail connoisseurs, but we really love making and enjoying a nice cocktail.  Service was a bit slow but it was very busy for a Wednesday.  We ordered four Old Fashioned's and they were amazing!!  The price is rather steep and because of that we wont make this a regular spot.  Other than that, amazing!"}
{"text":"All u can say is OMG in soooooo in love!! So fresh, so good!!! They also have organic soda, I feel super healthy and full when I eat here"}
{"text":"Full and happy. 

CAVA is a great addition to the University area. They are right next to the Dunkin' Donuts and there is plenty of parking. Bathrooms are off on the side and are single occupant. 

Like many others have mentioned, CAVA is a build your own joint. They offer bowls, salads, and pitas. I went with the salad. Down the line we went and I added braised lamb (extra charge), sauces, and veggies. Every meal comes with a mini pita. I went with the red roasted pepper hummus. My salad totaled about $12. 

My salad was soooo good. Everything just tasted fresh. The portion size was huge and they were not stingy with the lamb. The hummus was delicious. The only downside is that I wish some of the veggies were better seasoned.

My coworker got a bowl with the yellow rice and she loved it. She also tried out some of the juice blends and didn't care for them. 

Overall, I can see myself stopping by frequently. CAVA makes \"clean\" eating fun."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   

Totally customizable grain/green bowls that you can make as healthy, or not, as you want!

When you get in line, they ask you what kind of \"base\" you would like.  You can choose grains, greens, a combination, a pita, mini pitas or sometimes there are a few other options.  Definitely take a look at the menu online before you arrive to get an idea of what you may like.   Then you choose a  dip/spread or three (I choose hummus) and next you pick your protein - you can do half and half of something!    Then you can add unlimited \"toppings\" that include things like tomatoes, cucumbers, slaw, quinoa, and many more!  Last, you pick a dressing, but I found that I didn't even need one!   I just used a lemon to add a little more flavor.

I ended up ordering a greens and grains bowl with brown rice and romaine, hummus, chicken, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, quinoa and a little bit of lemon juice.  It was delicious.   

It's a great option for vegetarians, vegans, those on special diets, etc.   

Have been twice in one month!  Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Cava for years but it's taken a long time for me to actually go. Part of the reason is that it's quite pricey, and having visited Spain, I feel deeply that good tapas shouldn't have to cost an arm and a leg.  

But in the end, I was glad that I finally tried Cava. The food was really really fantastic! We started off with some delicious pinchos- my favourite was definitely the foie gras. It really packed a great punch of flavour. Other highlights included the roast Brussel sprouts with black garlic and charred octopus. The one thing that I would actually recommend skipping is the paella. It wasn't bad, but I didn't think it was worth the $65 price tag. I'd rather spend that money on a couple of other tapas. 

All in all, I really enjoyed the dinner experience at Cava, but I'm not so sure I will be coming back very soon as it is quite pricey. I'd recommend it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance, it feels formal yet flexible and inviting.  It is easy to connect to both to the space and to who you are with.

The tapas were good but I was hoping for more.  I love ceviche and while the option on the menu was solid it wasn't spectacular.  Overall I enjoyed what we ordered but  I find it difficult to recall it several days letter.  It didn't really stand out.  For the steep price, I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"Took my family for a special dinner and wow we got it! Specializing in Spanish dishes with subtle flavors we had a delicious meal, meat and cheese plate, eggplant with tomatillos, pork jowl, paella, basque cake and chocolate crema with candied peanuts. Great service in a classy setting. Lots of talent flowing from the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've been over 20 times since they opened. The food is always fresh and the staff is friendly.  CAVA is no a staple fast-cas spot for me!"}
{"text":"Yum! Service was great and food is delicious and healthy.  We all tried the mini pita because we weren't super hungry and it ended up being the perfect choice. Will be returning on my next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people are giving 4 or 5 stars to this place. First of all, the food are not authentic at all. Flavors are either way too salty or plain. Also, the service is unbelievably slow. Neither I nor my friends were impressed."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Spicy lamb meatballs are to die for!! Fresh veggies, great hummus... great ambience !! Would come back later today for dinner!!!"}
