{"text":"I don't know, there's something missing here. The sandwich is kind of on par with the rest, but I don't know, maybe their ingredients are too fresh - something's off. Maybe it's the lack of nudy pictures on the wall, or lack of Italians arguing, or doing coke in the back, or honest food photography that makes it all look gross but relatable. It just lacks a certain level of personality."}
{"text":"I don't why so many ppl come here and complain about bs things. Your on queen street where half the options are a dump and food crap ! 

Food is 10/10 yes they had a few hiccups when they opened but I've seen a change in the past 3 weeks ! I'm a truck driver and travel all over Ontario I eat out all the time - all the time !!!!! I have stopped at all their locations.  Awesome Job to the ppl keep it going and as for the ppl, reading this site don't listen to the bs comments go trying support your neighbours !"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were high. I took the AAA steak one and it was just ok. Also I asked for tomato which I was charged with 0,49 for ONE slice of it. In total I paid 9,76. For this money I would probably choose another place to go."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. We ordered the veal sandwich and the meat ball one. My favorite was the later. They make the spicy factor to order. The buns are yummy and soak all the flavors from the sauce and meat really nicely. I would go back right away!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a chicken sandwich from here over lunch today. Chicken was mis-cooked in certain areas, leaving half of the sandwich inedible. 

I know it's a little thing, but forgot to add cheese after ensuring I paid for it (as in, made sure to point it out). 

Honestly, order from Cali Sandwiches if it's an option or maybe try a different location, otherwise give this puppy a pass and take gander over to some of the other places along Queen in this area.

Boo-urns."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken grilled sandwich.  It was fantastic.  Loved the tomato sauce and the right amount of kick because of the jalapeño inside that I had asked them to put.  The sandwich is quite big and filling.  Around $10."}
{"text":"The original just like the days in East York...
If you like a classic veal or chicken the Italian way this is it...come get it. Pizza is solid as well, YUM!"}
{"text":"Great mini-sandwiches for $4.75. They are normal sandwich sizes. I'm glad I went back and gave it another try!"}
{"text":"I was quite surprised when I was tracked down by management and was offered to come back and have my order corrected.

The connection to social media and customer service was outstanding.  (Which is a far cry from the CS the other\" veal place gives). I would give 5stars just to customer service.

So I came back and gave it another chance, same medium veal with mushrooms and provolone.  This was a completely different sandwich from my last one. If every sandwich coming out of the kitchen had this as its standard, then I understand the accolades.  All my toppings present.  3 pieces of veal ( the last had 2), fresh, tender.  I do find the toppings top rate here (when properly present).  I still like the crispier more breaded Cali one, and their sweet sauce too.  But, I would come back again to San Fran, as a closer friendlier alternative with better toppings.  If I could mash the two together...that would be perfect."}
{"text":"I was expecting something comparable to California Sandwiches but it just didn't compare. I've tried this a couple of times now (eggplant and veal) and the quality of ingredients, the bun, and the way it comes together is just not the same.  Just feels drier and more doughy overall."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Had the breaded chicken sammy and just like I expected I got the wrong thing the first time around. I am happy to say my second visit was great and I will for sure be going back for another amazing giant chicken sandwich! yay! Writing this reveiw kind of makes me want one right now..."}
{"text":"It's overpriced for what it is. The veal sandwich was okay minus the fact the veal kept slipping out. Not sure if user error or slippery veal. Nonetheless frustrating. 

Go to subway nearby if you want to fill up quick and don't want your protein falling out."}
{"text":"Despite entering the place when it was empty we had to wait more than 25 mins for our two sandwiches. After 20 minutes we asked for updates or status and the answer was \"sorry what did you order again?\". I still cannot understand what happened, the place was not that packed...guess they simply forgot about us.

After that, more disappointments - I could only taste mustard in my sandwich, the excess of sauce killed the other flavors. Really had to make an effort to finish my meal which is something that never happens to me! 

Not gonna come back."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are huge.  

I found mine a bit on the salty side.  This detracted from the overall enjoyment of the sandwiches.  We tried one veal and one chicken.  Extra toppings included sweet peppers, mushrooms, onions, and grilled zucchini.  

I don't think they should sell pizza.  They looked kinda dry just sitting there.  

Make sandwiches, get the breading right, and stick with a tasty sauce."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious sandwiches here. You get a huge sandwich for a great deal. Easy to get to by queen streetcar it's worth a trip to west end for sure. Very relaxed atmosphere, great for quick bite or grab and go."}
{"text":"It was incredibly quiet in here on a workday around noon. One man came in and asked about all their pizzas and sandwiches. I didn't hear all of the conversation, but I assume he got the relevant information he needed and then departed without ordering anything. 

I ordered the eggplant sandwich. Breaded and fried to perfection, topped with tomato sauce and extremely stretchy cheese. The thing was as big as my head. Couldn't even finish it. Two people could easily split a sandwich and be completely satisfied. Pizzas looked tasty too, and I'll likely be heading back to try a slice."}
{"text":"Came here and tried out their veal sandwich because there was a perk on ritual. There was only one customer when I walked into the restaurant and I immediately have a bad feeling about their food. The music in the restaurant was loud. I'm not sure how the staff will know if anyone walked in. Anyhow, my food was ready when I got there. I was surprised by the portion. The sandwich is literally bigger then my face. They were very generous on the veal, there were at least 3 to 4 peices of veal in my sandwich. The veal was actually served with tomato sauce, which I did not expect. The taste of the sandwich was ok. Nothing extraordinary. The veal and the bun got tougher every time I take a bite. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place, unless you have never had Italian sandwich before and you wanted to give it a try."}
{"text":"As huge fan of California sandwiches and the original San Francesco, I can honestly say, this location has the best veal sandwiches in Toronto by far. They say that it is the same recipe as the clinton location, but something is better. The expanded menu also looks great, gotta love the open kitchen and friendly staff too. Way to go. I'll be coming back for lunch. Welcome to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I'd heard about San Francisco Foods from my dad which is always a good sign for what I was going there for - a veal sandwich. I mean, if you have a veal sandwich on the menu, I'm probably going to order it as it's one of those items that can tell a lot about a restaurant. With the history of this place, I thought that it could - just maybe - be one of the best.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The sandwich itself was kind of soggy and the sauce seemed kind of sweet and perhaps overly seasoned with something. It didn't taste like an authentic Italian sauce which is the last issue I expected to have here. A friend of mine got the steak on a bun and it was so soggy they had to return it. The attendant was nice enough and made him something else but that one wasn't much better. Perhaps a new type of bun is in order?"}
{"text":"I would have given this place 3 stars if I wrote my review a year ago. But they've really shaped up. San Francesco in North York is a food institution as far as I'm concerned and this one fell short food wise and certainly in regards to its charm. But over the past few months they've just started to pump out better food more consistently. I would give the 4.5 stars if I could. The food is great. It just doesn't have the charm of the alness location. It also may be a bit more expensive. If you want a saucy veal sandwich, this place is top notch. Its the only thing I ever order so I can't comment on the rest of the menu. I get provolone and mushrooms, spicy. Mama Mia! **kiss my fingers"}
{"text":"Had the chicken sandwich. Wasn't impressed at all. Literally is a piece of chicken with sauce, no other topping. I'm comparing this to California sandwich which I had the veal. California was so much better for the same price."}
{"text":"I visited San Francisco's on a recommendation from a friend. I have to say I came away unimpressed. 

I ordered a veal parmesan on bun with mozzarella cheese. The marinara sauce was Bland and even worse, the bun was soggy / wet a minute after ordering. I finished the dry half of my sandwich and threw the other half away.

Now the price, $11.83 for a sub-par veal sandwich left me feeling robbed because I've eaten better parm sandwiches all over the GTA. Not to mention, charging extra for cheese is ridiculous. It's like going out for pizza and being charged extra because you want cheese on it.

According to the owner their prices are on par with their competition. 

NOTE TO OWNER:

Don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining! I've eaten much better sandwiches including cheese (can you believe it?) For 8$ tax included. I understand it's downtown but if you're going to charge a premium make sure it's actually a premium sandwich. 

Ex: Starbucks vs Tim Hortons.

Funny, the owner of this restaurant DOES NOT believe CHEESE is a STANDARD topping on a VEAL PARMESAN SANDWICH. Good one ..."}
{"text":"Massive expensive sandwich that taste terrible. Tasteless, sloppy, soggy. Lots of options on queen street west, this is not a good one. You deserve better."}
{"text":"Disturbingly good and filling veal sandwich. Get the extra sauce if you plan to eat in. Don't get the extra sauce if you do take out. By the time you get your sandwich home it will be a kind of tomato bread pudding."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect. They're a franchise and they just opened. It could go either way, right?

I ordered a crispy (aka deep fried) chicken sandwich with mozzarella cheese and mushrooms (all toppings are extra). 
Brought it home. It sat waiting for a good 45 min (I got busy!).
Even after sitting for all that time, it was gooooood. The 'shrooms didn't have that gross from-a-can metallic taste and the sauce wasn't on so thick it melted the bun. 
The chicken cutlet was massive, and the thickness was perfect.
Definitely a new gem in the 'hood for lunch!
So happy it's now open, and it's worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I've never walked by this place and thought \"I should eat here\" but for some reason I thought just that on Sunday when I needed a quick bite before heading back to Buffalo. This place is located right in the best part of Queen Street West and mainly consists of sandwiches, side dishes, and even some great looking gelato (Sadly, I did not try any). The gentleman working was quick to make the food we ordered and everything came out great. I ended up ordering a meatball sandwich which turned out much bigger then I thought it was going to be and we ordered some delicious french fries on the side. Overall, this was perfect for what we wanted, it was super fast and super tasty. I would definitely come back here for another meatball sandwich anyday!"}
{"text":"Meh.  The slices aren't that good - the first bite and I immediately regretted not taking a longer walk to North of Brooklyn."}
{"text":"They do pretty decent sandwiches, which are nice in the cold weather.  This is way better than subway etc.  The ingredients look real, and fairly unprocessed; something lacking at a lot of sub/sandwich joints downtown.


Cash or debt only, no credit card."}
{"text":"I came here namely because I am a stickler for Italian Sandwiches. Disclosure- I am vegetarian so I will not comment on the quality of the meat sandwiches. 

I ordered the eggplant sandwich and veggie sandwich,  both baby sized. Surprisingly, the baby sized sandwich was quite big. Not big enough for dinner, but a decent sized snack. I was quite stuffed after eating both of them. 

The eggplant sandwich was the better of the two. Large, crispy piece of eggplant on a bun, with the perfect amount of tomato sauce and cheese. The veggie sandwich on the other hand was soggy, and did not have much of a taste. 

I had asked the individual who was making my sandwich if he could make it spicy. He said yes but he did not actually do anything extra to the sandwich. I guess you have to ask them to add jalapeños? 

The place looked clean and had basic decor. There was a good amount of seating, and a fast-food type ambiance. I would not recommend this for a date or anything other than take out or a quick bite in. 

I might come back for the eggplant sandwich."}
{"text":"Food: 
The sandwiches start at 7.50 on top of which you can add toppings, fresh mozzarella $2, tomatoes $0.50, mushrooms $1.  I was a bit surprised by such expensive topics, but once the sandwich came i understood why.  They put a lot of the toppings on the sandwich.

I got the veal sandwiches the mentioned topics above.  It cost $12.40 with tax.  The sandwich had 4 pieces of veal and plenty of mozzarella, tomatoes and mushrooms.  It fully filled me and was definitely noticed the freshness of the ingredients.  


Locale: 
The place has a counter where you order and pick up the food. It has a handful of 2 person tables, and 2 tables for 4 people.  It is not great for dinning in, but good for take-out.  

I would recommend this place if you want a large and tasty meal for lunch to bring back to the office."}
{"text":"This place was below average.  The service was painfully slow and not overly friendly and it was not clear why.  There was no line and there were two people working.  The veal sandwich was enormous with lots of meat, but it was definitely not the best that I've ever had.  The other sandwich, which had Italian sausage was disappointing--it tasted much more like a mild kielbasa than Italian sausage.  The \"cesar salad\" was lame--it was a garden salad with caesar  dressing.  There were also massive pieces of vegetables that hadn't been cut properly and it include the bottom core of the lettuce that no one eats."}
{"text":"The first time I sunk my teeth in their veal sandwich I was in heaven. The thinly deep fried breaded slices of veal melted in my mouth. I immediately texted my friends and informed them that I have tasted the greatest veal sandwich in the city. I said this place is better than California Sandwiches!

But that was then and this is now.  With every subsequent visit, the sandwiches have gotten less and less tasty. The last time I went I was actually disgusted. My veal was greasy and messy. My bun was a soggy mess. It pretty much disintegrated into mush. I really don't know how to rate this place...on the memory of my first time or the disappointment of my last meal."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm in the area I stop by the Clinton location because it is delicious. Today I was on queen and decided to try out that location. I had a chicken sandwich and it was ok. A bit tasteless to be honest. I also had the cacciatore which seemed a little off in color (kind of brown over red) but it tasted normal. I asked for hot but was definitely given mild even after saying are you sure this is hot? I think the worst part of my experience was how dirty the tables were. They were discusting. Crumbs everywhere and grease all over. You could tell noone has wiped any of them down all day (it was 2pm). Overall I was pretty disappointed and won't be back to this location especially with all the options on queen. Sometimes when businesses franchise the quality goes down. I didn't find this the case with California sandwiches but I do feel this way with San Fran which is so disappointing because I always thought they made the most delicious sandwiches... I'm sorry for the bad review but I was very let down :("}
{"text":"Had a veal sandwich which was HUGE and GREASY. Very tasty. Kind of think it's a bit cheeky to pay extra for some of the toppings and sauces. Came to about $9 after adding grilled onions. Could have fed two ladies or left one guy very stuffed.

Food was good but the place was untidy. We went to sit down at the front and all 6-7 tables had cruddy food bits and mess leftover that hadn't been wiped down. Take out is likely the better option."}
{"text":"AOK. Me and my buddy were the only ones there for the entirety of our stay but dangggg the food took a long time to make. I think they had some takeout orders to take care of or something but it still leaves a bad impression when you're sitting there for 20+ minutes after paying and making your order twiddling your thumbs waiting for food with nobody else in sight. The food itself was exactly as I expected. Big and extra greasy. It sure hit the spot."}
{"text":"Inconsistency is an issue here........on my last two visits they cut back on the portion of veal in their sandwich and the sauce was cold. I do like their sandwich but it is hit or miss. Don't think I will be going back as Cali Sandwich is always reliable and they don't cheap out with their portions. Also, not sure how it works at other places, but here they fry everything (chicken, veal, meatballs) in the same oil which is kinda gross."}
{"text":"I am so happy I decided to walk in here when I was feeling hungry. This was not what I was expecting at all. The menu has a few sandwiches to choose from, all the important options. I went with eggplant. Basically its an eggplant park sandwich. The sandwiches come with sauce and cheese. You have the option to add more toppings to it as well. The food took maybe 10 minutes and it was ready. So fast! They also have little Italian sides as well, such as soppressata and cheese. Despite that, we order french fries. All the food was actually incredible. The sandwich was huge and tasted so good. The fries were also delicious. I will absolutely be stopping back here next time I'm very hungry on Queen Street."}
{"text":"San Francesco's sammies might be the star of the show, but you shouldn't overlook their poutine. One of the best poutine I've had in a while, and I'm in their delivery zone. Daaaaangerous. 

My husband loved his veal sandwich, and my chicken sandler was great, too. But I cannot emphasize this enough: Get their poutine. You deserve it."}
{"text":"came here in the summer time to enjoy some food, and was pleasantly surprised with how everything was. great location, great flavors, and great service. my only issue as funny as this sounds was with the bread, when I had the sandwiches the beard seemed to have dry my mouth up completely, but having said this the beard was very fresh. 
this location has ample seating, but is pretty packed during lunch and dinner time, parking is on the street if you can find it, with some lots being within walking distance, and lastly this is serviced by the 501 queen, and 510 spadina streetcars. 

if I am in the area this would be in my top five places to eat at, but sadly is not my favorite sandwich place in Toronto."}
