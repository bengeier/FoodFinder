{"text":"The food is an excellent. The price is reasonable. Excellent staffs. All the Vietnamese restaurants, this by far my favourite of all."}
{"text":"Pros:
-Nice & clean decor compared to many other pho places
-Portion size is above average, good value for money
-Good meat to noodle ratio
-Choice of fresh or dry noodles if you ask

Cons:
-Mediocre broth: they skimped on the pho spices while trying to over compensate by using MSG & salt
-Sub standard meat quality, it was clearly frozen and therefore drier and tougher than fresh meat

I had high hopes going to this place after reading reviews, but honestly it's below average. If it weren't for the decor & portion size, I would've given it 1 star."}
{"text":"I have been to this place couple of times since the new owners took over. The customer service was absolutely wonderful. All the staff working were courteous and checked in to see how we were doing. The food was spot on as well - we had satay chicken pho and BBQ chicken with rice. Also, the iced coffee is a must! Definitely will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this spot since i moved to Brampton 9 years ago.  It has been taken over by new management and it's definitely not the same.

I went in for a pho soup today and it was very bland and kind of unappetizing.  Last month I ordered the typical pad thai and again, big disappointment.  

After today, that will be the last time I eat there.  Need to find a new go to spot."}
{"text":"For being around the most chinese based areas in Toronto/Markham region, you can't expect much from this place. It's located in Metro Square and one of many chinese run pho places in the north side of Toronto.

It is however the only place in the north area that sells Bun Rieu oddly enough. I can barely find that in the west end where it is predominantly viets. 

The staff wear shirts that say \"Pho King\" on it but with a burger king logo. 

Parking at the plaza is not enjoyable at all. It's small, crammed and filled with bad chinese drivers... i can say this because i'm asian myself haha!

Food is tasty, hot and price is fair. Service is quick and so is the wait time for your food. You do get a bit thirsty though but that is nothing bubble tea can't fix next door. 

Either way i would still come back if i don't have high expectations. It is not bad nor is it spectacular."}
{"text":"I was surprised and impressed at how nice their decor was. Nothing overly fancy but very clean, pleasant, and respectable, even the bathrooms. You can tell they invested the money to create a nice atmosphere to dine in.

Their prices and portions are what you would expect from a Vietnamese Pho restaurant. I ordered the beef brisket stew in tomato sauce and while I generally find beef on the tough/chewy side at Pho restaurants, theirs was quite tender which is a reflection on the quality and preparation of their food. I tried the Pho broth as well and it was good.

Overall I had a great dining experience. Unfortunately (for them) not a lot of people were there on a Saturday night but it did make it nice and quiet. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a co-worker as I've never been, and he recommended it.

Must say, service is fast. We both had Pho Noodle dishes and it came within minutes of ordering. 

Service was fast, no need to repeat any request. Enjoyed the soup base and would visit again.

It was cash only since they said their machine was down.Sign was on the counter facing the tables, but should have been on the door, visible when you walk in or at least mentioned by server."}
{"text":"Try this place it's under new management  food is awesome here and service is prompt after I order my food was ready in 5 mins"}
{"text":"This resraurant bought out Bamboo Garden. I have been coming here for years and since the change, prices increased. Tonight  ordered takeout and found out that we can no longer order  a small soup on the takeout menu....medium and up only??? My son is young and even a small is too big. I ciuld have ordered a large and split ut and save money....it makes no sense."}
{"text":"Food was ok - not very flavorful.  Wasn't bad, but wasn't particularly good either, compared to other local places we have been to.  Had Tom Yum and the Beef pho.  Portions were good sizes, price reasonable, service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Placed my order and I waited 30 minutes for it (takeout) people came in 15 min into me waiting (to dine in) and got food before me. So stupid and he did not even apologize or explain why it took so long. Never again"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I always pop in at least once a week. The staff is friendly, and always remembers who you are! 

The food is top notch! Lots of veg friendly options and they are always willing to substitute. I would highly recommend the fresh tofu rolls, singaporean noodles and red curry!

The ambiance of the place is very relaxed. Feels like you're going to visit family.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So been here 2 times already.. sorry didn't get to take any picture hubby and the kids dogged into the food right away.. so let me start by saying this is a new brand of PHO tere have been many Pho in this spot from bamboo garden to pho Kennedy and I will be honest it doesn't get really busy I guess just because of the location it is in.. But as a customer and previous customer of the past pho that was in this location I have to say the new owners that took over are doing an awesome job and they are spot on in their dishes..

There are a few things that I want to mention just like almost every pho place they also have a television that does have the news on so I personally like watching what's going on so to me that's a plus.. and the thing for me that makes this place different is they play 70's and 80's music which me and the hubby are a big fan of usually you hear their own culture music which is also great to hear the instruments but as an 70 and 80 fan it was something that made us even say we would come back here just for the music..

Staff is very friendly I have a 5 year old boy and 9months baby girl and they interact with them they say hi and even play with our kids and right away they gave our son a glass of water instead of tea cause not all kids like tea..they had no issue when my son went closer to see them making his bubble tea.

Food wise they are spot on in flavor o don't have to add anything to the broth of the pho unless I want it spicy then add hot sauce.. we have tried pad Thai stir..fried rice noodle..glass noodle pho..regular pho..fresh rolls..vermicelli and another soup noodle dish which was spicy and all of it was delicious I have no complaints on how they made the food and the amount is great they are not stingy and the pricing is very reasonable.. 

**I hope the new owners will have more business they did mention they knew the location is a tough spot for business but they have hope and o hope with this review it can help them have more business since for me they did an amazing job and have great customer service.."}
{"text":"Been on a real Vietnamese kick recently trying a few around my area and I picked this one because of the name.

Just like people say, the bowls are nice and big and the food was nice and tasty. The meat to noodle ratio could be better but I left satisfied.

The staff are fast and friendly and parking is ok but far from perfect."}
{"text":"Use to order from this place 5-6 times a week via skip the dishes.
Sent us RAW CHICKEN before... Disgusting and reported to skip the dishes.
Today they left out the grilled sausages from our order then LIED to skip the dishes... and said they had sent everything ordered.
We decided to give them a second chance as my bf likes their Pho, even though they are problematic... I went to reheat one of the meals and found METAL PIECES Sticking out of the chicken.
Just not meant to be. Place is a danger on many levels... so weird to have so many issues with one restaurant. It is just scary now and not worth the consistent issues."}
{"text":"I got the house special pho in small size n it's really really small. My friend got the tomato beef brisket noodle, both were very salty.  The service is ok, just the food isn't very good. I asked the server to change the soup because it's really too salty and they took it back in to add hot water to dilute the broth."}
{"text":"Passable pho. Very tasty soup with a load of MSG (bring on the water) and a soft yet springy texture in the noodles which is pleasant. The noodles here are a more traditional pho compared to the usual thinner ones found in Toronto. Price is fare at $7.75 for a medium shchi was comparable to the large at Pho 88.  My wife had a large Satay beef Pho which was also tasty and just slightly spicy. 
Will only come back here if passing by, if not, Pho 88 is just down the road."}
{"text":"A craving for some Vietnamese food brought me here with a coworker. We ordered the spring rolls, curry lamb with rice noodle soup, and a rice dish that came with grilled chicken and pork, shredded pork, steamed egg, a fried egg, and veggies. It's the perfect dish if you can't decide what to order.

The spring rolls, the item by which I compare Vietnamese restaurants, were okay, good but not great. The flavour was good but they were kinda on the skinny side.

The soup broth was intense, with lots of curry and lamb flavour but very balanced with the noodles. It would have been great with a bowl of rice.

All the components of the rice dish tasted good but they were all a little bit on the dry side, especially the rice. The pork and chicken were either just slightly overcooked or had been sitting for a few minutes before being served.

Although it wasn't a perfect evening, it wasn't bad. There were enough choices on the menu that would bring me back to try them."}
{"text":"Deep Fried Spring Roll was pretty ok, I quite like it.

However, the portion of their Pho is quite small, and the taste is just ok.  Pretty like their bean sprouts, as you can get cooked bean sprouts if you really don't like raw bean sprouts.

I was very disappointed with their Satay Chicken Skewers... Sauce has no satay taste... taste like hot sauce with some peanuts..."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Pho restaurant I've been to. The inside is somewhat decent... servers are rude, food is not even close to being okay to being served. My pho, the tripe had a disturbing textured to it... they didn't use the traditional proteins and the noodles were over cooked to the point it had a mashed potato textured to it."}
{"text":"Decided to grab some pho since we were in the area, and hadn't had viet food in a while so we thought why not. The place was clean, and the service was prompt which is always a plus (although we were the only ones there, so...).
Anyway, the food was fine but the low rating is due to what another reviewer echoed, at that was there was HAIR in both of our meals. The bf found eyelashes - not just 1 eyelash, but eyelashes plural - in his pho, and I had the lovely honor of finding a greying hair in my vermicelli, follicle still attached YUM. 
So eat here at your own risk if you have no other choices. I will not be back, not until their kitchen staff get with the times and wear hairnets or something."}
{"text":"I've been here with the hubby twice now and we were please every time. Price and portion are good. And everything we had so far taste great. I like the service here, they are very friendly and nice. The place is not too busy and the owner said they are still new in the neighborhood. I hope more people come and try it out because it is actually worth it!"}
{"text":"Food was disappointing, portion was small and the staff was very very rude. No eye contact (she was rolling her eyes when we asked for spoons), lazy and almost splashed hot broth on our table. Won't be returning and we don't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The king! This place is so close to my house I could crawl there in 5 minutes. OK maybe not that long, but close enough. 

The staff is very friendly and is a family owned restaurant from what it seems. They are fluent in English, Cantonese and mandarin so everyone is welcomed! 

The pho here is amazing! It's a good price, good size and delicious! They also have many other viet dishes,  but I haven't tried yet. Safe to say it's probably quite bomb! 

Last note the milkshakes hmmmm. They are so good! Definitely must try avocado milkshake! 

The parking lot can get a bit packed since it shares with the plaza. So be careful depending when you go!"}
{"text":"Best pho place I've ever been too! Soup is delicious and portions are fair. Spring rolls and wings were one of the best I've ever eaten. I will be sure to come back!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Pho restaurants in GTA. The service and the food quality is very good. We were very happy and the food quality was really good."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The food quality has improved after the new management took over. The staff was very friendly and the service was amazing."}
{"text":"Pho King has shrunk their bowl sizes from times past but they are still very large. Good Pho and spring rolls. Place is nice and clean."}
{"text":"My go-to pho restaurant in Brampton! 

My boyfriend and I always go here - especially over the summer LOL. Bored? Lets go eat at Pho Kennedy. Hungry but don't know where to eat? Lets go to Pho Kennedy. Need some food after a good work out? PHO KENNEDY! 

We go here so often even my boyfriend's best friend know to meet up here every time we invite him out to eat with us! Literally don't even have to tell him we're going to Pho Kennedy :P 

The workers there are very nice and interactive too so that's another plus! There was a guy that worked there over the summer that'd recognize my boyfriend and I every time we came - didn't get his name but he made a really good impression of Pho Kennedy on my first visit. Super nice and approachable! 

Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. When I first began to dine here, I always thought the food was great. However, the recent TWO times (in a time span of 6 months), there was a nasty piece of hair with GUNK on it. BOTH times. Disgusting! I made sure it was a piece of hair by examining it. No matter how good the food is, you cannot overcome that fact, especially if it has happened more than once. Told the owner the first time, they did not even care."}
{"text":"Pho King Vietnamese Cuisine has a really strange menu... aside from the usual Vietnamese Pho, Bun or whatever... it is the first Vietnamese restaurants I been to offering Mala (numbing spicy) lamb noodle soup?! And there are quite a few lamb dishes on the menu too...

But coming here as a first timer, it is hard for me not to stay with my usual choice at a Pho joint? I will leave those lamb dishes for the more adventurous type!

Special House Pho Small ($5.75)
- The broth was nicely seasoned and with a hint of herbs and anise
- Beef/Meat was plentiful, the tendon was especially tender
- Noodle was the fresh type
- Size wise the portion is more like a medium in a lot of places!! 

This used to be Pho All http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pho-all-vietnamese-cuisine-markham and now is Pho King.... 

I sometimes get really confused myself where I am \"pho\"ing!"}
{"text":"The food here Is not so good. The soup base we tried we pretty disgusting. Rare beef noodle soup and hue style noodle soup. Took couple bites and we left . Went to eat something else."}
