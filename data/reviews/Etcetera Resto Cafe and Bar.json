{"text":"We ordered avc chicken burger and poutines for the first time on sunday evening. It was excellent delivery service. Our food arrived much earlier than i expected and the delivery lady was so patient and friendly. Our food were still hot and tasty. awesome customer service."}
{"text":"We were walking in the Spadina & Queen area looking for a patio that wasn't busy and we found Etcetera. I was tempted to just keep walking but we were just going for a drink before our film on John Street so we decided to stop in. 

We ended up with a great seat. Our waitress was super nice and not pushy at all. She made a wine suggestion that was delicious. After looking at the menu, we decided to order. My salmon salad was delicious and wasn't salty like most salmon salads tend to be. The Skinny steak was also amazing (so I was told) I did try a French Fry and it was really good. 

When the bill came, I was shocked at how inexpensive it was. The service, price, location and quality of food is the reason why I gave them 5 shiny stars.

**If you are in the Queen & Spadina area, try this place out for drinks or food or drinks and food**

They don't have a website but I found their Twitter: @EtcRestoCafeBar  - they Tweet their specials."}
{"text":"Poor excuse for a restaurant. Just ordered take out for 5 colleagues and myself. Their only menu online doesn't exist anymore and they don't sell half the items on it. My $12 poached salmon salad is the size of a side salad, with crumpled shitty salmon on top. They didn't have take out cups for my smoothie. So once charged, to get a refund, don't ask! My boss' chicken burger literally was a chicken wing, with bone, stuffed in a bun. Gross. Will never return"}
{"text":"Staff friendly and the food is awesome. Great food selection and very clean environment. Def recommend."}
{"text":"I have eaten brunch here a couple of times. The first time I had a grilled cheese which was made with avocado, goats cheese and pesto...it was divine and inspired me to have brunch here again and this time I had good old steak and eggs! 

Other Yelpers have commented on the friendly staff and they are not wrong! Staff are lovely and attentive.  Service is speedy and spot on.

Food is delicious and as a brunch spot it is generally quite busy. They have specials menu if I recall correctly. 

The restaurant has a small patio out front which is perfect for people watching on Spadina...something which I love to do. 

Cost wise this place is very reasonable and is brilliant for a relaxing brunch with endless cups of tea!"}
{"text":"Nice looking place, with outdoor seating. Came here at around 10:30 Friday night, it was actually pretty empty.... also really really bright. 

We sat at the bar, talked to some other bar fellows who bought us drinks. Bartenders were nice :)"}
