{"text":"i had heard about fresh soba for probably years and finally tried it a few weeks ago.  On Tuesdays, we made a reservation earlier in the day, it wasn't busy at all when the 4 of us arrived. I loved the texture of the fresh soba, preferring the one that isn't already in sauce (the sauce makes it a bit mushy over time). The dishes aren't cheap, and they only take cash, but I enjoyed my experience and would go back. It's worth supporting people who are passionate and care to make quality food like this!"}
{"text":"I think this may be the only place in town that does fresh, handmade soba.

They grind the buckwheat on the day of and they're only there on Tuesdays at Ichikiri on Bloor from 5:00 to 8:30. They used to do it every Sunday at Hiro Sushi but that changed a long while back.

There are several styles of soba including one with freshly made tofu or snow crab. The soba itself is typically done with a ratio of 80/20 buckwheat to wheat but they will do 100% buckwheat (which actually takes a lot of skill to do due to not having any wheat to help it stay together) if you ask. Commercial soba bought on store shelves only requires a minimum buckwheat proportion of 30% to be legally called soba and often are at ratios of 30/70. The difference between the two is worlds apart and far tastier in this rendition.

The price ranges from about 13-21 dollars and includes a small app, the bowl of soba itself, followed by a drink of sobayu (the water it was boiled in) mixed with tsuyu (the dipping sauce that was in the bowl of soba) and a dessert."}
{"text":"Incredible soba, made with care and authentic ingredients. The only downside is that since everything is made right on the spot, the service may take some time. Do my recommend coming with a group larger than 4 as will be eating at different times. Otherwise, a must eat!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food at Soba Canada as it fit a lot of the criteria I look for when I'm going to a \"specialty\" restaurant: menu items not easily found elsewhere, authentic, fresh ingredients, homemade everything....but the one criteria it was missing for me, was value - or should I say, volume.  At an average of $20 for a soba dish, it's just a little bit steep to eat more than once in my life.  It's not that I wouldn't pay $20 for food, it's just that I had to go eat a real dinner after that.  Word of advice, if you're hungry, do not get the oboro soba (house-made tofu on soba) just for yourself without planning to share someone else's meal. It's literally a glob of tofu on top of plain noodles.  The seafood soba came with veggie and seafood tempura though which was very well done and just filling enough for a light-medium eater.

A note on the ambiance at the restaurant; there is none.  There is no background music and it wasn't very crowded when I went, so it was dead silent and super awkward because if you spoke at barely above a whisper, the whole restaurant could hear you.  Also the furniture belongs in a library from the 90's, not a restaurant.

Overall, I think I liked Soba Canada because the food was \"authentic\" and fresh.  But at the same time, you have to like buckwheat noodles to begin with, and cold noodles just don't provide that satisfaction of a filling meal, especially not for dinner."}
{"text":"I went to Ichiriki Restaurant to try the soba menu and ordered the Ten Zaru Soba which is a cold soba for dipping in a sauce and comes with tempura on the side. It was SO good! The noodles have a great texture and are all uniformly thin. The sauce was a bonito/soy type sauce and came with green onions and freshly grated real wasabi on the side. I added them together and with the soba, it tasted really good. The tempura included two shrimps and a variety of vegetables. The batter had a lot of finesse and was incredibly light, it also came with a lime wedge and some togarishi salt on the side. Really delicious. 

My friend ordered the chirashi soba which is also cold but comes with the sauce already. It also had nice pieces of real crab, ikura and tamago that was cut the same size as the soba. The flavours were excellent as well from the bite I tried. 

We also ordered the oboro tofu to share on the side. Silky smooth, lovely clean taste. I really enjoyed this as well although for people who don't like tofu in general, I don't think they would appreciate this since this dish allows the flavour of the tofu to shine and it's not covered with a lot of additional flavour even though it has a sauce like the soba sauce as well. 

Service was nice, atmosphere was quiet and cozy. One thing to note is that this place is CASH ONLY. 

Btw, if people are looking at the photo of the menu that is posted here, please note that that menu is super old and it will differ when you go to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Traditional and Authenticity brought me to Soba Canada's website a few years ago.  The curiosity began as typically watching a television show of a Soba Chef cutting FINE lengths of fresh Soba with a Soba Kiri. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soba_kiri)

Having missed my opportunity in Tokyo to experience a Soba experience, I now look to Soba Canada which is held at Ichiriki on Tuesday nights.  We were sat in a quiet room with a couple other tables of patrons while we were given Tea and some Chips & Crispy Noodles, which we later found to be various Soba-made deep-fried appetizers accompanied by a Miso dip possibly with Plum.   3.5 *Star*

It was an easy decision to make when the Menu had some items that noted \"Chef's Recommendations\" which was the Okonomi Soba($20.00) that provides a Oboro Tofu Soba wile including your choice of 2 flavours out of the 4 given(Tororo, Oroshi, Snow Crab, Ikura Roe)

OBORO TOFU - Favourite that comes standard in the Okonomi Soba order.  Soft Silky Tofu mounted the Soba and Tsuyu underneath.  

It's my favourite because the Tofu didn't obstruct the Soba/Tsuyu therefore you can taste the Soba in it's natural form.  Soba has miniscule grooves that help carry the Tsuyu but at the same time it was smooth with excellent SLURP slipperiness.

TORORO - Puree of Yamaimo (Japanese Yam).  Think Natto or snot consistency which adds an extra level of slippery slurpness to the Soba however the texture and feel might not be for the uninitiated.

ORISHI - Grated Daikon Radish.  This provides a slight freshness to the Tsuyu while also slightly hot since it was raw Radish.

IKURA ROE - This one had some Oroshi as the anchor.  Along with some Wasabi this one reminds me of Goshiki Natto at Izakayas.  Btw, I love Wasaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabi.

SNOW CRAB - It had to be my least favourite personally.  Probably because it didn't unite with the Noodles as well as other offerings while Oboro was just good.

After the Soba Mains we were given Soba-yu(Warm water that boiled Soba).  Think of it like the Spaghetti water but less thick in density.  I consumed it as a Tea of sorts.  I served my Masters well as the assigned Geisha serving the SOBA-YU.

DESSERT - Buckwheat Porridge with Azuki Beans.  It was a nice end to the meal and it wasn't overly sweet.  A regular dessert however this one was made with Buckwheat.

I give an extra 0.5 *Star* for Authenticity and the honor to get this chance to try Traditional Soba in the city of Toronto.  Arigato Gozaimasu!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! They only serve cold soba in the summer though, and sometimes only certain ones so be sure to ask beforehand. Zaru soba is imo the best one, and then ten zaru which is basically the same thing but with tempura on the side ha! It does take a while to make though, so maybe arrive a little earlier than your usual dining time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was invited by two lovely Yelpers to join them for some soba on a rainy Tuesday night. One of my companions took heaps of photos so stay tuned!

The owner, a former 'salaryman' who immigrated to Canada, does not have a shop of his own. Rather, he rents out the spaces of other establishments to sell his product. I remember when you could order his soba from Nakamura Bakery at J-Town. He now sets up shop at Ichiriki on Tuesday evenings.

I ordered the Chef's Omakase (leaving it up to chef), which was $20 even. You get three bowls of soba (buckwheat noodles) with various topping. 

Bowl 1 - Tororo (Japanese yam)
Bowl 2 - Snow crab w wasabi and green onion 
Bowl 3 - Tofu w green onion

Was not a fan of 1, but 2 and 3 were good.

The menu is not extensive and there is nothing warm on the menu... I would have been happy if there was warm tempura soba on the menu. Overall not too shabby of a place. I think I enjoyed the company more than anything. ;]"}
{"text":"Authentic, fresh-made japanese soba. The food is delicious. It's great that someone in Toronto is offering this special Soba experience. Try it!"}
{"text":"The people at Soba Canada don't f*ck around.  They are serious -- serious about soba!  Despite its simplicity, the soba has immense integrity and I enjoyed my meal as much as I would've had I had an incredibly complex dish (with foam, gastrique, sou vied, and whatever have you).  I went with the zaru soba and oboro (house made tofu).  I don't really know how to express how amazing the soba is because it'll just sound like \"chewy noodles, fresh, umame, handmade, refreshing blah blah blah\".  So if anyone need convincing, they should watch that episode of No Reservations where Anthony Bourdain visits the Soba master.  I know it's not the exact same thing, but will get you in the mood for sure.  Apart from the fact that soba is tasty, it's also healthy, low-fat, organic, and vegan -- terms that I would normally hit with my car, get out, spit on them, get back into the car, back into it, before finally driving off. I really hope that more people support Soba Canada so that there will more simple yet authentic restaurants like this in Toronto."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience of Fresh made Soba at Soba Canada.. Just the idea of having someone willing to offer this unique and authentic experience in Toronto! That alone worth an extra 1 star! 

Buckwheat flour suppose to be nutritious and rich in vitamins and dietary fibre. This do give me an excuse to indulge on my soba experience! Hey eating buckwheat suppose to lowers blood pressure, controls blood sugar and increase liver function (that's what I need being hyper, eating too much sugary marcarons and drinking too much alcoholic beverages!) 

Just love how everything that was served here are related to buckwheat.. from appetizer, main and dessert! 

I am lucky enough to able to tried all the different soba by sharing an Okonomi Soba with my dining mate... now I know which one I will pick if I am lucky to come here again! 

Oboro Tofu - love how soft and silky the tofu blended well with the soba taste... give me a light and refreshing taste and feel of well being and healthy... 

Tororo - I usually love yam... but not this form of puree Japanese yam.. I find that it makes the soba really gluey tasting and really blend and heavy 

Orishi - So so.. but if you are for the pure taste of raw radish, this one is for you 

Ikura Roe - I always have a weakness for Salmon roe and the freshly grated wasabi... that's the one I going to order for sure next time 

Snow Crab - enjoyed the crab meat..just because they are good tasting and I love crab... nicely presented.... 

Next up is the Sobayu, why are we served the water that the fresh soba was cooked in? As most of the water soluble nutrients and vitamins were lost in the hot water that soba was cooked in, so by drinking that boiled water, you will recap all the good things that soba provided. You suppose to mix the water with the soba dipping sauce. Taste wise is it nothing exciting but just the idea behind this is so interesting! 

So the verdict of fresh vs packaged soba, which one I prefer? The texture between them are different as the fresh one are more chewy and has a stronger buckwheat taste! Of course, if I have a choice.. the fresh one wins hands down!"}
