{"text":"Johnny's Drive In is an absolute favorite of mine, ever since I was a kid. It's old school to the core and the food is top notch. I absolutely love the Ham BBQ with a chocolate milkshake. To me, it doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. If your into eating a good ole burger with traditional condiments and want it cheap. GO HERE! Boyfriend begs me to go here its soo good. Cool curb service too kinda like sonic but not as fancy. GET the monster burger! They have deals on them  everyday I think from 11-2. I suggest trying johnnys"}
