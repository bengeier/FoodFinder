{"text":"This cool new place has been putting itself together in NODA for quite some time now.....LOVE the location and they did a great job making the interior comfy and relaxing.  Its still in its soft opening phase and are awaiting their liquor license.  I had the chicken parm from the limited soft opening menu and it was very good.  I look forward to this place opening up fully and trying the rest of the menu.  Great addition to the neighborhood and I will be back for a visit soon."}
{"text":"Great disappointment, ordered the Chicken Teriyaki perhaps a better name would be Greek/Italian Chicken with a cup of Teriyaki sauce.  Cubed chicken with greek/Italian seasoning on a hoagie like roll with a cup of teriyaki sauce.  Excellent Tea! Waitress was awesome!  I love and cook great Italian food (no spice or true ingredient spared when cooking i.e. lasgana) this place lost its spices from Italy.  Another painful journey!"}
{"text":"This was a great spot in Noda for a good Italian home cooked meal. They were really fast too. Good service. Amazing food. We ordered the pasta bolognese and fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. Both were amazing!! Very fresh food and good amount too. I got the spinach salad which was perfect. Also we had a Caesar  salad too which was great. Overall, strongly recommend! A little bit pricey but would 100% go again."}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten here yet, for shame.  Single handedly the best place to eat in NoDa.  Ride the light rail in, hang a right on Donaldson and it'll be a couple blocks down on the left.  You can't miss it, IT'S A RED HOUSE.  :)  Seriously though, I've been going here with my wife and have tried just about everything and not once have I been disappointed.  Go.  Now.  What are you waiting for?  The staff is all fantastic,  the owners are the sweetest most amazing people.  Do yourself a favor and go."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time with my daughter and best friend. The food was amazing and the staff was excellent. I had the eggplant parmigiana with side salad, the balsamic vinaigrette was absolutely amazing - my daughter kept eating it out of the cup. My friend got the spaghetti with meat balls. The meatballs had an amazing flavor. They have indoor and outdoor seating which is super convenient with a toddler! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Tried this new place for the first time on Saturday to celebrate Festivus with friends.  What an awesome experience!!!  The chicken parm was huge and done perfectly.  They even accommodated one of my gluten-free friends by leaving off the breading on her chicken.  When it comes to service and hospitality, Levi our waiter, Randy the manager, and Jimmy the owner get it."}
{"text":"Fantastic outside eating space!  Lots of tables, shade by a giant tree, and fenced  off.  Menu had great choices. I had the chicken teriyaki sub, Sean had the meatball sub.  Both came with delicious fries.  The sandwiches were very tasty, and our server was really nice.  Perfect lunchtime break for me!"}
{"text":"Gives you the true home cooked Italian feel! The best chicken parm sandwich I've had in a while. highly recommend to go!!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to Noda! I had the sausage onion and pepper entree which was delicious. As sides I had mashed potatoes and succotash, which were also great. Big portions, great flavor, and quick service.  Friendly service and attentive wait staff. The homemade cheesecake is top of the line!! I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for high quality Italian home cooking."}
{"text":"Great food--the onion rings are amazing! I had the chicken parmesan, and I took half home for lunch the next day. Huge portion. Friendly service. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The hype for this place was huge, and for me so was the letdown.  It's just basic dinner food that you'll find anywhere else, likely for a better price."}
{"text":"Had the Opportunity to meet the Owner and his wife. Great people- wait staff was friendly too. Dinner and desserts were delicious."}
{"text":"We met the owners who are great. They are very open to whatever u want and they will accommodate you. Now onto the food. Let me start off by saying I am veryyyyyyyyy picky when it comes to Italian food cause I cook all kinds and I'm Italian. The red sauce was ok, needed more basil and garlic in my opinion but everyone has their own version. Our daughter who is 15 liked it. The fettuccine Alfredo sauce needed alot more flavor.  The meat sauce was very good. I had the chicken parm sandwich and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Great outside seating area and their mimosas pours are awesome."}
{"text":"First time on Yelp and did it to leave a review for this new spot in hope of its success. First time eating here, the staff accommodated our large group with kids, had the table all setup with a quick call ahead.  Staff was amazing, super friendly, and attentive. Food was delicious, from apps to deserts it was great!  I hope that this place continues to get busy, from my experience they deserve it!"}
{"text":"The staff were very pleasant, that was about the only positive of my to-go order.  I ordered a chicken parm hero which also comes with fries or o-rings...which made the $13 price a little more realistic.  The sandwich was probably the worst attempt at chicken parm I have ever had.  The bread was terrible, like mass-produced hamburger roll terrible.  The chicken was clearly a frozen patty diced up and swimming in canned sauce and covered with cheese that was melted, however not browned so that just screams \"I was microwaved\".  I had high hopes since the neighborhood desperately needs a good Italian spot, but was quite disappointed and won't be back.  If burger king still served their Italian Chicken Sandwich, it would be head and shoulders better than my experience at Red House."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when the wait for Cabo Fish Taco was too long and we are so glad we did!  Great Italian food and even better owners who were so personable and actually do all the cooking!!! The have the freshest ingredients and homemade desserts! Can't wait to go back to try their breakfast!! Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Very satisfied with the Red House! I've been a few different times since they are in walking distance from my job and house in Noda. This is a family owned restaurant and the owners are absolutely wonderful. The food is great (pasta, salads, and sandwiches) and the bakery sweets are heavenly. Staff is all very attentive and welcoming. Love that they remodeled one of the old original mill houses and kept its character. It's nice to walk in and feel like you're getting a home cooked family meal. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am literally crying tears right now about the money I wasted here the other night. I sat for awhile thinking about how to word this and if I even wanted to, since it was just my first visit.  The person on the phone was nice when I placed my to go order. The environment seemed nice and intimate.  The side salad was not the freshest. The Italian dressing was very basic. The baked ziti was not good. There was no baked, cheesy top like you would expect.  The sauce and cheese were mixed together like a vodka sauce, I prefer red.  The noodles were way over cooked.  I like al dente, and this was far from it.  I couldn't eat it.  I was pretty depressed over it.  The bread is good.   Ok so, I had high hopes for this place. The menu looks good and there is a variety of foods to choose from, perhaps I chose the wrong thing.  I would be willing to try this place again and see how the other dishes taste."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here and I can now say everything that I have ever ordered from here is delicious.  That includes sausage and peppers sandwich, minestrone soup, house potatoes, cheese sticks, meatloaf sandwich, ice cream, cookies, and French fries.   So far that is all I can personally endorse but when you are battling 1000 I would say you have a quality place.  Give me some time and I am sure I will be able to tell you everything on The menu is great!!!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and had walked past this place a few times. It's got a pretty nonchalant exterior (a Red House) but when you walk inside it's a super cute little place. There's a nice bar upfront, a selection a baked goods and the dining area set a bit off back.   We ordered some minestrone soup and the Italian sausage with peppers and onions. It's was delicious!!!! Our waitress was so adorable and so attentive.   It's a great spot that I would frequent. Oh, they also have a walk up window where you can order ice cream and other desserts. In the summer they'll have a great patio with all sorts of games (ie Corn hole, bocce ball, etc). Best of all the patio area/walk up windows is pet friendly!   The owners came out and chatted for a bit.  They insisted that we try the ice cream which was delicious! Especially, the banana pudding! They were super nice.  Overall a great experience! Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm a big supporter of new and old businesses in NODA since I live here and want to see them succeed. Win-Win all around with everything in walking distance.  Red House Cafe (RHC) is a cute red house that serves Italian style food with a few other options like sandwiches, burgers, salads and deserts. Finally got around to trying RHC during the first heavy snow fall of 2018. I have to admit I was expecting so much more with the food quality, presentation and taste from the dinner service. The service was ok since there was one person on tables but also working the wine bar which is expected it's freaking snowing outside.  We ordered the chicken teriyaki and the meat loaf. The presentation of the chicken teriyaki was a bit mushy like and wish the menu would have mentioned peppers, onions and potatoes. The asparagus was softer than my liking and wish it had been skinned as it's easier and more pleasing to eat. The succotash was great.  The meat loaf had good flavors but way to much breading added. I tasted more of the breading than actual beef. The mash potatoes were extremely buttery to where you could barely taste the potatoes. The green beans were very mushy and again buttery so didn't really enjoy it. We also felt for the price of the wine we would have received more and they should splurge on wine glasses with stems. This could have been what was available because of the weather but wanted to mention.  We believe this was a one-off because of the weather so we'll try dinner service again and heard great things about their breakfast so we'll be back. I definitely plan on updating my review based on next visit."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, at all ....I don't like to give one star, so I landed on two.  I'm disappointed in the overall experience at The Red House Cafe. I knew it was a humble exterior and hoped to be greeted with more than a few \"southern charm\" quotes about sweet tea on the walls inside, but that's the extent of the vibes. The menu was fairly large. Mostly southern spins on food and comfort tastings. There were vegetarian/veganish options so it worked.   The service had little knowledge about the menu and seemed to be spread thinly; oddly enough there were only three tables in at the time.   We ordered. We waited. Waited. Witnessed a Togo order wait an extended period of time and then decline his order once he received it because it didn't look very good. Waited more....Asked where our food was (we ordered a salad with no meat, an omelet and veggie burger with fries). We waited more. 1 hour after ordering our food arrived. Subpar display and a Taste that matched.   To the defense of the staff; they apologized and offered free cookies/bakery items, but it was too late. We literally didn't have any time to spare we had been there for two hours and were late for our next adventure.   Save yourself the time and maybe go in for a Pastry or wine.    This was my plate I ordered the veggie burger, no bun with sweet potato fries... looks a kids meal."}
{"text":"What a great place! The hand cut home made French fries were excellent. I had the Phili cheese steak and it was to big to pick up and not make a mess. It had real cheddar cheese and I think it also had potato chunks and was also great. My coworker had the chicken parm sandwich, took one bite and said, \"we are coming back tomorrow.\"   The staff was quick, friendly and really paid attention. Even the kitchen staff came out to make sure everything was good and even offered to refill our drinks.  Guess I know where we are having lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place to go for a nice, warm meal. The foods on the menu (a rather large menu) make you feel like you're at home, and so does the cozy atmosphere!   My boyfriend and I visited a while ago, and we both enjoyed what we ordered. The meatloaf was super, and so were those potatoes! When we visited, they had a limited menu and no wine/beer, but I can't wait to get back and try something from their full menu! Welcome to Noda, Red House!"}
{"text":"Food was good, waitress was very friendly. Hard to find a place to park which is typical of all NoDa businesses."}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind.  The only Italian food in NoDa, and it's worth it.  The interior is so homey and quaint, ambiance is nice, day or night.  I've eaten here on more than one occasion and was thoroughly impressed each time.  The fettuccine alfredo with chicken is my favorite, but the chicken parmesan is stellar!!!  They have tables outside around a 200 year old tree, music, and ice cream!!!  Come in and visit with the owners Jimi and Joanie and get a little taste of New Jersey.  Everyone there is very kind, and happy to serve you."}
{"text":"What saved this review from a 2 is the ambience from the lovely patio area which proved to be dog friendly.   Wait staff was pleasant and seated us quickly outside.   First dish was mozzarella appetizers, which were small and cost over $1 ea. They were fine.  The entrees came, and the side salad was a tiny bowl of romaine.  I ordered the alfredo with chicken which was low on sauce and flavor. I didn't even want my left overs. My friend got the hot dog with onion rings. Again disappointed. The hot dog came with soup chili on it soaking the entire bun creating a hot mess you had to eat with a fork and knife.  The onion rings we were so excited for, were over breaded and some still cold.  Overall not impressed and won't be back."}
{"text":"I am born and raised in NJ and was happy to get a taste of home.  Chicken parm sub was awesome and my daughter wolfed down the French toast.  Owners and staff are super nice and service was great.  Fantastic addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"There are many things that you may WANT in your life but you just can't achieve. I had a microcosm of this frustrating life challenge at Red House Cafe.   Here was my painful journey:  I wanted the wings to be good.  They were potentially from frozen.   I wanted the sandwich (Cheesesteak) to be good.  It wasn't.    My friends wanted their food to be anything of value (Chicken Parm sub and also a Cheesesteak)  We cried in tandem as we paid $100 for 3 people.   I wanted the desserts to be awesome.  They were subpar except 1 which was decent.   I wanted there to not be a room outside that we kept seeing the employees go in and out from and when asked were told it's where the employees rip cigs because they are slow.  It exists.   Red House Cafe may be appropriately named because I don't see them being in the black on the balance sheet any time soon unless they make drastic changes.  BOLO for a \"Coming soon...sign for this location. Better odds on that than betting on Red House Ca  Glimmers of hope:  Outdoor patio is a great venue.  Their breakfast (Blueberry Pancakes)   Yet to try the ice cream..."}
{"text":"This is a very warm and inviting place with delicious food! My favorites were the caesar salad, the meatball parmesan sandwich, and the green beans and onions. Their ice cream was also delicious and they had a lot of flavors to choose from. All of it came out within a reasonable amount of time and our waitress was super friendly! Plus, at the end of the night I forgot my to go box and they ran outside to bring it to me. Super nice of them! I would say this place is great for families and friends."}
{"text":"This little spot is still hidden in Noda away from the other Noda specials by an entire block.  Still new, still working out the the kinks but a welcome neighborhood addition. Meet Randy, and he will play host for the evening and make sure you have a great welcome.   Menu is large, very large as are the portions. Expect nice and cozy atmosphere and hospitality.   It's a good change for the neighborhood with NJ style Italian food, but the desserts are where it is at. Expect home made, and with such a large menu, hard to do everything well, but they do a lot in a balanced and tasty fashion.. But pineapple carrot cake....omg."}
