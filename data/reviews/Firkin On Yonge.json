{"text":"Came in on a Saturday.  Staffing was clearly inadequate.  Food was so so and the server had way more tables than she could handle. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Great service and exciting atmosphere. 

It is a nice pub to go for drinks after work. Leaf games get fun..."}
{"text":"I've never had worse service. We never had the same person at our table twice. No one ever came to check how the food was. Even though they claim their burgers are never frozen the texture of the burger was that of something that was only partially defrosted. Everything they served had an odd texture. Myself and the rest of the party could no finish their meals either."}
{"text":"Crappy frozen food, crappy molson products 

No real english food, no real english beer. Or if it's supposed to be Canadian/English, why not add some Canadian microbreweries into the mix?

Servers more interested in each other than the tables, and a couple are just sour.

There are interesting bars in Toronto where you can find actual food/drink for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food and awesome staff. The beer bratz was delicious, am still craving it! The manager is extremely friendly and helpful, made an effort to come and talk to us. Definitely added to the experience. Had a great time and will definitely return in the near future."}
{"text":"I visit Toronto quite often and whenever I need to get some work done in a reasonably quiet (not as loud as a regular pub), I go here. They have wifi access and after lunch hours are not super busy (I usually go after 1pm until about 4pm). They have great drink specials, a wonderful staff and I'm certain I've met either the day manager or owner, who is also quite pleasantly wonderful. I would also recommend their food if you are into Irish pub eats (Irish nachos, wings, etc)."}
{"text":"Great service and great prices! Love coming here after work with friends. The draught is always cold and the Buffalo nachos are amazing."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs unless u r into rude patronizing bartender about 5 feet tall with a 10 foot attitude. Also avoid the pitchers as the picture of the pitcher is not what u get. Avoid the pimms o clock as it is nowhere near the recipe that is standard for pimms sad that you can't post without giving a star as this place does not deserve a star"}
{"text":"They are only getting one star because the two people I was with liked their food.

Let me start off by saying that I opened an account JUST so I could review this place. 
Came here yesterday, first the waitress took forever to just come get our drink orders and menus - about 15 minutes. When she took our orders we asked for water, about 10 minutes later she brought one glass of water - there were 3 of us. She came back 20 minutes later to check on us and we asked for two more glasses and she said \"yeah i think i can make that happen\"...I should hope so!

We waited about an hour for our food - a burger, eggs benny and a tator tot skillet thing - the restaurant was not THAT busy. We had to ask for our food to be checked on because it had already been an hour. My burger was charred, but i was starving at this point. I wanted some hot sauce for my onion rings, we literally waved at her for about 5 minutes and not one of the 3 people near her saw us. My friend ended up raising his hand up and leaving it there till she saw, another 5 minutes or so.

Finally, we motioned for the bill, she nodded and walked off. 10 minutes later she came back without the bill and asked if we needed anything else - \"yeah, the bill which you said you were bringing...\"

I couldn't help but chuckle out loud when the machine to pay was passed over, there is an automatic 20% tip option! If you are a restaurant with excellent service I am happy to tip 20%, but don't force your inflated tip option on me and still provide shitty service. 

I have been to many firkins before and enjoy the pub, this one unfortunately just has the worst service ever. I will not be going back and I will gladly tell my friends and colleagues to choose somewhere else if in the neighbourhood. I think this was probably my worst restaurant experience ever!!!"}
{"text":"For years, this has been my go-to pub for food and drinks before shows at Massey Hall. Always excellent service. They have cheap daily food AND beer specials every day! The house pilsner (Butlers) is pretty good for $5 a pint! Clean bathrooms. Nice decor. Large screens. Friendly servers. Yummy food. Thanks Firkin on Yonge!"}
{"text":"I thought I was socially awkward,  the servers here are
... Weird. The woman serving us to begin with went MIA after dropping off the food. When a bus guy finally came to take the plates I asked if I could order drinks from him and he said yeah, so I started telling him the order and then he walked off mid sentence, yet somehow still managed to bring the correct drinks
 Almost time for another round and still haven't seen our original server... I've never had such odd patchy service."}
{"text":"Wouldn't come here to watch a game... They turned the volume ALL the way down when we asked for them to turn it a little up!"}
{"text":"Standard pub food.  Friendly staff. 
They had a nice house salad with greens,  beats, pinenuts and goat cheese.  The beets were very underdone and tasted a bit raw. Other than that it wasn't too bad.  

My friend got the butter chicken pie,  which he said was good but slightly under salted. 

Overall,  a nice place."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here to check out this n that has opened up about 4 months. Still fairly new..but its not that special that makes me want to come back. We orders the currie fries..we thought it might be something different but it's just frozen fries with curry sauce on top..lol guess it was expected. We also wanted to try their cocktail pitcher and chose Rimm's. Pitcher was tiny and it was $20..over prices I have to say. Could've chosen the cocktails for $7.25, and it want as good as I expected it..your could find the same in other places with a reasonable price. Nice decor, service was alright."}
{"text":"I've held my birthday here three years in a row in the upstairs lounge perfect for about 20 people. Also a great place to watch sports and eat traditional pub food. Feels like you're in a pub in London"}
{"text":"Hit up the firkin after a day at work with some friends who finally made the trek downtown. We were split between beer (the guys) and the white sangria (the girls). 

I am a huge fan of their beer selection, they really do have a well rounded line up with some great hoppy beers (granville and barking squirrel) and some smoother ones (sleemans and rickards). I matched my pint with a spicy chicken wrap on a na'an which was dressed up with a great hot sauce that didn't overwhelm the beer or the na'an. 

The tellys were all tuned to one sports event or another (mainly olympics, but also a tennis tourny).

All in all a great atmosphere and definitely a good after work pub to hit up. 

total for the evening was under $25!"}
{"text":"I went there in September 2012. Nachos are bad. Sangria isn't good either. Service okay. My waitress didn't look very happy tho."}
{"text":"Food sucked, they served me a burnt burger. Drinks were super watered down. Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"We frequent Firkin often in the uptown locations and we decided to hit this location up since our group was out late. Place was busy but not too busy as the staff were quite attentive.

I had the Churros and Ice Cream which was just pretty much a big lie. Those weren't churros, meng. Those were donuts. The only thing that was churro-esque was the colour. That's it. Neither texture nor flavor were even close to it being churros. Good news, though: what they called \"ice cream\" really was ice cream. 2/5."}
{"text":"Went to the Firkin on Yonge last night. It was alright. Nothing special, definitely a chain or Corporate feel to it.

 It is a \"British Style Pub\" with your typical pub food but it is mediocre.  I had wings and fries, both were more or less mailed in, the beer selection was not what it should be for a British pub. Come to think or it, I don't think they had any British beer on tap (perhaps Kilkenny was the closest it got).

Wait staff was fine, but I had to ask for a wet nap after the wings. That seemed odd for a place like that.

Anyways, go there but don't expect the venue to make you night....bring good friends"}
{"text":"I came here to grab a bite with my aunt while we downtown.  I had a butter chicken pot pie and she had the shepards pie which was on special for $7.  The butter chicken pot pie was delicious.  We each also ordered a 20 oz beer since they too were on special for $5.  Ended the meal with hot slice of chocolate cake with ice cream which you can never go wrong with.  The place was a little loud at times but it is more of a sports bar and the walls are covered with TVs.  I would probably come back to watch a game with friends but since the prices are reasonable but other than that it's very similar to other sports bars.  If you're in the area and looking for bite you can't go wrong with this place.  Only caveat is that the service is a bit slow."}
{"text":"Very solid experience, and among the upper tier of Firkin locations I've visited.

I came here with friends a couple months back, as we were on our way to dinner but were finding that most of the nearby restaurants were packed solid. Luckily, we came across this restaurant by chance, and the very polite server mentioned that they had a table for us. We actually got in just in time to see a UFC fight that was playing on the monitors above the booths.

Firkin on Yonge has a very laid-back, intimate vibe to it. Despite getting full later on, it's the rare restaurant where I can say that you could still hear yourself talk despite the noise. Everyone in my group just had a very relaxed, chill time, and we had dinner and drinks before calling it a night. Only complaint? The seating is a tad too cramped, but otherwise, no major complaints.

I had a bottle of beer, the fish and chips and the apple crumble, and was impressed by how light the batter was. It was a very satisfying meal, and the price (just shy of $30) was about what I expected.

Very solid experience overall, and I will definitely be back if I'm in the area.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but service is extremely slow. Had to ask for the bill 3 times, and it still took forever to pay. I get that it's Friday night, but when you have 3 or 4 hostess standing around really doesn't paint a good picture. Don't think I'll ever come back, just too infuriating."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and their sangrias are delicious! Please do note that it's always packed so you might have to wait a few minutes before getting seated, but worth the wait :)."}
{"text":"We stopped by for drinks and dessert on a Saturday night, and it was very busy but we still had decent service. It has typical pub decor and atmosphere, and we were able to watch a basketball game on one of the TVs. It looked like you could enter the pub from a back door entrance as well.

The good: They had Kronenbourg 1664! I was so excited to see my favorite French beer on tap that I ignored any specials they had (rotates nightly with a separate food and drink special).

The meh: The salted caramel chocolate lava cake was good, but not really a lava cake with molten anything inside. It was more like a large moist brownie with salted caramel on top.

Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes, if they're looking for someplace in the downtown area to grab a few drinks and hang out."}
{"text":"came here after the first Kevin hart show, and was surprised to be seated right away, especially for a long weekend Saturday.

we were a group of 4 and had amazing service by a gentleman with a beard (sorry to have forgotten his name, I'm late with my review).

we had two apps shared and my friends had dinner - chicken tenders and wings.

the service was quick and the food was good for bar food. 

only suggestion I have is making the Shepard's Pie with Lamb - not everyone eats beef :("}
{"text":"They definitely have beer. The ambience is that of any normal pub. The evening I was there it was quite packed and I stayed for a few hours. The people at the bar( workers and locals) were friendly. Wasn't expecting such lively, and long, conversations. Toronto on-the-whole feels like a giant Steele and glass box, but the firkin was a lot warmer. The food was decent too, I'd go back the next time I see another one- I always see them at airports"}
{"text":"Les firkin sont apprecies pour leur espace et leur service rapide. On en demande pas plus.

Firkin are appreciated for their space and fast orders, I do not ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Very simple. The busier it was the better the service got. The food was ok. They advertise a Ghost Pepper Sauce. well... I'm not going to get into it but it's not quite that. They mix with Franks. Half of the dish was cold the fries included. 

Anyway, I'm split down the middle. Will I return? Maybe. That is pretty much explains my opinion. Because sure. Why not?

Try the FlatIron & Firkin or Churchmouse & Firkin just a few blocks away in either direction for a bit more atmosphere."}
{"text":"It all started while casually looking for an establishment that had Barking Squirrel on Tap!  Yep, we were on our way from Chinatown to the Elgin & Winter Garden Theatre for the backstage tour, and we're heading down Younge keeping our eyes open for a good place to grab dinner after the tour.  When on vacation we try to stay away from big chain restaurants and we just happened to glance at the menu outside the entrance while walking by.  Not only did the food selections look good, but they had the \"Squirrel\"!

Firkin on Younge can get a bit noisy, but it is a pub atmosphere.  We were seated quickly towards the back, away from the bar and waited on right away.  If all the servers are as quick and attentive as ours (\"Roop\"), then this location knows what it's doing.  Prices are good (remember you're in heart of a major metropolitan city), and the food is great.  We happened to be there on a Thursday night, but even so, it was somewhat busy.  I can only imagine what a weekend evening is like.  So if you're in the neighborhood, treat yourself, skip the food court, and head to Firkin on Younge."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that this is just another Firkin, I had somewhat high hopes for this location as it's pretty new and I like how the front of the pub opens up to the street in the summer (I hope this trend continues along Yonge as more restaurants open!).

I really like the pub in terms of the layout and the furniture. The \"look at us, we're so BRIT-ISH\" decor is pretty awful though. When we came in, there were quite a few people watching a euro football match though, so it does seem to be performing a useful British-pub-like function for the area.

In terms of food, we had the pull pork slides, the chicken curry poutine and the veggie burger. The pulled pork sliders were ok, but the white bread buns were a bit too stiff. They were cheap so I won't complain, but they were still a bit small. The curry poutine didn't really work. Too much going on -- I would have rather just had the curry or the poutine on its own. The veggie burger was a bit stiff and it was overdone. The bottom was pretty black in places.

Average beer list. Decent service."}
{"text":"Went here with a group following a board of directors meeting for a quick holiday drink.  I can't get over how rude one of the waitresses was to our group.  It was busy, but she was beyond snarky and sharp.  I won't ever come back."}
{"text":"A pretty cool bar to head to if you're having an evening out. We decided to drop by after a meal, but it was pretty crowded downstairs. On of the bartenders recommended that our large party go upstairs as they had a lounge area, but no servers. We would just have to get our drinks ourselves and bring them up.

The seating upstairs was AWESOME! There was one section that had multiple large couches, and they were quite comfortable. Unfortunately, the staff there need a better form of communication. We had been sitting upstairs as some of us went down for drinks, when a waitress came up to tell us (in a rather rude fashion) that we could not sit up here. At this point, we were confused and went back downstairs, only to have a different waitress tell us it was okay to be up there.

Not the greatest service, especially when not all staff are on the same page, but it all ended up fine. A good bar to hangout nonetheless."}
{"text":"A mid afternoon stop proved to be decent.  Had pulled pork grilled cheese, everything was as expected and flavor presentation above average for 14$.  Service was excellent and the front windows open for nice weather."}
{"text":"Looks good on the outside - inside is cool and the staff are really nice! Came here alone to a handshake and intro from the barman - nice touch 10/10 dude..! Nice to have a beer, a chill and a watch of the hockey on big screen, not an English pub though!!! Thank God..!"}
{"text":"Yet another great place in Toronto to have a drink!  Staff were great and the drinks were reasonable and cold! Did not eat but it did look good. Lots of televisions to watch sports on too!"}
{"text":"This spot is right in the middle of tourist-land. 

Eric and I were looking for a patio nearby and spotted a seat right at the window, which is almost like a patio. It's great for people watching, but it was crazy busy on a Friday evening, so service was a bit harried. Drinks, as expected, are pricier than they'd be in a non-chain location. The best thing that happened was a homeless man walked by and swiped a lady's burger from her plate while she was having a smoke. Hilarity!"}
{"text":"went here for st patty's day after we saw a line up to the irish embassy pub.... 

it's just an ok pub - doesn't really have an authentic irish feeling to it but is well lit and is roomy. 
we were a group of 10 and didn't have a problem finding a table for us.

food is ok, and there is a variety of bear selection."}
{"text":"Holy poutine! The bartender said it was the best in the city and he was not lying! I only had a plate of poutine and two beers, but the food was good and the beer was cold. My service was quick, efficient and so, so, SO friendly! It was a great stop on my \"Tour of Toronto\"! The free wifi also allowed me to check in with my friends in the States!"}
{"text":"Was done work early and waiting for a friend downtown so I bar-flied it up, ordering drinks and talking about dumb stuff to the fairly busy staff.

I was impressed on how I was neither snubbed by the staff nor serving as a distraction from serving the other customers.

The beer selection was not exactly exotic or super interesting but it did still have a decent selection of good beers.

I would definitely drink here if I was in the area again"}
{"text":"Stopped by here to catch up with a friend.  It's a relatively new pub across from Eaton Centre.  We sat on the upper level which is very roomy with a sectioned off area at the back for functions.  Bathrooms are in the basement so if your on the upper level you have to take the elevator or walk down the stairs to the basement.  Washrooms and basement area was very clean. I ordered the wings and fries it was a decent portion although the fries were tepid.  Serving portions are adequate if not on the smallish side.  They had a martini special for $6.00 for a ridiculously small drink that was very very weak-- not worth the 6 bucks at all.  Atmosphere is your typical pub.  Its dark with lots of velvet.  Nice place to duck into to get off the busy strip for a bite but not any place to go out of your way to visit."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. How long does it take you to bring a beer and a fricken debit machine. The answer...a very long time. Do they not want to get paid?"}
{"text":"Went here last night. Had wings smallest around. Wings no good too small to eat. They don't have chilled glasses for their beer either. My wife had the fish tacos very good!!"}
{"text":"I can't say I was disappointed with our experience here, but it was only average. I ended up having a burger and fries, which was good but nothing special. Others had nachos, some had wings. No one complained about the food, the staff were nice, atmosphere was OK. I would go back if I was in the area, but would not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Once you don't get the blonde girl with a Mohawk who never smiles then it is ok for a beer. If you do get her just leave because she is so rude"}
{"text":"The service was mediocre. The girl serving us didn't seem to care when my friend was asking about a certain food item on the menu. I ordered sweet potato fries which the server told me was $5. When we got the bill, it was $8. The sauce it came with looked like it had been sitting out all day. There was an oxidized crust on top and the inside of the sauce waa lighter in color. The fries itself were good. My friend and I were bar hopping and we've never been to this place. I probably wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"AWESOME place. My Wife and I stopped in for a little bit to eat and walked out stuffed. Had an awesome mimosa as well as a coffee flavored drink on the brunch menu. the App was HUGE. I wish we would have had more time and room in our belly's for more foodage.

Get the app called \"Bucket of rings and things\" see the pic to understand.

We will had no problems coming back next time we are a little peckish and in need of a tasty Alcoholic drink."}
{"text":"Found myself here while wasting time waiting for someone by the Eaton Centre. Cannot comment on the food, but they have a good selection of taps and a nice atmosphere. It's obviously a pub but doesn't fall into being dark and dingy like many do. Good service and a nice atmosphere with a decent number of screens."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my coworkers. Together we ordered wings, perogies, fish tacos, and poutine. We so had some sliders the size of quarters.

The service was fine and the place looked like a pub. The food was terrible. This is the worst pub food I have eaten at in my whole life. I can make better pub food at home. The equivalent frozen foods products at supermarkets tastes better. No amount of beer could make their food taste even anything close to descent. Get a new chef or new kitchen please."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I received the worst Moscow Mules of our life, here. I could not even finish my drink because of the overpowering ginger flavor that burned the inside of the my throat and up my nose. 

I'm sure there are far better bars/restaurants to go to than this spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came here with friends during a busy TIFF night and they had room for our large group of 8.  We were turned away rudely by another place after waiting for a table for 20 minutes, and decided to come here instead.  Great food, service, and a fantastic dark ambiance that was very comforting.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend out for lunch on Aug 15 2015 to this place. We always choose this place love the atmosphere. I ordered the London Porker and we'll what can I say? It tasted awful, it taste like a permanent marker and all Chemical like. This place usually has great food but I couldn't finish it.
Had to throw it out. 
The service was great even though a Jay game was playing and it was busy.."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a sports bar with different kinds of seating.  Billed as a British pub, as a Brit I am pleased to say its nothing like a British pub .  

An excellent range of drinks, including Guinness and cider..."}
{"text":"I had a chance to taste their tacos, as well as sweet potato fries. The fries was pretty good, the fish taco was okay... The chicken taco wasn't great at all: it was blend and had a weird texture.

We happen to visit Firkin around 9 pm, and I guess the staff wasn't happy about working the late shift on Boxing Day. When we entered the restaurant, no one greater us and the host seemed indifferent. The waiter was nice though, despite having to work on a holiday. 

The place was empty. They have lots of TVs at the restaurant, which is a plus. Prices are all right, reasonable for downtown Toronto.

Overall, the food was okay and the service was so-so. This place is okay as a one-time thing, but I probably wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"A bunch of my friends and I came here for dinner just before seeing Grease the Musical. We sat upstairs on the top level so there wasn't much ambiance. We shared some calamari which was kind of typical of what you'd get at an average pub. I got the ghost pepper wings and they delivered on the heat; very crispy, well-seasoned and cooked fully through.

The only major con I have is that the bathrooms are way down in basement and the stairs are very steep. Maybe it's because I was in heels, but after a few drinks or so, you'd better be careful!"}
{"text":"This review is for drink service only: we didn't eat there. Four of us sat at a table in the back. The ambiance was great, almost like a modern, brightly-colored, artsy modernized version of a British pub. But it worked. The drinks were strong and our waitress was wonderful."}
{"text":"Firkin is a great place to have dinner and drinks.  It has good food, decent drinks, and a great atmosphere!  I came here after shopping with some friends at Eaton Centre and sitting down in their plush booths felt amazing.  My friends said their mixed drinks weren't that great because they were watered down but overall were decent.  However the food and service more than made up for the drinks. 

I only ordered an appetizer since I wasn't hungry but was satisfied with my choice.  I ordered  Yorkshire pudding stuffed with short rib on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Everything was flavored just right and the portion was decently sized for an appetizer.  

The service was great.  We had a hilarious Johnny Depp-esque waiter who took care of us.  He checked on us many times throughout the night to make sure we had everything we needed.  

I had a great experience and would go back if I was back in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"I had the nachos and wings here. Nothing too spectacular, pretty average. The wings and drumsticks were tiny..by tiny I mean they can fit into my mouth entirely...

Our waitress seemed like she had a long day, but she did follow up with us with our drinks pretty frequently. Drinks here are much better than the food, not too watered down, but they did take a while to come.

I wouldn't recommend coming here for dinner, but for a drink and something to munch on, it's not too bad."}
{"text":"I had lunch there with a friend on Tuesday.  Lots of suits.

We both had chicken fingers ... they were chicken fingers, nothing special.

Our server was friendly and fun ... apparently my friend goes there quite often for lunch.  

Nothing bad about the place ... nothing special either."}
{"text":"Good place.  We stopped in twice to have a beer and watch the world cup.  Appetizers were good and everything was reasonably priced.  Lots of TVs well placed for good viewing.   Service was on the mark and friendly as well.  I'd go back when in the area."}
{"text":"On our second day visiting Toronto, my family and I found ourselves at the Firkin On Yonge for dinner. The Firkin Pubs chain operates roughly 30 restaurants throughout Ontario. This location is just south of the Yonge-Dundas Square, in the heart of the city.

The Firkin On Yonge offers two levels of bars and dining sections. A decent selection on Canadian craft beer is available on tap. I had the Mad & Noisy Brewing Hops & Bolts IPL, while my wife enjoyed the Hop City Brewing Barking Squirrel.

The menu is a solid mix of British style pub food along with a selection of Indian influenced dishes. I had the London porker sandwich with pulled pork, bacon, apple coleslaw, and Keen's English mustard on brioche bun and a side of fries ($14). I could have used a little more pulled pork on the sandwich, but what I did have was pretty good.

My wife had the chicken curry ($11 small/$16 large), a very solid curry dish over basmati rice, which was a better choice overall. A kids menu is also offered, making a good place to take the whole family."}
{"text":"Cool Food, Great Staff, and Nice beer/Drink selection"}
{"text":"Ordered a serving of the mild and honey barbecue wings and both were great. Really can never go wrong with wings. Also had the waffle and ice cream dessert which was nothing that you can't create at home, but fairly tasty and good for the value (5 bucks, which I split with a friend). 

A fairly plentiful selection on tap, service was sublime. Very welcoming & comforting atmosphere and enjoyed the music as well. Gets quite busy after 6pm, that's when they crank up the volume (it gets quite loud)! 

If you want a no-frills place to eat after work, then this is your place.Appreciate that the owners always respond to comments on Yelp and Google Reviews!"}
{"text":"Place is OK, but I had to go & get salt & pepper from a table & get up & ask for cutlery, while being served at the bar. Also, sitting here forever for someone to take my bill & bring me some change. 

This is crazy; other bars aren't like this!"}
{"text":"Found this place after passing my OTL license. And my colleagues and I decided to celebrate with shots and beer at 11:30 am. (we had studied for 8+ hours on the daily for 2 and a half weeks, give us a break).

At the time, we were all hungry, and mentally drained. So anything filling our stomachs was great. For myself, I had a shot of Jack Daniels, a coors light, and a pound of wings.

I was more or less disappointed by the pound of wings. it was about $10+ and came with veggie sticks (not many). needless to say. I was not full. That's something to consider i guess. wings as an app, sure veggie sticks. wings as an entree, serve it with a filler like fries, those don't cost much."}
{"text":"Nothing bad but, then again, nothing special about this cookie cutter pub.  The beer is cold and the food is average."}
{"text":"This is a decent sports bar, two floors and very friendly wait staff.  They take reservations.  We had booked a table of 6 for game 7 of Leafs playoffs and there were no issues.

Wednesday evening is $6 Molson Canadians and Half Priced Wings.  I ended up ordering a pint but opted for the $18.99 calamari/shrimp which had fried green beans.  The order came with a dill sauce and was good--but it was a lot of friedness.

The bathroom is located in the basement so there are a lot of stairs to climb if you're seated on the second floor.

There is a large screen which projects the main event, in this case being the Toronto Maple Leafs game 7 but there are many TV screens throughout the venue.

The churros and ice cream was delicious!  For a sports bar, definitely decent."}
{"text":"Arranged for an event here. First and last time. Service was extremely slow and inattentive - looked like they had one person covering the entire second floor, so perhaps not necessarily the fault of the server. What I would however fault the server for was bringing 5 plates, utensils and napkins when there were 12 at the table, on the rare occasion we actually saw her. When we did, it was clear her patience was strained when she kept trying to walk away before we finished an order.

What also surprised me was that she had the nerve to bring me a single when I ordered a double, on two occasions, even when I asked. It was quite evident as one of my guests had ordered a double which was, well, clearly double the amount. I was charged for doubles as well. Same happened with a beer - supposed to be a pint but clearly a half pint. I was puzzled by this - not sure if the server just didn't give a crap or if it was me in particular she didn't approve of. I didn't raise a stink as it was an event for one of my colleagues.

Suffice it to say that I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good food. Good vibe. Reasonable prices. I'd eat here again for sure. Stay away from the $20 pitchers though. Not a good value."}
{"text":"My dad and I visited this place before our concert at Massey Hall last night - he's been here a couple of times and I've only been here once - but we both really enjoyed ourselves! The atmosphere is great, and the fact that the back hall leads right to the venue was perfect. The food was surprisingly REALLY good (I just got the nachos to split, since I wasn't that hungry) and the waitress we had was super friendly and accommodating! They also were playing MGMT (the concert we were seeing that night) all throughout the meal, which really topped it off for us! My only complaint was that I got 2 or 3 double rum and cokes, and it felt a little weak compared to what I normally get elsewhere, which was kind of disappointing. However, if you have an event at Massey Hall, or any of the theatres in the area, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Came back in Nov. 2016 and the music was very appropriate for a British-esc pub. :) 


Over the top Union Jacks and a picture of Twiggy draws you in. Once inside, they have a great staff and all the libations. The one problem is that the carpet doesn't match the drapes. If you're going to display British beauty, play appropriate music. Cancon Trag Shit can kiss my ass."}
{"text":"I went here for an after work social, and the waitresses did not seem to pay us any attention.

The food was average, although we had just ordered finger foods like wings, nachos, and fries.

The drinks are decent, and the venue is not bad, but the lack of attention from the servers really made the experience sour."}
{"text":"Always a great place to count on for plans and a great connection with friends. Good food and a fairly good beer section. 

By far the best thing about this place is the location. In the heart of yonge across from TEC"}
{"text":"I really really REALLY enjoyed this place. The servers were really nice and personable, the food was amazing, and the beer... Okay selection but they have 

GRANVILLE ISLAND PALE ALE on tap. One of my favourites. Stoked about stumbling upon this place and I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"A British pub that takes the best of the traditional English style pub and couples it with what makes Canadian bars great. ie. It looks English inside, but has many, many TVs all over the place so you can be sure to catch whichever game you want to watch.

The food is ok. Nothing special, but certainly not bad. Definitely better than many other bars I've eaten in in the surrounding areas. There is a huge upstairs, which has a section that can be roped off for private parties. When I went the waitresses were attentive and friendly."}
