{"text":"Shredded Chicken and General Tsos... very bland!!!!   Menu is very basic. The prices are a little above average and certainly not worth it.  Tasteless.  Very disappointed.. never again One star is being nice."}
{"text":"We've been ordering take-out from Hunan Wok since I was in elementary school (15 years or so), and with good reason. It's the best Chinese I've had anywhere, and I've had my fair share. The service is quick, friendly, simple... and it's got an added level of charm because it's family owned and run. I have an out of state friend who visits every so often, and every time, Hunan Wok is one of the places we just HAVE to hit. Amazing food, great service, and family based; that's the type of business I want to support."}
{"text":"Very tasty well made chinese cuisine, go with the take out route rather than eating in...try the Hunan wok special soup and fried rice...extra spicy."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. GREAT FOOD! Always tasty and delicious. Usually get at least 2 free additional egg rolls with your order. The girl that answers the phone is very good. Never messes up the order. Delicious specialties and soups, also."}
{"text":"Our Go to for Robinson and Kennedy good value and the family that runs it are awesome.   Try it out  curry beef"}
{"text":"Went for first time yesterday for take out lunch. Ordered hot & sour soup & Hunan noodles. Soup was fine - pretty standard. Noodles... tasted like MSG was dominant flavor and greasy as all get out. Soaked through the bag. Explosive you-know-what 2 hours later."}
{"text":"My sister and I eat here all the time and we've never had a bad experience. The staff is friendly. The food is delicious, reasonably priced, and prepared quickly. They always give us extra stuff with our dinner orders like free cheesesteak egg rolls and a 2 liter. I can't recommend this place enough! Try the Hunan Wok lo mein or fried rice with crab rangoons. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hunan Wok is a strip mall Chinese joint in Kennedy Township. When walking in, you are overwhelmed by the smell of cleaning products, how dimly lit it is and a lot of the signage and calendars are dusty/dirty(-1  overall appearance) , just not real appealing. It was around 2:30 and empty. I ordered L24 General Tso's, yea I know, real adventurous, but I do ask for it Hot every time.  I was told 15 minutes, it took 20 and they were dead slow(-1). The General Tso's was about as flavorless as you could get and o, so dry(-1).  The Pork Fried Rice was actually Pork Burnt Rice, nasty(-1). I also ordered Boneless Ribs, which were pretty good. Not a lot of fat on them. Ended up paying $13 for a lunch special that didn't come with a drink(-1). Overall, odds of going back are a lot slimmer than me."}
{"text":"Ordered the General Tso it was so heavy breaded and absolutely no flavor or heat.  Pork rice was okay but the egg roll was double rolled and tasteless. Really unhappy so need a good McKees Rocks Asian restaurant. Plus they do not deliver."}
