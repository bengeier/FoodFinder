{"text":"This is easily one of the best places to eat that I've found in Montreal so far.  A very pleasant surprise after some really lousy experiences.  The food portions were quite large and of a quality that easily outclassed anything else we've bumped into here.  The place is unpretentious and pleasant.  We weren't treated like tourists ripe to be fleeced - take note Montreal pubs and restaurants!  Alisha was a lovely host who made us feel right at home - way to go John Michael's - great food, great staff!"}
{"text":"These people do not know the first thing about running a restaurant. Here's our story. My wife and I went there on a Monday around 3:00pm. There were only a few tables filled. The greeter was yawning and said she was out partying late the previous night. Should have ran.... Anyways, we were seated and were brought a couple of waters and my wife ordered a drink. She said it tasted like something premixed. Not good at all. We then ordered our lunch. Finally it came. The poutine was less than acceptable, the cheese sticks and smoked meat sandwich I'm sure we're bought at Costco. And the romaine on my Caesar Salad was limp and not crunchy. It the meantime my water had been sitting empty for most of the meal. When we got the bill, and I was going to pay in cash, they weren't sure if they could make the change. They did. I did tip the waitress about 15%, probably shouldn't have, what did it for me was she was already counting the tip before she left the table. If the restaurant wasn't in a touristy area, they would have been long gone. Definitely not up to Montreal standards."}
{"text":"Went here with my family because Le Fripon wasn't open. Sad to say that the trade off wasn't great. Service was adequate. And my veggie burger was pretty good. But $16 is overpriced, even for a tourist spot. Add to that the $4 sodas--and a beer menu that was apparently drawn up by someone who either hates or doesn't understand beer--and you make this reviewer very sad. This is 2017 and adjunct lagers and Murphy's do not a draft list make. Probably one of the worst values for money deals to be had in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"It's the Fourth of July in the states and we are in Montreal.  But we are here also to celebrate 150 years of Canada.  We were looking for an easy dinner.  We came upon the John Michaels Pub (JMP) in the square known as Place Jacques Cartier for the street entertainers.  We took a front seat and watched as a dancer did her Spanish flamingo and a guitar player strummed his music in another corner, while a saxophonist blew soft and slow melodies. I ordered the famous Montreal smoked meat sandwich and the lovely missus had the cheeseburger.  We didn't mind waiting for our order as the crowd got larger and larger.  It is the peak of dinner time.  The young girls waiting on us were busy and finally our orders came.  I was definitely disappointed.  Smoked meats were not piled high as described and the thin slices of rye bread was old and chewy.  I didn't know any better until much later that this is not the way to serve the smoked meat sandwich.  The cheeseburger, however, came as it should, a mountain of a burger with plenty of cheese and burger patty.  The top bun was nicely burned with the JMP logo.  So, a review half and half would make it two and a half stars.  The front seats to a crowded plaza made it barely a three."}
{"text":"I tried this place on my last night based on reviews and wanted a pub setting. I was taken care of by Julian. It was a Sunday night and pretty dead. The wings were very good but a little small. I moved on to the ribs. OMG fall of the bone and seasoned just right with not too much sauce. The fries were perfectly cooked.  Place has a small bar with a nice selection of draft beers and six TV screens. The location can't be beat, right in the heart of the Old Town.  I will be back on my next trip here. Oh yeah, they got wifi"}
{"text":"Initially I was upset about not being served however I would give this restaurant another go after Don immediately messaged me. I want to thank him for handling the matter professionally. Few restaurant owners and managers take the initiative to apologize to their customers on yelp so I very much appreciated the gesture. The restaurant is in a beautiful location, it is clean and the interior and patio had a nice warm feel."}
{"text":"Vous cherchez l'endroit où boire la bière plus chère de Montréal? C'est ici ! 8$ pour une DEMI pinte de IPA.  En extra, vous pourrez profiter d'une atmosphère digne du terminus d'autobus de région.  De plus, sur la facture, on suggère aux touristes de payer 18 % de pourboire. Note à nos visiteurs : 15 %  est largement suffisant pour signifier notre appréciation partout au Québec.   (Le club sandwich et les frites étaient ok...)"}
{"text":"This Pub made a rainy day bright. Stopped in for lunch and a beer. Great menu. Asked for a recommendation from the bartender/waitress and was very satisfied. Next time I will have to try the poutine. It looked very tasty. Good food and beer. Thanks again Alisha for the great service"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much and they delivered that. It's mainly a tourist restaurant on the most touristy street in the city. I got the impression it was an Irish pub, but it's just a pub. No Guinness on tap, they do have another dark alternative on tap. All beers are Molson varieties. No micro breweries which would have been nice. We were 8 people and it took over an hour to get served. I had a fish and chip. A generous portion of fries and the batter was crispy on the fish. Friend ordered a sub and the bun wasn't toasted, so bread got soggy quick. Salmon tartare had a lot of julienne veggies and wasn't anything special.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Had an awesome meal and experience at John Michael's! Delicious food, awesome drinks and amazing service! Great location as well! Thanks."}
{"text":"Came with 6 friends Took a long time just to get our orders in.. Got 5 poutine orders and 2 cheeseburgers. Weren't asked how we would like our burgers and they came Out super well done and dry and the poutine seemed like it was all microwaved and then just thrown together..spend ur money elsewhere"}
{"text":"Do not eat here or order a mixed drink! 1) the lime in my Cosmo was so dry I was only able to squeezed three drops out of it. 2) food arrived and I had to ask for utensils  3) there's salt and pepper shakers on the table, because the foods so bland and you will need to pep it up. 4) the hostess looked like she was hungover- her long hair was stringy and not brushed...eww. 5) our bill was $55.17, we paid with a $100 bill and the waitress cringed and replied saying \"I don't know if I have enough cash to break that\".  6) the staff was friendly in welcoming, but that quickly wore off once we placed our food order....guess they figured we were 'hooked'. 7) the waitress opened the cheque book at out table, in front of us- to see if we had tipped her. (We did, tipped here $8 for our horrible time) 8) I didn't even finish my food, it was dull."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance! J'ai adoré la nourriture. Il ne faut pas se fier aux commentaires, super expérience!"}
{"text":"Food less than adequate and service was substandard. Save yourself the grief and go somewhere else.  Wait staff disappears!"}
{"text":"OMG avoid at all costs. It looked packed when we got there at 1:30 for lunch but it was empty on the inside.   We placed our order, nachos to start and then burgers/sandwiches. It took 30+ min for the nachos to come out, then another 45 for our entrees. We almost walked out. The food was edible, but if you like your burger not charred to a crisp I'd skip this spot.   Getting any of the staff to come to your table was a hassle too. We waited 20 minutes for the check and had to wave down the hostess to get it.   Such a tourist trap because of the location. Avoid it at all costs."}
{"text":"Basically, this place sucked. My wife and I popped in for dinner because they had patio seating where we could people watch on the square. The tables were so jammed together that we could hardly moved. We had to ask for menus and utensil. The waitress took our order and disappeared. We waited for what seemed like forever for my beer and her wine. They showed up about the same time ash the food. My fish and chips consisted mainly of a large pile of what were clearly grocery store frozen fries. They delivered six small packets of catsup. I asked for more and the guy left and never came back. There are too many other places within a 2-3 minute walk to waste your time here."}
{"text":"This place has a great location but it really goes down from there and becomes a tourist trap. The waiter was pretty nice and patient but at the same time the food took long even though it looked like inside was empty and everyone was sitting in the terasse.   The whole menu is pretty overpriced due to the location so I went with the chicken poutine which was $18. The chicken was pretty dry and the whole poutine was below average. Overall, I would not come back."}
{"text":"Like many restaurants in Montreal, they do not have the most diverse menu available.  The selections are limited, so you need to make sure you'll find something you'll like.  But, what they have, they do well.  The location is great - right along a pedestrian walkway that ends towards the waterfront.  The food is good.  The Louisiana Chicken is grilled and has a good sauce on it.  The Salmon was a bit under-seasoned.  They have really good French Fries though, so bonus points.    The outdoor seating is a little tight.  The service is a bit slow.  But, overall, it's a decent option."}
{"text":"They did not charge a cover to come here during the New Year and we able to just order drinks. Several other places would not let us order drinks unless we bought food so I appreciated that. It had a cute feel and we were served rather quickly.  We did not order food, but they had a decent beer selection.  Overall, I had a pleasant experience and our waiter was very quick especially considering it was December 31st! I will be back if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"J'ai mangé les tacos au poisson et au poulet effiloché : un délice ! Ils étaient bien meilleurs que ceux de plusieurs restaurants qui se spécialisent dans les tacos que j'ai eu la chance d'essayer. J'ai bien hâte d'y retourner pour essayer autre chose. Aussi, ils ont un grand verre de bière de 1L en forme de botte pour 12$ !"}
