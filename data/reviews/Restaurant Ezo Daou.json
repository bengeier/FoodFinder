{"text":"We celebrated my sister's Bridal Shower here. It accomodates more than 50 ladies comfortably. The place is clean and a grey canvas to decorate with the pop of color of your choice. Family-owned, the staff is incredibly friendly and the food was family style to share. Shoutout to Rita who was a great help and lovely to work with."}
{"text":"The most AUTHENTIC Lebanese restaurant in Montreal! 
The family that runs the place is very accommodating and friendly.
The food is amazing and fresh. 
Another thing that was outstanding was the service. 
Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Simply the best!!!! Amazing Lebanese food. 
Authentic and fresh. 
Try the fattouch salad and mixed grill plate. 
Hummus is also really good. Cant go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Recently went to this resto with a group of friends and was quite impressed. Definately lived up to expectations and reputation. If you are looking for a resto that serves authentic lebanese food , then you must try this resto.Great for groups and lovely modern decor. Food is totally awesome and not expensive at all for it's great quality. Would recommend the sharing platter for 35$ per person so you can try all their wonderful dishes. Grilled chicken, baba ganoush, hummus , vine leaves packed with wonderful flavors and worth the visit to this resto. Last but not least must not forget to mention their truly great baklava!...Good service as well."}
{"text":"Reading older reviews can be so confusing sometimes. I came in expecting great lebanese cuisine similar to what I've experienced elsewhere in Montreal or perhaps even better but ultimately we left quite underwhelmed.

Our dining experience :

Fattouch salad - Decent but completely lacked the zest a fattouch salad should have. Also was the pita fried? I much prefer it being baked and with the salad dressing it was quite soggy instead of crunchy. This is a different take to the traditional salad.

Feuillte : The cheese was perfect, very yummy. Probably the best thing we ate.

Falafel : Decent but felt it was fried a bit too long thus making it crunchier than expected.

Meat Leaves : They were very dry and thus not good at all.

Meat Plate : The variety of meats were good, with the filet mignon being the best. Chicken was decent. Kebbe was decent. Why just one stick? Shrimp decent. Garlic was way off, wayyyyy too much garlic, no flavor. Fries were good.

Katayef : Was good but filling was economic.

Lebanese coffee : Was good but was served over 20 minutes after our dessert? Also we got enough coffee in our pot for 6+ people! We were only 3!

Service was decent but they need to ensure courses are served at the same time. Coffee needs to go with dessert.

Price-tag is very high and not good value. Our meal for 4 was $150 + tip. We had much better elsewhere for under $125 with tip.

Maybe they were better in the past? Either way on a Saturday night it was about 1/3 full. This was a clue I think.

2.5 Stars rounded down."}
{"text":"Howdy!

Nice, solid Lebanese food. Large portions, reasonably priced. Unfortunately stuck in a horribly inconvenient location if you are car-less. On the other hand, if you live in ville Saint Laurent this should be your go to place for Baba ghanoush and grilled meats."}
{"text":"A must try!! Puts all other middle eastern restaurants to shame. Try their creamy homemade hummus, wow, best ever!
Service was great too! Music on point. 
Will be back with more people for sure"}
{"text":"Very dissapointing experience! I was invited for a Baptism & I got there at 4pm the food only came an hour & a half later. For the number of guests per table there wasn't enough food & the taste was not that great. I am Lebanese & know very well leabanese food, my taste buds were unsatisfied! It is an overated resto"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Lebanese food and great service. It is a tragedy that more people don't know about this place. Please go eat there you won't be disappointed. Try the seafood platter and the fatouche salad!"}
{"text":"Restaurant situé sur l'Acadie, en face du Marché central, de spécialité libanaise. Nous l'avons essayé pour l'anniversaire d'une amie.Nous avons pris des assiettes à partager celle aux fruits de mer (crevettes géantes, calmars, pieuvre grille) ainsi que celle à la viande (bronchettes de viande, filet mignon, poulet grillé), le tout accompagné de frites délicieuses au prix de 55$ chaque plateau et nous avons ajouté en extra une assiette de houmous, une grande salade fatoush et des feuilles de vigne farcies à la viande. Un d'entre nous avait des allergies au gluten et les serveurs ont su se montrer très flexible à ce sujet et on pu nous accommoder. Le service était très courtois et amaible. L'endroit était charmant quoi que vide. J'ai été surprise de trouver ce restaurant si calme un samedi soir car la nourriture y est excellente, fraîche et diversifiée. Nous avons bien mange! Je le recommande :)"}
{"text":"Excellent Lebanese food in a nice atmosphere. The service was friendly and efficient. The prices are good value. I found the \"regular\" mideastern dishes to be very well prepared and very tasty.  The mixed platter of several dishes is very good. I will return soon."}
{"text":"This is the place for Lebanese food. Always fresh and tasty. Always great service. Nice modern interior design."}
