{"text":"FINNALY!! We found an amazing sushi bar near Parma!! This is a quaint and very clean eatery with wonderful service and extremely good food!! We've been there twice now and plan on making this a regular date-night destination."}
{"text":"The first time I drove by Mizu, I couldn't help but wonder how on earth a sushi restaurant located in a dive strip center between a check-cashing/carryout establishment and a Subway could possibly be worth trying.  However, after reading other reviews I decided to give it a try.  Being from Cincinnati, I was eager to find a good sushi restaurant while working in Cleveland and Mizu turned out to be just the thing.  I've been there 3 or 4 times and all the rolls, sushi and sashimi have been great (particularly the spicy yellowtail).  However, their spicy salad is very unique and - IMHO - quite spectacular."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST SUSHI IN CLEVELAND!  ?????????

I signed up for Yelp just so I could leave this review!  I have been eating at Mizu for about 2 years now and have passed the word to many friends.  This place is a diamond in the rough.  I only found it because I was in the area and Siri pointed them out.  Not fancy.  Not always fast.  But if you want GREAT sushi, this is the place to go.  I have had sushi all over the place (west side, downtown, east side, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe and Kyoto) and Mizu equals or surpasses the best of them.

While their standard Maki rolls, Sushi and Sashimi are great, make sure you try some of their special rolls.  The Tiger Shogun Roll (Tempura Lobster) is to die for!  The Butterfly Roll (Tempura Shrimp, Eel, with Mango wrap) is just incredible.  And for fellow Salmon lovers, try the Yellow Stone Roll (Spicy Salmon, Salmon and Mango). If you think Mango sounds weird for sushi (as I once did), you have got to trust me and give it a try.  Incredible!  The special rolls have sauces on them so you don't typically dip them in soy sauce like a regular roll.  And, in case you have never had Tonkatsu (deep fried pork cutlet with a Katsu dipping sauce), you have got to try it!  My Japanese friends made if for us 20 some years ago and it is fantastic.  The appetizer is only like $5 or so.  Yum!!!

Ok, that's it, I am going tonight!

The staff is also great, by the way.  Sushi Chef Peter and his apprentice usually present the regulars with a surprise appetizer -- different each time -- great every time.  Lili, the owner, comes by to chat and makes sure all is well.  Leah and the two or three other servers are always super friendly.  They have my hot saki ready for me before I even ask.

Don't tell too many people about this place.  We should keep it our little secret!"}
{"text":"Great little place for lunch.  Not big, not a chain and somewhat unique.  The prices are reasonable.  The portions are large and the food is fresh.  They won't appear in any best of lists anytime soon but if you are in the area, stop by"}
{"text":"Best sushi, nice staff, awesome prices!  Favorite sushi place in Cleveland!!!  Been going here for years now and have never had a bad experience. Always delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"Very yummy!  Tried it with a groupon and will be back!  Service is wonderful and enjoyed the sushi.  Also tried a Fruitie Roll - which is fruit sushi!  Very fun!"}
{"text":"I think this place is very good for the price. Nothing in Cleveland beats Ginko in Tremont. However Ginko is at least double the cost of Mizu. I think Mizu has very fresh sushi. The service is very attentive. The ambiance is not great, but not horrible. They'd do well to spend a bit of money on decor, etc and they would probably be more successful. Overall very good. Worth going, but only if it's convenient."}
{"text":"Very solid sushi! I had the lunch sashimi and sushi combo for a very reasonable price and a generous amount of fish. The salmon sashimi was as good as I could hope for, and the other fish were pretty fresh. The only thing I could hope for improvement on was the tuna.. I'm not a huge fan of tuna, so even if it's a little subpar it stands out to me a lot. Overall a great lunch option for good quality sushi in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"We are regulars here and it is by far the best sushi in the area. The pink lady roll is our favorite."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant this is easily the best sushi restaurant in Cleveland. All of the dishes look and taste great.  The staff is extremely pleasant and courteous and the owner is always around making sure your meal is fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been in Cleveland for a little over a year now on a project nearby. I used to eat at Mizu once or twice a week when I first started working in the area. Mizu has some decent rolls that hit the spot, but if you're looking for more authentic Japanese sushi, this is not the place to go. The rolls are very \"American-ized\"...drenched in sauce and often with too much rice. Going a little overboard with the sauce is usually a clear indicator that the quality of fish is not that good. I've had cuts of the sashimi at Mizu - not the most fresh, but not the worst either. With that being said, if you're going to consume raw fish, only fresh cuts should be making it to your palette (unless you and your stomach like to live life on the wild side, haha). 

You can ask for less sauce, less rice, more sauce, etc to customize your roll to your liking which is nice - but in my experience, it's been 50/50 whether your sushi roll dreams ever get executed into reality. Often times, it's lost in translation. Either the server didn't understand but gave you a polite nod, or the sushi chef didn't understand the request and just straight up ignored it. 

I ate here often because it was convenient and because it's got enough options on the menu to please an entire party. The price is good - reasonably priced for the average level/quality of sushi served. However, now I hate coming here and only do so when I'm dragged into it. The wait time is ridiculous. Dinner at Mizu now is a full on evening commitment. Block off 3 hours for dinner because it will take that long. The entire staff is unapologetic and unaccommodating to the inconvenience. Also, they stopped accepting American Express. Not sure if they are penny pinching, but it's an inconvenience to those of us who are on business and can't use our corporate card for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Lots of great rolls at a decent price. If you can eat more than two special rolls and not be full I would be surprised. The place is clean and the service is great. I will be returning again very soon."}
{"text":"Excellent Sashimi. Tuna, White Tuna, and Salmon was perfect. Rainbow roll was great too. Prices were very reasonable. Overall great place, my new go to for the CLE airport area!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, great tea, and great service! Our server Emily was very welcoming and attentive! They even put together a cute picture book of their specialty rolls so people know what to expect when they order. I am a returning customer and plan on coming back soon."}
{"text":"i am from California so I tried pretty good sushi before. Yaki Udon was good. Pink lady roll was above average. and we had crazy eel that i would say it's pretty good as well. the green tea mochi was more than below average so i wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my first 5 star review on yelp. Mizu is an amazing sushi spot. 3 dollar rolls on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, dine in or carry out. You can not beat that deal!

Quick serves normally and the owners are super nice! I always bring out of town guest here. I moved from Chicago 7 years ago and this is the best spot I have found that is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find a decent Japanese restaurant in a little strip mall. Since then I have been back a few times!

The sushi (I always order sushi!) is fresh, they have a good variety of options (something for everyone regardless of your taste), and the prices are reasonable. And they have happy hour, too!"}
{"text":"An old high school friend and I reconnected. The last time she was in San Diego, we had sushi, so when I rolled into town for the holidays, it was time to have sushi in Cleveland. She recommended a place that had just opened and I knew of the area. It was in Parma. Parma? Yes, Parma. Parma? I invited my roommate, another common friend of ours from high school that had never had sushi in her life, and friend who is in seminary, who the day before had too much Christmas Ale and puked twice. He's a huggy drunk.

I'll be honest, I had my reservations about the place, especially when I saw their rolls which were small and thin. The only time small and thin is a positive thing is when I'm trying to describe a date. Outside of that, small and thin are never positives when referring to penis sizes or sushi rolls. But with that said, I don't rolls or do bento boxes or care for people flipping my food on a grill (I actually have uncles that do that for a living), but what I do care for is sashimi. I simply eat raw fish and let me say, their sashimi quality and price are almost the best I've seen. The pieces are large and you can get an 18 piece of sashimi for around 20 dollars. That is almost unheard of in California. It is easily a 35 to 40 dollar meal here. The cuts are large and flavor was almost artistic. Salmon is my staple, but to my surprise they even had white tuna. Both types of fish melt in your mouth. If you're sophisticated aficionado of sashimi, this is a gem on the west side of town--Parma? Yes, in Parma."}
{"text":"We ordered through Delivery Me Food. The food was amazing, seriously good. Will be ordering again and stopping in to eat in person."}
{"text":"Sushi is excellent and can't beat half priced rolls on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  My girlfriend and I order at least twice a month and drive all the way from Downtown Cleveland to get it, enough said"}
{"text":"They have the worst customer service I've ever seen. They gave me the wrong order so I called back to tell them.  Then the manager yells at me for having it like it's my fault. I've never been so disrespected in my life. They lost a good customer I would never be back again."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Mizu for takeout - both have left me completely underwhelmed. I've tried a total of 5 rolls and none of them were good enough that I'd want to get them again. When I went in today, there were 2 tables of 2 people in the restaurant eating at the time.  I placed my order and waited 25 minutes. A couple came in and was seated. I waited another 15 minutes. The couple that came in 15 minutes prior had already eaten their soup and their entree was delivered to their table just before my takeout was brought to me. Also, while I was waiting, the gentleman who was making the sushi squatted down and sneezed repeatedly in front of the sushi. Now, I assume he squatted down in the hope that he would sneeze below the sushi he was preparing, but I was completely disgusted nonetheless. I ordered the Sakura, Dynamite and the Stop Light roll. None of the 3 is worth writing home about and I wouldn't order any of them again.  In fact, based on the length of time I had to wait for my 3 rolls, I would not try Mizu again. I'm terribly disappointed because I really wanted to like this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Sushi.  New Resident to the Cleveland.  As I am a fan of Sushi, I went to every restaurant in the Cleveland area.  Mizu is by far the best when it comes to quality, cost, and variety.

I highly recommend to all."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a groupon to use, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and the food.

Everything we tried was interesting, fresh tasting, and well presented.
Mexican Roll with paper-thin slices of jalapenos on top was GREAT! 
Another sushi with mango on top was really interesting - sweet yet tangy.

We can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding. I can't think of anything negative to say about Mizu. I have been there probably two dozen times and never had a bad experience. I've always had great service and food. Leah is an outstanding waitress and a personal favorite. The menu is extensive and the variety is amazing.

The sushi  is unbelievably fresh and high quality. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are great days to visit with \"all day happy hour\" which means half priced sushi rolls. You can even order them as take out for that special. The price points are competitive in general and I have purchased several of their restaurant.com gift cards. 

When I'm not having a regular maki roll, one of my favorite sushi bar signature rolls is the \"Crouching Tiger\"! How do you say delectable? \"Five kinds of sashimi, tuna, salmon, white fish, yellow tail and eel blanked over a spicy tuna, avocado and tempura flakes roll. Tempura flake with eel sauce, spicy mayo, green onion and masago on top!\" Giddee up!"}
{"text":"This was surprisingly amazing for such an arbitrary location. The out of control roll changed my life. Service=perfection. I had moderate hopes and I was blown away. This is basically Ginko quality at half the price. I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, we have been looking for a small non chain feeling sushi place for a long time and this is the place. Very personal and a lot of great combos of sushi."}
{"text":"worst japanese i ever had. they will not survive in japan, ny nor los angeles. not even a few days.
have no clue what sushi and japanese is supposed to taste.

kintaro is way better than them. 
i would never pay to eat crap like this."}
{"text":"Must go for lunch. It was packed for lunch, and deservedly so. It was so cheap and so good. Entrees come with garden salad and miso soup. Service was awesome and very quick to refill your waters or get you more wasabi. 5 stars for great sushi and great service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I drive past it all the time but thought it was one those bad places to go since it didn't look busy. I didn't think the food was going to be fresh but lord have mercy was it AWESOME!! I ended up get the boat just so I can sample everything and it blew my mind. Everything was so fresh and clean. This is my go to place for sushi!"}
{"text":"easily the best sushi in town - very fresh - the only place in Cleveland where I'll order sashimi. great service & price point as well."}
{"text":"Sushi was excellent! I was actually quite surprised considering this is in a very small shopping center/store front and perhaps not a place you would even consider trying. The chicken fried rice was the best I have ever had. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"We have been searching for a really solid sushi place in the Cleveland area. Primarily West side. We had some amazing sushi on the East Coast, and I think it spoiled us for everything local. After going to many \"not bad\" places, we found Mizu for my birthday last weekend. I need to say WOW!! The Sashimi was fresh, with the right texture and flavor. The rolls were just the right size, and the flavor was great! 
Then there is the service, such a great little spot. Our waitress was attentive and friendly, and the sushi chefs were friendly as well. I HIGHLY recommend this spot to anyone looking for truly good sushi!!!"}
{"text":"Carry out orders can be difficult and service a bit slow but the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for very good sushi and a laid back atmosphere, look no further. We've stopped in with friends for a meal and ordered online to pick up on the way home from work. Fresh, fun unique signature maki or standard fare..... Yet never standard. 

Slight language barrier but very friendly staff who work hard to bring great food."}
{"text":"This is the closest sushi place to my house and since I crave sushi constantly, I've been frequenting it quite a bit lately. It's small, the servers are all really friendly, the sushi is good. 

It's not the best sushi place in Cleveland but it's a fantastic place to go when you want some creative rolls. I've tried quite a few of the larger rolls and every time that I think that I've found a favorite, I try something new and it becomes my new favorite. 

They have great specials too."}
{"text":"I've been on a quest for good sushi near Lakewood for so long (this is the one thing Lakewood is lacking!). Mizu is one of the nearest places and so far, the best place I've tried. Good prices and yummy sushi! It always tastes fresh and I love the variety. This is my go-to place on this side of town when I'm in the mood for some rolls!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is probably the best hidden place to get sushi from in the Parma/Cleveland/Brooklyn area.  Sure there are a few hibachi places, but this restaurant focuses on sushi and they are really good at it.  My husband and I have gone for date night, I've gone with friends and I have taken our family here as well.  All of the kids even enjoyed it (our youngest doesn't like sushi so he had the fried rice and it was delicious as well).  We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi fan, so this review is not about that.

I came in for lunch and was seated immediately by a friendly waitress. I ordered the lunch special, the Bento box with chicken and veggie tempura. The salad that came first was yummy, chilled, with the best carrot dressing. The miso soup was also good. The box came filled with tempura, california rolls, shrimp dumpling, and rice, and all were SO GOOD! For $8 a total deal. The waitress was ever attentive without being overbearing. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Friendly service!  Unassuming location but don't let that fool you. We needed Japanese food not too far from the freeway and were very satisfied at the end of our meal."}
{"text":"Great place to grab good sushi at good prices. Staff is very friendly. Place is small and cozy. They have specials running on Tuesday and Wednesday so plan on waiting for a table on those days. Recommend."}
{"text":"Decided to give Mizu a shot after seeing such great reviews. The place is in Parma in a small strip mall. It definitely appeared to be a possible hidden gem, but I was sadly disappointed. 
My friend ordered an iced tea to drink. It tasted old and slightly off - so we were off to a bad start. We ordered two house salads. The iceberg lettuce was wet and yellowish. The ginger dressing was watery - it was like watered down lettuce soup. 
We tried a little of everything. For sushi we ordered the sweet potato tempura roll, unagi, yellowtail and the spider roll. The sweet potato roll was fine, you can't mess that up. But the fish - it was just off. It was clearly not fresh. The soft shell crab in the spider roll was straight up fishy. So fishy, that my friend spit it out. 
Third course was vegetable udon noodles. It was flavorless and mushy with raw chunks of broccoli and canned baby corn. 
Our server was very friendly and did a good job, but the food was just bad."}
{"text":"Tired of driving, we consulted Yelp as we drive from Philadelphia to Chicago. There, in an unassuming strip mall, was a little piece of paradise called Mizu Sushi. 

All three of us had a great meal, from tempura to the half-price rolls featured on Tuesdays. The place was packed with happy diners. The service was excellent, and our meals were good. Mizu did not dissapoint, and I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've found in Cleveland by far.  It's very unassuming from the outside but take my word you won't be disappointed. It's become the only place we go for sushi. Haven't tried anything yet that I haven't thoroughly loved, so get a wide variety and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have heard so many good things but was really cautious as it is located in a tiny and dingy looking strip mall.

I had a roll and some sushi. If I stuck to the rolls I think my rating would be better. The roll was great, but the sushi was OK.

If I come back, I'll stick to the rolls."}
{"text":"Everything is perfect and cheap. Go there on Wednesday they have $3 rolls! You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"This place was dead on a Tuesday night so service was great.  Had white tuna, eel, tuna and salmon.  Salmon could have been better but everything else washed that gripe away.  Have the Halloween roll, it's knock your sock off.   If you like a good Zin, they have that too.  I'll be back next time in town."}
{"text":"100% best sushi restaurant in Cleveland,the sushi is very juicy and fried wuton is delicious"}
{"text":"This is the best place for sushi near Cleveland. And I say this after living in Japan and having experienced truly amazing sushi. The service is also great, and the decor neat and clean. I'd give it 4.5 stars for those reasons, because you don't expect that level of niceness with Chinese-owned sushi places.

Food-wise, they have the usual selection of maki rolls, nigiri, and special rolls. I use saba (mackerel) and salmon nigiri to guage sushi places, as it is quite difficult to make saba nigiri really well, and quite difficult to mess up salmon. The saba here is fresh and good, definitely not the greatest but solid at 4 star quality. The salmon is fine, but it usually is. The other maki and special rolls that I've tried taste good and all use fresh fish.

The awesome thing about this place, which makes up for otherwise pricey sushi, is the $3 per regular roll happy hour, which happens all day on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and every afternoon from 4:30 to 6pm. Although the roll sizes aren't large, at $3 each you can get a filling meal at a decent price on fresh sushi, which is rare around  here. The happy hour is an even better deal than what you can get with a Groupon.

Can't comment on the wine selection as I don't drink.

Overall, good tasty sushi, no frills added. Not the best that I've had, but definitely the best in Northern Ohio that I know of, and with good service in a nice clean setting to boot."}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the exterior and location.  The sushi options at this little place were quite good and the fish was surprisingly fresh.  My husband and i ordered 3 rolls and 1 order or nigiri sushi.  While this is still Ohio and doesn't compare to some places I have been in California, I would definitely recommend it and will be back again.  The only negative for me was many of the rolls have too much sauce for my taste."}
{"text":"The rolls were fresh and delicious, and the service was very good. I thought the prices were reasonable. Our group ordered the Green Ninja roll, a spider roll, a tamago roll, and a tempura sweet potato roll. That sweet potato roll was the tastiest thing I've had in a long time! We also got edamame, Udon, miso soup, and a few orders of gyoza. 

It's such an unassuming little spot. We really enjoyed our meal there."}
{"text":"The sushi is fantastic!!  They were very busy on the night we visited and we had to wait a while to get our order - but it was worth the wait!  All of our dishes were elegant  fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"The sushi was very good, and really decently priced. My lady friend and I had the one called a mexican roll and unless youre a fan of very spicy I dont recommend it. I am so I found the thin slice of raw jalapeno a treat. The only reason Im giving it 4 stars and not 5 is solely based on the fact they definitely needed another server. Her and I sat for almost 5 minutes before our drink orders were taken. Minus that Ill definitely be back again whenever I get a sushi craving."}
{"text":"Best sushi around. I've been going here for years and everything is always fresh and tasty. Staff is very pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"All good sushi restaurants are in Parma!

My first visit was fantastic and I have added it to my top sushi picks in NEO. The size of the sushi rolls for the price that Mizu charges is amazing! This is the first place I have been in a long time that I actually enjoyed eel in my sushi. One of my favorite things is that they give you a menu of sushi filled with pictures so you know exactly what the roll will look like when they set it in front of you. It's the simplest things that go a long way in my opinion!

My boyfriend and I ordered the Christmas Roll, Shrimp Roll, Crazy Tuna Roll and the Rock and Roll. They were all equally delicious. I can't wait to visit again and try the Green Tea ice cream that other yelpers have posted about!"}
{"text":"We waited for quite a long time but I'd say it was well worth it. The people here are very nice and recommends great food. We ordered sushi cake and crazy eel."}
{"text":"I've been quite a bit of a sushi-guru for many years.  I've eaten sushi in multiple cities, states, and countries -- I can't possibly even tell you about all of them.  Point is, I have mad sushi-cred, and therefore, fellow reader, you should consider my review seriously when I say:

Mizu Sushi, in Parma Ohio, United States -- Is the best sushi I have ever had.

The place is fairly small, and unimpressive when you merely LOOK at it -- sure, it doesn't have a mini-bridge and pond inside like Shinto, no fancy state of the art hibachi grills, nor expensive-looking modern deco... But it has, without a doubt, THE BEST SUSHI EVER.  Hands down.  The end.  Your quest for delicious sushi is OVER.  Now, go give them your business-- they deserve it more than anyone else.  However, be warned: it's not a cheap place to eat--however, that will not detract from THIS 5 star review.

Also, the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of co-workers for a Japanese lunch (one of them has never been).  I was in the mood for a bento box and the other guys wanted sushi rolls.  I ordered the shrimp tempura bento box and the guys each picked three different styles of sushi to eat and share.

The meal started with the typical soup and salad course.  Although I've had these items at many other restaurants, I really enjoyed their version of a salad dressing that was much thicker (and tangier) than other places.  The soup was warm and comforting on this rainy day.

The tempura shrimp bento box came with a few other tempura battered veggies, a couple of dumplings, rice and four pieces of a California roll.  It was great to have such a variety of items to eat, dip, mix.  The guys sushi plates looked lovely and they gobbled them up in no time.

Efficient service, made-to-order sushi and a large menu of additional choices / options made for a great lunch outing."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Mizu. I have called ahead and ordered sushi for carry out during dinner service several times and it's been ready in 20 minutes, which is how long it takes me to drive there. You get great service eating in the restaurant too. With the exception of Ginko in Tremont (which is $$$), this is some of the best sushi I've had. I'd say it's definitely worth a try if you're new to sushi or have lots of experience eating it."}
{"text":"This is hands down, the best sushi I have ever had. Rolls are beautiful and intricate. The Hawaii roll is the best thing I've ever had. Service is good, fast and efficient. They really know what they are doing!!"}
{"text":"You would never this place in a dilapidated srip on Brookpark would serve some of the best sushi around.  Not exactly fine dining, or a traditional Japanese experience, but the sushi is wonderful.  They have everything you could expect a sushi restaurant, and some concoctions they invented.  The menu comes with a photo album to help decide."}
{"text":"I've had Mizu Sushi takeout multiple times, and the food has always been amazing. We dined in for my boyfriend's birthday, and not only was the food great, the service was wonderful as well! The server went out of her way and was extremely patient dealing with a large group on a busy Friday night. I can't recommend Mizu enough!"}
{"text":"I was happy with the food and service.  Its not the greatest sushi, but for the price its great.  I loved the shrimp tempera rolls.  The spicy tuna was okay, same with the eel and california rolls.  My guest didn't like their miso soup, I tried it and I've had better and worse.  The waitress was good, always refilling the water."}
{"text":"I drove 20 minutes while in town after reading about the sushi cake on the menu. I went with hopes that it would be a layered sushi dish like a tuna tower...greatly dissappointed! 
The menu is misleading...what it should say is -a sushi roll smooshed together with salmon, sauce, and a cherry on top because sadly that is what it was.(you can see in the pic I posted) The sushi was just ok, nothing special . The miso soup, tasted awful and smelled horrible. 
Sorry, can't really give a great review for this place. I'm not sure how it gets 5 stars from everyone..."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had, which isn't saying much since I am not a sushi connoisseur and I'm also not very adventurous (I stick with spicy shrimp, shrimp tempura, california, sweet potato), but I am never disappointed and I always leave happy.

Really friendly staff, and on Tuesdays and Wednesdays they have discounted regular rolls. YUM!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on the way out of Cleveland to get our sushi fix.  The good reviews here were not wrong.  We enjoyed some fresh sushi rolls and found a few worth mentioning - the dynamite roll, Parma roll and sushi cake.  All were excellent and worth another taste next time."}
{"text":"People were nice and actually too friendly. Our waiter checked on us literally every five minutes that it made it hard for my husband and I to hold a conversation during dinner.  Sushi was unfulfilling. We ordered a special roll, but one of the hostess actually told us that the salmon skin in it made the roll unappetizing .....so why is it on the menu? My husband ordered an unagi, and he said he never had one so thin on the eel.  

I'm terrible but I didn't have the heart to tell the owners the truth when she asked me if I thought the sushi was delicious. How was I suppose to say it wasn't when she put me on the spot. I will say that the yellowtail was tasty, but being a sushi lover the fish they had lost flavor. Tasted like the fish was shipped and stored frozen until ready for use."}
{"text":"I bought the groupon for this place and had decent expectations after reading some of the reviews here. I was actually even more impressed with my actual experience.  The food is very fresh. We got a few of their specialty rolls and then also got a few of the regular rolls and everything was very tasty. The service is what impressed me the most. The restaurant space was small but we were constantly well taken care of. 

Things of note: They have a happy hour from 4:30-6pm everyday that the regular rolls are only $3.  Also, as said in another review, this place is in a strip mall. From the outside it dose not look anywhere as nice as the meal I got there."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this place by my buddy. Off the charts. Who knew a SUSHI place in PARMA.  Great food great service. You gotta try it."}
{"text":"Great Sushi! Have to try the Parma roll and the Christmas roll! Their salmon sashimi is really good  too. Clean dining area and great service. 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi with a small dining room. We had the Christmas roll, pink lady, 2 in 1, and aso maki specialty rolls. I didn't like the pink lady based on personal preference but the other three were great. They have a small selection of inexpensive beer, wine, and saki. Service was excellent and informative. Would highly recommend Mizu!"}
{"text":"Mizu has been around for awhile and I'm quite a regular.  They're sushi rolls are tasty, and their staff is very nice and accommodating.  Their shrimp Udon is one of my favorites along with their Out of Control Roll.  I would say you can't go wrong with their rolls or dishes and you'll enjoy every bite.  The only reason this isn't a 5 star is due to their sashimi (raw fish).  Although they do have sashimi, I find their cuts a bit small and not worth the price that they charge.  The selection of sashimi is also limited but like I've said; They're a great sushi place and I will always see myself coming back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in all of Cleveland! Great prices, with a friendly staff. They always remember me when I return and are very talkative. The Hawaiian roll is to die for! They run specials on the basic rolls every Tuesday and Wednesday. Your food comes out prompt and fresh every time!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi restaurant right on the border of Parma. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The prices are great and the quality of food you get makes some other sushi bars look very incompetent. You can tell that the fish is fresh, nice and cold and no bad tastes or weird textures (don't ask, I've questioned my sushi before at other places....). Some other restaurants use too much rice and not enough fish but I feel that Mizu has the perfect combination of both."}
{"text":"Since when did Parma become asian town? Between Mely's Kianan, Kumo, Nipa Hut, that highly rated korean restaurant  on Pearl and this place, there is plenty of food to make my wife happy. I grew up in Parma and all that was there when I was young were old people and kids with no interest in much of anything, especially other cultures. In the words of Walter Sobchak, a land of nihilists.

Anyway, the sushi and service were good. Probably not 4 stars, but at least 3.5. My wife lived in Japan for four years and that's were I met her, so we know sushi... her more than I.

Nice joint in an otherwise boring location."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place. The menu has many options to cover whatever preference you have with sushi. The rolls are all great and the place is very comfortable and casual. The staff is all very friendly and helpful as well. Favorite sushi in Cleveland."}
{"text":"the staff here are mostly Mandarin speaking Chinese. the sushi is average for a non Japanese restaurant, but the price is great during happy hour. the staff is friendly and helpful, but as always try one order of sushi and make sure it has flavor, as after slow days it may be preserved with baking soda... not experienced this at this restaurant yet, but many do this."}
{"text":"I gave it a four star coz the food was good but not too perfect coz it was a bit pricey. $4-5 for 2pcs sashimi."}
{"text":"The food was spectacular and the service was even better! I recommend this place if you are craving sushi. The atmosphere is nice. The miso soup is very good and the crab rangoon was the best I have ever had. They provide a book of menu items along with their pictures to help make the selection easier. If I lived closer, I would certainly be a regular!"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to post my glowing review of Misu. Because I don't ever want to go there and not be able to get in! Their excellent food, fantastic service, and all around magnificence demand praise. Our family has been frequenting Mizu since they opened, and have never had an unsatisfactory experience.  They excel in sushi rolls. There is always a special roll or two of the day, and the menu is quite full of delicious items. The Pink Lady is by far, their best! In fact, when we walk in the door, they immediately start making one for us! The owner is a hard working, gracious, friendly woman. Raymond the waiter always makes us laugh, and we have so much fun doing saki bombs when he is our waiter! Give it a try- you won't be sorry!! 
** when my husband & I read online reviews we always throw the best and worst review out, and put stock in the middle ones. Please, do not discount my review- I am not the owner, an investor, or in any way connected to Mizu, aside from being a loyal, happy customer!!!!"}
{"text":"Mizu sushi never lets me down! The waiters and waitresses are so pleasant . The hot roll is a must along with the green hat ! Phenomenal ! The take out is quick and the sit down is a comfortable atmosphere . They have great deals too ! All in all I haven't found a better sushi restaurant in town."}
{"text":"The ever-increasing popularity of sushi has now given way to a marked increase in availability and, unfortunately, a range in quality.  The Japanese delicacy can now be found in cafeterias, food courts and strip malls, in addition to hibachi steakhouses and other Asian restaurants.  Mizu does fall into the \"strip mall\" category, and to be sure, it is a small establishment.  However...the sushi here is absolutely wonderful.  Exquisite presentation, coupled with pleasant, knowledgeable servers made for a relaxing, delicious dining experience.  A respectable selection of futomaki is offered, along with maki rolls and generous portions of sashimi. We enjoyed the edamame (steamed, salted soybeans) as an appetizer and the \"480\" roll, along with a few maki rolls.  Many hot entrees are also available, including teriyaki, tempura, udon and soba noodles, and so much more...full liquor and take out available too.  If you are staying at a nearby hotel on Tiedeman, skip the chain restaurants and check out some fabulous cuisine at this local gem."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am no expert on sushi, but this place is great. I work right up the road, and when my coworkers told me they wanted to take me to a sushi restaurant sandwiched between a Subway and a questionable convenience store in a Parma strip mall I was understandably skeptical. I couldn't help but have flashbacks to the gastrointestinal discomfort I felt after an all-you-can-eat sushi experiment during my high school years in rural PA... But I was pleasantly surprised by Mizu. They serve some of the best sushi I've had in Cleveland, and although my sample size is small I can certainly say that the majority of people would be pleased with the quality here. They have a pretty nifty $3 roll deal certain days of the week that I have partaken in a number of times. The deal only applies to their more simple rolls, but it's worth the savings. They also have a nice lunch deal where you get the soup, salad, and three rolls for something like $15. I used to hit this deal two or three times a week before I realized I was poor and I should go back to eating ham slices without bread for lunch every day so I can keep paying my rent. 

As far as complaints, I really don't have any. It's kind of small and sometimes the service is slow, but I'm usually not mad that they keep me from going back to work for an extra ten minutes. Their bathrooms could probably use a thorough cleaning, and they do have a creepy waving cat statue on the bar, but otherwise it is a wonderful establishment. 

Final verdict: I love it. I know right now you're asking: \"Gene, haven't you eaten sushi at Get-Go before?\" and the answer is yes. That was my Thanksgiving dinner one year. But I can confidently say this place is 1000x better than Get-Go. I would eat lunch here every day if I wasn't poor. If they ditch that waving cat statue and I might eat here every day anyway, screw the rent."}
{"text":"Was not over all impressed, just ok for the price comparable to wild ginger but more $$. Will stick with sushi 86."}
{"text":"So awesome!!! Both times I've come here, I have loved my sushi!!! I had the sushi cake with crab, spices tuna, salmon and avocado topped with tempura flakes, spices mayo, scallions, and eel sauce. So delicious and fresh!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't describe it as \"outstanding\" or a \"hidden gem\", but it is fine. $3 rolls on Tuesday and Wednesday are a good value. The inside decor is cozy and the service was prompt. You could do a lot worse, but not sure I'd drive across town just to go there."}
{"text":"First time here, food was really good, good service and not expensive. They have some really good special. I gotta say its worth the drive from Lakewood."}
{"text":"I've been really wanting to explore the places for sushi. Also I know people can get sick from sushi but I took a shot and this is a gem! The service is fast. They have a wide variety of rolls and nigiri. They also have other entrees if you're not into sushi. I ordered the California roll, salmon roll and spicy crab roll. All of them were very good! The spicy crab roll wasn't very spicy which was perfect for me. Their wasabi that they served wasn't as strong as I was expecting it to be. I put quite a bit of it in my soy sauce. It's not necessarily a bad thing just different. Overall the place is a great place to start if you want to get into sushi. They even have picture menus!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for sushi because the reviews were good. I'm a huge sushi lover and I've eaten sushi damn near everywhere. This is a great place in Cleveland! It's quiet, small, off the beaten path, and extremely reasonably priced! Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Mizo is just the best. It's totally a hidden jem that we've overlooked for so many sad years until a friend suggested it to us. 

They've got specials all throughout the week (check online for days and times) and be aware that they close for about an hour in the day (again, check for times). 

The vegetable and miso soups are wonderful. The mango and crouching tiger roll are awesome as well as all of their other rolls (salmon and tuna and eel, oh my!) Stuck to the sushi because it's done so well I never want to stray. Throw some sake and green tea ice cream in there and float right off to happy land. 

Service is always great, and I think they've got coupons online."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday party. Overall, it was a decent Midwestern style Japanese restaurant (though it is Chinese run). We had a snafu with seating for our large group, resulting in some confusion and disorganization among the servers.

We ordered several special rolls to split amongst a small group. There's a lot of mayo, tempura, sweet elements (like mango) and cheese included in many of the rolls. Also, lots and lots of sauce. Out of the 4 rolls, I think my favorite was the Amazing Roll.."}
{"text":"Normal small japanese restaurant. Went here since it was close Freeway Lanes and we wanted to go bowling afterwards.

The waitress was friendly upon arrival and asked if we were Chinese. She then proceeded to speak to us in Chinese. 

We ordered the Love Boat for 2, which is a nice spread of 16 pieces of sashimi, 10 pieces nigiri and a maki roll and special roll from their menu.
This was all nice except for the fact that the sushi chef made the selections for you and you couldn't really change it yourself.

The fish tasted very fresh and nicely arranged so all it all, it was more than I would've hoped for a sushi restaurant in a strip mall.

Like I said before, nothing especially amazing about anything but if I were in the area and craving Japanese, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Truly amazing delivery service to Avon Lake and the food was out of this world! Seriously among the best if not the best sushi I've ever had. I am definitely going to become a regular here!"}
{"text":"For take out or dine in, this little place has big things going. Awesome sushi and our servers are always more than nice and make sure you have everything you need."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sushi place in the area, actually anywhere. The sushi is always so good and fresh and can not beat the $3 roll specials. One of their best specialty rolls is the Pink Lady. One is one then enough since is so large.  

Besides the sushi, the ladies who work there are very sweet and remember you when you come in. On many days our sushi would be ready for us if we called in and wanted to eat there."}
{"text":"This place has never steered me wrong. I was recommended to mizu sushi several years ago and loved it ever since. This was my first time there in about 2 years, and it was just as good as I remembered. They have a very big menu with lots of different sushi rolls to choose from. I was sort of disappointed in the spring rolls, however. They weren't expensive (I think $4.50) and were very tasty, but there was literally about 3 bites of food. So just be aware of that if you decide to go with them. Other than that, I was completely satisfied with everything about this cozy little sushi spot. If you're a sushi lover and haven't been here, you have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!  The sushi was outstanding and fresh!!  Also had Spicy Crab Rangoon and they had huge chunks of crab in them.  We shared the Udon Noodle and those too had wonderful flavor.
But by far my favorite was the Hot Roll!!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I want sushi this is where I go! Great prices and the food is consistently delicious. The restaurant is always immaculate and the service is great. Crazy #1 is my family's favorite. If you are in the area you must try this place. Its in a small shopping center and doesn't look like much from the outside but it's always worth the stop!"}
{"text":"The only reason the review is not 5 stars is because  we had a reservation for a party of 12 and it was not ready at the time and when we sat about 15 minutes after the time it was for we had to split up the entire party between the tables and sushi bar.

So the experience did not start off great. However once we sat down. Everything was fantastic. They were extremely busy. I thought the service was good. Now the sushi. WOW. It was honestly worth it for the snafu we encountered. Got the crazy tuna roll. Succulent! The tempura was perfect. Tried the shrimp teriyaki and chicken noodle dish. All of the food was very much worth it. 

I would suggest coming in as a smaller type party. 
I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is such a jewel. Located in a strip mall in the Parma area, you would never expect to find great sushi around. 

My friends, the sushi was great... Certainly comparable to what you get in downtown Cleveland.  The Christmas roll was my personal favorite. I honestly don't remember what was in it but it was spectacular. 

I will say that it is certainly Americanized sushi, but let's face it- the stuff is delicious.  (No complaints from this girl.) 

Finally, the wait staff was pleasant and attentive!"}
{"text":"Mizu sushi is my favorite secret spot for incredible sushi in northeast Ohio. First time I visited, I didn't expect much based on the small plaza and storefront/location..but damn was I impressed. I come here almost on a weekly basis for their tue/wed $3 maki rolls, favorites include the sweet potato tempura roll and salmon avocado roll. I recently tried one of their specialty rolls and didn't understand why I hadn't done so sooner. Very blessed to live less than 30 min from such a hidden gem! Bonus tip-you can even get the $3 maki rolls to go for pickup (they tend to be crowded tue/wed nt)!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the greater Cleveland area, hands down.  I've never had anything I didn't like there, and I make it a point to try something new every time I go.  If you like very spicy foods, get the Fire Island roll - you'll never forget it."}
{"text":"Consistently fresh and delicious. A wonderful find in an unassuming little strip mall."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick stop while picking up someone from the airport.
Very good miso, very good sushi. Would happily come back again."}
{"text":"I had the harumaki and the sushi dinner plate, everything was great! The fish was delicious and the service was good."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi fanatic, and have been itching to share my love with my stubborn parents for a while now. While home for a weekend from college, I hopped online to look for a good restaurant to take them to for their first sushi experience. I quickly found out that our area is fairly limited - I really only found a few pricey, popular sushi restaurants. My favorite sushi place at school is a quiet and cozy hidden treasure, and I really hoped to find one back home. I came across Mizu, read a couple raving reviews, and showed the website to my parents. After the initial freakout (\"ewww! I will NOT eat raw fish!\"), my parents immediately attacked the location. It is nestled in on the corner of Brookpark and Tiedeman, which is a far cry from the optimum setting of a place with such a sensitive menu.

Somehow, I got them in the car and dragged them down to the restaurant. The first comment out of my dad was \"Oh, a completely vacant parking lot on a Friday night. This oughta be great.\" My stomach dropped when we entered the completely empty dining room, but I was pleased by the decor - understated and classic oriental looking. I immediately ordered the edamame to fill my parents mouths before they could start complaining. Any fan of Japanese food I would expect knows how awesome edamame is, and it was the first step Mizu took in winning my parents (and myself!) over. After much deliberation, my father and I decided on a specialty rolls while my mother elected for sweet potato tempura and shrimp/cucumber rolls, still against the raw fish aspect.

I was immediately impressed by my Iron Man roll - it was FANTASTIC! I definitely recommend it for salmon lovers. My mother was content with her rolls but favored the sweet potato. I was completely shocked by my father's reaction - he was SO in love with his Green Hat roll, he savored it and literally cleaned his plate and ate all the garnishments, then ordered a philly roll (which he also enjoyed) to top it off! All of the rolls were presented beautifully. The staff was great - very attentive and patient with my indecisive and uncultured family (we even received complimentary watermelon). We were only set back $44 - what a deal for 5 orders of sushi, plus 1 drink!

My parents are now absolutely in love with this place and plan to make regular visits. I've been to my fair share of sushi restaurants and count this among the best in variety and quality of rolls, as well as value. The location really is a shame - it's set in a strip on a busy road in a not so good neighborhood - I think it could really thrive somewhere like North Royalton, where it seems to me there is a bigger sushi following. The word really needs to get out about this place - I'd hate to see such a great restaurant go down due to lack of business. Please, give Mizu a try!"}
{"text":"As 3 hungry college students on the prowl in the Cleveland area, we were searching for a nice place for dinner that wasn't one of the endless bars and American food places in the area. We decided to take a chance and go here, and boy did we make a good decision. It's a relatively small place, with seating for around 20-30 people and a relaxed, homey atmosphere. The staff was very attentive, quick and accommodating, willing to answer all our questions.

I ordered a pretty standard set of sushi (6 rolls each of spicy tuna, yellowtail and eel cucumber) with 2 miso soups and 2 side salads for only $16. Pretty good deal, if you ask me. The soup was hot, and the salad was fresh and clearly was just made. My friends got the chicken and shrimp teriyaki, as well as the vegetable udon soup. I like to think there's two kinds of chicken: average, bland-ish portions that just kinda feel like \"bleh\" in your mouth, and then there's the kind that is vibrant, hot and clearly made just for you. This one in my friend's order was the second kind.

Their portions were pretty big, but not unreasonably so. If they could contently fill three college students on a budget, that's something worthy of a good Yelp review. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good meal or sushi/Japanese food in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"My go to sushi bar, awesome sushi and Japanese food. Priced right and best of all open late."}
{"text":"I have been to Mizu many times and have always enjoyed the experience. The staff is very friendly and remembered me after my second visit. The sushi is top notch without a top notch price. The sushi chef always comps me a little something (as is usual when a good sushi chef gets to know you). They have a diverse menu and a picture book of the different sushi. Additionally, they offer special sushi preperations on an almost nightly basis. Combine that with the sushi \"happy hour\" pricing and the other menu items and you have a great little hidden gem of a restaurant. If you like sushi and don't want to pay a fortune for it, give Mizu a try!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find. Yelp did not steer me wrong on this one. This is a great little spot. The staff is extremely friendly and the sushi was very good."}
{"text":"Wow! I was VERY pleasantly surprised finding this place. I won't lie, it is a hole in the wall, about 12 tables and a small sushi bar... but the sushi is AMAZING. Also helps my server was extremely polite, knowledgeable, and attentive.

Everyone has to start somewhere, I wouldn't be surprised if they move into a much larger location in the future."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!! Great prices too. The servers are always friendly. Celebrated my birthday here and got to pick a free desert. I didn't have to get the obligatory piece of cake either. Definitely one of the best sushi places in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I love coming here on my lunch break. The food is always fresh no matter dine in or take out. The staff is pleasant and gracious. Ask for Emily she is really nice and friendly. Overall, I appreciate the decor, staff, food freshness."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi that I've found in the Cleveland area so far.

It's located in a dingy little strip joint but once you get inside the food is fantastic.

We absolutely love the \"Fire Island\" roll, an extra spicy roll stuffed with jalapenos and other goodies.

We also love the service.  If you sit up at the sushi bar on a busy night, the chefs will often serve up some complimentary snacks to help ease the wait."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi restaurant in Cleveland! The quality of the fish and dishes is high, and the prices are low and reasonable. Plus, half-price rolls on Tuesdays and Wednesdays make it even better! The special house rolls here are better than those of higher-priced restaurants, and the staff is friendly and service quick. Definitely a place to try for both sushi lovers and novices alike.

We had miso soup + salad, spicy yellowtail, tuna avocado, and Philadelphia maki rolls, and the Snow White Maki special roll."}
{"text":"Being one of the few places to offer sushi around Parma/Brooklyn has it's perks. I was here on a Monday night and the restaurant got fairly packed towards the end of our dinner. Seeing that it has an average of four stars, I thought I'd give this place a try (and I had a two-year old restaurant.com certificate). The place is a bit small, fitting maybe 50 guests + a few at the bar. There's not too much Asian inspired decor, which isn't a bad thing. 

Anyhow, my girlfriend and I ordered miso soup and soft shell crab to start. The crab arrived pretty quickly and was hot. It was somewhat crunchy but the meat lacked texture and was a mushy. The waitress forgot about our soups until I reminded her. For the main course, we ordered scallop sushi, salmon and tuna sashimi, spider roll, and dynamite roll.
 The scallop sushi was fresh and sweet. The salmon sashimi was definitely the better of the two. The salmon was buttery and smooth, the tuna on the other hand was a bit too chilled and not as buttery. The sushi rolls were nicely presented and wrapped tightly. The soft shell crab in the spider roll was definitely better than the one we had for appetizer. It was crunchier and the meat was denser. I also like the crunch the roman lettuce added to the spider roll. The dynamite roll was topped with thinly sliced mangos with a mayo/mango sauce. In the roll, there was imitation crab, tuna, and avocados. It was different, a bit sweet, and tangy, I liked it. We finished the night with red bean ice cream. The ice cream was delicious, very creamy with just the right amount of sweetness. I need to find this ice cream at the Asian markets!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. Staff was friendly. We went on a Friday night and our food came out do fast we couldn't believe it. There are tons of great rolls to choose from. We will surely be coming back !"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I was skeptical, but they have fair prices and can back it up. Their sushi is so great and their staff is so friendly. I am so glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Our seemingly endless search for amazing sushi has come to a (temporary) end at Mizu -- a wonderful little Japanese restaurant tucked away in a thoroughly unbecoming little corner of Parma. Every roll we had was top-notch, and the prices are quite fair. Our non-sushi-eating son ordered Shrimp Tempura and loved every bite. We will definitely be back.

Only con: service a bit slow/inattentive at times."}
{"text":"I was here with friends for the first time at least for me, like the setting. Service was spot on, nice beer list. Happened to be here on Wednesday for half price rolls. Got 4 different rolls. For the amount of rolls you get the price is fairly easy to handle. When you order a set of rolls you get 6 rolls per choice. I ate every bit of mine 24 rolls. We had also split something called snow ball roll, it was a large roll, but very good. Definently will return."}
{"text":"Now I get it... why this place has great reviews and why it's been picked as one of the top sushi places of Cleveland. 
Also, I TOTALLY understand why one of their top sellers is called the crouching tiger... it's like this- imagine Bruce Lee. Now imagine him made out of all kinds of deliciousness. Now all this deliciousness just kicked your teeth in with a swift roundhouse of flavor and awesomeness. That's the crouching tiger... get the crouching tiger. And a good dentist."}
{"text":"Have I had better sushi, of course. This place is good though. The prices are great and the options are plenty. It's a small restaurant too but strangely enough it didn't get too loud to enjoy your own conversation. I have to say though, the spicy tuna pizza is the bomb.com. I would go back for that alone"}
{"text":"The owner is very nice and always remembers  a face! Best sushi on the west side! Great service too. 

They also have great lunch deals during the week."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here. We were greeted by the nicest waitress. So polite and pleasant. The food was great. We got the Crouching Tiger roll and the Tokyo roll and they were both delicious. I have to say though, the service was just outstanding and made this place really stand out. \"Thank You\" \"I appreciate it/that\" almost with every interaction. To top it all off, when our waitress cleared our table (clearing my empty beer glass), she came out with water without me even asking. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We took our family here for my sons birthday and had exceptionally great service.  The food was good and they allowed us to bring a cake in to celebrate !"}
{"text":"Really good. Also, the server was so energetic and nice!  But, this took me aback- we each (only 2 ppl) got a dinner entree each (you know, comes with soup and salad) and then split the special sushi on the board.  Ok.  When my partner got the check at the end of the meal, the SPECIAL SUSHI THAT WE SHARED WAS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OUR MEALS. I was flabbergasted.  Thank god he brought enough dough!"}
{"text":"One day like 3 years ago my brother, best friend and I wanted sushi and this place was a mile away. It was wonderful! The servers are always amazing, the sushi is delicious and the prices are great. Been going there ever since."}
{"text":"Good sushi!  Quick and good quality.  Had lunch here- got my sushi fix.  Nothing fancy, but fresh and easy :)

I recommend if you're in area and hungry for sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi and service combine to make this quaint little restaurant 5 stars. The regular maki rolls are simple and delicious which is just the way i like it and although i don't like to get too crazy or fancy their specialty rolls are quite good too! The chicken udon noodle dish is also fantastic! Our server over our multiple visits has now gotten to remember our faces and order which just adds a special touch of attention and service you just don't get anywhere anymore . LOVE Mizu!"}
{"text":"When one thinks of sushi in Northeast Ohio, a place on the border of Parma next to a Subway and a convenience store is not going to come to mind. Thankfully though, the check cashing place is no longer there. As a result I had driven past it many a time without a second thought. A few months ago I figured that I might as well give it a shot.

I'm glad I did, to put it lightly. The service has been attentive each time I have been there, and the decor is nice. What surprised me is that rarely have I seen anyone else eating there. Either I'm there at the wrong times or others have made the same assumption I did. I had miso soup a couple of times while they prepared the sushi, and it is just the right blend of ingredients. I'm a snob when it comes to miso so impressing me with that is a big deal.

As for the star, the sushi, it is made fresh with care and it shows. The $3 happy hour rolls are delicious, and the specialty rolls are even better. The Parma rolls in particular have become my all-time favorite, despite the fact that it is not so much sushi as it is crab on a ball of rice.

After eating here, having sushi at the buffets and other restaurants in the area just isn't the same.  It's a must try if you are in the area, especially on Tuesday or Wednesday since one can easily fill up on two of the $3 basic rolls available on those days."}
{"text":"Sushi was very good here! We had the spicy tuna, spicy salmon, Ohio role and the rainbow roll. 

They followed my cardinal rule of not layering my sushi with sauce or other crap... For me this really allows for the flavor of the fish to come out and it shows that they aren't trying to hide any poor quality fish.

My only wish is that took American Express."}
{"text":"Mizu was not a bad sushi place for Cleveland! I ordered a lobster roll (favorite!) among other specialty rolls that didn't require soy sauce and wasabi. It was pretty decent although the fish didn't taste especially fresh. But what can you expect from Cleveland, right? My only qualm about this place was that they were pretty slow. Despite having only 1 other person in the restaurant the wait for our food was especially long, and they came out one at a time. Not bad though, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover. This place is fantastic. The sushi is top notch and service is even better. Who cares it's across from Walmart. Been here many times and each time is just as good. I know they also offer restaurant.com coupons. Typical roles are great but try the Parma roll. Very solid. Don't dismiss because of location or you will miss out."}
{"text":"Their sushi is excellent and so fresh.  The only items I would not recommend are their noodle dishes with beef or chicken, as the meat comes out so dry and tasteless.  Their pork tonkatsu off the appetizer menu is very good as well as their seaweed salad.  We've tried sushi on all sides of NEO.  It's great to have a place in Parma that knows how to do amazing, fresh sushi, comparable to downtown or Tremont places.  Great atmosphere too.  Definitely check this place out!  Also, their regular sushi rolls are $3 all day on Tuesdays/Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 Our waitress and the other staff were amazing. Soo, good.
Fish Quality: 0/10 Got sashimi and Nigiri in a love boat. It was not good quality. It is the worst fish I have ever eaten at a sushi place. I expected it to be good, and as someone who eats a lot of sushi I did not expect it to make me feel sick, but it did. 
Extras: 3/5 Soup and salad were fine.  And the salad dressing was a gritty texture."}
{"text":"The sushi here is super fresh and on Wednesdays they have all day happy hour on all of their regular rolls. I ordered the orange roll and the crouching tiger which was more than enough to fill me up! The crouching tiger although $15 did have a generous amount of sashimi layered on top. The only downside to going on Wednesdays was slower service, as there were only 2 servers for the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another chance after giving it a pretty harsh review a few years ago. By the way, ever look at your old reviews and think, \"Wow, I sound like such a prick\"? No? Just me? Anyway...

Came here for sushi happy hour. Their HH menu is kinda small, with rolls that didn't really appeal to me, so I ended up supplementing my original order with some regular menu items. HH rolls I tried were shrimp tempura, futomaki, and spicy tuna. The shrimp tempura roll was good. The futo was OK. The spicy tuna was not so much. All three rolls were much smaller than what you can get at other places. The futo in particular actually looked like a half roll.

The regular menu items were the Winter Roll, a specialty roll which was pretty good despite how bland it looked, and a chirashi entree, which I usually get to test how good a sushi restaurant's raw fish offerings are. It wasn't very good here. The fish was uncomfortably warm and tasteless.

I left with a better impression than the last time, but still think this place is just OK. Still better options out there.

Oh and I just remembered that our waittress called the chirashi \"sarachi\", which I've heard people use to mispronounce \"sriracha\", and the futomaki \"photo-maki\". Lol? You're a waitress and you can't pronounce the menu items? C'mon Man!"}
{"text":"Literally the best sushi in town. Nothing even comes close. And don't forget the traditional miso soup or chicken katsu also two of my faves from there. There's a reason the were voted on of the top 5 sushi places in Cleveland and wherever you are it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"I'm giving Mizu an extra star for the pure surprise factor. When Mizu first opened, I was really afraid to try out a sushi place, in Parma...in a small strip mall. I've been here probably 7 or 8 times and gotten something different each time and have yet to come away disappointed. I love sushi and try it all over the place, so to have something so fresh and creative here in Parma is literally baffling. 

It's tough to recommend anything because everyone's preferences vary, but while I love sushi and sashimi, their creative rolls are really excellent. My one and only complaint though is that the portions are on the smaller side. 

Overall, it's an outstanding, unassuming place in a city you'd least expect it to be."}
{"text":"This is for mostly just the sushi as my group didn't really order anything else.  There was six of us and we each ordered a different roll.  We also tried the tempura sweet potatotes which were crispy and good and some special appetizer that tasted just like crab rangoon.  
I actually haven't been to that many sushi places in Cleveland but this one was really good.  I ordered the sashimi platter.  16.95 for 14 pieces of sashimi, salad and miso soup.  That really is one of the best prices I've seen anywhere.  I like having the chef pick the cuts of fish.  Usually if you do get the sashimi, the chef gives whatever is the freshest and best at the moment.  Our platter pretty much rocked.  So so so good.  It had salmon (never go wrong there), tuna, white fish, mackerel and toro.  Raw fish is one of my absolute favorite things on this earth so I just went to town on it.  It was hard sharing it but everything else looked so tempting I gave it up.  
My favorite of the other rolls were the Iron Man and the Fire Island.  I was in a sushi coma and don't really remember the names of the other ones.  But everything was either delicious to pretty standard.  
We had the fried bananas and red bean mochi for dessert.  The mochic was just two mochi balls cut up with whipped cream.  Something I could make at home.  The fried bananas were hot and mushy inside with a tempura batter.  They were pretty good and given to us by the manager/owner/sushi chef.  
The service was really good as well.  However, one thing I wasn't a fan of is that as soon as I sat down i was given a cup of tea.  After receiving my bill I saw that I was charged 1.95 for it.  I probably would have ordered it anyways but it's nice to have the option.  Oh well, it's not going to stop me from coming back!"}
{"text":"Whenever we travel we always seek out sushi restaurants and Mizu did not disappoint.  We found the variety of sushi rolls intriguing and will return to try more. During our visit we tried the Parma, rock and roll, green hat, and green dragon rolls.  The Parma roll was our favorite and may be the best roll I've ever had, I HIGHLY recommend it! The rock and roll was great too and definitely something we'll try again!  The restaurant was packed at 6pm on a Sunda. Luckily we had reservations and didn't wait long.  Since the restaurant was crowded, it was noisy but we didn't mind as it made it kid friendly for our 10 month old baby. The restaurant is quite small and the tables are extremely close.  Service was friendly and helpful.  We did find wait times to be lengthy as the servers seemed overwhelmed by the busyness of the restaurant and weren't always attentive.  Regardless, the food was phenomenal and we will be returning!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Easily one of the best sushi spots in Cleveland! I had the Hawaiian and Parma rolls and both were awesome"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. I got the bbq squid as an appetizer, perfectly cooked and lightly seasoned. The portion was plentiful. The soft shell crab was sweet and incredible. A little dissapointed they were out of the toro and the uni, but in my mind i figure it was fresh so they dont order a lot of it, so thats good. The red clam sashimi was clean and fresh.  Interior was clean and the staff was friendly. Prices were very fair for the cuisine and the quality, plus $3 regular rolls on tuesday and wednesday. The plating was beautiful.  The house salad was fresh and dressing was fantastic. All the sushi was fresh and high quality!  It was so good I got take out for later!"}
{"text":"Good! I ordered take out based off of all the good reviews. I got a tofu roll, peanut avocado, and sweet potato roll. All of them were pretty tasty! The tofu roll was my favorite. The woman working at the counter was extremely nice, and told me that this is a family business, which makes me happy. When I return, I'll make sure it's during the happy hour where select rolls are 3 dollars. That seems like a good deal for what you're getting. They also have other menu items, so it isn't completely sushi. I believe I saw udon noodles as well as teriyaki. I'll be back here to try more!"}
{"text":"What else is to say that hasn't already been said? Total hole in the wall, but decent sushi, good price! 

Love the pictures of all the different types of sushi! But why I dropped a star was one roll that was \"on special\" was awful, unfortunately I can't remember the name, but just beware. 

Good, cheap place to check out!"}
{"text":"OK, they have great food, but the service is seriously awful. They are nice enough, but it's like they have NO idea how to split up sections. It seems like whoever is standing around will take the order...or not, depending on of one's of the sushi chef's (not sure that's the correct term) screams at them to wait on you. 
This is the 3rd time that's happened. I almost want to grab the manager and tell him how to seat and wait on tables. I feel bad because I love the food. 
For instance, I went last weekend and almost left because I couldn't get a drink, yet the server was constantly piling on food at the table right next to me, all while pretending that I wasn't there. 
There were a total of 4 tables, including lonely ol' me, sitting alone (natch). 
I really hope they get it together. I tipped the server because I'm not a dick, but I certainly didn't do more than 10%. 
I really just wanted to not eat at home alone. I didn't want entertainment, but I DID want to eat. 
Anyway, I'd give the food 4 stars, but with the service....nope."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to pop in casually, order a few rolls and enjoy a quick dinner without paying sushi lounge prices. The rolls are huge and the fish tasted quality. The menu is pretty big and they have all the basics, plus some interesting special rolls. Happy hour all day Tuesdays and Wednesdays, so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite local sushi place. Choices are amazing menu is very large .Favorites are the peppered tuna and raw scallops . However can't go wrong with any roll. Service is spot on . Also enjoy the sake menu."}
{"text":"Felt the urge for sushi while in town on business.  This place was close to my hotel, and highly reviewed.  Glad I went.  It was very good.  It sits in the middle of a small strip of stores, very unassuming.  When I walked in, I was surprised - on a Tuesday night, the place was packed.  This was a good sign I thought.  

I tried the miso soup, it was good, but nothing exceptional.  I ordered two rolls - the Philadelphia roll and the Hot Roll.  Delicious.  No complaints at all.  But the best surprise was yet to come - the bill.  This place is REALLY well priced.  My meal, with tip, was $20.  You can't beat that, and I understand why it was so busy,  Good quality and great pricing.  If you're in the area, stop in, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Recently checked this place out. Quick service and they have half off Tuesday night's on sushi! All the food was freshly made. They should definitely expand or get a bigger location."}
{"text":"(By the way - the area code is 216 and not 614 - I put in for Yelp to change this, but we'll see how long it takes.)

The 20% off discount goes through the end of this week!!

After the 20% discount ends, I am told there will be a daily Happy Hour from 4:30-6:00 which will feature Regular Rolls for $3.00. There is also a Daily Special which is a different deal every day on 2 Special Rolls from the sushi bar, and 1 Entree from the kitchen.

Today was my second time back (this time for lunch). The employees are so nice!! They were very accommodating to my requests. I tried a Tofu Teriyaki bento box. It's served with miso soup, house salad (yes, the dressing does contain mayonnaise but I got oil and vinegar instead), steamed rice, tofu & vegetables (teriyaki style). Normally it comes with a California Roll and shumai (shrimp dumpling), but they were nice enough to substitute an avocado roll. All of that for $6.95 - I was more than satisfied (and am now a little sleepy)!!

Oh, and the music today was very pleasant - instrumental and very appropriate for the setting.

Give this place a try soon!!! Catch the 20% off while you can, and then don't forget about the Happy Hour!!"}
{"text":"Very glad to find such a good sushi spot in Cleveland. Sashimi is really fresh and rolls are outstanding. I'm from California so it's really hard to find a good Asian restaurant in any other city but this restaurant is a real hidden germ. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I visited this location when craving the old occupant's Wonton soup.

Lucky enough for me, I like Japanese as well as Sushi.

We had Sushi since it was on special for 3.00 and it was pretty good.

Not much else to say....great atmosphere....cool chef and waitress....fresh rice and the roll was rolled perfectly.

Id go here again for Sushi...didnt try much else but options seem ok."}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland to see our Son and have a Sushi lunch. Found Mizu on Yelp and after reviewing the menu and ratings we decided to give them a try. They have a large menu and the \"Sunny\" roll was excellent as was the Unagi.  Overall, we had a good experience . Food was above average with good service. We'll definitely return the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"What a delightful quaint quiet little restaurant!!
The servers are friendly and attentive and the food is fresh and flavorful!
I had an assortment of veggie sushi and was very happy with my orders.
The miso soup is wonderful!!
I loved that the tamago sushi was perfectly done, most places don't hit the sweetness of the omelette, this place does. The tempura was perfectly crisp and not oily. 
Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Ended up ordering the steak and shrimp teriyaki, it was literally 4 shrimp(with tails still on), a piece of steak(that wasn't very good) on a bed of onions. The meal was very dissapointing for 20$."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!! Had the Toro tonight it was so good! Will be back when I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi I've had around Cleveland. Don't let the exterior and location scare you away. The service is great, the sushi is delicious and Monday and Tuesday is $3 rolls all day. Their miso soup is better than most, and I was excited to see a hot pot on the menu which was also delicious. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a great sushi place I loved when I lived in Pittsburgh. It's in a strip mall but clean inside. Not crazy odd selections of fish but enough variety. I got the eel sushi, my bf got the Philadelphia roll and spicy tuna roll (he's a bit less adventurous as me) and the green dragon roll and the yellow tail with jalapeño appetizer.  I can't speak to the price overall but it seemed reasonable. We will be going back for sure. Sushi win for the west side!"}
{"text":"I don't know how to rate this place. Really. They have a good selection of sushi and sashimi if you are looking for variety of that sort. The big plus is that there are no hibachi grill and no obnoxious people at ogling at the flaming onion tower.
I love japanese food and would venture to say from my lunch experience today, they are almost there. They lack in a certain quality about they way they prepared their dishes.
I'll share a few things. I ordered a few items to see how they do overall. So here's what I ordered. From the lunch menu: Chicken Katsu Bento Box (comes with salad and miso soup), yakitori, and salmon sashimi. Can't really comment about miso soup or the salad. Pretty standard for american japanese cuisine dining experience. The sashimi was fresh and nicely presently but a bit pricy (3 for 2 piece). 
And this is where they lack in that certain Japanese quality. The rice on their bento box is long grain jasmine rice. Sorry. But that's not japanese. Short grain and starchy for bento box, please. The other item i felt was not up to par was their yakitori. The chicken was boiled and teriyaki sauce was poured over it after it was skewered with pieces of green pepper and onion. Yakitori is supposed to be grilled. so if you're serving yakitori you better make sure there's some sort of flame doing some caramelization. That's how you make the yaki real tori. really. 

So the long and short of my review is this, sushi, sushi rolls and sashimi are a go. Others, I'll hold off.

Don't get me wrong. They service was excellent. They were attentive and for the most part easy to understand. So if you're in for some sushi or sashimi. Give Mizu a try, if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This a great little sushi spot. Even better on Tuesdays and Wednesdays when they have half off regular rolls. So you can get after it with some sushi here. It's not high end sushi, but it's just good sushi at a good price. 

The staff is friendly and the noise level depends on day/time like most places. Tables are close so it can get a little loud on busy days. Days like today it was super quiet with minimal traffic.

The quality of the fish is good. I've eaten here for 3 or 4 years and never had an issue. The specialty rolls are great and filling. The regular rolls that are half price vary, I believe by the traffic that is in there. Today there was only a few people and the rolls were perfect and had just the right amount of rice and fillings. On slammed half price sushi days the rice can be a little light leaving the rolls looking like dogs with mange. (Again, still quality, just low on rice to where you can see the seaweed wrap through the rice. Sorry, couldn't think of a better way to illustrate it. Avid sushi eaters will know what I mean.). Inconsistency on the rice amounts on the rolls is the only reason I docked it a star.

The Alaska (smoked salmon and avocado) is my favorite and their Hot Roll is pretty popular with my gluten eating coworkers.

Anyway, it's a great little spot. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Went there with some friends and my son for lunch. So happy to find that they have a sushi Wednesday, the regular maki rolls are only $3.00! Anyway, the service was great and the sushi was awesome. I did splurge? a little and got the Fire Island roll asking with some of the regular maki. I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Giving this place five stars for the yummy sushi, but especially for the prices and the service! Great find. We got the dinner combo that let us have two miso soups, two salads, and three basic rolls for $15!! We added one specialty roll, the Crouching Tiger, and it was to die for. Highly recommend if you are looking for affordable sushi in the Cleveland/Old Brooklyn/Parma area!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now and I gotta say, I have not once been disappointed. I have had several of the special rolls, along with maki and nigiri and all have been fresh and delicious. The first time I went, my friends and I sat at the bar and the sushi chef gave us a bowl of what I believe was crab salad to try on the house. It was excellent! The miso soup is souper (haha) tasty. I wish I could make it exactly like theirs at home. The servers and chefs are always very friendly and whenever I order the sushi deluxe, where the chef gets to pick what fish you get, I like that the server tells you what exactly you're getting when they bring it to you. I am also a fan of the prices. I live just down the street from Voodoo Tuna but I would rather drive to Parma to go here than drive just down the street to that overpriced joke of a place. 

The ONLY thing I will say that could be considered a \"negative\" is that they don't have yum yum sauce, which is quite delicious on fried rice. But I think I'll survive just fine without since everything else is great!"}
{"text":"There was a groupon for this little Japanese place in Parma so I went to go check it out tonight.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this restaurant is in a strip mall.  In fact, it's right next to a gas station and it's nestled between a Subway and a convenience store with \"check cashing\" written on its windows.  However, the decor inside feels like a Japanese restaurant, it's nice and clean, and it attracts a decent clientele, both Asian and not.

They have regular rolls, special rolls, and signature rolls.  The regular rolls and the sashimi are very small.  Seriously, they are tiny and will not fill you up.  However, the special rolls and signature rolls are a good size.  They are very creative with these rolls, almost to a fault - for instance, I'm just not sure how well the large amount of mayo, mango and shrimp tempura really jived with each other.  However, the fish were very fresh.

The service is fantastic and they check on you very often.  They must have refilled my water maybe 7 or 8 times tonight, and that's not because I drank 7 full glasses of water.

They offer buy 3 get 1 free rolls on Saturday (can't be combined w/ groupon) as well as $3 roll happy hours from 4:30-6pm each day and all day Tuesday and Wednesday."}
{"text":"We were greeted with Welcome Home! As it has been a couple years since we were here. We ordered the Christmas roll and the 2 in 1 roll. Both sushi rolls were amazing!  They were full of flavor, melted in your mouth while various textures from soft to crunchy were very pleasing to the palate. We were very happy with their service. If you are a fan of Arashi Japan in Westlake, then this place is similar in quality, but with a greater variety from dinner to dessert sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem of Parma. For a city that is full of chain restaurants, Mizu is a diamond in the rough. It's tucked away in a little shopping plaza. If you aren't looking for it, it's hard to be found. The sushi is pretty great for a Parma sushi spot. It's always fresh and arrives to the table quickly. They have a wide array of sushi options. I personally really like the stoplight roll. If you go on Tuesday's or Wednesday's then they have really great sushi deals. Service has always been a little spotty, at least when it gets busy, so for that reason I prefer to go on weekdays when it's less busy. Definitely my favorite spot in the area!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Crouching tiger roll,spicy mayo on the side.  Love this place!  My husband gets the Winter Roll.  If you are not a nori or raw fish person, the winter roll is a great choice because it has a soy wrapper instead of nori with tempura shrimp...I have never had a disappointing visit here

One of my new favorites, SAKURA ROLL!!!  YUM!"}
{"text":"I went there mainly to try out their $3 sushi menu. I ordered the spicy tuna and shrimp tempura roll for lunch. They were both very tasty! There were 6 pieces in the tuna and 5 for the tempura. If you are craving sushi and don't want to spend a lot their regular rolls are very affordable and taste good as well. The Resteraunt was half filled when I went and the service was still great. I didn't wait long for my sushi and my water was topped off frequently. They have $3 rolls Tuesday and Wednesday all day, and from 4-6p the rest of the week. Next time I go for lunch I want to try their bento boxes."}
{"text":"I thought to myself what's the purpose of writing a review for a place that already has a five star rating. Because they deserve it!!!. Sushi was great, the service was great.  It was A busy night. While I was waiting they provided me a complementary crunchy crab salad. It was a nice touch

I will be returning there again and again."}
{"text":"Love this sushi place! Super affordable prices and consistently quality sushi. They have a huge selection of specialty rolls and all the ones I've tried have been really good. My favorite was the sushi boat for two, which had a really good assortment of sashimi and nigiri and two rolls. For a small extra charge, you can choose the specialty rolls that you want on the boat, which was definitely worth it. This place has the most affordable, best value sushi out of any of the sushi restaurants I have tried in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I've only been here for sushi and have never been disappointed. Good sushi, good prices (especially during happy hour and Wednesdays). Large selection of special rolls as well as the basic rolls."}
{"text":"I had a few subpar experiences here the first few times I visited a few years ago. Granted it was busy, but the server was forgetful of drinks (I like my booze) and the food didn't seem very fresh. 

I was craving some sushi after work one day and decided to give this place another shot with a carryout. I was not disappointed. The pepper tuna alone reeled me back. Also, I haven't seen that waitress again. 

This place is now a go to little date night spot for my boyfriend and me. The staff here is really friendly and attentive. I like sitting at the sushi bar. I typically order sashimi, pepper tuna, shrimp tempura roll, and miso soup. It's all very good. My boyfriend orders the crazy, Americanized rolls and he loves them. This is a quiet, relaxed spot."}
{"text":"This place is definitely amazing! So Wednesday's they have half off of specific sushis which is delicious!  They fish has always been fresh to me which was the reason why I keep coming back.  I never tried anything else besides the sushi and chicken katsu.  Their chicken katsu is always so moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.  I've never been disappointed with their service or food here and definitely recommend this place to anyone craving fresh sushi or sashimi!"}
{"text":"Mizu is one of my favorite spots for sushi. My husband always said the pieces were too small, but I disagree. $3 rolls on Tuesday! Friendly wait staff, high quality sushi, just delicious. Try the Snow White. Huge pieces of three different fishes wrapped elegantly in pink seaweed with avocado...just heavenly."}
{"text":"I read the positive reviews and was eager to try this place this past weekend. It was not what I was hoping for. The atmosphere left much to be desired due to the large screen tv perpetually stuck on the infomercial channel. Sushi with a side of hair regrowth formula? Yuck! 

The fish was quite good with the exception of all of the tempura which were served stone cold. The Philly roll was all cream cheese with just a tiny bit of fish. Disappointing. The Christmas roll and the Rock and roll were both delicious and the spicy tuna was good. Maybe they just had an off night but I think from now on I'll stick with Ohashi in North Olmsted."}
{"text":"Wonderfully fresh and unique sushi!! They have options for every taste. 
The service is great, even at peak busy hours."}
{"text":"They do not disappoint!  Christmas roll, Parma balls.  Amazing!!!   There's a reason they have such great reviews!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  I can't say enough about Mizu Sushi.  I've been there 3 times now and thus far everything is just fantastic."}
{"text":"Ah another great place to eat sushi! Took my friends for a Ladies night and we loved it"}
{"text":"From the outside you would consider turning around, especially being in a strip mall.  If you are smart you will venture inside and see what this small but nice place has to offer.  Good food, reasonable prices, polite staff, and a very hospitable owner."}
{"text":"There was a Mizu where I used to live so I figured this one wouldn't be bad. The sushi (philadelphia rolls) was delicious, however the service was terrible. My online order didn't go through until 30minutes after I got there and the woman who was being hostess got very upset with me for coming and asking for an order that wasn't there. But as I sat waiting, I heard them yell my order with my name, half an hour later. Not only was I way over my lunch by the time I even got back, but they forgot chopsticks and my eel sauce. I will make the drive to the Mizu in Warren/Niles. This one was just disappointing."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi and best service. Might look like a hole in the wall from outside but don't let that fool you. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant I have ever been to.  They have a wide variety of rolls that go beyond the basic California roll.  My personal favorite is the pink lady.  The sauce served with it is so delicious you will be scraping the plate.  This place is great to take new sushi eaters as their menu come with a picture book.   It's much easier to order based on the picture book then the menu.   Thus is an absolute must sushi place  for all clevelanders."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I looked to the Yelp reviews for this one. My friend and I were in the sushi mood and wanted a place we had never been before. So I checked Yelp! This place had some great reviews. The people love it and I was sold.

Our server was wonderful! A little strange and he liked to talk a lot but that's not always a bad thing. He was very attentive and made sure our water was always full. We had a hard time choosing what to order, so we got three! The volcano rock was brought to the table first. I wasn't crazy about this one but it had to do with the honey mustard flavored sauce. I hate honey mustard you see, and it had a deep burn in your sinuses. I'm assuming there was some wasabi in it. I love spicy food but this was something completely different. It made me want to tear off my nose and drown it in my water. My friend loved it though, so I know that it was just my taste preferences.

Next we had the Parma roll and the Christmas roll. Both delightful! The Parma roll was a little hard to eat with chop sticks but it was very good. Anything with crab on it, I'm sold. The food was great and for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi restaurant w/ a full menu of rolls, entrees and appetizers. A hidden gem in Parma!highly recommended."}
{"text":"Halfway between Rt 77 and Rt 71 there is a little place named Parma.  Although not know for its culinary choices or eclectic taste, Parma and in particular the Brookpark and Tiedeman area, hide a jem.  If you can find Wal-mart, Sam's Club or Home Depot you can find Mizu Sushi.  When you drive up, don't be fooled by its strip mall location.  When you walk in, don't discouraged by its simplicity.  The food here is a treat.  Visually the chef makes sure to put the type of presentation together you cant find at any downtown location.  You can actually watch the his concentration while preparing each dish.  This is not just a meal, it is an art, and for some reason I had forgotten that.  Note that you may not eat at the exact same time as the rest of your group, they bring it as its made, but if you can share you are in for something special.  Start with a Mizu salad; crab, shrimp, salmon and a thin layer of avocado over it.  Don't miss the Christmas Roll with the freshest tuna, eel sauce, and a topper of spicy crab.  The Rock'n'Roll is crunchy and delicious.  The Parma Roll is great tribute to the last place I thought of when it comes to sushi perfection.   If you love sushi take 480 toward Tiedeman and look for an area called Parma."}
{"text":"We departed our home on a Saturday evening, craving some carry-out sushi...we turned to Yelp for some recommendations and decided to try Mizu after reading some of the reviews. It's not a great location, and the entire shopping plaza is a little run down, but hey, if good sushi awaits...

I am vegan, so I always sample the vegetable and tofu options offered by sushi restaurants, and I was very happy with the selection here. We ordered online (which was awesome) and I created some of my own rolls, which was great. I went veg-heavy and was pleasantly surprised by the size of the rolls and the quality of the ingredients. The tempura sweet potato sushi was a really nice treat - wow. Even my carnivorous husband wanted in on that action. 

The rolls were a great size and I thought the prices were good. Since I always stick with cheap vegetable sushi, I tend to be put off by places that charge a ton for basically rice and some cucumber. Not here. Here I felt like we were well taken care of. 

My husband went for the winter roll and the California roll and was really happy with both. 

After trying several sushi places in the area over the past few months, this is now officially our favorite."}
{"text":"This place is the spot to go for sushi. Great price, great sushi and great service. I go here all of the time. Top favorite rolls are the eel and the Alaska roll. The other thing i love about this place is they are not picky about letting you add other things to your sushi. Add cream cheese to any roll, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place! It's kind of in a random plaza but don't let that deter you. Delicious, inventive rolls - I like the Dragon and Mexican rolls and always very fresh. Occasionally get slow service but this is really a great place to grab some sushi!"}
{"text":"So delicious! We had the crouching tiger, naruto maki & spicy tuna tartar and the amazing rolls. And our server Emily was fantastic! Can't wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"Sushi menu was on par. Staff was very friendly and patient with my ordering/questions. I thought it was too good to be true - then I got the sushi. Out of this world! Very good experience and will certainly be going back for my sushi needs!"}
{"text":"Let me just say, the sushi is delicious.  The food was not the issue.  Came here on  Wednesday night around 5:30 and waited an hour for our food.  Our appetizer was also forgotten about, but they did bring us a one eventually.  The waiter was very apologetic about the appetizer and the wait.  They seemed understaffed and very crowded.  
They do pick up, though! Probably going to go that route next time."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much from this strip mall sushi joint, but groupon in hand, I was ready for my sushi fix. 

The dining room was extremely small and crowded but not to the point where it was a turn off. 

We went with the crazy no 1 roll and another specialty roll with spicy tuna and crab, along with Philly roll, sweet potato roll, and spicy shrimp roll. All of them were good with the two specialty rolls being the stand outs. It was enough for two of us and the sushi was all good! Although, with all of the other sushi joints around I probably wouldn't come back here without a coupon or something. Or maybe for the $3 regular rolls all day Tuesday and Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in the Brooklyn area. Don't judge it by the fact that it is across from Walmart and next to a sketchy mini-Mart.  This place has outstanding sushi and you won't be disappointed.  The sushi chefs are very creative with the endless variety of special rolls.  I'm a big fan of the sushi and sashimi dinner."}
{"text":"Yummy, fast sushi, friendly staff!

The location isn't the best, but the inside is quite nice.

I ordered some sashimi, a house salad (I LOVE GINGER dressing - yum!) and a sakura roll.  Everything was delicious!

The waitress was super sweet.  If I'm back for work, I will return!"}
{"text":"Great service! 
Menu includes a great variety of food. We ordered a sushi combination and the suki yaki (a Japanese hot pot). There was nothing particularly wrong about them, but they were not impressive either. Pricing is reasonable."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are obsessed with sushi and we are thrilled to have found Mizu in Parma! We have been there twice now and cannot wait to go back. On top of their amazing sushi selection, their customer service is top notch. The sushi is also priced right and they have a happy hour. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the Cleveland area and was in search of quality sushi, and Mizu's has delicious fresh sushi and a lot of variety. I've made it a point to try out new rolls every time I dine in or take out, and I have never been disappointed. I generally order take out because during peak hours it's way too busy in the restaurant and service is not ideal. I once dined in with a friend during their half off rolls special and our rolls sat on the sushi bar counter for a good thirty minutes because the waiters were too busy with the influx of customers to serve us. So I would definitely recommend just ordering out, because they are very timely with their take out orders. Also Mizu's is great for people who are new to sushi, because they have sushi picture books that let you know what to expect."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here after our normal Vietnamese place was close. This place was great. Their menu was big with a lot of different options. My hubby got the 1-in1 which had tuna, salmon, crunch and avocado. It was amazing. A friend got the hot roll which he liked and they split a Mexican roll which had a jalapeño pepper on top. It was fresh, unique and delicious. This was a great find and well worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  tried to order online i guess it did not go through and then someone that was clearly an employee was taunting me from a table."}
{"text":"It takes forever for the food to come out and the quality isn't that great. Not worth the price and waiting time. Will not return."}
{"text":"?????! (Amazing!)
        Cleveland is surprisingly, or unsurprisingly, home to many wonderful sushi bars - Mizu is one of the best and nestled south of the city in Parma, which I wouldn't have expected.  This joint has some of the best Sushi I've had in the Great State of Ohio, and so many great options too! Which makes it hard to choose from, but as far as problems go, that's not a bad one to have.
         Mizu is located in a quiet but nice little strip mall and the interior is cozy and welcoming.  As my fiancèe and I were greeted, the waitress was very nice, quick, and helpful in deciding.  We also appreciated the book of images and labels for each of their sushi rolls. We decided on the 2 roll lunch special with Miso soup and a salad, which was a great deal.  Each of our rolls were awesomely delicious, from the crab, cali, salmon, and peanut rolls.  Their peanut roll was crunchy and offers a different take on sushi that was a nice change.  Our service was swift and attentive as well which made the experience great as well.  They also seem to have a selection of great of sake which I will be sure to try on our next visit.
      As I mentioned, their menu is very extensive (and delicious sounding!) and we absolutely cannot wait to come back.  Next time, I'll try their bento boxes which offer up a nice and varied assortment of sushi, shrimp shumai, and other options.  They also have a really great happy hour from 430-6pm with the great deal of $3 rolls. Hell Yes, this will for sure be our new Happy Hour sushi joint, you can't beat that.
      Mizu is a great and authentic Japanese sushi restaurant with a welcoming vibe, great options, delicious sushi, and plenty of Sake and Sapporo to go around!
      Now excuse me as I go watch Spirited Away...Sushi always puts me in the mood for one of Miyazaki's classic films :)"}
{"text":"We found this place by searching nearby restaurant. Saw that the reviews seem to be great so we decided to give it a try. The place is pretty small but still very full at 8pm on a Saturday. Food came pretty slowly because I think they only had one or two chef making the food. Service was great. The waitress was funny and came check with us very frequently and kept our water cup full throughout.

Food wise, we ordered sashimi regular, crouching tiger and sushi cake. The sashimi was fresh and the cut was decent, so pretty happy about that. The two sushis were very Americanized, but tasted pretty good, especially the crouching tiger. Lots of that crunchy tempura flakes on top with spicy mayo and that eel sauce. Overall I'd give it a four star because of the service and decent food. One less star because this restaurant is very Americanized, especially their sushi, but I guess that's their selling point too."}
{"text":"I gave this place the benefit of my doubt and tried it after hearing such amazing reviews from coworkers.  I must say, I am so glad I did! Upon recommendation, I ordered a teriyaki chicken bento box. It was incredible!! It comes with a whole chicken breast, a California roll, 2 shrimp dumplings, rice, a salad, and miso soup all for the bargain price of $8!!!  I also called ahead so they would have it ready when I arrived and they had it all set up at a table and covered in Saran Wrap to keep it warm.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I really can't think of
One bad thing to say..5stars all the way around!"}
{"text":"I generally try not to complain about businesses and generally try to live by the \"if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all\" rule.... But the things is, I have soooo many nice things to say about this place. It's great! But, the last couple of times have been nothing short of infuriating. After my second to last visit, I kind of said \"Never Again\", but went back this past Wednesday and had pretty much the SAME thing happen again... I really hope Mizu pinpoints what is causing the problems and fixes it, because it really is a great place. 

On my latest visit: my boyfriend and I stopped in on Wednesday (which happens to be $3 roll night). The place was pretty busy, but we were seated right away....and then waited 20 minutes for anyone to bring water or menus. We ordered our wine and sushi right away, because we didn't know when or if the waitress would ever come back if we took any more time. An hour later (literally, almost to the minute), we reached the point of that awkward \"Should we pay for our drinks and just leave? Where else would we go? By the time we drive somewhere else, the food here would be ready probably\" debate. But...we flagged down our waitress to see how much longer it would take. She picked \"5 minutes\" as her arbitrary answer, and we decided to wait it out. Fifteen to 20 minutes later, she came back and said they were working on our order then.  

So... About 10 minutes after that, we got our order. It was, as always, crazy delicious and perfect - and of course the $3 deal is amazing. 

BUT - I was very disappointed overall with the way the staff dealt with the long wait times. There was a lot of unhappy murmuring: Every other table was getting as confused and grumpy as we were, and no one got any kind of apology or explanation or acknowledgement or ANYTHING. Just a long, inexplicable wait time.  Surprisingly, only one table actually spoke up about the ridiculous long wait and lack of service, to which the manager loudly announced: \"Sorry, we have a lot of carry-out orders!\" 

That's totally understandable, but... I've gotta think that the restaurant would want to prioritize the customers who are physically in the restaurant, especially when the wait time ends up being, from beginning to end, nearly two hours. 

I won't say \"Never Again\", because the sushi really is delicious, but... I'm thinking carryout is probably the way to go from now on."}
{"text":"i now live 1300 miles away, but always make a point to visit at least once when i'm in town. they are all so friendly and hospitable, the food is creative with a large selection (my favorite is the christmas roll!), and it is a comfortable place to meet with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I really liked the inside...some reviews point out that it is small and doesn't have the best decor...but I thought it was small and intimate. As far as the actual food..amazing. I went with my aunt and uncle, and none of us were familiar with Japanese food. I happen to be allergic to fresh water fish so was always extremely hesitant about trying food so dependent on fish. But I got a beef dish and my aunt and uncle got other dishes including the Parma roll. The presentation was absolutely gorgeous, and the food itself so well crafted and beautiful to just look at.  And the food itself...we all shared each others food and thought it was so flavorful and delicious that we couldn't wait to come back again.  If you live within 25 miles...you really ought to come check them out. (I know...not the most eloquent review..but I've never cared enough to review a restaurant...but this place is special)"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Just as a lot of other reviewers have said. I always passed this place frequently until one day I read some reviews. I went in for happy hour an OH MY was the sushi delicious! The prices are reasonable even without happy hour the quality of sushi is some of the best I have ever had for the price point. I have now been to mizu at least 6 times. Try the Parma roll!"}
{"text":"Three words for this place ... The best sushi! I came here for early saturday evening for dinner on my way to a meeting. I don't usually go by Parma and I really wanted some good sushi so I decided to try this place ! This place looks a lot smaller from the outside than what it is. The place wasn't packed when I came in but it had few tables and booth to sit at. They do have a sushi area where you can see the chefs make the sushi and no bar area but they do sell alcohol! Soon as I was seated the server came with water and I ordered House salad as an appetizer. The house salad was just a bed of lettuce but their sauce that came with it was very good. It also came with miso soup which I enjoyed a lot during this cold winter Cleveland weather. Their menu is very interesting too which came with pictures of the sushi so you have an idea what it looks like. I really like that they do that ! I got the spicy salmon roll and their peppered tuna roll. One of the freshest nicest and the most tastiest sushi I have had in Cleveland! The place is clean, the service is really friendly and the sushi was amazing ! I will definetly be back for some more !"}
{"text":"Their super fresh and high quality ingredients have convinced me that this is the best sushi in Cleveland. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Mizu is a great value for sushi. There is a happy hour every day from 4:30 to 6 pm (except for Sunday). Regular rolls are $3 during this time window. I enjoy the sushi here more than at the lunch buffet at Tomo. Lunch specials at Mizu are excellent and affordable. A tofu bento box is around $7 with miso soup and salad. I enjoy Ginko although I would like to retire between the ages of 50-55. Pacific East is a nice place yet sometimes out of the way. Mizu has a calm atmosphere. The service is excellent.

I looked at the Yelp app on my last visit and noticed people discussing the Parker Roll. Parker Roll piqued my interest. My parents gave me the name of Parker before the name surged in popularity. Now it is acceptable to call your offspring wacky words like Parker. My friend Phil text messaged me today and thanked me for writing such good Yelp reviews. He also inquired about meeting for lunch in the near future because he is working nearby in Independence. He ended the conversation with the following:

Oh. Btw. The Parker roll at mizu is sort of named after you. Nikki n I used to go there all the time and they named a special roll after our kid Parker whom would most likely not have the name if I didn't know u. Mind blown?

Try the Parker Roll in my honor!"}
{"text":"I went at 2:20pm on a Wednesday to celebrate by taking out my partner to a birthday lunch on me. We were the only ones in there our entire lunch, which was fine with me but for some reason the whole time, it felt as if we were being rushed. We had till 3 to order maki rolls at the $3 price, the waitress just had to comment and say no need to rush but u need to order because the sushi bar is closing. Turned me off a little bit, She stood there impatiencently. I moved on and ordered and the food came about 10-15 minutes later.. edamame, then the spring rolls  finally the sushi. Everything was great, fresh and tasted on point with what i expected. But the waitress again was kinda like rude with her comments, like she just had to say \" well just hand it to me, cause she decided not to turn around\" .. because i didnt realize she was standing behind me waiting for me to hand her my plate!! So michelle grabbed it and handed it to her realizing thats what she was waiting for. Its like well, did u have to say that.. and why are u waiting for me to hand u my plate??... just very impatient, rushed.. a little irritating. BUT  the food was great and i would eat there again. Part 2 coming soon lol."}
{"text":"Former hidden sushi gem in Parma!

In this unsuspecting strip mall in the middle of Parma you will find what may be the one of top 3 sushi restaurants around!

There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said.  Small sushi joint that serves fresh sushi 7 days a week.  Half price sushi Tuesday and Wednesday and Saturday afternoon.  Get here early on those days or place a take out order, the restaurant is tiny and fills up quickly.  However service is quick and a wait isn't more than 20 minutes most times.

The menu is large and extensive.  They have sushi and Japanese both of which are quite tasty.  You can't go wrong with your basic sashimi or regular rolls.  The maki rolls are quite americanized (i.e. parma \"roll\") but there are some tasty options to be found.  

Some of my top choices:
- Christmas Roll - yellowfin, tuna and avocado roll, topped with spicy tuna, crunchy tempura and eel sauce
- sunny roll
- salmon lovers 
-seaweed salad - comes with cucumbers for a nice crunch
- any sashimi - it's always fresh
-pork tonkantsu -  tasty non sushi option

If you're looking for a good sushi restaurant that has decent prices, easy to locate and has free parking look no further than Mizu.  

Stop in, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am new to sushi and when I heard that some of the best sushi in Cleveland could be found in Parma I had my doubts. When I realized that Mizu was in a tiny strip mall by what looks to be a booze and lottery shop with a chain sandwich shop on the other side, I had second thoughts. I decided to give it a go and find out what it had to offer since it was highly recommended. Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted immediately and seated quickly. I am pretty sure that almost everyone said hello to us which was really nice. Our waitress was kind and timely. We decided to start things off with the spicy crab ragoons which were good. The portion was a good amount for an appetizer and the shells were packed with crab. We then had the christmas and volcano rock rolls. Both rolls were fresh and presented nicely. Each roll came with 8 pieces and was priced fairly. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and great service. I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"First off, the portions here are significantly larger than the other sushi places in town. My husband and I completely over committed by getting extra sushi rolls because we are so used to getting smaller sizes. We were so full and ended up taking extras home. Second, the fish, rice and other ingredients are very fresh. We are pretty picky about that and agreed that this has been the best so far in Cleveland. Third, the customer service was excellent. Raymond was our waiter and he always made sure we were doing okay and our drinks were full. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall hidden sushi place in the area. Delicious and unique combinations. Ask for the special menu book with pictures; some menu items are like works of art. Come here hungry and with friends so you can try a large variety. Only negative is that it is small and dark."}
{"text":"Excellent. Took a little time for our sushi to come out. Next time will order appetizers... Will be back again! Highly recommend the Crouching Tiger!"}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall sushi spot was more than expected. The service was quick and the sushi was so cheap! We went on a Tuesday and their regular roles were all $3. The sushi itself was really good, I just wish they had a wider selection of raw fish."}
{"text":"Still love Mizu - they have consistently fresh and tasty sushi. 

Recently tried the salmon lovers roll and it did not disappoint - if you love salmon, you have to try it!

I also recently tried their online ordering, and it worked well. It doesn't reflect happy hour prices so user beware of that. 

If you plan to dine-in on Tuesday or Wednesday ($3 happy hour maki roll days) be sure to allow extra time to be seated and eat as they are consistently busy. Bonus - they have recently made some modifications to the dining room that seems to allow for a but more seating, but there is still a wait more times than not. 

Also - there are still gift certificates available on restaurant.com for $25 off a $50 purchase. Only available at start of month due to popularity and not valid on happy hour specials. 

If you want a solid sushi experience for a good price, hit them up!"}
{"text":"A wise man once told me \"don't judge a restaurant by its strip mall location\". Totally true for this place. While the outside isn't super beautiful - the sushi plates are. We came on a Saturday evening and we're seated right away. Service was very good. And most importantly, the sushi was great! We had four rolls. The \"regular\" rolls were just as delicious as the \"specialty\" rolls. As we we're leaving I realized they have happy hour all day on Tuesday and Wednesday and 3 until 6 the other days. During happy hour all regular rolls are $3. Since these regular rolls are really good, that's quite a deal. I can't wait to come back and try some more! Who wants to go to happy hour with me?"}
{"text":"Went here last fall, sorry for the late review. We went a little later at night, around 7 or 8 pm. Restaurant was not crowded and our waiter was VERY attentive. I really cannot remember what we ordered (sorry) but I do remember that all of the sushi we ate was amazing. That is the important part! I really liked how the menu had a photo album of what each sushi dish looked like. Food for the eyes! The service and food were good, and I see no reason to go back. We will definitely visit again, especially because we live so  close by! Don't just write it off because it is in a strip mall!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews ever, however this was my first time going to this restaurant and I have to say not only is the service absolutely fantastic but the food is just as good and it is reasonably priced.   If you like sushi or bento boxes this is the place to go!!!  Don't pass this place up my friends!!

{"text":"A very small and slow uprising of Asian eateries on this side of town....welcome Mizu. Found this place on groupon and wanted to buy more after my encounter here. 

Service was excellent and attentive, albeit our waitress did not speak much English and had to flag another waitress to address our questions. Ordered Japanese curry on pork cutlet and a sashimi platter. The curry was good, much like the kind I used to get in Little Tokyo back in Los Angeles. For the sashimi platter, there were probably 15 pieces of nice sized fish (usual suspects...salmon, tuna etc). Each entrée also comes with miso soup and a salad. I love ginger dressing but man this place probably gave more dressing than actual salad, which I didn't mind, I thought was scrumptious.

Prices were great, easy accessible parking lot...overall great experience."}
