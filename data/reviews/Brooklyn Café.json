{"text":"Un petit café très sympa qui fait aussi showroom, l'ambiance est décontractée, le menu est simple mais efficace, les prix sont plutôt bas pour le quartier, le service est cool et sympa . Cela change de certains cafés branchés hors de prix et qui ont tendance à vous prendre un peu de haut parfois. Petit plus : une jolie terrasse à l'arrière qui permet de faire une pause hors de l'agitation !"}
{"text":"After stopping by Brooklyn Cafe for lunch today, I felt compelled to write again. I ordered the smoked trout sandwich to go. The place was packed, but the servers were calm and friendly. I watched as one of the prep chefs made my sandwich---I don't think I've ever seen such care go into a sandwich (sorry, Mom!): first came a layer of what tasted like goat cheese (though I think it had a fancier name on the menu), then she sprinkled it with three different types of spices. Next came the smoked trout, followed by a layer of fresh cucumber slices, some carefully-lain caperberries, followed by a mountain of greens, mint, more spices and olive oil, and capped with great bread. She was making two of these sandwiches simultaneously, and put so much time and attention into each one. I couldn't imagine her doing this over and over all day with the same care, but I was towards the end of the lunch rush, so clearly she does. They wrap it for you in wax paper, old-school style. It felt like a gift.

 This place is highly underrated, and consistently so (my last review here was from over a year ago)."}
{"text":"Lovely baked goods. Not a huge fan of that Fantini coffee from Rome, which is rather unremarkable, but at least they're not pushing it with strange roastings.

Gotta say, though, there's nothing nicer than hanging out in their folding deck chairs outside, on the sidewalk, on a warm sunny day. Very welcome addition to this changing tech design district, even if the coffee is not the most memorable."}
{"text":"No wifi
I am off coffee right now so can't speak for that but the hot chocolate is very bland. I took one sip and left the rest. No flavour :/
It's more of a grab a coffee to go for Ubisoft likely

I won't be back"}
{"text":"Thanks to the Coffee Passport, I tried out Brooklyn Cafe.  I probably wouldn't have otherwise, it's tucked into the section of St-Viateur that I rarely pass through, and open only during daytime (working) hours.  

The coffee I had was fine.  Nothing particularly amazing but not bad either, just unremarkable.  The setup was interesting, Brooklyn is part cafe, part furniture shop, but I felt like I wasn't sure where I was supposed to be allowed to sit or roam with my coffee.  The staff were very friendly, but it unfortunately friendly staff alone cannot make for an awesome experience.  I dunno, the whole thing just didn't do it for me, though I really wanted it to.

Reading all these reviews, I think I may have to pass by again and try out the food, because that really seems to be where it's at.  Might be tough, considering the opening hours and the fact I work 9-5 downtown, but perhaps a nice treat on a future day off."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and wonderful. All of it. Soups. Salads. Sandwiches. Desserts. Just delicious. You'll love it. Prices are totally reasonable. Coffee, however, needs some attention. 

No tables. Just relatively narrow bar seating gets cramped and rather full at lunch time. As much as I love mid-century vintage design, the space occupying the rather unremarkable shop in the back could be put to much, much better use.

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food, atmosphere, service and outside patio area (located behind the restaurant, a bit hidden) makes this one of my favourite restaurants to go to. Bonus: it's quite affordable and service is fast enough to be out within less than an hour! 

There's always a soup and main entree of the day + seasonal entrees + regular items, meaning enough variety to feel different each time yet enough stability to ensure you find something you like. 

Regular favourites: soup of the day (no matter which one, always delicious). If you have a small appetite like me you can get away with just a large soup for lunch, it's very cheap! Another one of my favourites is the trout & labneh plate.

Current season's favourites (Summer) : Tostadas.

Definitely try this, I love it and bet you will too!"}
{"text":"Je suis surprise que cette place soit si peu connue. Délicieux plats méditerranéens, personnels sympathiques. À découvrir"}
{"text":"A nice spot for coffee, although I can only vouch for the bottled maple syrup cold brew. The space is nice but a bit too busy, with a furniture shop and a bit of a confusing seating arrangement. (I couldn't tell what were seats and what was being sold.) The outdoor terrace is lovely. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Brooklyn is excellent! This is the nickname of the proprietor of this quirky café/Mile-End meeting place/resto/conference room/furniture store/art gallery. Brooklyn is many things to many people and she does them all so well. The croissant, chocolatine and espresso drinks (cortado/Gibraltar is my drink of choice) are all haute high quality as hot fuck! The croissant is buttery and the flakiest. This is Christian Fauré quality à la française. This is no Métro market crescent roll. Mmmm and such good coffee. All the lunch items are well made as well. I had a bibimbap (Korean veg rice bowl) and it was excellent. I sit here, read some book I brought along, stare at the passersby, wait for my leather jacket to be repaired next door, converse with the excellent people in front of me and eat and drink to my heart's content and look at all the cool vintage furniture they've got. Come here and eat and drink everything like me. Maybe even pick up an item or two to furnish your new apartment!?"}
{"text":"Un petit quatre étoiles seulement parce que je n'ai pas encore eu la chance de goûter à autre chose que leur muffins (qui était soit dit en passant dé-li-cieux!), ce petit café est à proximité de mon travail et avec le beau temps qui arrive, je compte bien retourner et tester plus de leurs produits!"}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest looking coffee shops I've ever been to. The first time I've visited this cafe, it was right after a fun session of bouldering next door.

Good : fresh pastries that will rock your socks off. I don't usually order treats with my latte, but the barista really hyped up the baked goods here so we decided to try some...and it did not disappoint! I love how half the cafe sells furniture, so you can browse while you wait for your order. Lots of sunlight, definitely a great spot for summer time. 

Bad: I came here once during lunch hours and it gets really really packed. Also, no wifi.

Bottom line : quirky little coffee shop with awesome baked goods. The service was friendly and quick, I'd recommend anyone to go there if they're exploring the mile end."}
{"text":"Life's unfairness is again proven by the fact that Brooklyn is only open 9-5. Nearby office workers are the envy of everyone. This spot is doing everything right. Food - delicious. Coffee - delicious. Staff - oh hello, you are delightful. Triple boom."}
{"text":"I like it here very much! Chill cafe with museum quality midcentury modern furniture and housewares for sale and a peaceful little deck out back. They also serve really nice breakfasts, lunches and baked goods. I wish they did a nice filter coffee service, pour over would be great or a fetco, since I prefer that to espresso myself, but we can't always get what we want. 

I really like the service here as well, friendly and kind and accommodating."}
{"text":"Really nice cafe / eatery on Saint-Viateur E. 

Great food as well as coffee. Patio space in the back. Very design-conscious interior with nice touches such a wooden bowls. Overall, a sophisticated, elegant vibe."}
{"text":"One of the stops on Montreal's Indie Coffee Passport, Brooklyn had the most disappointing latte of the bunch.  There are more than a few coffee places within a five-minute walk that I'd return to before trying their coffee again: Olimpico, Sardine, Myriade II, Falco. I hope they improve."}
{"text":"Café honnête, cuisine moyenne, pourtant la carte fait envie: ragoût mexicain, banh mi, bibimbap, egg sandwich... Dommage car avec du pain plus frais, une préparation plus juste ça serait top. 
Les serveurs sont pas bien réveillés, ils ont voulu débarrasser mon camarade au milieu du repas car ils ont confondu le fajitas dans son assiette avec sa serviette en papier, pensant qu'il avait fini :)
Sinon le cadre est chouettos, on y déjeune entouré de meubles modernistes en vente, avec la cuisine au centre."}
{"text":"What started off as a boutique specializing in 20th-century Modern furniture and collectibles, quickly morphed into a boutique/café that still specializes in 20th-century Modern furniture and collectibles.  And while Brooklyn's taste in furnishings is often impeccable, and the selection rotates rapidly, it's their intriguing and often tantalizing selection of breakfasts, lunches, and snacks that have made them a local hangout--all the more so since they added a lovely and secluded terrasse out back.  Don't judge the boutique/café by its name (I can hear you sneering through my screen, you self-proclaimed hipster-hunter you)--the name is actually a reference to the owner's longstanding sobriquet.  Instead, judge it on its friendly ambiance, its creative sandwiches (smoked trout and labneh with herbs, cukes, and greens, anyone?), and its definitive coffee cake, which is baked by the owner's auntie each and every day (!)."}
{"text":"Décidément un de mes cafés préférés à Montréal. J'y suis allée pour le petit-déjeuner : mon coup de coeur va au pain grillé servi avec labneh et confitures de figues et abricots... DÉ-LI-CIEUX ! Le décor est mignon, le personnel est sympathique. Ça vaut le détour !"}
{"text":"Well this is cool, a new café in the Mile End!  While that sentence may come off un peu sarcastique, I'm actually sincere.  The Mile End is pretty full of cafés, but cafés with decent espresso are few and far between if you ask me.  It seems as though this city didn't wake up to (or possibly remember) making decent espresso until about 2007 (i.e. when Myriade opened up akak 2008) so that amounts to a TON of coffee houses, as Montréal is a very coffeehouse culture-friendly city, with a shocking deficiency of places that manage to serve coffee that is decent.  Pour quelque raison it seems as though everybody wants to just chuck an espresso machine in their enterprise (Leonidas, Le Fin du Finyl, etc.)

Anyway, the coffee here is decent and not an arm and a leg like some other nearby coffee houses.  They have some nice looking little plates with delicate and artful presentation.  The service was nice and quick and the fizzy-water to go along with my cappuccino was a nice touch.

Lastly, it's also apparently a fancy furniture boutique?  This reminded me of the unfortunately short-lived Gilgamesh up on Beaubien in that there was all of this rad, comfortable looking furniture around...that you can't sit on.  Bummer.  In any case, the bar stool was comfy as could be and the furniture looked lovely.  Maybe this is meant to be a metaphor for living in Brooklyn?  The apartments look pretty and all, but you probably can't justify the cost.

I'll probably be back to try some of the food."}
{"text":"Cute cafe in the mile end! Great terrace spot out back and chairs set up out front as well. 

In my opinion, an overall solid choice, but not a mile end \"must go\" spot. 

No WiFi, so not a \"study\" cafe

Have been here a few times for lunch during the week. I love their artichoke sandwich. I have been disappointed by their meal of the day a few times. I would recommend sticking with one of their permanent menu choices. 

Definitely a bit on the pricier side, you can expect $11-$15 for mains at lunch. Lattes are around $5, but are in a smaller format than near by cafe neve."}
