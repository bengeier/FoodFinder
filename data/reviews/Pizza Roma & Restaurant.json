{"text":"Awesome wait staff open till 4am for everyday and so close to my house GREAT!!"}
{"text":"I've been several times.  Every neighbourhood should have a solid, cheap Italian family style restaurant.  This tries to be that, but the quality just isn't there.  If they would only use fresh ingredients and pay attention to detail this could be a half decent restaurant - but they don't so for me it isn't.  Service is mediocre - occassioanaly good, sometimes slow, and rarely considerate.  If you go stick to the pizza.  It's not bad."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this restaurant. Portion sizes are massive. Wine list is varied but not intimidating, special are great and the live music is never lame. Took my boyfriend's sister here for her 19th birthday and they gave her a free cocktail. This has become our go-to occasion restaurant. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Delivery killed the experience - it got to my family cold, one and half hours after we placed the ordered.  It was like eating left over pizza.  My wife had to put her slice in the oven to warm it up again.  I called them to discuss the cold pizza and then they left me on hold and didn't come back to pick-up.   Beware - order delivery at your own risk"}
{"text":"Unbeknownst to me, this sweet little neighborhood ristorante was featured on Restaurant Makeover.  I thought the place looked a little classier than I remembered it the last time I walked by!    Roma is pretty much the only affordable Italian place that I can think of short of heading southeast to Little Italy or northwest to Corso Italia.  I think Bloorcourt is so weirdly positioned between the two that no one else wanted to try.  I'm glad they did.  Part of its charm is also a flaw - it is a small, family-run restaurant.  So the food is handmade and thoughtfully prepared and the service is excellent, but you also have to be a little more patient when you eat there (or order delivery).  Because the staff is small, deliveries are a little longer than say, Pizza Pizza.  But it's totally worth it.  On the sad side, there have been times with friends when we wanted Roma but were just too hungry to wait and decided to go with something quicker, leaving Roma for another day.  Another unique feature of Roma is that it has what I am pretty certain is the only patio seating from Shaw Street all the way to Dufferin (actually, maybe even Lansdowne or beyond...).  As such, you can sit back with drinks and some delicious eats and enjoy a nice sunset on their west-facing patio.  It's pretty brilliant place to be on a summer's day.    If you order delivery, you can't go wrong with any of their gourmet pies -  or even just plain cheese - their pizza is really good.  Another great pick is their panzerotti, which, while not the absolute best in the city, is still pretty damn tasty.  Dining in, I would suggest any of their dinner salads (chicken, salmon, etc) which are truly enormous, or their classic dishes like the veal sandwich or the carbonara pasta.  Just be sure to order an appetizer right when you sit down, or bring a snack!  It's worth the wait, I promise."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for restaurants that offer decent, cheap eats and fast service. Roma fits this bill.  I went there a few weeks ago and enjoyed some tasty bruscetta and a chicken sandwich for only $13. I brought a group of friends there this past Friday and everyone was happy. I was initially told that we didn't need a reservation but when we arrived it was packed...something about a wedding reception in the back half. Fair Enough. I saw Roma featured on Restaurant Makeover and it appears to have chaged hands since but the food's still fairly good + the decor is really nice. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a few times and it's consistently good. The eggplant parmigiana, bruschetta and lasagna are excellent - and very reasonably priced. The service is very pleasant although it can be a little slow so don't come here for a quick lunch.  Enjoy the time or call in the order. This is our new favourite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"They tell me the food here used to be good...but then again, they tell me a lot of things.  I'm going to break tradition here and do a Pro/Con tilt on this place:  PRO  Open late Great live music - see listings Outdoor patio Good drink specials The Waitstaff  CON  THE FOOD  If Roma was a bar it would be a fine place to hang out enjoy summer evenings in the Blhetto (Bloor Ghetto).  Unfortunately, they insist on being called a restaurant and having eaten there several times - well I just can't let that slide.    Uninspiring, mundane Italian is the culinary slant here.  It's not offensive - it's just not good.  So-so pasta slathered with salsa generico and overcooked meat and poultry are edible - though you may nod off while doing so.  Anything from the sea ought to be avoided.  Let's just leave it at that.  Bottom line; If someone says \"Let's meet at Roma's\" say \"OK- Then where are we going to eat?\""}
{"text":"Ristorante Roma is sort of out of place on this strip of Bloor which is home to more \"mom and pop\" type dining options.  The updated decor, credited towards Restaurant Makeover, makes this quite the popular spot to hang out.  Other reasons include a large screen t.v. playing sports, and good food.  William T. and I met up with a few friends downtown.  We ordered a half litre of Chilean Riesling ($14), poutine, and a cappuccino.  Our friends ordered a Diet Coke (unlimited refills) and a Chicken & Mushroom Risotto.  The half-litre of Chilean Riesling seemed to last forever... 4 glasses later we were pretty satisfied, lol.  The \"poutine\" was interesting... Not traditional at all with the absence of cheese curds.  Instead, shredded cheese was used.  The thing that made me fall in love with this dish was the gravy... It was one of the most flavourful gravies I've ever had.  It had a smokey flavour to it that I can't quite put into words, but all you have to know is that it was good!  The cheese was not layered properly and therefore, you didn't get cheese in every bite, but that was easily remedied (although foodies may say destroyed) with the sprinkling of parmesan.    The risotto is a red-sauce based risotto and our dining companions were oohing and aahing about it.    The velvet seats were very comfortable, although some may find the absence of an arm rest to be bothersome.  The \"white\" leather seats they had could use some cleaning as they are showing signs of aging.  Our server was spectacular and really took my friend's \"keep them coming\" comment regarding his soft drink to heart.  Whenever his glass was empty it was promptly replaced without asking.  The cappuccino was quite good as well.  With tax and tip our bill came to $55.  Great prices, good food, and stellar service has made me a fan!"}
{"text":"Interesting little restarant on a street corner. Interior is well lit & uses light creamy color scheme.  Seats were very comfortable but the \"white\" leather seats they had could use a bleaching.  Sat down with my friends & ordered me some poutine & a half litre of Chilean Riesling a friend ordered a Chicken & Mushroom Risotto.  The poutine was topped with shredded cheese instead of curds, however it's saving grace was the gravy, oh so delicious congealment of lard & carbs.  The risotto was red-sauce based & was ok tasting overall.  Our server was attentive & kept the refills of water & softdrinks coming."}
{"text":"great Italian food especially the seafood risotto. I was told the kitchen is open till 4 am. planning on trying it around that time if i am near by one night."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of positives and negatives, and your timing and desires will have a lot to do with how you might feel about the place, but after having been here several times I have to say to say my feelings tend towards the negative.  As noted by others here, the patio is great, and I've seen some cool live acts here. The fact that it's open late is also a plus. To my recollection, the food I've had here has always been on the positive side of decent, if nothing to write home about; however, the consistent story here is the awful service. Things take forever or are forgotten. Despite having a Stella tap, the keg was dry and not replaced for over a month (at last check). Getting a bill from a server is a waste of time - just walk up to the bar when you're ready to leave.  If you're looking to chill on a patio, and in no rush, this place works. If you want somewhere more quiet to grab a drink and a snack late, and you're in no rush, this place works. If there is live music that interests you, and you're in no rush, this place works. Outside of those situations (and coming into fall, the first situation ceases to be relevant), you probably wanna give this joint a pass.  My 2 cents."}
{"text":"Went to Ristorante Roma without realizing it was featured on Restaurant Makeover.  Needless to say I had my doubts knowing what that show hasn't done for businesses.    I'll give RM credit; they did a fantastic job on the interior decor with the chic modern upscale look.  In fact, this restaurant kind of looks out of place in this neighborhood.   We ordered a rack of lamb with a raspberry lemon sauce, potatoes and various veggies.  Very delicious, lamb cooked to perfection and potatoes were roasted crisp enough to make it close to a French fry.    The pizza was an absolute delightful surprise.  We ordered a small but the size was closer to a medium pizza in most joints.  The dough has a nice flaky texture to it; the sauce was a perfect balance of sweet and tangy.   Well done!  Would definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"The best part about Ristorante Roma is that they are open till 4am, like all of the time. Other than that their Italian food is alright. Great when your loaded at 3am and nothing else is open, and it's also a 5 min walk from my house.    Menu do's: pizza, and veal/chicken sandwiches Menu dont's: ceasar salad, steak  Notable Mention: strippers hang out after their shifts from the local gentleman's clubs, so if you like hitting on strippers at 3am, put your cat clothes on and head to Ristorante Roma!"}
