{"text":"Do yourself a favor and visit this place! We ordered online through postmates tonight and if was so yummy! The bread that the cevap comes on is amazing, all the different meats were great (we got the mixed platter,) and the spinach and cheese burek was delicious. The sopska salad looked so simple, but the dressing that was on it was fresh and bright, making it one of the better salads I've ever had! So glad we finally gave this place a try and you should too!"}
{"text":"Wow - stop everything you're doing and go to this place right now.  Here is what you should order:

1.) cevapi (chay-VOP-ee) with ajvar (eye-var) and kajmak (ok, I forgot how to pronounce this one).  The cevapi is 10 small sausages on homemade bread.  The ajvar is some tasty little tomato/vegetable mix and the kajmak is kind of like cream cheese but better.  OUT of this WORLD!  
2.) eggplant napoleon - this was one of the yummiest things ever - mozzarella cheese on top of the homemade bread with eggplant and tomato bursting with flavor.  3.) roasted vegetables - i'm tired of explaining everything, just take my word for it.

We also got cockta (i guess it's a Bosnian coke - average).  Should have tried the Turkish tea.  Oh well, next time.  All this food, and it was a lot, was about $23.  Tremendous value!  And the family that own/operate the place were the nicest.  we checked out the Bosnian market which is connected to the restaurant and which they also own.  We picked up some interesting things.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is the first 5-Star review I've given, and if you eat here I can almost guarantee you'll leave singing the Gospel of Cevap. 

Like the other reviewers said, try the cevapi. It will have you planning your next visit before you're finished. 

Right next door is a grocery store where you can but some frozen versions of the dishes, but you really can't beat having it cooked to order. 

Their 'To-Go' menu alone is better than most places I've been to. While ticket times may be less than desirable, it is so, so worth it. 

Go here."}
{"text":"Cevapi. Everyone has to try them and will get a need to come back here every week. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely wonderful.  Everything they gave us was absolutely amazing.  The Bosnian Coffee was fantastic and completely unlike any coffee I have ever had...and it wasn't just the taste, it was the whole presentation/experience.  The food was delicious and the family who runs the place are very kind (and helpful when we struggled to pronounce the names of the food). 

Definitely go visit this place.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Authentic Balkan food at a family owned cafe/market.  Chevaps are great, but do yourself a favor and get the combo plate (#9) that includes Sudzukice (spicy sausage)!  Good people, good food, it's clean, and they started serving beer this month.  What more do you need?"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good reviews of this place so I decided to try it out this morning. Came in around 11 am and it wasn't too busy. There was ample space to park in the back. I did try going in through the front and the door was locked, but a really nice customer got up from her seat and signaled me to go through the back instead.

Coming in from the back, you enter the grocery section. I didn't have time to explore (next time!), but it seems like they stock a variety of European products. To the left and down the stairs is the restaurant itself. A little small; I imagine it'd be packed during lunch or dinner, but I kind of liked that it wasn't too busy this morning... It felt like a nice getaway from the traffic just outside. Whenever I finished my meal, more people started trickling in, so I'm thankful I was able to get in at a relatively peaceful time.

As for the food, I ordered the small cevaps. I thought it wouldn't be enough, but I found it really filling! The ajvar and kajmak (so creamy, my favorite!) that came with it were really nice. The flatbread was so warm, soft and light, a little crunchy at the right parts. 

I also ordered the Bosnian coffee and it came so beautifully served on a tray, with two sugar cubes and a small sample of Turkish delight. Honestly, if I lived closer, I would come here just for the coffee and Turkish delight. So good!

My meal came to just under $10 (small cevaps, Bosnian coffee, and tap water which is free [versus the bottled water which is not], also including a small tip). Not bad at all, especially for a student counting her pennies. The owner--and I'm assuming, his son (who served me and taught me how to properly drink Bosnian coffee, thank you!)--were so kind. 

Great food, kind people, I'll try to be back again soon. =)"}
{"text":"Awesome! My husband picked up lunch for us and while he waited, they served him a coffee. I had the Cevaps and spicy sausage combo and the husband had the meat lovers. Everything was great and the bread was amazing -- homemade deliciousness. Next time I want to try the barek. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"This was our first time having Bosnian food, and it was amazing!!  If I could give it more stars I would!  The owner/cook is super friendly and the food is amazing!!!  Entrees are easily large enough to split but we were starving and ate our own. The place is clean, the food is well cooked and soooo tasty, will come here again and again."}
{"text":"Incredible food and an absolute bargain.  So authentic that you feel as if you walked into an old world, Eastern European market.  Cevapi is really delicious and as others have said, enjoy the sauces that are available.  The owner is very nice and obviously a very hard worker.  Be sure to check out the market too and try something new."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible place. A true gem on Central Avenue! Opened in February and I hope it stays open a long time. 

We walked in through the store, filled with a decent variety of Bosnian and Turkish imports. Delightful! The seating is limited but it wasn't very busy. We had the Cevapi, Bosnian sausage, which was seared to perfection. The Bosnian coffee was excellent, served in traditionally on a silver plate with sugar. To top it off, the owners are just the nicest, most accommodating people. It was a joy to eat here and we'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Euro Grill & Café in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood of Charlotte. 

With an eclectic menu, you will find various Mediterranean, German, and Bosnian dishes. This is a small restaurant, only five tables, so you may have to wait. Dora here. Actually, the entire time we were there, every table was occupied, and people lined up. Don't wait until you're starving to go. Speaking from experience. :)

Only two people worked both the back and the front, and they were slammed. I must've looked about ready to pass out from hunger because they very graciously offered us a complimentary Sopska (a Greek salad) due to the delay on our meal. 

Delicious, colorful, and some of the best Feta cheese I've ever tasted. Yum! I'd definitely order this again. We were both digging deep for the last few blocks of cheese. :)

When visiting a new restaurant with food from countries that I am not familiar with, I always like to try a variety of options. So I chose the Mjesano Meso. This Meat Lovers Medley included three pieces of skinless sausage (Cevapi), one thin burger (pljeskavica), one chicken kebab (raznjici), and one piece of spicy sausage, (sudzukice), all served on house-made Bosnian flatbread. 

This was truly a sampling of the entire menu. The cevapi reminded me of breakfast sausage, and the pljeskavica would pass for an American hamburger. The chicken raznjici was tender and the sudzukice was great. But the star of this dish was the Bosnian flatbread. Soft and fluffy, I think I could have made a whole meal off just the bread. 

Dora here. That flatbread rocks! So light and fluffy! And the kebab chicken was so tender. But I'm glad I ordered the Beef Burek. Filo stuffed with minced beef, it was tasty, light, and so delicate I had to check to make sure I was eating beef. I ate almost the entire burek, but didn't have that heavy, bloated feeling.

If you're hoping for ambiance or privacy, this isn't the restaurant. But you might be surprised at this tiny spot. Unusual dishes, large portions, and great prices. How can you go wrong?

We would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.

{"text":"I really was not very impressed here at all. We actually stumbled upon this place in some online listing as I haven't heard many people talking about it elsewhere.

In general the venue didn't seem very well kept. The same owners manage the grocery store next to it so I imagine they are torn between the two spots at times. When I visited there was a table covered in food that looked to have been sitting there for a while and nobody in site to clean it up. It took some time for the one person who was working to come out, tidy up a bit and wait on us. In general wouldn't have been a problem with just one other person staffed. I suppose this is to be expected in a small space but could have made a better first impression if it were addressed.

For the food, it could just be that this particular cuisine isn't my style, I'm willing to admit that. The cevapi was suggested because it was a specialty so I went with that. Again, I'm willing to admit it might just be a preference of mine but this dish really wasn't very appealing. Back to the staffing issue, it took a while for our food to come out and when it did, I wasn't impressed by the presentation, how greasy it was and how limited the options on my plate were to break up the greasy meat and greasy  bread it was served on. 

Unfortunately, I really can't see myself going back as I prefer cuisine with a bit more variety. I will say however that the meat pastries on the menu looked pretty good as well. If I were to head back, I'd give one of those a try."}
{"text":"Tiny little place you'd never think to stop in. The owner is there and he and the other staff were lovely. The eggplant stack was heaven. Everything we got was on point. Can't wait to go back. Loved everything about it!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Euro Grill and we loved it. No frills place that appeared to be run by a father and son. We shared a Sopska salad then I had the Meat Medley combo and my wife had the meat pie. Everything was delicious. The authentic Bosnian market next door is a must to if you're going to try your hand cooking Bosnian food at home."}
{"text":"I was craving Indian food, but they were closed, so we ventured down Central. I am so glad we did! We had never eaten Bosnian food, but will become regulars. We tried different dishes and tried from each other....everything was wonderful. The owner is nice and even gave me a chocolate bar for Mother's Day. 
I didn't even notice how small the space is after a little while...not for large groups...so worth it.
What a wonderful time."}
{"text":"I only tasted cevaps for the second time in my life here. And out of the two experiences, this was by far the better one! Food was freshly prepared, albeit not \"fresh\" in the sense of having anything vegetable-y in it. This is a place to go when you're ready for a hearty, somewhat greasy and meat-heavy meal. Menu choices are simple and not extensive - but it's usually better to do a few things right rather than to do a lot badly. It's a fun experience, and the owners were very friendly and helpful. I'd happily recommend this place to anyone who wants to give their taste buds a new experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place. New in Charlotte, and I am happy we went there. Tiny place with great food, the owner treated us as a friend and family. Will love to go back there again."}
{"text":"The owner is a very nice guy and extremely friendly always joking around.  The ladies in the kitchen are also very sweet.  The food is very good and the atmosphere is also very nice and relaxed.  Plus the bosna market is also very nice to pick up the hard to find european treats."}
{"text":"We heard many good things about this place and we decided to stop by for some
Inegol kofta (that's what they are called in turkey) \"cevapi\" and it was amazing! It's huge and full of flavor. The bread is sooooo tasty and the meat amazing :) the place is very small but cozy, great for lunch :)"}
{"text":"The best. I've got a lot of Eastern European friends who's parents make this food religiously. Going to become a regular here. The meat medley is the best value"}
{"text":"Euro Grill & Cafe is a wonderful little restaurant with amazing food and service. Cevapi and pleskavica were amazing food choice. Overall, a great place with great service, and excellent food. I will highly recommend this little hidden restaurant to anyone who likes taste of Balkan Food from Bosnia!!!"}
{"text":"5 small round tables with 2-4 chairs at each. If you lived in Charlotte about 5 years ago, you'd remember a Vietnamese bubble tea business...this place took its place and left the decor.

It's bright, lime green. Friendly service. Good food. If you are hungry for some meat, this is the place. Definitely a meat and potatoes place and perfect for those winter months or days when  you are feeling extra hungry.

There is a clean, well-stocked Bosnian grocery store next door. Pick up some cookies, chocolate spread, and other treats on your way out."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Went here with my mother. Definitely a bit of a hole-in-the-wall. If you're awkward like me it may take a moment to get used to the atmosphere. I got there and there were several couples who obviously knew each other speaking in Turkish (?) across the table. There was a friendly vibe. I definitely recommend the cevipis, the meat platter, and the Turkish coffee. All delicious. They came with two sauces, a red pepper and a creamy white sauce. If you're interested, there are also some foreign sodas, several made using rose hips. On the other side of the restaurant is a lovely market, with all sorts of European cheeses, meats, and preserved products at really great prices. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Really fantastic, authentic, Bosnian food. If you try it, you will fall in love. I haven't had this authentic of cevape since I was last in Sarajevo. Absolutely perfect. The zeljanica was also fantastic. 
Can't say enough good things about this place but so glad I was passing through Charlotte and made the stop. The owner is also a super sweet guy. I am happy to recommend this place and hope to be able to come back."}
{"text":"I tried this place out after reading Thomas' review below, \"stop everything you're doing and go to this place right now.\" I am really good at following directions when it comes to food!

I love to try new cuisines and had never eaten anything Bosnian or from that region at all, so I was really excited to try this out. I got everything to go since I was late for work already, and the food took about 20 min. to prepare. A man, who I'm guessing was the owner, was there all by himself today cooking, waiting tables, bussing tables, and working the register at the market next door. After about 5 minutes of waiting, he brought me out a salad on the house for me to eat while I waited. This was unnecessary, but extremely nice of him and I devoured the delicious salad. Before I left, I asked him what kind of cheese he put in my salad and ended up buying two pounds of it! The cheese is Krinos brand, Bulgarian White Cheese and is very similar to feta, but milder and not as dry. 

Walking to my car I was positive of 3 things: I was going to burn the crap outa my fingers, I was going to spill on my work clothes before even getting to work, and I was going to start eating before taking pictures, I was ok with all of that!

I ate most of the Zeljanica (Spinach pie) on the way to work and it was absolutely delicious! The pastry was flaky and crunchy on the outside and the dough had a bite to it on the inside. The spinach filling was delicious and reminded me of something my grandparents (French and Hungarian) used to make when I was little. I cut up some of the cheese I bought and ate it along with this spinach pie and I was in heaven. The Burek, or meat pie was just as good. I believe the actual pastry was the same, it was just filled with meat instead of spinach. It was delicious and I dressed it with a bright red vegetable sauce the guy gave me along with my food. If had some spicy mustard I definitely would've put some on the Burek, I think that would've complimented it really well.

The last thing I tried was the Cevapi. It is a Bosnian flat bread that they split open like a pita. It had 5 skinless sausages in it, it's just ground beef which they shape into sausages, and it came with some raw onions on the side. The whole thing was great, but the bread was outa this world and now I think most sandwiches should be make with it! After a little research I found out it's called Lepinja, it's kind of like a fluffy pita/Ciabatta/Fry bread combination and it was delicious! I found a couple of recipes online but next time I'm in there I will ask if he sells the bread on its own so I can make all sorts of sandwiches with it!

This place is great and the prices are very reasonable. Each of the pies was $4.50 and one would be enough for a lunch on its own. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other specialties and definitely some Turkish coffee!"}
{"text":"The owner is so kind and friendly. He said all the food (including the delicious bread) is made in house. I had the cevaps with sausage, and spinach pie. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent Bosnian food with wonderful flavor. Non pretentious place for a lovely Bosnian home cooked style meal. Hidden gem that my girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by. Definitively a repeat casual meal place to go. Plus they had Manchester united vs Tottenham showing on TV."}
{"text":"First comes LOVE then comes Sudzukice similar to Cevapi... With Sudzukice comes long skinny spicy Sausages... Cevapi is shorter sausages... Both served with or on thin bread usually joined by Onions!  

Bosnian Cuisine!  OF COURSE I took Photos!  What!

Burek one of my Favorite foods - Beautiful and Yummy with a Special Cabbage  Zalad!  Bosnian comfort Food!  Meat, Potato, onion and spices wrapped in dough and baked!  Fantastik!

Sirnica, Zeljanica, Pljeskavica, Schnitzels, Kabobs and Gyro, also on the menu!

To get ready for the Real Dessert I had a slice of Tiramisu, though plenty of food I consider this the Appetizer for the Real Dessert!

Turkish Coffee for Dessert and a lesson in how to enjoy Turkish Coffee I had never heard... If you hear this education information please message me and let me know what you know!!!

Small enough inside that you would want to sit outside if the weather is nice... Seriously about 15 seats if you are good friends, five tables with only room for four of them!

Dude!  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This ethnic market/restaurant is a little dive, but in a nice way. The restaurant side is a hole in the wall, with only five tables, spotless and as far away as possible from Charlotte's ubiquitous strip mall spaces were you eat while staring at a depressing parking lot. 

The owner (I think) hovers over you eager to please but the food was slow to come out of the kitchen. Well worth the wait to me because it's delicious if you like peasant food from the Balkans with a heavy Turkish influence - which I do!- and very cheap too.  Turns out thanks to the Ottoman Empire's influence Bosnian cuisine closely resembles the Romanian cooking I'm so familiar with.  

I love the cevaps (spiced ground beef) with the home made bread, sirnica (cheese pie made from Bulgarian feta) , the eggplant dish. To finish a slice of better than usual tiramisu was only 95 cents and the Turkish coffee was served with a little cube of Rahat Lokum. 

Cheap dive, tasty, fun... not recommended for chain restaurant lemmings."}
{"text":"I love trying places like the Euro Grill & Cafe.

I didn't know the first thing about Bosnian food going in, or any Balkan cuisine for that matter.  But I'm not sure the Euro Grill & Cafe broadened my knowledge to any significant degree because the menu actually features few purely Bosnian items.  Instead, it's sort of a catch-all cafe, offering schnitzels, burgers, gyros, and even a Philly Cheesesteak.  

There is a focus on cevaps, though.  That item consists of excellent kofte-like sausages served on a roll or flatbread similar to focaccia, but softer and oilier, along with housemade sour cream, a flavorful roasted-veggie spread (mostly red bell peppers?), and diced onions as condiments.  Overall, delicious.  Served in combo plate with fries that weren't especially noteworthy but that made for a huge amount of food for nine bucks.

There's also a sopska salad, which is much like a Greek salad but without the kalamata olives.  It comes in a huge serving that could probably satisfy a table of four as an accompaniment to other entrees.

The business consists of a tiny cafe with just three or four tables, plus a small market selling mostly Eastern European items in the back.  The lone fella operating the cafe and store on a quiet Friday evening (we were the sole diners eating there, although several take-out orders went out during our stay) was very warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Very authentic and delicious food. The Cevapi are great and the lepinja was just right."}
{"text":"By far, this is one of the best places to eat in Charlotte! Great, inexpensive food! Among the overwhelming number of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and fast food places, Euro Grill & Café is welcome new and refreshing addition to the Charlotte's restaurant scene. I am not going to bore the reader with repeating explanations and correct pronunciation of some menu items from previous comments. All I am going to say, if you haven't tried \"cevapi\" yet, you don't know what have you been missing. This shouldn't be just another drive through place for a quick lunch, which it can be if you're in a hurry. But I suggest that you make your first visit to Euro Grill & Café into an experience. Whatever you try on the menu, you can't go wrong. It is most likely different than what you can find anywhere else in Charlotte. My suggestion is that you should definitely start your first visit with \"cevapi\" sandwich, which by the way, you don't just pick up and eat like any ordinary sandwich. You simply break off the small pieces of that delicious home made bread \"lepinja\" and make your own bite size mini sandwiches. To get the true experience, aroma and the best flavor out of each bite, on each piece of bread you should spread the layer of \"ajvar\", \"kajmak\" and diced onions as a base, and top it off with \"cevap\". Each bite just melts in your mouth. Once your entire sandwich is all gone, and it won't take too long, you should end it all with some traditional \"Baklava\" dessert and a true Turkish coffee. Baklava and coffee in itself is an experience which you shouldn't start the day without. Once you try the food there, it will keep you coming back for more and more...Oh, by the way, while you there, make sure you also stop at the store as well and pick up some delicious and unique items that you won't find in your local grocery store."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short but definitely sweet. We come out here all the way from Fayetteville and love it every time. The food here is very authentic and my Bosnian wife even loves it!! It's so good that every time we eat here I forget to take a picture to share because I just want eat everything up! Definitely should come check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Such yummy food! I sent my bf on a solo mission to pick stuff up there cuz I was flying into Charlotte late one night. We got the burek and a cevapi sandwich both of which were sooooo good!  I had wanted to try the eggplant napoleon  too (being that I have a slightly abnormal need for eggplant at all times) but they were out :(
We will definitely be going back!! .... Not juuuust for the eggplant ;)"}
{"text":"So I have to say I never would have come to Euro Cafe and grill... and even when I was going I missed it on Central. Nondescript, I've probably passed it a hundred times. 

A Bosnian friend invited be there for lunch. The place is a bodega/restaurant with at most four tables. The owner is super friendly and was excited to see new people try out their menu. I have to say it was pretty authentic, they make their own cevaps (beef sausage) and that was my favorite. The prices are affordable and the service is pretty good!

I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I just had the most fantastic dinner here. The owner was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were all family. The food is VERY good!!  I will be back again really soon for sure!!"}
{"text":"We tried the Euro Grill for the first time and LOVED it.  Amazing cevapi, bread unlike any I have had before, and great sauces.  The menu also has a large variety of items to choose from, so there are plenty of options for all people. The service is friendly, and it feels warm and welcoming.  We'll be returning ASAP."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for awhile now. I finally got a chance to visit today for lunch. The same building used to be a Vietnamese restaurant. The inside hasn't changed a whole lot since then. They've added a bunch of little round mirrors, but that's about it. I ordered the combo cevaps sandwich.  Super simple sandwich - spongy bread, sausage, red pepper sauce, onions, and some kind of cheese. It tastes so much better than it sounds. It was pretty great. I can't wait to try other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"It's family own and ran and they had Bosnian TV playing which was cool. The inside was quaint. I had never had Bosnian before and it was delicious. I had the Bosnian coffee which was good and the chicken kabob which was excellent, but my husband had the cevap and it was amazing. I already want to go back for another one. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"What a great find here in the deep south...Is this Charlotte or a little nook of Chicago, or quite simply Bosnia. This is a little house-front restaurant and market. Filled with delicious old world treats. I am half Serbian and Half Italian, believe me when I say that my Yugoslavian half was very happy today. I assume that the owner and the five other people in the restaurant were Bosnian. There was a lively Bosnian Soccer game on the TV...They were all cheering--but in between the owner was making my daughter and myself the Old World Specialties...Cevapi, with Ajvar and the chopped Salad with the White Cheese ( a thousand times better than feta) , The Sudzkice a long skinny sausage and a chicken kabob all served with a sour cream and fresh onions. The grilled flavor was terrific. Its a tiny place but the food is mighty, I will definetley go back and try the Burek and the Schnitzel. I went into the market after and purchased some of the Hot Ajvar and the Kajmak ( a cream cheese and butter mixture) to spread on bread. If you haven't tried it you should...they are very friendly and warm people....GO BOSNIA!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. This is the closest I have come to eating truly great Bosnian traditional food. Every time we are in the area we always stop and eat. It's the best. And the owner is absolutely awesome and friendly."}
{"text":"Delightful. Small, clean, unassuming cafe with charming service. Trust the reviews and get the cevapi. The bread is warm and chewy, the sausage is moist and flavorful, and the cheese and red pepper sauce served with it puts it over the top. I can't stop thinking about it. We also had a super-fresh salad with chopped veggies, feta (I think), and a tasty vinaigrette. The spinach and cheese burek was deliciously flaky and the Vienna schnitzel was simple and not in the least bit chewy (as I've experienced with other schnitzel dishes). The chef was also our server, and he explained the dishes while joking with us throughout the meal. There's a small grocery store attached to the restaurant that had a slew of European chocolates and candies available (they had plenty of other items, like pastas, jams, etc but I couldn't get past the chocolate). We will definitely be back. It's a little gem of a spot."}
{"text":"Don't be dissuaded by the small cafe, or stoic service. This place is authentic Bosnian food at a great price!
I recommend the cevaps, a beef sausage and homemade flat bread dish. It's more than what I could eat! 
The schnitzel looks good and my friend said it tasted even better! 
A small Eastern European market is collocated and offers up some Mediterranean fare that the well-traveled individual would recognize.
It's also reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a whim and it was fantastic! Pricing was very reasonable for the amount you get. Bosnian coffee was wonderful, burek was great as well as the cevaps! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I am scared for this little gem of a place because I went during lunch today and it was empty! It makes me sad to see places like fast food chains or even my beloved Panera filled to max capacity but yet little mom and pop places like this remain empty. Do not be intimidated by the menu or the fact that it's not your typical American dishes, this food is approachable and tasty!

I consulted yelp prior to my visit and knew I had to give the Cevapi a try. While they look like sausage links they certainly do not taste like sausage! If anything it is very similar to Gyro beef/lamp mixture in a link form. The bread it is served on is simply outstanding. This is served plain with onions & tomato or with two sauce options ajvar, which is kind of similar to blended roasted red peppers and/or kajmak which the server referred to as sour cream (and it tasted identically). Anyway, both taste great. If you want an average sized lunch (and very filling at that) go with the smaller version...trust me, it is plenty. 

We also decided to split the ground beef burek - it was good but didn't compare to the cevapi in my opinion. It was served with a side of pickled cabbage & carrots. Our server recommended putting the \"sour cream\" on it as well. 

We ended the meal with two cups of Turkish coffee. Well as it turns out I do not like Turkish coffee very much. I can't fault the restaurant for this at all...I am usually one who skips the sugar but doubles the cream - so this was too stout. I will say if you're a strong coffee lover Turkish coffee is a must. 


The atmosphere is quiet but seating inside is limited and a bit cramped. This is also connected to a Bosnian grocery store as well. The service is friendly -though distant,  but all in all I was fine with everything.

It is VERY reasonably priced for lunch - everything I describe came to $14 and I left food on my plate at the end of my meal. 

I'll be back to get dessert!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Had the small cevapi, and it was plenty of tasty food for me, with strong coffee.  I definitely plan on coming back.  It's Bosnian, not Turkish, but yelp has no appropriate category.

Coming from down/uptown/the west, I had my eyes peeled towards the strip malls (this is Charlotte, after all), but Euro Grill & Cafe is in a light cream-colored house with indigo awnings right up close to the sidewalk.  It's on a corner, and there's parking in back."}
{"text":"I've been in the building before, when it was (something... they had bubble tea?), and truth be told, it has not changed much. Perhaps the pictures, as they are now of Eastern Europe, rather than (the far east, perhaps?). It's still rather small, with maybe 5 small tables, a couple of chairs at each. It isn't much. If you want more room, get your food to go, or take it into the attached grocery store (actually, not sure if you are allowed to do that). You could also eat in the parking lot out back - but that probably isn't encouraged either.

The real star here is the cevapi - think spicy sausages that look like breakfast sausage links (not all that common in the south - we eat patties), arranged on a large, somewhat spongy bun-like thing. It's not unlike Ethiopian bread, but it does appear to have been cooked a bit more. And they put stuff in it, notably a red pepper sauce, which you can buy in jars in the attached grocery if you like it. It's good, but could use a bit more spice, so it's up to you.

They also serve a chicken kabob sandwich, which is not bad, but somewhat dangerous, as they leave the kabob - a wooden skewer - in the meat, within the sandwich, making it a bit of a challenge to get out. And it's horizontal through the meat, not vertical to keep things together. Consider yourself warned.

With all that in mind, the food is solid, the service is off the hook friendly. Go for the food, stay for the service. Fala!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the Cevaps every time that I have come here with the fresh bread and sides of roasted pepper puree and creamy cheese. The side salad is awesome also .. everything combined is just perfect !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The food is phenomenal! And the owner and staff treat you like family. Eating here is always such a wonderful experience!
I highly recommend the cevape!"}

{"text":"A few months ago we got some delicious cevaps from the farmers market so we've been talking about going here to try the ones at Euro Cafe. 

It was reasonably priced and tasty! I got the small cevaps and my boyfriend got the combo. We both really liked it! It was fresh and made to order. The only thing that would've made it better for me would be if the cevaps were a little crispier on the outside but I can just request that next time. The service was great and the whole market / cafe combination reminded me of my time in Europe and Turkey. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We just love this little spot.  Five tables are perfect for a nice meal.  Awesome coffee.  Great meat pies and cevaps!   Everything is awesome!  I don't give 5 stars lightly.  If you want a taste of Bosnia in an authentic setting, this can't be beat.  And then you can go shopping in the market next store!"}
{"text":"Gah I ADORE this place. It has everything I love, excellent food, a kind of food that NOONE else is doing in town, family owned, a friendly family at that, and it's super close to my house.
The gentlemen owner always looks so cheery and has given me free kinder on occasion to thank me for my business. Ive tried a lot of things from here, but I do tend to revert back to my usual. So let me offer these recommendations...

What to get: 
The spicy bosnian sausage- 5 spiced (not really spicy) sausages on some of the best bread you with ever eat this side of the pond. I actually prefer this to the cevapi (cue debate)
Cevapi- is it a meatball? is it a sausage? who cares it is delish. Comes on the same delectable bread
The \"Combo\" mix of the top 2...this is how I fell in love with the spicy sausage
The white and red sauces- bosnian sour cream and roasted red pepper condiment respectively...necessities for the above choices. Try the spicy version of the red.
The side salad- romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, onions, FETA, the perfect balancing side act to the inevitable meat and bread goodness you will be so happily shoveling into your mouth hole

What to avoid: The only thing that I didn't LOVE here was the eggplant napoleon, just didn't do much for me 

I hope this place stays here for a reeeeeeaaaally long time"}
{"text":"I had the Bosnian burger/pjeskavica it was amazing. Cooked perfectly and had an awesome authentic taste. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"FOOD was great. Services was great. Coffee sucked but it wasn't American coffee. Cute sodas from their country. Fries were amazing! Staff was very kind to us. Cute lil place. Only about 5 tables. And food didn't take long to come out."}
