{"text":"Their sate beef noodle soup is there signature dish.  The spring rolls are good too.  It's a small place and family ran.  We like it here and the service is reliable.   It's one of our fav places for Vietnamese.  I think they been at this location for over 10 years so that's gotta mean something."}
{"text":"I enjoy most of the food at Trong Khanh. I go there mainly because I crave their homemade garlic chili oil. I put heaping portions of this ground chili and garlic mixture over everything that I order. It's the best flavour! The store bought stuff in a jar doesn't even come close (and I've tried many brands).  Ok.. back to the food... I enjoy their cambodian noodle soup with the glass noodles. As well I enjoy their satay beef noodle soup. It's one of the better ones I've had around town. It's got a nutty flavour which I really like. Their charbroiled meat and spring rolls on vermicelli with the \"nuoc cham\" sauce is pretty decent.  My only real complaint is their deep-fried spring rolls. They are actually quite disgusting to be honest. Because they didn't add any vegetables or vermicelli to the spring roll mixture, it's just all meat.. so it tasted like deep-fried sausage... and it's definitely not a texture that I care for... To be honest, I don't remember the spring rolls being like this a couple of years ago.. but this recent time I went, I just don't know what happened.. And I know it's not just my bad luck.. because I read about their spring rolls in a foodie forum as well and someone else was also complaining about it tasting like deep-fried sausage.  I'd still go back to this place cuz I crave their garlic chili mixture...  It's more like.. \"Can I have some noodle soup with my chili oil, please?!?\" That's how much I like their chili oil...   But I definitely stay away from the spring rolls."}
{"text":"I discovered this place when I first moved into the area about 10-12 years ago. I found it to be one of the first of its kinds in Calgary, having been established in 1989.  Their deep fried spring rolls with an ample supply of broad basil for dipping together into fish sauce were totally killer... for several years. And then something horrible happened... they turned bad. Never did find out what happened, new chef or the like ? Nevertheless, they are back to being almost as excellent as I first remembered them. I still frequent the joint about once every few months for a nice bowl of beef satay or seafood pho. They have one of the best satay's around and yes, without a doubt, their chili sauce/oil is fabulous. They are obviously a tight little family run unit, and I have observed the women in the front going through several pregnancies each through the years and the growth of their children. I love places like this. Ones that are surviving on solid family involvement, straightforward and reproducible good quality food and a faithful following of clientele. If you haven't tried strip mall, family-owned, Vietnamese before, then start here. You won't be disappointed and you will quickly find your 'regular' and keep coming back."}
{"text":"Love Trong Khanh. I have been coming here for years for the best deepfried spring rolls outside of Saigon and a really good bowl of non-traditional pho sate (they add cream/coconut milk)."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pho sate in the city. It has tomatoes in it! The broth is thicker than elsewhere, and much tastier. It's just full of everything good.  Unfortunately they are closed for renovations indefinitely, as of Sept 2014. Open soon!!"}
{"text":"I have a problem. When I visit Vietnamese restaurants, I order the same thing. Every time. I don't know why, but I can't order anything but BBQ/grilled beef with spring rolls in a rice vermicelli bowl. And I can eat it everyday for a week and not get tired of it.  I love Trong Khanh. It is a short walk from my house, so I can order my beloved rice vermicelli bowl for takeout at home and walk over, and by the time I get there, my order is ready.  The beef is always tasty and super flavourful, and the spring rolls are amazing! I think they are made with rice paper rather than the standard pastry wrap. And oh, the fish sauce. So good. I could use a little more veggie in my bowl though, the ratio of veg to vermicelli is a little off. Overall, this place is great. Service is prompt and the employees are nice."}
