{"text":"Food was very good and I would have rated it 4stars but service was very poor. The waitresses are green and they seemed very disorganized.  They need to step up their game or I can't see how this business can grow. Saturday night and only 8 guests is a bad sign.  I will give them another chance in a few months and hopefully they can get some top notch servers."}
{"text":"My husband and I travel a lot and eat in many different restaurants so we're used to a lot.  I'm not usually one to complain but in this case, I had to.  It was NOT a good night for us at all and I felt like I just had to share our experience with others.  We were looking forward to an evening out and we thought we had found a nice little place but as soon as we were seated the evening went downhill!!! The owner was SO RUDE.  Like, uncomfortably rude.  The food portions very small, very salty and the prices are so expensive for what comes on your plate-not in a fine dining way but in a cheap, owner trying to make a huge profit kind of way. Drink prices were ridiculously high and there were added charges to our bill for things we didn't even order and when we asked to have them removed, they refused!  There were not enough parking spaces in the lot because it is shared with a grocery store and library and a few other small businesses.  The bathrooms were dirty, which I'm really hoping is not a reflection of what the kitchen may look like. The room atmosphere is ok but you're going to pay a huge bill to be treated terribly to sit in a room with some just ok ambiance and not much else.  We ended up speaking to friends who had also gone and had a similar experience.  Many other way better restaurants in the area.  Don't bother AT ALL."}
{"text":"Had a party of 50 people there. The owner Eli (who goes by Elio) ended up grossly overcharging us at the end of the night (charging almost double the price per drink that he originally stipulated) and under supplying food he promised during all the meetings prior to event. Two guests are gluten-free and vegan and told him that 30 days in advance. He promised to accommodate, yet during the pasta course service, he told us he didn't end up getting gluten free pasta. So we paid full 3-course price for one stuffed zucchini and half a tomato, no other courses. The place sits right above a grocery store. Eli also promised full platters of pulled pork sliders and other hors d'ouvres to be served during cocktail hour. He ended up providing 4 small and very scarce charcuterie boards suitable for 2 people and still charged us full price for each.  After all the guests left, he stood behind the bar making rude comments to us while my family tore down and packed up our own party. No staff helped. He kept saying things like, \"This was supposed to only be 4 hours. People don't do this.\" We were there for five and a half hours. The signage states it's an event centre. He didn't once mention time constraints or write up a contract regarding time.   Strongly advise you all never to host a function there. This guy has no clue how to host an elegant event or deal with people."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant, amazing food, very friendly owners & beautiful atmosphere!  Book your valentines date February 14th while space is available"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday salsa night with S2S. The dance floor is quite small but there's enough  room for everyone. The bartenders are really good. The atmosphere is very friendly and we had a great time! The only challenge is finding parking as the plaza has limited number of spots on a busy nice like this. Cover charge is $10/per person on 'event' nights. It includes a free dance lesson in the beginning. Didn't try the food yet, will review when we do."}
{"text":"Superb Lebanese Saturday night party with fine singer and DJ!! Food was great and friendly service. The sound was a bit too much though!! But, who cares  we were dancing all the time."}
{"text":"We attended last night for a friend's 50th birthday.  This place was a huge disappointment to say the least.   We did have reservations and were a party of 10.  Imagine our surprise when on a Saturday evening the place was empty.  The server was friendly and seated us at our reserved table.  As we sat we were informed there was no Salmon or Sausages available on the menu.   Then later as we ordered wine we were advised that half of the menu selections were unavailable and only the higher end, most expensive wines were in stock. The appetizers were tasty, although the polenta fries were served without the dip that was described on the menu.   As the night progressed the server's attitude declined.  Perhaps she was frustrated.  The entrees arrived in staggered fashion; 2 plates emerged and then 15 mins later the next 4. I think you get the picture.  My order was vegetarian pizza.  It was the last to arrive, when everyone else was done.  I did not eat it in the restaurant and took it to go.  I did have it for lunch the next day and it tasted delicious. The highlight? The food was tasty - when they had it in stock. The lowlight? The management and staff didn't seem to understand that they were supposed to to \"serve\" patrons.Spend your precious time and money elsewhere, where you are valued."}
{"text":"I was at La Veranda today with my husband and toddler. Great food and service. We dined on the patio. The server was very personable and accommodating. The high chair for my son was one of the nicest restaurant high chairs I've ever seen (might not be relevant, I know. Lol)  Food portions were pretty big and the taste was good. Everything was prepared fresh.  I like that the owner even made his way out to personally meet and greet us.  The restaurant is newly renovated and very clean.  Oh, back to the food, they start you off with warm mini ciabatta rolls. We had fried ravioli, cheese rolls to start. Main course was the fritti misto (fried shrimps and calamari) and dessert was tiramisu in a jar.  The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because although the food was good, it was very traditional, and personally, I need something innovative to really impress me.  However, I enjoyed my experience a lot and my husband and I will definitely be returning."}
