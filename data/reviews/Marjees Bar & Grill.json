{"text":"This place blew me away! It's very chill, relaxing, and fun with great music, pool, and people that are genuine, very friendly and welcoming.  Lisa is one of the best bartenders and flies around the bar accommodating everybody.  She also makes it a point to get to know you, talk with you, and is hilarious.. very down to earth. On top of great priced drinks, and friendly people, the food is off the chain! The wings with the honey mustard sauce is amazing and the fish is hands down the best I've ever had. It's fresh, crispy, and the batter is perfect! The portions will definitely fill you up, I can never finish it.  Marjee, the owner, is amazing. She cooks, talks to the customers, and enjoys what she does! Give this place a chance, you will love the people, food, drinks, and overall vibe!"}
{"text":"I recently started working at E-prep cliffs and on a lunch break I seen the signs and decided to check it out when I walked I was greeted  by the owner marjee and Lisa the best bartender in town in my eyes. While i was looking at the menu Marjee asked me if I like fish i said yes I love fish. She told me to try a piece of her fish, I tasted it and I was hooked I've been going back ever since. The fish is not the only thing i go for but i do highly recommend that you try it, I go back because for people I just let they were so nice to me, I walk in there and feel like family and I seen that other people that walk threw that door they treat the same they are genuinely good people. I go there now for the amazing food, great atmosphere and to see Lisa, Marjee and the amazing cook Ricky who will have you laughing all night they all will honestly. I went in there today and was told they have Uber eats so now I can order delivery and enjoy there food in the comfort of my home. They have defiantly made me a loyal customer to there establishment."}

This is a super chill bar with a laid back patrons. The drinks are inexpensive and the bar keeps are super friendly. My friend had a kettle one and my self a fine bottle of Miller light. Bill was under 7$. Marjee was rocking some great reggae. Great place."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on the recommendation of Yelp for chicken wings as I was craving them. This establishment was on a corner and as soon as you walk in, it was an old style bar. I was immediately greeted by a cheerful lady whom I told I was here to kill time waiting to pick my gf up from the airport so I needed some delicious food. She told me about the chicken wings and also recommended the burger as it was a popular item.   I ordered the lemon pepper wings and a bacon cheese burger. The cook had to make the burger patties by hand which impressed me. When a burger is made and shaped by hand, you know it's made out of love. The wings and burger came out in small paper containers which didn't bother me. Easy pick up and throw away. The wings were crispy and had a delicious butter warm taste to it. The lemon pepper seasoning was just right. The burger was phenomenal. The aside of the burger and bun was just right. The taste combined with the lettuce tomato and bacon was out of this world. The company that was there which were locals was fun and enjoyable. I would definitely come back here for laughs and the food that was cooked here. Places like this are rare."}
{"text":"I liked this place the second I walked in, it looked and felt like the old-time bars my dad used to take me to in the middle 1960s when we lived over on the southside.  Unfortunately, on this visit I was not able to stay and enjoy the ambience as I had simply called in an order for a couple of dozen wings.  Lisa took my order, which was for one dozen mango habanero and a dozen barbecue sauce. She suggested I try the Habenero with some honey mustard added to the sauce, and she was absolutely correct in terms of creating both the unique and slightly creamy taste.  The wings were big, meaty, and not drowning in sauce but perfectly coated.  I'm certainly hoping I have the opportunity to come back here and try some of the rest of the menu, as the wings were a wonderful way to get introduced to the skills of the kitchen."}
