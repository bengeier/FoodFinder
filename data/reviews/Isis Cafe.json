{"text":"Isis is such a unique addition to Pittsburgh, let alone Brookline. It has to be one of the only Egyptian restaurants in the city and the quality of food is great. Unfortunately, it looks a little less than it is due to the fact that it is in the former produce store and is plagued with the old awning. Please take this place seriously if you choose to experience some of their food, as they mean business when it comes to their cuisine. 

Also, take a moment and talk to the family that is running the business. They are putting everything they have into it and I really admire them. 

The food is excellent! I had the tasting menu and sampled a little bit of everything. There wasn't much that i didn't like, and the things that weren't my favorite was solely because it's something I would normally not enjoy, but I was happy to try them anyways. They are open later in the evenings now and also serve brunch, which I will be making a point to try in the very near future. FYI, they are BYOB, too!"}
{"text":"This little gem of a place deserves tobe successful. Give it a try. Menu is interesting and great for the vegetarian in your life as well. Falafel was the best I've ever had. Yogurt w/dill was scrumptious. Homemade mano smoothie was excellent too. Nicest people you'll ever want to patronize. They were VERY thankful for your business. Decor could use a woman's touch but overall I loved it. Try this place out before everyone else does...!"}
{"text":"Agh!  I'm so torn on this one.

Absolutely one of the more unique places to eat in Pittsburgh.  BYOB with no corkage, extremely friendly staff/ownership, eclectic mix-match of furniture and fixtures, very reasonable food prices (read ~$20 for an app and two entrees) and definitely an extremely laid back atmosphere.

The owners are fantastic and are eager to share their traditions with you, including pronunciation of the menu items, cultural norms (i.e. not providing the check prior to a guest asking for it), etc.  They also were obviously eager and excited to have new customers come in.

Where Isis fell short on expectations was the food itself.  While the menu has a great mix of options (small plates, sandwiches, and more traditional entrees), nothing really stood out in our meal.  Not to say it was bad (I'll definitely be going back), but I wasn't left with that insatiable feeling of wanting more once I was done."}
{"text":"I am sorry to have to do this to this family owned place, but our experience was so lack luster, I just had to share.  Food pricing is reasonable, the menu is not very exceptional.  Everythinf was salty, and garlic filled.  I expect garlic, I just don't expect it to be the only thing I taste.  The salad that came with the meal made my husband gag from how much vinegar was in it, and I love vinegar. I couldn't even handle it.  I ordered the eggplant and peppers. It was all peppers swimming in oil with a side of rice.  My husband ordered the chicken marinated in yogurt and orange sauce.  His came and was a piece of chicken on a dish, didn't taste like anything at all, just grilled chicken.  The big kicker was as the waiter brought our food out of the kitchen, he took it into another room, and reheated both plates in the microwave, you could hear it beeping.   Awful."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, LOVED Isis Cafe. It's a great new restaurant on Brookline Boulevard. I had Bat bel Assal whuch is duck with a honey sauce, rice, and veggies, and I thought it was to die for. I also recommend the Samboosa (ground meat in a flaky pastry), Zabadi bel Kheyar (like a cucumber salad with pita), and the desserts: Belila and Basboussa. The former is like rice pudding, the latter is like a coconut cake or macaroon. Also perfect was the lemon orzo soup and the house salad. The hibiscus tea was refreshing. The service was great! What a wonderful family-run business! The mother is the main cook!

They need to take down the Brookline Produce sign if they haven't already."}
{"text":"A friend and I dined here this past Tuesday. We were there for a \"Moon\" celebration, but wished to try the food out while we where there. The d√©cor is eclectic, but gives you a bit of a homey feeling. I tried three different appetizers. One was the fried cauliflower which was fantastic! I also tried the falafel , which was good and came with a dipping sauce that to me had a small bite to it, although my friend said she did not notice that. I also had the ground meat in Filo, which were delightful little pastries. The Fenugreek tea was awesome, and they made sure we didn't run out. My friend had a chicken dish which I sampled. This was delightful, and the plate made a beautiful presentation, what with the very green fresh broccoli, red peppers, and the seared chicken. It tasted pretty darn good too! If your adventurous, definitely try this place out, but don't go there expecting to see American Items on the menu. This is strictly a place for a very different type of cuisine in the Burgh! One I was very happy to try out, and was very happy I did. The service is a little spotty, but there was a large party in the other room, and then a party of four came into the dining room where we were. I commend these folks for their brave and adventurous undertaking. Brookline needs good places to go to , and this is definitely one of them. I will go back . I must mention also the music. I loved it. It was not too loud as in some places, but was very soothing. I did ask if they had a cd or where the music came from, and the very polite young man told me it was coming from his phone. I would have bought a cd of the music were it available. All in all a very enjoyable night out, that didn't cost an arm and a leg. I almost forgot, if you are a vegetarian they have many dishes which would suit you just fine!"}
{"text":"A few Sundays ago, the lady and I partook in a brunch for just $6.50 a head that included the frittata-ish Eggar, hummus, baba ganoush, the intensely flavorful fava bean dip known as foul medames, a tangy, fruity tomato-laden vita cheese dip, a worthy example of falafel, and for dessert, a fruit salad/ice cream sundae hybrid called Fakhfakhina that won palates and stomachs like the greatest of diplomats would hearts and minds. All of it was washed down once more with that magically refreshing elixir referred to as Karkady.

Everything was seasoned to a capital T, and we heard no microwaves beeping."}
{"text":"Enjoyable.  The atmosphere is a little different with some couches and a sitting area to go along with tables.  Entrance is thru a black door not the glass door. Two areas once inside.  A few tables in the entrance area and the larger area with the couches and some more tables.

Had the Bamia which is okra with a tomato sauce and Egyptian spices.  A side salad with a nice oil dressing came with the meal.   Service was very friendly but somewhat disjointed."}
