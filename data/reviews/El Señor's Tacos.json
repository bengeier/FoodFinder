{"text":"This is the best authentic Mexican in Cleveland. Hands down, there is nothing that comes close. It is the standard to which I compare all other Mexican food. I can't get enough of their chorizo, and I always leave with some from the grocery store so I can cook it at home later in the week. The pastor is another favorite of mine, and every sauce on the table is outstanding...great flavor, great heat.   It's totally casual and there are only a couple places to sit, so it doesn't have fancy atmosphere going for it, but it doesn't need it. El Señor is the best, and the grocery store, La Mexicana, which it is tucked inside of, is great too!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Seating is limited, but we have always lucked out and found a seat before our food was finished. I lived in AZ for 9 years - the food here compares to some of my favorite Mexican food in the SW.  I'll hold off on eating here for a while - I noticed too much eating by the kitchen help during my recent visit. A lady actually took a piece of tough meat out of her mouth with her vinyl glove on, and then returned to work! A little too relaxed.  Very good food, I'll check in at a future date..."}
{"text":"I'm here to tell you the Lengua is perrrrfect!! Such great food! No joke! We ordered burritos to go because we're traveling back to New York where it has been difficult, to say the least, to find good mexican food. We have managed though THANKS TO THE YELP APP!!  Yelp has not failed us once and El Senors is another testimony! Will go back anyday!!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT AUTHENTIC Mexican food! The horchata is the best I've ever had...and I lived in Chula, Vista, CA. Wish my Spanish was a little better...horchata is pink, \"rosa\", would love recipe! Burritos and tacos are wonderful and very inexpensive. You can find poblamo peppers in the grocery store. They have tamales on weekends--we bought quite a few for a potluck and everyone enjoyed them. Will be driving out to Painesville often this summer!"}
{"text":"Oh my! My husband and I went here not expecting much. Who would ever think going to La Mexicana market and El Señor  Tacos would make you feel like you're on vacation! The market had everything from prickly pear cactus to pan dulce (sweet bread), full butcher services with such things as beef tongue, exotic spices and Mexican cookware. We got an enchilada and taco to go (just to test the food). We got a pizza 1 block down the road as our real meal. Guess what? Never ate the pizza - El Señor 's food was absolutely delicious! I don't think I'll have much trouble convincing my husband to go \"on vacation\" again next week!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Mexican food. The burritos are our favorite, and they are very filling.  You definitely get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Fantastic little gem buried in the corner of a Mexican grocery store. I grew up in San Diego and lived in Southern AZ for years and this place is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Very good food! Can be a bit difficult to communicate an order with the language barrier."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I friggin love this place. I saw it was voted bets authentic burrito in Cleveland sometime back which may or may not be true, but they sure are authentic. Meaning, you're paying extra for sour cream guac and anything other than rice beans light-lettuce and meat of your choosing. If it's good enough for the Mexicans and Guatemalans around town then dammit it's goo enough for me. Definitely not Chipotle, which I also love, but the best place in Lake County for sure. Plus, you can get some good ol' Jarritos and Flan, man!! And do a little shopping at La Mexicana whiel you're at it."}
{"text":"As a Painesville native who lives in Columbus, I always come to this restaurant when I'm in town. This is the best authentic Mexican food I have had! I highly recommend making the trip into beautiful downtown Painesville to check out El Señor's, as well as La Mexicana, the attached grocery store complete with an amazing bakery and unique Mexican products you can't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"As a native of L.A. transplanted to Cleveland, this place is a dream -- good food, as everyone said. My only beef is with the woman behind the counter -- she was friendly with all the mexicans, but outwardly hostile to me, a gringa. I had to ask her a few times for things, and no matter how much I smiled and joked with her, I got the hard unfriendly stare. I went by myself and really wanted to enjoy it, but her attitude made it hard. Señor, you need a friendlier face behind the counter! I obviously will continue to come back, the food is so genuine. BTW, this is more mexican \"border\" food --  very hot and spicy, even the guacamole."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken burrito. Restaurant is inside the Mexican grocery store. Order at the register have a seat and enjoy. Next time we will get it to go and take it home.  It's very small in there."}
{"text":"The service is so so and line cook was kind of rude. I purchased two beef burritos and only received one salsa. I asked for another and he said .75 for another. After 5 minutes of sign language and pointing he finally realized there was only one. I think he knew all along, but tried to upcharge me. The prices do seem a bit high for quality of food. The food tasted decent but not great. The meat could have used more seasoning. The cheese melted on the inside was a nice touch. Overall a average experience..."}
{"text":"Looking for the real deal.  This is it.  Authentic food right in front of a Mexican market.  You don't have to speak Spanish but it might help.  The tacos were great.  We have been looking for real Mexican food for some time in Cleveland and finally found a place.  The place is not much to look at but if there is room have a seat try the salsa and hot sauce and enjoy a Mexican soft drink.  Muy bueno!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about these \"life changing\" burritos for years.  Maybe it's just an unfortunate case of over-hype, but they didn't live up to my expectations.  I had the pastor burrito and thought it was fine, but I've definitely had better, especially when it comes to the craftsmanship (that thing didn't stand a chance of staying wrapped).  My husband had a chicken burrito and said it was literally the worst burrito he's ever had in his life (dry and flavorless), but take that with a grain of salt because he ate it about 5 hours after it was purchased.  The food I had was nothing special, but I still might give this place another shot."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Mexican food in California and this place is the real deal taqueria; that's hard to find anywhere but near the border.  The market is awesome as well, lots of very hard to find items for those who like making authentic food.  The tacos are delicious.  The burrito unfortunately they grill and don't wrap in foil so it's not as easy to eat.  The pork with \"green chili\" is proper spicy and a good pick for those with capsaicin addictions.  The pastor is the best I've ever had, it has little bits of pineapple occasionally in it and is perfectly spiced.  Plus the table and the bar seating have 3 salsas to choose, onion, cilantro, and limes.  They could really make a fortune if they expanded the size of the dining area somehow."}
{"text":"I got a steak torta tonight.. and it was the best torta I've ever had, hands down. Will be there again in the near future.. $3.25, delicious and FILLING. So happy I finally found this place!"}
{"text":"This place delivers again, and again and again. I have never had a bad meal here. Ever. FANTASTIC Mexican food!   You want real, honest-to-god authentic tacos, or quesadillas or burritos, served with a bevy of scrumptious salsas - not tomato sauces passed up for salsa in the US in general.... then go this this place! $6 bucks will get you a ginormous burrito stuffed with a rice, peppers, cheese and your choice of variations of beef, pork, etc. My personal favourite is a 50-50 mix of their Huevos con Salsa (eggs) and beans. Delicious!  Definitely a place worth going to... heck! I drive out here from Cleveland just to get a taco often!"}
{"text":"Am I still in Ohio?!? This little taqueria tucked in the front corner of a Mexican grocery store is the real McCoy. I lived for years in the El Paso, Texas area and spent much of my time across the Rio Grande in  \"extremely safe and tranquil\" Ciudad Juárez, México consuming tacos, gringas, quesadillas, and flautas in simple but delicious places much like this one. I recommend trying quesadillas with nopales (cactus) and tacos de buche (pork stomach) or something with lengua (beef tongue). AnywAys I suspect anything here is freakin' good! Painesville has a very large Mexican immigrant population to which this establishment caters. There are various salsas and cilantro and superhot roasted chilis available in little plastic containers to garnish your food with, typical for such roadside stand type places in México. There are some very modest bar stool seating arrangements inside and a couple plastic tables outside. The setting is , well, primitive, but the food is great. There is a lady next door on the side walk making Mexican style fruit shakes/icies that are pretty good to accompany your food with. When I discovered Painesville, I felt temporarily removed from the agonizing sameness of Middle America and brought to quesadilla de nopal y buche bliss!  I might give this place like 4 or 4.5 stars for the food but since this is in the middle of nowhere in Ohio it wins an extra star for existing!! Definitely worth going out of your way for, because \"Ohio Mexican food\" is easily explained by the fact that most \"Mexican\" restaurants in Ohio serve \"chimichangas\" and \"hard shelled tacos\"!"}
{"text":"Thought at first it was a bad day for the restaurant. But twice this happened. Almost never will they ever acknowledge you even when no one is being served. They will continue to do paperwork and check the counters etc. Walked out the second time this happened. If you want to beg them to take your order for which you pay for, go right ahead. And the other reason I decided to get back to my car is - I saw the cook pouring loads of oil like water, hmmmmmm - don't take my order I need to wait and wait and wait patiently, and ruin my health with loads of grease for which I pay for. Not gonna happen!!"}
{"text":"COMPLETE INSANITY! Best Tacos on the East Coast. Quesadillas are as good as they get. This place has no flaws. Take me to your leader."}
{"text":"So if you're in the area and love Mexican food, YOU MUST stop here!  This little gen is one of the best kept secrets in the area!  The food is made fresh in front of you, fresh cilantro, lime, onions, and about 6 homemade sauces!  The spice is perfect and the portions of street tacos are amazing!  There is also a really cool Mexican grocery store attached to the shop where you can get all of the ingredients to recreate your fiesta at your casa :-)"}
{"text":"It was delicious. But wen I read the most popular reviews no one mentioned it's in a market. Fold out chairs / tables. Little to no space to eat: IN A grocery store. Nothing wrong with this, food is authentic & great but something to know for sure.   Burrito was for sure the winner of the night. But it was all fantastic and as everyone says the prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"Some of the best taco's I've had outside of the west coast and I'm Mexican so I know this. They even have taco's de lengua"}
{"text":"Stopped in here to get some tacos after the place I usually go to was raided by Immigration. Sad too see them go but hell if you sneak in your a criminal and need to get deported. Any the folks are very nice here and they make very good tacos. It's interesting that there in a Mexican grocery store and liquor store."}
{"text":"These guys serve the most fresh, delicious quesadilla I have ever had  ( not including the ones I ate in Mexico ) Their burritos are huge and so good. Everything here is the real deal... We love being so close to this place. It is awesome!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican. I had a chorizo burrito I won't soon forget. If you are in Painesville don't miss this place."}
{"text":"El Señor's is inside La Mexicana grocery store, the flagship business of Painesville's Mexican community. Delicious authentic food. Bustling community center. Warm, compassionate owners. This place is the real deal!   My favorites are the tacos al pastor and the flan and arroz con leche in the fridge. Don't miss them! Also, try the old school glass bottle coke. It's made with real sugar.  Another tip is that they bake fresh pan dulce (conchas, etc) on site every morning.  And while you're waiting for your order, wander around the grocery store and explore!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place today for lunch. I have to say at first we walked in and looked around the store it is very nice in there. Saw a lot of pastry and bread nice little butcher area. Are for fresh looking produce. Then we made our way to the little food area. Nice little set up. I felt bad for the lady who was taking what looked to be refried bean to the back of the kitchen she spilt some. My only complaint and I guess I can't complain really as it is a mexican place but the menu is very over whelming for how small it is in regards to figuring out what is what. there is some english translation how ever not well enough. I was not sure what came with what or how this all worked the lady who took my order only knew broken english but was very nice and had a smile. I got a chicken burrito and a chorizo taco as well as a flan. I only paid $10 not bad for all the food i had i mean this burrito was HUGE. Then guy who was a cook was very nice and make the food well. The burrito was a little soggy i'm assuming from the liquid from the chicken but i was ok with it. I will go back for sure and try some other things. I did see some chichirones (sp) i've always wanted to try them. I'm going to give this place 4 stars but I feel after i've had a few other things I'm sure i will bump it to a 5. If your in the area try it!"}
{"text":"An amazing find! The food is amazing and the staff was so adorable and helpful. And even take the time to go through the attached grocery store too."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is from California and has had many authentic Mexican restaurants' food. Her favorite cuisine is Mexican and she could eat carne asada everyday. When she moved here, we tried a few other places that she thought were decent, but then one day we tried Señor's. We've been there more times than I could count. I love that it's fresh food and you can watch them cook it right in front of you. They've got the best burritos in town and their tacos are very good with the salsa verde. I was never a huge Mexican food fan, but Señor's has changed me for good."}
{"text":"This place is bad, service is lousy the lady taking your order looks like she is mad all the time which really affects your stay there, and last time I was there she keep wiping her nose really gross. Flavor of food is standard fare nothing outstanding here it is really overpriced for a place like this, it is packed I bet due to the fact it is the only place you can get tacos around here but don't be fooled into believing the hype it is not good and your wallet will feel it specially if you have a big entourage go some place else you will thank me."}
{"text":"Awesome hole in the wall spot. Just like someone else said, it's taco truck style in a stationary building. Pretty inexpensive, too!"}
{"text":"Thems the real deal. Real tacos made by real Mexicans. This is a litttle slice of Guadalajara right in Painesvile. If your with in 10 miles of this joint it is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Delicious! Kids loved the steak tacos. Definitely worth the drive. Chorizo burrito was tasty and huge - I couldn't come close to finishing."}
{"text":"Oh wow! We came here on YELP reviews. This was a really small facility in a very small grocery store. What a find. We got there around 11:40. The lady pointed us to the menu. We looked and ordered. I ordered a bean and lengua burrito and my wife ordered a lengua and a steak taco. We sat down at the only table. 4 seater. They also had 2 counters, one with 4-5 stools and the other, I think, had 2 stools. After a few minutes the lady brought our food out. I was expecting refried beans in my burrito. It had white whole beans with the lengua. It was really good and it was pretty big. The lady also brought out a variety of salsas and cilantro. Wife's tacos were the soft tacos. They were also very good. Around noon all the locals started to come in. It got really busy. Oh yeah, there was a couple of tables outside. We would definitely  return."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic style Mexican street food. The lengua tacos are perfect, the chorizo burrito wasn't too greasy. Unfortunately they were out of pork during my visit. It is definitely the best place in northeast Ohio for this food."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced, execellent tacos and burritos, all prepared fresh when you order.  At one of the very few tables near to the counter you will find an assortment of truly amazing condiments, like limes, onions and various incredible, fresh sauces to add to your meal.  Grab a squeeze bottle and get adventurous!  Imagine a popular CA/CO taco stand that only has 3 tables.  That the same here.  It's busy and popular because the food is excellent, not because they want you to stay and eat!  Lots of to-go orders here.  Therefore, the indoor seating is very sparse, dismal and uncomfortable, tho I can't comment about the outdoor seating.  I recommend ordering to-go or planning to vie for the limited seating.  The grocery store that is under the same roof is easily the best Latin grocer in the tri-county area, by far.  If you like La Plaza market in Lakewood, then you will love this little gem in Painesville.  Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"This is not a trendy restaurant. It is an authentic Mexican taco/burrito joint tucked in a little grocery near downtown painesville. The clientele was almost entirely Spanish speaking.  The chorizo and pork belly tacos were amazing and I washed it down with a nice cold coke from a glass bottle. I filled up for about $7.  The eating area was kind of dirty, but the food was good enough that I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I only wish I had known about this place sooner! AH-MAZING!!! I only vary from my usual beef burrito by getting double meat. It's really unnecessary as the burritos are large as is. If you want to not eat for the next 24 hours though, the double meat is a challenge to finish. I love the beans and rice with cheese melted into the tortilla.   My wife orders tongue tacos and has gotten a quesadilla before. Corn tortillas and guacamole made to order. No complaints other than my wife says chorizo is a bit too salty, but i find it salty where ever I purchase chorizo.   Add a Jarritos Jamaica or bottle of coke with real sugar and you are set."}
{"text":"As good as it gets around here. Not sure what region of Mexico this cooking is based on, but I trust it to be authentic. It's certainly not Oaxacan but that's the only place I've been. Some Mexican food loving relatives came to town for the weekend so the whole fam went here Friday evening for supper. Luckily it wasn't crowded when we arrived. Once us gringo's decided on our meals we placed our order and the food started rolling out fairly quickly. They make their own tortillas which is awesome(get the corn[maize] not flour). We got all variety of tacos and quesadillas. The tables are full of containers of salsas, chopped onion, cilantro, and lime wedges. Which is the way it should be.   Only legitimate complaint could be about the price. It is a bit more expensive than other taco trucks/joints I've been to in Denver or L.A. They're usually around $1.25/each while they are $1.75 here. However, you get 2 tortillas under the pile of meat so really you can make 2 tacos out of one order. The quesadilla is bigger, has cheese and is $3.75. If you're looking for value though, the burrito is the way to go. The one my dad got was bigger than Chipotle and only $5.25.  Yes it can be intimidating and awkward to walk in to an all mexican establishment and feel like a dumb outsider. But don't worry about it, the order taker will know enough english to help you order and they'll be glad to take your money and give you some yummy food in return. So be brave, ignore the feeling of eyes staring at you and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the drive from Cleveland Heights. I don't know of any other place where I can go to get authentic tacos. The tongue and pork stomach tacos are consistently amazing, the quesadillas are delicious, and the burritos are enormous."}
{"text":"Tacos (and burritos and quesadillas) at a great price.  I've decided that I would rather drive 40 minutes to get tacos here than drive 5 minutes to go to my nearest Chipotle.  The restaurant is a small attachment to a medium sized Mexican supermarket.  There aren't a lot of tables, so either come with a small group of friends or be prepared to eat your food somewhere else.  The corn tortillas were tasty and fresh.  Also, the meat in the tacos was extremely well seasoned.  I tried the beef steak taco, the chorizo taco, and the pork stomach taco.  Out of these three, the chorizo taco was my favorite.  There is a huge assortment of salsas and chopped onions that are available on the table.  One salsa is a salsa verde and then there are several other red salsas.  I thought the salsas had a lot of flavor, but I wish that they were a little spicier.   As to price, you get a bargain here.  One of the few times I've looked at my receipt in a restaurant and was surprised that I was paying less than I expected."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! I got a burrito with chorizo and wow! This is some great authentic food. I'm so happy! More review coming later!"}
{"text":"Most authentic Mexican I've had in NE Ohio.  Rivals  what I've had down in Houston,  Texas.  It's street/truck style,  so don't expect much seating or any changes to cater to the northern pallet (tons of cheese, iceberg lettuce,  tomato,  etc.) Just good ol' cilantro, onion, and lime! Get some conchas (the sweet shell shaped dessert bread)  in the store after to finish your meal!"}
{"text":"A great hole-in-the-wall little mexican diner. You would never find this place unless you were specifically looking for it.  A little hard to order if you dont' speak Spanish, but the menu is in both English and Spanish so you can make it through okay.  Grilled corn tortillas for all my orders were flavorful and tastey (if a bit oily). My pork and green chile soft taco was very good, and definitely spicy.  My burrito was a monster, huge thing topped with a mound of refried beans. It was delicious and filling in a way that chipotle isn't. The salsa was hot and spicy, the cheese was definitely authentic and I really enjoyed the seasong of the bistek."}
{"text":"This is my favorite stop when I'm craving delicious Mexican food.  The pastor is my favorite, my husband always gets the chorizo, and the kids either get the steak or chicken.  The lengua is great.   On the weekends you can buy pozole, tonight's special was rojo.  In the summer my daughter always gets the horchata.   We usually shop in the market while our food is cooking, picking up essentials for cooking at home."}
{"text":"Very small restaurant inside a Mexican grocery store. One table and a few stools at a counter. I got a chicken burrito and it was phenomenal. A variety of sauces available on the table. They were ok, just didn't seem very sanitary that way. But that wouldn't stop me from going there again. Next time I will get my food to go."}
{"text":"Wey good and authentic tacos, The best around the area  O love very far from this place and yet is worth the 30 mile drive. Try the asada and buche tacos  Also they have like four or five different types of salsa  All very good"}
{"text":"Food is very good and I'm from southern Calif. where mexican food is real ! The only problem I have is they don't or won't understand english and it is really hard to order or to understand them. Also they are not friendly to gringos."}
{"text":"Inside Ohio's greatest, and perhaps only, Mexican grocery store (La Mexicana Grocery ) is this little magical Mexican taco shop. It's lined with 2 counters with bar stools and 1 table (Don't freight, there's also 3 patio tables outside the shop).  It's the epiphany of a taqueria, a bella senorita taking the order, and a greasy papacita dominating the grill -- and i love it! They make these little magical tacos that brings me back to tacos from Tuscon AZ. Its simply taco truck style-- prepared meat of choice with cilantro and onions. Varies salsas (tomatillo, hot, and habanero sauces) are strategically placed on the counters and table. We had the lengua taco and also tried the carne asada quesadilla. Both were yummies in our tummies!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious...unbelievably cheap.  These are the best tacos I have eaten outside of New Mexico.  Nothing fancy and could almost be called a hole in the wall but well worth the trip.  I really can't come up with all the expletives that fully address how good I think their food is.  I am telling you...I am begging you...please go there and spread the good word. I had heard of this place through a couple of newspaper articles and was determined to get there.  My wife, who has spent time in Mexico and knows authentic Mexican food, were like children at Christmas trying to eat them in the front seat of my van. As good as the tacos were, the sauces they included and a ball of cilantro and onions wrapped in aluminum foil, were killer. This was one of the few times in my life that the taste, quality and price exceeded my expectations by miles.  Whoever runs this place...please don't screw it up with any changes...you have done everything right."}
{"text":"It only took one bite of a Chorizo Taco from El Señor's for me to understand why so many people are addicted to this place.  It's become almost a weekly ritual to travel to Downtown Painesville for some tacos or maybe even a Beef Torta (washed down by a Jarritos soda of course!)   If you're feeling adventurous I'd highly recommend trying the beef tongue, it's all the great taste of beef you've come to expect, but in a super tender form.  The best part about all this is the price.  You'll get a fantastic meal for an even better price, you can easily get full for under $10.  2 Tortas, a plate of mexican rice, and a Jarritos soda will only set you back about $9 (I'm a big guy and I was stuffed after all of that).  You could spend just as much for a combo meal at fast food anymore that's nowhere near the quality."}
{"text":"My new addiction. Went with my fiancé Sunday for a quick bite after our Easter ride and man was I taken back. Everything in the store/deli was authentic. There was a bit of a language barrier but nothing to overwhelming. Menus were easy to read. We ordered the Chicken Burrito. I had originally ordered one for each of us and was glad for the miscommunication. The burrito was so big and delicious we both took half and couldn't finish it. This one gets two thumbs up ! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really don't know anything about anything but I love these delicious simple tacos. I have tried several tacos and they have the salsa and they are so good. and a good price. Try this place!"}
