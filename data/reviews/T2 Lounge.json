{"text":"Garbage place. Overrated and sleezy. Thursday night - why did I even bother... Oh ya, it's in my neighborhood and I needed a study break. If you're bored, broke, and don't feel like heading downtown, then by all means stop by. It's passable but not worth the effort in going here."}
{"text":"We had a birthday party here for one of our friends and it was just great.  The music at the beginning was live and fun and then we went outside to the patio where they had a dj playng some dance music with Lounge areas to hang out.  The food was great and service too."}
{"text":"PLEASE save your time and money do not go to this restaurant it is absolutely horrible.The food was dry and barely warm.Not only that,it was sooooooooo noisy because there was 2 other parties taking place at the same time I could barely make out what my friend was saying right next to me.Service was slow,not enough servers and way too many guests.First and last time going there!"}
{"text":"I don't know who paid the other Yelp users to give this place such high ratings, but I don't believe it for a second. And for the \"users\" who are probably (a) the owner (b) the manager, if you're going to write a fake Yelp review, don't be too overly enthusiastic because that is a dead giveaway.   First, the location is too far away from civilization. My main grievance, though, is that the food is ridiculously overpriced for (a) the portion and (b) the quality. I ordered the papperadelle, and I believe it was around $18, which is quite standard for pasta. But when I got the plate, I already knew I would be disappointed. It came in a long appetizer dish, and i got maybe 10 individual noodles...to say that I got ripped off is the understatement of the century.   People who come here and actually enjoy themselves are probably the sheltered Woodbridge crowd, because all you have to do is drive 30 minutes south to Toronto and get WAY better food and legitimate portions.   For the record I was forced to come here against my will, for a bachelorette party. Never again, T2, NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Hey Vaughan, did you know about this little spot called T2. Oh no? Well you should because it is amazing!  Last night I finally got up off the couch and drove down to T2 on the recommendation of my younger, party-crazy brother. For months he'd been telling me about how great a party spot this place was AND how awesome it was inside. OK, so last night when I could work no more and felt I deserved a drink and a little dance, I arrived at T2 for their \"Sound of Thursdays\" night and not only was it amazing but word has certainly spread because in the dead of winter this place was anything but that - they were packed!  The decor here is gorgeous and versatile as it is able to work as a restaurant and a lounge (hence the name restaurant and lounge). Mirrors of different sizes adorn the walls, chandeliers hang from the 20-30 foot ceilings and the bar and it's staff are gorgeous (it's Woodbridge so it's kind of a given that the staff would be gorgeous).  Recall earlier when I mentioned the \"little spot\" called T2? Well I was lying because for a place in the suburbs this place is huge! On par or better than many downtown Toronto night time establishments. Not only do they have a sizable main floor and apparent semi private dining area/dance floor, there is an extensive patio, which as I'm told wraps around the building and is the true highlight of this spot.   Tons of room to lounge, dance, drink... oh yes and did I mention by day they are a fine dining establishment? While I didn't have an opportunity to sample their wares (which I plan on doing - this place is a date spot extraordinaire) I viewed their menu and nearly died. Such a delicious assortment of treats for the mouth I truly hope they taste as delicious as they sound.   I'm thoroughly impressed by this place and I look forward to partying it up here in the future but look even more forward to returning for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I needed a quiet and nice looking place in Vaughan for drinks with a date. This place was gorgeous and she was impressed. Customer service was incredible, doing what they could to please us. Most of the decore was pristine, with a few off looking out of place couches in the mezzanine, but I guess you can't love all fashion.   But if you want a beautiful nice spot to talk with someone, that mezzanine is really nice, empty, and private, probably because it was closed. But they were cool enough to open it for us and let us sit there with our drinks. Awesome!  Apparently they also have DJ club nights on Thursday and the weekends so inquire in advance what they're doing that night if you want to go for a quiet meal."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was 21. Great food and amazing local night time lounge spot. A great place to go for a drink. Patio is awesome!!"}
{"text":"The place turns into a club in the evening with the music so loud, the houses across the street at hwy 7 and Ansley Grove can hear the bass and beats reverberate into their homes. The worst days are Thursday to Saturday where they have a special dj night. I'm not certain if this kind of place is enjoyable if you can't even speak to one another at the lounge because you can hear the music being played two blocks down!! At least they close the party up by 2am and the music stops.   At this rate, you can dance at the fortinos parking lot across the street for such loud hip hop/dance they play.  Music is quite obnoxious. Google the place online. Reviews of this place aren't great.  Couldn't agree more."}
