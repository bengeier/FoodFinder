{"text":"They get one star since zero is not an option. We went in for dinner. The food was. Was bland and dried out. The waitress was friendly. But the hostess was very rude. We decided to go elsewhere for dinner. We got up and left mid meal. It's a shame too considering I live next door I see them every night. I love walking up and past seeing the hostess at her stand looking bored out of her mind. No customers and I know why."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time on Valentine's Day 2012.  I requested a table by the window on the phone and the hostess had it written down and honored my request.  The location is outstanding and the views are great.  We were able to park right by the door and it was not all that busy.  I did find this a little odd given it was 7:30 on Valentine's Day.      We had the beet salad, shrimp cocktail and oysters, I had the steak frite and my wife had the short ribs.  The salad was great, the shrimp cocktail was average (all the Hospitality Restaurants are much better, especially Blue Point and Salmon Dave's).  The oysters were better than the shrimp cocktail but nothing spectacular.  The steak dish was very good but the short ribs were just average (there is no comparison to Farenheit with respect to short ribs).  We did order a desert, called the CPP and it was awful.  We sent it back.  It tasted like it was made a few days prior and stored in the fridge too long.  I asked where it was made and our waitress said that they have a pastry chef on site.  They also don't have espresso which I think any nice restaurant should have available.    Our waitress was Erica and she did a great job and made our visit enjoyable, in addition to taking the desert off of our menu.  My wife is pregnant and they brought her a juice drink in a martini glass without asking so we could cheers to Valentine's Day.  They have a good selection at the bar and had Blanton's Bourbon which is always a nice bonus.  All in all it was a good place, I would go back, just not frequently.      I read Bob B.'s review from December 4th and find it odd that they also ran out of sole when we were there which is why my wife had the short ribs."}
{"text":"I could not believe how much I loved this place!  The view is so pretty, and the location feels like you are in your own secret hideaway.  The food was sooooooooooo good.  So good.  I don't just say that.  I had the gnudi (a ricotta gnocchi with a cream based sauce).  GET IT.  Dare I say I have a new favorite place?"}
{"text":"The view is wonderful - unfortunately it ends there.  We stopped in for some small plates and drinks after a concert.  We ordered 4 appetizers/small plates to split between the 6 of us, and also some oysters.  I don't know if it was the time of year or what, but the oysters were awful.  The other appetizers were very under-seasoned and bland.  The service was good, although she didn't seem to even care about the complaints about the oysters, even though 4 of the 6 remained at the end.  Didn't even have orange slices to make a proper Old Fashioned.  The Gnudi appetizer was the best - we would rate it a 7 out of 10.  The rest were 3 out of 10 or under.  Unfortunate, we loved the location and the views, and we wanted to find a new local hangout for dinner, drinks, etc."}
{"text":"I hope they do well. I never go to a new restaurant until they've been open a month. We went to Viaduct on night 3. 'Nuff said.   No bread yet. So how do I suck up the delicious gnocchi sauce?    Scallop app is good. Prosciutto shrimp and big board (meat and cheese) just ok.   Get the 2009 Bouchard Chablis (Chardonnay). Very good. $47   Service seriously lacking.   Hostess was great. Bartender Ericka was great.  All dishes are small for the price. Cioppini was tasty, bit they ran out of Sole. So it consisted of one shrimp, 3 mussels and some baby calamari.   Proceed with caution. They should get better with time. They have 2 other successful restaurants.  Also, very dangerous step to dining area in the corner.  They need to fix this...."}
{"text":"I wish I had gone on Yelp before we went to Viaduct Lounge!! All of the negative reviews are honestly spot on - Yes the service is good and the interior is beautiful, but the food is just shy of awful. I do also want to mention that their music selection was  killer.  We went last night for a random Wednesday night dinner and were 2 of 4 people in the place. That being said, I'm still wondering why it took so long for my boyfriend to get his entree...   We started off with small plates - my boyfriend got the tuna tartar, which was really good, and I got the mussels and  sweet potato fries, which were not. The broth tasted like spicy V8 juice with chunks of tomatoes and onions with bits of chorizo. It was had a \"kick\" to it, but at the same time was still bland. Not sure how that works. The sweet potato fries were equally bland and big and soft. Blah. I ended up requesting both bread and butter and the aioli they serve with the fries on their own - neither components really helped my dish unfortunately. For dinner, I wasn't 'feeling it' so I just ordered a side of the Tuscan brussel sprouts - came in a small dish and charged me $5 - but they tasted ok. My boyfriend ordered the chicken dish with carrots and garlic leek mashed potatoes - sounds pretty kick ass, right? Nope, he was completely underwhelmed.   To top it off, all of this lackluster cost us $75!!   That being said, my biggest disappointment of the night was that they didn't have the salads that they have listed online. I specifically went in for the beet salad and guess what, they didn't have it. I guess I just don't understand why a place that has fresh ingredients doesn't take the time to update the menu online...   The menu overall is strange. There isn't a lot of cohesion to it. There is a raw section and a random salad section, then the \"small plates\" that range from a meat/cheese board to dumplings to pierogies. There also weren't a lot of veggies options - very carb heavy. Nothing jumped out at me as something I had to try, so I guess I wasn't surprised that I wasn't into my meal, but still.   Sadly, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Recently had a celebratory dinner here for a friend and although the location is scenic (via inside tables), the food was mediocre and left me wanting more. We sat on the patio which does not have a nice view unless you enjoy staring at a parking lot. The menu sounds good in theory but the execution falls incredibly short. Service was prompt and courteous. I found the drinks to be the best part of the meal, the berry lemonade martini is tasty and refreshing. I ordered several small plates cause hey, variety is the spice of life, all of which were just eh. And when all else fails, theres always dessert, right? Wrong!! They were all out of dessert except cheesecake so that left me super bummed. Hopefully these are just some growing pains and everything will get ironed out but at this point I can think of many other places with great food and great outdoor space that I would rather go to."}
{"text":"Missed customer appreciation night even though I walk to this place and frequent twice weekly.  Went tonight and bar was full but 3 seats open every other person. Wanted to sit At bar for two and bartender  shuffled us off to raw bar. Didn't,t tell us when two seats opened.....had to keep watching. Would have been nice if he asked ppl to slide one to accommodate us but no such luck. One and out instead of night on town. Home to towers where I can see them out my window."}
{"text":"I am really pretty easy to please and if you read my other reviews you will see I m not a foodie snob.  My experience there on 14 March was my first and it will be my last.  The server was friendly and gave us good advice on their IPA selection.  I was there with three co-workers and nobody was complimentary of the food, though we all enjoyed the view.  First, I started off with oysters.  They were three East coast oysters that were fresh and light on taste, and the dipping sauce they provided was bland.  I then moved on to the NorthWest oysters and the first one had a strong taste, almost like it was bad.  I thought perhaps it was regional differences and like an idiot I tried a second oyster.  I should have forgotten my manners and spit it out.  But I toughed it out.  Needless to say I did not have the last.  My next course was a striped bass with a large amount of grey mushy flesh.  The mash they served with had an off taste, not attributable to remnants of spoiled oyster.  By the time I was halfway home I was ready to wretch up my dinner.  I had cold sweats and a headache.  I don't even want to talk about the next day."}
{"text":"terrible cocktails. just awful. mediocre food at best. for a relatively new place it feels tired. would never go back. no real chef, just some cooks who obviously don't care much. shame on them, if only for the awful beet salad. lazy as could be... sweet server though... she needs to start applying elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered a Dirty Martini here and it went a little something like this:   Me: I'd like a Dirty Martini, please? Bartender: How dirty do you want it? Me: Filthy. Bartender: Jenna Jameson, filthy? Me: YES. PLEASE.  He made sure that my olive was stuffed, and brimming with the softest blue cheese on this side of the Cuyahoga River.  It was probably the best Dirty Martini I have ever had. (And no, I don't say that to all of the bartenders.)  I can only imagine what it would have been like if I asked for it Ke$Ha dirty..."}
{"text":"I was very sad to see that the first few reviews were not so hot, because I had an excellent experience at the Viaduct Lounge!  I made a reservation for a Saturday evening for 12 for a bachelorette party.  We all arrived at different times, were all chatty and taking a long time to get our orders in, yet our server was fantastic! She was very patient with us and made our experience that much better! Being a big group of ladies who are foodies, we decided to make sure there was at least one of each entree at our table when ordering dinner! Each one was tastier than the next! From the pork chop and the cioppini to the short ribs and the sole! yummm! we had a few big boards to start  and then finished with one of each of the desserts, which were also delicious!  A huge thank you to VIaduct Lounge for helping us start out my best friends special evening with a fun and delicious meal! Good luck to you guys! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I loved my experience at Viaduct Lounge! We went there for drinks and appetizers, and had a nice table by the window. The bacon wrapped figs were delicious, and the cocktail shrimp had such delicious, plump, fresh shrimp I couldn't even believe it! They had excellent cocktails. I definitely want to come back for dinner. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here since the soft opening with free appetizers. That event wasn't a really good basis for a review, but I more than made up for that on this past visit. My husband and I met another couple and enjoyed most everything about the place. We took full advantage of the happy hour food offerings. In fact, we literally got one of everything. The offerings were a bargain, and it gave a pretty good idea of the creativity and competence of the kitchen, and it was really impressive. We particularly enjoyed the non-deep fried calamari (a rare find in Cleveland), raw oysters, mussels, and flatbread. The only minor disappointment were the sweet potato fries, which were a bit undercooked and not especially crispy -- surprising since their accompanying fried eggplant were great. Of course, the view and setting are very nice. We'll be back to try an entree-based dinner... if we can manage to avoid the temptation of the excellent happy hour specials."}
