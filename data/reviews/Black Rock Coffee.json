{"text":"I've been off for maternity leave and have done the full coffee walk to ALL of the coffee shops in the area. Black Rock is my favourite for lattes and americanos. Great team that works there and great pricing!"}
{"text":"Perfect vibe, great music, decent coffee, reliable wifi, quirky decor (re: awesome window opening onto the climbing gym). What more can you want of a coffee joint?"}
{"text":"I wandered into Black Rock Coffee hoping that it might be my next favorite coffee shop hangout. So far, so good!

The baristas are super friendly and one of them recommended the Black Sesame Latte. I was hesitant at first, but omg! It was great!

It wasn't packed, which I appreciate and the wifi is good.

I will be back for a second try, for sure."}
{"text":"My last review is still valid. But I wanted to add more.

During the weekday, it's much easier to get a seat. It's also more quiet from a chatter level, but the music is noticeable. If you're picky with music, bring headphones. I love checking ritual before coming here because there is often deals. I tried their drip coffee this time - sour! I personally don't like sour coffee so if you don't as well, I recommend a latte instead."}
{"text":"Cycling down Bloor in Koreatown, I stumbled across Black Rock Coffee which opened up on Friday. I had the cold carbonated tea (AMAZING), decaf latte (they even get fancy and particular with their decaf beans, which is a rare treat) and an almond croissant (fresh and flaky but more marzipan flavour than I love).

Talking with owner/barista Mike (very enjoyable - I recommend it), I learned that Black Rock was started by friends with a serious affinity for caf√©s. While the mechanical engineer and Parkbus owner make unlikely coffee shop owners, they've clearly done their research because they are well versed in the differences between  beans, extraction, calibration methods and more. 

There's even a window in the back wall that you can watch the rock climbers from in the gym next door!"}
{"text":"The Chai Latte is smooth and delicious! Unsweetened, for myself I like it as is, but you can add sugar if you want. None of the excessive sugar that is in mix-based options from other cafes."}
{"text":"Nice coffee and great music!!! I love all music that the owner picked!! Everything was good."}
{"text":"Solid coffee brewed here. They have very friendly staff who make you feel very welcome. Flavour of the coffee is fab and it's a very central and convenient location. Prices are steep for speciality coffees but the quality is quite good. Prices for brew is fair and flavour is very satisfying for caffeine fix.  Will return"}
{"text":"I'll never forget my first time looking up at the chalkboard menu and thinking to myself, damn, I've never heard of a black sesame latte but it sounds amazing so I ordered it and it changed my god damn life as much as a caffeinated beverage possibly could to the point where I immediately left and bought myself a sack of black sesame seeds and ground them up in my pitiful mini food chopper and tried to add them to my coffee at home but failed miserably so I'll just leave it up to the experts I guess and ps there are also people rock climbing in the back of the cafe which is pretty neat if you're into that sort of thing but me, I belong to the church of black sesame lattes now."}
{"text":"I came here to conduct some casual business meetings last week. It's got a quiet enough, relaxed atmosphere. Most valuable for me, it had reliable wifi and a few electrical plugs.

Service was super friendly, and helpful. I had an Americano and a nice drink that the barista created for me. I asked for something cold, non-caffeinated and non-alcoholic. He made me an apple cider with a splash of lemon, which was very refreshing.

This seems to be a space where lots of people work, as nearly half the tables had laptops, and there was another business meeting happening at another table.

This is right near Christie station, and is open until 8pm. It's definitely a spot where I will use to meet people in the future."}
{"text":"This cafe offers a large menu of different specialty drinks! I was glad to see they had matcha lattes so I ordered a medium for here with almond milk (additional 30 cents for non-dairy milk). The barista was super outgoing and friendly. I read another review how the barista was singing very loudly. This barista was singing, not too loudly, but I'm sure everyone could hear her. The music they play is interesting, gives off good vibes. But it's not a soundtrack I would play for studying in the cafe.

There are many tables you can study from, almost all occupied by one or two people per table with their work. If you're having it for here, the barista will tell you to have a seat and you can pick it up once she announces your drink. You can return any cutlery or dishes when you're finished to the bar. 

My matcha latte (priced at a reasonable price $4.50 like other cafes) was certainly beautiful. The almond milk was steamed to the perfect consistency and temperature. However, the matcha taste was not strong as I would have liked it to be. I would have much preferred a stronger matcha powder or more matcha powder. Still delicious though! Almond milk and matcha does not need sweetner/sugar. Wifi was fast and reliable."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, and a cute cafe that would serve well as a study space. The teas are awesome and they have an extensive menu for sweet and savoury treats. I had the almond tea which was really nice. This is one of my favourite tea places in the area."}
{"text":"Actually GOOD coffee!!! Haven't tried everything yet, but so far: the espresso is great, their specialty cold-brew coffee is amazing(!!!) and I'm also a big fan of the iced tea (they have a few awesome fruity flavours on rotation). The baked goods are also quite a treat and there's always good music! Ohhh and you can see right into the Basecamp climbing gym next door, which is super cool!"}
{"text":"So excited that Black Rock coffee joined the neighbourhood! I love watching the climbers in the climbing gym located in the same building perform feats of nature as I sip on what might be the best coffee in town. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffe, fantastic atmosphere and friendly staff. Perfect for meeting friends or just taking a break."}
{"text":"Not bad. Needed to kill some time around here. And it's pretty cool that you can see the people in climbing gym."}
{"text":"Ordered a cappuccino in a chilly night. Surprisingly good! The bartender was very nice too."}
{"text":"Really liked how large and spacious it was inside! Lots of room to sit, and it was a unique space since there was a window where you can see rock climbing next door. The girls at the counter were nice and cheerful. The experience would have been excellent except for...

The coffee (the sole purpose a long 1.5 hr trek)

We ordered a cappuccino and a drip coffee; the beans were from a roaster located in Mississauga which sounded promising. At first sip, all I could taste was its potent sourness mixed with waves of extreme bitterness. Could feel my parotid glands hurting from the spasm of reacting to such a sour taste-- didn't remember cappuccino tasting like that. We go on coffee runs at different local cafes every weekend, so found this one a bit disappointing. Happy to report the drip coffee was slightly better, but the still sour to a lesser degree. Didn't ask for something different since it was the same beans.

While the coffee is not recommended, thinking perhaps other items would be better. Maybe a tea next time? Still deciding whether or not to return."}
{"text":"My favourite cafe in the Annex!

Friendly staff, great music, the atmosphere is very conducing to studying or reading, and good coffee. 

Even though the place is associated with the nearby climbing gym, most of the costumers are not climbers."}
{"text":"We wondered in during the soft open. Super friendly staff, even seeing I already had a coffee in hand. They let me sample their carbonated iced tea and it was super refreshing. We had to ordered one."}
{"text":"A wonderful cafe with very friendly staff and service. Reasonably priced, reliable and fast WiFi, good music and vibes depending on the time Of the day and the mood. 

It's calm and suitable for studying. Wall plugs near a couple of tables. The coffee prices vary between $2.5 - $5. Their cortado is nice, I recommend the cold brew. 

Beer and a handful of cocktails are also served. You have everything you need."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

This is an interesting spot as it shares the space with Base Camp, an indoor climbing gym.  It has a pretty cool  window where you can look in and see the climbers.  It's a calm 'college feel' vibe and fairly big cafe with numerous tables available.  It's quiet enough for anyone wanting to read or do some work.  

When I arrived, it was fairly late into the night and there wasn't a lot of people here.  Only a few people and just one person behind the counter.  A few of the tables had old plates and cups but I guess that adds to the relaxed and super chill college vibe.

We ordered the black sesame and chai latte.  I love how Asian flavours are slowly filtering through Toronto and thought that Black Rock was great to include that as an option.  I liked how they also had almond and soya milk as an option.   

Black Sesame Latte - The black sesame latte was a good choice as it had a good nutty note and not too watered down.  It was a good version. 4/5

Chai Latte - This was really different... it took several minutes to steep but the chai tea latte was more like hot ginger tea.  It only tasted of ginger and incredibly strong... as if it had squeezed fresh ginger juice.  I don't mind ginger but there's no cinnamon, anise... just a huge hit of a firey ginger.  3/5

Its a decent chill spot with free wifi, interesting drinks, and good amount of tables to work.   Definitely a step up from your average coffee spot."}
{"text":"Really cool concept. Drinks are a bit overpriced for the size that you are getting. Cool atmosphere if you are just looking for a place to chat (or have a coffee after you rock climb). Barista's are okay, but seem a bit rushed all of the time even if there are only a couple people in the shop."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when I was dropped off to meet a friend.  I had some time to kill and noticed that the old porn movie theatre was in fact this coffee shop and an indoor climbing gym.

The barista was very nice and recommended the green tea matcha latte and since I didn't feel like tradition coffee or espresso based drinks I decided to try it.  It comes unsweetened which is quite lovely.  You can add your own simple syrup or sugar if you like.

The decor is not fancy or rustic but rather, reminds me of being in a hostel with wooden chairs, the one beat up couch and a bunch of traveling books and photos around.

Free wifi, everyone is doing their own thing... And there is a window into the climbing gym so that was cool too."}
{"text":"Love how I can see rock climbing next door from the big glass window! Interior designs are so nice!

My fried and I ordered Americano and matcha latte. Their Americano was very sour and oxidized old taste. Matcha latte was just tasted like steamed milk. Disappointed. 

And omg.. cashier.. The cashier kept singing songs loud like karaoke bar!!! Everyone who is in the cafe was giving her an obvious look that she has been little too loud in the cafe... But clearly she didn't get the message as she become louder and louder.. 

We ended up to leave because it became so annoying!!! Well at least she was a good singer lol"}
{"text":"Great place with some amazing coffee. If you visiting on a hot day try their special cold brew infused with Nitrogen. Awesome atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to work! Try the Raspberry Lemonade on tap - very good. The staff are lovely people, the wifi is great and the space makes you want to stay."}
