{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Tons of fresh options for lunch. I had the steak (sooo tender melted in you mouth!) jalapeño corn casserole (very tasty with a kick) and the watermelon salad. Omg!!! The watermelon salad was to die for!! Definitely recommend it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Brown bag did the catering for our staff appreciation luncheon at our local elementary school. The luncheon was for 85 teachers and administrators, and every single one of them raved about the food! Everything was fresh and delicious. We will definitely be using them next year for more catering, and I can't wait to take my family and enjoy the restaurant!"}
{"text":"We went to Brown Bag for the first time last week.  Very nice and helpful staff.  I had the salmon burger which was a little spicy but delicious.  The watermelon salad was also very good.  It's nice to see healthy food at very reasonable prices.  I would love to see fresh fruit added as a side.  My only disappointment was the basic grocery store hamburger bun.  It would be nice to have really good bread/rolls to go with all the other great food."}
{"text":"We had catering by Brown Bag - Food With A Purpose today and it was fabulous! Spinach salad with mandrian oranges, blackberries, and dried cranberry, sprinkled with grated parmesan & poppyseed dressing on the side...very fresh & delish! Loved the addition of blackberries. We also had grilled chicken breast, a roasted veggie mix w/zuchini and orange & yellow & red bell pepper, and  skin-on red mashed potatoes. For dessert, brownies & banana pudding. Everything was super delicious!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Nice looking place but food is 'so so'. Does not taste fresh and no more healthy than other take-out places. Similar to food you can simply buy at Publix and prepare yourself. Nice staff. We enjoy trying new places. Good experience but we will not return."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite places to go for lunch! Love the healthy options and simplicity of their menu. Can't get over how genuinely kind the people are. Such good folks ready and willing to make your day better. Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price - it is certainly great food with a purpose. Glad to see these guys in Charlotte as I have used their catering in Knoxville and clients always likes the freshness and health aspects of the food. The great aspect is the catering is always spot on and have never failed in have orders right as called in. Glad to see this well deserved concept expanding to area such as Nashville, Knoxville and now Charlotte."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!
I had the salmon burger with asparagus and jalepeno corn casserole. 
The salmon was very flavorful and the bun was so fresh. The corn casserole kicks in after, I love spicy so it wasn't too hot but it would be considered spicy. The asparagus was char grilled and also had wonderful flavor. 
The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very pleasant.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"With the name of this restaurant, you'd think it would be just a catering business.  You would probably not think of it as a place to go to sit and have a meal, but it's a perfect place for this.  The seating space is very abundant and it seems so open and so clean.   It is located across from Stonecrest, next to Uwharrie Bank.  Apparently their claim to fame is the grilled chicken, so Amy and I both had it.  We ordered two sides to go with  the chicken.  I had the watermelon salad and the jalapeño corn pudding. Before I could get my iced tea from the drink counter, our food was on the table.  FAST!   Everything was so tasty and it sure didn't seem like fast food.   Prices are very reasonable, I am sure partly because this is another order at the counter place and they serve their food on paper plates.  The entire meal was around $10 and there was no tip needed.  The desserts looked wonderful.  There were large brownies and banana pudding offered.   I may have to return for the banana pudding!   They just opened a few days ago, so they haven't been discovered yet. My guess is that they will do well based on the quality of their food and their pricing.  If I were still in the pharmaceutical business, I would use Brown Bag for catering lunches.   It's a really nice addition to the restaurant scene in Charlotte, if you want good food, fast service, and great prices.  Two thumbs up for Brown bag."}
{"text":"Brown Bag catered my office the other day. I had never heard of them before but we have never had food this beautiful and tasty at our office! Such a nice break from cold sandwiches, bbq, and tacos we usually get. The delivery guy was super helpful too!!!"}
{"text":"Holy moly those mashed potatoes and sliced steak?!? Had a delivery to fort mill the other saYou can't beat those prices!!! Not to mention everything stayed hot for hours. All the stands and plates and stuff were included in the delivery fee. Quick and SO EASY to work with. We just texted in our order and they got right back to us. This is what charlottes been needing!!!"}
{"text":"The food is so bomb! Perfect proportions and the banana pudding is to die for. The prices are great just an overall great spot to grab lunch with friends."}
