{"text":"Tried the place based on a reference from a friend. Went midmorning for breakfast and tried my standard \"let's see how they do\" food: chorizo burrito. Loved it. The right mix of eggs and chorizo in a large tortilla. Added the green sauce from the salsa bar. This was the perfect finish for the burrito and my breakfast was fantastic, hot and fresh. Spent some time talking to the owner (Alex) who seems to be really focused on getting all the parts and piece to his new business working correctly. While I was there, a number of people came in who were clearly regulars. This was a nice find for me and will probably become a regular stop for quick and affordable bites to eat. I was suspicious of all the 5-star reviews everywhere but this place seems to have done the \"small taco shop\" right. There is a drive through. The serve Pepsi products. Plenty of seating with maybe 9(?) four-person tables and several high-tops at the window."}
{"text":"This is the best Menudo I have tried in years...
No other place like this one in the area.
Mini Tacos are great. 
Excellent customer service and price."}
{"text":"Great customer service. I tried the grilled chicken burrito and it was a good size with delicious tender chicken."}
{"text":"Ordered a sausage breakfast burrito and carne asada street tacos.  Quality of food and surprisingly quantity were both impressive.  Unfortunately the was very little flavor to anything.   While the carne asada was plentiful tender and cooked well, it seemed to not have any seasoning at all.   Not a dash of salt or any flavor.  Cilantro and corn tortillas added nothing to the flavor/taste.  The breakfast burrito was large and impressive and worth the price. (You will not be hungry after).  We were surprised/ impressed at amount of sausage inside.  Unfortunately this too had little to no taste/flavor.  Bland unsalted eggs, not a lot of cheese added to the so so rating.  This place is close to being really good.  I hope they are able to adapt.  The Quality is there and I appreciate and respect that.  Just give your customers some seasoning.   Raul and Theresa's and Don Panchos have gone so far down hill that I'd like to see this place be a viable option in Avondale.  Would like to try again"}
{"text":"Make sure to try this place and try the mini tacos! Very tasty! Prices are very reasonable!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here today for my husband and I. Got the supreme rolled tacos, beef tostadas, carne asada burrito, horchata and agua de tamarindo. Everything came out delicious. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Delicious, I tried the mini tacos and they were so flavorful, my favorite taco place from now on!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. We tried the Supreme Breakfast Burrito and the Carne Asada Burrito-both a thumbs up. Carne Asada burrito had big junks of onion which I'm not a fan of but it was good. Breakfast burrito was mostly chorizo, not much potato."}

{"text":"Stopped by tonight, Warning the door handle gets hot and the afternoon sun heats things up inside. We ordered Beans, enchiladas and rolled tacos. It was all good. The sauce on the enchiladas was really good, but the cheese was not melted as much as I would like. The rolled tacos, the beef could have had more favor, but I loved that they were not greasy. Give it a chance and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place. We ordered a few items to go. The order was prepared quickly and accurately. We ordered a beef chimichanga, two crispy beef tacos, and a Carne Asada burrito. First thing I noticed after ordering was their carrot, onion, jalape√±o mix in the condiments bar. They actually make it in store. I love this stuff so I was very pleased with the very thick carrot slices. The only thing we weren't too thrilled with was their red sauce. It was very watery. But, it was also very tasty. The tacos were GREAT. They use Black Canyon Angus beef, it it is awesome. Very tender and juicy. And, they actually put a lot in it. The guacamole wasn't a watery paste like most places. The chimichanga was very good. The beef, again, is really good. They add peppers, but not a lot. Also a little odd, there was a very small amount of beans.  Is that to keep it together when they fry it or a filler? The carne asada burrito was very good. Again, the beef really shines. I will absolutely be going back to try almost everything else. Oh, and they have a drive thru. 

Went again. Carne Asada burrito still delicious. The 4 mini street tacos were amazing. Their rice and beans are good. Beef enchiladas were ok, needed more sauce."}
{"text":"It's not hard to find fast Mexican joints around Avondale that satisfy the craving. But my gosh, was Mariachi's GOOD. We ordered via drive-thru (don't be a goof and wait at the first menu board like we did), and our food was ready in just over 10 minutes- a little lengthy but the food was fresh and still piping hot when we got home. 

We got 2 orders of mini tacos with both grilled chicken and carne asada, as well as a large carne asada fry. All of it was incredibly flavorful, authentic, everything we wanted. So happy to have found a new spot!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. I have four words.

{"text":"This is my first time coming and the Menudo was horrible and it did not even taste like Menudo. it taste like canned menudo so gross. Won't be coming back. I couldn't even finish it."}
