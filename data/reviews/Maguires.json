{"text":"Excellent atmosphere very friendly people  and great bar staff. For a healthy choice food amazing it is oven baked no fryers.  Real Irish people in thus pub, it is like taking a trip to Ireland in your own back yard. The Guinness is amazing as well and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We went here not expecting much and left more then impressed. It's what you'd expect a local pub to be like! Hadn't visited in a couple years and had a great time! The waitress was fantastic it wasn't too crowded. Great nachos as well!"}
{"text":"Biased opinion as I am friends with one of the bartenders, but I do like this place, and it's one of the few in Brampton that still has live music sometimes.  Traditional Irish pub catered towards older crowd.  Thank God it's not Fionn Maccools."}
