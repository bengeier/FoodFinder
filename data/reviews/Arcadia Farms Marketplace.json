{"text":"I'm pretty sure when I stopped in this week that I found my new place to get gifts for those who love to cook and love food. This cute marketplace/bakery is adjacent to the Arcadia Farms restaurant and is one of the absolute most fabulous retail places I've seen in the area.

The vibe of the store is as if Ina, Martha and Nigella decided to go \"all in\" on a retail store location. I kid you not that it's a sensory experience of beautiful creations and delicious smells and at the same time visually appealing.

If you want to eat something sinfully amazing and hang out in a very beautiful setting and at the same time want to get a thoughtful gift or start your Xmas shopping, this is the place."}
{"text":"I recently saw an advertisement on Instagram and wanted to purchase what they were advertising. I emailed them thru their contact email, never heard back. I called several days later and was told manager Sophie(a) would call me back, never got a call. Called back three days later and once again told Sophie would call me back, have never heard from anyone. How is a customer suppose to do business with you, please explain to me? I live out of state and have finally contacted a friend that lives in Scottsdale and they are going out of their way to go by Marketplace for me. Customer service really needs some work."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch and left incredibly disappointed. Received only half of our order and after 45 minutes of waiting for the other half, they brought out a sandwich that consisted with egg on bread- and nothing else. Obviously not our order. It took them another half an hour to remake the sandwich and us asking about its status 2 additional times. Worst service I've seen and a waste of an entire afternoon.

Additionally, while the store was completely empty, the entire inside and outside of the restaurant was in complete disarray. Garbage piling up and overflowing in bins, uncleaned tables and the staff couldn't have cared less. 

Needless to say, we will not be back- and you shouldn't go either."}
{"text":"We were hungry after some wine tasting in Old Town Scottsdale, so decided to stop by the Arcadia Farms marketplace for a quick sandwich.  The market is really nice - great selections, beautiful space and super friendly staff.  I enjoyed a caprese sandwich that was fresh and so tasty and we sat inside to enjoy it.  I highly recommend stopping in for a sweet treat, coffee or other beverage or a sandwich - what's not to love about Arcadia Farms?"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee/dessert place with gifts and books. A little too small for me, but nice place for older ladies. I'd definitely come here to pick up a mini cake or dessert for take out."}
{"text":"Sometime after lunch at your cafe next door, I'll walk in to your marketplace. I love getting the Greek salad or panini. What I love is when I cook dinner and want to have a small dessert after I'll swing by and pick out something. When my mom is in town I'll take her in and she loves all of the items you sell."}
{"text":"Beautiful space.  Really a nice spot to grab a quiet bite with my wife. Perfect breakfast quesadilla.  Savory and delicious. Also enjoyed the goat cheese omelet. Super nice staff. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"While Arcadia Farms Cafe (nextdoor) is one of my all time favorites, Arcadia Farms Marketplace is a fabulous, faster alternative for a quick bite.  The food at the marketplace is made in advance and the selection is limited, but if you're in a pinch, it will definitely do.  Same friendly service and quality ingredients in an adorable atmosphere.

Bonus: the marketplace offers all kinds of gifts and trinkets... perfect for a hostess or for your own home entertaining.  They offer some adorable kids things too.

I often order catering from the Arcadia Farms family and if I pick it up, it's the Marketplace that I pick up from.  I've lost track of how many visits I've paid to AFM, but I know for sure that I've never left disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came her for Brunch during a girls trip. Amazing food,service and ambience. We kept talking about how we wanted to go back again as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Is it a curse or a gift? Well in my case that depends on where I am because I have a nose like a blood hound, I smell stuff people around me don't no even exists. Just walking down the street can be an adventure. 

This morning it was a gift because at about Indian School and Camelback at 7:30 AM I was very early for a meeting and looking for Coffee. And there on the morning air was potatoes and bacon. Like  a Blue tick hound on a Texas boar I tracked that smell to the Arcadia Cafe.  

They seated me outside and brought me coffee and a warm, and incidentally wonderful, Scone. What a great way to start. I ordered eggs bacon and toast with potatoes. Pretty boring right?

The eggs were perfect, the Bacon just right, but wouldn't you expect any restaurant to get the right? I agree so let's talk about the potatoes. 

I normally am not a fan of big chunky morning potatoes. As in, I love the Adobe restaurant but I will not abide those terrible potatoes they serve. Yea yea I know, personal preference because lots pf people love them. It's that nose thing, I smell things about them you don't notice. These potatoes, at Arcadia, have subtle flavors, are not cooked to death,  are not full of soggy peppers, and I gobbled up every one of them.

The coffee has flavor, not big and bold but flavorful and they keep it coming. 

They do not serve Tabasco, which I love, but the Crystal hot sauce was more than acceptable. 

I should mention the service. It was impeccable. There is a difference between being attentive and being obnoxious and  most servers do not have the training to know the difference. Here they know how to provide great service, and ambiance. The music is not obtrusive and the staff is friendly and helpful but not trying to be part of your meetings.  

So drop in this place and ask for the coffee and a scone and then contemplate the menu, or what ever  you contemplate in the AM."}
{"text":"I took my Mom to Arcadia Farms today for her birthday. I made reservations and wrote a note that it was her birthday. After we were seated on time, we had to wait 45 minutes to receive our food! I had to inform the hostess! The waitress came by and made some lame excuse blaming it on management. I didn't see how it could be the manager's fault! They did give us a free dessert, but nothing special for my Mom's birthday! The food was o.k., the dessert was very good, but I think our waitress FORGOT about us! I was very disappointed! Then if things couldn't get worse, there was this awful rude guy who valet parked my car! He charged $3 to park my car plus a tip!!! He worked across the street for Valet of the Sun. DON'T USE THIS! TAKE YOUR TIME AND PARK DOWN THE STREET! If I would have known about this parking rip off, I would have parked my car myself and not deal with this jerk who just wanted money!"}
{"text":"Stoped by to grab some deserts and pastries at this amazing little place. Feel like going into a little french home with cute purchasable items!! Their cook left at 230 pm even though they close at 3 so we got their tuxedo cake...my wife said it was the best cake she had had in the valley since we arrived!!! The almond croissant and fruit tart were amazing!! The vanilla latte was very good as well!!"}
