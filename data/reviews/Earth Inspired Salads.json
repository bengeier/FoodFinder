{"text":"The service here is awful! Grumpy, irritated staff and a man (who I think I was to assume was a manager) who was condescending, rude and  completely unfriendly. Their prices are very high ($1.50 for 1/4 of an avocado). I would just assume go to Hello Bistro because if I am going to pay $12.58 for a salad, it will have multiple toppings and friendlier staff. Stay far away from this place!"}
{"text":"I really like the salads here BUT ive been there on at least two occasions where ive seen two different employees (BOTH being the person in charge - which is why this is so disturbing) shake the salad dressing by placing BARE ungloved fingers over the dispenser of the salad dressing bottle! Then they touch the gross ipad register screen and do it again"}
{"text":"Two stars since I haven't tried other items on the menu. The Fiesta Bowl, however, is something I wouldn't order again. Lots of brown rice (some even crunch), cold chicken, some beans, and a dollop or guacamole."}
{"text":"Came in a few minutes after 5. Web site said they are open until 6. I ask for a Borderline salad. I am told they already put away all the meat and cheese bc they are getting ready to close. I said I thought they closed at 6. They said yeah, but they start putting things away early.  I'm writing this at 5:25 - and have been back in my hotel room for about 10 minutes. They should still have the meat and cheese out if they don't close until 6.  I'm steered to the premade salads. I'm not happy, but have been eating unhealthy takeout most of the week. I grab 2 salads and go pay. I get back to my hotel - I have no forks (they knew it was takeout - and that I didn't live in town and didn't either give me forks or direct me to where I could pick them up) and NO DRESSING in one of the salads. And it was $20 for 2 salads.   I really wanted to like this place, but no."}
{"text":"I must be a glutton for punishment because I just keep coming back.  This time may very well be the last.  I ordered their E tu Brute and there seems to be some type of unpleasant crunching within the salad as if there were sand on the kale or spinach.  I would like to assume it was washed, but I'm not convinced.  However, the over arching problem with this place is the absolute and complete lack of consistency.  I found myself praying to not get certain employees to assemble my salad because they would come out horribly bad.  Usually drenched in salad dressing or next to none, skimping on ingredients, etc.  I think they need to work to train their employees in order to offer a more consistent product.  The biggest issue is the salad dressing - what does light, medium, or heavy mean?  Well it could either be entirely the same or completely different depending on what employee you get to make your salad.  Also, most (not all) of the employees need an attitude adjustment.  This indicates to me that management is lacking.  Please train people!  and supervise  them appropriately!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and has great service. I usually make my own salad: pick my own greens and 4 fresh toppings for less than $7.  As an added bonus, you can get a free slice of delicious whole grain bread with it. It's just a great deal that fills me up and satisfies my occasional need for a healthy lunch.  Thanks for being an oasis of fresh food downtown!"}
{"text":"1st and last time...  I remember a place called SaladTime in Bridgeville that was awesome, polite people good salads, excellent dressings!  It closed at some point last year and I've been looking for a new place that \"specialized\" in salads.  This place is not it.  The restaurant is small, which is fine.  There are a few tables inside and a few for those that would like to site outside.  The menu is positioned for easy reading and is presented nicely.  That's about all I can say good about this place.  I ordered my salad off of their pre-selected menu; Sheil Salad which includes Kale, baked falafel, tomato, cucumber, garbanzo beans and pita chips.  The salad I received included spinach and kidney beans (healthy scoop) neither of which I requested.  The good thing about the kale and spinach was that it was washed, the bad was that it was still covered in water which rendered the dressing tasteless.  Aside from the food, which to me is the most important, was the horrible service.  The person that took my order was asking me questions with her head to the ground while behind a glass case.  I had to ask \"excuse me\" at least three times before I could understand her.  Then we move to the cashier who was mumbling something to me.  After a few attempts I realized she was telling me the total.  I apologized and handed her my card and said thank you when she handed it back.  She then hands me my salad in a bag over the counter while speaking to someone behind her...  I normally expect some sort of thank you or have a nice day at this point; nothing.  I don't expect 5 star food or 5 star service but for nearly $10 I would like to think I would get what I ordered correct and maybe a little customer service.  No I didn't go back as I was already at the office when I noticed it was incorrect."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to get a salad downtown while visiting Pittsburgh and found this place. I chose to select my own ingredients. I started with their mesclun greens, and added chickpeas, diced beets, red onions, sunflower seeds, goat cheese, and a sliced hard-boiled egg. They offered me samples of their dressings, and I chose the Dijon vinaigrette. The ingredients were extremely fresh and flavorful. I am something of a salad connoisseur and have salad for lunch often. This was the best salad I have had in recent memory. The total price was a little under $10, and the serving size was perfect. My appetite was satisfied for the whole afternoon. Finally, the service was awesome. The guys working there were friendly and attentive and gave the place a nice atmosphere. The decor is also bright and cheerful. To me, the price seems right considering the quality of the food and the service. Note that I do not give 5-star reviews lightly, but this place deserves it!"}
{"text":"I'm over this place. I started working downtown recently and was on the hunt for a solid salad place. I've now been to Earth Inspired Salads about 5 times and have yet to be impressed. Let me start with the good: their salads are really delicious and the ingredients are fresh. However, I have yet to have my order be correct. In the 5 times, there has been something wrong each time. Mind you, I order off of the menu, I don't make substitutions, and still they can't make the salad correctly. Every time I am asked if I would like a free slice of bread and every time I answer \"No thank you\". I've had bread in my salad 4 out of 5 times. My favorite salad is Thai One On. The first time I ordered it, they forgot to give me dressing. Not a huge issue because the seaweed salad itself has a ton of flavor. Today when I ordered the Thai One On, they remembered to give me dressing, but it was not the delicious Miso Soy Ginger Vinaigrette. No, it was a full squirt of olive oil. Do you realize how unappetizing it is to get back to your desk and find that your salad is drenched in olive oil? Unacceptable. Why have pre-picked salads on your menu if you can't even make them correctly?"}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced. 13.00 for a small salad? Barely got any of the highly touted \"4 free toppings \" of which the selection was dismal. 1.25 for a small pinch of cheese? 2.50 for literally 4 small cubes of chicken. I also don't understand the concept of loud music when you can't even hear yourself let alone talk to the person who's trying to build your salad. Turn down the music, turn down the prices or turn off your lights and close."}
{"text":"This place gets a low rating because they are cheap and instruct their employees to skimp on proteins.  You'll pay $11 for a salad that may have 5 small cubes of slimy, rubbery chicken.  Charge me $6-7 for that or give me ingredients for $11--either way works.  That measuring \"scoop\" they have is rarely used and, when it is, they fill it 1/2 way.  Everything else about this place is great.  It is quick and convenient.  Avoid salads with meat because you won't get any--the Sheik with falafel is quite good.  Their cheapness will be their demise, however.  The size of the lunch crowd has diminished so rapidly since they opened that I give them another year, tops, before shutting down.  You'd be better off going to Hello Bistro or any local salad bar."}
{"text":"The salads are very good here and the staff is great. Everyone who works there is very friendly.   2 things I would change- 1) the rice bowls are really not good and I almost didn't go back after having a few of them. But I tried the salads and they're amazing. 2) the font on the signs in the store are way too small"}
{"text":"Had the Bovine Blue.  A really nice salad with nice ingredients...  except for the steak.  Dont waste your money on the steak.  Not much meat, small cold lumps, with with very little flavor."}
{"text":"Over priced and not that great.  For a place called Earth Inspired Salads I expected quite a bit more.  For $8 I got a lot of lettuce and a tiny amount of toppings.  I added a meager amount of grilled chicken and almonds for another $2.  Included in my 4 toppings I received over ripe mushy tomatoes, and microscopic chopped green peppers - so chopped I didn't think he put any in there.  The dressing I ordered was tomato cilantro jalapeno pepper - tasty right - nope- all I tasted was oil.  Very disappointing - do not waste your money, I should have gone to Wendy's"}
{"text":"Great salads! A little expensive but convenient. The girl at the counter explained the options really well and the salad was great. Goat cheese was amazing! Good portions too."}
{"text":"I went in for a rice bowl but apparently they ran out of rice. They asked me to get rice bowl with wild rice and I agreed to it. The bowl seemed to cost 11 bucks but Just had rice, chicken, Guacamole and salsa. I felt that the bowl was a little overpriced for very little ingredients. The staff are very friendly though.  Not satisfied with my bowl and that's why the 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy options. It's nice that you can customize your salad or choose one from the board already if you don't want to build your own."}
{"text":"Best place to get a salad. Outstanding value for price. I always get the local greens mix with \"4 fixins\" for under $7.  They have a wide selection of toppings it gets hard to pick. Their employees are friendly and attentive. The greens are never wilted or sad. The salads (at least the ones I get) come with free bread. They ask you how much dressing you want which I love because I hate getting too much dressing. My favorite part, they MIX THE SALADS FOR YOU!! I don't have to awkwardly fiddle with a salad over-stuffed in a tiny container making a mess anywhere. I love going here for a hearty, healthy and filling lunch that won't break the bank.  EDIT: I recently went there again and wound up receiving a surprisingly small portion. It was too small to be acceptable, since it was roughly half to 2/3 the size of the portions I normally get. I was disappointed, especially because when I went in that day, they weren't even busy or rushed. So I e-mailed the address provided on their site and sent a picture of the problem and they were very understanding and professional and sent me a $10 gift card. Hopefully when I go back it won't happen again, but I appreciated the good customer service. [P.S. after reading this, don't be that person who makes something up to complain about so they can get free food. There are too many people who do that and it's not okay unless you ACTUALLY have a real problem with your food.]"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Thankful to all the cooks. Loving the salad options and the people. Happy to have noticed this place open February of 2017 and happy and satisfied every time. Salads are colorful and filling. The bread is a nice touch. Soups are colorful and tasty! Thank for all your efforts! I'm a fan!  Recommend if you love your pallet for spicy: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Chicken."}
{"text":"The food was a little expensive and the selection was limited.  But hey, these folks are running their business right.  Stick with what you know and don't leave money on the table. My salad was delicious. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I found this place wondering around downtown and I'm glad I stopped in. Their salad bowls are really good. I had a build your own kale salad and really liked the curried cauliflower and Adobo chicken (which isn't spicy) I got with it. The bread was tasty too since it had poppy seeds in it with oats and sunflowers on the top. I also really liked the atmosphere since they had potted plants and herbs near the tables at the window. I'm definitely going to come back next time I bike in the city for a nice light and healthy meal."}
{"text":"The King Cobb is absolutely excellent. All the ingredients are fresh, and they ask you how much dressing you want so your salad isn't absolutely drowning. A great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I am of the opinion that people that hate salads have just been eating boring salads. As a person that used to hate salads, I consider myself a connoisseur of creative salads. This place has truly got some creative salads. I've been wanting to try them for a while, and the long lines elsewhere in market square finally convinced me. I got the \"Thai One On\" salad. It has Grilled Shrimp, Sesame Broccoli, Radishes, Carrots... and a wonderful seaweed salad I just went gaga for. I seriously just adored that stuff.  The blend of toppings was successful, and they didn't skimp on the shrimp! (THANK YOU!) I will definitely come back. Yum!"}
{"text":"So this used to be called something else.  When it was, it was better.  Now they have the same menu, same pretty high prices and worse food.  I used to love the Thai salad - shrimp, seaweed salad, carrots, radish, sesame broccoli, almonds and an awesome Thai dressing.  While all the toppings are reasonable, the lettuce was super bitter and they put no dressing on it at all, so I am basically just eating a bucket of lettuce.  The next time I want a salad I will walk around the block to Hello Bistro."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place with a co-worker because it's close to where we work. We are always on the look out for good salad places, and we passed this place a few times.  First impression? Extremely stupid design. They have doors that all merge in on each other, making it impossible to leave if someone is coming in. Hard to explain.   Anyway, they have a base price for lettuce and 4 toppings, then extra for meats and cheeses and avocado. After a long wait, I finally get to place my order, and was astounded by how little in toppings they gave. Not that they have much in the way of choices. Little mini scoops of toppings on my salad. I got chicken, which was an extra three dollars, and a pinch of parmesan cheese, an extra 1.75. No drink. I got to the register and it was over 12 dollars for this little salad. What. A. Ripoff. I'd understand the price more if they actually loaded the salads up...but this was just bad. I cannot understand why people flock to this place. I don't understand the good reviews either.   I'll never go there again. Ever. I'll walk an extra block to get a much better salad at a better price. I'd rather have Hello Bistro, it's a couple blocks away, but I can get a bigger salad and a drink for less than 10 dollars."}
{"text":"Britney the director is fantastic!!!! She effectively runs two locations that are extremely well stocked and clean! The ingredients are always fresh and the employees are very friendly!!"}
{"text":"My salad was a mix of kale, mesclun and spinach with four ingredients of my choice. Lots of options to build a custom salad. If you don't feel like building your own, they have a separate menu of salads to choose from. Service was quick and salad was delish."}
{"text":"This place is great!  You can get virtually any kind of lettuce, veggie, topping, meat, and dressing that you could want and they toss it for you.  The portions are huge, which justifies the (pretty high) price.    I would recommend telling them to go \"light\" on the dressing (options are light, medium, and heavy), because they can be heavy-handed.   I found my new go-to lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite lunch spot.  I like the vegetarian options and how I can mix it up and get different toppings/lettuces/dressings all the time.  I recently came for their new breakfast and found it to be just as great as lunch.  My breakfast wrap took longer to make but was worth rolling into work a little late for some fresh eggs and veggies.  The space is inviting and clean too!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch places downtown.  I am not a huge salad person, but the ingredients they use here are so fresh and delicious that I can't imagine anyone not enjoying them here.  They allow you to either make your own custom salad from scratch or have one of their creations.  You can also choose if you want light, regular or heavy dressing.  My go to is the Et tu Brute salad.  It is a kale based salad with an amazing caesar like dressing.  The piece of bread they give you with it pairs great with the salad.  Even though it is one of their healthier salads, it keeps you full.    There are so many great options here, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went to this establishment with a coworker during lunch time and it was an intense experience.   While standing in line I was reading the menu and I found a pre-made salad I wanted to try, but I wanted to ask if I could swap onions for another item. But when I was next I greeted with \"what do you want\" & in a very unfriendly voice. Instantly I just decided to just go with a make your own, because apparently the person and most of the other works were in a horrible mood. While telling them the ingredients I said I'd like avocado, which is $1.50 more (don't do it, you get less than a fourth of the avocado). Rudely I was yelled at that it cost extra, when I shook my head and said I understand they just rolled their eyes and seemed extremely bothered.   Lastly the gentleman who gentleman at the cashier was very impatient and rude. I handed him my card, he gave me a price and the yelled here!  The food was very good, the options for the salad was great I love they had seaweed & goat cheese. They had a nice selections of greens, no one ever has kale as an option.   Just the small cramped line & the very rude workers are not work the good food."}
{"text":"Love love love Earth Inspired Salads (formerly Toss't)!  They have a great variety of salad toppings, different kinds of lettuce, dressings (the Miso Soy Ginger is my go to), and proteins to choose from.  The staff is always really friendly and quick, which is a plus since I only ever go there during my lunch break. The inside is small but pretty cool, and there are a couple small tables to sit at if you want to eat there, but I've always taken mine to go.  It's a great little place and if you're in the mood for something light and healthy, definitely try it if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I've walked past Earth Inspired so many times and have always wanted to go in! Today I decided to go for it and was really happy with the experience! All of the staff was really friendly and helpful! I ordered a \"Thai one on\" salad and it was delicious! The salad comes with mixed greens, carrot, radish, seaweed salad, shrimp and spicy broccoli. i'm not a big broccoli fan and they let me sub some edamame instead. The veggies were very fresh and the shrimp was delicious. I have seen some people discuss the price but I felt $10 was fair for how much food I got. The miso dressing was a little bit oilier than what I would like but overall the salad was great! It also came with a tasty slice of multi grain bread, in which my thighs told me to avoid but I was happy I didn't listen. It was very hardy and full of yummy seeds!  I will definitely be back to try more of their salads! You can also make your own and there are tons of toppings to choose from! Very pleased."}
{"text":"Well, I REALLY wanted to love this place.  The website was neat and informative, and the store itself is amazing.  When you walk in, you can smell the fresh vegetables.  Clean as a whistle, and the glass-doored fridges were bursting with colorful veg.  The space has enormous ceiling and is decorated as you would think a trendy vegetarian place should be.   The worker was very friendly and laid back (again, think hippie-chic), and was amazingly helpful.  I ordered the 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Chicken, and they were quickly receptive to the request for a substitution.  The salad was made in a giant bowl right in front of you, and I was amazed at the amount each of fixings added.  I asked for heavy dressing, the tomato-dijon jalapeno, and went back to work, excited for my feast.  What a let-down.  The flavors just weren't there.  The dressing seemed to have spice, but not a \"kick,\" and almost no flavor whatsoever.  I tried adding salt and pepper (more than once), but with no luck.  I understand that it is supposed to be a health-food place, and I will try it again with a stronger dressing or added cheese, but this place just didn't \"do it\" for me."}
{"text":"Service was slow because only one person was working, other than that, pretty good salads and soups at decent prices"}
{"text":"I ordered the king cob salad with salmon, and it was pretty good. The salty cheese paired with the Smokey bacon was superb. The salmon was a little bland, and the could have probably added a little more.   One disappointing aspect was the dressing. I would have expected a citrus dressing, but they served it with a white sangria vinaigrette. This sounded interesting, but the flavor was lacking of really any flavor and the consistency was a little flem like.....sorry. I would probably go again and try something else. The staff was helpful and quick, and, overall, the atmosphere was friendly. I just won't try that dressing again."}
{"text":"The salads were dry, the quinoa was dry, my friends and I did not enjoy any of our meals. The atmosphere inside isn't great at all and the worker was texting while we were trying to speak to her. Overall not a great experience."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it's close to the office and there aren't many healthy options close by but I didn't enjoy my bowl at all.   I got the Fiesta Bowl and it wasn't what I expected. I opted for the spicy chicken and it was cold rather than warm. If I had known this I would have gotten different chicken or a cold salad. The combination of warm rice, cold veggies, and cold chicken mixed together made a cold to lukewarm bowl which was kind of blah. Additionally I added a sauce but the bowl just didn't have any kick to it.   The redeeming part of the experience was that the employees were so nice! Everyone that I interacted with made me want to like my bowl so much more than I did. I'm curious to try the salads and see if I enjoy it more, but I'm not rushing to come back."}
{"text":"This is Earth Inspired Salads 2nd location to downtown (other store is located on 5th Ave near Market Square). Located directly across the street from Hotel Monaco. The restaurant was super clean and very well designed with plenty of seating to eat in. This was actually my first time eating at EIS and I have to say that I will definitely be back! I've always been a huge fan of Hello Bistro for an alternative, healthy lunch.   However, EIS is on a whole other level when it comes to healthy and fresh. Their concept is the same as Hello Bistro but the quality of produce seems well cared for as their brochure talks about having a commitment towards sourcing local farmers to provide healthy, fresh ingredients. I also like the idea of being able to see the calorie intake for their \"Inspired salads\". If by chance you're feeling creative, you can also build your own. However that seems like it could turn out to be a little pricey (add-ons). This location also offers grain bowls which is a mix of brown, wild and barley rice. Daily soup solutions and my favorite feature of all - gluten free dressings! Eat in, pick up or order out!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I've never been a fan of buying salads. If I want a bowl of vegetables, I can throw that together myself at a fraction of the cost. My friends, however, absolutely love this place, so after a year of listening to them rave on and on about Earth, I finally gave in.   The Beets 'n Berries sounded like a delicious way to kickstart my relationship with Earth AND it's only 391 calories. They have a build-your-own option but only the first 4 add-ins are free and all the proteins come with an extra charge (a pretty hefty one at that). We came in during the lunch rush so the tiny shop was uncomfortably full. The employees seemed a bit frazzled and kept forgetting what to put in the salads. Once I got the finished product, I was a little disappointed to see that the container was not even full. The ingredients were fresh and the vinaigrette was tasty, but nothing about it was impressive or special. I was hungry again after an hour.   Overall, the quality or quantity of the salads do not justify the prices they charge. If anything, I would opt for Hello Bistro because at least you can choose as many toppings as you want instead of being nickel and dimed."}
{"text":"I will say this over and over again. Salads are usually boring. But there are certain places that can make a stellar salad, and I can confirm it is here! I almost wish I worked downtown so I can grab a salad from here daily.   I ordered the Cobb Salad with Salmon and it seriously was delicious. There was ample parts toppings to lettuce to dressing. That might be the key to a good salad, along with good quality ingredients. While it's not a cheap salad, at $12, it still was worth it to me because of how good it was.   The staff was really nice and was able to answer all my questions (I always have too many!). I'm very interested to try out more salads when I'm downtown again. Who knows, maybe I'll have to make a special trip... Or they'll just have to be more successful that they open up more locations around town!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place 2 or 3 times. I want to like it but I'm always disappointed. The service sucks, especially at the end of the day. They close up well before closing hours. If you try to order something they are \"all out\" or will just direct you to the pre-prepared items. Their dressings are bland and too oily. I've had to bring a salad home to add lemon juice, just to cut the overwhelming abundance of oil with which my salad was dressed. Yuck."}
{"text":"I am a big Whole30/Paleo eater and this restaurant appeared when I searched for Paleo friendly places in the burgh. I was excited by all the good whole foods I saw on the menu and they were easily able to find the ingredients to a salad dressing I asked about. I ordered the \"Talk Curry To Me\" salad and subbed lettuce for rice. It was really delicious! The only reason I docked a star is that the salad was kind of comically small...and it cost over $10. It didn't even have meat on it. That will probably keep me from coming back on the regular. But if you're looking to treat yoself or don't want to prepare a meal for a day and are trying to keep it healthy, it's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Update from the long standing check in all-star of this joint ... This is obviously a summer/sping type of thing chomping down on them greens, you know?  This is my second time back since spring decided to rear it's ginger head and honestly ... I gotta drop some stars here. Sorry Earth. I used to love this place, now it's getting kinda shabby.  Behind the glass them toppings are getting slim. Meaning what Don? I'll tell you! Relax. Damn! As I was saying ... the beans were looking sketchy, cheese all mixed in with the peppers, no more of them mandarin slices? What? And no quinoa today? Huh? I've never heard that sentence in my life. C'mon Earth. You know you slippin. Kinda like the planet you're named after ... if you think about it. Bet you didn't know this grub review was going to go all philosophical, huh? Bet. Pick it back up and I'll break out them missing stars homeboys and girls. You had it, gotta get back there. Thanks!"}
{"text":"quaint, simple restaurant.  The salad I ordered had fresh chicken, spinach, kale and a few other toppings. It was a fairly large salad that came with a slice of whole grain bread.  My salad tasted very fresh and everything inside looked clean.  With the salad and a drink I paid a little over 13$ which I thought was a bit pricey. Overall good place to go for a quick, healthy lunch."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something light and healthy for lunch and and need a quick option, this is your place. Efficient, delicious, and all the salad fixings are crisp and fresh. TWO THUMBS UP!"}
