{"text":"Waited months to try this place due to the previous reviews. Was not disappointed with the food or the atmosphere. No wait, fast service and delicious food. Everyone should give it a try and disregard previous reviews. -#yolololos"}
{"text":"Went to this place 1st time on Fathers Day 2015, Walked in offered immediate seating outside under mister, or 1/2 hour wait, choose to sit out side, NOT hot w/ mister and shade, order chicken wing and waffle, when in Rome do what makes sense, got fried green tomato as app, both were excellent, other food ordered was banana nut pancakes and adult mac and cheese. First time ever to this place and have to say food was all excellent, big portion and quality food.
2 NEGATIVE-- Service was horrible, slow, slow, slow, 20 mins from sitting down until even took drink order, and great portion size but very expensive, so value for what you pay for, but if you would like a small cheap meal this is not the place, giant portion"}
{"text":"Waited an hour when they said it would be 30 minutes.  Got seated and we ordered immediately.  Took 50 minutes for food to come.   Doesn't matter if food is good or not, I was pissed we had to wait so long."}
{"text":"Highly overrated and very disappointed! The waffles were good but the chicken had ZERO seasoning, very greasy and the Breast was over cooked and the oil tastes as if it had been sitting in an old coffee can the past week! The only reason I gave it two stars is because the waiter was very nice and removed the item from out ticket.
Would definitely never return and would never recommend to anyone!
If roscoes stays open I would recommend people take a day trip instead of trying LOLO's!"}
{"text":"Not worth the hour+ wait. Chicken wasn't bad, waffles were yummy, but the sides were disappointing. The Mac n cheese tastes like it's made with Velveeta and Cream of Mushroom soup, and the noodles were overcooked. Grits were like watery Cream of Wheat. And no mashed potatoes and gravy on the menu! There has to be a better fried chicken place somewhere."}
{"text":"Wait time on the weekends is not even worth it . and the waitress that helped us never checked in on us until it was time for her to grab the check . And for the food , it was okay . The chicken was very dry , even with the gravy . It just needs work ."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE IVE EVER BEEN TO. Saturday morning around 10am we told the hostess party of four. She said 45 minutes. TWO HOURS LATER we got our table. Hostess were incredibly rude and quoting people way under estimated time. There were at least five dirty tables at a time. Nobody had any idea what was going on. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks. Then an additional HOUR an 15 minutes to get our food. Two of the orders were completely wrong and cold. The so called manger came over and helped out with nothing what so ever. Multiple people around us were complaining about the same things. I've worked in the service industry for 7 years and I couldn't believe what was happening. If I was the OWNER I would close down the place and hire all new staff and actually train them because this was a zoo and a mess. Worst place I've ever been to and will not go back and tell everyone I know not to waste there time and go there. Hands down the worst restaurant and experience I've ever had and been too."}
{"text":"Under normal circumstances would have given 4 stars, however today I found the food and serves below their standard and way below mine. After waiting about 20 minutes for our food to come out, my waffles where overcooked. Spoke to the waitress she offer to bring out a new order. Well it took another 20 minutes by that time my group was finishing their meal and the second waffle was dry toast. Overall a very negative experience even with speaking to the manager."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have gone there three times.  First time with one of my daughters.  Second time with both my daughters and the third time just last night with a birthday party group.  They are so nice and the food is amazing.  I have only had one experience with a bad plate but they were very nice about replacing the dish with another and we still enjoyed our visit.  Their personnel are very friendly and accommodating.  I have never had to wait to be seated or had a bad experience with a waiter or waitress.  After my family visited, my oldest daughter decided to have her best friend birthday party there.  We had a very nice time and everyone in our party was so happy with their food and service.  Even the owner came over to our table and interacted with us.  What a nice guy.  The staff sang \"Happy Birthday\" to our guest.  Will tell everyone about this place and \"WILL\" be going back again.    Good Job LoLo's.  Joann C"}
{"text":"we have been to the gilbert location several times, and each time the food loses quality.  Today we ordered,take out and the server there had no idea they carried sweet potatoes and told us we were wrong.  We ordered the three piece dinners which are pricey and suppose to come with corn bread, didn't get that either.  I called once we got home, and the front desk person just said oh ok ya I will tell them.  No apology or anything.  I guess we made our last visit. review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Catfish burnt on a take out order.  Given a credit since I was not driving all the way back to restaurant.  Called to confirm credit.  It cannot be found, was escalated to Operations Manager to receive same day call back.  3 days later no response.  Managers hold servers to a higher level of customer service than they even provide.  Original location or Scottsdale are much better options then this one."}
{"text":"I've given this place three chances - one in Scottsdale and two in Gilbert.  Biscuits were undercooked and doughy today.  The three pieces of chicken and two waffles were average at best.  The chicken was decent but nothing to write home about.  The homemade lemonade was way too sweet.  Asked for lemonade in a togo cup at the end and server just tossed an empty cup/lid on table.

Never again Lo-Lo's."}
{"text":"Waited almost 2 hours for a seat. The manager was rude when we told him we needed a spot for our friends baby stroller/baby when this was originally requested when we put our reservation in. My wife had ordered the Shrimp Mac n Cheese and it was WAY too cheesy and tasted horrible. Our other friend ordered the biscuits and gravy but the biscuit was rock hard. 

Compile all that with the music so loud that you can barely hear your friends talk and it made for quite an unpleasant night out for dinner. 

Based on all the other reviews/complaints about this manager I'm shocked that the owners of this place haven't done something already. 

Save your money and go to Liberty Market, Zinburger, Postinos, Joyride or Joe's BBQ instead."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband because we thought the chicken and waffles were going to be good. WRONG! The waffles were soggy and soft and not hot. The chicken was not good AT ALL and I actually think it wasn't cooked all the way as well! I'd rather eat Popeye's Chicken than this chicken. The only decent thing was the Kool-Aid and hello?!?..it's freakin' Kool-Aid. ANYONE CAN MAKE KOOL-AID. Will not be coming back. Not even worth all the hype."}
{"text":"First of all Kool Aid on tap deserves it's own star!!! Our food was delicious, our food came out fast, and the service was great! What else could you possibly want from a restaurant?!"}
{"text":"Roman was our waiter and he is what I am giving the 5 stars for. Very friendly and attentive.  

The fried chicken was good however I didn't want a waffle and asked for fries instead and apparently substitutions are not allowed. The fried green tomatoes were excellent. 

The music in the restaurant was extremely loud and I'm not sure what they had the thermostat set to but I was sweating during the entire meal."}
{"text":"We didn't even make it to a table. Father's Day morning. We put our name on the list (45 minute wait... fair enough) and stepped to the side out of the way. We were then informed by a hostess that we needed to wait outside in the blazing heat because being in front of their display case (which had some gnarly looking shit on display... it looked worse than Waffle House) is a fire hazard. ???? F you. Off we went to eat somewhere else. Bye, Felicia."}
{"text":"When this location opened up, my friends hyped it up big time. I'm a HUGE lover of chicken and waffles. I always went to Hash House for mine and I expected the chicken and waffles to be way better since the restaurant is known for chicken and waffles.

The chicken was too crispy for me. The waffles are very flat and not toasted enough. One of my friends thought of it as KFC fried chicken with Lego My Ego waffles.

The GUEST SERVICING here was amazing though. They were friendly, catered to me periodically, and the kool-aid is DELICIOUS. If there's anything I'd come back here for is for the kool-aid, definitely."}
{"text":"Meh? I don't know, maybe I have had enough of this type of over the top food.  Service was friendly and attentive. The place was mostly empty around 6pm on a Friday. Nice outdoor deck.  Fried green tomatoes were pretty good.  Their namesake dish? It's some ok fried chicken on top of some ok waffles served with watered down maple syrup. Nothing life changing. The menu is more TGI Friday's than soul food.  

Beware the \"Drank\".  Tastes like something you would give to a toddler in a sippy cup but it's got a kick.  I  ended up walking around Gilbert for 90 minutes to sober up after drinking one little 8oz glass of the stuff."}
{"text":"Thanks again for delicious breakfast !! Shared KK'S with a friend...Great service, and love Maurice , always awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The appetizers (fried zucchini and onion rings) were flavorless.  The chicken and waffles were excellent! Blue Cheese Hamburger was very good!  The server had what we felt was an innaprpriatecshirt on, especially for families and asked if we really wanted all of our change back because he didn't have enough."}
{"text":"Came during trip to Vegas and decided to stop before heading out of town.  Took at least 15 minutes to place a to-go order, then another 45 min to get our order with no sorry's; which delayed our trip back home by more than an hr.  However, food was good which why I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday celebration with a larger party (15). Of course we all arrived at separate times, and as one of the first to arrive it took nearly 10 minutes before someone came to take a drink order. Once everyone arrived and our order was placed it took 45 minutes for the food to arrive. You'd think with that much time they'd have things right, but:
-one order had a hamburger, ordered medium rare which was served medium well
-one order had hash browns that were so overcooked they resembled rocks
-one order included sausage and was given bacon
-several of the chicken orders were EXCEPTIONALLY dry (and this is supposedly what they are known for)
-the majority of the orders were barely room temperature (including mine-shrimp and grits which had good flavor but was so cold it  was barely palatable-taking it home, maybe it will be better tomorrow?)

And we have just arrived at the dessert portion, where the two birthday teens would have enjoyed some cake, but apparently they are COMPLETELY out of dessert?

The friendliness of the staff (though only moderately attentive) and the fact that the beers were cold has merited them 1 star. 

Won't be returning..."}
{"text":"After driving by many times since it opened I decided to join family for a late lunch. 2pm on a Saturday and the wait was an hour. After waiting an hour to get a seat the service was horrible! It took another hour to get 3 appetizers out and we kept getting told that our food was \"in the window\" and should be out soon. If soon is another 30 minutes?! A total of 3.5 hours for chicken and waffles is completely ridiculous!!! If I wasn't with family I would have walked out. I will NEVER come back and will make sure to tell everyone I know to avoid this place. Surprised they are still in business! The food wasn't even that great...average at best. It always looks busy because the same customers sit for hours waiting for their food. They even gave us some crap excuse about eggs and sandwiches taking longer to make than just chicken and waffles. How stupid do you think we are?! Definitely lost me as a customer!! Wish I could give them 0 stars!!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Had the Betty Boob with iced tea.  It had pretty good taste and flavor.  Chicken was pretty dry though.   Waffle was great.  Great waitress.   I would try them again but not right at opening.   Maybe get a moist piece of chix next time."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken hand down great but dinner the green beans and dirty rice taste like a whole lot of slap ya moma creol seasoning stick with chicken and breakfast"}
{"text":"So, after getting a reservation here for the first time I decided I would look through the yelp reviews on this place as it was new. I was shocked to see so many one and two star reviews. I let the other people in my party (there were 6 of us) know what I had read, but we decided to give it a try anyway. 

It was Saturday night at 7 o'clock, so I would expect that there would be a long wait. They got us in 35 minutes after I made the reservation. Not too bad considering how busy all of the restaurants were on the street. We sat down and took a while to figure out what we wanted, since there are so many things on the menu. After we made our selection the waitress was very nice and kept checking in on us and filling our drinks and such. All six of us had our food come out at the same time, about 30 minutes after ordering. Again, for how busy it was and from the terrible news I had read I was surprised to get my food in less than an hour and a half. Not only did we get our food in about 30 minutes, but the waitress gave us each an extra waffle and apologized for how long it took. Again, none of us noticed that it had taken very long at all and when I checked my watch it was only about 30 minutes. At the end, she apologized again and let us know the drinks were comped. None of us had complained or acted like they were slow. 

There was a gentleman next to us that was seated with his family about 10 minutes after us and received his food before us. While we were waiting for our check he started complaining on and on to us about how terribly slow the service was. But it seemed like he waited until the waitress was around to complain about it. It was almost as if he was wanting her to comp his meal or something. Again, he sat down after us and got his food before us so it couldn't have been more than a 20 minute wait (on a Saturday Night). 

I'm not saying that no one has actually had a bad experience here, but I felt like I needed to post our experience. The food was probably a four out of five, but I had really high expectations. But the service was so good that they get a five star review for me."}
{"text":"This place is sinfully delicious and the service is excellent. I got a DD plate and it was amazing. The server was fun too. I will be back."}
{"text":"An hour wait to get in, more than 30 minute wait for food.  Twice server came over and said it was coming right out, but it didn't.  \"Explosion\" waffle was burnt and tough, child's grilled cheese sandwich was a piece of cheese on a piece of toasted bread...cheese wasn't even melted. French toast w/bananas foster sauce was cold and when the sauce was poured on, it just kind of congealed on the plate.  Management tried to compensate for the food, offering something different, one person took advantage...Not going back...it's overpriced for what you get, Eggo waffles are as good...very disappointed.  Also, music was WAY TOO LOUD.  We were told earlier in the da you could use an app to get your name in before you arrived...called later to find out how to do that...the person that answered said they didn't do that anymore...got to the restaurant, mentioned the app, the hosting staff said they did still do it...need to communicate with the staff."}
{"text":"The service at this location is terrible. I gave 2 stars because I do like LoLo's food, but service alone would be 1star. The way this place is run is just so unorganized. Several times I've gone there and they have run out of stuff; today I called to place a to-go order, and they aren't taking to-go orders bc they ran out of boxes. This location really needs to get with it, and hire managers who actually know how to run a restaurant. Running out of stuff should not happen as often as it happens at this place, I don't care how busy you are. I've never experienced these types of issues with other restaurants that are just as busy as this one. Seriously, you guys need to get it together or you're going to start losing business. I don't even go there as often as I would if you guys had better service and were more organized. Such a shame too bc the food is good, but service matters a great deal too if you want to keep a good reputation and repeat customers. P.S-there is a reason why this location has the lowest rating...the service sucks!"}
{"text":"Waited an unusually long time  to be seated while employees joked about. There were almost no customers present.   Waited at least 20 minutes for food. Half of our parties eggs, gravy and waffles were cold and gravy cooagulted. Our server was pleasant, but overall it was a very lame experience . We came here on a reccomendation. But I certainly won't reccomend it."}
{"text":"My family and I just ate here for the first time.  We were pleasantly surprised!  We were welcomed, seated and greeted by our server quickly.  Roman was helpful when we asked for suggestions,  he was extremely attentive, interacted in a fun/joking way with our kiddo and he was entertaining to watch as he danced a bit and socialized with other customers.  The food came quick.  We all had something different and it was all really good!  We can't wait to come back and also looking forward to trying out their breakfast."}
{"text":"What can I say, I loved this place. My son and I decided to try it out one afternoon, and it was still quiet, so we got sat right away. Nice booth seats near the bar. Service was very good. Everybody was friendly, and on the ball. 

I loved the fried chicken, crisp, but not overly done so, and not greasy, but the chicken itself was juicy and good. (I ordered the Betty's Boob!) We also got a side of collared greens and green bean/potatoes and shared those. Collared greens were not mush like some places make them, but nice and fresh and a little bit of a zip/zest to them. As were the green beans. My son got himself some fried okra and it was tasty. 

Unlike the other heathens posting, I LOVED the cinnamon in the waffles. Made them delish! Granted, I am partial to cinnamon in most things, but I thought it made the waffles very tasty. 

We drank some sweet tea, atho, down the road, I plan on getting some koolaid on tap. haha. 

All in all good experience. I can't wait to see what happens once the bar opens us (I wanna try the Purplesaurus Rex!) And I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I were at the airport location last night and decided to try Lo Lo's.  We both ordered the Catfish platter.  He got collared greens and red beans and rice for his sides.  He enjoyed all of it!  
I ordered Mac n cheese and potato salad.  The guy at the register assured me that it was \"way better than Joe's Real BBQ\" (their competitor next door).  I was shocked when I found the Mac n cheese was made with cream of mushroom soup.  It's ALL I could taste, completely overpowering...nothing cheesy about it.  I couldn't even stomach it.  The potato salad was OK, just a bit too sweet for my tastes."}
{"text":"Disappointing from beginning to end.  We were seated quickly (Sunday evening crowd was a bit light) but were ignored for 5 minutes before our drink order was taken.  Another 5 mins and a passing waitress came by and said she'd noticed we had been there for a while.  She went and grabbed the drinks that were sitting on the bar warming up.  Bless her for noticing.  
Food arrived and we found it to be mediocre at best.  Nothing special about the waffles and though the chicken seemed to be borderline overdone the fried batter was good."}
{"text":"To damn slow!! Terrible service. The food was fine. Won't  go back! 
This is not the first time on this"}
{"text":"Horrible.  2 hour wait on a Wednesday.  Either they don't have enough staff because there is certainly enough space to do 2 to 3 turns for dinner or they just don't care.  I am going with they don't care because the hostesses were quite rude and honestly this place will not last in gilbert with this kind of customer service and 2 plus hour waits on a weekday.  That's just crazy.  Get it together Lo lo's.  It has been plenty of time for you guys to iron out the kinks."}
{"text":"Overall I would give this place 4 stars. Catfish is AWESOME. Chicken wasn't too bad. Koolaid was tooo sweet. 

Service 3 stars: we had to wait about 15-20 mins to be acknowledge but Tasha was kind enough to notice and  step up to the plate and take our orders. She kept coming around checking up on us making sure everything was good. Not everyone in my party was doing ok. 

**Expect about a 30 min wait for food to come after they placed your orders."}
{"text":"This was the first time my wife and I ate a lolo's and will be the last. The food is decent and the atmosphere is good, however customer service is sub-par. We ordered Oreo pancakes for both our children to share, however they did not eat the pancake because it was too sweet. When we told our server our children did not like the pancake, he left and came back a few mins later and said they would still have to charge us for the pancake $13. I've been to other restaurants and this has never been an issue. They offered to substitute the pancake for something else, but we didn't want anything else. Again, many other restaurants this would not have been an issue, however this experience left a bad taste in my opinion about dollar over customer satisfaction. This is not good customer service or anyway to run a business."}
{"text":"Was there last night with my family for dinner, it did not seem busy, there were a few tables opened. We were seated right away however the night got worse, we sat there about 15 minutes or so before we were approached by a server, she took our drink order, the server brought some drinks and forgot the one at the bar, my spouse had to go up and get it himself. We sat there another 15 minutes or so before another server approached us and asked if our order was taken, we advised him no, he took our order and informed us the the server that was assigned to us was new. We waited a very long time to get our order, when it finally got to us it was incorrect and had to be fixed of course it was my granddaughters, my dinner was not fresh, nor was my spouses. I was going to talk with a manager but could not find our server and many servers were standing around or at the bar talking and several servers were also standing around the hostess station not caring about prompt service, many customers were waiting for a server. We were ready to get out of there, if this is how this establishment is going to run then they need to move on and let something else takes it place By the way the stuffed French toast was horrible and hard as a rock. We have been there 3 times and this will be the last!!!!"}
{"text":"Finding places my whole family can eat is a challenge, but this place is great!  Breakfast all day, good southern food, and you can even just order sides.  The portions are huge so whatever you get will fill you up!  Fried Okra and Grits were fantastic, even my picky eaters liked the chicken and waffles!  The service was great and the manager was going around to say hello.  Hope this place stays awhile because we will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious 4 stars..I understand they just opened we waited 30-40 min to be seated another 10-15 min to get our drinks had to ask someone who our server was no one had a answer..my date had to go find the manager to get some help once that was taken care of we finally got service staff is friendly...will definable go back"}
{"text":"We got the koolade and the next day both were throwing up no need for so much sugar If I go to the hospital for this they are,getting sued"}
{"text":"Soggy waffles and bland unseasoned, dry chicken. Far from the experiences I've had at the Phoenix location. I hope they figure it out soon.

Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Had been waiting with much anticipation for Lolos to open in Gilbert.  My husband and I  decided to go this morning for breakfast.  Place was busy but not full.  When we walked in we were asked if we wanted inside or outside seating.  We said inside.  Hostess asked if we minded a high top, we said yes because we thought there were no other tables available.  When we sat down, we noticed that there were plenty of tables to choose from.  A server came about ten minutes later to take our drinks order, we asked for one decaf and two waters.  Waters came about ten minutes later, no coffee.  We placed our food order, server said he would have coffee right out.  About 15 minutes later we catch the server, ask him about the coffee again and he says there are no clean cups for the coffee, he didn't know how long it would take to get our coffee.  What kind of restaurant does not have enough coffee cups if you serve breakfast and the place isn't even full? We noticed there were lots of people waiting outside, there were about 8 tables open inside and some more outside, why weren't they seating people???  We were there close to forty minutes and couldn't get a darn cup of coffee, ridiculous.  This is not their first location, why so unprepared?  I'm a very patient person but I could tell that it wasn't going to be a very good experience.  Will not try again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love the food, and be prepared to wait as this place is very popular.  I have had mixed experiences with service, but its been generally good.  

The waffles here are sweet and delicious, as is the chicken.  The portions are pretty big - often my wife and I will split a meal and then order an additional side to share between us (the bacon mac n cheese is amazing!)."}
{"text":"On Thursday June 25, 2015 my husband and I met my sister and her family for dinner at Lolo's.  My husband and I had been here before and weren't impressed, but my sister had not so we agreed to try it again.  I ordered an omelet that was supposed to come with a biscuit and home fries.  I only received half of my order.  The home fries were never brought to the table despite numerous requests.  I kept getting told that everything was made to order and they forgot to make them.  The home fries were not an add on or a side order.  The menu indicated they were included with my omelet.  I was later brought a basket of french fries and the served tried to charge me for them.  She later removed the charge for the french fries, which I did not order, and then expected me to pay the full $14.00 for my omelet even though I never received the home fries that were supposed to be included in the meal.  There was no apology and only after I explained that I only received half of my meal did the manager take a whopping $4.00 off of my bill.  I will never go back to Lolo's.  There are way too many good options in downtown Gilbert to spend my money at this restaurant that has terrible service."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday and I gotta say......this place was amazing . The food was great, the portions size was huge but, I would have to say the best part of my experience was the staff (Our waiter). This dude was awesome.......oh yea......the coolaid was on point."}
{"text":"Decided to take my family to the new location in Gilbert. Absolutely love the Scottsdale location and their employees, always friendly upbeat and excellent food. 

Gilbert location was a total let down, arrived about 5:30pm on a Wednesday night and told it would be 45- 60 minutes for a table. New place wait time was acceptable so we put or name in, an HOUR AND 45 minutes later we were shown to our table outside on the patio after specifically stating we wanted a table inside. Hostess was nice enough to find us a place inside. I was suprised to see at least four open tables inside with no one sitting at them and a full waiting area.  

It was a little chilly outside when we went and several people were standing inside the doorway and to the side of the hostess stand to keep warm. Could not believe when I observed the manager walk over to a group of older ladies one of which who was sitting on a chair and asked them to wait outside, and then took the chair the lady was sitting on and removed it from the area. Only to have other customers walk in and stand in the same place and not one word said to them to move.

Had a great waitress Morgan who came right over and took our order and very quickly stated the kitchen was behind and our fod would take about 45 minutes. So its now 7:30 family is starving and we order, about 8:30 the food arrives. 

The food was delicious as always and Morgan was always around checking on us to see if we needed anything.  

Overall a great place to eat, manager or whoever you were sahem on you for being so rude to the old ladies, Morgan rock on sister your a great waitress!"}
{"text":"Food was great - service was stellar.   Lorenzo was very attentive, made great recommendations and made the experience a positive one for my family.  

Thanks!"}
{"text":"Food was good, big portions, but service wasn't the best. There was a long wait for no apparent reason. I would give them another try though."}
{"text":"first off i just want to say our server did a very good job and i had no problems with the service. my main problems with this place was that my food was terrible and that in the waiting area by the front of the restaurant they have a cold case displaying deserts that had moldy and rotten fruit as garnish, that should have tipped me off to how the food would be but i guess that was my mistake. The shrimp and grits i ordered seemed half cooked and cold, there was some kind of batter/breading on the shrimp that was sorta crisp on the outside but mostly gooey on the inside...it was really gross."}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times now and this time, last night was mediocre at best.  The chicken was dryed out and overcooked.  Flavors were bland.  Burnt the inside of my mouth with an extremely hot piece of catfish.   Unpleasant at best and not coming back.

The first couple of times the food was outstanding so things have dropped off fast there.

Too bad."}
{"text":"Other than they brought us cheesy grits we didn't order everything was amazing. Food was hot and tasty. Our server was very attentive and friendly. We waited literally 2 minutes for a table and got our food 15 minutes after we ordered. Not sure if things have improved vastly since some of these poor reviews were posted but my experience was exceptional."}
{"text":"I met a friend at Lolos today and I was disappointed. I guess if you like crispy crispy overcooked and dry chicken that would be a good place for you but I don't really like overcooked chicken it's probably because it was fried deep-fried? But the waffles were excellent! The service was great and the atmosphere was nice I would go there only if I wanted to eat the waffles"}
{"text":"We waited in line for 40 mintes to get a table. Then we waited 30 minutes for someone to wait on us. We asked the busser who our waiter was, he did not know, but would find out. He came back and said he did not know. So we left. On our way out we asked to speak to a manager and was told we'd have to wait in line for that too. The couple next to us left for the same reason. The customer service here is aweful. The people at the other table told us the service was super slow after they had their order taken too. DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO WASTE."}
{"text":"My wife and I were riding our daily bike ride and we decided to stop in to try the place, it was about 3:30 pm so that was good to avoid the crowd, and it took about 20 min to get our order and the waiter was the bomb,very helpful and made some suggestions as well, we got the Lo Lo'special and a house salad,it was very good except for the syrup was thick and sticky,but the chicken was perfect, not salty and greasy,so overall it was a good dining experience for us first timers."}
{"text":"Yo this is my spot 10th time here I love it can't wait till they get #hustlewater there the wait is short the food is good and I leave happy every time s/o to the host tiffany she should be a waitress"}
{"text":"My boyfriends order was messed up and all we asked was for was it to be sent back and remade which they did with no hesitation. Jes the manager later came up to the table and personally  apologize for the food being messed up and took care of us. It was totally unexpected and the sweetest thing I'll definitely be back here Jes the manager and Brianna the server provided excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"The food was great. The atmosphere was comfortable.  We had no problem with the wait times. But then again, I will wait for good food. The shrimp Mac and cheese is delicious! Huge serving.  The fried chicken is crispy and juicy. Overall very happy with meal."}
{"text":"Long time Gilbert resident, notice this place since it opened. Originally from California where Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles is famously known. Never thought chicken and waffles sounded good. My wife tried it and she really liked it. We actually went back a second time. I ordered the breakfast burrito and the chorizo the second visit. Food was surprisingly delish, some thing different, will definitely go back. Service does need to be addressed, I would recommend place for food, atmosphere, good luck with the service."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken tenders and waffle basket. The chicken tenders were juicy- but my issue is more with the waffle. It was a tad under done for my taste and covered in butter. 

I also ordered the fried green tomatoes- they were delicious. I was hoping that the chicken would have the same coating as the tomatoes, but they didn't. 

I'd come again, but I'd probably trying the normal breakfast and stay away from the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 7 people. We rsvp'd for 10am, so we didn't have to wait. I ordered the shrimp mac n cheese. The flavor was good and the cheese was very creamy. It was a little on the greasy side, maybe because of the bits of bacon in it? I also ordered a side of chicken. I was disappointed because the skin was overdone; however the meat was moist. I tried some of the waffles from my friend, but it was soft and soggy. With that said, they need to have those 2 items perfect if that's in the name of their restaurant. On the bright side, our waitress was very attentive and cheerful."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night at about 5:30 pm so there were only a couple other tables filled when we got there. Service was fine although we stood at the hostess stand a bit too long before she realized we were there. I got the #5 which is a breast, wing and 1 waffle. The waffle was very tasty (can you go wrong with a waffle? I hope not), but the chicken was so dry I was choking it down. Neither the meat nor the breading had any flavor either. Same for my boyfriend's chicken sandwich with side waffle, so dry. Wanted to try this place out finally but now probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Long wait and then wait much longer for your food. The staff seems to be over worked. Mix ups at reception. Staff working in kitchen looked overwhelm. Finally got my food; Chorizo & Eggs w/side of tortillas. What?! Out of tortillas? Instead Hawaiian sweet bread? Where is the salsa? What?! Don't serve salsa? Tried a piece of their \"famous\" chicken; it's nothing to write home about. For the money, I would get a bucket of KFC, be more satisfied and have leftovers. May be in a few months they'll catch their \"groove\". Until then, I will try other venues along Gilbert Road before returning to  \"Locos\" chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"If i could give them zero stars i would. Went in on a Sunday morning, early enough to beat the church crowd. Walked in, no one greeted me. A bunch of girls standing around the register looking like they were deep in convo and couldn't be bothered. I approached and said ide like to order take out. One girl handed me a menu and very dryly told me to have a seat. I sat at a nearby bench and made my choice, went back to the register and started to place my order. After i was done talking, another girl told me that they dont do take out, so i will have to sit down at a table, order my food, box it, and then leave. So i asked if i could sit anywhere, they said yes. I walked over to the bar and as im turning around, the girls are all snickering as if im the one with the problem. I ordered my food with the bartender telling him ide like white meat only (chicken and waffles with grits) with a fruit punch koolaide. The bartender tells me that there are no substitutions but points out another meal similar to what I'm asking for. Its more expensive but i agree and continue (i know i should've left at that point but i was hungry and hungover). No coffee or water offered to me btw, after all i AM dining in right?? Wrong! The food comes out pretty quickly (questionable but no real complaint there) and the bartender and i start boxing it together. No gloves or sanitizer, just boxing my food up. It wasn't until i was in the car when i realized that the koolaide was extremely watery and when i got home i see gave me a thigh instead of breast like I had asked and paid extra for. I absolutely hate dark meat. I didn't bother calling to complain because something told me that my concerns wouldn't have been met anyway. Instead I've decided to leave a very honest yet opinionated review. Avoid this place if you can. Even if the service is great and you get what you ordered, the food itself is mediocre, the drink was bland, and it was super overpriced. Not worth the 23$, i couldve gone to the grocery store and made my own grits with chicken and waffles for half the price."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst restaurant and most overpriced chicken I have ever seen. The restaurant just opened up and so out of curiosity we wanted to go check it out. We spent $130 for some chicken and a few drinks apiece. Completely blown away. The service was horrible as well. I am not exaggerating when I say that KFC is better chicken then this place. The waffles were literally the worst waffles I have ever eaten. I will never understand why Gilbert allow this restaurant to come to town. We do not recommend this place to anybody ever!"}
{"text":"I wasn't so sure about it at first but to my surprise the food was amazing and the service was terrific."}
{"text":"Easily one of the worst meals we've had here in Vegas. I should give zero stars but considering one of the front end employees acknowledged our complaints I'm giving one.

We came in on a Thursday evening and there's only one other table including ours. We ordered fried chicken and waffles and it came out a little too quickly which I thought was odd. But right off the bat we noticed the chicken was too brown - basically burnt. Not only was it burnt but it was beyond dry. I had one thigh that was somewhat edible. The mac and cheese was so chewy and dry it tasted like it was sitting under a heating lamp. 

When our check came and noticed how much we would paying for an inedible meal, we talked to our server about it. She apologized and said \"most days the chicken is golden but for some reason today I noticed the darker color.\" What?? The fact that she even noticed and and still served it to us is crazy. She spoke to someone about our complaint and offered a 10% discount. 

As we were leaving the front end employee asked how everything was and by both mine and my wife's \"okay\" she kindly wanted to address the issue. She said she would talk to the kitchen and has mentioned to them before that when it is slow food should be made cooked-to-order (duh.) She wanted us to give them a second chance but honestly we probably wouldn't considering the price of the food. She also told us they were having a re-grand opening tomorrow and all I could think was that they're not off to a very good 2nd start. I told her if the kitchen staff wouldn't eat dry and burnt chicken themselves, it shouldn't be on the plate. Period. Should have went with the yelp reviews and avoided this place altogether."}
{"text":"Worst experience we have had in a long time.  Extremely long wait ( 1 hour) to receive food which came out at different times and 1 of the meals had to be returned.  (This dish was delivered 10 minutes before the rest of the meals)

Previous experience was a little slow, but we decided to give it another shot as we are big fans of the food.  Will not return and hope for future customers that appropriate staffing and attention to detail are addressed.  First time for a review, but really felt compelled to do so after this visit.

Several tables next to us were having similar experiences."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Lo-Lo's Gilbert tonight. I cannot believe the level of service we received this evening. There was hair in our food and our chicken was uncooked. The pink substance on the plate pictured was oozing out of the chicken. 4 out of our 6 meals contained under cooked chicken and our cornbread had hair in it! I am disgusted and embarrassed. We were hosting relatives from Michigan and we bragged about how great Lo-Lo's was despite what my sister read about the Las Vegas location."}
{"text":"I have come to this LoLo's several times and while many reviews on here are bad - I've had great experiences here. I always get the chicken tender and waffle combo (can't recall the name) but it's literally a few tenders and one of their yummy waffles. The chicken tenders are some of the best I've ever had with great seasoning and flavor. LOVE their ranch dipping sauce as well. I've also gotten their French fries and they are to die for good! I love the blue koolaid with half Sprite.. Seriously give it a try it's amazing. While the wait for the food is usually longer than I'd like what can you expect for a location that is so busy. Fun atmosphere for a group dinner."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  The food was good and plenty but the meal took over an hour.  We asked to speak to the manager on duty and she never came to our table.  Do not go there if you expect service"}
{"text":"What an awesome experience at Lo Lo's! From the time we walked in, our waiter, Roman was AWESOME. He had a big smile and was so attentive. We were a large group and he catered to our every need, individually. It was as if we were having dinner with family, not in a restaurant. This is my first trip to the Phoenix area, and what a great 1st impression. Roman, keep up the good work. You are AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. Loved the combination of chicken & waffles... but no where near the best chicken or the best waffles I've had. Side dishes are just too greasy... big pool of oil sitting atop a mac/cheese. Great wait staff - food was Denny-esque."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very stylish and has brand new furnishings with a beautiful bar. The seating seems slightly cramped and the music is pretty loud. There are alot of screaming and crying children and you can tell from the food and debris on seats and floor, we had to wipe our table and seats off. The waitress was fast and friendly  but the cook was extremely slow it took 30 + minutes to get our food which was a little over cooked (chicken)and not as good as I was hoping."}
{"text":"The food was great!!! The service was awful!!! I went with my family and it took the hostess 10 minutes to even notice us. Should would of noticed us but was too busy on her phone. When we asked for a booth she was rude and rolled her eyes. Finally we got sat in the patio.. worst mistake ever!!! They forgot about us. !! I had to ask someone to come take my order. Once food arrived no once did the cone check on us. I had to get up again and ask for extra napkins, silverware, refill and for my check. The food was the only good thing about it. Won't go back and deff won't recommend it"}
{"text":"First timer. 
One star for the Sarah our nice waitress. Spunky and sweet. One star for the music.

My fiancée catfish was tasteless, red beans and rice was beans and tomato sauce. 
My dirty rice was yummy. Smothered chicken was ok. 

Service was a little slow 
More than likely not retuning."}
{"text":"What an enjoyable breakfast! Mimosa was made with a splash of fresh squeezed OJ! Coffee was even delicious. Grits were good. I like my waffles crispy, this one lacked such pizzazz (order it well done next time) but was still delicious. Eggs cooked to perfection. Crispy, plump chicken breast. Biscuits and gravy on point! And great service! Would go back to try appetizers & full service bar around lunch time!"}
{"text":"Wait time was 20 minutes very busy food place food was good and they even have Kool-aid of all flavors."}
{"text":"This is my spot when Im craving fried chicken and waffles.  Well today I had my daughter and neighbor(never been so I wanted him to enjoy it) with me.  Host told us to sit where ever.  Says your server will be right with you.  15 minutes!!!! Went by and was dead inside four servers chatting away at the bar looking at us.  My daughter was starving by this time.  We saw two other tables get drinks and orders down.  So we walked out and your guy host with the glasses had the audacity to say \"have a nice day\"  you just sat us and don't remember.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I've given this place 4 tries and it's unimpressive. The fried chicken has no taste. The seasoning is completely missing. I need fried chicken to have seasoning! 

The biscuits and gravy was underwhelming, while the waffles are just okay. I just don't know what to make of this place. They need to at least change the cooks. After 4 separate visits, this eatery is not having an adjustment period, it's failing to reach the basic mark of tasty food. 

The one bright spot here is the service is excellent. The servers are attentive and friendly. Unfortunately, that's not enough to overcome the bland taste of the food."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Lolo's Scottsdale before but our first time in the Gilbert location.  One of the reasons why we have not tried this location until now, is most of the people that we know who's tried this location have not had good experience.  And that was true to us when we dined at this location.  Our server was very nice and helpful but the manager on duty (I didn't get her name but she's the pregnant manager) was very rude and couldn't care less if we left and never come back.  We were a big group and by the time I have arrived with my son, everybody had already placed their order and/or are already eating.  My son has a lot of food allergies and because I assumed there is nothing at Lolo's that he can eat, I brought him some fries from In and Out.  My son is 3 years old and that's pretty much what he can enjoy.  As I sat and joined our group, this pregnant manager walked by and in passing just said \"He can't eat outside food here.\"  Because I realized she wouldn't give us the time of her day, I decided to approach her and just explained our situation.  She was very rude, wouldn't even look at me and kept cutting me off.  The worst thing she said was, \"You know your child has allergies, you shouldn't be bringing him in a restaurant like this.\"  I have had to talk to managers regarding my son's food allergies and almost all (if not ALL) of them will allow my son to eat the food that we brought because they can not guarantee that the food that they serve is allergy safe for him.  If our group has not started eating yet, I would have left.  I actually asked the manager if we should just leave and never eat here.  She said, \"I didn't say that, but that's your choice.\"  Wow!  We do not need businesses and people like this in Gilbert!  I understand her point of no outside food allowed, but I didn't need to be treated that way.  Eventually, because I did not want my son and I to leave and find a different place to eat dinner without our group, I asked specifically of anything in their menu that they can cook and guarantee that it would be allergen free.  The same manager had to confirm that one of the grill was already cleaned out (because this was close to closing time) and that's the only reason why/how they were able to cook anything for my son. 
Just an fyi...here's an article on the allergylawproject.com regarding federal guidelines for public places like restarurants: \"Many venues that offer food for sale are considered to be places of public accommodation pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act and therefore must be accessible to all. See 42 U.S.C. § 12181. Restaurants, zoos, movie theaters, gymnasiums, amusement parks, and sports stadiums are considered places of public accommodation under federal and often state law. See 42 U.S.C. §12181; 28 C.F.R. § 36.104. Therefore, these entities must make modifications to permit individuals with disabilities to have full and equal access unless doing so would create an undue burden, a fundamental alteration, or a direct threat to health or safety. See 28 C.F.R. § 36.302.\""}
{"text":"If you never want coffee refills, syrup for your pancakes, or your full order... this is the place for you. We asked 4 waiters plus the manager for coffee refills and after 30 mins were told they ran out of coffee. Food was great. Our breakfast for 4 was $70 and we left a tip of $3.50. It was that bad.
 
If you want lolos food...go to their Scottsdale location where the service matches the food."}
{"text":"This place needs a new manager, wait staff and kitchen staff! Epic fail in all 3 areas. The bartender was even an idiot. We had a large group, party of 11, waited an hour to be seated, which we expected. The drinks from the bar had no alcohol, our food was really really late. Some in our group finished eating before others food even arrived.  They brought out the same meal twice, which was wrong- we could do nothing but laugh at that point. The manager was clueless- said he would give us a discount but never did. Our waitress tried really hard but it just didn't work. Save your time and money, go to a different place. This restaurant shouldn't be open at this point with the level of inefficient staff and management."}
{"text":"Website says they open up at 8am on Fridays. We arrived at 8 and the hostess was not friendly, and said they do not open until 9am.  I ordered a menu item that is served in one of their Phoenix locations and it was completely different. Food is good, but not as good as the location in Phoenix. The server was excellent, but the hostess needs to refine their service skills."}
{"text":"First timer. Also wish the waffles were crisp and the chicken needs seasoning. Server Tiny was darling."}
{"text":"It was our first and last visit this past Saturday at lunch time... Not good and over priced...Don't waste your time and money. The food took 1/2hr to get after we ordered. The chicken was good but no better than kfc or frys.  The waffles really fell short. They were very thin and tasted like a frozen eggo. So for $47.00 we got 5 pieces of chicken two waffles and two drinks."}
{"text":"First of all, let me preface this review with the fact that I do understand mistakes are made and also that I did request service at the busiest time, Sunday morning, but I don't think that's an unreasonable request... That being said, I didn't mind the 35 minute wait to get a table. Again, it is expected. After we were sat, our server made his way to our table in a timely fashion , didn't rush our order, and made us feel at home. We sat at our table for 25 minutes and got a round of refills on our non alcoholic drinks and our server made no mention of the food so we assumed it should be close to done. We assumed wrong. At about the 35 minute mark our server came over and let us know that \"We're almost there!\". I started to notice people that were sat after us were eating. At 45 minutes I noticed a family that had arrived at the host/hostess station when we were being sat getting their entrees.. at the Grand Total of 52 minutes I decided to throw in the towel. I got up from my table and went to let somebody know that I wouldn't wait any longer for my order. Amazingly, this was coincidentally the point at which they had managed to cook my order of 6 pancakes, 2 waffles, and 2 chicken breasts in all. I told them I had been waiting 50 minutes for my food and that I was not going to pay full price for it and, in fact, had lost my appetite in the amount of time it took for them to get my order together. I wouldn't be writing this review if the 16 year old food runner wouldn't have been standing there with a smirk on his face asking me if this was my order repeatedly. I wouldn't be writing this review if the female server with no prior knowledge of the situation wouldn't have jumped into the conversation asking what table we were at with a look of disbelief on her face as if I was lying about my experience. Nobody cared that we sat there for almost an hour before they mustered up the competence to make a simple order for 4 people and that is not a business I will support, nor do I want in my community seeing as I live less than a mile from this establishment. Terrible. Insufferable. And rude. Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles should be ashamed of the \"service\" provided regardless if I'm one customer or not."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. I think that the previous reviews were a little harsh due to the fact they have only been open over a month now. My bartender Nick was awesome and what a great personality. I was seated in about thirty minutes. My server Kyle also was entertaining and took great care of us. We ate a huge tasty meal followed by a red velvet cake! Yum! Food did not take as long as some said but that's probably because the restaurant is settling in. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place would have gotten a zero if zero's were possible. The catfish was mediocre.. the chicken in the supposed \"award winning\" phat azz samwich was gross, it was just a chicken breast dipped like 4 times in cornmeal.. nothing mind blowing about it. The fries.. mediocre as well the sweet tea sucked and the service was so bad I didn't leave a tip. Considering there is chicken in the name of this place... you would think you could safely assume that everything chicken would be at least decent... not the case here... it was such a disappointment. Save your money go to Raising  Canes and make your own waffle at home.."}
{"text":"Ordered Tre-Tre's & Betty's Boob plus the melon mojito and jar of drank (sweet tea) 

All were delicious! Came on a Saturday before lunch hour and we were seated fairly quick. 

Food 5/5
Drinks 5/5 (especially the sweet tea) 
Service 5/5"}
{"text":"Going to keep it short....very bad customer service...delivered the appetizer without sauce and the girl that said she would bring it never did...got our entrée before our appetizer was ready to eat. Food was ok, but too expensive for what it is. Would not return due to the lack of good customer service."}
{"text":"Food was ok but rush cooked. Also waited an hour for table. Then another 40 mins for food to come out. We told waitress to split the bill. We provided two different cards but each ticket was ran on my card only. Never going back."}
{"text":"I went for the first time costumer service was amazing, plates are huge but I was expecting more since a lot of people was saying it was good waffle. It my opinion the waffle didn't have no flavor but if you don't try you won't know. Everyone has different opinions and taste."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome one of the cleanest restaurants I've ever been in. The waitress was personable and knowledgeable and the food was absolutely five star."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit there. It takes no time to get seated but i took the waitress 6 minutes to come take our drink order, another 7 minutes to bring our drinks. I ordered sweet tea. Now maybe it's me but I've NEVER had sweet tea that I had to add sugar to. Since it took that long for drinks, I wanted to see how long it would be for our food, so I put on the timer. It took 30 freaking minutes, but wait we didn't even get to eat. The owner, chef or whomever he was, came out, told us they are not serving food, they have nothing to serve us, that the truck didn't make their delivery today, but yet while he's making the announcement the waitresses are still bringing out drinks. Huh???? In what world does a restaurant run out of food?? We are offered rain checks that they did not have. First and last time there. I see how some businesses to do not last."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating from Lo-Lo's and I was very disappointed. First issue is that the website didn't have prices. No worries, I was still prepared to order and pick up two breakfast entrees. I ordered the banana Caramel pancakes. When I picked up the entree I found it was covered in pecans. Nowhere on the item description did it state that the dish came with nuts. 
My friends order was the Lo-Lo's traditional French toast and his food was burnt. 
All of this for $30 and to add to my annoyance; the receipt doesn't show anywhere what the items cost. Definitely won't be eating from this establishment again"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!!!  I had the Shrimp and Grits and it was totally worth it.  There was so much food I left overs for 2 more meals. The amount of food is totally worth the cost.  Loved the Kool-Aid.  Wished they had Cherry but Fruit Punch was great too. 
I would give 5 stars but our service was VERY slow and our waitress spilled a whole glass of tea on my dad.  But other than that I will totally come back."}
{"text":"Alysia is a great waitress, but our food took over an hour to come out. All of it was cold and Erin the \"regional manager\" couldn't even help resolve the situation. He stormed off from our table several times and nothing was resolved. When the waiter asked him to come back to our table her refused to come to our table. The worst experience I've ever had and I will never visit another location in Phoenix. How do you have a regional manager that can't provided proper customer service and when I asked why he's the regional manager he said simply because he's been there the longest. Maybe Larry should consider placing someone with customer service skills in the position. I wouldn't even send my worst enemy to this location."}
{"text":"We tried getting in to the mexican restaurant next door and with 1/2 the tables empty they said it was a 30 minute wait. So we walked into Lo-Lo's and got seated right away. Felt lucky. Well, we had a very nice waitress but we too sat for 45 minutes with no food. That is unacceptable. Hopefully these are growing pains and the manager/owner will read these Yelps and do something about it. If not, they will not last. Wednesday night at 5:45, 1/4 of the place empty and everyone was waiting too long for food. Why did I give it three stars? Well we were lucky, our food came out perfect - just like Scottsdale location - hot and delicious. I remember the waffles being a bit thicker, but they still tasted good. Come on guys - read your yelps, you are going to lose your customers."}
{"text":"Service was great, but the food nothing special at all. Nowhere near Roscoe's or Dinah's back in LA. Chicken was dry and over cooked. I'll give another shot, hopefully it's better the second time."}
{"text":"This place has great food but the service is horrible.... 45 to an hour wait when there are open tables everywhere... after ordering it took an hour to get my food... I think the staff needs training"}
{"text":"We were waited by Sparky. 

I got a 3 piece  all white meat. My wife got a Hood burger. Sparky was an amazing waiter. He's very personable and humble person. He made my wife and I feel like we were the only couple in the restaurant. We weren't, but he made us feel like it. 

The chicken was very tasty and moist. The greens and mac and cheese was very good, and way better then Roscos. 

My wife said: The hood burger was really good. It was juicy and very flavor-able. 

As far as prices, not expensive in my opinion."}
{"text":"Went here to eat with wife and sister in law the lady to seat us was rude and then told us it be about 15 min to be seated and only two tables being used then she went on to tell us we can only eat chicken and waffles and nothing else I would never step foot in this restaurant or tell anyone to eat here"}
{"text":"Well, that was a disappointing experience. The wait to be seated wasn't too bad after being told an hour and 45 minutes. The waitress could have been more attentive, especially waiting a long while to get our check and waiting for water. The worst part was the $75 check for a couple sets of pancakes, biscuits and gravy, and two pieces of chicken and a single waffle. For food that overly priced, it should have been 10xs better! Also, the sweet tea was awful :( I'm glad I went and tried it but won't be returning."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, Food is mediocre. Had two unpleasant experiences. Will not be returning. Smh"}
{"text":"The chicken was seasoned well, but my husband hated the fries, I didn't like the waffles at all, the home fries arrived cold and hard and my husband said that he makes better kool-aid.  So we won't be back. The Bartender was very friendly and attentive though."}
{"text":"After a stroll at the farmers market at downtown Gilbert.. Thought we go for brunch..the wait was 45 minutes, but was told we can sit by the bar. Right when I sat down, the waitress \"you can't have outside drinks, get it out of here!\" With her catty voice. Its AZ, I carry water or coconut water with me all the time! Placed our order, and 35 minutes into it, havent even gotten our appetizer. We finally asked  her to check our order, she didn't do it until 5 minutes later.  Came back and told us it be 5 more minutes.  10m minutes later still didn't get our food. We ask to see the manager.. Came out and said our food was coming out.. It finally did..so after 55 minutes later we got our food, accept that it wasn't hot.  The waitress never apologised, had the other waitress do her dirty work. The manager should have at least compt our appetizer.. I call it Koo-Koo chicken.. Cause there's a few operating the joint.."}
{"text":"I had heard about LoLo's from friends out of state so was really happy to see one open in my neighborhood. The restaurant was lovely, very nice design- open and airy. I went on a Sunday morning around 11, and although it was full and busy, it wasn't noisy and we didn't feel rushed at all. Everyone that we came in contact with was very nice and accommodating. The waiters were very upbeat and efficient. The service was very speedy and accurate.

Now, to the food. I am really a fan of the waffles. They were prepared just right, vey moist and flavorful. I could go every week just for the waffles. The grits were also perfect, drowning in butter just like I like, and perfectly seasoned. The tea was also perfect. However, the fried chicken was over cooked and dry! I'm hoping it was just a bad day, so I'm willing to try going there again. There are so many things on the menu that I want to try - the catfish, the mac & cheese in particular. I'll write an update if the chicken is better next time because I reeaaaly would like to see this restaurant stay in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is some excellent southern style food. Service is good as well, i had the Soul Food platter fried chicken with fried okra mmmm, dirty rice and corn bread muffin."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat. My man and I got there at  perfect time, no waiting. The chicken was good and seasoned well and the waffle was good. My man had the  grits and shrimp he enjoyed it. Had to wait awhile for the food but was worth it. By the time we left in the evening it was a lot of people waiting."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast there this morning. 25 min. wait. When we did get seated and finally a waitress came to take our order she came back to say the kitchen was very backed up and our order would take longer than normal. Their chicken is good. The place is VERY noisy. Nothing special. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Honestly terrible customer service,  even our server mentioned that he hated this place soo I'm guessing it's not just the guests.  Took over an hour to get a table when we were told 30-40 min.  Then when we finally sat down it took 20 min until someone greeted us and took our order.  Then right after that another person came by to get our order and got confused when we said we already ordered with someone else. When we finally got our food it was okay nothing exceptional,  definitely not worth waiting 2 hours to eat.  Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Super yummy! Hubby had smothered chicken and waffles - he ate it all! I had stuffed french toast - WOW DELISH! Not too sweet - just right!"}
{"text":"Good food with bad service. The last time I went to LoLo's was sort of a let down. First of all, the music that was playing was incredibly loud, then all of a sudden it stopped for the rest of my visit. The floors were littered with crumbs and receipts. I ordered chicken tenders and waffles which was really good and my girlfriend ordered a side of potato salad which was horrible. It had clearly gone bad, as it had a very zesty, zippy taste. Our server, apparently a \"manager\" of some sort, referred to us as \"my man,\" and \"mom,\" which I thought was super unprofessional but I guess that's soul food. Definitely wouldn't recommend eating in. Stick with a to-go order and keep it simple."}
{"text":"Great food but horrible service. There is always a long wait and they handle situations poorly, refusing to believe they had done something wrong."}
{"text":"I went for their soft opening which normally I wouldn't complain because that means free food!  But I never got my food...We went in right at 1pm (when they first started letting people in).  We order the trio (3 apps) and ordered the fried green beans, union rings, and catfish.  We also ordered some drinks.  The drinks were good, I had some Cherry Martini, but it was super sweet.  
Our apps came and they brought us fried zucchini which was ok.  I was disappointment that their breading doesn't have any flavor at all.  
I ordered the Chicken Rotisserie dinner.  15 minutes after we ordered our server let us know that mine would take a little longer because it is made fresh.  Totally ok, I don't mind waiting for food.  Then 30 minutes later the other food came and our server let me know that my meal was not coming, they decided to take it off the menu for the soft opening...ok well I ordered it 45 minutes ago, if you would have told me I could have ordered something else...but no biggie.  I ordered the burger because I figure it wouldn't take long.  My boyfriend and friend got fried chicken with a waffle.  Again the breading had no flavor, the chicken was moist and very yummy.  But I want to taste the breading.
My boyfriend and friend finished their food and ordered a dessert so I wouldn't be eating alone when my food came.  Another 25 minutes later our server tells us that she saw my burger on the screen...I wasn't sure what that meant.  15 minutes later she comes back and I asked if my burger has been started, she then tells us all the screens in the back went blank.  But she would check.  She comes back again and tells us that my burger has not been started, so I told her to not worry about it.  My boyfriend works in the restaurant industry, we figured since there was a mess up on their part they would have rushed my order, but nope.  Then we got our check.
She brought our check and explained this is what we would of paid but it was free due to being a soft opening. It was $104.  She never took off the Chicken, Burger, or dessert we never got.  The trio app was $20!  I would never have paid that for 4 union rings, 3 pieces of catfish and a few fried zucchini.  I won't be going back.  With Zinburger right next to it.  I would rather spend my money there.  It is a cool concept. 
I gave them 2 stars because the server was very friendly, it wasn't her fault the kitchen messed up."}
{"text":"Made a return visit to Lolos.The food is super. The bar is now open.The service was impeccable thanks to our waitress whose name is DEBBIE. Ask for her. We were there at lunch, Not sure how the service is at dinner time if they are crowded, but their food is worth a bit of inconvenience.No one does chicken like these guys do. Biscuits, best ever. ENJOY !!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating at LoLo's this weekend when I visited my family and I must say the atmosphere was great, the service was excellent and the food was on point.  Those of you who love chicken & waffles should venture out here and enjoy yourselves the way we did.  Looking forward to heading out there again in April."}
{"text":"What a hot mess?!  Slow service and food is just okay.  It is obvious that this restaurant has some training to do with their staff.  Don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews about this place, I just had a great experience there. We went in Saturday around noon and the wait wasn't awful, 15-20 minutes, which for downtown Gilbert is nothing. Our waiter was friendly and quick, our food came out quickly, and tasted great! I got 2 drumsticks and a waffle with a side of grits. The chicken was nice and juicy and the waffle was pretty good also. I enjoy thicker waffles with more substance but it was not bad  by any means. My sweet tea was excellent, being from Virginia I  looove a good sweet tea and it is hard to come by here. No complaints about the price either, I thought it was fair. My main dish was only 7 bucks and I think my boyfriend's was like 12. I was pleasantly surprised to find such quality southern food in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Mediocre soggy waffles that came to the table lukewarm and had to be sent back...nothing special about the chicken.  Spent the next hour throwing it up and letting it out bcuz it made us sick.  Try to season the chicken with more than lawry's to give it more flavor and add a touch of malt flour and perhps cinnamon to the waffle batter. Also, when serving 2 waffles, have it brought to the table quickly so that it stays crispy.  Overall, this restaurant was average at best"}
{"text":"I literally CANT STAND how amazing the food is here. There is NOTHING i can complain about besides the fact that i dont have an extra stomach to finish my meal. Lol #tapout"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I can't understand the novelty.  My order of 2 Lolo meals, which is 3 pieces of chicken, your choice of the pieces, and 2 waffles with mac & cheese.  First, our chicken tasted a lot like homemade fried chicken, nothing special as for as flavor.  The waffles were soggy and appeared to be under cooked, i.e. not golden brown.  We spent about $31 for two, but I didn't finish my meal.  Lastly, the mac & cheese did not have much of a soul food kick to it.  I've made better mac in my kitchen.    The positive thing about this place are the friendliness of the staff and the decor."}
{"text":"I recently dined at  Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffle in Phoenix and raved about the experience. I was looking forward to the same experience in Las Vegas. We visited the Las Vegas LoLo's on a Sunday and it was quite busy which usually is a good sign. The waitress announced that there were no \"Fresh Egg\" options - so Sunny Side Up or Eggs Over Easy were out of the question. I ordered a Chicken & Waffle Menu Item which included An Egg Scrambled with Onions & Cheese and a small side of Grits. The Chicken was good, hot and plentiful. Everything else was mediocre. The Waffles tasted powdery - my sister said it reminded her of Buckwheat. The Eggs were powdery as well. We were not impressed. In fact, I'm glad this was not my first Lo-Lo's experience. I'll be looking forward to Lo-Lo's again when I return to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give zero stars? My husband and I went on opening night and it was crazy busy, we were there for three hours! Don't bother talking to management because they're totally useless too. 

Tonight we tried to give them a second chance and yet again we were quickly sat by the hostess who had little to no customer service skills. No one offered drink or even greeted us for 20 minutes.. When I asked the hostess who was going to be serving us because every server was walking right past us, she pretended to go find a server as I continued to wait. When my husband and I proceeded to leave, they didn't seem to even care.

Any friends and family members that have visited have also had a similar experience. This is not a family friendly restaurant.  It doesn't seem like they've hired quality employees- this includes the managerial staff. 

If you decide to dine here make sure you have nothing else planned because you'll be there for a long time."}
{"text":"Service was slow and terrible.  Staff is confused.  I would not go back.  Bad for kids too."}
{"text":"Phenomenal place. Service was very helpful and food was great. I don't know why people are complaining about this place. My roommate and myself are coming back for sure."}
{"text":"While the building is bright and open, that's really the only upside of the experience. The food is ridiculously over priced for the quality and quantity you receive. Don't do it, you'd get a better deal at Church's and making your own waffles.

For $14, you will get stuffed french toast that has about 6 berries, no cream cheese, and three small pieces of bread. $4 for not even a cup of fried okra, really?!?!

Not at all impressed, and I had high hopes as I am a huge fan of Mrs. White's Golden Rule cafe, where it all started."}
{"text":"Terrible food and the service was subpar really bad. I waited two hour for this price that I could have made at home for a tenth of the price.  Come on a grilled cheese was toast and a piece of cheese.  General manager needs to really think about the lack of seasoning in the foid. When I can go to KFC and get better chicken (and I don't even like KFC) that really sad."}
{"text":"The chicken is tasty...I can do without the waffle. Mac and cheese had good flavor. We enjoyed the watermelon kool-aid. All in all ok...but I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"I went opening day, horribly cooked food. Went again last week still bad. I ordered chicken fried chicken, the bottom half was pure cartilage showing that the chicken they purchase is not good quality, or should I say not worth what they charge. The catfish was soaked from the juice of the Cole slaw that I asked to not place on my plate. I am a foodie and try my hardest to enjoy something from each experience. This was not a good one, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"After 20 minutes on my lunch break and not being waited on we got up and left.  The manager passed our table 4 times and did not even ask if we needed a drink or even to be helped. Wonder what the food tastes like?"}
{"text":"The service here is excellent! Our bartender was extremely attentive, personable, and informative. The location is also great. 

The food is average. The fried green beans were good, but the chicken and waffles weren't anything special. Great outdoor area. Would come back for drinks and aps."}
{"text":"This didn't sound like a typical breakfast combo,
But Wow! Fried chicken is so good by itself but add the what appeared to be the whole wheat waffles and eggs,is awesome. 
I would do brunch there often except I live in Kansas!"}
{"text":"I came in at 9:50 pm. I ordered the Toy Toy and banana pudding. It was absolutely horrible. The chicken was cooked hard and tasted like old grease. I consulted with the waitress, she replaced the wings with drumsticks. The drumsticks were pink and still tasted like old grease. The banana pudding was nasty too. It looked like instant mash potatoes. In all, I will never come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times.  I'll admit, it's a hit or miss with the wait time, but it's certainly worth the wait for the food.  For the past few times we've been, we've had the wonderful experience of dealing with Roman (I hope that's his name).  Great personality and really made us feel right at home.  Knows the menu like the back of his hand.  Overall great expereince every time we go.  

It's hard to find a great place for Soul Food in the East Valley.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that's looking for great soul food."}
{"text":"Don't eat here...yet. 

They don't have their act together. We came here on a weekday at noon, ant the wait was stated to be 30 minutes. A bit long for a weekday lunch, but oh, well, we were already here. What was super-frustrating is that after 37 minutes we got seated, and then the waitress told us the kitchen was \"behind\" 35-40 minutes and that we'd have to wait that much more to get our food. Interestingly, the tables were only half-filled, even though the hostesses were stating the wait was still 30-45 minutes at the time we were seated. That means the kitchen couldn't keep up with the restaurant half-full. Sad.

We've been to Lo Lo's original location in the divey house for many, many years, and the chicken pieces were always very large, but today one of my wings was tiny, simliar to what you'd expect from KFC. Otherwise, however the food was tasty.

I hope and expect they'll get their service issues worked out, but it would be worth waiting several months before giving them a try."}
{"text":"I been in here yesterday for lunch and got sat. I had to wait an hour for my food while all the other tables are getting their food. Is anybody gonna take my order. All the waiters including management was watching a stupid basketball game. How rude !! Their job is to be. taking care of guests. This is not the service I usually get. I like Lo Lo's..."}
{"text":"Was oook expected better. Prices are a little much for the quantity of green tomatoes and quality, no seasoning. You get 4 slices of fried tomatoes for $7.00. I also had biscuits and sausage gravy, which didn't have enough gravy. On top of that, they tell you how much to tip. Potatoes were hard in spots not quit done, eggs not cooked the way I ordered them. No, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times and really enjoyed the food ... but the tastiness is not worth the abnormally long wait times, slow service, or terrible customer service. I always tell people LoLo's is really good but make sure to try it on an off time and DONT order food to go. The last time I came here I ordered food to go at the beginning of the meal so it would be ready to go at the end -- I knew about the turn around time for a meal and tried to accommodate that with my request--It took an additional 30 mins for it to come out. The worst part was that management and serving staff kept coming by asking what I was waiting for so they could shoo me out of my table and seat someone else. Super annoying! And no one comped anything or offered to see what was taking so long."}
{"text":"SUCH A BAD EXPERIENCE. We waited over 30 minutes for our food. When it finally came out the bottom of our waffles were burnt to a crisp. My fried chicken was so dry and overdone that all the fried crust just fell off. 

After waiting so long for our food, it was finally delivered to our table. After the runner brought our food, we NEVER saw our server. No one checked on us or refilled our drinks or even looked at us. We spent 15 minutes trying to flag someone down. I finally got up and asked the hostess to send the manager to our table. After explaining the situation and showing her my burnt food, the manager said she would \"figure it out\" and walked away. She sent back our server who INSISTED on making me a meal to go. I told him over and over I didn't want a meal to go. He made me one anyways.

Obviously this location has major issues, as after our ordeal while waiting for our check we witnessed 3 other people getting comped meals for either waiting so long for their food or something wrong with their food. I think the manager wouldn't comp my meal because I am younger, but that's a theory. So much was wrong during our experience that comping my meal wouldn't have fixed it, but it would have maybe made a little difference in my opinion of the management.

Bottom line: NEVER EAT HERE. I've been to the Scottsdale location and the food and management are both better. Learn from my mistakes.

Also, this was on a not super busy Tuesday night. I can only imagine the horror that is this place on a weekend."}
{"text":"We have been to this location four times since they opened.  I guess we have a different view of our dining experience. The first time we ate here the food came out as fast as if not faster than the Scottsdale location.  The second time was a Friday night when the downtown was a zoo!  We received great service and the GM Maurice,  treated us fantastic.  I guess you get back the attitude that you give. 

The third time was more entertaining!  Our server, Carlos, was very polite,  but messed up our order. He was very apologetic and fixed our meals.  Other tables we watched him wait on also had messed up orders.  Carlos must have been having a terrible no good bad day! 

The fourth visit was great! Our server was Mike ( one of the twins from Scottsdale). He is great! He made our lunch very enjoyable,  plus our order was perfect. Thank you LoLo's for bringing him to Gilbert! 

I do agree that the staff needs a bit more training, especially the hostess girls at the front door."}
{"text":"Checked in at the front and was told it's a 2 hour wait... for lunch! 

And then what? Another hour wait just to order and get our food? That's ridiculous! The outside patio wasn't even filled. We were quite disappointed at the management of such a hyped restaurant. How was the food? I wouldn't be able to tell you: we left."}
{"text":"I came in on saturday and it was pretty busy and we had a party of 15 and they took us right in .  Most places make such a large party wait while they seat smaller parties but they grouped a bunch of tables together and just welcomed us right in with smiles.  Our server Angie was there within moments with a smile and got us our drinks with in moments and took our order right away.   Our food did take a second but that I'd to be expected since it was busy and we didn't make reservations and the place was packed .  And since they make fresh food unlike other places it takes time to prepare a decent meal.  In fact i think i would be more worried if my meal was ready within moments.... Like it had just been sitting there all day.  Anyways the whole staff was wonderful from the manager Jordan who had us laughing with his playful banter . To the wonderful host Whitney who not only greeted us but also helped bring our food and was right there to say a friendly good bye.  It almost felt like my family and i never even left home except we did none of the work of having to prepare such a delicious meal.  I dont know how you do it but keep up the great work guys"}
{"text":"Took almost a half hour to be seated(didn't even take our name). Once we were seated we noticed there were bugs everywhere due to the side of the shop being open to the outside. Overall would not go back.."}
{"text":"Pre-Grand Opening Jitters, Fried Chicken was really good. Will come back when things smooth out. FOH and BOH needed to iron out some issues."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings. I've been twice this month for chicken & waffles  - the waffles are soooo good. The chicken isn't bad, but it's not great, and it's not consistent. The first time the fried chicken was bland and a little over cooked. My second visit, it was cooked to perfection and had slightly more flavor. One of my guests had a soul food dinner and loved the mac & cheese, green beans and cornbread muffin.

One of my guests received his food, his biscuits and gravy were cold while the rest of the food was hot, and one of his items was missing and he waited nearly 15 minutes for it.

This morning my sister ate her leftover omelet which included fried chicken and she discovered two chicken bones, one she bit into while eating.

I really like the atmosphere, and I'm sure once they are well-staffed the service will get better, but I'm on the fence about visiting again."}
{"text":"Not as good as the one in Scottsdale... I think maybe the fryers are too new? I don't know. It wasn't terrible it just wasn't the same, but I guess that's what happens when you franchise"}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting more disappointing. Have a new building in downtown Gilbert and they must have high rent. The food is always good but the prices just keep inflating. We ordered a apple juice for our 4 year old when the ticket came it showed $1.50 kids drink and $1.00 juice cup? We questioned thinking they charged twice. The waitress states \"yah it's an extra dollar for milk or juice, sorry\". Never or no where does this price show up or get explained to us. Yes it's only a dollar but it's the principle, what else would a kid drink besides juice or milk?! Then after paying $3.50 for one glass of Pepsi I had about half a glass left and asked for a to go cup, waitress tells us, \"sorry we are all out of cups, the management took away to go cups because it was too costly to give a to go cup\". So I think, I could have 12 glasses here in the restaurant but when I ask for a to go cup that is 1/2 the size of the actual glass I can't get one?! Not only do we ask for a water then rather than the soda and she said they don't have that option either. I'm sorry but we live in AZ and it's 105 degrees at 1030a and you can't give me a cup of water but I can pay $42 for 3 waffles and 4 pieces of chicken and a kids juice and ONE glass of soda?!?!?  Totally over priced and won't be going back despite how good food may be, I mean they charge $3.50 for a glass of Kool-aid, you know it costs .18 cents a pack to make a gallon right?!? When food is good or may be worth the price it's different, but we just felt like we were totally taken advantage of. We then made a stop at Home Depot and long behold the have a large Hydration station for all shoppers as we walk in, guess they care if we don't over heat but Lolo's can't spare a refill or water cup?!?"}
{"text":"Such high hopes, so disappointed. Wife and I had chicken and waffles, kids breakfast.  Wife's tenders were bland, mine came out so overcooked the meat was like leather. I never complain (7 years in food service) but had to send them back. Second set of chicken, and the skin was separated from the meat cause the meat was so dry. I couldn't eat either. 

Kids loved the pancakes, and the sweet tea and kool-aid were great or else I'd give this a 1 star."}
{"text":"Service is HORRIBLE. My family and I went there on a Thursday night and waited over 3 hours for food. Never again will we go there. They even had the nerve to add gratuity to our check and we hardly seen our waiter.Warning...prepare to wait for your food and have bad service."}
{"text":"So came in on a Saturday evening a 30 min wait,it was pretty busy had to wait a while to receive our food it finally came found a hair in my food&my drumstick was red but everyone else's food was good Missty was our waitress she was great &was apologetic for the wait & food definitely will be back I'll wait until they cooks get better"}
{"text":"My husband &I went here with a large party (16!) tonight and we had a fantastic experience. The food still rocks and our servers were fabulous. Thanks Charrae and Tiana for being so attentive to our tables! I have to admit we were a bit worried about going there tonight with such a large group as prior reviews were discouraging. .. but our servers rocked. We still love Lolos!!!

Just fyi, arrive early and anticipate a wait.. but if you have a large group get your name on the list and stroll around downtown gilbert. It's a popular place and the food is great.. disregard the bad reviews .. our group had a fabulous experience."}
{"text":"I definitely won't be back to Lo-Lo's ....25 minutes to get a drink order plus having to ask twice for water...then when the order came...very dissapointed...I got the betty boob chicken was very over cooked,dry and just barely  warm, no seasoning, mac and cheese tasted like kraft no salt or seasoning. My daughter had the grits, lumpy and tasteless, shrimp, very very spicy, but cooked ok. The waffles  were pancakes made in a waffle iron with a little cinnamon soft and soggy. ..the only thing good was the biscuit.. NEVER TO RETURN....I would give it a half star."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is good. It's why we've been back several times. The awful service is why we had our last meal there tonight. 

We arrived just after 5:30 which shouldn't have been a problem...other than they close at 6pm. Management fail 1: your restaurant is in a trendy restaurant district...if you don't want to do a dinner service then you should close no later than 3pm. If you are going to do a dinner service then you should stay open until at least 8pm...especially if you are located in a high traffic area!

They seated us...and several other diners. This is where the problems started. The kitchen was already shutting down. They didn't tell us this. We didn't know they closed at 6pm at this point. We got clued in when there was a stream of potential diners yanking on the locked doors...management fail #2: you are leaving $$$ on the table. 

So the waiter takes our order and says our appetizer will be right out in a few minutes...which turned out to be 25 minutes later.  

5 minutes after the app arrives they come tell us that it will probably be another 20-30 minutes for our entree. At this point we ask to speak to the manager. 

The manager is unsympathetic and almost almost oblivious as to why we were upset. He didn't even apologize. We asked what he was going to do to make it right...which he didn't answer. Management fail #3: ignoring obvious problem with your service.  5 minutes later we see a couple get up angrily to leave while a 3rd table is up at the front counter angrily voicing their displeasure. 

So finally an hour after we arrived we finally got our food. It was good. Not the best we've had their but it was good. No real complaints. 

When our bill arrives...as expected they comp'd nothing. Not even a free cup of soda. They stunk out loud and not even a sorry from the manager. 

Management fail #4: they don't give a rip about their customers. This is clear from the overly restrictive menu policy (can't sub out a waffle for fries even when you ask nicely...or one of our party asked for a leg and thigh instead of two thighs). There's no reason they can't do this...they choose not to because they don't care. Their kids menu is severely small. No chicken finger option even though you can buy them the adult plate. No pancake option although you can buy them the adult plate version. They could do all this but they choose not to. Their menu is restrictive and limited in ways that are easily remedied without adding any additional overhead to their operation. 

We've eaten her 8-10 times and always wanted to come back. Not after tonight.  We are done until they get their priorities right and learn that customers pay the bills."}
{"text":"This is my reason for only 4 stars. Went to Lo Lo's Sat at 515pm. Did not receive my food until 615pm. Hostess came by to explain,  this is there first weekend and the kitchen is a bit behind. I really appreciated her honestly. Still thinking this food better be good. Ice tea was delicious. Next my food arrives. Mac and cheese. Three pieces of fried chicken. Collard greens, red beans and sweet potatoes. In a beautiful looking corn bread muffin with whipped butter.
Everything was delicious. Will return when the crowd dies down. Food gets 5stars. Wait time not so good"}
{"text":"The food was ok but it was very greasy. The waffles were thin and tasted like waffle cones. The chicken tenders tasted weird, but it wasn't bad. The service was terrible. We didn't get our appetizers until long after we got our food which took a really long time to arrive as well. They had forgotten about the appetizers and half of a friends meal. Our server wasn't very friendly either. Also, when our food came out, a few minutes later, our server came out and said \"okay what are we missing?\" I don't think that's the first thing I would ask a table who doesn't have most of their food. I ordered the chicken breast and waffle and the chicken was almost burnt with one really greasy spot somehow. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Mom heard about this place on the radio a few weeks ago. She came to visit this weekend so we thought we'd check out their website for menu items and pricing. As I scroll through, no prices, of course.....but there it was.... FRIED GREEN TOMATOES!!! Mom has been DYING for fried green tomatoes! We raced down there, excited and a little worried (who knows how popular they could be; line out the door?). We walked in and were seated right away. Lolo's is a large place (they took over the old Tony Romas) with plenty of seating. We were given a temporary menu as the place has only been open for 5 days and they don't have all the items they need for their complete menu, yet (the hostess told us). We peruse the menu, searching for the tomatoes....there they are.....wait.... $7???? OK well, how many come in the order? Server double checks and tells us there are 4 in an order. 4??? These must be some amazing tomatoes! So, we order them as well as the spicy corn fritters as appetizers. Spicy corn fritters were Amazing!!! I loved them. The tomatoes on the other hand were so so. Definitely not worth the price. Kind of disappointing since we chose this place because of the tomatoes! Mom ordered the biscuits and gravy with potatoes and eggs. No where near enough gravy to go with the biscuits, the potatoes were seasoned well but they were underdone and on the firm side. Mom asked for her eggs to be fried well done as she is not a fan of a runny yolk. One of the egg yolks wasn't completely cooked so she cut it away and put it on a separate plate so it wouldn't run into her gravy. I ordered the waffle and chicken breast (Betty Boob, I believe they called it). My meal was good, nothing spectacular. The warm syrup was pretty good. 

Overall, service was great. Our server was attentive and quick. Just wish for a better bang for my buck! Mom and i went Dutch. Corn fritters and Betty Boob (i drank water) cost me $16.22 with tax. At the bottom of my receipt, the recommended tip is $3.00 (18.5%). Paid the check and took our time leaving. 

Will I be back? Maybe. Could do those fritters again."}
{"text":"5 stars. Forget Roscoe's. Forget Hash House a GoGo, forget Waffle house, THIS is the chicken and waffle spot! Kool aid on tap! Kool aid cocktails! The waffles have cinnamon flavor that is awesome and the chicken was fried to perfection. The service was awesome. I was sad I found out about Lolo's on the 3rd day of the trip. Go here! Eat drink and buy the shirt."}
{"text":"It's not the same Lo-Lo's as the other locations...

Service isn't nearly as good, food isn't nearly as good, and the wait not only to find a table, but also for just the food is excessively long even when it isn't busy."}
{"text":"This is southern comfort food at its best. The kids like the Kool Aid but is too sugary for me. We typically go with the standard Chicken and Waffle combos which are staples. Have tried the fried green tomatoes which were interesting as I did not grow up on Southern food. I also liked the mojito which is made of Vodka instead of traditional rum. 

There is usually a wait for a table but it is worth it if you want some traditional southern comfort food. The wait staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"So I decided to give lo lo's a second try since the first time I came it was not what I expected. My salmon croquette was horrible it was soft and mushy. So this time I had chicken breast(that was good) grits(cold and full of butter) not to mention you have to open single packages of sugar to put it on your grits, now that's crazy. I also had eggs that I asked to be over medium and they were running as hell. The only thing I like about this place is the kool-aid and this time my kool-aid was warm I had to ask for a cup of ice to make it cold. I'm so disappointed I drive all the way from damn near Boulder city. They need a roscoes in Vegas FAST!"}
{"text":"Ate at Lo Lo's tonight and the food was good. So was the service however the wait was long and somewhat unorganized getting tables filled."}
{"text":"Just left your Gilbert location and my family and I had the greatest time! Our server, Shaun, was so welcoming and made sure we were enjoying ourselves and taken care of. He was always keeping busy but made us feel like his #1 priority. The chicken and waffles were delicious!! ( I ordered the DD's) There was a great atmosphere and our family just loves visiting downtown Gilbert. We will be back to see you again Shaun! Thx for the great service!"}
{"text":"I recently came to Vegas from the Bay Area and was craving soul food, I yelped this place and I was glad I did! The food here is great, the staff is very attentive and you always see a manager walking around seeing if customers are satisfied."}
{"text":"I came in here with my 2 sons this past Sunday. Second time here. Very busy but our server made an effort to check on us. When our food was brought out one of the servers who's name I will not forget, Shay, came charging over to our table, no smile, virtually rolling his eyes, and spilled piping hot syrup all over my 11 year old. After that, he turns away and said the \"f word\" so loudly that I caught two other tables glancing over with their eyebrows raised. Did he apologize to me or my son? Not once. Our actual server did the most apologizing of anyone and seemed to be the only person with any general concern. The manager did very quickly come over and talk with us, but the server who did it, never even looked at us. Terrible server. You can't even tell an 11 year old you're sorry for burning him, due to delivering food being below you. Go on a Monday. Food is worth another try."}

{"text":"Little pricey for breakfast. 
Usually if it's over 12 has a reason like organic or farm fresh and lolo's didn't so I'm not really used why breakfast was 13-15 a plate unless you got chicken and waffles. 
So I got biscuits and gravy and it was ok. 
Nothing I will ever crave or seek out. 
My husband got chicken and waffles. 
It was ok. 
Chicken was foot. Waffle was ok. Not really exciting. 
They had a great happy hour of tequila sunrise for $4. Not sure if weekend special or since it was Halloween.  
Service was great. 

Not that the food was bad, the food was ok. But just ok... For as much per plate- it was not excellent or organic or farm fresh. It was just expensive ok food."}
{"text":"We were extremely excited to try this place and had heard great things from a friend. We took my husbands parents and were extremely disappointed. We arrived around 1200pm on a Sunday and the wait time was about 20 mins which was not bad. After getting our seats it took a server over 20 mins to take our drink order or to even acknowledge us. Afterwards we were ignored.  The time that it took to take our order was ridiculous.  Then after almost 2 hours of waiting on our food to arrive  I finally asked to speak to a manager, Nate, and within minutes our food arrived. He apologized and said he would offer us a discount.  The food itself was was wonderful. If we had not been so excited to catch up with my husbands parents we would have left. I dont know if it was a racial thing as we are a white family but every other black family was served and taken care of before us. The discount that Nate promised never happened instead he comp a drink. Needless to say, food was great, service was horrible."}
{"text":"I love Lolo's, like someone suggested on another review: Go at a awkward time so that you can beat the crowds....I usually sit at the bar to bypass the waits, but my most recent time everything was open. I love the mimosa's and our hostess was so sweet and helpful. We always get the 3 pieces of chicken and catfish with sides. I love their greens and the potatoes and greens. I love the new location and it is now closer to me since I am in Mesa. I will definetly be back :)"}
{"text":"Love Lo Lo's but my first experience today at the Gilbert location was terrible.  Waited almost an hour only to learn we'd been paged 20 min earlier - the girl fat fingered our number hitting a 1 instead of 4.  No apology - just a shrug.  Finally get seated and learn that they just ran out of 4 different items we tried to order.  20 minutes earlier and I would have had what I wanted.  As a nice coda to my terrible customer experience I noticed the same red Porsche with \"Be your own boss\" on the back was in the closest 15 minute pick up spot for my whole two hour ordeal.  Think it's the owner / managers.  Tells you where customers rate with this operator - obviously the service issues related to tone from the top."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh myyyyyy goodnesssssss!  I was so excited when I saw the menu I could hardly decide what to get.  It's been ages since I allowed myself to eat soul food and I had saved my appetite.  Lo Lo's did not disappoint. If you like greens, you MUST have the collards. The cornbread??? Reminds me of Jiffy.  I had the catfish and couldn't resist getting a croquette on the side.  I heard the fried chicken is crunchy and seasoned well.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Only thing is... that ITTIS hit me quick.  I had to stop for coffee just to get home!  But I'm going back for the pineapple upside down pancakes. Makes my mouth water just thinking about them.  The bar, food and service was great.  I'm holding a point for cleanliness because the bathroom needed attention and I had to send my silverware back for a fresh set.  I want to give it 5 stars so bad."}
{"text":"Not excited about this place.  My bf wanted to check it out and him being a chef said the seasoning on the chicken was too much,  and the rice and beans looked like it was sitting under the hot lamp for quite some time.  I had to ask to replace it.   The catfish was okay... I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.  Out of all southern cooking in Vegas I recommend P Dub BBQ."}
{"text":"Our visit was around 12.30p on Saturday. Not as busy, seated right away. We chose inside table. Service was okay, nothing special. Ambiance was a little loud for our liking, we had to raise our voice to hear each other. But no biggie. We looked at the menu and was surprised at the prices, for example, $13 for 3 pieces of chicken and waffle, Lo-lo's. We're not familiar with \"southern\" food, so we had expectation that it had to be better than other  chicken/wing joints that we frequent. Skin was crispy, but tasteless. The meat was just plain, just like chicken I could fry at home. And it's greasy. Waffle was soggy, like pancake. Maybe we expected crispy waffle. Disappointed, we ordered banana pudding. It looked wonderful. Again the taste was like boxed pudding from grocery. So, I'm giving 3 for food, 3 for service, I knocked 1 star because it's overpriced."}
{"text":"Visiting from Houston. Locals suggested I  check this joint out. I was not disappointed. So impressed... I went back for a second time. The waitress ( Andrea) was AWESOME! The fried chicken, shrimp and grits, banana Carmel pancakes (with FRESH bananas), bloody Mary and service will keep me coming back each visit to Arizona!"}
{"text":"Went to Lolo's for the first time the other day and was amazed! At first I was hesitant, because it was a little busy, though I was seated right away! My boyfriend lives & works in Gilbert but was late meeting me due to a meeting so I was waiting for about 15 minutes. My server continued to check on me even though my entire party was not there yet, and even chatted with me about some of her favorite items on the menu since I mentioned I had not been there before. When he showed up & we did eat, the food was out within 10 minutes of us ordering. Hot, and amazing! I am actually going back next week for a social with some friends that have been wanting to try it but a little bit hesitant. Great staff, great service, beautiful location! Even if you're not from gilbert, I would take the drive!"}
{"text":"[Have to pre-pay??].  Placed a \"to-go\" order by phone, for some catfish fillets.  At the end of my order, the person who answered the phone told me that I would have to give my credit card information over the phone in order to have my order made. When she asked if that was \"okay\"? I couldn't hold back my chuckle and said \"really?\" - \"I can't pay when I pick up my food?\". She then said \"that's fine\" and we ended the conversation.

The food was okay - not great, but okay. Not sure if I will be back.  It was a little overpriced at $4 per fillet of fish.  If you're looking for better southern fried catfish, try Texas Roadhouse.  Great service, and you don't have to pre-pay for your food"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you expect good service. The host was rude and didn't seem like he wanted to deal with anybody. I waited for 5 minutes before he even took my name down. He has an attitude. Waitress wasn't even better. Asked for a water 3 times had to ask a different waitress for a drink in order to even get it. Food was good. Hopefully their staff gets a wake up call on giving guests good service."}
{"text":"So yummy!! Lemonade and blue kool-aide were pretty sweet, but nothing a little water couldn't fix! Service was awesome, vibes were great. Waffle was my favorite part!"}
{"text":"I had my eye on this place since before it opened, but I wanted to wait until I had visitors in town so it would be a special occasion. I'm pleased to say, it was worth the wait.

My dining companions ordered the 3 ap platter with Spicy Corn Fritters, catfish biegnets, and fried green tomatoes. The corn fritters were killer - I will definitely order them if I go again. They were a little spicier than I expected, but it was a nice surprise. The fried green tomatoes were good, but I had never had that dish before and I know it is something people have a lot of opinions about. I didn't have the catfish, but it looked crispy and my friends said they liked it.

We ordered booze as well, and I felt the mixed drinks were a pretty reasonable value. I got the Georgia On My Mind, which was excellent, and I tried my friend's Orange Creamsicle, which was also excellent. The gentlemen in our party got beer, which was stated as the house special but rang up as Busch Light on our bill: not sure if our waiter was giving us the hook-up on price, or if they are actually passing off Busch Light as a house special.

I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken platter with Mac n Cheese, buttered corn and cornbread. The mac n cheese was great, best I've ever had in a chain restaurant. It's baked, so it tastes homemade instead of the weirdly liquid cheese you get at some other places. The buttered corn definitely came from the bottom of the pot, but it tasted fine in spite of looking kinda weird. The chicken fried chicken was crispy outside and juicy inside. The dish comes \"smothered in sausage gravy,\" but I asked for the gravy on the side because I thought it might make the chicken soggy. The gravy was delicious and chunky when I dipped my chicken in it, so I can't wait to go back and get the Biscuits and Gravy. 

My friends split the KKs special (which was a good idea because the ap platter was huge!) They were very pleased with the fried chicken, waffle and scrambled eggs, but the grits had huge mountains of butter on them, and they didn't particularly care for the grits under the butter.

I definitely plan to go back. There are at least 5 other things on the menu I'm dying to try!"}
{"text":"Was worth the drive from Henderson. Just what I expected. Good southern food. Just remember, if you have to stand in line at a restaurant it's either good or free. This place is good. Will not walk away hongry."}
{"text":"I would give one...but out waitress was great so she earned a star for herself. The food here is horrible. Nothing compared to the other locations. We ordered and less than 5 minutes later our food came out...and it was horrible. You could tell it had just been nuked in the microwave. We told the waitress and she brought us another plate. Still totally microwaved but we ate since we were limited on time. If you're gonna go...take the drive to Scottsdale or Phoenix. It's worth it. The Gilbert one does not compare."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. Food took forever, waiter brought it out one at a time causing people in the group to wait. Shrimp and grits is a total no go. Shrimp was hot, grits cold. I wish I could give this a half star..."}
{"text":"One word .... Disappointment. I have been to the Phoenix location and this was horrible compared to there. The place is way to small inside, service staff had no clue what they were doing, and they need to clean there fryers and cook the chicken correct. We had 3 different orders that were not ours come to our tableaux the staff never checked to see how our food was . The chicken tasted like dirty fryer that was not hot enough and the chicken was in there way to long and dry. Very big disappointment I will stick to the Phoenix location don't go here!"}
{"text":"Look you go to an icon restaurant on day 4 of being open you expect delays. LoLo's has the cure an app that lets you know where you are in line and a text to let's  you know when your table is ready. Went and did some shopping and came back seated right away. The chicken, grits, waffles and Mac& cheese amazing. 5 stars and I will come back again and again. I did not have the shrimp and grits but shut the front door it looked amazing."}
{"text":"First off, service was great compared to all the other reviews about this restaurant. The quality of food though is a different story. I got the DD which is one of the waffles with two breasts of fried chicken. The waffle itself was very good with a great hint of cinnamon. The chicken itself wasn't so great. The chicken came out rather dry and hard, almost like the  fried chicken you'd get at a grocery store deli. For the price of 12 dollars that it costs, I recommend you use your money a restaurant you can get a lot more for 12 dollars. For better fried chicken and waffles I'd look towards M&M Soul Food."}
{"text":"Food is great, I had the soulfood platter.  Southern fried.  Highly recommend.  The restaurant is very well suited,  open space TV'S mounted around the room.  Little on the loud side.  I can see the potential to be awesome.  The staff is in need of training, slow... we didn't mind the 5 to 10 minutes wait that turn into 25 minutes.  Especially when we counted 8 open tables.  Service is slow and staff seems unorganized.  Yes I will try it again."}
{"text":"Went too Lo-Lo's our first day here in Vegas with our grandchildren, who Loves there good. I must say the atmosphere was perfect, the customer service was awesome , the food was spectacular. All I can say is that for the price you pay it is totally worth it at this chicken and waffles restaurant. Every person who worked there had smiles on there faces. I would dine there again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Chicken is just ok...being from the South, I know fried chicken!  The fried green tomatoes are a joke.  They use thick and pasty cornmeal breading.  They come to the table looking great, but there's a little tiny slice of funny looking green tomato that is very small inside a huge amount of breading.  The red beans, are like chili beans with lots of chili powder and cumin, not at all like true red beans.  I do give credit to the cornbread, it was pretty good.  Overall, food is below average and the price is outrageous!  Service was above average, but food couldn't make up for the decent service. Wayyyyy too pricey for what you get!"}
{"text":"So, we have been here several times now.  Went when they first opened and had some wings  The wings were really good.  I loved the house made wing sauce they use.  So good.  The second time we went, I had the Betty Boob which is a single breast and a waffle.  The waffle was great but the breast was so dry.  We ordered the wing sauce on the side to dip the chicken breast in but they got the order mixed up and brought us a plate of the wings.  The bartender ended up giving us the wings and charged us .95 for the side of sauce.  The last time we went, the food was basically a fail all the way around except for the catfish...oh the catfish.  If I had just had a plate of that and nothing else, this would be a 5 star review.  It is delish.  Overall, the service is fine but the food is a miss more than it is a hit.  Will be back for catfish though."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had and waitress was Horrible. ... chicken taste like crap KFC is better. Biscuits and gravy sucked I make it.better... swett tea was awesome that's about it..."}
{"text":"First time hear,  and we've been looking forward to visit Lo  Lo's.  The food was good our waitress Tanisha was very friendly and informative. Like I said it was  
our first time here.  While they were busy it just seemed like the wait was a little long then expected. There was a waiter  by the name of Roy who came over and asked us if any one had greeted us and we told him yes, and I think that was very professional and that put us at ease knowing the other staff acknowledged us when he wasn't our waiter.  Thank you for the experience."}
{"text":"I live in Phoenix so have been to the Lolos chicken and waffles in that area as it's the original start of Lolos. So when I saw Lolos up here in Las Vegas I thought I would stop by and eat lunch. I was quite excited when I saw they had beer on tap and a bar! So I sat at the bar and ordered lunch. It was the middle of the afternoon and they were only maybe 10 people in the whole place. I've never had such bad service at a Lolos.  I had asked twice for my big jar of drink to be refilled. The bartender was almost nonexistent the whole time I was there. I love Lolos food, but I'm not sure I'll go back to this location."}
{"text":"Before my recent visit to the location in Gilbert, my family and I would always go to lolo's (Phoenix location) and we would spend a good amount of money here. This is the spot where I would bring my family to eat that would come from California to visit and I would always recommend to coworkers etc. One visit we had wrote the owner on Facebook just to let them know that the quality of the food wasn't at its best and there were no greens. Mind you we weren't expecting anything in return we just wanted to let them know. But the DM Dewayne offered to send us something in the mail and it was a ten dollar gift card. On 4th of July I decided to take my kids to dinner at the Gilbert location. I ended up getting my bill and using the gift card but the waitress returns to me and says there is no money on there. So she speaks with the manager who then comes and talks to me about the NOT ACTIVATED gift card. She then asks me well why was I sent this gift card and where did I get the gift card like as if I was pulling some fraud stuff. At the end of it all I ended up having to pay for my whole bill she didn't even bother to take 10 dollars off. Not to mention another visit I had brought my cousin to eat here and he ended up having foil in his greens and she was not sincere about the situation all she did was offer another side of greens. I did not feel I was treated as a customer and now I'm questioning whether or not I even want to continue spending my money on this place or just not going to the Gilbert location ANYMORE. If you have a problem here, don't even bother bringing it to their attention because the manager will not care! I'm still trying to get a hold of the DM who sent me an UNACTIVATED gift card. If your going to eat at Lolo's, I do not recommend the Gilbert location AT ALL. I live in Mesa but I will take the drive to the Phoenix or Scottsdale location to avoid coming here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! My husband, son and I went on a Sunday afternoon and it was the perfect family atmosphere. Started with Fried Green Tomatoes. Best I've ever had. We ordered the Puff's Chicken Tenders with a waffle. Also tried the Fried Okra. I haven't had it outside of the South and it was perfect. Our server Chris was super friendly and very attentive. So incredible! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a team outing and had a great time! Our waitress Nikki was attentive and made sure not to forget about us. I had the #8 Betty's Boob! One chicken breast and a waffle. It was cooked to perfection! I will be back with the family soon!"}
{"text":"I loved the old scottsdale location, and i LOVE the new one too.

Visually, this location is amazing and i do love that it has a full bar. Here are my two complaints:

1) it's obvious that this one is new, because it seems like all of the staff just isn't quite there yet. They waitstaff was lacking a little. I feel like it took too long to order/get water/we weren't checked up on very often/it took them too long to tell us our table was ready (they definitely forgot about us until we went up and said something). 

2) it's obviously a family restaurant, but they wear shirts with sexually suggestive slogans on them. I'm a 26 year old guy, i'm no prude, but i can't say i'm a fan of wearing shirts talking about big tender juicy breasts when serving some little kids who came in with their parents for a fun family meal. 

I have faith that this place will be a lot better in the coming months, and if I lived here, I assure you i'd be back very soon."}
{"text":"This was my very first time here in this restaurant. The waiters was really good and nice. So I ordered the kk's number 1, and when I got my order the chicken wing was not cooked all the way,  it was salty and chicken was greasy. I did not enjoy the meal at all. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Back to being my favorite... thank God the original proprietor took it over... just as good as Phx.... thank you... it's our once a week spot again...."}
{"text":"Chicken, fried okra and corn muffins all to die for.  Macaroni and cheese was meh--kind of sticky and overcooked.  Waitresses offer great service.  Overall totally delicious and very hard to choose--everything on the menu looks delicious.  I wish the menu were a little more affordable.  The prices are a bit on the high side. Also, not a lot of seating for larger families."}
{"text":"I was so sad to find the food had no flavor. My favorite thing was the fried okra. Then not only was the food bad but the bathrooms were disgusting. It really showed how little they care about their customers."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is just off the charts. Juicy and tender inside and crispy tasty outside. It's like a comfort food for me. My bf enjoyed his breakfast treat too.. I have beeen wanting to go back and grab those fried chicken again. Really gooood"}
{"text":"Horrible service including the manager. They missed over half our order, and the stuff they brought was still wrong.  We left hungry and with a $40 charge.  The manager was too busy worried about what he can charge us than bringing our food or satisfying us as customers.  Rather drive 20 miles to get to the other location than ever come to this one again. Save yourself the hassle from this place and drive to the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Wow, I am really sorry to say but I believe that Lo Los, has hit rock bottom, or Lo Low....  I went to the original restaurant downtown and got the Famous Red Velvet cake to go, and when I made it back to the house to eat it to my surprise no walnuts and it was like half a slice.  I remember back in the day they would have to force the container to close not the case anymore, I guess since it was to go can't really complain right!!  Benefit of the doubt, went to the Gilbert location, did the same thing and I had called in advance to see what the deal was about the walnuts, and I was told that you have to ask for them specifically ( looking out for the people with nut allergies) ok.  So I ask for a slice to go with walnuts and some Banana Pudding, here we go, get back to the house and open up the Famous Red Velvet, too my surprise No Walnuts again, and hardly any frosting, (I could actually see the red cake through the frosting, top and sides), took a bite and It was so dry (disgusting) straight to the trash, thank goodness I had the banana pudding can't mess that up right, well I would not have guessed that they would fill the container with more frosting than pudding (so bad), I really wanted to call up there and go off, but they will not get a minute more of my time.  I have always heard there service was questionable and the food would make up for it, but now the food has taken a turn for the worse, so there is no real reason to go there.  Seems to me like they are only out for the money now, sorry, save your money, they are running neck and neck with KFC."}
{"text":"Happy Mother's Day ain't nothing like Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles don't forget the mimosas see you on my next trip out about three or four times before I go back home love it."}
{"text":"Ordered the egg white omelet with no cheese. Found a long curly hair in my omelet. Nuff said!"}
{"text":"I live out in Phoenix(where it originated) and it doesn't come close to the one in Phoenix. Service was slow and it wasn't packed, I got the shrimp Mac and cheese and it looked like it was sitting out for days and was dried up"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this location is great. I love the decor and layout. My husband and I got waffles and chicken strips, and the taste was great. The reason I give it 3 stars is that the service is extremely slow. It took forever for our food to come out and once we were finished, we waited several more minutes for our check to come. I don't often get impatient but when it's wasted time, it can be frustrating."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO or a negative star I would.  Me and a group of friends Went here for breakfast because it was closer. Hmmmm...horrible food and waitress!! Waitress talk like she was competing in who can \"talk faster\" competition with the staff. 
The chicken didn't have any taste to it, it was bland. I had to add salt and pepper to the chicken. Which later I just picked over it couldn't stomach eating it.
My eggs I order scrambled soft. I received them and they looked hard. I tasted them and they were the texture of McDonald's processed GROSS eggs. Told our waitress, she took them, came back 1 minute later...which I thought was pretty fast for some FRESH scrambled eggs...they were the same eggs but with water added to them. I was told the eggs are always scrambled to order... I said these are nasty and the taste like they were powered buffet style eggs. A friend order eggs as well and said he's tasted the same. We won't be returning to this restaurant the food is straight garbage. I'll go to IHOP first at least I'll get Fresh eggs."}
{"text":"Food was delish and the service was fantastic. Our waitress was very personable, sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"My second time here and it's just as good as the 1st.  I'll tell you what I appreciate the most about LoLo's chicken (drum roll please) it's simple, they have bone in chicken.  I know it's not a big deal but it's a personal preference probably because I was 1st introduced to \"Chicken and Waffles\" at Roscoe' s in LA, so when I get a filleted chicken  breast that's been battered and fried, I tend to pout.  I also like that there are various combinations wof the same meal on the menu, no need to ask if they can add a this or substitute a that, it saves time when ordering which is a very important thing when you're hungry.  I was so hungry I forgot to check in that's why in my check in photo the waffle is half way gone, don't judge me. Oh, and I gave it five stars because the service was great the lady who sat me was a dear, Nathan my server stoped by twice to check up on me and so did some other guy plus the bathroom  was clean. Very pleased....... and full, oof"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waited with a young child for a seat. Several people that came after us was seated before us. We had a young child crying for food they refused to get a manager or seat us at one of the open seats. If you want good service and attentive staff go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Waitress was friendly but the meal wasn't!!! Took way too long for someone to take our order....
Dry Overcooked Chicken... 
Tasteless Soggy Waffles....
We even had some uninvited guests join us during the meal ( little flying gnats ) !   Not a good look! 
I was truly excited to try LoLos due to the people who rave about it being better then Roscoes. ..LIES!!!! I went in with a open mind and mouth! Neither were pleased.  On the flip side the restaurant is nice looking with a pretty bar and outside patio! Music is very loud tho, hard to hear when talking.  If they pay attention to the food more then this place could be worth the visit! Maybe we just came on the wrong Sunday."}
{"text":"First timers to Lo-Lo's. Food was alright. Chicken was a bit over cooked & dry. Waffles was a little bland. Server Demetria was awesome! The ambiance of the restaurant is superb! Willing to come back & try other dishes on the menu! 

Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in CA will still be our all time favorite. Hands down!"}
{"text":"As others have stated the chicken is dry.  I suspect it is cooked ahead and held under a heat lamp. Not cooked to order the way any good fried chicken should be served. 

The service was good. Though I ordered a pint of beer and got the tall ($2.00 extra). $7 bucks for a draft beer during happy hour?  The meal was $50 including an 18% tip. One mixed drink, one draft beer and two entrees. 

I won't be rushing back here anytime soon.  I was slightly underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I love Lo Lo's and have been anticipating the new location in Gilbert. I've been talking it up for quite a while. The Central Avenue location has some of the best chicken I've ever had...crispy and juicy and wonderful.

It takes a while for a restaurant to get things just right and, unfortunately, the Gilbert location isn't quite there. The chicken was pretty dry and the waffles were over cooked. My family members were less than impressed with their meals. I wasn't surprised to see similar comments here on Yelp. 

It wasn't a terrible meal just not the quality I anticipated, but I know their potential and I'm confident they'll get it figured out.  I'll be back in a month.

The servers were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"From Cali to visit our grandma (93 yrs young!) Had the most AMAZING lunch!!! LOVE this place! Our waiter, EJ was the best!!!"}
{"text":"Usually we love LoLo's.  We checked Yelp tonight to see what time  they closed.  It says 8pm. 
We drove for a 1/2 hour to get there by 6:20,  then was told by the manager that they closed at 6!!!  NOT COOL!!!  Why does YELP say that they close at 8?"}
{"text":"Strange combo but it is amazing! The chicken is fried to perfection and the waffles have a cinnamon hint to them I think which makes them melt in your mouth! Great for big groups as well! Probably my favorite downtown Gilbert eatery."}
{"text":"Our food was good. The food is hardly the reason for this review-service was terrible. We were told when we were being seated that they were \"low on silverware\" and someone would bring some out to our table when they got some \"washed up\"...ok? Our server would go missing for 15 minutes at a time-disappearing to the back. The whole staff seemed as if they were at a party, which is great in theory. However, when the 'party' gets in the way of work actually being done or something beiing accomplished-that's where they loose me. At least advertise that your staff is here to play and not work. To add insult to injury we never got any silverware and subsequently went without any napkins. Just what I wanted during a night on the town-greasy chicken with no luck getting a napkin since we didn't see the server again until we were done with the meal. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and super customer service. Wasn't really packed for a Saturday night which was a little odd being all the other restaurants had lines? Grits came out hot! Food came out warm. This is a must try if you like waffles"}
{"text":"Well I came with high expectations I waited over an hour for my food.  I got the biscuit and gravy, wing, potatoes and eggs.  My eggs came out cold I sent it back they warmed it up I asked for it to be taken off my bill. The biscuits and gravy was warm I still ate it the potatoes were hot and so was the chicken. The food didn't settle well and I had to get it out and it was the most gruesome purge. It made me sick and now I'm in the bathroom.  There wasn't that many people in the restaurant for service to be so terrible. I was highly disappointed I don't recommend anyone trying that place. I spoke with friends that went before me and they said the lemon water was the best thing on the menu.  Save your money guys they have work to do on food and service.  Just terrible!!!"}
{"text":"Love it! Some amazingly good food. Staff was very nice. It's the perfect place for brunch. I am definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Jenae & Nikki - phenomenal servers!! The food was exceptionally great!! And the General Manager Dewayne showed great leadership to his staff, helped where he was needed and always on the move while checking on guests!! Love this place! We will be back with many more friends!!"}
{"text":"Lolo'a has great food. Chicken & waffles is really good. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. I don't eat fried foods on a regular basis, but I will return to Lolo's when the urge hits me for some more chicken & waffles. The iced tea is good also."}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffles? Well it's their third or more location so we were game to try it out. The Place: 
 As you approach the restaurant  your head is filled with a sickenly sweet aroma that fills the palate and reminds me of being on a pier with cotton candy and a ferris wheel. The restaurant is deafeningly loud  on a busy Saturday night.
The food:
The chicken was moist and crisp on the outside and just beautifully prepared. There was no seasoning at all which would have really showcased this dish. Salt is a flavor enhancer, try some. it was bland and boring. ho hum
The waffle was oversweet and I wouldn't even like it for dessert. I prefer to put my sweet (syrup or fruit) on top of the waffle, not have the waffle over sweet to begin with. 
We tried it; won't go back though. 

Except maybe for a piece of chicken, I\"lll bring my own salt and peppa"}
{"text":"Not sure the hype of this place. Went for opening week and the service was terrible. The owner/manager??? was not friendly at all. Witnessed him rudely telling customers to move out of the way using his hands in a shooing manner. Maybe it was a stressful week? Not impressed. 

Went back 2 more times and not really sure when I will have the urge to go back. Food was decent but really pricey for a fried chicken and a waffle. I think I can Pinterest something more worthy of my $$."}
{"text":"All these empty seats but an hour and a half wait?? Saw hostesses getting cut, waiters standing around, talking. I had to ask what was going on with the empty six top in order for our group to be sat. Crazy. Not sure what's going on but whatever it is they don't know how to fill up a restaurant and keep it running smooth on a busy day. Hope the food is better than the service."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes at the door no one said anything to us when I asked the hostess about getting seated she gave me attitude said she's busy cleaning tables when there  was a dozen tables open.  Why would I pay to eat there with employees like that?"}
{"text":"I saw this place while headed to the McDonald's next door. I quickly decided to try this place instead and I'm glad I did. I love the crispy well seasoned fried chicken while my husband loves the stupid fries. The scenery is laid back and the music just right. I might try it again."}
{"text":"Wanna know what fucking sucks? The customer service here. Hands down the worst service I ever had in my life. The food was decent but you couldn't pay me to go here again."}
{"text":"So we went here, we get out of the car and several people say don't go in there, there's a rat (note: these people's outburst is not the fault of the restaurant but the clientele) we decide to go in anyways. We enter in and are clearly seen but not greeted by what I can only assume was staff. One gentleman said dryly that the wait was 45minutes. The lady behind the counter said to him that it was 30 minutes. He replied with \"I'm just trying to prepare them.\" For what I don't know. To note maybe 5 tables in total were occupied the rest left open cleaned and neatly put together. I have no idea what would cause the delay but I thought it was a bit off. We kindly left. They receive one star for the poor customer service and lack of even a decent greeting."}
{"text":"I want to complain but the food is so good I just can't lol! No, seriously my first visit was all of 5 stars! It was back in July and right before my flight. I came in was greeted and sat in a timely matter, drinks, etc and let me add.....those gizzards and grits LORD JUST AMAZING! Well this time I had to knock off 2 stars but you guys did make one back up. I had friends from out of town in and we decided to take a trip to the famous gizzard place I had been raving on. 8 of us come in and was greeted by this pleasant young lady. Was told it would be a min while another young lady set the tables up, no problem it was quick. However just that quick she told us the table was there and that was it. Lol. No walking no showing no pointing. It went down hill from there. We sat there for a good 15 mins before a young lady asked us who was our waitress and if we was taken care of. Another 5 minutes for her to come back take drink orders and told well we're really busy so can you place your orders now. I felt like she was telling us put it in now since you all have been sitting for 25 mins or wait another hour. Anyways I waited so long for drinks that I couldn't take it any longer and asked for the manager. He was cool about the situation and did what he could I'm guessing. They asked us a million times afterwards was we ok but we still waited a while for our food to come out and it wasn't all together. Nevertheless, the lady who ditched us at the front apologized and we got free dessert and drinks! I will be back but maybe with a smaller crew so it won't be discouraging to the workers. Food is delicious however! Those greens and cornbread OMG! THE KOOLAID...OMG! THE FISH....OMG! Big/huge portions also! Oh the music is off the chain! Love it!"}
{"text":"The food is always good here, however when they are busy it is  completely unorganized and chaotic.  This is the second time this happened here. (The first time I gave them a pass) waiting to be seated they 'accidentally ' seated 3  groups of people prior to us. Then once we were seated we did not get a server for over 15 minutes at which point I stood up and went to the counter to get water.  The waitress then proceeded to bring me water but no one else at the table. 8-10 minutes later we finally get a waitress attention to bring the rest of the table water and a menus.   NEVER GOT THAT.  10 minutes later and I request a manager. Been at the location for 30 minutes at this point. Manner gets there and things move on quickly and efficiently go l from there.  Then we done eating we sit (I am timing at this point) 11 minutes before I flag a waitress down and ask for to go boxes for the food we want to take. She brings back ONE (1) to go box for me.  At this point the whole table is getting agitated. But remain calm.  So 4 trips later and the proper amount of to go boxes and bags we are ready for the bill. We sit for 11 minutes and then I finally I start trying flag a hostess down. Finally a waitress comes to the table directly next to ours. After she completed with that table I said excuse me (my voice is deep and was was loud enough for other people to turn around.) She stopped but DID NOT turn around.  Then my mother said excuse me again...the watreess stopped looked directly at us. Looked back at the papers in her hand and proceeded to walk away. Then the table behind said wow! So once again I went to get the manager. When he gets to me the first thing he said was \"Wow! Your still here!?\" He apologized profusely, comped the meal. We left an my mother said she would never come back here again and we have been coming here since they first opened. Attrocious service except for the manager. This was the worst service I have EVER had anywhere. The food and the Manager were the ONLY saving grace."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!!!!
Ordered an egg white omelette, 
Took 10 minutes hust to bring drink,
Waitress NEVER came back to ask how food was,
Entire bottom of the omelette was so overcooked was hard to chew. 
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was hit, fresh, and seasoned well. I ordered the Puff's strip basket with a waffle, and it was delish. The waffle was yummy and had a hint of cinnamon. The Arnold Palmer with sweet tea was especially refreshing. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is to die for! Perfectly crispy and seasoned with just a tiny hint of spice. The waffles are good too, but the chicken is surely the star. Fairly priced- you get a lot for what you spend. Wait times can be long during busy times, well worth it. Plus, they have kool-aid and the sweeeeetest iced tea if you're craving a southern glass. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Tried to check this place out a few weeks ago on a Sunday night around 6:00pm, but had to back out due to the line being out the door with a minimum hour wait. Post church rush possibly? Became a little skeptical when I started reading bad reviews about it, especially one from a coworker who USED to be a big fan of this place. Hmph.

Took a gamble this Saturday at 8:00pm... no line, no wait, requested a booth & was seated immediately. Bar was completely empty and they were surprisingly slow -- yet it took quite a while for them to take our order, I'm not sure if it's because they have an extensive menu but I had to flag someone down 15 minutes into sitting just so we could just order our drinks.

Their menu, as stated, was surprisingly extensive. They have an all-day breakfast section with omelettes, pancakes, french toast, eggs and more. They have a \"lo-lo's hood classics\" & \"the eats\" section that features a plethora of soul food-esque combination plates, with a long section of additional sides & add-ons. But we came here for the famous chicken & waffles, so that's what we opted for. 

FOR HER: 
- The \"TRE-TRE'S\" which came with two drumsticks & one waffle. The chicken batter was decent, so were the waffles -- which seemed to have a cinnamon kick. I also ordered a side of the BISCUITS & GRAVY ($4 for one, 6$ for two). They were much larger than I imagined and the sausage gravy was pretty tasty!
FOR HIM: 
- The \"BABY RAY\" with 3 piece chicken w/ gravy & onions and 2 waffles. He got the gravy & onions on the side to avoid it making the chicken soggy, which he was very thankful for as he did not like the gravy at all. I found the onions to be a nice touch, but also wouldn't have been happy with it smothered in it.

Overall, I have to say, being a fan of Roscoe's, my standards were set based off of them... which I honestly would have to say wasn't exactly up to par. Would we come back? Eh, yeah maybe in a few months if we ever have a chicken & waffle craving... but would we wait an hour for seating or risk coming when it's actually busy? Yeah, pass."}
{"text":"We went for my teen daughter's birthday. Our waiter was kind, knowledgeable and brought a slice of the best carrot cake with cream cheese frosting I have ever had as a birthday treat.  I would give five stars but there wasn't a lot of choices for non chicken eaters on the menu. Yes. I know the name.   My husband and daughter LOVED their French toast with fresh fruit and whipped cream. Chicken with waffles. My catfish nuggets were a tad undercooked. I didn't eat them all. They were a bit pricey. $10. But my family loved their food and I loved the cake. The restaurant is clean, bright and cheerful. A bit expensive but a nice treat."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! Despite the reviews on here, this place needs more than just five stars.. I found this place on Instagram and it is absolutely breath taking. The meal sizes are pretty big. In my opinion, this is by far better than Roscoes. My wife and I will definitely be coming here again next time we come to Vegas. The waitress that attended us was kind and was checking on us often. Great place!!"}
{"text":"I'm sad that I have to give Lolo's only two stars. We have been coming here almost ever weekend for a while now, and the service has always been pretty good. This morning we went for our usual breakfast, and showed up at nine, as soon as they opened. We were sat quickly, and ordered our food right away. We got our drinks in a short about of time, things were going as usual. Then, the time started dragging out. We had been there for almost an hour, and no food yet. I asked for the manager. He came over, didn't apologize, said he would go check on our food. He can back a couple minutes later, told us they were playing our food, again, no apology. 15 minutes later, our food came out and it was cold. The manager did not ever come back to our table to see if everything came out ok. On a positive note, our server did apologize, said they gave her 9 tables to service at the same time. We won't be back...makes me sad. I loved Lolo's :("}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Lo-Lo's. It was the best chicken & waffles I have ever had. The waffles have a very rich and homemade taste, unlike any waffle I have ever had. The waffles alone would be enough to make me return to this place, but then you add the fried chicken on top of that ! ! ! You get to pick which pieces of chicken you want with your waffle, which I really  like because I am NOT a fan of a chicken breast. I got two thighs. The crust on the chicken is amazing. Even tho the chicken is fried, it's not greasy. I knew I was going to order the chicken & waffles but I read over the entire menu. So many items on their menu sound delicious. We are looking forward to returning there for another meal and trying something different, including their appetizers. Our server was Chanel. The service was prompt and very friendly. I hope they open more of these restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"I visited with a group of 6. We were seated immediately but did not have anyone take our drink order until about 10 minutes later. We then placed our order. We waited for almost an hour to get our meal (visiting from out of state, transported via taxi)
The waffles were not hot, the chicken was hard. One of our guest had grits, the grits were completely solid!
I was disappointed. Our waitress did not check on us, management avoided us. I will not recommend this place to anyone. Customer service is not a priority"}
{"text":"My Mom and i visited this place for the first time on May 30th 2015. We were seated right away and the place was packed. I ordered the 3 pieces of chicken with gravy and onions with 2 waffles and mac and cheese. Mom ordered a breast of chicken and 1 waffle. We also ordered the fried pickles. The food was delicious but i was expecting big fluffy waffles they were not. I loved the Mac and cheese and the chicken. Oh and the fried pickles were the bomb. Service was good but took a long time to get food. I enjoyed it and would go back when not so crowded."}
{"text":"Great food & great service always at the bar. I've been here a 1/2 dozen times & they are always pretty quick & I'm always leaving happy."}
{"text":"So we went here to meet a friend for lunch. We were seated immediately and we waited for our friend. Our server got us drinks pretty quickly and we let her know that we were waiting on a friend. She checked in on us a few times while we were waiting. Once our friend met us, she took our order and that was the last time we saw of her for at least 30 minutes. 
Our food was super good. We got fingers and a waffle and it was delicious!
But unfortunately, the service dictated the review. The food was 4 stars but the service was 1 star. I met in the middle."}
{"text":"Decent at best.  The service was terrible, items charged on receipt that we didn't even order. I would go to the one downtown and stay clear of this one."}
{"text":"This was the first time coming to Lo-Lo's and unfortunately it would be the last due to the customer service received. Upon entering the patio, we took a seat. Instead of a warm greeting or \"Hello! Is this your first time here?\"...We received an immediate \"NO self seating.\" Okay, unfamiliar place  we looked for where to enter and waited to be seated. Food was okay but the tentativeness of our waitress was poor. We went to look for her to pay our check.. After searching for her and she asked for me to wait by the front desk. So I politely waited for her to return. A mother with a double stroller was exiting the restaurant so I moved aside. Another cashier yelled, \"You have to pay with YOUR Waitress.\" At this point very frustrated after waiting 15 minutes with the whole process of just trying to pay I stated \"That is what I'm trying to do!\" Another waitress looking over my shoulder and seeing how much I tipped.. disgusting. Never again, shame on you LoLos!"}
{"text":"Went here a cpl weeks ago with my co worker. We love roscoes so were excited to hear of a similar place out here in Vegas...the drinks and chicken were good but the waffles not so much. They were cinnamony and dry then when syrup was added they got super soggy and shredded apart. Maybe it was just a bad batch they were super busy so maybe the chef was rushed. But I still plan on going back to try more dishes! Tip for all u, call and reserve a spot ahead of time!! Especially if its for more than 4 people. We waited for 2 hrs for 7 of us."}
{"text":"If this place makes it past a year - I'll be in shock.

The food is good - the service is terrible."}
{"text":"Knock off BURNT microwave version of KFC. Coming from a southern girl, this is NOT soul food. Chicken has no seasoning & it's dry.The waffles are flat & soggy. Not fresh. The coffee is watered down.  I sent the chicken breast back because it was black. Server gave me a \"new\" piece which was exactly the same. Poor ghetto rude service. This place SUCKED from start to finish."}
{"text":"I was super excited to finally try LOLO's after attempting to go to the one on Central Ave in 2 different occasions (the wait was so long never made it in!) I was skipping through the parking lot ready for some chicken and waffles! The front staff were super friendly and explained there was a 45 minute wait, took our info and our wait turned out to be only about 20 minutes. It was opening day so the place was packed, luckily we got a seat on the patio because inside the dining area it was very packed and the tables are way too close to each other. The waitress was very friendly and tried hard but it was very busy. 
We ordered fried green tomatoes which were very good, the coating was a little bland but overall good. We also ordered fried gizzards which were way over salted. They brought the wrong appetizer originally but corrected it. Then our meal showed up after about 45 minutes. Fried chicken was moist but again, so so skin/breading. The waffle was thinner than I had expected and a little soft but tasty. The corn bread that accompanied the meal was out of this world delicious with kernels of corn and butter. I'd go back for just that! We also had Mac n cheese that was too thick. It was tasty but just a little thicker than I'd normally like. The fried okra was cooked perfectly but again the breading was almost tasteless. Overall I expected to be wowed by fantastic food and though I will try it again, I was a little disappointed. The staff were very friendly though and very helpful with what to try and kept our drinks full."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant on a Sunday, I had a hour and 45 minute wait service was horrible but the food was excellent"}
{"text":"The good was good as usual. It was very busy but we had fabulous service from Christopher.  He was great!!!"}
{"text":"I had their two waffle, three chicken piece, grit, egg combo. I also had their mac and cheese with a jar of sweet tea. I really liked the sweet tea because it had a strong black tea flavor along with a lot of sugar. The chicken was moist and tender, but did not have much flavor. There was one chicken breast, one leg, and one wing. I thought that the waffles were crispy, but also did not have much flavor. The grits were pretty flavorless too, but I think that's what grits are supposed to be like. The grits had a scoop of butter on top. It was my first time having grits. I think grits taste a little like white rice despite being made from corn. The eggs, which were cold, had mostly raw pieces of white onion pieces in it and some cheese on top. The eggs must have been made first before the chicken. The mac and cheese was creamy with a delicious Velveeta flavor. It took forever to get the meal, but I was also surprised at how long it took for the tea to come out as well. There were a lot of other patrons who waited a while for their food to come out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Absolutely hated it! Drove 25 minutes to get some old dry chicken, soft waffles, Mac & cheese mush and liquid diabetes kool aid.

I ordered and my food was out in 3 minutes. It takes longer to get chicken at a KFC drive thru, clearly the food was heated up and not fresh.  It wasn't busy either so I'm not too sure why they slacked.  

They get one star cause well I have to give one to comment but I will say the restaurant isn't ghetto it's actually pretty nice and In a good area, and the host was genuinely nice and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Sooooo Amazing, from the south and the grits were really good. The chicken is juicy, crispy, has the right amount of seasoning. Waffles A+ and Wife had the Red Velvet pancakes also amazing."}
{"text":"Yummy biscuits n gravy  chicken n waffles yummy. And windy kept all flavored of kool aid full!!!!!!A++++++****+"}
{"text":"I am in love with everything about this place. Nae Nae  is the best server ever. I recommend everyone thy this place at least once."}
{"text":"Food is great! I had the Betty boob and the sweet tea..  The wait to be seated was a little long and the service took longer than I would like but our server was really nice (the couple times she came to check on us). I will still go back though"}
{"text":"I have a new place to eat, the food was delicious. The place was clean and nice. The food was fresh and hot. I will be returning and this will be one of my new places to eat. If you live here your missing out. If you come to Vegas you got to try it, you will love it. Great prices and great service. Oh yea the cocktails was good tooooooo. What are you waiting for you, get to going you want regret it."}
{"text":"The worst most disgusting chicken tender I have ever had. And that's saying something. My chicken and waffles were poorly made , i don't ft the hype about this place and the gravy ..blahhh never again . I ordered via door dash"}
{"text":"OMG just terrible!  First it was'nt busy but we waited at least 10 minute just for the server to even come over. We get our food promptly, the 2 drumsticks i got were juicy but the chicken breast was the most overcooked dried out, you barely can break it open with your hands yuck! i mean imagine dried out deli chicken that has been sitting for a week, im serious! i also had rice with butter, its a small bowl of rice with about 3 tablespoons of butter just on top of it ridiculous cornbread was cold and stale, again another 3 tablespoons of butter on top it too everything was pretty bland,not be coming back"}
{"text":"Funny menu items, great concept..... horrible management and slow service. Won't be back. Would have been good if they picked it up and we had gotten our food a bit quicker it wouldn't have been dry then the Las Vegas weather"}
{"text":"Waffles rock...service was great!  Hot sauce is special. Rest of the food and the drinks were meh...and over priced... Save your money or choose wisely. But hey, I'm from the South, so I expect good fried chicken, this was not that. Also they didn't let you substitute sides, major downer."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Came in, waited to be seated with multiple open tables. Once seated, not one person came to take even a drink order. After 15 mins of waiting, asked for a manager. After 10 mins no manager ever came to the table. I watched someone be seated after us and get their drinks. No one waitress or waiter even made eye contact with us!! BAD SERVICE"}
{"text":"Was seated promptly. I had the Betty Boob which was delicious. Chicken was crispy and seasoned just right. The waffle was tasty and I enjoyed the bit of cinnamon they add to set it apart. I also ordered a side of okra which was nicely fried and some cheesy grits. The grits were nice and creamy.
Will def be making this a regular place!"}
{"text":"Great food thanks you Sparky for the great service you gave our family you made it more enjoyable   And its worth driving to try it out"}
{"text":"Very long wait and slow service but they just opened this location. Great food and a great location. Bloody Mary's not so good."}
{"text":"Decent food tried thee shrimp n grits corn fritters mac n cheese n chicken n waffles... Service was good. They were out of the kool aid when i went unfortunately. But i will say the shrimp n grits were one of the best I've had outside of my own. Mac n cheese had  good flavor , waffles were soft like stated in another review like a pancake i would prefer mine to have a slight crisp so may wanna ask to cook alil longer if this is u. My chicken wing was excessively cooked but still decent  . Will give another try n would recommend"}
{"text":"I thought we had a solid chicken and waffle meal. Wife had the shrimp and grits. All was delicious and well prepared. Her biscuit was awesome. Not exactly a healthy meal but delicious. We ordered a few of the drinks based on kool aid. Can't go wrong with that. 

The service was great. They were very busy but efficient. We sat outside, monsters worked great for the evening."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant 3 stars because the atmosphere is wonderful but the food wasn't that good. The chicken & waffles were of course good & the corn fritters were amazing but the actual soul food wasn't what i expected. It was overall just okay."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic however, the service was really really bad! Prior to visiting, I read the reviews and the majority of the patrons had the same complaint. We (3 in party) ordered our food at 12:58pm and received it at 1:38pm. When the food arrived, we were exiting our booth however, the server encouraged us to stay. 

Based upon the serving time, one of the plates were cold and had to be returned. I spoke to the server and voiced my complaint and she said the kitchen was short handed. 

Usually when food is returned, the manager visits the table, apologize and offer some kind of commiserate. In this instance, the manager never visited which was shocking. I inquired and discovered he was assisting in the kitchen. 

Sorry to say, I will not be recommending this restaurant because of the service. However, if the manager had visited, I would have recommended the restaurant based upon GP. 

The server (Starr) was great however, she could not compensate for a slow, understaffed and unorganized kitchen. 

If you visit, be prepared to sit ten minutes before ordering and an additional thirty minutes to receive your food! 

My son and his girlfriend who are locals, complained about the same thing and said that they visited once and haven't returned. 

If you visit and don't received your food within 15-20 minutes run  ? don't walk, RUN away!"}
{"text":"So, this place is really good. There was so much to choose from.. i actually went in to inquire about a barenders gig they had posted on indeed. Friendly staff.  I ordered the shrimp and grits,  with hot links on the side, extra extra burnt.. delish!!! Of course i ordered more than i could eat.. oh, i forgot to mention, the GREEN APPLE KOOLAID!!! So good yall.. but like i stated before, i ordered more than i could eat at the time.  

I went to the wash room, leaving my portfolio sitting on the table.. when i came back, my food was gone, but there was a fresh glass of koolaid left on the table,  with my check next to it... so I waited for Sparkey, my server to come back with my food in a to go container.. he never did,  so i stood up and he came by to tell me that he takes care of the check.. i asked him, where is my food... he said , \"oh, i threw it in the trash\".. took the check book out of my hand and proceeded to go to the computer to finalise the bill... i asked, so you throw my food away, and expect me to pay this full bill? He said \"yes, i thought you had left\".. im like...\"but my stuff was still on the table, and you left me a fresh glass if koolaid\", hes now showingly pissed.. i said \"you throw my food in the trash, without closing out with me, and your pissed about it?\" He says you can talk to my manager..... the manager comes, and tells me that they will make me another meal... no sir.. its cold in here,  and i don't have time to wait for you guys to cook it, i have somewhere to be... he told me that i must pay the bill.... i did.  I asked how long has sparky been serving.. thats when i was told that after the incident with my food.. he snapped at the hostesses about folding napkins. 

Ive never had my food thrown out and had to pay for it... never.. there was a full bowl of shrimp and grits left, i had only eaten four bites.. the bowl is hughe! But what gets me is that my belongings were still at the table, and he had given me a fresh glass of koolaid.. but, he says he thought id left without paying my bill...

Any one else would have lost their minds about this... ive never had this happen to me.. there was a woman in the restroom with her disabled mother trying to get the mom together.. but i was not away from the table long enough to throw my food away.. and if my things were still there... why would he, without asking me?"}
{"text":"Great chicken,excellent atmosphere and to top it off. You can catch a glimpse of NBA hall of farmer.  Kevin Johnson, it's a win/win."}
{"text":"Ate here when they first opened and it was delicious. The second time.... what a disappointment!!! The food was served warm not hot and the chicken pieces were way too large and the outside was burned. The Chicken pieces were so big that they had that grizzle and large pieces of fat that you cannot eat."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Sat down and waited 15-20 minutes and no one came to even take our drink order. The place was pretty much empty btw so I know them being busy couldn't have been an excuse. Ended up just leaving."}
{"text":"I really wish I had a photo to go with this review but once I dug in nothing was going to stop me. I went with the #5 I believe the \"Sheeda's special\"? Comes with a wing, breast and one waffle with a generous scoop of butter which I love. The breast was a bit dry but it's nothing that would ever stop me from ordering it again. I also got a side of collard greens that has a little kick to it and they were great. I'm a big fan of chicken and waffles and this place really does it right in my opinion. I really can't believe the overall rating they have. It's a cool place very casual and came recommend while here for spring training/ house hunting. I dig the flat screens with games on, cool looking bar and outdoor seating and it is a really cool touch with the family photos I love supporting a family owned business. I look forward to becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and waffles are good. The service can be better. Got the blue kool-aid was really sweet and first but after the ice melted tasted like a nice Gatorade."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles.  This only think keeping from a five star is the noise level here is crazy.  Sound just echos here.  Food is bomb."}
{"text":"I rather go to Popeyes. 

Weirdest service of my life from beginning to the end. As we entered, there was an ample amount of staff but yet we were ignored. We stared at the hostess and another worker just chilling at the counter for a good 7 minutes and tried to say hi before they acknowledged us. She then rolled her eyes & asked if there was 4 of us, peered over the counter to see open tables, and yelled there's a booth over there...but then she didn't seat us....we just stood there awkwardly and she yelled another worker over and said sit them at that booth and the worker said \"I ain't a hostess\" and she yelled back \"you are today!\" Then we were handed menus as we were walking & then seated at the wrong booth. We sat around another 15 mins before someone asked us for our drink order and when we tried to order our server knew nothing about the menu...the menu has literally like 20 items....we tried to call over 7 wait staff just to get some sauces for our chicken as well as the missing order and no one acknowledged us. As we paid our check for the slowest service in our lives we didn't even care to get our extra change back because we knew it would take forever. Then he put the money down on our table and started counting it? Wtf

Chicken was dry af but the sides were delicious. They are known for their chicken so I was confused. Definitely try there corn fritters, fried green beans, and candy sweets. Fruit punch kool aid that tasted like watermelon jolly ranchers was a nice touch."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cold food servers that always are complaining to each other and tasteless food this will be the place for you 30 minutes fried gizzards and never got my fries good luck talk to other other diners they too also had luke warm food fix the kitchen or get out"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here, it was very memorable. Today was my second time eating at this place. My boyfriend and I brought two friends with us so they could try it out. However, for some reason this place completely changed my perspective. We regret recommending to eat here. We waited for 45 minutes to get our food served and by that time our appetite was gone. Then, when our food was served, the order was wrong and incomplete! On top of that, people who arrived and ordered after us got there food served first and we didn't even order that much food. Plus, we also had to keep asking and reminding our server for our extra sides. Our waitress barely checked on us and management could've cared less. We definitely received a bad service over all. For that reason I highly do not recommend for anyone to eat here and believe me when I say I am not coming back to eat at this place."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here since it opened and just never made it until Sunday. I met a friend for drinks and appetizers. I will start on a positive note. The waitress was very nice and attentive and brought everything out fairly quickly, it was really slow there, so that might have helped. When she brought our order, catfish, fried okra and most importantly fried green tomatoes, they had mistakenly given us fried green beans. When we informed waitress of mistake, she did replace the green beans, but made me scoop them off plate to give back to her. It was really weird. The few times in my life that order was wrong, they just fixed it and left whatever was incorrect. It didn't really bother me at first, but the more I thought about it, the more I wondered if they were going to pass it off to another customer. The okra and tomatoes were not very good, but the fish was quite tasty. I hope none of it was another customer's leftovers or rejects I won't be going back to find out!"}
{"text":"When I go to a place that has a name Chicken and Waffles  i expect great chicken. Not so.. Breast very dry and tastless, buttered cheese grits cold, fried Okra limp and bland. On the good side the corn bread was ok. we ordered cobbler and after 10minutes the waitress advised that it had been taken by someone else and that another would be very ready in 8 minutes. we declined and left.  Bad food and bad service. I  will not return."}
{"text":"Decided to try it and I ended up ordering the salad I love how they serve your beverage on a mason jar and staff is super polite"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. There wee six of us and everyone's good was great. Our gang always tries each other's meals! The only suggestion is that it would be great if they offered a rotisserie style chicken. My wife tries not to eat fried foods.  
We'll definitely be back !"}
{"text":"This was the first time eating here and it was pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon but we were hungry so we sat down and ordered. I ordered Fried Green Tomatoes, Chicken and Waffles and my hubby orders the Biscuits and gravy.  We both enjoyed our meals so much and had leftovers to have later.  I had been craving fried green tomatoes for a good little while and I was truly satisfied with this part of my meal and the chicken was fried just right very tasty.  The biscuits were cake like and that gravy was yummy.  My hubby and I have a date morning every Saturday and we are always looking for a good breakfast and I think we may have found our new spot!"}
{"text":"Went for my niece birthday, good experience. We were nervous because of the service coming in the door and miscommunication of timing. Restaurant is open Sundays till 6pm not 8pm. Our waitress Chevy made up for the not so great start! She was wonderful and extremely help. Manager came over to be sure services were great. The food was good and the Kool-aid was ok. We will be going back to try other items. We had chicken and waffles, worth it."}
{"text":"This would be my go-to chicken place if I lived in the area. This is a nice sit-down place while also having good chicken. I got two chicken thighs and it was good. The chicken breading was well seasoned. I wished the waffle was thicker and more crispy. I personally would pass on the waffle and just get more chicken. I also got a side of biscuit and sausage and gravy; this was a little overpriced, approx. $4.50 but it was good and they slathered the biscuit with gravy"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a place to get good fried chicken and found lo lo's. looked like a very nice restaurant from the outside. We were seated and almost got up and left apparently we were seated in an unassigned table after 7 mins of no service all of a sudden Nae Nae to us by storm. She was on top of. She apologized up down she turned the experience around in a matter of seconds. The food was excellent it was superb we will remember the waitress as much as we remember the food. 5 stars for Lo Lo's and 6 stars for Nae Nae can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"The food is good and they serve big portions! Chicken is very flavorful. I didn't give it a 5 because of the bad service. Took 10 minutes for a server to even stop by our table to take our drink order."}
{"text":"Crap! Pure and simple. Don't waste your time!  Service, food, atmosphere. Garbage!
Phoenix needs to come up with their own idea because copying others isn't working!"}
{"text":"Waited for 20 - 25 minutes to be seated.  The restaurant was only half full and we're the only ones waiting.  Once another group arrived, they finally seated us.  Waited another 10-15 minutes without anyone asking us anything or even if we want water.  When we saw one of the waitress served the other party that came after us, we knew we weren't wanted.  We did sense that they kinda looked down on us when we first arrived and they told us to wait.  Coincidentally, my friend told me that a friend of hers was also treated rudely.  The only thing we have in common is that we're both Asians.  In any case, I won't recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Great place with outstanding service. We are from Los Angeles and are used to eating at Roscoe's. If you like Roscoe's you will love Lo-Lo's. The chicken was tender and juicy. Delicious Kool Aid flavors  that are never ending. The cornbread is tasty and the service is friendly. Must go when your in Vegas. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"I have heard friends rave about Lo-los for years so I was looking forward to going. Sadly, I was very disappointed. I am willing to cut them slack for being new at this location so the super slow, hectic service was not a major problem. My son ordered a hamburger.Fries were extra---never heard of that. Guess they wanted him to order a waffle. I ordered salmon croquettes that came with grits. Got a side of collard greens. Croquettes and grits were tasteless. I was born and raised in the South so I know what they should taste like. Thank goodness for the greens. They were outstanding! Add in a soft drink and a glass of wine and the bill hit $47. Don't mind paying that much, but the food has to be a lot better than this was."}
{"text":"LoLo's chicken is amazing. Juicy inside, light and crispy outside... it's perfection. I can't comment on the waffles because I don't get them. I always order a single breast with a side of gravy and some cheese grits. Yummy! 

I've had great service at the Scottsdale and Gilbert locations. The manager usually comes around to check on us at the Gilbert location, which is a nice touch, and if we've ever had an issue it's been solved cheerfully and immediately."}
{"text":"We waited for 45 minutes  to get seated and were still waiting when we left.   Asked to speak with manager and he had plenty of excuses short staff etc... but still not seated.   They have hired a manager and hostesses that don't appear to care if you wait to be seated or leave.   Very disappointed in this restaurant as we had eaten in Phoenix and loved the food and service."}
{"text":"Better than Roscoes!!!! If you want that authentic soul food, go to lolo's! Their chicken is so good and the waffles taste like dessert on its own. I LOVE getting the greens and beans on rice on the side."}
{"text":"I'm super bummed that the Gilbert Lolo's is such a disappointment. I loved the old Scottsdale location, this one leaves much to be desired. We tried it once, when they first opened in May, and the service was awful. It took way too long to get our appetizers, and even longer to get our meal. Then once we did get our food, we couldn't begin eating because we didn't have any condiments. By the time the condiments arrived, the food was cold. We never got our drinks refilled. We were ignored for the most part. It was a 2 hour meal, on a school night, and my kids were unhappy, I was unhappy and my husband was unhappy. We decided to try again last night, without the kids. It was a bad experience again. While the service wasn't quite as bad, they found additional ways to ruin the meal. First of all, they sat us right next to door (when there were plenty of other tables open). My husband and I ordered and they came back and said they were out of burgers. He made an alternate choice, and a few moments before they were bringing out his meal, they informed us that a key ingredient in his sandwich (the bread) was also unavailable....I'm sorry what? So they put his sandwich on a sesame seed bun. Not a big deal, but still. If you are out of something, let people know before hand. My meal was ok. Not great, just ok. It's not cheap food. It was $50 for the two of us, my expectations should be met. And $3.50 for a jar of kool-aid?! But after two things my husband wanted, they still didn't offer to comp part of the meal. We gave it a try, but will not be returning."}
{"text":"The customer service is incredible! They were more attentive than ANY other restaurant I've ever been to. The food was perfect, and the atmosphere was highly professional, & welcoming! I will definitely be spreading the word & will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Just came for Mother's Day breakfast with my grandma and it was good! This was my second time at this location and both times have been tasty. I always come at off times to minimize the wait but you can check the NoWait app to see what the wait is. Shay was our server today and he was very attentive and timely! It was a great experience with my family and I will def be coming again and again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dining experience at lo-lo's.  Felt welcome as soon as I walked in.  Our server Tinisha was great!  Very friendly and helpful...asked about the Mac and cheese and she brought a sample to the table to try it out!  
    Started out with some corn fritters...a tasty way to start things off.  Nicely spicy, although the accompanying honey mustard could've used some help from an alternative sauce to mix it up a bit.  
    For the main event I ordered chicken and a waffle with sweet potatoes and corn bread.  Sweet potatoes were okay, but unfortunately they were out of corn bread at the time so we were served a homemade biscuit instead.  The biscuit was huge!  The waffle was huge and delicious as well, but my favorite part was the chicken.  Nice crispy skin and juicy inside.  Some of the best fried chicken I've had in a while.  All in all a very satisfying meal.  
     After we were done eating Tinisha brought us to-go drinks and the corn bread that wasn't available earlier.  She really made it a great experience.  Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I heard the food was good. It smelled good as it was being served to others all around us. What I'm trying to say is, we were never served!!! My husband and I went in earlier this week 2/9/16 and sat by the bar and took about 5 minutes to read through a menu that made our mouths water. We placed our order with a waitress that was fairly pleasant and brought us our water. My husband and I got into a heated discussion that distracted us from the fact that 20 minutes rolled by and no food. When I checked the time and realized its been 20 minutes since we ordered we started really observing food coming in and out of the kitchen but nothing to our table. We also counted and realized there were 4 different groups of people that came in after us and they got their food. Finally the waitress comes by and says that they were frying my catfish and wanted to make sure it was done right. Come on now! Catfish don't take that long!!! After waiting for 40 minutes total we decided to get up and leave. As we walked towards the door a lady(employee) ran up to us saying no no don't leave yet! She grabbed my husband's shoulder and my arm (highly inappropriate) to stop us from walking out. She said something like please don't leave I'm sorry I will get your check.  I'm assuming she meant she'd comp the meal for being incompetent. I calmly said we were done and my husband and I walked out.
 A. Who was she? 
B. Where did she come from? 
C. If she knew there was an issue with our meals why didn't she come to our table to address it before?

Bad service!!! Terrible! They weren't even busy enough to justify that faux pad!!!

Too bad! I had high hopes for this place since It opened up down the street from my home.
By the way I gave it 1 star because the water was refreshing."}
{"text":"Horrendous. I went with my roommate for the first time to try the food & was excited at first. The ambience was great and I couldn't wait to try the food. 
Then the server came, gave us a minute so we can finally decide and after that it took us 45 minutes to get our food. 
I lost my patience and my appetite because,
That was after she had only checked up on us ONCE within that time frame and only offered one refill for my roommate. I would not have been that mad but the restaurant wasn't even that busy. 
Not only did I have to ask another server if our food was backed up, but the manager came and didn't even give me a chance to respond. 
It's like the servers and the manager came by to say what they had to say without even checking up on us and then leaving as to not give us a chance to ask for anything. 

Not only that but multiple tables that came after us  had gotten their food and drinks/refills before we did. 

When I called for one of the servers she kept telling me no before I even asked a question or said anything. 

The food was great but it definitely didn't make up for the lack of service,  and the rude employees. 
I raised my hand several times just to get the attention of anybody working and nobody came. I'm usually patient at restaurants because I am a part of the restaurant business myself but this type of service was unacceptable. 
Finally when we were done eating our server was fast to our attention when dealing with the check as it seemed she wanted to get rid of us as soon as she could. I didn't feel welcomed at all. 

I was excited and ready to eat my food but my first experience here was totally ruined, and my roommate and I will not find ourselves coming back. 

1/5"}
{"text":"We love LoLo's chicken and waffles more than Roscoe's! I will say when they first opened the service was not that great and they were not organized, but each time we have been back the service has improved. The food is always great and the portions are right in line with their pricing. I always get the Betty's boob and it breast portion is always a DD breast size...lol. Their bathroom is always clean as is their restaurant. My only critique is the greeters could be more friendly they seem like they are never in a good mood when we come in. 

The last time we were there, my husband mentioned that it was our daughter's birthday and the server and some other staff member's came and sang to her and gave her a free slice of cake. That to me is great customer service!"}
{"text":"Service so slow, bad, inept I didn't have a chance to eat.......and I won't be back.  Management better get it together or it will go down."}
{"text":"The service was so slow, that this is what I'm choosing to start my review with. 

I think what made us most irritable was that in addition to the slow service, there was a huge lack of communication in letting us know whatever was hindering our food from coming out. We did speak with the manager, who was super nice...so that and the food flavor/quality is why I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 1. 

We came in after what appeared to be a lunch rush, but the place was not extraordinarily packed when we sat down. My party of 4 was eventually greeted and our drink orders were taken. It took a little long to get our drinks, but nothing crazy... nothing like what we were about to experience. 

After putting in our order we watched as multiple tables came in and sat down and got their food around us, yet we were still food-less. These were parties of various sizes as well and who appeared to have ordered the same types of things we ordered. Matter of fact, one of the orders within my party was a med cooked burger! We continued to watch as everyone got their food and had made eye contact with our server a couple times, hoping to get her to come tell us why our food was taking so long. She never did. We actually ended up speaking with a manager about the issue and it wasn't until then that we actually got our food. When our food was being brought to our table though, we noticed that the burger was missing. What in the world?! Also, my chicken was COLD! After waiting over 45minutes for food and it was cold? Nope. 

The manager had offered up a discount but, we explained, that was not what we were after. We would have been somewhat okay (I'm still upset at my 45minute COLD chicken) had the server communicated properly and treated us how those around us were being treated. It is still unclear to me why our server did not take care of us the same way that the other tables were being taken care of... and here's the kicker... she sent over another server to drop the check! 

The worst part was that I'm not even sure if the food was good enough for me to return."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit this restaurant, the service is questionable at best.  I ordered 5 peach cobblers to go and about 30 minutes later they only have one left. I took the one and waited and additional 30 minutes for a refund and 1 peach cobbler. Attention to details are not their strong suit. Oh well, Happy Mothers day anyway."}
{"text":"I've been hearing good things about Lolo's food for over a year now, so I was excited to finally get the chance to try it out Sat.evening 3/31..To start, the staff was very friendly and helpful to my girlfriend and i, we got a nice size order, to go ,so when they told us the wait would be 30min It was understandable. We decided to sit at the bar and have a drink while we waited...the Bartender was cool and busted a few jokes but as far as the service, it seemed as if his attention was focused on too many things. .running back and forth to the kitchen and employees asking questions WHILE taking bar orders... I noticed the couple opposite the bar from us looked upset for some reason and left  angrily.. right at that moment I noticed 30min had come and gone, we had been waiting for 54min at this point ( This was not a very busy time of the day),  I continued to remain calm until I started looking for a waitress. .there's not a waitress/server/hostess in site, the only people visible were a bar back and two server/waitresses about to leave for the day (one being our order taker )...I finally say to  the bar back \"I've been waiting for my food for an hour now, can I speak to your manager please? !\" He leaves for 2 min and out walks the bartender who I guess is also the manager?? He explains to me, \"sorry man, we had a Lil meeting out back\"..\"A LIL MEETING!?!IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY? !THE WHOLE STAFF DAMN NEAR? NOW I'M OFFICIALLY PI**ED OFF and I let it be known. The manager said he was going to get my order, he comes back out and asks me \"what did you order again???\" Now I'm SUPER PI**ED, I start to raise hell at this point, embarrassing my girlfriend. The manager goes BACK into the kitchen and comes out in a couple minutes with my order. If not for my girlfriend i would have told them to give me a refund! I grab my food and get the hell out of there. As we were leaving the parking lot we notice a minimum of 6 employees hanging out in the back of the restaurant.. SMH.. We get home and open our to go boxes to soggy pancakes, cold chicken (we live 10 minutes away) Luke warm grits and eggs..most of the food we ordered, being a fan of \"Soul Food\", was just ok..... the greens I give a 7/10,  Mac N Cheese and fish were good... Maybe the food would have been better if it didn't seem like it was sitting, bagged in the kitchen for 30min before we got it.  I was very disappointed in this place, especially with all the good things I heard about it. I suggest Better management and better training of your employees. I will not return nor recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am here about once every 6 weeks for a random weekday brunch. Not as crowded, but you will still have to wait a while for your food. (Worth the wait, hold yourself over with one of their adult Kool Aid Drinks)

Tips: Wings are the best here, breast tends to taste bland after the crunchy skin, juicy, but bland.

2 or more? Skip individual mimosas and get the bottle and a side of oj. The mimosa glasses are child size and run about 7.50 each. Or go during bottomless mimosa hours

Best alchohol bang for your buck? Anything with Kool-Aid bro. Trust me.

Last but NOT least. The smothered potaotes, I would pawn my Grannys TV for a side order. That good!"}
{"text":"If you like southern food, this ain't the place. Having lived in the south and having legit chicken and waffles, what I had at lo los was bisquick waffles and worse that KFC fried chicken.  The batter wasn't seasoned at all. I HAD TO SALT FRIED CHICKEN PEOPLE. Wrong on so many levels. Don't waist your time and go to Nicos down the way."}

{"text":"Having visited the location in Scottsdale, my husband and I were thrilled to learn a location was going to be right around the corner from our house in Gilbert. Needless to say, we will continue to drive to the Scottsdale location rather than waste our time, money and patience at this Gilbert location.  Whomever bought the Gilbert franchise is running the name into the ground.
1.) Understaffed from day 1- Only half of the dining area and patio had patrons seated. There were more people waiting OUTSIDE the restaurant for a table than seated inside and yet we are told it is a 2 hour wait for a table
2.) Rude hostess with the 80s bangs- grim, ticked off attitude- could care less if you put your name down or not- finally received text that our table was ready after 2 hours- when our party made our way to the hostess stand she said it would another 10 minutes until the other hostess could seat us
3.) Waitstaff is incompetent and dishonest - took our order and never checked back on our table for 45 minutes, finally once my husband flagged her down and asked why the table that was seated 30 minutes after us already got their food- waitress went to \"check on the order\" she then said it would be ANOTHER 10 minutes (suspect she never put the order in)
4.) Not everyone in party got to eat- after THREE hours of waiting for a table/waiting for food- it finally arrived! Sort of-- my entree was missing a side dish, my husband never received silver ware, my niece asked for sour cream 4 times, we had to ask 3 times for SYRUP and my father's sandwich never came!! We all were half way through our dinner when the waitress came out to ask my father if he could just \"order something else quicker because they forgot to make his chicken club sandwich and now it would take too long to prepare\"  WTF?!?!?!?!?  

Never again .......................STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION"}
{"text":"I love chicken and waffles and this place is great.  I love the crispy chicken! I just don't like the waffle because I can taste cinnamon but I still like to go back because of the fast and great service."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see Lo-Lo's had a new location near me, having never tried it before. I had heard a lot of buzz about this place and how amazing it was, but after checking it out myself, I will NEVER be back! I had gone in for lunch with my family on a Friday afternoon, the 30 minute wait for our table was bearable. Our server wasn't terrible, but he wasn't great either. Our food took almost an hour to get out to us, and he blamed it on the chef rather than just apologizing. My mother ordered the shrimp and grits, and her shrimp was extremely overcooked and just plain awful. I ordered the Lo-Lo chicken and waffle dish, and was extremely disappointed. My chicken was very dry, had NO flavor, and my waffle was nothing special. Now I've had chicken and waffles before, not at Lo-Lo's, and I enjoyed it very much. But this place cannot make a decent dish of chicken and waffles if their lives depended on it, which was surprising considering that's what they are known for. I will be NOT be coming back here EVER. MANAGERS/OWNERS/EMPLOYEES, IF YOURE READING THIS: PLEASE FIX THIS MESS OF A PLACE THAT YOU CALL A RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to Lo-Lo's in downtown Gilbert. I would say we've been between 5-10 times, and each time service has been great. Food also comes out quick, and always tastes great. We thinks prices are fair as well! We would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of buzz about this place for awhile now and I decided that it was time to try it this place out. I started off with the sweet tea and when they meant sweet... oh my lord was it EXTREMELY sweet, It was as if I was drinking syrup! But luckily our server Ryan was kind enough to swap my drink with unsweetened tea without charging extra, thanks Ryan, you're the MVP. I ordered the \"Betty's Boob\" and a side of fried green beans. The chicken breast was pretty dry to be honest but I guess that's to be expected when eating white meat but the waffle tasted good. The fried green beans were bomb however why are they $7???? I get it, your green beans are good but not that good. 

Overall thoughts: This place was overhyped and I honestly would not recommend It, but unless you like dry chicken and sweet tea that will most likely give you diabetes then come on in! *sidenote* Although our server was great, I noticed that service among other customers was not that great."}
{"text":"This place was just awful.  
The grits were sour.  
The waffles were soggy and floppy

And the sister onelet let me explain:
A wad of extra oily mushrooms and spinach and onion was topped with a 1/2\" thick hard cooked egg \"omelet\" 

Are you serious?

Three people $70

What a joke"}

We even over heard the people behind us make a comment about the smell, as well. We requested to move to the dining area, where they sat us in a booth that had not been cleaned from the previous night. The server Drei took our order and we never saw her again until we asked for the check. The bus boy was incredible. He brought out the food (brought out the over easy eggs they forgot which turned out to be over cooked and other condiments needed), brought our drinks and provided refills, and was super apologetic and polite! 

Place was dirty, heavily smelled like marijuana, and was just an overall uncomfortable experience."}

{"text":"Didn't get a chance to eat here since they don't allow outside food or drinks even though I explained that my son is on a special diet for medical reasons. Their reasoning is you might blame them later saying you got sick because of their food. Well I can also say that their policy is a discrimination against people with special diet or their families. We went to 3 other places in the same area and they have no similar policy. Well not my loss."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWFUL. I wish I could put a negative rating. We were told, when we finally were able to get to the front desk through all the people, that it would be a 20-30 minute wait. Which was fine, but after 45 minutes we eventually tried to seat ourselves at the bar & were ignored for another 10-15 minutes with a disgusting, dirty bar in front of us. We decided to get back on he list for a table & were finally seated after a bit. We watched 3 other tables that were sat after us get their drinks & food orders in before anyone ever greeted us. Once we finally were able to place our order, our spicy corn fritters came out ice cold in the middle. The waitress took them away & brought the same ones back out, just fried a little longer. I ordered the salmon croquettes & they smelled really fishy (which usually means bad/old fish) but hardly had any real fish in them. Just lots of stuffing & inedible pieces of who-knows-what. The grits were MOSTLY butter, hardly any grits. Meanwhile, they look like they have a full staff but no one knows what to do at all. Not sure how they got a grade 'A' on their health inspection on 1/23 because it was all pretty gross. This was, without a doubt, the worst dining experience I've ever had. Do yourself a favor & don't go here."}
{"text":"Excellent fried chicken. Not greasy.  Moist.  Breakfast came with grits and eggs.  Waffles had cinnamon or something.  Very good.  Eggs were cooked with onion and cheese.

{"text":"My first experience at LoLo's was in Phoenix about 4 years ago...  What a good plate of food I had- it was the best- fun, delicious, and different.  I learned about the Gilbert location and decided to bring my family to taste the goodness for them selves.  Here's how it went:  we arrived at 10:30 or so, waited in with six people in front of us for about 20 min.  Even though the restaurant was only about 50% occupied.  But I'm not about to let it bother me at that point- we get seated and order waters- 15 min. later they appeared, I should have read the writing on the wall at that point and ordered a pizza but my 3 kids were excited about the chicken and waffles so we put in an order for 6 of the same thing- chicken & waffles and a refill of waters, the waters never came, but 1-1/2 hours later we received 4 out of 6 of our food orders.  When I asked what the ETA was on the other 2, the answer was \"it could be 15min. to an hour\".  During our stay I asked the bartender what the deal was and he said he was going to quit...  We paid, and got back to normal life, no discounts of course..  It was an odd experience, as we left, the line to get in was 50 people deep but the restaurant had a dozen or so empty tables. 

Food was delicious though..."}
{"text":"For 06/11/17

We come in and are seated. We wait about 20mins to get drinks. But what made us walk out was that we were blatantly ignored by the server. She proceeded to serve a larger group you were seated after us. Even the people at the bar were looking at us weird because we weren't being acknowledged. Don't waste your time or money here. There are plenty of other places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Had the ABSOLUTE worst experience at LoLos. 

My family has been fans of LoLos for a few years now. When the location opened up in Gilbert we were overjoyed and frequent this location. I had family in town from Sacramento and we decided to take them to LoLos for the first time. I had assumed this would be a safe recommendation since we have been here so often. I don't know what part of this story is worse. The fact my boyfriend found a hair on his waffle or my cousin finding a MOTH in her chicken tender plate. We were all mortified! The server was so embarrassed and said she would take the plates off of our check. As someone who works in customer service I was mostly disappointed in the manager who came over to us. All he said was \"Hey guys I heard we had some unpleasant experiences with our plates. I'm sorry about that.\" That was it!! How could you just shrug it off that there was not only a dead moth in our food but hair as well! We are never going to LoLos again which is really disappointing considering it was a favorite of ours. Really hope they get their stuff together."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm being generous because of Rouyon's good customer service. But, as for the food itself, well let's just say that the chicken was bland, my burger was medium well when I asked for well done and the drinks were watery. Other than that, the Stupid fries were good and the waffles were okay. That was the only saving grace for this experience."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here at your bar for 18 minutes now and I haven't been greeted, you have 2 servers standing on the side rolling silver ware, a hostess who's just standing there, no bartender, no manager present, a cook who's clearing tables while servers stand around! This is my 3 rd time coming here and it's the same every time! If it wasn't for the great kitchen staff cooking good food I would never come here! Cause the FOH staff needs an absolute face lift! Food I rate a 5 star if I could but the service is horrible! A server finally greeted but only to tell me he would be right with me but then never returned! So after 25 minutes of no service I walked out! As I'm leaving 4 staff members notice me leaving but no one made an effort to say anything! I'm a restaurant manager myself so I know the struggles of short staff and being busy but this was note the case on 7/8/17 @1245p.m. Thank your kitchen staff for saving this place I'll be back just for the food and give another try maybe the service will be better or if we get any!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch to go. My food came out quick and was delicious. Best wings ever. I did order a drink from the bartender while waiting which took an awful long time, therfore 3 stars."}
{"text":"Food was really just ok, but good enough to come back and try something else. Thin waffles were soggy but tasty, chicken was a good texture but needed seasoning. Greens were not to my liking, too mushy. Good iced tea and kool-aid. Service was great :-)"}
{"text":"Literally just sat here for 20 minutes without any of the 50 waiters coming to help me. The host sat me down and no one greeted me after that. Ended up just leaving after 20 minutes of waiting and trying to get anyone's attention. One star."}
{"text":"Went for the hype despite all the negative things I've heard. The customer service is terrible. Waffle is flavored with cinnamon and tastes amazing but is really dense. I was so sad with the chicken, they let you choose which pieces you want. I went with breast, thigh, and wing.. but they were unbearably salty I couldn't even finish one piece. I'm from California and I have eaten at roscoes many times, which has set the bar pretty high.
They did have good tasting side dishes though..
(Mac n cheese, whipped potatoes)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  Service seems to be hit or miss, although usually the food takes a long time to come out.  Tonight, service was very poor.  Also, my wife and I both had fried chicken which was extremely dry.  After finally getting a hold of our server, he did replace one of the pieces. It was just too little too late.  Overall a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I decided that it was time to check out Lolo's since everyone raved about their chicken and waffles. As a recent SoCal transplant I wanted to make a Roscoe's comparison and was seriously craving some soul food! I was not let down! The chicken and waffles here are TO DIE FOR! I love the thin waffle paired with the crispy fried chicken and all their sides are delicious! The portions are sizable and everything we have tasted on the menu is on point. My kids love the red velvet pancakes and we have enjoyed many items including the chorizo and eggs, as well as the KK and other items off the \"hood classics\" menu selection. We always lead full, with leftovers and a smile on our faces! The service is good, at times it could be faster but all in all this spot quickly became a family fave! Patio dining during the fall and spring is my fave!"}
{"text":"I really loved Lolo's. First off I was seated w a young lady Desiree. She new the menu well and I ordered shrimp and grits. The first time I had it it was spicy and the lil girl suggested I get the Tabasco on the side. Great recommendation. The teamwork was neat to see everyone helping each other. Moo laid a lil sw wee but sugar never hurt anyone. I will go back again to take my son."}
{"text":"Ok food, just ok...horrible service and expensive equals my lowest review.  No reason to go here except to read a southern menu with ghetto style copy write.  Oh yeah, drinks are over priced and leave the bar accurately 50% of the time."}
{"text":"We came here on what seem to be the busiest day ever with over an hour wait to be seated.  This day I believe was the first day all menu items were available, so sort of a grand opening (hence the wait) not sure how it is on any other day.  

Once inside the restaurant we were greeted with the delightful aromas of fried chicken and waffles and friendly staff. 

I love waffles and I love fried chicken, however, I have never been a fan of them together. Unfortunately this wouldn't be the time I tell you I have converted either.  

The fried chicken was amazing and I would definitely come back for the chicken, but the waffles??? The waffles were so underwhelming I could not get past two bites.   They were floppy soft and to cinnamon flavored.  Just awful! We also ordered a corn bread muffin which was inedible, dry and hard. 

I loved that they serve a variety of beverages including grape, green apple, and watermelon Kool-Aid. The flavors will vary though.  The server was really nice, but she brought us all the wrong drinks.

The staff seemed overwhelmed and come to find out the wait to be seated also had to do with letting the kitchen catch up.   Oh well, overall it was ok, and like I mentioned the fried chicken is worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Have you been to Lo-Lo's yet? Oh my goodness don't wait another minute! The soul food is on point! The customer service is excellent and the servers make you feel like you're at home. We frequent this spot quite a bit, so much so, that the waitress already knows our drink order and entree. I changed it up on her last time, though, you should've seen the look on her face! Too funny! The menu has a variety of options so you'll never get bored! The fried catfish, collard greens, and of course the waffles, are my favorites! The people working there appear to like their job too. That goes a long way. Anytime my husband wants to go out and eat, we already know where! Maybe we'll see you next time!"}
{"text":"I was really excited for some good fried chicken, got the Shrimp and Grits instead, but ordered drumstick just to taste the fired chicken. I was very surprised the chicken was over cooked, chewy and no flavor after you got past the skin. The Shrimp and Grits was so overloaded with grease, my stomach is really not doing well. Service was 3rd rate no setups, and the food took forever. So sad, was excited to try it."}
{"text":"Oh no no no!!!!!! I don't know where it went wrong. Did the recipes not get passed across all of the locations. They aren't ANYTHING like Phoenix. The chicken was beyond DRY so we're the waffles. The macaroni was very watery not homemade at all. Tasted like $0.89 box of kraft Mac. Actually box kraft would of been better. Hey. One star for the decor!"}
{"text":"As I go to Scottsdale Az frequently, I also try and hit the Lo-Lo's everytime.  The Lo-Lo's there has always delivered in all areas (Service/Food Quality/Speed.  Unfortunately the Lo-Lo's (which I was looking so forward to having here in Vegas) has started out badly.  The service was friendly as well as new (thus the two stars). But the wait and the food left much to be desired.  The chicken was doughy on the outside as well as a little cold.  Mac and cheese was rubbery, corn bread crumbly and cold.  Rice and beans (which I love in Scottsdale) was watered down thus lacking flavor.  I know the restaurant has recently opened.  I will .... Try and make it back there in a month to see if they have improved enough to make me a regular.  I'm rooting for them HARD, but if it hasn't I will simply wait until my next trip to Arizona......."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. I don't know what happened but I used to love coming here. Food used to even taste better. This place has definitely fallen off the grid."}
{"text":"Second time is a charm. 

I was craving for chicken and waffles and stumbled upon Lo-lo's. I enjoyed their hospitality. I even got extra napkins and plates without asking the server (as i notmally do). I dined alone, so they were kind enough to put me in a less conspicuous seat. 

I knocked off a star as they should update the operating hours outside the door. I stopped by the night prior, very hungry but was turned away as they are closed.

Disclaimer: on my secons attempt, I had late lunch at 2pm so everything was delicious. But the serving size was huge, they let me take home and even offered sweet tea to go. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Heavens to Betsy! Nothing but love and scrumptiousness going on here!!! The food was so finger licking good, it's ridiculous! Everything we tried was off the hook! We had chicken, waffles, fried pickles, burger and fries. Kool-aid is made to sinful perfection!! An absolute must go to!! Yummy, won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been to LoLos a few times and didn't always have a good experience. When they opened the location in Gilbert I avoided it until the craving brought me back. I'm so glad I did. 

The food: it was cooked to perfection. Just the right amount of breading seasoned perfectly on juicy chicken. Nothing was cold. Nothing under or overcooked.

The service: it was super busy the Saturday we showed up but nothing was cold so that means we got decent service. Our waitress was super nice and could hold a conversation without awkwardness. She didn't have to write anything down for our group of 5 and we even had special requests. 

The atmosphere: my only complaint is they sat us right by the patio door and we got gusts of heat and wind every time the door opened. But the place was lively and everyone was having a good time."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! The portions are gigantic but the best part that's not on the menu is kool-aid! They have 5 flavors. Ask for Sarah, she's the best waitress!!!"}
{"text":"Despite reading the reviews on how terrible the customer service is, I still decided to come. Now that was a mistake...after walking in and waiting for a hostess to show up we finally were seated. No one came to our table for 20 mins to get our drink order or anything, so I had to find a waiter to see if anybody could take our order. A couple mins passed and a woman came to take our order. We only ordered water to drink and you wanna know how long that took ??? 15 mins. The food came about to 15 mins after that and the food was ok. I ordered the 2 wings and a waffle, the chicken was seasoned well and the waffles were nothing really special they didn't have any depth to them. Would I come back here probably not"}
{"text":"After long considering \"Chicken and Waffles\" a bizzaro mystery of the culinary world, I decided to finally give it a shot for lunch to see what the buzz was all about.  I arrived with a buddy a little after 11am and was welcomed right in by a gentleman holding the door and greeting us in.  The place is well decorated and another great addition to the ever growing DT Gilbert scene.  

We sat outside which I found very comfortable.  Soft booth like seating on one side against the wall and chairs on the other.  Umbrellas kept most of the sun away and the misters were on as well.  We were greeted immediately by our waiter who was energetic and outgoing.  He asked if we had been there before to which he received a mixed answer so he walked me through the menu layout and some of his recommendations.  Service remained excellent throughout the experience. 

As we moved onto our drink order I was slightly bummed to hear the selections were pretty limited.  Bud, Coors light, blah blah blah... then a Goose Island IPA, Fat Tire,  and a Kilt lifter.  Kilt lifter is a slam dunk for me but a little high on ABV @ 6% for lunch.  Already recognizing I would be slipping in a post lunch nap I went for it but they could certainly use some additional selections.  Drop one star for limited brews selection.  

The menu is massive and perhaps too much so.  You can certainly find something you like on it and I ordered a PHAT AZZ SAMICH with avocado and Chicken.  It arrived quickly and the food was pretty damn good.  It was a little on the dry side so I found myself slapping on a little mayo here and there.  The portions were HUGE and I could have split it for sure...but two guys just can't do that can they.     Another beer later I managed to get the whole thing down which I should not have done.  One again I proved I am a master of self - control.  :)

I see a lot of posts here about long waits and bad service.  I did not see any of that but I'm certain my timing had a lot to do with that.  People do also need to understand how hard it is to open a restaurant that gets slammed day 1 due to all of the excitement.  Finding great restaurant staff in AZ is not easy and they are a somewhat new place still rounding out the corners.  Additionally if you see a line out the door don't walk in expecting to get your shit right away... particularly in a new place.  I worked in \"the biz\" for over a decade and I give perhaps more grace than I should but it is a tough job and I truly believe that everyone should have to work as a waiter for at least a year to gain some context.  

As for the prices they were high which knocks them another star.  The beers were $7 for lunch which is nutz.  At that price I was waiting for a lap dance but the girl never came.  The sandwiches were $12 which was OK given the size but still a little high.  Lunch for two with two rounds of the 16oz beers came to $58.  After tip you are looking at a mid $30 per person lunch which is just too much to gain a lot of my business.   Hell I can do sushi for that.  

So Lo-Lo's,  grab some better and more expansive beers, drop the prices and portion size a bit, and polish up on the busy nights and I think you have a pretty damn good place there.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I don't write many reviews unless it was something absolutely wonderful or horrible that happen during my experience. I show my like or dislike of the service in the tip that I leave, but I will never leave less than 15%, because I know how much a bad tip can hurt your entire shift. 

We dined at this location on Mother's Day. We go to the other 2 locations on a regular basis. Being that it was a holiday, we automatically understood the wait time they quoted us of 30min. We did end up waiting 45 mins total, which again, was completely fine with us, because we did have a large party (5 adults, 2 kids, 1 toddler). 

Once seated, our server, nice and polite, took our drink order and  since we already knew what we wanted, he went back around the table and took the rest of our orders. I received my beverage from the bar about 10 mins later and the rest of my party received their beverages about 10 minutes after me. About 20-25 mins into waiting, the server did inform us that the kitchen was a bit behind, but they were trying their best to hurry with everyone's order. I appreciated that warning. 

As close to another 30 mins went passed, my grandmother called over the manager (who had been standing next to the bar for majority of our time seated, watching over the dining room) and asked her to see about how much longer our food would be. I saw her come out of the kitchen, visit 2 other tables and tend to her staff before my grandmother had to catch her walking past us and ask for that update she had asked for. She told us that our table was still about 6 tickets back. Definitely not what we wanted to hear but we stuck it out. (At this point, the sever comes and tells my grandmother that they are out of dressing and asks if she wants to substitute. This is relevant later) 

The food finally arrives and there were some minor problems. The sautéed spinach looking like someone had zapped it in the microwave, and not in the skillet. Someone in my party ordered their eggs-scrambled with cheese and onions INSIDE, as in, mixed into the egg. Both cheese and onions were on top of the eggs, onions were raw. And one of the children didn't receive his food at all. The food was dropped off by foodrunners, so once our server came by to check on everything, we let him know about the missing Oreo pancakes that were ordered. He comes right back and tells us they might be out of the batter for those pancakes, and the kitchen wants to know if he would like something small to eat in the meantime. We declined and his father gave him some food from his platter. Pancakes come out about 10 mins later, along with the sautéed spinach.  

15-20 mins into us enjoying our food, I look over in the direction of the bar area (we are seated right next to the bar and right next to the patio opening) and there is a kitchen employee, female, pants sagging with her apron on, on her cell phone, telling someone that they are out of cornmeal and trash bags. Not something any guest needs to hear. 

Things were running out slowly but surely. My grandfather ordered a Bud Light.. Out. Server told us next available was Miller... Out. Came  back and told us he had Miller Lite for sure...short glass was delivered. Now, to top everything off that has happened so far, we asked for ToGo containers with about half of everyone's food still on their plates.. Our server comes back and tells out they are out of to go boxes...!!!!!! What?! This can't be happening right now. There's no way that we waited all that time to get our food only to be, indirectly, told that we could not take it home with us! We asked him if he could get us foil, because there was NO WAY we were about to pay all that money for a half of a meal. We received foil and wrapped pancakes, Mac and Cheese, sautéed spinach and all in foil. The server also gave us bags. My grandmother, not pleased, asked to speak to the manager and after almost 15 mins of waiting, we couldn't take it anymore. We paid our bill and left. 

One thing I failed to mention is that every time our server came with some bad news, he did apologize and offer some type of substitution.  We understood that the happenings of the restaurant were not his fault, but of a very unprepared for holiday, that any manager, food service or not could tell a restaurant that they needed to order extra of everything, a week early! With so much negative word of mouth and reviews about this location, we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, and that was clearly the wrong thing to do. 

Not once did the manager apologize for anything that was happening, nor did she revisit the table before we left. I've been in the high volume food industry for 5 years now, and manager 2 of those years. I would have gotten my hind side chewed off if I did such a thing, by guests and my employer. Unfortunately, we could, physically, tell that we weren't the only family that had problems, as a father was yelling at the manager, outside."}
{"text":"We have been sitting here since 7:42p..it is now 9:06p and still no food..our waitress was not only the bar tender, but the cashier, and waitress..her name is shanieka..she was amazing and kept apologizing for the wait..not 1 time did a manager come and see us, but he did send his waitress to give us some buscuits..and our waitress/bartender/cashier bought us a beer...really like her..she was amazing and deserves a kudos.  May come back again..finally getting our food 9:15p...btw..rhe food is amazing"}
{"text":"I purposely timed everything because of all these reviews about wait times.
Easter morning breakfast for party of 4
Wait at 8am to get seated: none
Wait to be acknowledged (by buser): 9 mins
Wait for waitress to take out order: additional 6 mins from time of acknowledgment from the buser to get our drink order
Wait for food (1 breakfast sandwich,  1 omlette, 1 pancake): 42 mins
Food: 5/10
Price: Expensive ($5 for breakfast sandwich, 12 for omlette, $5 for ONE pancake)

Definitely not the place for us. Tables around us were left irritated and looking around for their food just as we were. The group to my right had to ask about their food and the group to my left said they were never coming back.

On your check, it rudely says at the bottom: \"the gratuity for your service today will be ___\" which I think is absolutely unnecessary."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 times and I'm kind of surprised at the bad reviews. I've had a great experience each time. I got just basic chicken and waffles and it was so good! Exactly what I expected if not better. I have been to Roscoe's in California and this place is way better than that in my opinion. I had attentive and friendly service each time. Drinks were made perfectly and when I wasn't drinking alcohol, I had the koolaid (it is so good!). It's pretty close to my house so I look forward to the next time I eat here."}
{"text":"I would give lolos a solid three and a half leaning towards a 4 for the food. Chicken tastes similar to Cane's with a little bit less peppery bite .  The waffle was cooked perfectly and went well with the chicken tenders. We went at lunch time and were seated right away and were tended to by our waitress well throughout the entire lunch...knowledgeable of the menu and suggested patron favorites.  The only glaring negative is that they only serve Pepsi products with no diet coke. And as we all know I am a diet coke snob. ;) I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing food! AMAZING service! Amazing drinks!!!
Faith, Charae, Roman and Cam were all awesome. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This location didn't exactly live up to the pictures on instagram, though the taste was delightful! Would eat here again, the kool aid on tap is the bomb."}
{"text":"While hanging out in Phoenix with Jon, he took us to Lo Lo's. We all had different versions of chicken and waffles. And they were yummy!
Got to sit outside, beautiful. 
Very clean and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Very rude. It took forever to get someone to help us when we first walked in the restaurant. Then when the hostess came and helped us, she put our name on the waitlist and said it would be 15 to 20 minutes until we could be seated. We then proceeded to wait half an hour for many other people were seated before us, even though it's not on the waitlist... we even watched a group of young kid sitting out on the patio and wait and wait and wait before anybody came and helped them. Everyone in there is very rude. There is no sense of urgency whatsoever at this location... we left before we were even seated....We will never be back."}
{"text":"Bomb!!! Their chicken tender salad is delicious and a nice big portion. I love always getting a side of mac n cheese and Arnold Palmer!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to LoLos this morning expecting a slightly longer wait time since it was a Sunday morning. We checked in at the front and they told us the wait would be 20-30 minutes. They also took our phone number and said that we would get a text when our table was ready. We went to wait outside because there was no room inside. Thirty minutes passes then forty then almost an hour with us waiting in the hot sun. I'm currently pregnant so I began to feel lightheaded and dizzy and went inside to check on how much longer we had. The hostess then stated that she gave my table away because we never came to get it. Mind you, I never received the text I was supposed to get saying that my table was ready. On a positive note, after explaining the situation with being pregnant, hungry, and dehydrated, she quickly cleared off a table and gave it to us. Our waitress quickly got us some water, which I drank very quickly from being dehydrated. It was only after I drank it all after finishing my food that I discovered a dead bug in the ice at the bottom of my cup, which made me vomit as soon as I got to the car, part of which was due to a weakened stomach due to pregnancy and part of which was due to the thought of what else may have been in my food. There were some positives to this visit, such as the food quality. The food came quickly, was appropriately heated, and tasted good. However, the poor organization, failure of their texting system, and bug in my water cup will really make me think twice about returning to this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"We just tried this place for the first time tonight with really low expectations, but,  were actually pleasantly surprised by service of our server Shaun for the most part, and the food was amazing to put the cherry on the top of the cake! Shaun was one of the best waiters I have literally Ever seen,  and we go out pretty much twice a week for the last 10 years. This guy I noticed was around the whole restaurant checking if everyone was ok.  Taking dirty dishes from tables that weren't his,  refilling drinks for the whole place, and Never once let our table's beverages get emptied. Really great employees at this location! The fact that he was a really gorgeous waiter was just a plus! 

Now to boast about the food.  I was honestly very skeptical at first not ever considering fried chicken and waffles together.  But I have to say that I might have found my new spot for grub on the Gilbert  side of town.  Shaun recommended that I try the \"You Mommas\" biscuit and gravy which Bar-None is the best biscuit and gravy meal I have ever eaten!  And I eat that a lot! My husband wanted to try the chicken and waffles,  and our friendly waiter suggested the Lolo meal and was kind enough to suggest adding strawberries and whip cream to the waffle which is my hubbies FAVORITE topping for only 3$ more.  So needless to say,  there is a gold mine of food waiting at this place and we will most definitely be returning soon.  And we will ask for Shaun if he is there,  but if not,  the whole staff was super friendly so it wouldn't matter who it is...  THANK YOU LOLOS for the great food and service! Glad to see downtown Gilbert is turning out so well!"}
{"text":"I have been twice now and I am a fan! I have to say the chicken and waffles was actually my least favorite thing we tried. It was good but nothing great, the waffles were eh. What was amazing is their biscuits and gravy. It is huge and really good. Just needs to be served a little warmer, both times they were barely luke warm! The oreo pancakes are amazing and are dessert and breakfast all in one! Service was great both occasions despite the restaurant being full. So glad we have this new location close to us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great. I went pretty late and there weren't that many people. The food came fast and was hot and tasty!"}
{"text":"I was beyond impressed! The hospitality, the customer service, the food! The server was so awesome; he even okayed peek -a-boo with my 3yr old. 
My daughter loved her waffle.  
The chicken was so flavorful! The seasoning was spot on,  the chicken moist. The waffles were crisp as airy. 
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful establishment! The employees here are all so friendly and really connect with their customers. This morning's visit was filled with joy. Our server, Kelvin, was helpful and always checking up on us to make sure that we had everything we needed and made sure we enjoyed what we had ordered. He got along with us very well and he interacted with us like we were all friends. I felt very welcomed and I can assure you that my friends did, too!  

Whoever is in charge of the hiring process is doing an amazing job. Every employee acknowledged our presence and gave us big smiles. I have never had such a great experience elsewhere. 

Not to mention, the food was delicious!

Excellent service. I will, without a doubt, be returning!"}

{"text":"My God!!!  Do not come here with a group of friends if you actually want to enjoy your meal AND chat.  Every time we put down our forks, \"Can we take your plate?\"  The chicken batter is tasty but the meat was dry.  Definitely needed the syrup to make it moist.  Pancakes were just the right thickness and not too doughy.  Nice and attentive staff but stop rushing people.  If I wanted to be done eating in 15 mins, I'd go to Micky D'S for Big Breakfast."}
{"text":"If you like southern comfort food, this is the place to go!  The best sweet tea, ever!  It's served in a large mason jar and is definitely something to try!  They also serve kook aid in several different flavors, also in large mason jars!  They have a full bar and serve waffles and pancakes all day as well as dinner items and appetizers!

The portions are large, but the prices are good.  We had the soul food choices, which feature several different options that come with two sides and the best, corn bread muffins!  My husband had two fried catfish fillets with Cole slaw and fried okra.  I had chicken fried chicken, which was a huge boneless chicken fillet, smothered in white, sausage gravy, sautéed zucchini and yellow squash and the best macaroni and cheese that I ever had and a large, sweet and tasty, corn bread muffin!  The price for all of those items were just $15.00!  You can't beat that price!  I had to take half of my dinner home to eat later.  There is many sides that you can add to your dinner for a minimal price.  We got a fluffy, home made biscuit, smothered in white, sausage gravy.  So good!  There is also some yummy looking desert options, but I'm always too full to try them!

The reason that I only gave them 4 stars is because the tables and chairs are not very comfortable and a tad low for me.  I also agree with other reviews that the service could be better.  It's not that it's bad service, but a bit slow and our waiter kept forgetting things.  All in all, though, it is well worth a visit!   We love going there!  The managers always come around and ask how your dinner is and the staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles is best known for being the Roscoe's of the Phoenix area but like everyone else they just had to get a piece of Vegas.  I have been here twice on different occassions.  During peak hours and the weekends, this place can get quite busy.  The best part about this Vegas location is that there is lots of parking even though it is a drive from both DTLV and the Strip.  My first time around I came to spend time with my cousins at the bar.  I ordered the Georgia On My Mind, which was suprisingly good.  As far as my second time around, I had to give Lo Lo's another try before leaving.  I ordered the Lo Lo's (# 3 on the menu) which was 3 pcs of chicken and 2 waffles.  The chicken was nice and juicy and not too bready.  The waffles had a hint of cinnamon yet were thick and delicious.  As far as I know, Roscoe's wins the battle of the waffle, but Lo Lo's wins on variety because there is EVERYTHING FOR EVERYBODY.  Also unlike Roscoe's, Lo Lo's serves alcoholic drinks and serves most of their drinks in Mason jars.  The service was great and exceeded my expectations.  For those who LOVE Roscoe's you will have mixed feelings about Lo Lo's.  For those who had Lo Lo's in Phoenix, you would expect the same great food and service at the Las Vegas location."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, service isn't great. We go in hungry and despite long wait times (waiting: to be seated, order to be taken, drinks to make it to the table, food to make it to the table, check to be presented/taken back) we leave full and satisfied. 

I used to think it was because they are understaffed but after seeing more employees working at one time, I think it may be more of a management of staff issue - assign employees specific roles but train them on how to help others when needed."}
{"text":"Service was really slow but waitress was nice and helpful. Loved the mason jars for our drinks, however, they do \"sweat\" all over the table making a wet mess. 

Our party of six was really looking forward to the chicken and waffles.  This was our first time here, and figured we can't go wrong with the signature dish. The waffles were ok, a bit heavy with cinnamon flavor.  But the fried chicken seriously had NO flavor, none!  No salt or Pepper?  We could not understand how this restaurant could serve such bland chicken.  Unfortunately, we just didn't enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but the service was barely acceptable. We were a party of 3, arrived around 8:30pm and it took over an hour for our food to come out. During that time our waitress did not volunteer any explanation for the delay and only apologized once we asked about the hold up. Turns out they had a large party of ~100 people who placed orders shortly before we did. They should have let us know this would cause a delay in getting our food out...

She did give us some complementary biscuits while we waited. Once the food arrived, there were a couple things wrong with our order but by that time we had waited so long we gave up complaining. The food was average, about what I expected. 

We did ask for 20% off our meal due to the excessive wait and the manager obliged - I will give them that credit. Although, I wished the manager and sever would have been proactive about their faults in timely customer service! 

Management please take note and please do better."}
{"text":"We had a good Sunday dinner. Our waitress (Ms. LaDonna) was very attentive despite being overwhelmed with a large party at her section. I think she handled the situation very well. The staff and management take pride in their work. I witnessed Them come together to quickly clean up a table full of plates, wipe down the table and sweep up the floor for a party of 10 in less than 5 minutes and arrange three tables to meet the needs of the party. They are very energetic and bring positive feelings to the customers. I can't imagine a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Amazing food, Windy was a fantastic server. Come early, it's so good they can run out of things, but everything is so good it doesn't matter! Will be back often!"}
{"text":"I do have to say, I was worried about the reviews of the Gilbert location. I've been to the downtown one numerous times and have never had an issue. I went to the Gilbert location tonight and was very happy with it. I'm glad I didn't fight the i17 traffic to go downtown. The food was good (for the most part), but the service was some of the best service I've received at any restaurant!! Justin was awesome! He was happy to serve us, always smiling, and really a joy to be around! 
Don't be afraid of the other reviews. This place did a great"}
{"text":"My review is only on the service and blackened catfish dinner. We had a party of 7 and The staff was fast and friendly. The catfish was tasty and not overlooked. Next time I will try the chicken the next time!"}
{"text":"After having relocated from the South, and craving southern food, I really wanted this place to work out!  However, I just gagged when I ate there.  The collards had clumps of spinach mixed into them (spinach!), the fried okra tasted frozen, and the cheesy grits - my beloved cheesy grits - were unsalted and just had a sprinkling of melted cheese on top of them!  Not mixed in, no flavor!  The sweet tea is too, too sweet, and there's no sweet potato pie!  What kind of southern food restaurant does that?  Overall, the meal was tasteless and the service slow.  C'mon, Lo-Lo's, up your game!  Hate to see you having to close shop."}
{"text":"Omfg this place is amazing the food is awesome it is very tasty delivered on time nice and hot it was our first time there and they knew it so we had 3 different people attending to our needs the service was great and the food was amazing will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I'm from California I worked at every Chicken and Waffles in Los Angeles California the food was ok but ill never go there again. I got one waffle, three pieces of bacon, fried green tomatoes and koolaid and paid $42.00. Never again. Way to high I wanted to walkout but I'm visiting and don't want to go to jail out of state."}
{"text":"I think we all need to give LoLo's a bit of a break.  It's only been a couple of weeks since they opened. All new place,  all new employees in a high volume area. 

My family and I love the Scottsdale location so despite the reviews we decided to check it out. Aside from a few glitches with the hostess staff, it was a really wonderful experience. The location is great, it's really nice inside,  very comfortable,  super terrific service and the food was AMAZING!  

Bottom line: you may have a few hiccups, so bring a tiny bit of patience. It's worth it and you can tell they are really trying! I would highly recommend this place it was a good experience!  :)"}
{"text":"I advise everyone to try the apple green koolaid! Yummy place for great a price, take a while to get the food once ordered but with it when it finally makes the table. Customer service is not too friendly but hey, food is totally worth it !"}
{"text":"If you plan to eat here make sure your phone battery is fully charged.you will need it to pass the time for every aspect of your dining experience. I have tried this place several times and the last was the worst. It always has taken the staff a long time to greet you, the food wait is the longest. Expect at least 35 to 45 min for food to arrive. Drink that first drink very slow, it took my refill 20 minutes after the server forgot it. My wife asked to talk to the manager, which took him 25 minutes to talk to us. As all this was going on, not once did our server say sorry for the wait. I worked in the food service industry for 16 years, I know that there is no reason that the place did not know how long ticket times are. It felt like every employee in the place did not care what was got g on around them. The place was not busy and maybe at 25 percent capacity when we ate there. Me and my h wife have never said we will not go back to any place, until now."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a pleasant experience.  Our waitress was Kiera and she was very attentive and was constantly checking on us! The food was really good I recommend the fried green tomatoes."}
{"text":"Came here for Easter brunch! Even though they don't take reservations, we only waited a max 10 mins to be seated. For a holiday, that's great and it wasn't overly packed. I ordered LoLo's entrée and the others ordered pancake entrées. I must say, ALL of our food was DELICIOUS AND FULL OF FLAVOR! The drinks are refillable and they provide a prefect portion of food. 

-Flaws: it took longer than expected for our food to arrive BUT it was hot and fresh when we got it. Also, our food didn't come together. They brought things one by one which was weird, but I don't believe that's their norm, probably some miscommunication in the kitchen on a holiday. We had everything within 5 minutes, but it would've been better if it all came together. 
-Don't order sides, just stick with the meal you order.  A side of any meat is an extra $4. Too expensive for something bland and basic. This includes a side of eggs, not with it! 
Other than that. ......
I WILL DEFINITELY BE RETURNING!!!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I sat there for over 15 minutes trying to get a waiters attention and no one ever even came over to even take our drink order. We got up and left because we were so hungry and didn't know if we'd ever get served"}
{"text":"Food was ah-mazing!! I got the 2 drumsticks and waffle. Chicken was crisp yet juicy which is hard to find these days. Being the southerner I am of course I ordered sweet tea, was a little too sweet for my taste, but food/drink wise that's my only complaint. As far as the restaurant itself the music was SUPER loud could even hear the people I was there with."}
{"text":"Star was are waitress and she did an amazing job. The food was tasty and the place was clean. Recommend the Lo Lo and the French toast."}
{"text":"Worse serves ever my waiter was rude no service!!! First we get seated then after he doesn't ask us do we need anything to drink we had to hunt him down to ask him can we order then we order he brings us waffles with no syrup!!!!! Waffles cold my chicken hard never again first time I ever been here want be back!!!!"}
{"text":"They have the window open by the bar. It's so hot inside that it's unbearable to enjoy the dining experience. We waited for thirty minutes for a table and have been seated and waiting for our dinner for an hour. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious! The chicken is tender and juicy. Love the waffles and the French toast! We sat at the bar and our bar tender was Awesome! The service and food is excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing,amazing. Visiting my brother in Vegas, he took me to this place. Now there's a lot of places that claim to have soul food but only a few have real soul food...this is that place. The staff was friendly and our food was amazing. The Mac & cheese were to die for and the collard greens were well seasoned. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy inside. If you want really great soul food at a good price, this will be your new favorite spot."}
{"text":"All of my food was old and nasty! Server never came to check on us. Had to ask someone else's server and she didn't even bring me what I asked for. Horrible experience, and I loved lolos in phoenix. This location is a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"I visited this location in April for my birthday weekend and feel in love. They were welcoming and service was great. Our waiter kept checking in on us to make sure we were okay & to see if we needed anything etc. The food was AMAZING the menu was definitely ghetto, but I was to busy laughing to actually get offended. We waited no longer then 10-15 minutes for our food. Definitely will return when ever I go back to Vegas"}
{"text":"I know the reviews say the service is bad but I'll say this.... If you get a chance to sit in the bar section, Elizabeth will give you the best service possible. Not only was she friendly, she made you feel like you were at home. I really appreciate her service. And the food was amazing"}
{"text":"This is my first experience at Lo-Lo's and I won't be  coming back.  I ordered the Oreo pancakes and looked forward to the cream cheese frosting.  We also got the Aunt Portia's omelet and another order of Oreo pancakes.  The restaurant wasn't busy and yet it took a half hour for our food to arrive.  While it looked delicious, it was deceiving.  The omelet was way overdone and the chicken in it was incredibly dry.  My pancakes were burnt and too dry to eat.  The cream cheese frosting tasted more like sour cream so I couldn't even use that to mask the taste of burnt pancakes.  The bill came and for 3 drinks ($3.50 a piece for soda!!), two orders of burnt pancakes and a dry over cooked omelet it was over $50!  At that point I had to ask for the manager and he took $20 off our bill.  Yeah, that didn't cut it for a horrible dining experience."}
{"text":"We were in the area last week and wanted to see what LoLo's dessert would be like that day.  We chose the perfect time of day it seems. That afternoon we were pleased to be seated quickly and our server Stacey, was on it and knew her stuff.. Aware and attentive an understatement. 
    We think, well we know we ate more than we came in for. The suggested \"Stupid Fries\" were stooooopid good. The Kool Aid never misses and the red velvet cake, I'll make sure I get ice cold milk next time to go with it. 
    We Will also ask for Stacey whenever we come, You don't forget people like her, she was awesome."}
{"text":"I fail to understand why this place only has an overall 3-star rating.  My group and I met here on a Friday morning for our monthly management meeting.  I ordered their chicken and waffles.  Our drink orders were promptly taken.  Their sweet tea is delicious.  I opted for their chicken and waffles.  The chicken was moist and the skin was crispy and mouth watering.  The waffle was OK...the the best, but certainly not the worst.  Service was attentive and friendly.  If I ever find myself on this side of town, you can bet I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Good was good, service was good. Arrived at 9am for breakfast (that's when they open for breakfast) and ordered biscuits and gravy. \"Oh, sorry biscuits are going to be a while\"  if you don't open until 9 for breakfast...everything should be prepped. Kitchen gets a D-. If you go, be flexible, they may not have gotten around to preparing all the menu items. The chicken & waffles are really good. The first time I was there (again for breakfast at 9) the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Wow, what can I say other than this has to be the worst experience I/we have ever had.  Lolo's 
Gilbert gets one star because the waffle tasted deceit and the server was polite.  This place is tiny inside and no room to even go to the bathroom without bumping into other chairs or people.  Sound system is terrible only heard annoying bass, bass, bass, no mid/treble or vocal.  We(party of 7 adults, 1 child, 1 infant) arrived at 11:51 am with no one in the waiting area. Only one of us had ever eaten at Lolo's before, but only at the other locations.  We were sat at 12:02 and asked for waters all the way around, with three sodas.  We received our drinks at 12:19 pm and ordered at that time.  Pretty simple order, a appetizer(sliders) to start,  two # 3, one # 5, 2 orders of chicken fingers, 1 side of macaroni cheese, 1 breast side and 1 leg side.  Twenty minutes later I noticed that several tables around us had been waiting a long time for their food.  One table next to us finally received their food  30 minutes after we had sat down and their order was missing the child's food, which took an extra 8 minutes to get.  At this point I knew there was going to be a problem with service.  Fourteen minutes later, now sitting for 44 minutes, I had made eye contact with our server and mentioned that it has been 45 minutes, where is our food.  Five minutes later 3 adults and 1 child were served and it went down hill from there.  Five minutes later 1 more child was served and at that point the server didn't know that we had never received our appetizer or the others in our party had not received their food.  Two separate breast and the chicken fingers were dry and very tough to chew.  Macaroni and cheese was just warm as well as the sliders but dry also.  The family had to share their food until all of the order was placed on the table, which by that point was only a mood point because we were all full from water.  In between all this we expressed our major disappointment as well as frustration for the service and quality.  A different server was expediting the order for our server and she had mentioned about a free desert for our trouble which was ridiculous.  We never received a water refill and we couldn't get our server to come back over for anything, I had to grab an extra silverware serving as well as napkins from the end of the bar.  I also had to walk to the other side of the dining area to ask our server for syrup.  We asked different servers several times for a manager as well as asking other servers for our check but no manager nor check.  One of the servers told us that the manager was cooking and couldn't come out.  After 15 minutes of waiting  we all decided to walk.  We all got up and started walking out  and I over heard one of the other servers screaming across the dining room, \"they didn't pay I going to call the cops\".  This loud and rude server followed us out side and started to walk after us while calling the police.  Never asking if we paid or if she could help us out.  She left her tables and was outside walking after us. We tried to talk to her but she would not talk to us and so we waited for the police.  The police arrived, after which point my son had already paid the bill because he was so embarrassed about her screaming at us with 100 people present.  We spoke to the police officer and he wanted to make sure we paid.  My two sons went inside with the police officer to talk to the manager, and the manager made the officer wait 12 minutes before he spoke with them.  The officer could not believe it.  The police officer was so cool and understood why we were so frustrated in the first place.  After finding out my son paid the whole bill the officer convinced the manager to charge us 50 percent of the bill, which was too much, but whatever.  We didn't even finish the meal, over half of it was not eaten.  I will never go to another Lolo's ever and I will continue to tarnish their image with ever source available to mankind, by telling this horrendous story.  The server that called the police said that everyone waits 45 minutes to be served, not me.  Especially for sub pare food and incomplete orders.  If your going to make the guest wait 45, it better be perfect!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time @ Lo Lo's with the fam and it was great!  Decided to stop and check Lo Lo's out for a Saturday breakfast.  We got seated and our server Bre was fabulous! She recommended the look-aid for the kids & the Mimosa's for us adults... delicious!  We ordered our food and wow we got our food in no time! 

Food: Food was delicious! Chicken & Waffles, biscuits & gravy, pancakes w/ caramel, bananas & pecans, & french toast. The chicken looked alittle over cooked but was still good. The was also abundant! We could've share two of the plates and still be full! 

Service: WOW ... talk about being attentive! We really enjoyed their friendly customer service! Bre was our main waitress but all the other waiters/waitress' came by to see how we were doing & if we needed anything! They even made an impression on my kids.... and my kids appreciated their friendliness & service! 

Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The Double D is one of my favorite meals ever!! Try to go every other month as I am trying to lose weight and eat better but I refuse to give this up!!! My daughter loves the food here and we are both fans of the hot sauce--buy bottles for the house....."}
{"text":"Nykeia was our server and she was awesome! I have never eaten chicken and waffles before so I decided to stop in and give it a try. Nykeia was very helpful and recommended popular dishes and also recommended what she likes to eat. I decided to go with what she likes and I'm glad I did. Food was great and the service she provided was excellent.

I will be back and hopefully Nykeia will be our server again."}
{"text":"Ooh la la, Lo-Lo's Chicken is da best in the west! Actually, this restaurant is located in The Best of the West shopping center, near McDonald's.

Been wanting to try it, but place is pretty busy on weekends. So, we checked it out for an early lunch on Friday and got right in.  There were waves of patrons in and out of the lower dining area, but the bar area with the pub tables seem to have availability so we'll keep that in mind, too.  Nice open feel to the building, wood-look floors, red leather booths, and vintage touches with bold art pieces. 

Our server Chevy was friendly and happy to answer our many questions.  We decided to be initiated with the standards--chicken and waffles, with sides of dirty rice and gravy with onions, washed down with unsweetened southern tea and half&half tea.  BF and I both loved the hot chicken, well seasoned and crunchy fried exterior, tender juicy meat.   Super large chicken pieces, too.  (Note to smaller appetites, go with the Lil Amadi or risk lugging around a doggy bag after lunch.)  We both had never tried chicken and waffles before and didn't quite understand the fuss, but we do now!  Buttered, soft waffles with maple syrup make the perfect base for a piece of crispy chicken. A fork full of a delish, unexpected combination.   Oh, why did we wait so long to discover this? Now we have to make up for lost time.

The dirty rice is made with gizzards, so if you're used to Popeye's dirty rice, you'll be put off.  It's a bit on the dry side, so be warned.  The gravy is the red gravy and was topped with a few slices of nearly raw onions, not my favorite.

Just glad they did the chicken and waffles well!  Planning to try other selections next time as the menu was fairly extensive.  I know it's a chain restaurant,  but it celt.loke a local diner.  Glad it's in Vegas."}
{"text":"I wish I could tell you how great the food was but I never got to order. I scored a parking space right out front and when I walked in I barely had to wait to be seated, so I thought things were going well. 
I sat down and read the menu for about 5 minutes, didn't get a hello or water or a be right with you. So I just kept sitting. I closed my menu and looked around a bit and no one made any kind of contact. Finally, I got my book out and read 2 chapters before I finally gave up and walked out."}
{"text":"The shrimp macaroni and cheese is the bomb! It's oh so filling. Customer service is good. Food came out fast. The place has a full bar. My new go to spot when I'm in town. Did I mention the full bar? Let us not forget about the eye candy that rolls into this place."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Tuesday evening to meet family visiting from Cali and the restaurant was literally empty. The waitress came to the table with no greeting or a smile. The food came and the chicken was okay , my family had fish and said that was good however I came here last year and I do remember the food was great! Not the case now. There was too much salt in the gravy and the potatoes.. The waitress was not attentive at all. She never checked on us and I had to stand up and wave to get her attention for some water. There were only 3 tables with customers. She came to bring the bill but never asked if we wanted dessert and by that time I had enough.  I was very disappointed and really was hoping this place was gonna be better especially after being shut down. I live on the other side of town but needless to say I'm never coming back. They lost what could have been a loyal customer especially since we have visitors all the time. Oh and this waitress was super flirty with our husbands but clearly didn't want to wait on us."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Cali and our thing was Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles..... If LoLo's came to Cali, Roscoe's would be done! I loooooove this place! Large portions of that down home southern cooking you only get on special occasions. Paired with a large mason jar full of hella sweet Koolaid that makes your ears pop. 

I love the family pictures on the walls, and the old school 90's R&B playing. Just a great atmosphere! 

Only cons I have about LoLo's is the wait, the smart ass duo who work the front, and the need to ask for the chicken to come out of the fryer a little earlier. Other than that, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere, great wait staff. The open concept makes it a little loud, but it's not overbearing. (Every now and again you can hear the three year old from the table over from you singing her abc's and the table full of the Gilbert wives club complaining about certain stages of menopause, but that's probably why they put TVs in the center...so guys will have something to focus on ). Nice place. Good food."}
{"text":"Here's the deal to having an ideal experience @ the LoLo's in Gilbert,especially on Sunday. Go early,before 9 a.m.,sit @ the bar,& have Nick take care of you! I've been in the restaurant biz for a loooong time & Nick is a true professional! He knows his way around the menu & he will hook you up w/good food & GREAT service"}
{"text":"The food was amazing the service great Very attentive and friendly staff anybody who doesn't try it is missing out"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with my mom and my sister. Kevin was our server and he definitely provides great customer service! Glad he moved down to this location! 
We ordered two phat azz sandwiches and a number three which includes three pieces of chicken and two waffles. Oh and had the yummy sweet tea and the tropical punch kool aid  (for some ppl both can be a little too sweet so I always ask for a glass of water to water it down a tad bit) I also got a side of the mac and cheese. (Extra charge) The food tasted great and the ambiance was welcoming. Def coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is fantastic.  I got the Puff's tender basket with a waffle. The chicken was cooked perfectly, crunchy on the outside, hot and juicy inside. The waffles are thin and made with cinnamon so every bite was delicious."}
{"text":"Aight ya'll if you haven't been here you are genuinely missing out. Between the amazing menu and the customer service and affordable prices it will make you question why you'd go anywhere else. Our waitress was Windy, and she was on point, she was patient, and knowledgeable about the menu, and so nice. Both my sister and I opted for the lil c with red beans and rice and 2 pieces of chicken, we also had an appetizer of fried green beans, then for dessert I had banana pudding and my sis had peach cobbler. I'm telling you, this place does not disappoint. Come to Lolo's, I promise you, you'll be back again and again. I live in silverado ranch, believe me the drive is worth it!!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Lo-Lo's for years. I used to eat at the original location in Phoenix. That is THE best! I had also been to the Scottsdale location a couple of times before they moved. It was also very good.

We went to the Gilbert location on Thursday, 5-31, before seeing a play at Hale Theatre. The host greeted us with a smile and was very friendly, but he sat us right beside the kitchen. Bleh! Three steps and I could have been in there. The restaurant was almost empty. My fault for not asking for a better table; but still, the kitchen seats should be the last place to take customers, when nothing else is available.

The reason for 3 stars instead of what should be 4 to 5 is it felt dirty in there. The table next to us was dirty. We had to brush crumbs off our seats. The floor had food on it and the mirror on the wall had handprints all over it. When a restaurant is slow, there's no excuse for the place not to be spotless! I've worked in a restaurant and I've worked retail. When we weren't busy, we were cleaning. No standing around, chitchatting. 

Our waiter was friendly and brought our drinks right away, but when we said we needed a couple of minutes to decide, it seemed like he gave us a good 20 mins. Hello? Where'd you go? When he did appear again and took our order, the food came out pretty fast, so that was nice. He did check on us a couple of times, as did another waitress. All the staff seemed outgoing and happy to be there.

I had the chicken breast and a waffle with pecans. It was very hot and delicious. Lo-Lo's is the only place that serves nice, big pieces of chicken. Anywhere else you order chicken and waffles, you get those nasty chicken tender things. My dad had three pieces of chicken and two waffles. It was a lot of food; even he couldn't finish it all! He seemed to really enjoy it, though.

As we left, the host again was very gracious. 

With so many restaurants around, I'm sad to say I'm not sure this LoLo's will be near the top of my list for choices. Maybe if you really work on cleanliness, I'll be back again one of these days..."}
{"text":"The food was excellent the service was very slow. But the atmosphere of a family owned restaurant was there and it left a happy feeling to a full stomach. The griddle was broken but that didn't stop them from producing some outstanding food."}
{"text":"The BEST Chicken and Waffles!
Amazing service. 

I forgot my new hand bag and they saved it. 

Thank you so much! I will be back, with more friends."}
{"text":"I arrived day 2 off their opening. Like most restaurants opening I expected poor service and a long wait for my food. I found this restaurant to be quite the opposite!
Not only was I greeted at the door by 4 young lady's with beautiful smiles but my waiter, Misty,  was da best! When Misty was busy waiting on other tables her supporting staff consistently checked on me. Oh, did I mention da food?  Awesome!!! My order arrive hot & fast.
Service, Atmosphere, Food & Music. Lo Lo's makes you forget about that other Los Angeles franchise, Roscoe's... (Who Dat???)
This place makes you want to go Old School, OFF DA CHAIN!!!!
Lo Lo's Chicken & Waffles - Welcome to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast Sunday morning.  The breakfast selections are priced at around 12 to 15 dollars, however lurking amidst these selections is a five dollar special from 7 to 11am only.  Great price for two eggs, three strips of bacon, grits and a home made biscuit or toast.  I added an order of home fries that were a lot like potatoes O'brian and were really good.

Water served with a lemon slice in a mason glass.  Good coffee too.

Service was fast and professional.  

The only downside for me was the ample use of butter and that might be a plus for you.  The grits had a huge scoop of butter. The toast was absolutely drenched in butter.  My advice would be to ask for all butter on the side if you don't have your cardiologist on speed dial.  None of this stuff will ever pass for healthy food, but it tasted good."}
{"text":"The food is somehow not equal to the other locations I've been to and yet the service is even worse. They've had issues with wait staff not being on top of food and checks for as long as I can remember. The fact that you can eat at 15 superior restaurants, all with attentive staff and much better food, within walking distance,  means I will never go back."}
{"text":"Love Lo-Lo's! It's such a fun and funky place to eat. Our kids always have such a blast giggling at the menu names and ordering different color Kool-Aids. We originally tried the location in Arizona while on vacation and loved it so when we saw there was one here in Vegas we had to check it out. We always have great service every time we go, the servers are always friendly and upbeat. The food is always delicious. My favorite is the Stupid Fries! They are absolutely to die for. Whatever sauce they use as gravy is SO good! Now don't get me wrong, this definitely isn't our nightly or even weekly dinner spot, we'd probably be battling high cholesterol and obesity if we did but it's definitely a treat every once in a while. I highly recommend this place, maybe as your \"cheat\" day spot."}
{"text":"good food here but don't expect fast service 
i come here whenever i crave chicken & waffles but the last few times the service has always been slow 
definitely the only negative feedback i have to give"}
{"text":"The decor is laid back and has a relaxed casual feel.  With a combination of tables and booths there is plenty of seating.  The lemonade had a slightly salty hint to it but ever so light which made me wonder what ingredients they used in it but I still liked it.
The chicken breast and wing were tasty, loved it.  Next time I go though I will peel the skin as my mostly non fry diet can't do it anymore but damn if it's not tasty.  Waffles are bringing me back, they were great too!  Lolo's is a great hang anytime of the week, it's a must go in old town Gilbert.  Man, I just wrote myself into hungry.  Go check em out, it's worth it."}
{"text":"This was my third time at this Lo-Lo's, and was still unimpressed by their food. I think it's just way too overhyped. I ordered some basic food, which was some chicken tenders. Got my food and it was basically dried up left over chicken that they wanted to get rid of. The waitress we had noticed how weird it looked as well. She came back with an actual chicken tender. I asked her why the one she gave me was different than the one I had originally been served. She questioned it herself as well, and was so kind to give me an actual plate of chicken tenders. I don't really know what all the hype is about with this place."}
{"text":"Their customer service is some shit.. we waited 15-20 minutes to get served and called 3 people over to serve us and it wasn't even busy.. that's crazy.. if I could give it a 0 I would... and that's me being nice.. terrible terrible customer service.."}
{"text":"I am not a picky person. So much so that I have never written a review on any food place for bad service. This will be my first. 

I don't really need to go into detail. We have Ben to LoLo's so many times at other location and never once had a problem.  So when one was built less than 5 miles from our home we were so happy. 

The hour wait to get a table was expected. No complaints there.  Once we sat down we were greeted in less than a minute. To take our drink order. The following is a capture of our waitress interaction from arrival (time between each interaction with the server) 

1 min 
Drink order   
15 min 
Food order 
45 min 
food arrives 
30 min
Check dropped of
15 min 
Check picked up
10 min 
Receipt returned. 

If you are adding that up. We were there for a grand total of almost 2 hours. If you notice not one time were our drinks refilled. Not one time were we asked if we needed anything. The food was not dropped of by the waitress so really once she took our order we didn't see her again for over an hour.  

Now I'm no genius. But it sounds to me like this type of service may be directly correlated to the long wait times everyone seems to be so upset with. 

I want to be very clear.  I love LoLo's. The food and service at every other location I have ever been to has been of the highest quality. But I can promise you. I'd rather make the 40 min commute to Scottsdale than to ever step foot in this location again."}
{"text":"A valley classic....yes get the chicken and waffles. And having not had kook-aid since I was a kid, this was a nice change of pace.  Also if you are looking for a place in to eat breakfast in south Scottsdale, this place has better food and is some how not as busy as the trendier places in the area."}
{"text":"Waited two hours for my food - a side salad, a side of red beans and rice and a side of fried okra. I understand the Saturday rush, but when a party of 8 is seated after you and receives their food before you...unacceptable. 

Beans and rice has eggs and also has a sweet bbq taste that I'm not a fan of, okra has no taste, catfish has no taste. Salad was wilted, asked the waitress to return it...she left it on my bill anyway. 

Over it."}
{"text":"Awesome service while being super friendly!  The food was great! We had the fried green beans that were great and the waffles and chicken were great! Fun place to have a carefree lunch."}
{"text":"Slow Horrible Service with a big heaping side of Attitude!!!  Deserved zero stars, but that wasn't an option.  Consider yourself warned.  OK...here's the details.  Arrived at 1:00 to eat lunch on our way to drop daughter off at airport.  We had an hour so we thought plenty of time.  We got seated at 1:05.  We waited and waited and waited.  Lo-Lo's was about 1/3 full...so not too crowed and there seemed to be plenty of staff walking around.  No less than 3 different waitress passed by our table with none making eye contact.  OK 15 minutes and I waived one down.  She said I'm not your server, but will let them know.  I went and told the manager...ok...3 minutes later a server came by and said \"I'm not your server, but will take your drink order.\"  OK....We waited...waived down the same server and we said we are ready to order.  She took our order....and we waited and waited...you get the idea.  OK 45 minutes after arriving I waived down a server for a refill and asked for the manager.  He brought our food...I explained this is ridiculous he apologized and gave one meal free.  Now for the kicker.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and was brought a catfish sandwich.  My daughter ordered COOL BRE BRE'S CHICKEN SALAD, but when it was delivered it had no candied walnuts, no cherry tomatoes, no avocado, or no applewood bacon.  All of which is in the picture and the description."}
{"text":"Nice place for sure. Food and service was decent. But that fried chicken was bomb. Took about 45 mins to get our food."}
{"text":"I went here probably during their soft opening and I was amazed!
Their catfish was out of this world. The chicken was so juicy and tender, but the waffle was nothing impressive, it was limp and small. How are you going to have on facet of the meal amazing and the other lacking? The Koolaide was overpoweringly sweet so I ordered a glass of water. The wait staff that night were awesome and food didn't take to long, but after reading all these 1-3 star reviews I'm not sure if I want to return.
The fact that the owner/manager hasn't tried to make right (on yelp) of the negative reviews isn't very reassuring either."}
{"text":"So I was really excited when I first saw this sign going up and they were building this because I am originally from California and I am a super huge fan of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles so my fiance came and picked me up from work for lunch one day and he was like let's try this place can't go wrong with chicken and waffles. I was wrong it was not it was definitely not Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles the sides were very Bland and had no taste the chicken were big pieces which I was surprised about,the waffle was just okay it wasn't something to write home about the service did take forever but the server was super nice.The prices were a lot compared to other places I have been to.."}
{"text":"We walked in and it was kinda busy. The people in front of us asked how long the wait was and they said an hour. I was excited because I have never had chicken and waffles before and I heard good things about this place. I had been looking forward to eating here for weeks. We asked to be placed on the list. One hostess stated that there was no guarantee that we would get a table. I asked if they closed at 11 or noon and that was why. She said no, they closed at 6 pm. The other two girls at the hostess stand just kind of stared. So I stated, we would be happy to wait an hour and she repeated that there was no guarantee. So I asked if they had a waiting list that we could be put on and she reluctantly pulled out a tablet. I asked if it was a list like we would get a text when our table was ready and she said once again that there was no guarantee. Our friend put her name/number on the list. We decided to walk around to wait and my friend got a text to download an app to see when our table was ready. This was very inconvenient and told us that there were no parties waiting in front of us. This was within minutes of us making the reservation, so we knew that couldn't be true. When we walked back, there were 7 tables open out on the patio. We were so frustrated with the unprofessional/unwelcoming service and app that we ended up driving off to Chandler to eat elsewhere. Then we got a text within minutes of getting back in the car saying that our table was ready. All of this was within the course of 20 minutes, so it wasn't really an hour wait, and the rudeness wasn't warranted. I have no idea why a restaurant would want to turn away customers, but they got two groups to turn around and leave while we were there. I plan on either trying another location or a different restaurant that serves chicken and waffles... we were trying to go to the Gilbert location."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from this place about a week ago. It was the most disgusting soul food I've ever had in my life. I went to Lolo's before to dine-in and the food was prepared well. But I guess for takeout, they don't really care. I kid you not....my waffles were MICROWAVED! Well at least they seemed to have been microwaved. They were completely soggy and soft. Also, my cornbread had the consistency and taste of $1.99 cornbread from Walmart. The Mac and cheese tasted like I got it from an elementary school cafeteria. What a COMPLETE waste of money. The best soul food is in other cities. Arizona has no business in this type of food. I was actually so appalled at how bad the food was that I had to immediately tell everyone I knew. Complete trash food!!"}
{"text":"I had heard some unfavorable reviews from family members but I thought this place was more than satisfactory.  Maybe not 4 stars, but probably 3 1/2.  The waffles weren't crispy but the chicken certainly was.  The mac n cheese acceptable and the fried green beans were fantastic.  The place was freezing though.  My husband had to get a coat out if the car.  The dish names were over the top.  I ate \"Betty's boob\".  Oh, and they make a killer Arnold Palmer.  I would come back... Eventually."}
{"text":"Okay before I start you have to know that I never complain about anything, I am actually a pretty easy going person, but today's trip to lo-lo was disappointing. I went with my mom and my kiddos for lunch. It took what seemed like forever to get anyone to acknowledge us, and they got our drink order, and we were told them we were ready, and they said they would get our server (who never came to our table at all, she was running around like it was busy, but it was not.) Our server ended up being a wonderful man named Andrew and he was so friendly and very attentive, made us feel like family, if I do go back I would request him, he took good care of us. When we did get our food, the portions were a good size, but the one thing I was so excited about turned out to not be amazing. I got the chicken finger platter with fries and a waffle, while my waffle was delicious, my chicken was a mixed bag. The meat was good, nice and moist, not dry at all, but the breading was boring. No seasoning at all. I love fried chicken, it is one of my favorite meals to eat, but if you don't have good breading then it is just pointless to me. If there was any seasoning, I could not taste it at all, but besides that my fries were okay, nothing to remember. At least my drink came in a big mason jar and was their home made lemonade which was very good on this hot summer day. My mom loved her French toast platter, and my daughter got a waffle breakfast sand which, which she seemed to like, and my server was very good. Technically it was a decent outing, but if your signature dish is a classic like fried chicken, you better have some amazing chicken, especially since there are so many choices here in vegas. The chicken meat was good, but the breading was terrible, and I know this sounds lame, but it's not worth it for me to come back. I will just go to churches or popeye's instead."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in Lo-Lo's!  Had been eagerly anticipating the opening and stopped by around 4 PM today.  Place was packed and food took a long time to arrive (which is understandable as they just opened a day or two ago). But my main disappointment was I ordered the #7 single chicken breast with waffle and when they brought it to me they brought a few chicken wings instead of the breast as they said they ran out of chicken breast.  This didn't make much sense to me as they kept delivering chicken breasts to other tables after telling me they were out.  The wings were a disappointment as there was no meat on them and I am not into eating things off the bone.  I really felt they should have comp'd my meal due to delivering me a meal I did not order.  Needless to say I took a few bites of the wings and then passed them to my husband and just ate my waffle.  My husband was not overly impressed with his meal either.  He too ordered chicken breast (3 of them) only to be given one breast and two other parts.  Not much meat on his either.  Not sure how you run out of chicken breast for some but not others....Not sure that we will be back..."}
{"text":"Bad. Custmer service. Experiance.  At front door.  So I left  I  was going to get food to go. The girl was. Not friendly. Or helpful. In what to order. She said. She wouldn't  know !"}
{"text":"After coming back after my previous review I have had a great experience. Getting the Soul Food Platter is always a must in my book. If you dig catfish try the piece of catfish w/ chicken. I ended up going with the mac and cheese and collard greens which were super good. Hope that Lo Lo's can keep up with the consistency and I'll be a long time customer."}
{"text":"I have been twice now and surprisingly the chicken and waffles was actually my least favorite thing we tried. It was good but nothing great, the waffles were ok.  I would like to see a nice Belgian waffle. What was amazing is their biscuits and gravy, which we had both times we visited. It is huge and they have a special kick to them which makes them far better than your average biscuits and gravy.  The Oreo pancakes are amazing and are dessert and breakfast all in one! Friendly servers making everyone happy even when it was full."}
{"text":"Tio Coach and Tia Edna took us here for lunch after playing and working up a hunger at the Gilbert splash pad (under the water tower). Didn't know there was a location in Gilbert!?! We had been to the location in Scottsdale years ago.....The Kool aid and Southern Style sweet tea are good enough to put you in a diabetic coma. Yea....it took a while to take our drink order but Coach talked to a guy and after that service was stellar! When coach talks most people know best to listen. 

Had the catfish with greens and loved every tender morsel. Service was slow and laid back so don't be in a rush for good Southern Food! Chillax Brah!"}
{"text":"Very clean and new restaurant. With family from Los Angeles, I have eaten the famous Roscoos Chicken and waffles and heard about this place and thought I would give it a try with a  friend. We ordered The KK and split it. The chicken and waffles were better than Roscos overall. The place is a little pricey and there is a $3 up charge to have one piece of white meat instead of all dark meat on the combo? The food was good but the Grits were terrible and so was the service. Slow to refill my drink and to take my order. a couple changes and they could get 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"Real close to getting 5 stars from me, gets better everytime. I'ver personally never had bad service or bad experience in the 4-5 times I have been. The hosts/greeters are always smiling, basically treating you like family and the waiter/waitress service has been the same, nothing but smiles, check back the right amount, not too much, not too little. The food is A-1 soul food, chicken has always been cooked to perfection, big wings and breasts(I'ma white meat guy), and I've liked their sides as much as any other soul food or bbq joint I've been to in Vegas, the sides could definitely be bigger though! Sweet tea and diabetes water, aka kool-aid is just as off the chain as it was when we were pouring a 1/4 bag in our home concoctions as kids!!!"}
{"text":"Nate and the staff was wonderful. We had a flight to catch and he made sure we had everything we needed and did it with a smile. The food was amazing and the portions were enough to feed an army. If you want great food and service you have to try this place. Soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Finally went over to try this place. One and done for me. The resteraunt was pretty busy on a saturday afternoon. It was very clean and nicer than I expected.

The staff was very freindly and offered great service. The food came out quickly, was warm and the order ws correct. 

The one problem, its not that great. The chicken is really average and the waffles are just waffles.  Large portions is a always bonus but at these prices they should be large.

My wife and I each got an entree and i had a sweet tea, the bill was $32.00. That is a lot of money for some average tasting food.

 The chicken skin was battered using heavy flour to the point that you could taste and feel the flour. It wasent for me."}
{"text":"The  chicken tender basket was so good! The waffle was amazing and the chicken was so moist and delicious! Definitely will be back! How can you not love a place that has kool-aid?!"}
{"text":"My gawd!!!! The lawd blessed the world with such joys and great golly moggly this is one. Came from outta town and wanna move in town just so I can eat here weekly. Highly recommended for tourist."}
{"text":"Over rated! Food came out cold and it was way over priced. The waitress had black teeth and messed up our order twice. I will never be back. Save your $ and go some place nice for what this place charges! Very disappointed! !"}
{"text":"These concerns were sent to Lolo's and were unanswered by them.  Price for this meal:  $84.60 including tax & tip.  We have eaten at this Gilbert, AZ location many times.  Monday, January 15, 2018 we took our oldest son to this location for lunch; his first visit.  He travels all over the U.S. for business and we only had a short time before he had to go back.  Our favorite is the Soul Food Platter with the Chicken Fried Chicken as our meat choice.  Before ordering, we noticed that the menu had changed and had listed a $2 charge for adding a breast so we asked our server if that was the same if we ordered the CFC; server checked and came back to tell us it was a $5 charge to add a breast to the CFC.  We asked if it would be the same boneless breast WITH the gravy.  The answer was yes.  We ordered the fried pickle appetizer and all 3 of us ordered the SoulFood Platter with the CFC, but each of us ordered different sides.  We also added a single CFC $5 breast to take with us and asked for the gravy to be on the side and have it put in a large to go box as we usually split one of the breasts with our meal and take the other with us for the next day.  The 3 meals were delivered, except the side of red beans came out with red beans and rice so the server took that back.  The 3 of us were visiting and kind of forgot about time during which the server brought out the single breast in a box in a plastic bag.  Came time to leave and we were brought the check, handed a credit card, finished our food, got the bill back to sign, and started getting the bag to put our meal CFC in to the small, cramped box, not even thinking about there not being a side of gravy.  While signing the credit card slip, I noticed that there was an additional charge of gravy which we understood was included in the $5 charge for the CFC BONELESS BREAST.  We looked around for our server but were running late to drop off our son, so we tipped on the card and left.  After we got home (which is about a 40 mile drive from this restaurant) we realized that what we thought was a $5 CFC BONELESS BREAST, was in fact a BONE-IN BREAST, there was a little gravy on it, but not the same.  Then we remembered that I never got my red beans!!  The food we received tasted good and didn't want to say anything in front of our son, but I felt that the candied sweets were a little skimpy serving; the gravy was a less than we were used to, and there were few green beans in the greenbeans/red potatoes.  We were disappointed to say the least.  Obviously, we should have taken it up with our server at the time (which we tipped 20% not realizing all the errors), but we were so busy visiting that we had to hurry to leave.  Therefore, we thought Lolo's should know of our disappointment and hope that now that they are expanding, that they don't lose what they started.  We will certainly think twice before bringing another guest to your restaurant especially in view of the cost and what we thought we were getting."}
{"text":"No more wondering it is scrumptious every last bite thanks Lo Lo for making our experience the best"}
{"text":"Lo Lo's was fantastic. Their fried chicken is fantastic and the service was exceptional. My family went there on opening weekend and, aside from the wait, couldn't say anything but glorious remarks. The chicken and waffles I ordered may very well be the best I've ever had. I'm sure it can only get better, so I'm excited to see the whole menu when they become fully operational"}
{"text":"Our first time trying chicken & waffles and Lo-Lo's didn't disappoint! The restaurant was spotless and service great. Server made suggestions while we were ordering and we enjoyed our meal very much. Manager came by our table and checked on us during our meal. We loved the breading on the chicken fingers. Waffle was so good and syrup tasty. We tried the fried green beans and they were great! We would definitely return next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I regularly love this place, I try to make it a weekly family spot. I decided to take my sister today it was a bout a 20-25 minute wait so we decided to just sit at the bar, the bartender BRADLEY quickly asked us what we wanted to drink and if we wanted menus. After he provided me with my drink he forgot my sisters but we did get a chance to put in a order, it took about 45-50 for us to get our food and my sisters drink. During the wait I tried to get BRADLEYS attention. I want to say I felt a bit discriminated against, due to the fact that the person sitting right by me was getting all the attention every 5 minutes but we weren't asked if we needed anything or how we were. When he brought out our food he wouldn't really acknowledged us or he seemed like we were bothering him, even for the bill it took some time we got there at 124p we ended up leaving at 257p."}
{"text":"I went last night with friends and it was an absolute mess in the restaurant.  We sat at the outside bar window at 6:20 and ordered right away and got our 2 salads and phat chicken sandwich at 7:43.  The reason for the delay we were told was that they were out of chicken breast.  How the hell does a chicken place run out of breast.  

The bartender tried her best but I guess they did not have someone on the to go orders so she was responsible for the bar and getting all for food for the kitchen when stuff was ready.  I would say the bar was unintended at least 50% of the time we were there.  

When I ordered my chicken sandwich the bartender talked about this great hot sauce they have in the kitchen and would give me a side with the sandwich.  When we finally did get our meals the guy from the kitchen came and dropped the meals off and walked right away.  It only took us another 10 minutes to grab someone's attention to get utensils to eat the meal with.  I never got the hot sauce as well as ketchup for 13 fries that came in the order.  My buddy actually walked inside and went behind the bar looking for napkins and forks and was back there for at least two minutes and could not find any.  Also one of the salads came out with zero dressing on it and zero on the side.  After five more minutes the bartender was back and went and got some dressing.  My other buddy asked for water and she said right away and we never did see that water.

We asked for the manager and was told they were too busy as they were also working the line and could not help us.  The last time I stopped in I got a chicken sandwich during lunch and after eating a bit realized it was pink on the inside.  The excuse I got was they were rushing to get the lunches out.  A manager did stop out to ask to make me a new one but I was already so disgusted I could not eat anything.  In true Lolo's fashion I still had to pay for a half cook piece of chicken.  

I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.  If you have a few hours to kill for an average meal and horrible service then you will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Do not let these negative reviews stop you!  Have eaten several times at the old Scottsdale location.  Had my first visit to Gilbert this morning with 2 friends.  We walked in just as a table was leaving so we were seated within 5 minutes.  Faith was our server and she was awesome.  She suggested the fried green beans, they were crisp, piping hot and Soooo good.  I got my usual, Betty Boop.  We split the mac & cheese as a side.  Again, everything came out quick and piping hot.  I love mine covered in syrup with a couple of shakes of hot sauce.  I literally closed my eyes and said mmmmm when that hint of cinnamony, sweet with a touch of heat goodness hit my taste buds.  I mean...really, some of the low reviews are based on when the place opened their doors.  If you are super particular about your server, ask for Faith when you visit.  She knows the menu and the food, she checks on you regularly.  She's awesome....and so is the food"}
{"text":"I gotta give them a one star because we have never in our lives been so completely pissed off at a waitress!! Before I start...Nate the manager is the ONLY reason we didn't walk out the door. The waitress Bre... she's the absolute worst waitress we've ever seen!! They should know that a horrible waitress will reflect on the entire restaurant. First, we waited 40 minutes to be seated, that's fine....we were advised of the wait time. We were seated at a middle table, party of 4 adults and a baby. After 30 minutes and no one came to take our drink order I got up and spoke to the host. Finally after a few more minutes waitress Bre came. She was full of excuses on why she neglected us. She then claimed if we wanted anything from the bar it would be a 15 minute wait because the alcohol was on the truck outside, which we later learned was a lie. We ordered water, soda, tea and one beer. She came back about 25 minutes later with the drinks except for the beer. She said she forgot and took off again. 15 minutes later still waiting on the beer we decided to chase her down again. Meanwhile we're actually noticing tables ALL around us, who were seated between 10-30 minutes after us, receiving their food. I chased Bre down again!! More excuses. It was obvious at this point she appeared to be refusing service without actually saying it. We asked for the manager....Nate came. We explained what was going on and he stepped up and got the food to us. The food actually seemed like it had been sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen because it was definitely not freshly plated and they brought it out in a hurry once I pointed out that every surrounding table was seated long after we were and had already received their meals......including many other tables being served by BRE! Why were WE being ignored by this lady? Even when we asked her for napkins...she took a long time, threw one on the table and attempted to walk off but he caught her so she dropped three more on the table. Even the to-go boxes!! She disappeared and never brought them. Nate had to get us boxes. This was beyond ridiculous! We arrived at 1:40pm and left at 4:04pm with half our food in to-go boxes. We were so incredibly frustrated and infuriated. We were a group of cousins who had not seen each other in 8 years.....thanks for ruining our lunch/reunion Bre. If the owner reads this....Nate is a good man and did his best to save our experience. He should NOT have to do that girls job! We're not sure we'll ever return. The food was not worth the complete train wreck our experience turned out to be."}
{"text":"On Friday evening of Feb. 12th, I ordered to go and picked up my order @ your take-out window. I like that you're able to park in the to-go spots at the Gilbert, AZ location because the heritage district is always busy at night. The main reason for my communication is the pleasant personality & great customer service that was provided by one of your employees. The gentleman's name tag said Mondo (sp.?) & he took my phone order along with assisted me during my pick-up. I only ordered two sides of collard greens & he was charismatic & witty helping me laugh & feel like he wasn't miserable at his job. So many times in the restaurant industry I as a customer feel like the worker doesn't even want to service my order but even though I did not order much, he delivered top knotch customer service. I will be back to your location thanks to this experience. I would have given 5 stars; however, the side orders of greens were somewhat pricey for the amount received ( a little over $10 )."}
{"text":"If I could rate a ZERO star I would!  Was told there was a 20 minute wait to be seated. That was a lie! Took 45 minutes.  When we finally did sit down, it took another 10 minutes for our waitress to come take our order. After taking our order it took another 45 minutes for our food to come out! 
Terrible service! Waitress didn't come by to check on us! Would not recommend this place! Try Phoenix location. Much better service!"}
{"text":"Loved the cornbread and the fried chicken. Our server Kiera was an absolute delight. She bent over backwards to not only provide exceptional service but also made us laugh and was very personable. Fast seating, our order came up quick, and when the kitchen was out of one of the things we ordered she led us know promptly and comp'd us some of our add ons. Some people would be annoyed that they ran out of certain items but I'd prefer they run out and serve fresh rather than over-order and provide stale food."}
{"text":"I have been here for minute and have seen tables of four get there food 15 minutes apart. My waitress has the personality of a stepford wife. I have Sen her once to take out order. No food update status. Well it's only been 30 minutes! Not looking good Lolo, maybe you need Lolo Jones to help speed things up? Wait okay now it's been 35 minutes.  Thought I would hold off on sending the post. Well damn 40 minutes and counting,  but hey the waitress came by to let me know the food will be ready soon. But she didn't ask if we needed anything! I have come to believe subpar is the new standard in restaurant service! Reach high Lolos, reach high! I don't know if I should laugh or be mad. Okay 45 mins. I think we should leave! WTH!! LOLOS YOU HAVE REACHED AN ALL TIME LOW, LOW! SKIES THE LIMIT!"}

{"text":"Best fried chicken I've had in a long time! Crispy, salty, tender and waffles were perfect!"}
{"text":"Never been here before but i will definitely come back! Loved the chicken, wasn't greasy. The waffles were light and fluffy. They have kool aid on tap ( purple or red), sweet tea and some drinks with alcohol too. The place is very roomy for large parties. Clean restrooms as well."}
{"text":"This is the worst of worst establishments I have ever eaten at here in Las Vegas and in  Arizona.  The long wait time and the no explanation or warning  that you are going  to wait a long time  is just rude. The establishment  act or treat you as if they are the important  ones and your begging  to be there to eat their  mediocre  food.I now refer as Lolola's no no no no...... If your food is good it goes unnoticeable because  your customer  service is so awful."}
{"text":"This location had the worst service ever!! Me and my best friend went here mid afternoon for breakfast. After placing our order it took 40 minutes for us to get our food. The reason we were told our order was late was because the chicken wasn't done. Don't know any restaurant that takes 40 minutes to make fried chicken. Even after getting our food half of my order was wrong. Plus my pancake was burnt like toast. Food was decent but I have had way better in Phoenix, AZ. Next we get our bill and the manager claimed the best he could do was take 15 percent off our bill. I will never eat at this location again!"}
{"text":"First time trying it out. On a Saturday, there was a large crowd but not overcrowded. They had 2000s rnb music on which was cool. The price is a little high for things. Soda comes in a big jar but it's $3.49. 1 waffle cost 4.49 so it's better to get a meal. Food was great! Waffle was so rich and the drumsticks weren't bad but I needed their hot sauce. Food came out fast for us. overall I would eat here again if I have the money for it lol. Try it out"}
{"text":"I've been here for about 30 minutes now and I'm already disgustingly disappointed with the service. I placed my lunch order 25 minutes ago and I'm still waiting. I just watched another couple who came in after us, get their food. It's a Wednesday afternoon and they aren't busy. I'm ready to walk out and go elsewhere.

*UPDATE* Our food finally came and the chicken is cold. WTF. Too bad. I would still recommend the one in downtown Phoenix, but stay far away from here."}
{"text":"Arrived to Lolo's at 9:56 p.m. the hostess excuse herself to talk to another employee and refused to seat us because they close at 10...... I would give them a zero if I could I will never go back there and I will strongly urge anyone I know to never go there I don't care how good the food could be or could have been.....I have heard it is amazing.....sadly I will never get to experience their food as I will never be back.

UPDATE
We went to another establishment to eat as we are being seated I mentioned the reason we were there was because we were turned away, apparently of the owner of Lolo's was sitting there and heard me after we finished our meal he approached us introduce himself was very apologetic. Ask for another chance invited us back for a meal on him which I was extremely pleased with... Standby for tomorrow evening for a full and honest review and revision of how many stars they will get. So nice to see business men care about their business and customers.


2ND UPDATE

Arrived approximately 9 p.m. greeted by the hostess and seated. Ordered the combo appetizer of fried green tomatoes, fried catfish, and fried green beans. I had the D D chicken and waffles. The food was absolutely amazing the fried green tomatoes were out of this world best I've ever had, the fried green beans where excellent the catfish was amazing. The chicken and waffles was absolutely incredible!

\" every bite was like the first bite all over again\"  

Obviously I changed to a five star rating and highly recommend dining there, the staff is incredibly friendly and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"It took a long time to get seated so we sat at the bar. The food was excellent. Be great place to social when they finally get their liguor license"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place. First off. What kind of restaurant doesn't answer their phone. Our office tried to call at 11am. Right as they were supposed to be open. It took us about 20 minutes to get someone on the phone to place our order. We were then told it would take 15-25 minutes before the food was ready. Perfect! We're a busy Doctors office and we get about an average of 45 minutes for lunch. Our rep, who was picking up the food was still there at 12 with no food. When he came to our office and we were organising everything, we realised we were short $26.00 worth of food. I've have been trying to call to fix the error and no one will answer the phone"}
{"text":"Best waffles around, best fried chicken also. I am not a huge waffle person,but theirs are delicious. Same with the chicken. We went in on a Saturday morning about 9 am and the place was empty. We have eaten at this location twice now, and the Scottsdale a bunch of times. Very friendly staff and lots of food options. Not just chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I never understood what Southern Comfort was until I came to Lolo's. As soon as you walk inside a has such a cool rustic Southern theme to it. My favorite is all the roosters around the restaurant and they're nice lighting. Even the music they play has some soul! Every time we go we were seated immediately. They give us menus for our kids to keep them entertained with crayons! The staff is great at checking on you during meal. And they also help answer questions mainly because I was never really familiar with a lot of stuff on the menu. Their portions are soo big. The lemonade and sweet tea are delicious. I've actually mix them myself and I've made my own Arnold Palmer but you can always ask for your own when ordering. I love their menu because we have so many options with chicken and waffle. You can get a breast, drumstick or thighs. My favorite is a chicken breast with a waffle and I also love their gravy and biscuits. The perfect time to come here if as soon as they open mainly because later in the day it gets packed. Especially on a Sunday. This last time we went we had a hard time getting the server's attention. We even sat next to the servers area where they put in the checks. Nobody gave us crayons this time or waters even straws were forgotten when they delivered our drinks. I had to go up and ask. Maybe it was a busy day but ill still some back"}
{"text":"The Mrs. and I came down to try out this place.  Heard a lot about it, and the southern culture is always appealing to me.  I had this weird notion that I would be looked at twice for being Caucasian or something...couldn't be further from the truth.

Whoever said this place has bad service was WAY wrong in my eyes.  A friendly hostess, waitress and busser made our experience really pleasurable.  We got Windy as our waitress.  Ask for her!

I had the breast and thigh and they were GREAT!  Juicy and just fell off the bone.   The waffle was equally as delicious.  I usually don't scarf meals down, but I crushed this one.

The atmosphere is very open. Has that cafeteria feel, so of that isn't your thing, ask for a booth or the bar.

All in all, I enjoyed it!  It is obvious that the place just opened, but there is a ton of potential here."}
{"text":"Came here with friends upon a great recommendation. We were out of towners from Chicago area looking forward to a great meal with friends living in the area. We were seated right away and ordered drinks followed by ordering our meals. Some 20 mins or so pass and our waiter tells us that our food shall be out shortly. Time passes and still no food. Our waiters dialogue now turns to 'since most of our party ordered chicken breasts, it would be a few more minutes while they find some more' (i guess the chicken and waffle place is out of chicken but they never directly tell us so) We are at about the 45 minute mark now with no food, while other tables are being served their meals, some being the chicken breasts they couldn't seem to locate that we ordered. Our waiter returns to inform us our food shall be out in 2 minutes as they were plating it. So our waiter can claim they were plating our meal but yet never deliver said meal. Over 10 minutes pass since our meal was being plated and we are encountered by what I would assume was a manager, no introduction was made. She did apologize for our food taking too long and said we could continue to wait for our meal or she could give us some chicken tenders. We came for the fried chicken and waffles not a 45+ minute wait for chicken tenders. When my friend proceeded to tell her we would just like to leave, she offered no reason for us to stay or rectify the situation other than, your drinks are on us and I can't force you to stay. If indeed the delay was for lack of chicken, why waste our time and prolong our wait time when they could ask us to relook the menu or decide to leave long ahead of our wait for meals we still dont know were ever coming to our table.  Thanks for the free soft drinks but this establishment was a huge letdown on our trip."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical to try this place out but I am glad I did. My friend and I came in for lunch Saturday 8/20 around noon. There was no wait to be seated. Our server was really sweet and came up to us right away to take our drink orders. We both got the sweet tea and damn it was good. It was so refreshing and cold, it really hit the spot on a hot summer day. I love that the drinks come in mason jars. Besides the sweet tea they have soft drinks and a few different flavors of kool-aid on tap! 

My friend ordered the shrimp and grits and I chose the Baby Ray which is 3 pieces of smothered chicken and 2 waffles. I asked for the gravy on the side though because I wanted to taste the chicken and wasn't even sure if I would like the gravy. My friend and I had a chance to catch up and after maybe ten minutes or so, our food came out. My food was delicious. I didn't think the chicken was greasy at all and it was very tasty. The skin was crispy, and salty with just the right amount of seasoning. The waffles were good too, large in size and a sprinkle of cinnamon in the batter. I enjoyed eating the chicken with the waffles and syrup, but I also liked dipping the chicken into the gravy, it was pretty good. My friend enjoyed her meal but said the grits needed salt. 

For dessert we got the banana pudding to share and it looked great, but I didn't care for it. It had a weird aftertaste and I wouldn't order it again. For both of our meals, drinks and dessert it was almost $50 which is a bit pricey for lunch, but because the food and service were good I would come back."}
{"text":"Came in with 3 friends...2 of us got chicken and waffles....chicken was good, waffles were ok. The other 2 got a burger and breakfast which they said was ok.
Service needs to improve... The waitress introduced herself and then said she had 2 large tables... It was weird and inappropriate. I have been a server. I wanted to leave immediately. A GOOD server balances her job with a smile and doesn't let her customers feel like a burden.
Despite the fact that the chicken was good I won't be back. Too many good places to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"The chicken was hot and fresh but lacked flavor. I didn't like the corn fritters but I'm not crazy about creamed corn. However it was very flavorful. We were seated right away and our waitress  Brianna was friendly and attentive. I would go back."}
{"text":"Yum! Wish we had a Lolo's down in Cali! The atmosphere is cozy and nice, staff was nice..... Food... Amazing. I had 1 breast, 1 wing, waffles, eggs & grits. Everything was made just right, the chicken had great flavor and the right crunch. The waffles still had a light crispiness to it when they brought it out ( I'm used to the waffles being soft even before I put syrup at the other places out here). And not only that, they had Kool aid!!!! So I had to go with the old school grape. And it was to perfection, Kool aid has a perfection you ask? Yes it does... Has to have the right amount of sugar... So I was totally satisfied with everything, especially the food, and so was family. Portion size was hefty too. Every Vegas visit will include a trip Lolo's!... Come to Cali please"}
{"text":"We have been to this location a few times now and the food has always been amazing. Chorizo is great, chicken cooked to perfection, waffles are crispy and soft & delicious. 
 The staff and service is overall good with a couple exceptions. Though they always have a great attitude.

Brunch on the patio is where it's at."}
{"text":"I'm usually not one to write about a bad experience, it's happened to all of us. But I haven't been able to shake this.

Eight months ago, I heard that LoLo's Chicken and Waffles was going to open in Downtown Gilbert. I was overcome with excitement and showed up with my fiancé this last Saturday (2/21/2015). There was a 45 minute wait, which didn't bother us, we took a nice walk and returned to a partially full restaurant with people waiting. We saw some open spots at the bar area, so we took our names off the list and sat down. The bartender (didn't catch his name) advised us that he wasn't ready yet, but he would take our drink orders and gave us a menu. I had noticed that it was a newer menu from past times I had gone to the downtown Phoenix and Scottsdale locations. My fiancé, being a vegetarian, saw some options she liked, but wanted to just create her own omelet since they had some options for omelets anyway in the menu. I stopped someone who appeared to be a manager or GM of some sort and asked if we could make a change to an already existent omelet that was on the menu. He proceeded to berate us and said, \"No. Absolutely not, this is not IHOP. Do you know how long it took me to make this menu? 8 months. I won't allow you to make changes to anything on the menu. There's a vegetarian selection, she can just eat that.\" He made a snide remark referring to her being vegetarian saying, \"I'm sorry\" then he said, \"God put animals on this earth so we can eat them.\" We ended up ordering her a chicken omelet without chicken and subbed the cheese for jack cheese (which didn't get made correctly).

I've never been treated like that at a restaurant and I hope that none of you get treated like we were. We finished our meal and paid our bill."}
{"text":"1st time coming here, and I was super excited.  It was very busy and I felt bad cuz where they sat us I had to shimmy into the booth and hit the guy next to me with my butt..... no room where those booths were. I ordered the award winning fat azz sandwich. Super disappointing.. the chicken tasted as if the batter had not been seasoned at all. Maybe I got a bad batch.. service wasn't the best, server didn't suggest anything when I said I had never been here before. On the plus side the kool-aide was awesome and I love that they had it! I got blue! The fries were yummy and had a great seasoning to them as well."}
{"text":"Yay!! Absolutely loved my order of gizzards. I musta never had them done right cuz these were tender, lightly battered, and seasoned. I just remember gizzards being hard pieces of fried something I would have to chew on a bit to be able to swallow. I know, I still ordered them because I was curious. Wasn't expecting much but was totally blown away.

F had the Tre Tre (2 chicken drumsticks and a waffle). Although I didn't try the chicken (next time), I did sample the waffle naked. (Major food phobia for me; syrup isn't allowed to touch savory foods.) The waffle had a nice cinnamon-y taste, softer than a traditional waffle. Good.

I had Uncle Brotha's Shrimp & Grits. My grits were creamy, full of flavor with nice sized shrimp, bacon, onions, mushrooms, and cheese. I am so glad I didn't change my mind about trying them. I mean, I had that on my mind when I first saw their menu online, but when I had the menu in my hand...well, there was soo much to choose from.  My meal came with one of the fluffiest biscuits I have ever had. (Can't wait to try their biscuits and gravy.) I could've used some honey for a touch of sweet for it or maybe even some honey butter, but that's just me. The biscuit and butter it came with was perfectly fine by itself.

I chose lemonade by itself (I'm a lemonade purist) though was very tempted by the grape Cool-aid/lemonade mix. It was very pretty. I know, but visual is a part of my foodie make up.

We went at 530p on a weekday and there was no wait to speak of. Service was wonderful. Our server was Jasmine, who was quick and funny. 

Both F and I commented on the fact we loved that our food was cooked at order. I don't understand people who go to a restaurant and expect their food in five minutes. I like that my food wasn't sitting under a warmer hoping that someone would order that particular dish.

Lolo's was another mark in the Win column. Can't wait for the next visit."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness so amazing! Waffles are soft with a crunch, and never cold! The chicken is tender and juicy! Have never been disappointed! It's definitely one of my family's nee favorite places to go. The only downside is the chairs are a bit uncomfortable.  Ask for a booth!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles
Gilbert, AZ
366 N Gilbert Rd. Gilbert, AZ 85233
(480) 207-6173

As you enter Lo-Lo's, you're greeted by a hostess and warm, welcoming environment. Glass windows reveal the kitchen where you can see the waffle batter being stirred, fried chicken getting cooked up, and other delicious desserts on display to get your mouth salivating. Large plasma TV's scatter the walls, while the bar overlooks Gilbert Road, featuring large, transparent garage doors that were opened up to let the cool, evening air flow inside. The dining room was plenty big, with red booths bordering the room and multiple tables filling up the rest of the space. There's also patio space, but we elected to stay inside for our meal. The restaurant itself is all new construction, and the place itself is well lit with nice hardwood flooring throughout. It's a colorful dining room filled with nice workers who greeted us along the way to our table. 

After a short wait, just 5-10 minutes, we were seated in a booth, and I made sure to face the TV's to see the game. For $3.50, I always order the purple Kool Aid which comes in a massive Mason jar, and stirred to perfection with extra heaves of sugar to sweeten it up. If you like super sweet Kool Aid, this is your stuff. I usually get refills as well. After looking through the menu to see if there's anything that sounds appetizing enough to sway me away from my go-to \"Lolo's\" meal, I decided I better stick with my gut, and order the usual. For $13, the \"Lolo's\" plate features two golden waffles and three pieces of fried chicken, your choice of what type - I stuck with a breast and two thighs. After 15-20 minutes of chatting, our food was here. My plate was filled to the max, with the fried chicken hanging off the sides. The waffles came with a large helping of butter, and a very warm glass of maple syrup. 

I got straight to business, no messing around; I smothered the warm butter on the waffles for that extra taste and dumped every last drop of the hot maple syrup onto the waffles, carelessly letting it settle under my chicken, giving it a little sweetness as well.
After debating whether to dive into the chicken or waffles first, I started to cut up my waffles and go to town. You immediately taste the amazing combination of warm syrup that melts the butter into the slightly cinnamon waffle batter. Absolutely scrumptious! For those of us with a sweet tooth, they know what I mean when I say I just bit into heaven! 
The best way to go about this massive plate, is to alternate between the chicken and waffles, so the sweetness of the waffles isn't overwhelming. 
The fried chicken was too hot to bite into initially, and after enjoying the waffles I went in for the first bite. The skin slides right off the meat, and the chicken was chewy and delicious! Plenty of moisture, not too dry - and the perfect seasoning. A salty taste with some hints of pepper seasoning makes this chicken absolutely delicious. 
When all was done, 2 waffles devoured and over a half pound of chicken, I was ready for a nap! What an odd but amazing combo fried chicken and waffles is! I was a skeptic at first, but after visiting this location multiple times, I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"You know how you go to most comedy movies to have a good time?  You don't really expect complicated plots or deep meaning.  You want to go, enjoy the experience, and leave with a pleasant feeling.

That is what you will get at Lo Lo's.  If the service is good, you will enjoy the surroundings,  the vibe, and  the cheery service.  And you will eat comfort food that will leave your stomach feeling like a dog that just got a belly rub.  But don't look for sophistication in the food or presentation.

I have been to the original Lo Lo's in downtown Phoenix and now at this Gilbert locale.  Each has their own vibe.  But they definitely have a vibe.  In Gilbert, it is similar to some of the surrounding restaurants: seating part indoors, part outdoors, plenty of TVs on mute for sports and whatever, fresh décor, and music with a pulsing beat...just enough to keep you awake, not too much to annoy or detract from conversation.

The menu is like a Chinese menu--mix and match most anything on their menu in different combos, including all-day breakfast items, which I personally enjoy.  Most combos are of their signature fried chicken, waffles, along with grits and other Southern faves.

So I tried their marquee fried chicken (a thigh) and a waffle, along with a couple scrambled eggs, grits, and home fries.  The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and my waiter was very cheerful and had been helpful with any questions about the food.

The chicken was hot and juicy, the breading crisp, not greasy, but it lacked any distinguishing flavor.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked to a light crisp brown all over, mixed with cooked onions and sweet peppers.  My nit is that the potatoes seemed to be a bit too salty.  The waffle was the thinner kind. It was just a little crisp.  It was flavorful, but again, not outstanding.  The grits were cooked enough to make them smooth, served with some butter to add flavor.  I've had grits elsewhere where the kitchen either added more flavor (garlic or cheese...the latter is an add-on to the grits here) or cooked them really smooth and creamy--memorable.  These were not the memorable kind, sorry to say.  Finally, the eggs were cooked properly, nothing special.

The menu is put together in a fun way, changing the spelling on different things for fun.  And my wife and I definitely enjoyed ourselves.  

So go for the atmosphere and the vibe, the comfort food and decent prices.  Just don't expect to get your socks knocked off."}
{"text":"I saw the biggest chicken breast ever here, good but scary. Was that chicken shot up with hormones or what? Most people think if you have a huge piece of chicken you just hit chicken lotto. I do have to say it was good and I had that meal for three day. Don't get me wrong it was down right good. Seasoned will cooked properly. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Went here as a group of 8 to celebrate my friend's daughter's talent show performance and we were told it would be a 30 minute or less wait.  Half the restaurant was empty.  Adults waited at the bar where the nice bartender who was both bartender and waiter took forever with the drink orders.  Asked the hostess twice after half an hour had passed how much longer and they said another five minutes, twice they said this and then they told us another 3 minutes. I asked if we could sit in empty area or even outside and they said they only had one server handling it so they couldn't??45 minutes later we were seated in the main dining area. Ordered immediately and drinks took another 12 minutes to come out and no straws either.  I had to get up and get those myself. Took another 30 minutes to get our food. And the food was mediocre and overpriced for chicken.  Wine costs $7 which is more than a local bar!! Needless to say we tipped badly and doubtful we will ever be back.  Management was nowhere to be found and when I asked for the manager they never appeared.  This place needs to retrain and add more staff as the servers clearly needed help and didn't seem very experienced.  They were nice the whole time while I tried to remain calm but I blame management who should have stepped in and helped out.  Should have comped our dinner or drinks or something too.  The prices need to be readjusted as it's way too high. What a shame.  Not coming here again."}
{"text":"We were there the day the Southern Nevada Health District came in from what we understand the second time and closed them down because of unsanitary conditions in their kitchen, employees observed not washing their hands after exiting the restrooms twice, we were shown a badge and asked to, leave! To add insult to injury, the server gave us a bill for the food we had ordered but, had not yet received, just the drinks! Told him to send the bill to management!! From what I understand it is now permanently closed!"}
{"text":"Food, Service, was Excellent. However, there was no Soap inside Men's Restrooms for hand washing. Kind of Gross imo"}
{"text":"This food was the bomb! I really don't know what people are talking about saying otherwise. I almost didn't go but I'm glad I did! I think it's just a matter of different tastes in food. This food is rich and full of greasy goodness and I loved it!! So much flavor! They have kool-aid! Lol"}
{"text":"Terrible... So terrible. We waited close to two hours for FRIED CHICKEN! Their specialty! For the love of God, were they plucking the feathers out of the chicken themselves? Ridiculous. I'd rather spend my money on Popeyes down the street who has better fried chicken and better service for a fast food chain. Don't waste your life here. This place is a total rip off."}
{"text":"Had to come back here after experiencing it for the first time last year. The chicken and waffles are just as delicious as I remembered. Ordered the Betty Boob like before. Also got fries with gravy added but didn't care much for the gravy due to the onions. Would skip that next time. My FIL really enjoyed the iced tea."}
{"text":"We had went to the LoLo's in Scottsdale and had a bad experience 6months earlier. We had a hour wait for our food. We decided to try Gilberts restaurant.  Everything was perfect. Our order was taken quickly and we got our food quickly.  My husband had fried chicken plate. Which he loved. I tried his Mac&cheese and corn bread. Which was very good. I had a catfish & grits plate. I really liked the lightly breaded catfish and grits. I also ordered a side of fried okra. Which was OK. I ordered bread pudding. It was pretty good. We will definitely be back for another yummy meal!"}
{"text":"Went to Lo-Los for breakfast. We were seated right away, but waited an hour before our meals came out. No fun waiting for the first meal of the day with kids!! Also, I was given something (completely) different then the menu described, and when I asked the waitress about it she said it was a typo. Hmm....really? This isn't your first location right?"}
{"text":"While visiting a friend in Arizona decided to try LoLo's and was surprised by their mediocrity. The catfish was great the shrimp and grits average at best grits were super thick with no flavor. Macaroni is more of a velvetta consistency. To top it off after I left the restaurant my card was charged an additional $17.97 about 45 minutes after leaving this establishment. I called and spoke with the manager Christina who explained I was rung up wrong and the waiter adjusted my charges. This whole process made me feel totally uncomfortable I did not authorize these charges I signed for a different amount so I felt as though I did not authorize the additional $17.97 and charging my card without my permission is essentially fraud."}
{"text":"I wish there could be an option for zero stars. Let's start with the waiter. He showed us to our booth.and before we could sit down and take a look at the menu he was asking what did we want to drink. We had water because we had not had a chance to view the menu. Shortly afterwards he returned with the water and wanted to take our order so I felt rushed and hurried up and gave a choice. I order the southern choice meal that came with 3 pieces of chicken 2 sides and a muffin. A short period later a female came over with our order. Needless to say I had a wing breast and leg. My wing was partially done, full of grease, and golden brown. My breast and leg were dark, salty, and tasted like it was cooked in old grease. The server returned with the bill. This is by far the worst food that I have tasted since I've been in Vegas. I can admit that my sides of dirty rice and collard greens weren't bad. But the greasy old salty chicken turned my stomach.and made me nauseous. So the whole meal was not a winner. I don't think I will be returning to this place with the awful service. This was my second time visiting this restaurant and my first time was great. I received great service and the food was delicious which prompted a return visit. This visit have become a stop sign and I doubt if I return."}
{"text":"1st time at this location, which is much closer to home!  We live it.  Chicken & waffles was great...wife got Mac & cheese with bacon and shrimp.  She said it was great.  The biscuit but came with was home made and crazy good!  I'd like to say I'm going to try it but to be honest, I'm getting the chicken and waffles every time!

Oh, did I mention home made syrup?"}
{"text":"Great chicken and I had the shrimp and grits.   Best in Vegas for me so far.  Great experience and great service."}
{"text":"I love this place great food and people. Also the drinks are strong as they should be. The stupid fries are insane"}
{"text":"Went yesterday and the doors were locked worth a sign staying closed until further notice reinspection failed. But there has been no consistency in the food since they opened"}
{"text":"The service was good. I was escorted to the restroom lol. They made me feel welcomed here. My food was as good as Roscoes if not better. I have been a patron of Roscoes for over 30 years. I lived near the Gower Roscoes at one time. I know chicken n waffles. The hot sauce was even good. My chicken was seasoned juicy & crispy. My waffle was good also. It tastes like the Roscoe's waffle. I will be coming back.  If you don't want a long wait, go through the week off peak hours. Lolo's it's worth it"}
{"text":"Another disappointment in downtown Gilbert. This summer I've been to all of the new, upscale restaurants on Gilbert Road. Gilbert, you attracted cute, chic, hip places - and everyone of them forgot the most important thing about restaurants: the food matters. Lolo's was my last stop. Too bad.

Ambience: absolutely horrible. The hard floors made for a very noisy environment. There were just six of us, and I couldn't hear what someone across the table was saying. A large part of the noise was the background \"music\". You know that godawful sound that eminates from some cars - that loud thump, thump, thump. Well, that's what the sound system was playing. Very bad feeling.

Employees: there were sure a lot of them, most of them hanging around together chatting, and not taking care of customers, cleaning, or doing anything. The few that were working did a good job. My waitress spoke very softly and it was impossible to hear what she was saying.

Food: I had chicken and waffles. The chicken didn't have any flavor - rubbery, tasteless. Even the skin! You can't just toss the chicken in flour and cornmeal. You have to add some spices. Some salt, pepper, even some red pepper - anything! KFC has far more flavor. When I go out, I expect to get food made better than I can at home, and Lolos missed completely. My buttermilk fried chicken is far superior to Lolos. The waffles were soggy and rubbery. No crunch. The flavor was no better than what comes in freezer section at the grocery store. The syrup was ok - real maple would have been better. I'm sure this was just a HFC product, but at Lolos, I don't think health concerns are on the menu.

This was a complete bomb. Lolos owners need to wake up, bring in a real and talented chef, get the menu up to par. Get an interior designer to make the place more warm and friendly. Until then, I won't come back under any conditions. One last thing: one fellow diner had the red velvet cake - it was awful. Texture, taste - everything was bad, bad, bad. You can't just hire some kid off the street and call them a baker - you need to hire a genuine pastry chef and do it right or don't do it at all!"}
{"text":"Okay someone told me that this place was a good place to eat at so I took my honey tonight and we went there can I tell you the customer service was lousy though hostess had a standing there for like 10 almost 15 minutes while she right on a chart board I said maybe be seated please she said just a minute and made us stand there for like 10 minutes seriously okay so then we sit she finally set us down we sat down for about I'm say 30 minutes no one even came over to say hello take our drink order nothing it was just awful so we finally got put we finally called somebody over and said Can someone please help us so she took our order she went to the back they didn't have a lot of stuff that was on the menu they didn't have a lot of sodas it was just awful experience I would never eat there again then a top it off the damn power went out so I couldn't even pay the check the right way so they have some old credit card machine and they swiped in the card  like that and going back and forth girl it was just a mess but for me I would never go there again oh and I'm sorry the food was awful that was some nasty nasty unseasoned mushy waffle unseasoned chicken it was nasty just nasty In Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Contrary to many of the unfavorable reviews, our experience at lunch today was entirely positive.  We arrived at the height of lunchtime and the place was crowded.  We got seated right way, and our food came within ten minutes of ordering.  The chicken and the waffles were both delicious.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  The check came before we finished our meal.  Even so, we were not rushed, rather we were encouraged to take our time.  Perhaps they have smoothed out their initial problems and upped their game.  In any case, would recommend. It's not exactly soul food, but it's darn good - kinda like Chevys is not exactly Mexican food..."}
{"text":"My experience was a disaster to say the least. I was served raw food after waiting 45 minutes. Then waited another hour for it to be corrected. It was shrimp! At most it takes 3 minutes to cook. The staff was okay but one of the waitresses advised me the manager was dumb and messes everything up. Totally unprofessional! The table next to me waited more then an hour for their food and another lady got raw chicken. In all my guest ate alone and we paid more then 30 bucks for her meal and drinks alone and I left with my cold food in a to go bag. Very unpleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat your treats...selection of bites on the menu. Wide open space and good music.
Meet and greet is warm...followed up by management and server with a great smile...
I'm patiently waiting for my food...fresh drop on the deep fryer... YES!
My wife and I walked in before 11Am and beginning to get packed...this place must be really good!"}
{"text":"I have been to this one and a couple in Arizona. I really like the food and the ambience. I love their catfish and and the kool aid lol .... great for brunch but those are the busiest hours so be prepared for a wait time"}
{"text":"Food was good, staff was nice but the wait was long.  That should speak to the food quality."}
{"text":"Excellent.  We came on Tuesday morning to get breakfast.  Lo-lo's didn't disappoint us!  Service is great, our server was friendly, courteous and efficient. Now about the food.  The waffles are excellent, chicken was  flavorful and the grits were creamy and tasty.  We will definitely be back before we leave to go home."}
{"text":"On Monday the 22nd of June, my family and I decided to give Lolo's another chance after a horrible experience opening night (somewhat understandable).

We entered the establishment at about 6:45pm. The greeter smiled and said hi upon arrival. She commented on my toddler's independent mind as he tried seating himself. There wasn't a wait so we were seated pretty quickly.  

We had to ask someone for a high chair for my son. The young lady who helped us with the high chair was fairly quick in bringing one over however, she left a spare chair next to our table in an already semi-crowded dining area.

As we looked at the menu, we chose our meals & even desserts, we started noticing people seated after us were already getting drinks and their orders taken. 

My wife walked up to the greeter and explained our concern. I was still at the table but from my point of view she understood our concern. Once my wife walked back to our table we sat and waited for our waiter/waitress. Ten minutes and still nothing. We calmly got up and walked back up front and mentioned to the same greeter how we were dissatisfied. Her response was, \"that's the manager.\" Couldn't even have the manager come up to meet us, simply pointed her out. 

We expressed to the manager how it's the second time we've had the same poor service. She apologized and offered us to stay and enjoy a personally served meal by her at no charge. Unfortunately, we're not after free food. Just good \"southern-style\" service.

Note for Gilbert LoLo's: I'm not going to say your staff is crappy or untrained. I will say a little customer service goes a long way. You should thank the other locations, especially the one inside sky harbor airport, for getting people hooked on good food and good service at their locations."}
{"text":"Loved!!! Nick (bartender/server) was awesome!!! Everything from food, service, atmosphere/ music was PERFECT!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this place for sometime or should say every wednesday night on my way to the rink I do. The name peak my interest. Yelper Suzy H planning on checking it out asked if wanted to tag along. Always down for trying the newest food spots in Vegas plus eating with someone else always makes the meal more enjoyable. Yelp style not just one dish but multiple dishes share family style. We ordered few things for lunch. 

We started with some Spicy Corn Fritters. I was pleasantly surprise. I thinking just be more normal jalapeño popper deep fry no big deal. They had so much more depth with the corn batter and just right amount of heat from the diced jalapeños. Fried nice golden brown. Moist. Not sure the sauce came with but honestly spicy corn fritters addicting by itself. I tried the sauce nothing memorable the once had one really addicting not stop. 

The Three piece chicken and waffles. Really average at best. The thing that never worked for me was the the breading dipped the chicken in. The chicken on the inside was cooked perfectly through nice and moist. The portion size of the chicken is awesome. Just fried chicken is only AS goos as the breading. It just never did anything for me compare to other fried chicken spots around Vegas. I felt like heavy breading or not light breading. Bite into it not  as crispy. The waffles talk about dense. Waffles were so dense nothing fluffy about them. Me that turn off. They cooked nice golden brown on the outside. 

The side of cornbread was ok. The size was huge. No way getting cheated on side of cornbread that for sure. 

The pineapple upside down pancake. By far was the best part of lunch. The combination is something unique. I loved it. The pancakes was nice fluffy just the way like my pancakes or waffles. The flavor was insane. It really tasted with dessert just in pancake form. There was ample amount of pineapples on top and in the batter. Not over the top that all you taste. Best way describe it really kick ass pineapple upside down cake just in another form. No need for syrup. The pancake has that much flavor. Oreo and Red Velvet that soooo on radar next visit. 

The service was without doubt FIVE star. We came on soft opening or should say second day open to the public. The full menu still not gone into effect. Our server forget her name was awesome. We even asked moved different table cause ordered  lot of food for two. Never makes for good pictures with natural light all up in your pics. LOL. Not only our server every came contact with walks past was friendly, attentive, looking feedback on the food, and great service. The decor like the whole chicken all over the place from statues or artwork. It gives Lo-Lo personality."}
{"text":"I love the service and some of the plates at Lo Los ... Their Arnold Palmers and the catfish beignets are amazing however if you like crispy and fluffy waffles this place isn't for you. Their waffles are thin and a little mushy. The chicken and other fried foods are good but sometimes a bit too greasy. I do want to make a few comments though and it's about my experience today. I went in and had a salad for the first time. I know maybe you just don't order a salad here but I did today . I got the salmon croquette salad and wish I didn't. It wasn't a croquette but more of a frozen patty like thing with absolutely no flavor. Secondly, the salad did not come with any of the things it said on the menu. Furthermore, the dressing that was given to me was pure oil. Basically, the salad was terrible and the server realized it and saw how terrible it was . He apologized but did not even take it off the bill. I had one bite and that was it.  He said do you guys want me to get the manager so we can take it off the bill and I feel that's something he should just do. He already went to the back three times to get things for the salad that were missing and I didn't want any more trouble. I recommend don't put things on the menu if they aren't very good. Overall, I'm still giving three stars because usually the service is great and if you are getting something fried you can't go wrong either. But lo los needs to step it up on stuff like this and allow your serves to make judgement calls on taking things off the bill when clearly the order was botched. That's how you ensure you don't lose people."}
{"text":"My husband makes better soul food then this. Heard so much raving about this place. Chicken is plain seasoning but crispy. Mac n cheese no rave there just some plain Ol Mac n cheese. Fried okra ok it's frozen not fresh. Not even crispy and plain seasoned the okra. The staff was awesome but food nope. Kool aid was good but killed with sugar. First and last time I will be trying this place. Until they get some seasonings in the foods."}
{"text":"I'm used to Roscoes Chicken n Waffles but this place is by far 10xs better! We ended up getting UncleBrothas shrimp and grits the bacon, shrimp, cheese with onions and one big ass biscuit would have to be my last meal if I was ever on death row!

We also got YoMamas Biscuits and Gravy and I can't put my finger on it but this gravy is amazing and again these biscuits are light and fluffy and big!! 

And that Kool-aid though... 

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I ordered a lil dish ( can't recall the name),  watermelon koolaide, and a side of mac 'n cheese. Came out quicker than I'd expected( based on other's experiences). Two pieces of chicken hot enough to have just been cooked, the beans and rice side dish was hot but disappointing. In a small dish sat a mound of white rice topped with a tablespoon of beans, no sauce no substance. The mac 'n cheese was lukewarm, at best, not freshly prepared and lacking any distinguishing flavours. I had to put ground centuries ago black pepper on it. The watermelon koolaide in a large mason jar was refreshing, would have preferred cherry but they don't have that either( no liquor license). Ambience? None unless screaming kids is your thing while eating and paying $15 for lunch. Not mine. A no no for me."}
{"text":"Y'all are opening up too many cans in this kitchen to justify the prices on the menu. A $13 stack of pineapple upside down pancakes was advertised as having fresh pineapple on top, but was served plain with several chunks of canned pineapple griddled into the batter. I enjoyed the sweet flavor of this indulgent dessert-for-breakfast, but truth in menu matters.

The child's size serving of mac and cheese was a large bowl for $5 that no one wanted to finish due to its tangy flavor and gooey texture. A few small grey pieces and specks gave away the secret ingredient: cream of mushroom soup... from a can. This is a staple of my mom's signature casserole, Chicken DiVan, but I don't like it in my macaroni.

I sampled the waffle and grits served with my husband's fried chicken, but the grits were unseasoned and covered in butter (or margarine, more likely) and the waffle tasted like cinnamon. It wasn't a bad breakfast and our friendly waitress (Leigh is the name on my receipt) did a great job, but these recipes just aren't for me. I feel like soul food should not be about shortcuts. Las Vegas already has plenty of good local breakfast eateries, and I'll happily drive a few more miles east on Lake Mead Blvd for my gritz fix in the future."}
{"text":"Want mediocre service? If the answer is yes than you'd definitely want to eat here. Me and my party had to wait a substantial amount of time for our food to come out. When it did arrive there wasn't anything spectacular about it to justify the 40 minute wait, it was two of us. The server was very inattentive and when we had questions he just told his boss that we wanted to speak a manager, which we did not! The manager came over and immediately offered us 10% off our bill like we were looking to complain to get free crap. Overall I will not frequent this establishment again and will recommend that my family and friends don't as well. Oh and the yellow tinted sugar water they sell as lemonade is absolutely the most disgusting thing I've ever tried in my life. I attempted to drown out some of the sweetness with water and it was still to suitable to drink."}
{"text":"The foods is pretty ok not great but average at least for the waffles.   The chicken always seems to be dry and tough and has almost no flavor.  The service is always slow and poor it takes forever to get anything and forget about refills so order enough drinks to complete your meal.   The restaurant is usually crowded especially on weekends of course and making this worse they won't take reservations even for a large party of 10+ which make's it impossible to have a family get together here which is truly unfortunate.   They estimated the wait could be a hour and it's usually much longer than they esimate and with a minuscule waiting room this is almost impossible.   It's too bad really when a  supposed family restaurant in a small Town atmosphere like Downtown Gilbert isn't family friendly.  So will pass from now on,  I mean sitting for several hours to eat a good waffle and tough dried out chicken isn't the way to celebrate with your family or friends.  I no Gilbert was supposedly lucky and this restaurant was highly anticipated but honestly I don't get it at all and won't go back.  

Well friends wanted to try it so we went again and if anything it was worse.  the chicken was the same dried out tasteless mess but now the waffles were not even good.  Honestly the food tasted about like frozen ego's and microwave chicken that is overcooked.   I honestly don't understand chicken and waffles as a meal and if you want that rather odd combination this isn't even a good version of either."}
{"text":"It wasnt up to the hype for me, don't get me wrong it was pretty good. I just didnt think it was that good ive had better. As for the waffles it was stale and flat even before i drenched it in syrup. Batter used seemed to taste bland. There definitely was a wait but i was already well aware of it going in. As for service it was on point server was friendly and informative of their products. He also let me know ahead of time that the food was taking longer than expected before i commited to ordering.  He kept the drinks full no need for asking a refill. Overall good atmosphere great service. But for me not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had high hopes...I would need to be high for it to have any hope. We sat at the bar and ordered corn fritters as an appetizer and I got a LoLo's punch. My husband got tenders and a waffle, I ordered a waffle sandwich with eggs and cheese, and cheese grits. A couple sat down beside of us, they were almost finished eating by the time someone went to check on our food. The corn fritters came out with our meal...40 minutes after we ordered. They were extremely greasy...I know they were deep fried but the oil temp must have been too low because they were saturated. My sandwich came out incorrect, on Texas toast and i said I had ordered a waffle sandwich and was argued with about what I ordered...broke my personal rule and sent it back (does that look like spit to you?) moments later the sandwich contents had been scraped on top of a soggy, lukewarm waffle and returned to me. The grits were inedible. I grew up south of the Mason Dixon line, and if you also grew up in the south, don't bother ordering these. Paula Dean herself would have said too much butter...and no amount of butter or cheese could have salvaged these, a step above wallpaper paste. 

My husband fared only slightly better; he never got any syrup or condiments, and had to ask for a fork as his silverware was just a knife. He thought the chicken was okay - he compares all Las Vegas chicken to The Chicken Shack, and it was subpar by that standard. He was also disappointed in his waffle.

Even though we were sitting at the bar, no one checked on us or offered us refills, or asked about our meal. It seemed extremely chaotic and unorganized, and I'm not sure how safe it is to have an electrical cord draped over the bar sink. 

Disappointing food, disappointing service, and a wasted Friday night dinner. LoLo's = NoGo"}
{"text":"We love the fried chicken, and they have a lot of combination to go with the fried chicken here. The one waffle and two chicken ( lil Jay or Jane) filled me and hubby up and it's only $7 or $8 bucks!!! We usually add two eggs to complete the meal.   So so good."}
{"text":"If you are planing to come to this place be mentally prepared for 2hrs wait..1hr to be seated  and 1 more to get you food,,very disorganized very disappointed. .The chicken teasted likes it's from KFC  and the waffles from IHOP might as well go there so you don't spend half your day waiting to eat and $14 for a eggs waffle. .."}
{"text":"Wow, never had this combo before, chicken and waffles. My chicken fried steak with sausage was outstanding and also very large portion as well as the waffles, with nice and ward syrup."}
{"text":"Headed over to Lo-Lo's after a disappointing stop at Barrio Queen next door and oohh boy what a treat. Started off with our server, E.J. who really made the visit an experience. Very personable, had good recommendations when we said it was our first time and made sure our visit was exceptional. Got a chicken breast and waffle, chicken was good but the waffle was great. Next time I go I'll probably just get a stack of waffles. Another person in our party got the pancakes and they were very good as well. Finished the meal off with a creamsickle \"drank\" and the blue koolaid/lemonade mix which was also a lot better than I thought it'd be. If it's really just koolaid I must have been making it all wrong when I was a kid. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Me and my family love this place!!! It was our 1st time coming here and we have fell in love with place... this will be now our new Favorite spot we come to Vegas. The Kool-Aid is the bomb!!!! You should come try out this place!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Waffles were mushy, not crisp at all. Chicken was way over cooked and poorly seasoned. Great location in downtown Gilbert. I wonder what will replace this disappointment."}
{"text":"Waited ten minutes. A server doesn't even come over. Wait I take that back server comes over and asks if us, a two adult one child table, are together with a six top. We say no. She's goes right to their table. We sat before that other table and they got their order taken and drinks before we were able to. 
 We look up and see four people standing around the bar talking and laughing too!! (People that worked there) 
Word of advice. Don't ignore your tables. We were out to spend money. I guess you don't want our money!! 

Terrible service 

Only second d time visiting and we live two minutes away. You're losing your local demographic by giving this kind of service.

To the managers that were standing right with their workers laughing and carrying on, you never said a word to a single table while we were there"}
{"text":"I wished I had read the reviews before going  .....the worst dining experience i've literally ever had in my life. waited way too long for a table ....it was sunday,ok...
had to wait to even order drinks because there was no clean glasses to serve ...again sunday ....still alright
finally get served like 2 hours after arriving we  get swarmed with bees seriously swarmed my friend's mom even got stung twice . at this point i've lost my appetite i show the employee there's literally bees in my food i can't even eat anymore ...me, my wife and children at this point have had enough and just wanted to be compensated on a portion of the bill instead they called the cops and wanted the bill paid in full hahahaha  this place will definitely be getting reported ....To the management your establishment is a joke and I would never return except for when i'm downtown drinking and go to your patio to take all my pisses"}
{"text":"Well, if this place were called Lo-Los Customer Service, they'd get 5 stars. They are always friendly and kind. Their food, however, is not up to par with other chicken and waffles places. I tried this place twice. Once right after they opened, and once last night. I thought that they had opening jitters so I gave them another shot. 

Chicken--- Both times, the smaller pieces (legs and wings) were heavily overcooked. I'm not a chicken cooking expert, but you cant cook a huge breast with tons of meat and a tiny wing with little meat for the same amount of time and expect the same results. One of the pieces last night tasted like it was cooked in old frying grease. 

Waffle- Both times the waffle was OK taste wise. But both times it was cold, not hot at all. 

Sides- Had the cole slaw on my visit last night. Very tasty.

Drinks- On the 1st visit, they did not have their liquor license. Last night, I had the Lo-Lo's Punch (Kool-Aid, Vodka, Pineapple Juice). It was very good.

On my 1st visit they were VERY busy and people were waiting for food. When I went last night, not so busy. The chicken wasn't HOT. They need to find a balance to their demand to keep food hot and fresh. 

Good luck to them!!!!"}

{"text":"Service was great, staff was friendly, and food was awesome! I had the two drumsticks and one waffle. Was a great plate!"}

The second time around when I ordered the lil'sis they took out all vegetables. Served me a sausage omelet with a crap ton of cheese it was a hot mess. Completely ruined my meal. And the service here is horrible it's just only 4 tables filled at 3pm on a Monday and our server , Chevy , vanished for the entire meal ! Did not check on us once to see if the food was correct. Had to have a different server take the dish back after 20 mins of sitting here waiting of course. Service is bad and food isn't the best , go to M&M soul food ! They are so much better !!"}
{"text":"So we came in after church on a sunday. no kidding there was two parties waiting. 1 party of 3 one party of 2. no one outside waiting.. waitresses standing around  talking. no big deal. i see numerous open seating in and outside.  the young man says it will be an hour wait.. AN HOUR!! with open seating, talking staff and two parties waiting?? not okay.. i was up for a bit of a wait but come on so i walked down the way and found amazing food .. ill try again lolo's but this has been strike 2..."}
{"text":"I live in Gilbert so I was excited to find out they were opening up a location downtown. My family and I went for a late lunch on 02/19 and it wasn't what I expected. The food was good but the service was not. I am not harping on the wait time I know going in I am going to have to wait a good hour or so, but the service could have been so much better. While eating lunch I witnessed 3 customers approach the manager to make a complaint and that was in an hour time frame so just imagine what a day looks like."}
{"text":"Bad Azz Samich was fair.  It was a $12 sandwich, which is double than many surrounding shops around for a sandwich,  but i paid it because i wanted something special and it was held prominent on their menu as one of the best.   However it was not good.   I feel like I could have gone to burger king and gotten a better fish sandwich and I font ever eat fast food.   To  feel like I paid double to get a fast food sandwich  I so i am letdown."}
{"text":"This was my first time and I had heard very good things about this restaurant so I was excited to try it. We got there and it wasn't too busy so we were seated right away which was nice. Our server took our drinks order which was 6 waters and 2 bloodys, he took no joke 10 mins to grab those which was frustrating. Then he took our order and the food didn't take too long but he forgot some food and some wasn't even ready yet. One person at our table was missing a sauce on his burger and our server took FOREVER to go back and just get a side of it!! Our whole table was basically done eating before he brought it over and he rest of the food he had forgotten. Bottom line, the service was terrible and the food was alright. I can say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Reviews were pretty accurate for this one: food was amazing but service was slow and the only employee that seemed to be working hard was our server, lucky for us. Makes sense why it was the only spot in Oldtown Gilbert without a wait."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the downtown Phoenix location for a while now, though I haven't been since they expanded that one. I was excited to see Lolo's open up in Gilbert a while back and we finally had a chance to come in. Well, service was on the slow side. Took about an hour for our food to come and when it did it was one dish at a time. A lot of other tables were waiting too... Apparently they ran out of waffle batter. Seems like an important thing to keep on hand in a chicken and waffle joint. Having had the chicken numerous times I decided to try the shrimp and grits; having visited South Carolina in the past year I've become a fan of that dish. It was good but I've had better. Everyone else enjoyed theirs. My mom reported that her collards were too salty, which is saying something. I tried them and they just tasted off to me. One other thing bugged me, and maybe I'm splitting hairs. But at the entrance there were some jugs of Lolo's own syrup. One was turned to where I could see the ingredients. Pure corn syrup with caramel color. To be fair, the jug doesn't say \"maple\" anywhere, but why try to fool people with caramel colored Karo? And I guess real maple syrup would cost a fortune. But hey, we paid 75 bucks for four people (without alcohol!) so what's a little more for real maple syrup?"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Gilbert location for our first time to Lo Lo's. We've heard great things about Phoenix and Socttsdale. We did not have a good experience at the Gilbert location.

The service was friendly but slow. In fact everything about this place was slow. Our food took a long time to come out. Meanwhile we had at least 4 different serving staff come by to 'check on us'. In addition to the hostess. The manager came by several (at least 4 times) asking if we were okay, how long had we been waiting, etc. To the point it was annoying. 

Meanwhile at three other tables, people stared into space, waiting, waiting and still waiting for their food. One couple got up and left without their food. The manager seemed upset that they left and went to the front area to talk to them. He was not friendly about the lack of responsiveness. 

Maybe the manager should be in the kitchen managing his staff and making sure there are competent cooks and that there are enough to meet the demands of the customers he seems so concerned about. 

We probably won't go back, because the food wasn't good, service was slow and overall not a great experience...especially when we paid $50 for two people. 

We are calling this Lo Lo's 'No-No's' or maybe So Slow...too bad. I hope they survive. Its in a great location."}
{"text":"I highly recommend them! Great food and the price is right. They have the right size dish for everyone, HUGE or small dishes. The staff is friendly, and the restaurant is laid back and casual. They have a fun theme, and drinks that fit the theme of the restaurant. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's has really grown to be well-known to Arizona with locations now at the airport and at Chase Field. Unfortunately this recent location in Gilbert is severely lacking and the owners need to address its many problems. I usually like to wait a few months till after a restaurant opens to make my opinion so that they can work out the kinks. You pull up any food app and all the reviews say the same thing - long wait or kitchen backed up. We were first met with all types of confusion at the hostess area. As you walk through the restaurant you can't help but notice that it feels very packed in. Our wait to be seated wasn't too long, but it did take close to ten minutes to be acknowledged by the server. Even though food took about 45 minutes, the server did tell us that the kitchen was very backed up (on a Thursday night). When we got the food, some of it was luke-warm and we didn't get our full order. So we had to wait another 15 minutes to get the rest of our order. No discount was offered but instead I got a very unsympathetic apology for the long wait. I love the food here, but I hope Lo-Lo's isn't expanding so quickly that they are forgetting about good customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in this afternoon for lunch the wait wasn't too bad maybe 25 min. Place was packed from opening recently and everyone is Vegas in on the hype of Lo Lo's chicken. Our waitress was quick and on point we ordered Lo Lo's chicken and waffle meal and the phat. Azz Samich the names are amusing at least. The sweet tea was insanely sweet . The fried chicken was burnt from old oil used the waffles were ok. My phat Azz Samich came out as fish when I ordered chicken. Wasn't anything special no good flavor or anything the fries were cold. I ordered banana pudding to go and let's just say it tasted like gross fake banana pudding from a store bought can wasn't impressed at all. Surely didn't look like the online menu I seen. A bill of $70.00 bucks including a tip surely wasn't worth it for the flavor less food. But we can now say we came and ate there, and don't need to go back. Oh and it says they have bread pudding on the online menu but apparently it doesn't exist here."}
{"text":"I was a little leery about coming here based on the yelp reviews but from what I read, I gathered that the food was good and the issues came from wait times or errors. My personal experience was excellent. 

Everyone on the staff anticipated our needs and it gets no better than that!! The hostess was sweet and offered a high chair for my son and gave a coloring sheet with crayons. She also asked what seating was best given that I had a child with me (on the way out she came from behind the podium to open the door). Our server was GREAT her name was Chevy and she was awesome from the minute we sat down. She offered an extra plate, extra butter, a kids cup and a drink to go. She even apologized for the wait of the food which did take a while even though it didn't seem like they were too busy. 

The only notable minor issue was that a leg that came with my chicken and waffles was under cooked and quickly another server noticed as she walked by. She grabbed a manager who was kind, complementary, and apologetic and immediately brought a new one. Easy peasy! 

I had at least 7 different people ask if I needed anything, tell me my son was cute or offer some sort of assistance. I was even watching tv and someone thought it was a cry for help lol That sort of service is why I tipped 50%.

As far as the food, it was good. The leg was meaty and not overly breaded, the breast was juicy (go ahead and smirk) and the thigh was cooked nicely as well. The waffles were thin yet flavorful and quite delish! A few bites kinda tasted like fried pork skins though which was odd but not worthy of a complaint. 

This place is on the opposite end of town for me but I had to run some errands and I'm really glad we stopped in. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"found my new place for chicken n waffles. had been hearing a lot of talk about this place so I decided to check it out. I definitely was not disappointed with the food or the service. PJ (server) was very friendly and courteous. The decor was nice and had a warm feel. I ordered the Tom Tom ( 3 chicken wings n waffle). I will definitely be back to try some of the other menu favorites. Oh I almost forgot to mention this place has Kool Aid."}
{"text":"Never going back.   Went weekday at 10:45 am and it took 10 minutes before a server showed up.   IT WAS NOT BUSY.  Requested a pitcher of Blue Moon Beer and waited.   And waited.  And Waited.   Finally, I went to the bar and asked the server for a pitcher; the waiter did not know how to \"ring one up\"   So he just ignored us.   So we waited another 5 minutes for the server to talk to a manager-type person.   There was some discussion, but still no drinks.   There were 6 people talking outside, a cashier AND a Hostess, but no one would wait on us.   After a few more minutes, the waiter  said this bar only had one pitcher.   We almost finished the pitcher and we were ready to order, but again, no server with 6 people milling outside and two more by the cash register.   I had to ask one of the girls at the register to get us a server.  She went outside where there a lot of people and the server came.    It only got worse; the server offered no condiments, there was only one pitcher in this restaurant, and he had to take the empty one and wash it and refill it.   Then I had to request fresh, iced glasses that come with a pitcher.   We got some apologies after shortcomings were pointed out, but that server and all the folks on that day shift need training.    I personally spent many years waitressing so I know what good service is and what bad service is.    We had been on errands and I was thirsty before we got there.    Never again"}
{"text":"I was really torn as to how to review , there wete a few things I liked but would I go back , never !! The waitress was nice but seriously , she never came back to check on our drinks , dirty plates left on table , the food took a ridiculous amount of time and considering they werent very busy it was quite annoying . There wete 4 of us and the food came all at different times , 2 of us got food then 2 of us just sat there. shrimp and grits was horrible in my opinion , chicken breast was ok , waffle was not memorable and they put cinnamon in their syrup ?? im not a cinnamon fan would just have appreciated a plain version , but our waitress was nowhere to be found so I couldnt even ask her if they had that. The chicken wings are not the chicken wings youre thinking of so fyi, my daughter got a burger said it was ok , just ok ?? im sorry if im spending $100 on a meal for 4 it better be better than just ok . wish we would have went somewhere else but at least but now we know"}
{"text":"Visited Lolo's three times now and I have never been disappointed. We had a wonderful waitress named Charmaine and she was so sweet, attentive, and helpful. The food is delicious and I recommend the chicken and waffles. Perhaps the chicken could use more flavor but that's a minimal issue. I believe they deserve more recognition, lol. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"The husband and I came on a Saturday night and probably the busiess time also. The wait for a table for us was 1 1/2 hours. We signed up for the text update on your phone for your table. We decided to walk around old town Gilbert and came upon the food trucks by the big water tower. There we had a quick snack. 
           We walked back to LoLos and waited about 20 minutes longer for our table. Overall it came to a 45 minute-ish wait time. We were sat outside for the table. The server came right over and got our drink orders: LoLos Punch and Orange Dreamcicle for $7 each. Drinks were good but hardly had any alcohol in them. 
           We both got southern style chicken and waffle combos. Chicken was very flavorful, juicy, and really really good breading. Don't understand people who said the chicken wasn't good. The waffles were also pretty good and thin. I happen to like thin waffles like that and could only eat half of the 2 waffle stack since having a full stomach from all the food!! Music was too loud, even for being outside. 
          I'm sure once the excitement of the restaurant being so \"New\" dies down it will be less chaotic and not as busy."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to take the kids to Lo-Lo's around 2:30PM on 2/22/15. We figured being mid afternoon there might not be a terribly long wait. We arrived and checked in at 2:57 and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. Okay, no problem.

We walked around the court yard for a while and enjoyed the weather. Well 50 minutes goes by and we don't get a text telling us our table is ready. We go up to the host station and they proceed to tell us there are 16 tables ahead of us and it would be another 45 minutes. WHAT?!? I started to get heated with the hostess when the lead hostess said it wouldn't be that long. So we sat down on the booth inside the door. 

30 minutes later we finally get a table. We asked for an inside table but the sat us outside. Oh well, we were starving by this time and said fine. It's now 4:45 PM and the sun is setting. The patio starts to get very cold and my sons, one of which has asthma and the other has a broken foot BTW, are freezing. We ask to have the heaters turned on. That took 30 minutes to happen. 

We order our drinks with one person. Another comes up and offers to take our drink order. WTF? We tell them we already ordered drinks and she says \"Okay, I can take your food order then\". We order fried pickles and our meals. It's now 5:05.  We get our drinks about 10 minutes later and the fried pickles arrive about 5 minutes after that. Not too bad on time.....then I try the pickles. While the flavor is okay, they were cold and soggy. Absolutely disgusting. 

So while we are sitting at our table, the temp keeps dropping and the wind kicks up and starts to make things very chilly. The heaters still aren't on at this time. I go in and find the manager and look around the restaurant and there are 3 empty tables. I asked the manager ,Maurice (I believe is his name), if we could move in doors because my kids were cold and my youngest has asthma. He basically told me tough shit that the tables inside were for guests who were coming in. 

I then looked at him and said do you think it would be too much trouble then to get our food that we have been waiting on for almost an hour? He looked at me like I was crazy and mumbled something and then walked off. So, here we are it's now 5:45 PM and still no food. I go to sit back down and notice an open table next to the heaters opened up. I asked our server if we could move to that table literally 5 feet away. He says I will have to ask. He goes and gets a Hostess. And she pretty much talks to me like I am an idiot for asking to move seats. She then asks \"Where did you want to move?\" I pointed to the table behind her and said \"Right There\" - Her Response was \"No we can't do that, you're just going to have to stay there\" WTF?!?!? What ever happened to the customer is right? Not at this place. 

About 10 minutes later our plates come out. My food is okay, nothing to write home about but it's tasty. The waffles are really good. My son's mac and cheese was cold and by cold I mean cold like it came out of the fridge. We hurriedly eat our food before it becomes ice cold and so that we could hurry up and leave.

We get done and after 10 more minutes of waiting I have to hunt down our waiter to get our check. 

This place is a joke. Maybe it's because they just opened but to treat customers like they do, I'd be amazed if they stay open for a year. Maybe it will get better. I'll never know because I will never set foot in that place or any other Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles again."}
{"text":"We were half way greeted. There was no one in the front greeting guests. It was like an oh it's 3 of you. Then someone came to seat us at the table. Again there was no hi how are you welcome xyz.But at least we were seated quickly. We ordered waffles and chicken of course what else would you order? The chicken was ok, it wasn't seasoned enough. The waffle had a decent flavor but I was expecting more. I didn't realize that when I asked for fresh lemonade, I was getting kool-aid but if that's your thing then you would have liked it  I was excited to try this place because I read asked article attempting to compare it to Roscoe's. Big mistake. Nothing like Roscoe's so don't get your hopes up too high. Overall decent meal, ok service, ok flavor so a 3 overall."}
{"text":"1 star for the initial experience. I missed work to spend the day with my family. We decided to try this place out. 

We got greeted and seated very nicely and fast. There wasn't really many people, but im going to assume because it was 2pm. After lunch and right before dinner.

We sat at 2:55pm. Took us about 10 minutes to decide. I ask the waitress what \"grits\" was and she said it was oatmeal. I then googled it.... not oatmeal. Anyways we ordered and waited...for a long time. The waitress made eye contact with us, asked if we needed more water. Not kool-aid, just water. We decided to leave at 350... because we just had waited too long. We didnt know it then but the waitress came and told us they were making our chicken extra chrispy, when im reality she had forgotten to put our order in.

We politely left... the staff and management went above and beyond to bring us back into the restaurant and make a positive experience. We ate for free, food is ok. But again the 1 star is for the fact that we're seated and forgotten about for an hour. I spent a total of 2 hours here, on a day i missed work to be with my family. Im thankful for the effort the management and staff put in after wards but i would most likely never go back."}
{"text":"Everything tasted great our server JT was amazing, great customer service very attentive to our needs and the food was delicious. That's why I rather drive all the way from Laveen to come here, because I never have an issue with the service or the food. Thank you guys"}
{"text":"This is my third time here, the food the first time was very good,?had no complaints. Second time was not hot and service was slow but the fried green tomatoes were sooooo good. My dad hated his food which it did lack flavor, seasoning. The third time was the other day on oct 27. To kick off my sisters birthday. I had salmon patties which were very good except that my patties had egg shells mixed in so I was constantly having to spit them out which was irritating. The greens were sooo spicy , it's was like they didn't know how to season them so they just made them hot. Which was weird because the greens are usually my fav. My mom got catfish fried and it was grey suggesting it was bruised or old before being fired and didn't really taste like anything, no flavor again. The canny sweets were really good as well as the corn bread. My little sister got southern fried chicken and it was hard and dry. U know like when chicken has been reheated and it gets that hard texture in the parts that overheated. It wasn't fresh at all! Had to been sitting under a heat lamp or reheated up or something for a while. Because u could look at it and tell it was not fresh . The server was really nice and service was average speed, not slow but not fast. I've gone to the Phoenix location and no one in my family liked it that much to go again , I've been to the Scottsdale location quite a bit and that must be their flagship because i can say that location I always good, only one thing I notice the stuffing/dressing had green bell peppers the first three times I had it and I loved it but recently I got it and they made it with red bell peppers and it was gross but I just don't get it anymore I get something else . Other than that the Scottsdale location is where we will go if we have a craving for soul food and my mom and sister and I are  all to lazy to cook lol"}
{"text":"It took almost an hour for us to get our food. One plate was cold and too salty, one the rice was not fully cooked, one was good.  Very disappointed,  will not return.  Bloody Mary was good.  Server was nice."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is in my top 3 best fried chicken ever. Moist and well seasoned.  Shrimp and Grits were great, some of the best fried shrimp I've had."}
{"text":"The chicken and waffles was cooked very good... I will definitely be coming back here many more times..."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now and seem to always get cheerful and sweet Brittany as a server. Unfortunately the wait for our food was inconsistent - ranging from a crazy 8 minutes at one visit to nearly an hour at another. I think the restaurant is still getting its groove and in this part of town inconsistent service and wait times seem to be the norm, sadly to say. 

My first visit here was the longest wait for food. I remarked to my husband and dining partner, \"this better be the best chicken and waffles I've ever had.\" AND IT WAS!!! The chicken was perfectly done, with a tasty and crispy coating outside and a juicy meaty inside. The waffles were perfect too - not at all soggy but slightly firm outside with a cake like texture inside. This dish is delicious! I get the \"DD\" which is the perfect amount of food to leave me satisfied and not over-indulging. 

I also love their Lolos punch which is Kool Aid, pineapple juice and vodka served in a mason jar - simple yet scrumptious and always ice cold. 

I am looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"We were told there was a 25 minute wait on a Saturday at 4pm. We decided to sit at the bar and avoid it. We noticed half the restaurant was empty, we weren't sure why the wait was that long to be seated. Anyway, we ordered our drinks first, they came quick and tasted great! Then we ordered. After placing the order I decided to change my mind immediately after ordering to a different entree I hadn't noticed, literally was less than a minute after we had finished placing it. The lady was nice about it and said she'd fix it. We waited about a half hour for the food, and when it came out it was completely wrong for the both of us. The runner and a different bartender were both confused and didn't say a word to us. 10 minutes later the bartender who took our order came over to us and apologized, saying that the fact I changed my order screwed everything up. A bit insulting but whatever... We then received our orders and they were correct. The food tasted great!!! Especially the Mac n cheese was on point!!! We asked for the check when we finished and they forgot to charge us for one of our entrees. We gave our cards for payment and they came back to us, saying they had given us the incorrect order on the receipt. The new receipt was completely incorrect and we were confused about that. We explained that wasn't our order and they became confused once again. 5 minutes later they came back to us with the correct receipt and apologized for the inconvenience. We signed the checks and left. The customer service could've been better in my opinion, but at least everything turned out correct in the end. The food tasted amazing, so we'll probably be back sometime. We definitely won't come here starving though."}
{"text":"If there was a no star I would do that waste of money and it was not good at all our first order came out super cold took the manager forever to come to our table then he asked us how long the food was sitting here lol I don't kno how long did it take u to come to our table? Horrible service chicken wasn't even good my sons mac and cheese was zero!! Then the manager came back out and gave us a tiny bowl of gravy? Maybe to compensate for the cold food? Idk I just don't recommend it waste of our money and time!!!"}
{"text":"I went with some friends and made the mistake of ordering french toast. The bottom was not cooked and tasted like raw egg. I asked for it to be replaced with waffles which turned out to be a bit floppy and not very tasty. I tried my wife's chicken and it was okay. I don't know why I would go back."}
{"text":"My family and I had brunch here last week. This location is just as delicious as the Phoenix location, but much closer to home. Our server was AMAZING, attentive and very funny."}
{"text":"The food was horrible. The chicken was breaded in sand (that's how it felt on my tongue), the waffles were too soft (almost like a pancake), they burned the grits so they ended up tasting like cigarette ashes, the eggs were okay, the burger wasn't memorable, the red velvets pancakes were okay, the macaroni and cheese was good, and the platter we had with fried tomatoes, fries green beans, and catch was the best thing we ate. 

The service was so bad. They forgot about our table after seating us and we had to ask a random server to take our order. Anything we needed to be done had to be directly asked for. I don't think I've ever experience worse customer service. 

The bill came out to over 100$ and I definitely feel like I wasted my money. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Lolo's for the first time and was disappointed. I ordered the chicken tender basket and was underwhelmed. I was pleased by the portions, however my chicken seemed more underdone on the outside than my two friends orders. When I got towards the middle I noticed it was not totally raw but was still pink on the inside, I wanted to inform someone but since it was so busy and I was sitting at the bar I couldn't find anyone to help me. The fries were delicious on the positive side and the music was popping, however I doubt I'll return."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time coming here.  Delicious food, nice staff, good value for your food.  The chicken is great.  Love the decor, gospel music, spacious place.  I had to get a mug, u should too.  The food is fresh and comes out in a timely manner.  This is the place u bring a group to.  Enough room for it.  Ample parking."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for breakfast and 5/5, especially their biscuits and gravy. It's a little on the pricier side but their portions are huge so it balances out. The staff i've come across so far have been nice, so no complaints here! Sometimes the service can be a little slow but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Way way way over priced! Food very average. Will not go back ever. Me wife and 7-year old bill was $73.00. Daughter ordered pancakes. I thought side pancakes maybe $5.00. No when bill came $13.00."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast at LoLos this morning with my wife. Not knowing if we would like the food we ordered one chicken and waffle platter. Came with 3 pieces of chicken and two big waffles. Food was good and one meal was plenty for two people. Butter and syrup accompanied the meal and service was great by a waitress memes Chevy.
Place is bright and clean with booths, tables and a full bar. 
They are in the old Tony Roma's location and have been open about 3 months.
Soul food is the specialty of the house and chicken and waffles are the main entree. Breakfast is served all day.
We will return to try dinner soon.
Always nice to be pleasantly surprised when you try a new place."}
{"text":"It's hood food, not soul food.  That said, if you're looking for hood food, and there is a place in this world for it, head down.  You'll love it.

  If you are more into soul food, you'll be able to deal...may even like.  But you will not fall in love with it.  Still, not a bad place to take the family or out of town guests."}
{"text":"I follow them on instagram and I couldn't wait to go. Every time we go to Vegas this is a stop that we must make during our vacation. My mother LOVES this place and she is super funny about where she eats. I had the double waffle meal (I forget the name) with my waggles extra golden crispy as I like it. They hit it spot on and my waffle was the best waffle I've ever eaten! 

The collard greens and those buttery cornbread muffins are great as well. 

This is a must stop for you when you come to Vegas. We will be back in August and will stop by as always."}
{"text":"After reading all the bad reviews, we were a tad worried but I've also heard great things about the Lo Lo's in Scottsdale. We have stopped by a few times since opening but the wait was so long we opted for one of the neighboring restaurants instead. 

Last night we decided to give them a try. Apparently midweek is the time to go, we were seated almost immediately. Unlike many of the other reviews, the service was good and the food came out promptly. We did notice lots of (what we assume we're managers) walking around asking how things are going. Based on the reviews, I can understand why they would be following up. A little pointer though - smile and be friendly when you ask. They were SO SERIOUS without even a hint of a smile which dampened the mood a bit. 

Now the food: the waffles were good with a definitive cinnamon taste. Not amazing but good and worth ordering if I was in a waffle mood. We both loved the fried green tomatoes. They had a lot of flavor and we didn't need the side of creamy sauce. There was a side of Mac n Cheese and some potatoes with a sauce (not sure of the name since I didn't order them). The Mac was very thick and cheesy. We liked it, especially with a little Lo Lo's sauce to give it a spicy kick. The potatoes were very good too. 

I'm glad I asked the waitress about boneless vs bone-in chicken. The boneless has a more bland seasoning (makes sense to have less seasoning for children) where the bone-in is more flavorful. I had the chicken breast and enjoyed it. I would've eaten then whole pice but my husband kept sneaking bites so I finally gave him the other half. 

Summation: definitely worth trying but might want to go on a slow night rather than the weekend until they find their flow and the crowds get smaller.

Final note: They do not, in any way, focus on healthy eating. It's fried, sauces and gravies food.  If you're looking for healthy options, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've visited the Scottsdale location a few years ago and swore I would not go back to another Lo Lo's however I decided to give the Gilbert location a try since everyone was raving about this new location. 

The service was great! Nick, our server was very attentive and refilled drinks on time. Granted, it wasn't very busy and many of the waiters stood around and acted busy. 

Food was brought out on time. Too fast, actually. The grits were not cheesy, nor savory and not worth the extra price. Collard greens was lacking the \"soul food\" flavor I was looking for and definitely not worth the $5. The chicken thighs were okay and the waffle a bit soggy. I think they over butter everything to make up for the lack in flavor. This place was a bit pricey. Spent about 46 dollars for two people to dine. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was good. Fresh. I think theyre better then Roscoes chicken and waffles which is like LoLos but located in Long Beach,Ca. I had the Lil Amad i think it was called. 2 fried thighs 2 waffles and a side of fries. The waitress talked me into getting pecans in my waffles and i actually love pecans but i didn't like the taste of it inside my waffles. The waitress and waiters were friendly. Oh their kool aid was really good, they serve it in a large mason jar. The restaurant was clean, bathroom was clean  they also have a bar inside. They are a bit pricey, we had a party of 3 and aside from ordering my side of fries a side of egg for my bros burger plate it came out to about $65 not including tip.   Oh and the waitress totally pointed out the preferred gratuity on the receipt. Um im not a bad tipper but don't tell me how much to tip you ok. Overall it was good food. Will prolly go back some time soon."}
{"text":"Really bright, clean atmosphere with super friendly staff. The food was great too! Unfortunately the service was very slow and unorganized. 

I'd go back again and give it another chance in hopes of better service."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Popeyes chicken is 10x better and that's sad. We went in there about 6 months ago on a super hot day and the place was boiling hot inside. I felt sick before even leaving and couldn't finish my food because I was sweating so bad. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was soooo bland and gross. Shrimp had absolutely no flavor besides maybe paprika or chili powder. Was also way over cooked on the breading. Second time, ordered sides and again they were bland and not good. With this place serving supposed soul food you'd expect an awesome flavorful meal. Not what you're gonna get here sadly."}
{"text":"It was good. It was a lot of food and could of share. The survivors was vary good.but my family went to the bathroom and seen a cockroach  but it was good be sides that"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because once the stupid fries arrived they tasted good (even though there was a BONE in them! )

We were here over an hour and all we ordered were fries! You've got to be kidding me! 

The server was so slow that eventually another server came over to assist us and the original server actually came over and quarreled with her at our table. Wtf? 

Oh no I would never recommend this place I'll never come back here again I would never wait over an hour for French fries the service was awful and after the meal we asked to speak with a manager who apologized and thanked us for the feedback and offered us dessert which we declined because we were SO OVER IT! 

They never should have even charged us. lesson learned."}
{"text":"Waited a little too long in my opinion today, once seated. The restaurant was practically empty. I got the #9. A breast, thigh, golden waffle and a side of Mac n Cheese. The chicken was hot and fresh! The waffle was fluffy and fresh! The Mac N Cheese was absolutely cold. Thus the 4 star rating. I didn't send it back because I was too hungry. Better luck next time!"}
{"text":"Being from LA, I went in with a clear mind... I was not there to compare them to Roscoe's at all but I will say I was impressed. I'd heard good things about the one in AZ so I was excited to know they were opening one here. The wait was to be expected and it didn't bother us at all. The food was hot and fresh. We had a party of about 6... the chicken was seasoned well, the waffles were tasty, the grits were nice & creamy and the kool aid was on point!!!! I'm gonna go back during lunch time and try a couple of the other menu items that caught my eye but all in all, good sh$%!!! Lol. I pray their longevity and success cause Lord knows, we can't seem to keep the good \"soul food\" restaurants around long."}
{"text":"Been to the Lo Lo's in Scottsdale and this location puts this one to shame. 
Today our (party of 2) lunch took two hours from start to finish. Took 10 minutes to get someone to take our drink order. Once we ordered our food it took about 45 minutes to get it. My plate (pork chops with egg and grits w/cheese) was good but I was missing my grits and told my waiter twice and never received them. My friend ordered biscuits and gravy and they sent hers to the wrong table and had to wait another 15 minutes for her food. And they forgot her eggs and didn't get them to her until she was done. Waited the rest of the time for my card to come back to me. If you come to this Lo Lo's expect your order to be wrong and to wait forever."}
{"text":"I'm really trying to love this place but every time I visit I get disappointed. This time food was excellent but service was awful. First we were greeted by a girl with 4 big \"love bites on her neck. Yuck!!! She seemed a little confused to find us a seat. She told us that she was told not to sit us in a booth because there was no service available in those areas. So we asked to sit in the bar area. She was very hesitant, and was reluctant, but she eventually sat us.

My observation was that their were 4 customers that were very unhappy with the customer service and their waitress, which left in the middle of her service. As for us, it took 15 minutes for a waitress to arrive and take our order. 

Although our waitress was nice, she seemed very overwhelmed. I was confused. There were 4 staff rolling utensils at a snails pace. Chatting on their phones, obviously having words and attitudes with each other. The bartender didn't move from his station. It was apparent that he did not have that many drink orders. I guess he has that \"I am busy, but not really busy routine down.\" It was also obvious he loved to flirt with the females. There was around 10 staff members hanging out in the bar area, but only 8 customers, and 1 waitress serving 3 tables.

Got a chance to check out the kitchen. Bingo now I know were are the waitresses are hanging out. It was like they were having a party. So I decided to go on the other side an count the customers. 15 customers in the other sitting area. There was more staff than customers No excuse for the bad customer service.In my opinion, it was obvious that the manager has no control over his employees. He was more a part of the problem than anything. When I can watch more employees walking out of the restaurants with containers of food and drink there are definitely issues. 

We watched how the manager handled the unhappy guest. He did a \"fly by apology\" He seemed more afraid of the customer. He discussed the error, gave a huge discount, and quickly walked away and dived back into the employee drama. Laughing, giggling, and avoiding serious issues with his staff. We finally received our food. Looked delicious but we had no utensils. The waitress that brought our food notice we had no utensils, she walked over to the group of utensil rollers. She picked up a set, then was quickly scolded by one of the staff for taking a set he rolled. So I watched her clean off our utensils and roll it in a napkin. Let me remind you, we are 2 tables away from this action. 

Our original waitress came back and apologize for all the drama. I just wanted my sweet tea refilled. I was so over the high school drama. I will go to LA to Roscoe's if I want really drama. By the way, the food tasted great!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a super rude bartender AKA THOMAS.. to bad for his poor attitude  the food was good and drinks were tasty .. we live about 1/8th mile from heritage marketplace and were excited to have lolos here .. not anymore we will just keep walking next time. .many other places to go that dont have rude bartenders...nice try maybe we will stop when we dont see him behind the bar ..."}
{"text":"Went today again for the second time wait forever can't make a reservation service was great had the same waitress she was excellent food is overpriced they close at six now not eat the owner came back that was there before so it's not a franchise I would not go back again it's not that great overpriced you have to wait too long you came and make a reservation not even open tables but I think their services outstanding from the waiter to the waitress everybody was so helpful except the wait time is ridiculous I would wait 40 minutes for to order to go they left people are leaving left and right he's gonna lose a lot of business he better wake up and see what's going on"}
{"text":"Food taste just as good as the other locations. I have only had the KK which is filling and won't leave you hungry.  It comes with three piece chicken, two tasty waffles, a side of grits and two eggs with cheese and onions. I prefer my eggs without the onions and order my sweet tea..half sweet and half unsweetened as it can be a potent concoction if was straight up. I would also like to see if there is a way to cook the eggs with less oil or butter?  At all the locations it seem there eggs come out overly grease.   Other than the 1hr wait for this location due to it recent opening (2days prior) this place has good potential."}
{"text":"Chicken was moist, tasted like home fried chicken, service a lil slow, waffles good, one of my biscuits with my sausage and biscuits were almost black on the top!  Might be minor but my bill came to 31.90, I gave 40.00 and got 8.00 back, it's the principle."}
{"text":"Get prepared for massive portions, but this place delivers a plate full of fried chicken with no equal.  I've had the DD for dinner and some omlette that huge at breakfast that I almost felt guilty about not eating enough.

Super nice staff too.  Enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"On Tuesday evening we went to have dinner here and it was 7:55 when got a table and sat down. We were meeting my sister and her sons here as they drove in from Cali on their way back home to NM. Originally we were going to dine at Lucille's BBQ in Tempe but this was their 1st choice so we we're set. On my way to this place I was thinking of the Mac n Cheese and cornbread. Something to indulge in after a long day. I ordered the soul food platter where you get your meat and a choice of 2 sides and a cornbread muffin. I ordered the Mac n Cheese & buttered corn. I was so hungry I was salivating at the mouth looking to satisfy my hunger with some Mac n Cheese & cornbread. After about 15-20 mins, our waiter comes out and says they're all out of Mac n Cheese. I was . He said the cooks aren't making anymore and to choose something else. I chose the whipped potatoes. When our food comes out, my country fried steak looked like it was heated up and folded. It was dry with no taste. I looked on my plate and seen that I don't have a cornbread but a biscuit. I asked our waiter I was supposed to receive a cornbread. He said they ran out and yet again they're not making anymore. My sis asked for anotjer item I don't recall what it was and they were out of that too. After the 3rd time I was . I understand we came in and got seated an hour before closing but an establishment as popular as LoLo's should know to make more than enough food for their patrons. Or, put up a sign or make it known to the servers to let customers know that certain items are out when they're one hour to closing. Don't get a person's hopes up thinking they're going to be satisfying their craving with some good ol' Mac n Cheese and cornbread. Let the servers know beforehand that these following items will likely not be available when it's one hour to closing. Or, let customers know were getting whatever is left. Heated items since the cooks say they are not making any more stuff when the sign says 9 PM is closing. I have never had a problem before with my food. My boyfriend on the other hand did where he was not satisfied and they fixed it then and there for him. It may have been in the morning but still. Regardless if it's morning, noon, or night it should not make a difference. We come to your restaurant for a reason and that is to eat some so good food that it make you want to slap your mama. This past Tuesday night was not the business. Very unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Cute place, we had heard good things and it was recommended by a co-worker.  

Sorely disappointed I have to admit, my friend had the chicken and waffles, the waffles were soggy and the chicken was cold.  He was really excited to see if the Chicken and Waffles were as good as Texas but they were not, he was pouty. :(

I ordered the Chicken fried steak, when it came it had this weird, brown gravy with red and green peppers - almost a Mexican flavor, NOT what I expected...I was expecting the white sausage gravy that every chicken fried steak I have ever had was served with...it was not good.  

It took forever to get our order and longer to get our check.  The service was ok, not great and the food didn't come out hot - maybe the server I don't know...unfortunately we will not be back. 

Sorry, LoLo's but you got a LoLo rating from me. :("}
{"text":"This is definitely not a place to write home to mama about. When we got there, there was a 30 minute wait which we didn't mind as that's usually a good sign of great food! I server was very uninterested in his job but was pretty attentive when my boyfriend got a cracked jar of water. I ended up ordering the 2 chicken leg 1 waffle plate with a side of grits and my dude ordered the 3 piece chicken and 2 waffle plate. It took quite awhile for our food to come out (30-40 minutes) but when it did it was hot and the chicken was juicy but it also lacked flavor. The waffles didn't taste like much until you drowned it in syrup and the grits were pretty bland as well. I wouldn't choose to come back but i would tag along if someone was dying to try this place."}
{"text":"Who eats breakfast at 11?! This place doesn't open till 11!!! Try other breakfast places nearby like the Farm House they are open at a normal time."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, my server was Morgan! And she was so bubbly and fun, the chicken and waffle combination is good and also lolo's hot sauce. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had the TayTay it was so good! Seasoned to perfection. The staff is personable and the atmosphere is great! I love Chandler!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but when I went they didn't have their liquor license  yet so I couldn't order any of the tasty looking drinks they had on their menu. Disappointed. I've had better southern style food but the atmosphere and staff were super nice."}
{"text":"Had Lo-Lo's for breakfast after church this morning and would give it 10 stars if I could. Our waitress, Faith,was AMAZING!! Best waitress I have ever had at any restaurant!! The bacon bloody Mary's will knock you on your butt and are delicious! Food, service, atmosphere and everything in between were great!"}
{"text":"Yo Mamma's Biscuits & Gravy was fantastic. It fills you up! I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"I wish they would open a location in the oc! We have no soul food. I will come out of my way to chk this spot every time in Vegas. So bomb!"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for almost 4 months and finally swung-in. My server was Amina she recommended fried pickles and I decided to try them as an appetizer! The server was very knowledgeable and friendly. They were great I also loved the waffles and fried chicken! 
The kool-aid was a nice addition! 
I felt the menu prices are a little too high. 
And the restroom could be nicer."}
{"text":"We went this past Saturday and there were around 30 people waiting outside. We were told there would be a 45 minute wait and it was accurate. They were extremely packed so the wait for the food was quite long but our waitress did come over and apologize for the wait. 

I ordered 2 drumsticks and a waffle ($7). The waffle was really good (a notch under Roscoe's) I would give it 8.5/10. The chicken was average at best. Maybe it was overcooked but the skin was quite rough. Overall I enjoyed it & will return. It's a good substitute for Roscoe's & will save us from driving to LA! Check them out!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The food was delicious, the service was on point, and we just loved everything! Our server was attentive and my 2 year old niece loved her waffle! Thanks to our server Nate, we will be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Lolo's. When we arrived it was a Saturday evening around 5pm and it was quite busy.  We were told it would be a 30 to 40 minute wait,  but we did not wait no where near that time.  We ordered the tropical Kool-aid which was refreshing. Our waitress was Windy, she was absolutely friendly and fast. She also made sure to check on us often.  Top notch service! The food was absolutely delicious and very authentic.  We can't wait to go back and share this Gem with the rest of our family."}
{"text":"I'm giving LoLo's a 3.5....I have been twice and each time was not disappointed. The chicken was hot, fresh & seasoned well... the waffles are not bad... I'm not a big waffle eater but they're ok. The wait may be a little long depending on when u go... Be mindful when u decide to pay them a visit. The Kool aid is on point...I like the watermelon and green apple. Although the service was slow the first time, we sat at the bar the second time and it was much faster. The staff was very friendly and attentive as possible though each time. Gotta go back and check out a couple more items now since their fill menu is avail and I can't wait until they full bar is available."}
{"text":"We gave them a 2nd chance and glad we did... Make sure you ask for Sparky! and tell him you heard good things about him on Yelp...Sparky made sure we had good a good experience this time and a perfect breakfast..we will be back.. Thanks Sparky!"}
{"text":"Went to Lo Lo's in Vegas yesterday and had the Carmel Banana Pancakes and sweet Tea for breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised as this place rivals Gladys Knight's Chicken and Waffles in Atlanta, GA"}
{"text":"I never had southern cooking before, and I am so glad I went here. Wow! The chicken is awesome and the grits were so filling, with a hint of spiciness. And those waffles, I really liked them! It is a good thing I walked five miles today; calories like that have to be worked off!"}
{"text":"Visited Easter morning early enough to,beat the crowd...patio sitting was great.  Breakfast was egg white omelet with spinach..etc..really good..chorizo and eggs..yummy..love their salsa....waffle sandwich with eggs and meat...good value...coffee was good..when we got refills...always had to ask...Waitress would disappear ...took while  to get requested ketchup..coffee and check...but we will return..."}
{"text":"It's disappointing when the food is great but the customer service is absolutely horrible! I work in the restaurant industry and I know that a guest should be greeted right away and should receive drinks promptly after. We had to remind our server THREE times for my boyfriend's drink. We received our food and still no drink. We grew impatient and grabbed another server's attention close by who looked bothered after we had asked her. I understand that it was busy, but we shouldn't have to wait over 15 minutes for a glass of water. Small details like this goes a long way, and unfortunately because of this we will not be returning."}
{"text":"When you have 5 people behind the counter greeting you and telling you it will be a 50 minute wait with at least 10-15 tables open you have a management problem. Oh well, I will try again another time."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and clean place. The peach vodka drink was delicious, but the food was pretty mediocre. I had the waffle and chicken tenders. The waffle was tasty, I like that they add cinnamon to them. The chicken was pretty gross though and didn't look fresh. Service was ok, I think our waitress forgot to put our order in and came to our table and blamed the wait on the kitchen being backed up (the table next to us came after us and got their food before us). 
Overall, 3/5 stars. Not a bad place, but I won't be rushing back the next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"Okay so I tried this place when they first opened and I promised myself I would never return. Recently I had a change of heart. I stopped in a few nights ago and order the Toy-Toy and I was definitely pleased ! The environment was really nice the music was my favorite! 90's R&B, if you haven't been here in a while I suggest you give them another shot! You won't be disappointed. Unless you compare them to their Arizona locations ;-) lol kidding"}
{"text":"I feel like this place has too much hype. Don't expect too much. The prices are a little high for breakfast plates [minus the grits special, that is only until 11am]. Don't try the pinapple upside down pancakes. I was really disappointed.  I'll stick to babystacks cafe for pancakes. The waffles smell good, but are very soft and mushy. I'd rather eat my chicken elsewhere..."}
{"text":"My wife and I were heading to Sweet Tomatoes when she mentioned that she would like to try Lo-Lo's. No time like the present, so we went there with kind of high expectations.

Things did not start well from the moment we walked in. It was about 3:30 PM and the place was clearly not very busy. We stood by the cashier's station with the sign to wait to be seated. And we stood there, and we stood there. Finally a young woman showed up and said she wasn't clocked in yet, but she would seat us and she did. She discovered that the cleared table wasn't wiped off. She got a cloth and wiped the table clean. She repeated that she wasn't on the clock yet, but someone would take care of us. That was the last service we got.

The room we were in had two other booths and one table occupied and one waiter who appeared to be responsible for the one table only, for he doted over that table, but never offered any service to anyone else. Another party was leaving as we entered.

As we were viewing the menu, a second young lady came to take our drink order. We each ordered tea and like magic, the waitress disappeared never to be seen again.

We settled on what we wanted using menus that apparently had never been wiped off and were sticky and waited for the teas and waitress to arrive. In the interim, another party of 4 was seated at a table. They were waited on by another waitress and received their drinks in short order.

And we waited, and we waited. The music was so loud that it was difficult to talk across the table and various employees would wander about with no apparent purpose, some even coming to the room entrance only to turn around and disappear and some wandered through the room as if lost. And we waited while employees appeared to play musical chairs through the room. It appeared to me that the employee's acted as if they were in a social club rather than a place of employment . . . you know, where you work for your employer.

Finally, we left in disgust. The woman cleaning the glass on the front door wished us a good day as we left. Her efforts would have been more profitable if she had she been waiting on customers.

We would have complained to management, but it was clear there wasn't any.

It seems clear that Lo-Lo's doesn't understand who is their competition. We walked across the parking lot to Sweet Tomatoes to eat a very pleasant lunch where the music wasn't blasting, everything was clean and the two of us ate for the price Lo-Lo's wanted for either one of us.

Time wasted, lesson learned. We won't be trying Lo-Lo's again."}
{"text":"The novelty for LoLo's is wearing off with the growth in the valley's options for food. This makes it hard to justify the high prices they charge for food. In a more diverse city you could get the same for half across the board with the same level of quality and taste. And actually a few places in the valley.  10 years ago this was among the few options for good soul food. Not the case anymore."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! Today was my first visit here, and it was love at first sight. Just the bright, upbeat feel instantly invites you in. I sat in the bar area tonight (New Years Day) and can't remember my server's name, but she was very attentive and joked around with us. If I remembered her name, I'd make sure to request her each time. I ordered fried catfish and a fried chicken breast with the fries and beans over rice. The beans over rice was so tasty that I'd willingly eat only that as my meal. The side of ranch I got with my fries was hands down the best ranch I've ever tasted. The hot sauce they have brought out the taste of the chicken. I'm pretty sure the catfish was corn meal breaded because it was so good I wanted to punch someone. God I seriously can't get over this place. My meal was $15, and it was so big that I have another full meals worth of leftovers. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I ate here the other day and I must say I thought a few things were pretty good. However, the portions were very large and that is wasteful. We had to leave food behind. Huge portions cause obesity! Also, service was good but the waiter misunderstood and gave me a side of a biscuit and gravy instead of just a side of gravy. Even though I explained this to him, he did not correct the check. The fried tomato appetizer was only 4 slices which was funny compared to price and the large entrees sizes."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken in Arizona. I went on opening day and there were some glitches, for sure, but I had no problem with that. It takes a few weeks for a restaurant to get up to speed, and I'm going to give Lolo's a pass because the food is so yummy.

They also have the brightest \"dranks\" in town! Go there and you'll see what I mean. 

This one's a keeper."}
{"text":"Lo Los chicken and waffles was great! Not only did I have such great service but the food was delicious! I didn't have to wait a long time and everyone was so helpful and nice. I will definitely be eating here again and telling all my friends about it. Thank you guys for being awesome!!"}
{"text":"The chicken here is very tasty, crispy and juicy. The waffles were decent and even though we ordered chicken and waffles, we had to ask our server to bring us syrup. The french fries were delicious. My only complaint was the service. We waited at least 15-20 minutes before a server came and asked us for our drink orders and by that time, we were already ready with our food order. I do have to give kudos to how fast our food came out right after we ordered, it probably only took about 5-10 minutes."}
{"text":"This was the dry eat chicken I've ever eaten!  I was thoroughly disappointed how bad the chicken was, it was always inedible.  And the waffles are underwhelming.  This place is not worth it in the least."}
{"text":"This is a great place for southern fried cooking. Probably the best fried green tomatoes I've had and the chicken tenders and waffles were wonderful also. Nice atmosphere but the music was a little loud."}
{"text":"Been there a few times and the best fried green tomatoes in town.  We always ask for our server; Raven...she rocks, great service, great food and the gin-n-juice isn't too bad either.  Best southern fried chicken in town!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Lo Lo's in Gilbert. I had a awesome experience. We didn't sit in this time. But actually called our order in. I love the walk up to go window. Our plates were good as well. And to top it off we got two extra pieces of Catfish. I will be coming back..."}
{"text":"I have never been more disrespected at an establishment. After sitting down my spouse and I waited 25 minutes to have our drink order taken. After ordering food our drinks were empty, we were never offered a refill or any acknowledgement to sitting there with an empty glass. After another 10 minutes I get my food but my spouse never received his food. Another 20 minutes go by with employees of the restaurant looking at him straight in the eye the server finally says something in regards to his food. She said that \"the cook was waiting for me to call out the order on the ticket.\" Which means purposely they ignored half of the ticket because I got my food and my food was on the same ticket. After another 15 minutes (he only ordered a sandwich and fries) still no offers on drink refills or updates on his food. Another 10 minutes, 5 bites into my food we left because of such poor service. I don't know if this was a racial thing because he was a white man with a camo hat on but come on. Everyone deserves equality. There was no excuse to be treated like this. But don't worry, we will never come to your establishment again. The only reason I'm rating one star is because there isn't a lower option!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my review isn't very different from the others. 

The fried chicken was really good and juicy. The gravy was delicious. The southern style Mac and cheese was good as well. 

The wait times are ridiculous!! I had read all the other complaints and I was hoping they'd get it together by now, but no!! We waited about 30 min for 3 dishes. I wasn't a fan of the cinnamon flavored waffle since I don't feel it goes with the chicken. I'm not sure if the bad service and disorganization is due to it being a new restaurant, but it needs improvement. Lastly, I ordered a side of rice with gravy and my white rice was hard like if it had been sitting out for a while. 

If I do return, I think I'll wait a few months or until I see the reviews improve."}
{"text":"Thought it would be a fun place for a birthday celebration? WRONG! 
When I mentioned we had a birthday at our table the waitress made sure she emphasized LoLo's does absolutely nothing for Birthdays?!? 
Disappointing so now the food took 35 minutes for simple chicken and waffles way too long of a wait for food that's fairly simple to prepare after all its what they specialize in. 
Food finally reaches the table, immediately I notice waffle is soggy not crispy or fluffy like you would expect from a place who specializes in Waffles also the chicken was drenched in grease had to send it back! Most likely why my waffle was soggy and inedible. LoLo's FAILED big time. 
Management walking around never once came to table to ask how our experience was but asked everyone else around us? 
Bad experience for birthday, too long of a wait, and food not meeting basic quality expectations. Overpriced for the quality of service and food we got.  
Not sure what they specialize in? Everything we had seemed Half A$$!
*Be warned you will most likely leave dissatisfied/disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time about a week ago and absolutely loved the place. The food and service were great and I knew I'd be back. However, my experience this week was a nightmare. The wait to be seated was shorter than expected for the lunch hour, about 15-20 minutes. Once seated it was 15+ minutes before anyone took my drink order and that was only AFTER I went and notified the hostess I was still waiting. My server (props to her, Misty, she was awesome) came and apologized and explained she had several tables inside and no one informed her that they had sat customers in her section outside. She took my order and went about her business checking on our party multiple times. Misty explained that the kitchen was slightly backed up because they had gone to the full menu this week and the kitchen couldn't keep up. After about 30-45 minutes of waiting for our meal, I asked Misty to bring me the manager...all of them, because this was ridiculous. The manager, pleasant lady named Barbara-jean came and apologized and restated what Misty had said multiple times, and that she would personally go check on our meal. About 10 minutes later the food arrives, waffles so cold the butter wasn't melting and the chicken, apparently, had been fried for an hour...YESTERDAY! It was burned beyond recognition and no where near edible. I was promptly brought \"fresh\" chicken and guess what, a piece of it was worse than the first plate. I get new restaurants have their issues but what happened here goes beyond unacceptable! I'll give them one more shot maybe in about a month, if they are still in business, but only because of the way Misty and Barbara-jean handled things, and memories of my first visit."}
{"text":"I've been to the Phoenix location several times - it has been great. This Gilbert location was not good - food, service, wait time, etc. It ruined our day because this was the first time I was taking my mother and father there. 

Good points - appetizers came out hot and fast; gizzards are still awesome!

We waited a VERY long time for our food. We asked our server because we noticed that we ordered before other tables that were getting their food. First she said that she checked, and actually the other table's ticket went in before ours. Then after another LONG while, she said it was because we ordered food other than chicken, which is made constantly. Two different excuses equals bad kitchen management and bad expediting.

Our food finally came out. The chicken we did order came out warmish and dry as a bone. Made fresh constantly our server said, and still our was old. So I told her \"This is made fresh - I don't think so.\" Then she brought out more chicken which was amazingly hot and juicy...but lacked any flavor whatsoever. I ate my collared greens and mac n' cheese - not a g good lunch :(

My father couldn't even eat his red velvet pancakes because they came out soooooooo dry. He sent them back and didn't even both to get anything else.

The kool aid was also nasty - I think somebody was shoveling the powder mix into the glass - it was undrinkable. So I got water instead. Too bad our server wasn't around to refill it very often. She wouldn't bring me a pitcher of water either!! Why not?!

I don't know if it is just this location, or if Lolo's is going downhill in general, but I will DEFINITELY NOT be back to this location. As far as I'm concerned, they owe me my lunch tab back. What a rip-off!!!!"}
{"text":"I agree with previous reviews that this place doesn't have its act together.  We had gone to Lolo's in Phoenix and we're excited when one in Gilbert opened up since it was way closer. We had stopped at this location the week before but was informed that it was an hour and a half wait which seemed crazy so we left.

We came back this weekend and was told  a 20-30 minute wait, much better. We were seated after 40 minutes, a little behind but not too bad.

Our waitress was over fairly quickly and we both ordered lemonade. When the drinks came we ordered right away. We stuck to the classics, Lolo's Chicken and Waffles for the both of us. And then we waited. We watched as a table that was seated after us got food, ate and left and our waitress was nowhere to be found. About 40 minutes after ordering food our waitress stopped by to let us know our food was coming up shortly.

After another 30 minutes the waitress in the section next to us, Gabbie, noticed that we had been sitting at our table without service for quite awhile and asked if everything was alright. After explaining the situation she said she would get our food right away. A few minutes later she came back with our food.

After Gabbie had left our waitress came over and was very rude and confrontational about the fact that we complained about the long wait time and poor service.

The food itself was okay for the most part, though the chicken breast was quite dry. It definitely wasn't worth the wait and horrible service. The only saving grace about the entire experience was Gabbie."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit to Lolo's. First visit was fantastic about a year ago. Decided to check it out again thinking more bang for our buck. Well, waitress Deonna was great. She let us know that the grits would take 9 mins and we could pick a side. I ordered the lil C, Which comes with grits  And 2 pieces of chicken I got a leg and if I my husband ordered the waffles eggs and grits. So the sides that we ordered was the red beans and rice and I got the smothered potatoes which they were in small side bowls. Chicken was lukewarm when we got it but it was tasty and had great flavor. We were expecting the grits but had to ask for them. Grits come in a container that is barely 1/2 full. It was supposed to be both orders. Icing on my cake, asked for manager who never came out to talk to us. Cook tried to make up for it with a fuller container of grits and a few pieces of fresh chicken. Am I going back? Probably not. Just curious, if he made fresh grits, gave me two tablespoons of it, who were the rest of the grits for? Oh btw, grits were runny watery and probably will taste like shit. Never again Lolo's, never again. Save your money and go to M&M soul food. At least I will get a full order the first time."}
{"text":"Was very surprised how delicious this place is.  You can really tell they cook the food with love which is rare nowadays.  Server Kiki was chill and tentative.  The atmosphere is laid back (we loved the music) and the bloody bacon mary was delicious.  We all literally felt like sloths when we left because we were just ready to nap because it was so damn good will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Super Slow and non-existent service. Food not that good for the bad service!"}
{"text":"Decent place to go for southern comfort foods. I don't eat chicken but it definitely brings the crowd. I ordered grits, eggs, waffles and Mac and cheese. Yea you can judge me but I wanted ok? The grits are pretty standard, nothing to rave about. Eggs were seasoned well but the waffles are definitely softer than expected. They take on a pancake type fluffiness with a hint of cinnamon. I would order them again now that I know not to expect crispy. I tried my wife's catfish which was good also. I really wanted some baked Mac and cheese but it is stovetop with a cheesy sauce type thing going on. Not my favorite but OKish. Make sure you ask for the drink happy hour price because they may not mention it. Prepare to wait a bit on your food."}
{"text":"From the LA area and have tried multiple places that serve chicken and waffles, this place was good and different then what i am used to ordering. Their gravy for the chicken was a red sauce like and had lots of flavors, chicken was cooked well. Waffles came out perfect and not soggy! thats a plus!"}
{"text":"The hosts were kind of distracted and not as welcoming as I'd expect, but the server was attentive and gracious. We had chicken breasts that were HUMONGOUS and crispy, thick Mac N cheese, and nice thick waffles. The sweet tea was also delicious. I'm very impressed by the food and cleanliness, and I will be back."}
{"text":"We went Saturday night at 7 and had a 30 minute wait. It was busy. We ordered the Shrimp and Grits and Chicken and waffles (#3, I think it was LoLo) and a side of fried Green tomatoes. The fried chicken was very good, the other food was just ok at best. The Shrimp and Grits were a bit bland. The waffle was soggy and not hot. The fried green tomatoes came with our entree. Our food came and we had to ask for silverware and syrup and waited longer than we should have to get it. The staff is friendly but there is no sense of urgency. Service needs improvement, there is a lack of attention to details like the silverware and syrup. We might try it again, but we would only get chicken."}
{"text":"We decided to try out Lo-Lo's last night.  Got there around 5:15- there was a 45 minute wait so we sat at the bar out on the patio instead of waiting for a table.  We were facing the kitchen door.
The minute we sat down, the couple at the bar stools next to us ordered their dinner.
They didn't receive their food for a good hour and a half.  They only ordered fried green beans and a waffle with chicken.  When they finally did receive their food they didn't get it all at once- they called the manager over to complain and he basically told them, we have only been open for a week, we are training our staff, and basically TOUGH LUCK.  He actually said, \"I hope you will come back, but if you don't like it, don't come back.\"
We should have gotten a clue then but we had ordered our food around 10 minutes earlier.  We started paying attention to the door to the kitchen.  There was a lot of server foot traffic but no food was coming out the door!  We also started paying attention to the servers at tables around us and they all had the same line- I am sorry, we have only been open a week- it will be another 15 or 20 minutes for your order.

Our food was finally delivered about 90 minutes after we ordered- one order was a waffle with 2 chicken thighs and the other was The Backwoods- chicken gizzards with rice and gravy.  The Backwoods was stone cold, as was the waffle.  Luckily, they serve their syrup warm.  I satirically asked our waitress to see if they couldn't at least stick the Backwoods in the microwave so I could it at least have it warm.  She ran it back to the kitchen and in 2 minutes back it came.... the same dish, straight from the microwave.  Ugh.  The 2 chicken thighs were big, and were mostly chicken ribs.  They had virtually no meat on them- all bone.

Overall, a huge disappointment.  Our server (the bartender) did the best she could with what little she had to work with.  If you are looking for a nice meal in downtown Gilbert this should be your last choice."}
{"text":"I am sure that the waitress forgot about us. Manager had to come and offer free food since my order couldn't be completed. After an hour wait for food that I wasn't received. I got 4 pieces of chicken for free that was delicious. Food was good"}
{"text":"Just had an awesome chicken and waffles lunch here. Great service and food. No complaints... All good."}
{"text":"We were going to go to a place nearby but I saw this as we drove by and had to try it.
Inside decor was pleasant and clean. Nice outdoor patio. I was looking at the bad reviews about this place before I ordered, so my expectations were not that high.
I had the Lil Amadi, that is one waffle and two thighs. The chicken was fantastic ! Hot and juicy but not greasy. The waffles are thinner than the traditional Belgian waffle, which works well, I think. Served with a nice melty blob of butter on top and warm syrup on the side. My waffle had the flavor of cinnamon.I asked the server if all the waffles were cinnamon flavored and she did not think any of them were......
My wife had a bowl of grits with a thigh and drumstick. She thought the grits were some of the best she has had. The chicken she also gave a thumbs up ! Both of our selections were very reasonably priced. I would have given this place 5 stars based on this one visit, except for the server. She did not seem to know much about the menu. 
I wish we had a Lo-Lo's in MN ! I like a place that serves breakfast all day.
They are new and I think many of the bad reviews are a reflection of that.
Give them a try."}
{"text":"4 because service is always slow. But food  deserves 10 stars!  Chicken is delicious , fish is fried perfectly. Love the salmon croquettes. Sides are wonderful and corn bread is the best."}
{"text":"Decent at best, waffles do not taste as good before, customer service is blah at best. So much potential to be a great restaurant but never did. Hope they improve tremendously but every time I go, it gets worse and worse"}
{"text":"Place is awesome and the prices are even better! Every time I go to a soul food or chicken and waffle joint, they charge an arm and a leg. Not this place. I would consider this place cheap but the food is definitely worth more. For 2 waffles, 3 piece, grits and cheese eggs, all for $15. That fed me and my daughter! Their \"dranks\" is great. Kool-aid, c'mon I don't need to say more. My daughter is only 2 but she love their fried chicken and the waffles even more. Rosa was our server and she was great. Treated my daughter like family. She even held her and showed her to work the register. Rosa is amazing! You can definitely count me as a regular after today."}
{"text":"A chicken and waffle place? Based out of Arizona? I know what you're thinking. \"Dont knock it til you try it\" right? 

So I come in on a thursday night about 7:15. Place was not all that busy but enough for the the staff to stay busy. We got a table right away which should be expected for the restaurant was only half full.

As I go over the menu I see that a lot of the food names are in relation to \"Da Hood\". Things like Baby Ray, Betty's Boob, and Tre-Tre's. That's for the chicken choices. I find it funny because when you're in \"Da Hood\", good food usually does not cost an arm and a leg. And it tastes good. What im saying is the food here does not taste good at all. Compared to Roscoe's Lo Lo's chicken does not have as much flavor.

So what I got was the Sheeda's Special ($11) and Fried Okra ($4) and Home Fries ($4). The Sheeda's Special was a chicken breast and wing along with a waffle. The chicken was bland and extra greasy, like they were in a hurry to serve it and didnt really give it enough time for the grease to drain properly. The waffle was plain bad. It was soggy and you can taste some cinnamon mixed into it. Putting a lot of syrup on it almost made it taste ok. Since thats all you get for the Sheeda's Special, I opted to get a the side of fried okra and home fries. The okra was soggy and literally had grease dripping from it. I guess it was the same person who pulled it out of the fryer and didnt give it enough time to drain? The fried okra at Dickey's barbeque was way better. The home fries were tasteless. The only thing I could taste was the onions and green peppers that were cooked with it. The potatoes were dry.

Service was almost non existent. I think I only interacted with my server twice. Once for taking the my order and then the second time bringing out my food. I take that back. Actually 3 times but the 3rd time didnt really count. The iced tea that she gave me literally looked like mud. I took a sip and I swear I could taste tea grounds. So I had her change it out for a diet soda.

Some things I wanna mention. One of the servers there look like they could be a Jonas brother. Only this guy was cut. You guys should take a pic with him and say he was helping out at Lo Lo's that day. After I ordered I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and they were out of paper towels so I mentioned it to one of the servers. After we got done eating about an hour later, I went to wash my hands again and STILL no paper towels. Fail.

Overall, this place is way overpriced, overhyped, and the service is terrible. I am definitely not coming back. On a side note if you want really good chicken and fried catfish, go check out Sunny's Chicken and Fish over towards North Las Vegas off of Lamb and Washington. You can get a 2 piece breast and wing with waffle for $3.99! For the price of a Sheeda's Special you can almost get 3 orders at Sunny's! His chicken and fried catfish taste way better and it is what I use to compare other chicken/waffle/catfish places! Plus the location is actually in a \"hood\" part of town so Lo Lo's got nuthin on this place! Sunny's is probably the best kept secret in regards to great chicken and catfish. If you go, tell him Roger sent you! Matter of fact, I had to go there the very next day just to get over the bad experience at Lo Lo's! I dont usually mention other restaurants in my reviews but in this case I feel bad that you guys are missing out if you havnt been to Sunny's! Plus your wallet will thank you!

Yelp 2016 Review #18 \"Just say no no to Lo Lo's Chicken\"
591 overall"}
{"text":"The food and the service has been great every time. We take all of our out of town guests here and everyone has loved it! The chicken and waffles, salads and sweet tea have become our favorites. The drink selections are also great as well."}
{"text":"Overall, I was underwhelmed. I ordered the LoLo's 3 piece chicken and waffles. If \"chicken and waffles\" is in the name of the restaurant, then it better be the best darn chicken and waffles ever! Sadly, it was the not. The 3 piece was an assortment - drumstick, thigh, and wing. All the pieces where cooked inconsistently. Mostly my impression was dry - the chicken was definitely overcooked. The waffle also did not knock my socks off. Just plain, nothing special, a little soggy. 
I also sampled the cornbread - again not impressed. Dry and lacking flavor. 
Husband ordered the catfish - doesn't seem fresh. For a lack of better description, it had an overly fishy taste and odor. Hard to get over. Won't be ordering that again. 

Also, I hate commenting about service because it just varies with every visit and depends on which waitstaff you get - but this place needs some help. We got seated in the bar area (which we did not choose, the hostess put us there) and there was only one waitress working the entire bar and covering the tables. Who made that call? She was seriously over-extended and unfortunately that meant no service for us. Never got an offer for drink refills (I had to flag down the manager to get this accomplished). And after the food was hastily dropped off, no one came by to check on us once. I pointed out again to the manager how no one was helping us and she did nothing (I also overheard the table next to us making the same complaint to the manager). Nothing was done to correct the situation- the manager just simply made the excuse of servers calling in or showing up late. It's your job to manage the staff and fill in if needed. So bottom line - won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great soul food, great people. Love the fried green tomato and the sauce . Lemonade is the bomb. Deep fried catfish was great, chicken was a little dry but good flavor. They have good hot sauce and house gravy."}
{"text":"My lady and I ate here at our stay in Vegas and this restaurant is full of the Southern hospitality that I'm use to with me being from Atlanta, GA. The food was terrific and the spiked cool-Aid was definitely amazing when you love to drink like me. I had the chicken and waffles and it was so good. The best waffle I ever tasted. The service was great too and they made sure we were well fed and welcomed and I loved this place"}
{"text":"Worst experience.   My daughter recommended Lolos Chicken and Waffle so on Friday 04/06/18 around 7pm we arrived and it was 2 adults and 3 kids.  The hostess was acting as a hostess/busser.  Then it took 20 minutes for someone to come to the table and ask us what we would like.  Since we had some time we decided to order an appetizer and order our food at the same time.   Appetizer came out fine however, our food was another story.  It took over an hour for the dinner to arrive.   While waiting I took my 2 granddaughters to the restroom and when I came back my daughter said they came and packed the leftover appetizer and were ready to give her the check.   She is like wait a minute we haven't received our food. And the waitress seemed confused.  Mind you we ordered Mac and cheese. Grilled cheese fried fish pancakes and biscuits and gravy. Simple meal.  Then an another lady came out and brought our food and we asked if they forgot our order and she did not apologize or seem to care.       I paid for the full meal.  Would I recommend this restaurant to family friends and coworkers.    No, I would not!!!   25 years of the restaurant and hospitality business.     It seemed like everyone there were all over the place with no direction."}
{"text":"Seriously the best chicken and waffles since Waffle House! I'm mean the chicken was super moist, flavorful and extra crispy !! Lemonade was bomb and mac and cheese was great!! I'm in heaven! I'm
Coming back Sunday! The crowd will be huge and so will my stomach!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome food, great atmosphere, great staff! Loved the items on the menu (item names are especially fun), plenty of options for seating (patio, bar/booths with TVs in view, normal seating). A very good time. Busy - but that's what should be expected of really good restaurants. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Probably won't ever go back here. Management is basically oblivious to the lack of customer service here. Sat in the booth for 20min before getting just the drink order taken. Thank god for KIERA who came over after she noticed the manager wasn't effective in sending the person assigned to our section over. There were so many employees on the other side of this restaurant standing around not doing anything. KIERA should be promoted to manager, she is fast, polite, and knows how problem solve instead of making shift change excuses which is what management did. Didn't know a shift change took 30min."}
{"text":"When we came in there were 6+ empty dirty tables they stayed dirty the whole time we were there. Our service was ok, the food was ok I had to ask for Tatar sauce with my fish and chips should be a given or at  least asked. No refills on drinks. Lots of servers running around not seeming to know what the hell they are doing. Not thinking we will be back just not worth it better food and service around....."}
{"text":"I love fried chicken. I love waffles. What could go wrong?  Well when the waffle is thin and bland. And when the chicken is kinda dry and bland it's a bad combination. First time here and I was impressed by the decor and style of the place. I could be wrong, but it feels like they took over a place that went out of business or something because it seems a mismatch for a chicken and waffle place.  But was nice environment anyways. I don't think they will be around long with mediocre food."}
{"text":"Once again I'm in the area for work and was told this was the place to go for soul food (specifically chicken and waffles ). I ordered the fried catfish ( I know. I didn't order the famous chicken), one waffle, a side of mac and cheese, an Arnold Palmer  ( with sweet tea that's important ) and banana pudding for dessert.  The catfish and waffle were very good. I like my catfish fried crispy and Lo Lo's came through with it. I wasn't a fan of the mac and the waitress was kind enough to take it off my bill and even offered a replacement side. I opted not to get another side because I was full and wanted to leave room for dessert.  I haven't tried the banana pudding yet but it looked good. 

The service was excellent!  I am definitely planning to eat here again before I leave town."}
{"text":"You might not be able to find cheaper chicken and waffles in town. Their menu has a whole page devoted to different variations of the dish, based on the amount and type of chicken and number of waffles. I went with the Lil Amadi at the super low price of $7, consisting of one thigh, one drumstick, and one waffle. The chicken was better than expected with a crunchy, crisp exterior and well seasoned, tender meat underneath. The cinnamon in the waffle was noticeable right away. I could smell it as the plate was being set down in front of me. Thin, with edges slightly crispy, but the overall texture was one of a soft, pliable, chewy waffle. A warm dispenser of maple syrup was provided too. Not a bad meal at all, but far from the top notch versions found elsewhere around town.

One order of cornbread is fairly massive. It's a large muffin topped with a scoop of butter. The bottom and outside edges were firm, while the inside was moist and quite chewy with bits of corn worked in.

The service at the bar was great -- friendly and attentive. The selection of beer, on the other hand, was pretty sad. Beers on tap included Bud, Bud light, a cider and something that was like Busch light. It would have been nice if they could get some local brews for their taps instead. 

This place may not offer the best southern food around, but the price and portion sizes are strong reasons to pay this place a visit."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and waffles.  \"Excellent\" is an understatement.  Great tasting food and excellent service"}
{"text":"An amazing breakfast. We had a variety of pancakes and eggs. Please! both us and our children. Our server Lorenzo had great recommendations. He was also amazingly attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Restaurant looks a little fancier than I expected. Although busy, service was great and the food was very good. It was the first time I tried chicken and waffles and I liked it. My only criticism would be the grits. Having lived in SC for over a year, I know what delicious grits taste like. Those fell short of that. Other than that everything else tasted very good. The sweet tea needs to be just a teeny bit less sweet. I was surprised that while I ate fried chicken and waffles and eggs, etc I left the restaurant feeling full but not heavy, I like that! Will be going back to try more options as their menu is filled with delicious sounding food."}
{"text":"I went with the signature Chicken and Waffles dish and it did not disappoint! The chicken was a bit dry and under-seasoned but the waffles were amazing with great maple flavor! Quite a bit for your buck and I am looking forward to going back and ordering other items from the menu very soon!"}
{"text":"Well lets start here with this review.

$9 for a beer.........ridiculous. 

Now I ordered the 2 chicken breasts and waffle.
The chicken was GREAT, loved every bite. The waffle? It was a waffle, No big deal on that. The combination, I don't get and wouldn't order again. I think you have to stop here at least once, but to get me back someone will have to buy me dinner."}
{"text":"First visit to Lolo's (certainly not the last) and it was delish.  I had the combo with one piece of chicken and one piece of catfish, with greens and Mac n cheese ( it comes with a corn muffin)......very good.....huge portions.....you'll likely need a go box

The service was a little slow but we weren't in a rush, so no big deal....they make everything fresh.  The food was very fresh and HOT.  I'm not sure what it would be like during very busy time of day, we were there just before two in the afternoon."}
{"text":"So give this place a second try...I'm on my third. Why? Great service! Who? The bartender, Tenikia.  My 2nd morning coming in after work for a yummy mimosa and eggs. She is good, floating like a butterfly, busy as a bee and smiling along the way. No more young, absent minded staff here. Why did I try after first attempt? Limited options for breakfast near me, and I'm southern, grits. Their grits need, butter, hot sauce, s&p, and then good. Biscuits are amazing! Only honey or molasass could make them better."}
{"text":"I just want to say we had horrible service. 

My girlfriend and I walked in very excited to try the food out, but as we walked in the party of 4 in front of us was waiting for 15 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was not busy at the moment and I couldn't understand why they were waiting so long. 

When they were finally seated, the host didn't acknowledge we were standing in the lobby area waiting to be seated as well. She walked away from her post and never came back for another 10 minutes.

I'm usually very patient, but after listening to many complaints of the people waiting I asked the waitress at the bar if we could sit at one of the empty booths. To my demise, she said we had to wait to be seated. There were only 5 tables in the bar area being waited on. I didn't understand why we couldn't sit there. So we waited another 5 minutes and the host finally came back. 

When she cane back we said it was for a party of 2. As she was about to seat us she forgot she had to bring the uber eats driver his delivery and went to the kitchen to get it. 

At this point I was frustrated and we walked out just like the other groups in front of us who did not have as much patience as we did. We didn't even get to try the food. 

This was very disappointing and I do hope one day we can try this place out. If this service keeps up I don't think this restaurant will survive."}
{"text":"Just finished my second visit to LO-LO's and I gotta give 'em some LOVE! I walked up to the take-out window for a 2-piece with beans&rice. 6pm on a Tuesday, the place was maybe 1/2 full....but they took my order in about 2mins. I went to the bar to have a whiskey and watch some NBA playoff basketball in beautiful HD while I waited. My food came in about 5mins...so perfect!! This is a fun, lively, interactive restaurant experience with good-looking people working and dining inside and out. The chicken has been moist and tasty on both my trips here (don't ask me about the waffles- I don't eat waffles.) Great location that I really hope lasts for the long term. I"}
{"text":"My wife and I got there at 12 noon today for lunch. We walked in and the place was half empty. The hostess told us it was a 20 minutes wait. When we asked why it was 20 minutes she said the kitchen had to catch up. Huh??? If they cant accommodate a half full restaurant at noon is this really a place you want to go. We passed and went to another restaurant that wanted to serve us."}
{"text":"Five stars because never had a bad experience. Food is always great and out fast. Love the waffles and chicken. I'm stuck on that. Highly recommend this place. You want chicken. This is a great spot."}
{"text":"I'm glad we waited a few months before finally checking this place out. From numerous Yelp reviews and many of my friends experiences, this place has non-existent customer service skills with long waits!

Came on a Saturday day about 12:00pm and there was a crowd outside waiting to be seated but we went straight to the bar and sat right away. I was told before they didn't have an alcohol license but thank god when we went they finally had it. Ordered a Melon Mojito, hey it's 5:00 somewhere right? It was pretty good. 

Got our orders right away. I ordered a \"Baby C\" which had your choice of two thighs or two drum sticks with either grits or fries. I decided on the grits added some cheese on top which I really didn't like. The chicken was good tho, really juicy. The beau got waffles so I had some of his and it really did taste like the Infamous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. 

We also got one of their popular items, Spicy Corn Fritters and everyone who walks through that door needs to try this! It's one of the best things I have ever eaten. The dipping sauce that comes with it just compliments it so much. 

The bartenders were very accommodating. They didn't take long to take our order and bring our orders out. I did see the workers get a little snippy with each other but other than that customer service was not bad."}
{"text":"Lo Lo's was Bomb I got the fried chicken and waffle OMG!!! Very very good and our waitress gave us diffent mixes for kool aid. Very nice portions I had my left overs for dinner later that night . I will be coming back next time where in Vegas"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time eating at lo-lo's but it will not be my last. I came during happy hour the drinks were great. The server at the bar was very helpful and nice. Our waiter was Bradley and he was very informative on the food & drinks. I was skeptical on eating here since I am used to Roscoe's chicken and waffles, but I will say when it comes to the size of lo-lo's chicken their chicken is a bigger size. The Mac & cheese and their rice and beans were tasty. I have already recommended this location to a friend and will continue to suggest this restaurant. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Went on a Saturday evening, between 1:00 to 2:00. pm.  Light crowd. Ordered the cod fish and chip.

Initially when my food came out I only had 1 piece of fish.  Got the second piece of fish after asking about only getting one.

My wife ordered chicken and fries, all dark meat.  After waiting about 30 minutes for our food, the waiter said they didn't have any dark meat ready and asked if she'd like to substitute for another meat, or can wait another 30 minutes for another batch to come out.

Of course I had to hit the restroom before heading out.  Noticed a few things in the men's restroom that stood out.  There was only 1 urinal and 1 stall, but had room for a 2nd urinal.  The stall didn't have any toilet seat covers loaded into the holder (wasn't empty, just didn't have any loaded at all).  Lastly, under the sink had a cabinet tha contained cleaning items.  That's fine, but maybe the list of items should be posted inside the cabinet.

Would I come back here again?  Probably not this location, would rather just wait and get it at the ballpark."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing experience. The waitress seemed impatient and wasn't very friendly. The manager came by and sort of awkwardly asked us to leave a tip? It was strange. The chicken and waffles were subpar at best. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and certainly would not eat here again."}
{"text":"This is our second visit and it was mediocre both times. To be under new management it still needs some work. 
We were seated and given menu's and finally asked for our drink orders. Speed is not their best attribute.  We waited an unusual amount of time for our waiter, but once Steve arrived the ball began to roll a bit.  He was very pleasant and took our order. The biggest issue was the amount of time we waited for refills on our drinks.  The chicken was a bit on the dry side and very small portion for a single breast for 4.00 each.
Not a place we would go out of our way to patronize again.
We originally went for Country Fried Steak and Gravy but they no longer have that on the menu (was scratched out with black marker) and we were told that they are trying to be more like the Arizona location? Why fix what isn't broken? Not our idea of Southern Comfort Food and we are from Alabama, now come on LoLo's."}
{"text":"tldr

The first time coming here the line was out of the door on a Sunday and decided to try another day.
Came on a Saturday night and got seated right away.
The place actually has a lot of energy and a good vibe.
Order took a bit long.

Got:
-baby ray (3 pieces of chicken, two waffles, onions and gravy on the side): waffles had a cinnamon taste to it. Chicken was good.
-sweet tea: on point"}
{"text":"My husband and I love trying new places to eat and we had never been here so thought let's give it a try. I'm so happy that we did. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with smiles and we're seated quickly our waitress came to the table Shannon who was awesome let us know everything that was on the menu from appetizers two main courses and all the different koolaids they had Shannon even suggested we try the Fried Green beans and we were not disappointed from the service to the food everything was excellent we will definitely be going back a must try if you've never been"}
{"text":"Sadly, very poor service is the primary reason for only two stars. We were seated by a very nice and friendly greeter and given a choice of tables. Soon after our drink order was taken. About 15 minutes later another server had noticed that our beverages were still on the bar and served them. A half hour after we were seated the original server took our food order. It should be noted that the restaurant was only half full. The chicken is good with a well seasoned batter. The waffle is generic, something you could easily make at home. I also had the mac & cheese and wouldn't recommend it as it was gummy. Lastly, I like gospel music but it was too loud to be able to hold a conversation over the screeching.   Overall, I won't go back. For authenticity, go to Roscoes."}
{"text":"Chicken is good, greens are good, smothered chicken is good, waffles are hit and miss, stay away from Mac and cheese and beans and rice. Service is friendly"}
{"text":"I went there on a Sunday afternoon and the wait was 2 hours. Seriously, do these folks think anyone is going to wait 2 hours to get in and then another hours for their meal . Service is very poor and very slow.  They always seem to have staffing issues. This is a very poor addition to the downtown Gilbert  restaurant area."}
{"text":"This is not a bad place, the portions are huge and you do get a lot of food! However I did think that their chicken was a little to greasy for me, and being pregnant it was very difficult for me to eat. 

I'm not a big fan of waffles that aren't crispy either. Their waffles were soggy and I can't say that I did like it. I don't know if I would go back here for that maybe if I would have tried the chicken and waffles with chicken that didn't have bone it could have been a little better"}
{"text":"We just moved here from Seattle and wanted to get out of the house, found this place and now it's on our rotation of places to go.  The food was good but it was the service that stood out, may be I'm used to rude people in Seattle but every one here had a smile and were happy to be there.  Customer service goes a long way.   Thanks"}
{"text":"Ordered carry out on 4/19 and did not get what I ordered. Paid extra for breasts and received thighs instead. I do not like or eat dark meat. Called to complain and the manager said I could come back within 24 hours and receive the breasts. I should have checked my order prior to leaving. Not a very good first impression. However, My wife's order was correct and she enjoyed it.
Return visit the next day was excellent. Maurice assisted me and the food and service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Today was my second time in this place for breakfast, and the two times I get a cup of coffee with very obvious and hard to miss lipstick on it. Ewww.
I don't think I will go back to this place. The place is nice, we sat in their patio, the grits and their biscuits are yummy though."}
{"text":"So , I have  heard of lo-lo's chicken and waffles . And finally decided to try it . My teenage kids had the lo-los chicken and waffles and I had the biscuits and gravy . The kids enjoyed the chicken , though we do a low salt food ; they enjoyed the chicken except for the salty skin . They removed the skin and ate the juicy and moist chicken . The waffle , was just a cinnamon waffle . Nothing special , and tasted like a cinnamon waffle . The biscuits and gravy, well the biscuit was crunchy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside . Good biscuit , but then they smothered it in a gravy that had , I think , a complete onion in the gravy . I can't tell what the gravy tasted like because all I tasted was onion . I love onion , but this was way too much . Over all , not a great breakfast experience. I guess this is what they call a soul food breakfast . But this was not my cup of tea . Also, they where playing religious music the whole time we where there . This made us uncomfortable .  I do not think I will be returning anytime soon ."}
{"text":"Sorry to say I went here with my daughter it was Daddy daughter dance night we had just had a good time at the dance.  I asked her where she wanted to go of course let me make my baby happy.  I ordered catfish it was fried hella crunchy outside inside was soft like raw fish sent it back came back the same way I left that ish on the table I paid for my dinner because my daughter enjoyed her french toast go figure.  But i was so irritated I had to go home and make myself something to eat.  Lesson learned I should have went to Applebees next door smfh"}
{"text":"This place is so good!! 10/10 would recommend! I really liked the #3- 3 pieces of chicken and 2 huge waffles, and our server Shannon was such a sweetheart! Check this place out if you can!"}
{"text":"They get 3 1/2 stars. I tried a variety things, and all of the portion sizes were nice and large, so bring your appetite, the food is good. I might have tried a few more drinks, but the prices seemed a little high (3.50) this is Vegas. The sweet tea is in a large mason jar, not to sweet. The chicken skin was very crispy, no big flavor rush, but juicy. The waffles have a cake like taste and texture, I'm taking mine home and putting them in the toaster oven. The eggs and grits were well cooked. Everything was on the table for you to make them your own. I tried the shrimp and grits with mushrooms and crispy bacon. I really enjoyed it, but it needed flavor, a little seasoning would have gone a long way or maybe a tasty sauce. The greens were not bitter. I'll have to try more sides I only tasted a little of the greens. Nice large biscuits and corn bread. The banana pudding looked amazing so we took two home. If you are going to do this order it at the table and pack it yourself, the one they pack is much smaller than the gorgeous one they put on the table and it should be half the price. They forgot to put the pudding in mine, so I had vanilla wafers, which are not my thing, with bananas and whipped cream. My Son had pudding in his and said it was really good. He said amazing, but I think it was because I couldn't taste it. I'll try them again, the people were really nice and everyone helped each other to make sure you were happy."}
{"text":"Food came no fries, fries came no food left sent back
Drink not refilled it was alcoholic 
We come here for breakfast and this is disappointing"}
{"text":"We love Lo-Lo's so much that we ate breakfast there 2 days in a row this week and are now considering it again for dinner tonight! The service can be a little slow, but thats because it's usually busy and there are so menu great items to choose from that everyone orders tons of food...that poor kitchen staff;) The chicken is fried to perfection, and manages to stay juicy. The apps are all good, and different choices than other places. Salmon croquettes so close to Mom's! Fish fried right, rice well-cooked, seasonings on point & all comes out hot. Oh and their hot sauce is good, too. I love the Geirgia On My Mind, and the Cucumber Watermelon Mojito. Cornbread heaven for sure omg lol nevermind, don't go...more room for us!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible service after waiting 40 minutes for a table . They sat us down and walked around are table for a additional 25 minutes before we asked for kool aid or water. Serve never came back. We watched  another party get seated next to us and they left because the serve never came to there table. The Manger went after them and they came back to there seat where a manger had a waitress take there order mind you it's been over a hour no one has taken are order or brought us any thing to drink. Drove from Cali to try this place thumbs down un organized not professional at all would not recommend it to anyone gotta do better"}
{"text":"Actually giving 4.5 stars.
Went here for lunch yesterday. I had Lolo's Punch which is vodka mixed with Kool-aide!! Yes Kool-Aide! Delish!
For lunch I had Sheedas special which came with 2 pieces of chicken (breast &wing) and a waffle.
The waffle was Bomb! Tasted like cinnamon. 
Chicken was hot, fresh and juicy. It was very flavorful, but i do think it needed just a tad bit more salt or seasoning.  I also had a side of yams.  The yams were maybe the best I've tasted. So good!!!
My hubby had the shrimp and grits which he liked, but said they were spicy and the menu did not specify that it was a spicy dish. It was all good though because he likes spicy food. 
All and all I thought the food was really good. I would definitely eat there again. Just took off a 1/2 star because i think the chicken needed more seasoning.  Other than that, really good experience."}
{"text":"Very very good chicken and waffles. Reminded me slightly of Roscoes, the chicken tasted good and the waffles are similar. But the waffles and butter are still a bit better at roscoes, they're fluffier. The service was good, took us like 5 to 7 minutes just to get seated, even thought it was really slow. Tons of open tables, the lady in the front was busy with another customers order or something. Took us about 20 or so minutes to get our food. Our server was the bartender, she was sweet. 

The OJ and sweet tea are absolutely delicious. This place has amazing prices and the food is quite good. This place is super similar to roscoes, so if that's what your craving in the vegas area, come.

I also tried their peach cobbler and was really disappointed... Best part of it normally is the crust but their peach cobbler is more like peaches and a spongy bread.. it was really generic.. Frozen cobbler from the store tasted 


Update: 

Came to have breakfast today and don't think well ever come back here again. Everything was just terrible. The host, young Mexican girl had no idea what she was doing. Had people waiting extra long even though there were multiple tables already cleaned and ready to go. The service was worse. Since we waited so long for a table we looked at the menu and already knew what we wanted. So exactly when we sat down we ordered our food. We got our drinks and waited 30 + minutes for our food. Our server stopped by after 30 minutes and finally said she'll check on our food. 

You can tell the whole staff was pretty disorganized and it didn't seem like any of them were properly trained in hospitality and a fast paced restaurant probably being this place is only busy really on the weekends. The runners that were running food were constantly taking food to the wrong tables, didn't know where items were going. It seemed like there were only 2 or 3 servers working and the service was bad. We were never checked on to see how we're doing, if we needed anything... one server that was a different section asked if we were doing ok but that's about it. 

We were honestly about to get up and just leave. We noticed a couple tables next to us were getting frustrated as well. Two tables near us waited 30+ minutes as well for their food as well. And then a table that got sat 15 minutes after us got their food before us.. which was crazy cause we ordered simple stuff, chicken and waffle and catfish basket (which wasn't good btw) and fries (the seasoning was good on them.) We asked for sauces twice, she forgot the first time. And she forgot to bring our hot sauce altogether so we just stole one from another table. 

They should really invest some time into training their staff. Not only will their staff make more money for the restaurant but for themselves as well for learning better service. Our server only visited our table 3 times, greet, 1 check up 30 minutes later and the check. She got a $3 tip. If she checked up on us more often and put some effort into trying to get our food out in a timely manner. It would've been a different story."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!  My worst dining experience in LV as a resident.  My GF loved Lo-Lo's from AZ and was so disappointed after a 25 min wait to sit at a table and not be served after 20 more min!  We even asked the hostess who our waiter was so she offered to get us our water and ice tea.  But after watching her do anything but get us a simple glass of water and hearing the trials of the 2 women near us who wait 45+ min just on their fried chicken order after placing we knew it's a hopeless and fruitless endeavor to eat here!  Never had this experience at Roscoe's :("}
{"text":"After visiting the Scottsdale and Phoenix Lo-Lo's several times, I wanted to try the newer Gilbert location. The service was fantastic and the chicken and waffles were perfect. Looking forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"So I came here today with my family, as the hostess tried to sit us, a BIG ASS RAT comes out from underneath the table, huge! I froze! All I could say was let's go let's go. It was so big & slow I could've taken a picture of it, but I was so disgusted. One of the waiters joked that it was the restaurants mascot, either way I don't want it, needles to say we will never go back."}
{"text":"Ate there today for the first time. I was amazed at how good the food was. I ordered the 'Backwoods\" which is chicken gizzards smothered in gravy & onions over rice. It was the best I have ever tasted. Service and atmosphere were also very good."}
{"text":"Great fried wings outside was crispy inside was moist. Service was really great she check on us few times and when she give us the to go container. She brought us to go cup."}
{"text":"Second time here. First time was busy and service was slow so let it slide. Food was basic and ok. This time was Friday at 4pm and only one other table. Hostess seemed confused and took us to our table where we sat for 5 minutes with no acknowledgment whatsoever. Got up to leave and staff didn't seem to care. Hope they have a great base as I will never return. Went to Joyride tacos where it was packed and served immediately."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. 
It took almost 1 hour to get mediocre (that is being generous) food with no apology from anyone.
I have heard good things about LoLo's but I unfortunately don't have anything good to see. 
We will never return."}
{"text":"It was a pretty good place, I just thought it was a little pricey. Our waitress was fantastic though, and I love that they have Kool-Aid drinks!"}
{"text":"I guess I'll start with the snot wad on the bottle of hot sauce at our table. I had the misfortune of touching it before seeing it. Then there was the chicken breast that came with the Mrs.'s waffle. It probably had suffered a long and gruesome death beneath those toxic orange warming lamps. It was rock hard and bone dry. Then another touching incident occurred when I moved my lunch basket. It felt like they dipped it in vegetable oil prior to serving my meal in it. You expect some grease in a chicken & waffle joint, but this made me lose my appetite. Best part of the meal was my Pepsi in a mason jar."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the worst experience I have ever had. Extremely rude- slow service. I had ordered a burger med well. IT WAS RAW! The waiter argued with me about it and took a small amount off my bill. When I exited the restaurant the very young valet attendant had back my car into a pole. They told me to move it then denied any such action. They are ignoring my phone calls. I will never recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Waited 30 min for slightly warm food while my mother's food came out piping hot. This is the second time I've been and had to wait half an hour to get my food. Scrambled eggs came out brown, sent them back and they came out brown again. The table next to us also had food sent back. Where's Gordan Ramsy when you need him because this kitchen is a nightmare."}
{"text":"It's rare anymore that you try a new restaurant that lives up to the hype. Lo-Lo's did that and more!  The service and atmosphere are great!  Our server was knowledgable and seemed to be very proud of where he worked!  Everyone was very happy to be there. It must be a great place to work.  The food is delicious! We had the biscuit and gravy platter and also the signature dish...chicken and waffles!  The chicken was amazing, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I would have preferred that my waffle was more crisp, but the flavor was excellent. We will be back soon! Great job!"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened a few weeks ago and when we tried to get in the first time there was an hour wait.  When we went Saturday there was a long wait also but we sat in the bar area (everyone in the party needs to be over 21).  The menu is extensive but being our first time we had to try the Lo-Lo chicken dinner which consists of your choice of an three pieces of chicken (but not more than one breast) and a waffle.  We did wait a long time but our waitress was attentive bringing drink refills while we waited.  When our meals came out they were hot and vey tasty.  The chicken was crispy and delicious but the waffles could have been cooked more.  We all thought they were not done enough.  I will definitely go back but next time I would order the chicken with another side.  They had choices of beans and rice, grits, french fries."}
{"text":"****** I think they hate Dutch bros *** No drinks from Dutch bros allowed in****  They said \"drink them before coming in.\"  Lo lo's you can keep your food.  

Seriously kicked 4 paying customers out... Oh well..  there's a few places around here."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE the food here .
If the food wasn't this good, I would never visit a restaurant with such poor customer service .
In the past I've always been sat in a decent time frame and served within reasonable time as well...HOWEVER the last two times have been ridiculous ... today for example ,
Walking in today I was so excited and ready to eat , there was about 2 people on the wait list in front of me yet was sat 30 min later ....After bruh seated I ordered a mimosa and a berry boob , while my brother ordered Kool-Aid and a DD With two sides of corn bread... the waitress did not check up on us at all, an hour went by and I actually got up and asked a different waitress for some help as we had been siting in the resurgent for over an HOUR and not even our drinks had even served to us.
A few minutes later the food came out and we were brought water . We never got the corn bread or the mimosa so once AGAIN I had to go hunt down a different waitress for help.
It makes me really upset because I always refer people here and talk this restaurant up so much , and to be \"forgotten\" and have to continuously ask for my food was so irritating, I will no longer be recommending this place to anyone ."}
{"text":"Great chicken and waffles. We love coming here for breakfast because it's not crowded and the food is yums."}
{"text":"The chicken is very tender and juicy and the waffles...ooohhh the waffles are so delish...very soft and flavorful! I would say my fave is the catfish nuggets and the fried tomatoes!!! Oh and I can't forget about the refreshing Mason Jar of Kool-aid Yum Yum Yum!!!"}
{"text":"So far it's a zero. Got 15 open tables and the hostess is holding up seating people. Not a good first impression. I take that it doesn't first impression doesn't  matter when your business is crowded."}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE service.. wow talk about lack of service and zero sense of urgency. And these kind of people are the ones asking to raise the minimum wage.. what a joke!! Save yourself the trip, avoid it at all costs!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Lil Amadi and a cup of coffee. The coffee was huge! The meal came out in good time. I enjoyed my meal. It was reasonable and I would definitely come back. My server Tenikia was nice and friendly too."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I love the atmosphere and design. It looks really nice and classy!"}
{"text":"Let's just say make sure you ware some pants with a little extra room in them
The fried chicken is amazing and holy Guacamole   their fried green tomatoes are amazing...YUM!!
I have never had collared greens well I tried them not bad, not bad at all ok they were good.. 
clean and friendly..."}
{"text":"Portions are pretty big but the food is just decent. I like their gravy but their rice seems microwaved."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. Our server was great....food was mediocre at best. Definitely have had better fried chicken. The chicken fried steak was rubbery. Best part of the meal were the hot sauce, corn bread and catfish. Will return to try some breakfast items next time."}
{"text":"Really good chicken and waffles. A unique combo. Sweet tea is southern sweet. Great during the day when there is no wait."}
{"text":"always a great time here, chicken and waffles always tasty, the waitresses are always nice and attentive, the music is old school, which we love, definitely a good vibe and a must whenever possible"}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Go here if you want the lousy music to drown out your conversation.  Won't even think about going back."}
{"text":"I was there today on my lunch break, there service sucked. I walked out before they could seat me....all the servers wanted to host, and the hostess didn't had no organization skills, the manager was called up as I walked in and it took him 10mins to come out... I asked if there was open setting in the bar area the hostess said no, so I was waiting on a table for 1 when another lady came in and asked the server if she could sit at the same table that wasn't open seating..the server let her sit in there...um isn't that the hostess job...everyone wants to delegate orders but no one will take them.."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is GREAT! 

The breakfast is GREAT! 

But the first time i went i ordered mac n cheese as one of my sides & it was horrible! Taste to boxed. Like it was velveeta or something. Definitely isnt like  Roscoes mac n cheese lol but the red beans & rice was good! & the yams! 
& i loved that they big ass pieces of cornbread lol

They also have some GOOOOD kool-aid. Lots of different flavors!"}
{"text":"OMG.  To begin with;  the chicken is just off the charts .  I'm beyond blown away.  

Not sure how they seem to improve upon perfection, but each experience surpasses the last.

The service as well as the food is beyond perfect.

Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great

I got the LoLo's  which is 3 pieces fried chicken and 2 waffles.  As a stand alone dishes neither would be anything to write home about but when paired together the sweetness of the waffle and saltiness of the chicken make magic. It's like Stockton and Malone...neither would not have been as great without each other.  Add a little of their hot sauce and it gets even better.

As for service the bartender/waiter made sure my water never ran out and was friendly."}
{"text":"More fried food then Ive ever eaten in one sitting. It was pretty okay but all one note. I guess cause we got there late, which meant we could only order fried food (weird store policy). No matter how many times I try chicken and waffles, it never really makes much sense to me. I like chicken, I love waffles. But the combination doesn't really make it any better (or worse) Lolo's version was of no exception. They did put cinnamon in their waffles, which to me was really off putting next to the spices of the fried chicken that in itself, was extremely salty. The service was underwhelming as well. Like you could see their super fake smile disappear as soon as they turned away. It was actually kinda funny."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. I was horribly disappointed. They have HORRIBLE SERVICE! We went for lunch on a friday. It wasn't that busy. We waited over 10mins for our server to come to the table. We ordered our food and drinks at the same time. We received our appetizer before we even got our drinks. Our server didn't check on us. Once we got our food. The food was ok. Nothing to write home about. I honestly think I was so turned off by the service I wouldn't go back to try anything else on the menu. I will say one thing....they have really good kool aid!"}
{"text":"Man....I hate to give such a low score, I really do but here's a little breakdown:

Pros:
-Virginia (waitress) You were Amazing from start to finish 
So helpful, Kind & super Sweet 
-Food was DELICIOUS (after it was sent back due to a few errors)
-Restaurant theme/decor very nice

Cons:
-Wait time was completely unacceptable 
We waited almost 15min just to speak with the hostess 
Took almost 30min to get a water when we sat down 
-Understaffed in kitchen for sure 
- Extremely unorganized 

I love supporting Black owned restaurants
I think this place has so much potential to be so Great but you all really need an organizational makeover because this place is painfully unorganized and you are loosing so much money and customers because of it 

I think that this restaurant needs to contact Hell's  Kitchen and have Gordon Ramsey get yall on track 

I hope to be back if things change next time I'm in town 

Good Luck guys"}
{"text":"If I could go lower than one star I would. I have been here at least a dozen times and I have always came back. I am 45 minutes into my visit after waiting 40 minutes for a table. Wow busy you would think? Well 50% of the dining room is empty but they had to stop seating because a group of 20 crushed the kitchen. Wait, 2o entrees slows the kitchen down so much you have to stop seating and then when you do ticket times are 45 minutes plus? I am just amazed. The topper was the visit from the manager and his complete lack of understanding as to what was happening and why. I am so disappointed because every time I have people in town this is a must for us. Never again....."}
{"text":"This is the best chicken and waffles joint I've ever been too! The food was amazing, chicken was really juicy and tender. The service was also incredible. Really nice people working there! The have bottomless mimosas too! I will be back again!"}
{"text":"I had Aunt Portia's chicken omelet, It was good! The service wasn't as good seemed as though our waiter, Sparky was only worried about the tables surrounding us."}
{"text":"So, I took my mother to Lolo's after she was adamant that we go out for Sunday morning brunch.  She was so adamant, that even after they told us the wait would be two hours, she insisted upon staying.  

After our legitimately two hour wait, our food was delivered to us rather promptly, which was great!  I ordered a big plate, Fried chicken, waffles, eggs, grits.  I was famished, would have eaten anything with gusto. Except... That our chicken was both tasteless and over fried, the onions undercooked, the waffle sort of wet with moisture on the bottom?  I understand the grits being unseasoned, not everyone prefers savory grits like I do.  And I'm not picky.  But everything?  

So, hungry as I was, I found myself taking my time, not to savor the tough chicken, but because I wasn't excited to eat it.  I cook, and I trust my taste buds.  This meal was a damn shame, and my mother's order was no better.

 We waited an additional ten minutes while our waitress came back with the syrup, and another ten after that for water.  I attribute the waits on stuff to how busy they were.  As for the rest?  Not sure I'll be back for that.  Maybe another location will have better food."}
{"text":"I'D GIVE ZERO STARS IF IT WAS AN OPTION

Service is terrible. We had a large party on a Sunday morning so we expected a wait, they told us that we wouldn't be seated together because there are \"so many of you\" and that we couldn't order everything on the menu if we had one check. The wait was very very very long. None of us were greated at the door, no \"Welcome to LoLos\" or \"Good Morning\" or anything.

We all had something wrong with our orders, they forgot half of the eggs, they didnt melt the cheese on the eggs, asked for sides of bacon, bacon never came. The bus boy said \"aight, i gotchu\" when we asked for something. Just ridiculous over all. 

The chairs are SO UNCOMFORTABLE

DO NOT COME HERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, GO TO EGG WORKS INSTEAD
For the shitty service you get and not fantastic food you might as well go somewhere else. 
I will never come back here."}
{"text":"We were very hopeful about this place. We went on Saturday night and it wasn't too busy. We were seated quickly but it took our server about 15 minutes to get to us and only after we asked where our server was. We ordered our drinks and food. It was about 45 minutes into waiting for our food and no waiter to be found and my friend had to go to the bar to order another drink and was ignored there. A manager was helping behind the bar and wasn't able to ring him up. Finally about 60 minutes of waiting we got our food. Mine and my friends food came with the wrong sides and after looking at it we actually didn't get all of the chicken we ordered. We let our waiter know and he went to check on it and said that they were having issues with the chicken breast so they would serve it later. If we hadn't pointed this out we would have been charged but not received the food. My mashed potatoes were cold underneath. So all in all it was a very poor experience and will not be back or recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Just so management is aware, one of your employees dined at Babystacks Cafe and I was seated next to him with my kids. He was wearing his Lo-lo's uniform, wreaked of alcohol, was still visibly drunk, was rude to the food server, complained that his crepes were cold (after letting it sit for 20 minutes), ate ALL of his food and then had the audacity to complain to the server and manager to get his meal comped since he didn't enjoy the food (which, again, he FINISHED). If these are the types of employees you want to represent your \"brand,\" I will spread the word that no one dine at Lo-lo's. For someone that is in customer service, to treat another person like total crap is unacceptable. You might be asking if the server was giving horrible service...the answer is no. He tended to my party of 4 with no problems, along with every other table he had. Here's a tip: Make sure your employees are out of uniform before they make total asses of themselves and misrepresenting your \"brand.\""}
{"text":"Went here this past week and it was okay. The grape koolaid was the best I've ever had! We went right they opened so we expected the food to taste and look fresh. The chicken looked and taste as if it was from the night before and fried again that morning .. the waffles were a bit dry.. they have nothing on roscoes!"}
{"text":"It's my birthday., i had been hearing about this Restaurant for years. They finally put one in the East Valley.  I had the chicken and waffles. It was amazing. The waffles are big and full of flavor with a hint of spices. The grits were cooked just RIGHT with butter on top. The chicken was fried and comes with generous portion. The food was delicious the service was great. Priced just right too. Left with a happy belly and purse..Thanks Lo Lo's."}
{"text":"Love this place. The chicken is crispy, seasoned, and delicious.. Ordered a side of eggs with cheese was amazing as well. Staff is very pleasant, quick service..."}
{"text":"First time at lolos had the greatest experience Shannon served me and she was awesome !!!"}
{"text":"Great service but horrible food. Chicken had no seasoning and flavor and was extremely dry. The waffles were soggy even my 5 yr old wouldn't eat it and that's his favorite food! 1st and last time... Popeyes has better chicken! ;)"}
{"text":"Food is always good and the environment is always upbeat. So I give 5 stats for that. But our server Sparks was the best server I have had in a long time. Very personable and friendly. Entertaining on a level that puts him in a league of his own. If you eat here ask for Sparks."}
{"text":"Tonight might have been one of our worst dining experiences ever. Have visited the original Scottsdale location numours times so we were excited for the one in Gilbert. The music was so loud in the restaurant our waiter could barely hear our order had to repeat it multiple times and yell it to him, the bass shook our table, and when we left it was like we walked out of a rock concert ears ringing. I'm all for a fun environment, but this was ridiculous. Like others the food took about 45 min to come out, the overall service was sub par. The chicken was good my waffle was hard, and by time we got our food we were well over it. We debated leaving after it took awhile to get our drinks, we wish we would have so we wouldn't have had to suffer through that nightmare of an experience.

I'm not going to be forgiving because it's new, this is a well established restaurant business, and a staple in the Valley. Very disappointed from every aspect of our experience."}
{"text":"I'd heard of this place in Scottsdale.  Never been there.  We discovered a new one in Gilbert and decided to visit.

It was very busy.  Made for slow service (which they apologized for repeatedly).  It was loud.  They have a full bar and TV's with sports on them.   Despite photos of (I assume) the owner's kids on the wall it doesn't really feel like a family soul food joint.  Not that I'm an expert, but I have been in one or two over the years.  Serving drinks in Ball (mason) jars doesn't really make a big difference in this regard.

Went for a variety of foods to try them out. Simple for first visit. Chicken, waffles, grits, home fries.  The waffles were thin, which I liked.  Had a slight cinnamon flavor to them.  They claim their syrup is 100% maple, which is good (if surprising...most restaurants use fake stuff).  

The chicken was nothing special.  It was fine, but Pollo Loco has more flavor.  However, I will say that the coating was very crunchy and not greasy.  So they did a good job with the frying.  I would just like a bit more flavor.

The grits were almost flavorless.  Not an expert, but last time I had grits they had a bit more flavor.

The home fries are really a diced and fried (pan fried?) potato with some chopped peppers and onions.  The seasoning was really nice.  They were probably the best thing we had.

Overall it was OK.  I don't really get why people rave over it.  It's fine, but not special or extraordinary.  Nearby is Liberty Market, Joe's BBQ, and the Farmhouse, all of which are better (though none do fried chicken)."}
{"text":"My mom, my sister and I come here a lot! The food is amazing the customer service is Great ! I definitely Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! My family and I went here and sat for two almost before we was even served the food came out it was cold couldn't eat it sent it back came back still cold set outside had to be moved inside cuz it got too hot waiting for the food come to find out they've had to bring new people and because they fire 18 people and got rid of management staff one of the waitresses hair was so long it fell in my child's plate on top of her Burger bill came to $51 because we had drank some of the drinks and ate some green tomatoes I paid $20 what a God awful ordeal don't go and waste your time they will never ever ever ever get our business again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to see others had a bad experience.  I always feel you should give  a place at least a month to work out all the quirks.  We had to wait about 45 minutes. The atmosphere is super friendly.  The food was oh sooooo GOOD! There were 7 of us girls there for lunch, we didnt ask the waitress for separate checks she just did it for us.  How thoughtful.  As we were all leaving, behind the establishment, some guy with bright pants told us to be sure to come back.  Absolutely we will.  Friendly service like that, you can count on it.

HUGE SHOUT OUT TO OUR GUY KYLE (FROM NEW JERSEY) WOW WHAT GREAT SERVICE HE PROVIDED FOR MY HUSBAND AND I!! THANKS!!"}
{"text":"My food was great, for my wife not so great. Waiter did not take his time to listen to the order and kept running away to flirt with the waitress so he completely messed up the order twice. Over medium eggs she requested, took it upon his self to give her over easy. She asked for momma whites and he gave her biscuits and gravy even after she asked what choice of taste do they offer. When the manager realized the errors. He did not come over to apologize for the mistake, nor did the waiter. He made it seem as if he was going to comp her meal. Funny did all for that just want what she ordered. Didn't give her the cheese that came with the meal, no refills on KOOLAID. I even asked if they had peach cobbler when I placed my order. He said yes, great I'm gonna get some. Nope he handed us the bill and basically told us to keep it push. Bad thing was it was slow. Time like that would be an up selling strategy. 30 minutes for the food to come out no cobbler, no sorry, no toast or cheese with the momma whites and over easy eggs that wasn't asked for. Really disappointing I wish I could put  half a star. I was so upset that I didn't even order my to go order because the service was terribly below standard. As a manager I would never allow my associates to perform at average or below. This business has come a long way since Phoenix. SMH brand standards and above."}
{"text":"\"let's give it a try\" turned out to be a very good decision! The food here was great. My boyfriend who is usually a picky eater enjoyed the hood Burger very much. I had the DD chicken and waffles and that was delicious. Nice and crispy chicken with soft , juicy meat on the inside. It's definitely a lot of food for a very good price! Will be back again."}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits are my fav! Always good!  Great service from Ron at the bar! Very attentive and helpful! Will be back like always! Oh and the music is always on point!!"}
{"text":"Got here at 10:30 Sunday morning.   Still waiting at 11:20... Kitchen super slow and service leaves a good bit to be desired.

Our waitress Kash was exceptionally friendly and was apologetic for the wait.  Said there had been a 30 person party that ordered just before us.  

Food was good.  Chicken and waffles were exceptional and the shrimp and grits was massive.  Had not eaten at all and could not finish it.  

Will try perhaps another time, but be aware there might be a wait."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and Devin provided us with fantastic service.  There was a bit of a wait but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"The pineapple pancakes were fluffy and the bacon was crisp. Early (early early - like when they first open) morning wait time was only 15 mins and had food ordered and out to us in 20 mins. We have tried other times and have been told an 1hr and 45min wait time. Yikes! I've had the fried green tomatoes (to-go) and they were absolutely phenomenal. I was super impressed with them. I highly suggest trying the togo window if you are looking for fast service. Otherwise, plan on having a wait."}
{"text":"my family and I love Lolo' 's and we been to Phoenix and Scottsdale location many times. a year ago we moved to chandler and we're excited because we're so close to Gilbert location. well I can say out of the times we been to Gilbert location , food is still delicious BUT the service is HORRIBLE just HORRIBLE  these kids they have working there don't know there job, our orders are always messed up we have to ask for our drinks and food 2-3times and they won't be that busy , it's like they are so clueless and don't know wth they are doing , last night takeout order was the final straw, I think my family and I will take the drive out to phx Lolo's and get quality service , I really hope management see's this post because I know I'm not the only one who's had horrible experiences at this location I will give 3 stars cause the food is still delicious but the service sucks !!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken was AWESOME, waffles were like Eggo waffles. The rest of the food was good as was the service."}
{"text":"The last few times we were here it was amazing. This time I bragged to my brother and sister in law about how good it was and wanted to bring them. 
So we get seated no problems and watch as the lady directly next to use has four people ask if she is good. One brings a to go box, then the other brings a bag. Then the waiter comes out and ask if she is good. She says bring a check. Then they bring a check .....
At this time we haven't been visited by a single person or brought a drink. So we ask that waiter and he keeps looking around confused like ummm not sure who your server but I'll help you as soon as I'm finished with this customer. 
It got better and my family was happy with the food. That waiter was super nice for the rest of the meal and helped us out. But the semi embarrassment of this event alone is worth the two starts. Completely looking forward to future visits to bring it up to the four and five stars I know they deserve."}
{"text":"Is fantastic shrimp and grits is the best I have ever tasted I can't get past it on the menu every time I go there I have it great environment great food great people a wonderful place in Las Vegas everyone should go there and try their wonderful menu"}
{"text":"Delicious. My husband and I went there for breakfast and the service was wonderful and the food was amazing. He got Lo Lo's and I got Tre Tre's. Basically chicken and waffles large and medium orders. Both were delicious. Everyone should go and try them. The chicken was so flavorful and crispy skin and super moist."}
{"text":"LO-LOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSS!!!

Love love love this place. 

Finally tried their fried chicken gizzard, cat fish, and zucchini. It was pretty amazing. 

Their sweet tea was a bit too sweet this time but I just diluted it with more ice and water so it was okay. I like to get their chicken thigh smothered in gravy and the drum stick and wings crunchy with a side of mac n cheese, corn bread, and biscuit. Oh and how could I forget their WAFFLE! I always ask them to cook the waffle a bit longer to get that crispiness. grub grub grub!

You'd be stupid to not try their Stupid Fries so be smart and try it :)

My friends visiting from CA loved it all and they finished all of their food. They said it was better than Roscoe's Chicken Waffle and I agree with them. 

Service is always stellar here except our server had an issue splitting our bill correctly and accidentally charged us 3 times. I'm still waiting on the other 2 pending credit card charges to fall off lol.. Other than that, I've always had a great dining experience at LOLO'S!"}
{"text":"This place has continued to decline since it first moved into Gilbert. Tried to have dinner here tonight and the customer service was terrible. The manager walks up to your table with attitude. Do not waste your time here... food quality also continues to decline. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place while visiting from NY for my bday. OMG! Best recommendation ever! I ordered the catfish and mac and cheese with spinach. Catfish was good, mac and cheese could have been a little better, but I can digest it. I also had a strawberry margarita. Also, since it was my birthday, they brought out a HUGE slice of red velvet cake, which was also yummy! Also, they were blasting 90's R & B and rap. Can't go wrong with that LOL. The next time I come out to Las Vegas, I'm definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"This review is for the service only, the food was great! 

The waiters argued for several minutes about who would take our large party. After about 1 hour, we were seated. Our waitress was mediocre at best. From what I could see, most of the staff was slow and in no hurry at all to hustle during the Easter lunch rush. There were several empty tables but they were quoting a 45min-1hr wait. If the food were not so amazing, I would never return again."}
{"text":"This place is excellent....   was a little long of a wait to be seated, but was all worth it when we sat down to eat. Waiter was great, very energized and funny...  A must stop for me and the family when we are in Arizona...   The location for this review was the spot in Gilbert....."}
{"text":"ok peeps are telling the truth, Tues.nite 8pm no waitress to greet us or offer us H20 for exactly 15 mins. ignored completely.   Finally came, no apology for the wait, very nice, sorta clueless though, after bringing delicious piping hot food she did check on us several times. Dont expect greasy fried chicken at all, its good and hot and crispy but couldnt figure it out...I kept getting a taste and sift of fish as though it was fried in old re-cycled fish oil. That sorta bugged me, but I was starving...Large pieces of chicken, but how they fry it without it coming out greasy is beyond me...good gravy, good greens, great cocktails.    I shall return and will just have to be patient waiting on a waitress.  Dont.I repeat Dont go on a Sunday. Packed before and after Church crowd....No parking spaces at all.....It probably wont last here in Vegas, it was totally empty on a tues. eve From 7pm till closing.   cant stay open long if you are not bringing in the customers. waiting for a waitress to come and greet you when there are only 4 folks in the restaurant though is unnacceptable.....my family went the week of June 26th. Literally walked out sat,sat, sat, waited waited waited for their food forever, walked out....."}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative amount of stars. This place is a joke and the service is the worst I have ever experienced. My son wanted to go to dinner for his birthday and chose LoLo's. We waited 30 minutes for our table and then proceeded to wait for an additional 25 minutes before a sever even bother to acknowledge our table. When she did, she did NOT introduce herself and then did not ask us if we were all on the same check but told us we were all going to be on the same check and that she was only going to take orders from one of us so we needed to decide who the boss was. Her attitude was nasty and she was just rude. At that point we ordered our drinks, appitizers and meals all at the same time. They turned the music up so much that I  could not even hold a conversation without yelling, it wasn't that loud when we walked in. Another 35 minutes passed before we ended up walking out. In those 35 minutes NOTHING was brought out. Not our drinks or appitizers, they didnt even bother to pick up the menus from our table (not that that is an issue or anything, I'm just trying to show how ignored we were.) They weren't even that busy. We wasted our time and ruined my son's 12 birthday dinner and our night. I emailed to complain and apparently they ignore emails too as I have yet to receive a response. This is the worst experience at I restaurant I have ever had and we will never go back."}
{"text":"I give this spot 2 stars only because of Nick, the bartender, who is AWESOME! The assistant manager, DWAYNE is TERRIBLE! I found him lost for words when a problem came across his lap. We didn't wait for a table since we walked right up to the bar in which is the prime spot to sit if you are with 1 other person. The waitresses were AWESOME, especially FAITH who recognized me from being a regular.

 It took my friend and I exactly \"1 HOUR\" to receive our food . I reported this to the manager DWAYNE, who didn't know how to handle our situation. SMH, DWAYNE should find a job in which he is comfortable with and not one as busy as, this one since, all he could do was apologize while stating that they are working on the cooks being more prompt! A good manager doesn't point fingers but should accept responsibility.

 I have been a manager/shopper for years and whenever a problem as this should arise, I would personally have compensated a meal or drink, to prove to the customer that we appreciate their business and wouldn't want this one bad experience to ruin future visits. I wasn't looking for a free meal but it does show that a good manager can address a situation where all parties involved are happy and will return to my establishment. Just saying DWAYNE!"}
{"text":"i love it!!! 
I had Yoo' Mama Biscuits, and let me tell you how good they were! The gravy was just right! The biscuit was huge! 
& they have KOOLAID my kids loved it! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I tried biscuits & gravy and I loved them! The food had great taste , it came out hot and tasted so fresh! Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing service and Amazing food! The fried green tomatoes and the chicken and waffles are scrumptious!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed! I was excited that they opened up a location nearer to us than the one in Scottsdale and we were able to finally try it out after passing due to long waits on the weekend. 

Unfortunately I didn't have a great experience. The chicken lacked seasoning it seemed and the fried green tomatoes had far too much breading and tasted bland as well.  The people were nice and the service was average, I guess. We didn't wait too long for our order, so I guess that's a plus, though when it arrived it was incorrect.  May give it one more try, but I'm in no hurry.  I hope they start seasoning the chicken before then.  Not everyone smothers it with hot sauce."}
{"text":"I was excited to see that Lolo's was opening a location in Gilbert. I finally made my way there on Tuesday afternoon and I have no plans to go back. I figured since it was pretty slow we'd get our food in no time. Not only was the service slow but the food was bad and I'm still left with a bubbly stomach! We had to flag our server down whenever we needed something, even though every one was standing around doing nothing. The food was bland and had no seasoning. My waffles came out cold and hard. When I asked for different ones, I was just going to take them to go, I still had to wait about 20 minutes. When I asked my server about it she went to check and came back with a story that they got burned and more had to be made. WTH? At that point, I knew I wouldn't be going back to that location. I'm seeing a lot of negative reviews so I really hope they get it together at this location because they're in a great spot hour business."}
{"text":"After years of hearing about this place my wife and I and another couple went to the Gilbert location for lunch.  Our first impression was that the music was overly loud.  Okay we can deal with that.  Service was fine, no problems there.  I ordered their blue cheese bacon burger medium rare.  It came medium.  Okay, I know most places can't cook a burger patty to medium rare so I deal with it.  My disappointment was that I did not understand that the blue cheese was in a spicy, Cajun?, sauce that completely overwhelmed the blue cheese. The patty might have had some flavor but the sauce was so overpowering I could not tell.  The meat itself was also dry.  My wife ordered the catfish and was very pleased.  Be aware that the fries come sprinkled with a red hot powdery spice, too (red pepper or chili powder, not sure).  The other couple ordered the signature chicken and waffles, with an extra waffle.  Now, I've never ordered that anywhere because it always looks like way more than I can eat. Ads make it look like you are getting a huge Belgian style waffle with a big hunk of chicken.  The waffles here are just normal size ones obviously cooked on a home style griddle.  I did not taste the chicken but just looking at the cut up pieces on their plates it looked dry.  The couple confirmed that it was very dry.  Maybe it sat under the heat lamp too long.  They both said the waffle was flavorless, nothing special, and much smaller than what they had been anticipating, too.  So, if you like fried catfish this may be a place to try.  And to top it all off, the bill, with a 15% tip came to $44!!!  For lunch!   In downtown Gilbert!  We don't know what the hype is all about and will cross this joint off places to return to."}
{"text":"We went to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles last Saturday to celebrate my mom's birthday. We were very excited as we had never been and had heard it was great from several friends. We were greatly let down when we discovered the food was mediocre and the service was horrible. Anyone with children knows to order their food immediately to avoid any whining and potential tantrums, so that we did. My mom was running a tad bit late so my husband and I placed our food orders next. Five minutes later my mother arrived and then placed her order. 10 minutes after THAT my husbands food arrived and there was NO sign of our children's order. We inquired about the status of the kids' meals and were informed they would be coming shortly... shortly as in another ten minutes along with my mother's order! At that point in time there was no word about my plate so I began to eat my husband's left overs (the waffles were worse than Waffle House, absolutely no flavor and very chewy). Ultimately I had them cancel my plate and received no apologies.
I've gone on Yelp and reviewed comments on the different locations in the Phoenix area. Apparently this location needs major attention as at this point in time I don't see us going back."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed and for the cost not worth it.  I love me some southern food and I always promote Roscoes in California and people have been telling me if i like roscoes i need to try Lolos. I truly was open minded i tried the mac n cheese which is a easy staple that should be amazing at a place like this it was awful. Might has well have been reheated kraft with extra cheddar on it. The catfish was ok but extremely small portions. I also had one of there burgers which was just awful no joke it felt like a \"premium\" burger from mcdonalds and it was $16 mind you getting a burger at a chicken joint is my bad. The only single redeeming thing was there honey chicken biscuit.

If i ever came back i would just stick to the chicken only but even then its not worth going out of my way for. Honestly the whole place just seemed gimicky and not authentic at all."}
{"text":"Good food real busy memorial day weekend good overall but not roscoes friendly and good service"}
{"text":"It was terrific. Second time I've been here and was equally pleased each time. Prompt service, steaming hot chicken and all the southern style sides you can imagine. It's a do-over."}
{"text":"Best southern food, and I love the atmosphere !!! Kinda a long wait, but totally worth it ! Plus, the staff is so friendly !"}
{"text":"Took 45 minutes to get our food. We only ordered two dishes. People that sat after us were getting their food before us as well. I asked the waitress why and she said they ordered food that cooks faster. Umm ok. We also had a coupon for a free side and she said they don't take those coupons anymore even though there was no expiration date on it. Not a good experience. What might have helped was an update or two while we waiting for our food, but our server didn't come by much while we waited."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Average at best for breakfast. If that is there idea of what southern breakfast is supposed to be; they need to take visit to the south and see what southern breakfast should taste like."}
{"text":"A waste of calories.  Fried chicken was dry and lacked seasoning and the waffle was 'flat'. Hubby's burger was better.  Not happy!"}
{"text":"Work in an office right down Rainbow and wanted to place a to-go order for the whole office. But they wont do to -go orders for 60 days after opening. They said I could come in sit down order food they would bring it out to me on plates then put it in To-go boxes (FOR THE WHOLE OFFICE). This place lost a lot of money today... Not sure I will make a trip out for the customer service or corporate rules...."}
{"text":"This place was the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. The manger was on her phone while I was asking for help for about 20 minutes straight. The servers didn't ask if we needed anything and when I did ask for something they didn't want to bring what we asked for."}
{"text":"Ordered food, had to wait over an hour while other people were served. Walked out and never received my food. I was assured the wait would only be 2 more minutes 30 minutes before I left. We were told the reason for the wait was because of ordering chicken breasts. However, we watched multiple people that ordered after us receive chicken breasts. I would not recommend this location!"}
{"text":"First time at the Gilbert location. Awesome food as always. Got the Betty's boob then banana pudding for a small dessert."}
{"text":"LoLos Chicken and Waffles was a tasty experience! I give it 3 stars because of the food, wait, and service. The food was good I had the famous seafood platter sigh catfish filets, yams, macaroni, and corn bread. The fish had too much cornmeal breading and not enough seasoning, the yams and macaroni were both delicious. And so was the corn bread! I was satisfied with the meal. Their sweet tea is very good as well! I really like it the mason jars that it came in they were large. My boyfriend got the entree platter with chicken gizzards, catfish nuggets, and fried green tomatoes. They platter was good well seasoned and large. The chicken gizzards were delicious and huge! We also had mojitos and mimosas and they were good as well! Overall I'd give it a 3, and I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"The chicken was fair at best, service was friendly and attentive. My fried chicken breast was dry like it had been sitting under heat lamps for a long time. We ordered fried green tomatoes and had to remind our server as they did not come out with our meal.  I just wasn't impressed, truly I think I get better quality chicken from the Albertson's deli.  This was our third time trying Lolo's and to be honest it will be our last."}
{"text":"When I first tried Lo-lo's I was blown away. I was ecstatic knowing I wouldn't have to drive down to Los Angeles for Roscoe's chicken anymore. Lo-Lo's chicken is juicy, cooked to perfection. Their corn bread muffin is to die for. However, went back for the second time - the chicken was still good, the corn bread muffin a bit dryer than the first time and the SERVICE, oh soooo bad. Sat for 15 mins still with no one coming up to even take our drink orders. We finally flagged down this kind waitress who insisted to take out orders even though it wasn't her area. The waitress in our area finally came and things got a bit worst. One thing for sure, when you want Lo-Lo's chicken get it to go! Hopefully that would be a better experience!"}
{"text":"honestly, Lolos is our favorite spot to eat. top 10 for sure. the food is absolute fire. im from Cali and it blows roscoes out the water. food, lemonade, and the greatest 90s love songs including kc n jojo... but in vegas, it differs from the AZ spots because it lacks the service that Phoenix lolo has. we were served on a busy day and we never asked for a refill. they were on point and always checking on us.

but today in vegas, there was two other occupied tables and tho our server was very nice, we were kinda ditched after our first roubd of drinks, then food came and tasted awesome, but had nothing to wash it down with. 

benefit of the doubt? vegas is full of snotty people and customer service becomes complacent? LOVE THE FOOD THO."}
{"text":"Folks...this here is the real deal, brothers and sisters!!! Unbelievable food.....from the fried green tomatoes to the homemade banana puddin - every single dish was spectacular.   So much flavor, so good, every last bite and our server Marc was super attentive and on top of it!!! Go to Lolo's -you won't be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"Food was good....our waiter Steven was awesome too....great service. It was our first time here and we plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Tried Lo-Los a couple weeks ago via my friend who ordered catfish, greens and sweet potatoes. The food was pretty good then, but oh man was it a different experience this time. The catfish was spongy, stale and a bit over cooked. The Mac and cheese was flavorless and the greens were too greasy. The wait time was ridiculous especially considering it was a bad meal. I may try it again eventually... But it will be a while before I do."}
{"text":"Went back in on 6/12/16 and they have really turned this place into a well oiled machine. Seating was faster than the given wait times, food was fast and fresh, and service was absolutely top notch. Management was actively greeting customers and taking care of their staff as well. Great experience and I am glad to see his location running as well as the others. Best fried chicken in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I don't know why the reviews for this place is so low but I had a great first experirnce here. I ordered the chicken tenders basket. The chicken was well seasoned, hot, and were very generous with the portion. The waffle of course was good and was a perfect compliment. For a drink I had their red kool-air that I had them mix with lemonade to cut the sugar a little. Please spread this chain to central Texas!"}
{"text":"At first things were okay. Our server seemed attentive for how busy it was. I ordered a hand made lemonade which tasted like maybe at one time it was lemonade but they stretched it out so much it just tasted like sugar water. It seemed like the slower it got the worse the service got. getting drinks took forever, dirty dishes weren't cleared and there were flies everywhere. In fact as I watched another waiter bring chicken out to a customer she had to shoo flies away as she put it on the table. Nothing memorable and nothing worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Honestly I have never experienced better service at any restaurant. Everybody seemed genuinely happy-they all had smiles on. It felt more like being welcomed into a friend's home than being seated at a restaurant. The hostess was awesome and so was our waitress. 
I had the Malaysia cheeseburger and fries. The burger was actually seasoned and had flavor. Burgers are usually a safe bet, but this was more than that. It was genuinely GOOD. My husband got the #3 (can't recall the name) with three piece of chicken and two waffles. The waffles are cinnamon-y and fluffy. The chicken was moist and the skin was crispy and delicious-I kept stealing his food. We will definitely be back, and I'll be trying some breakfast options next time!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write a review but i had to. So i came in today as a birthday lunch w my family. We arrived and were greeted by an older lady in the front. We were a party of 5, 2 being infant/toddler, 2 adults and 1 child. We were sat in the middle of the room, given 2 high chairs on a table that sits 4. We noticed a lot of bigger parties around. We waited a good almost 30-40  minutes after we sat down, not even a drink order was taken. There was a couple behind us, who when we arrived had just gotten their food, ate, got their table cleaned and another couple was placing their order.  I literally had to call over another server to our table who was in our \"area\" to ask her if she knew who our server was. She said she did not but would take our orders anyway. While she took our drink order, the couple behind us got their food. We waited another 25 minutes for our food. And no one else even came to our area as \"our server\" another couple i noticed behind us on the other end got their drinks but they never got to place an order and they left. Their table was cleaned off without hesitation or question. We didn't get refills, and the server came around 3x once to drop off our drinks, another to say our food was almost ready and another to drop off our food. My daughter was getting hangry so i had to request for her food to come out first. It did and ours came out 10 minutes later. We all ate and our food was warm at best. The drinks (we all got different.kool-aid flavors) were delicious and in huge mason jars. I got the DD the chicken was moist and tender; thr waffle was decent, my 10 year old got soggy old looking bacon and red velvet pancakes (which were ok), my husband got hot link sandwhich (it tasted similar to a hot dog, the bbq sauce was good but the link was eh. My young daughter got mac n cheese and i can't put my finger on it but it was lacking something. We also got chili cheese fries and the cheese was under the chili and not melted. Overall we paid $70 for our meal. Would i go again?? maybe, but not w my family, i will call in my order and pick it up. Cuz the table service was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Nice place. Not great but ok. The chicken is not that great. The waffles are decent and the Bloody Mary with bacon was great. I didn't need the bacon but it was a nice touch. The gizzards don't need that much breaking. I'd like to taste the actual gizzard in the future."}
{"text":"The excitement was building as we waited 40 minutes to be seated, but why SO LOUD IN HERE... this venture for Chicken and Waffles seemed we were at the club first of all.. anyway finally get seated and wondered the whole time must be short staffed as multi tables were open...i love the menu items on the menu actually wished today they Had Stayed on the menu... oddly enough A Lady in we will call it a pink blouse appeared and walla the music went down and staff started appearing on the work floor... I believe the boss appeared, thank goodness I can now hear, but hear this.... I will not return"}
{"text":"Love this place! Depending on the time of day and if it's a holiday getting in without a wait can be easy. The food is good. Sometimes we have gotten cold food but they always rectify the situation. Love the staff, very friendly and always helpful!"}
{"text":"Juicy chicken but their waffles weren't that good. I would recommend getting one where a side is included like Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Food was good, nothing sets it apart from all the southern cooking I've devoured. Ambiance was casual and relaxed. Accommodating service, but the drinks are too sweet for my taste. (I tend to drink dry) the pairings with waffles and pancakes were just the right fit and the way they cook their chicken, is good in flavor. I was hoping for bottomless mimosas even on Fridays--but only available during weekends."}
{"text":"I went back for the fried green tomatoes which are very good! The lemonade was fantastic and the service its always prompt"}
{"text":"I'm visiting family coming in from Chicago. We met up with a friend that lives here as well and she recommended Lolo's. I'm not a fan of chicken and waffles but I didn't mind checking out this place. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive(shoutout to our waitress Stacey). They played a lot of old school R&B music. They have interesting titles for their meals \"Hot Ghetto Mess\" and \"Phat Azz Samich\". I had the Famous Soulfood Platter where I got 2 pieces of Catfish(needed some lemon pepper seasoning...it's a Chicago thang!), and 2 sides: mac and cheese, and smothered potatoes. The mac and cheese was a bit thick and the smothered potatoes as not quite how I expected but they were ok. This place will definitely give you more than you need for a good price. They had some Chicago style mild sauce you know we had to get a sample. Didn't come close to it lol but hell no one knows how to emulate that anyhow."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went Thursday lunch time. It was busy, they assumed my daughter was over 21,was gonna put us at the bar. Waiting a little longer for a regular table, we're seated with in a few minutes. Our order was taken and served I think appropriate length of time. Food was good, no complaints,  but behind us 2 other waitress argued over a booth. Kind of inappropriate, that's the only problem.  I'm sure you will work out the kinks...welcome to the best of the west shopping center"}
{"text":"I have wanted to go to Lo-Lo's for over a year with my friend Annah for our annual movie and dinner  night. So I was very disappointed when I finally went there and experience that me and my friend Annah had. I was the first one there and the hostess seated me and I did not get greeted by my server until after my friend showed up mind you she was about 5 maybe 7 minutes behind me which was not a bad thing but to be there for that long and realize that you don't get greeted by your server and they don't even offer you water is a little bit troubling. She finally did greet us af 5 -10 mins of my friend getting there. She brought us waters and gave us time to order. And this happened a lot she give it time to order and it felt like she disappeared came back took her order got it wrong and then disappeared again came back brought our food disappeared again she never asked us if if you're enjoying your mail if we liked everything or anything like that till the end of our meal she forgot her sweet tea and then we we acknowledge that hey go ahead and bring us the bill cuz we have to go and you didn't bring us our sweet tea she never apologized for it or anything she just gave us our check and left again so I paid her the cash and left her a very bad tip and usually I'm not a bad Tipper but I felt like I heard service was so poor and she didn't care and it's not like Lolo's is really busy it was just frustrating. This whole situation doesn't even describe the food the only good thing about Lolo's is there chicken I thought it was a very very good I don't understand why their grades aren't smooth they are kind of like a just a hockey puck they were just hard on their eggs were over scrambled the potatoes were fried but they were like dry and then the fish had more batter on it than fish itself. I will never go back again! And the toast was dry old cold toast. So cold that the butter didn't melt...was so upset and dissappointed....never again"}
{"text":"Second time in and I like this place. 

First the staff was very friendly both trips and the restaurant and small bar are kept very clean. 
This trip a very friendly and efficient Tenikia  served me from behind the bar. She was very friendly and paid attention to small details in her service routine 
I think both time here I ate breakfast and the biscuits are huge and excellent. 
Food here is cooked with care, fresh and nice portions. 
I promise to try the chicken and waffles next time"}
{"text":"I had to see what this place is all about. As a Southern Cali native, Roscoe's has my heart and I needed to see of there's a worthy substitute. Sadly Lo-Lo's was underwhelming. 

Let me say that the service was wonderful! We sat and was acknowledged immediately. There was no long wait and everyone was very attentive. 

Now the food. The fried green tomatoes were good!! Great crunch and flavor! The chicken and waffles looked great! However 2 of my 3 chicken wings were overcooked and dry; and there was an overall lack of flavor. The waffle was nothing to talk about, I only ate half. 

I was hoping for more and Lo-Lo's did not deliver. Because the service was so good and they had other good looking options on the menu, we will be returning to give some of those a try. 

Go 'head and give me a try... it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Service bad, manager rude and aggressive....my friends and I got there before it opened. Once in side manager was rude and said sit down. Once at a table it took half an hour to order drinks and food. Once drinks were ordered it took another half hour for our drinks. Still waited another half hour for food. Finally some of our group walked out and complained to the manager. When complaining to manager, manager got aggressive and in the face of patron. Would not go back due to service and management."}
{"text":"Service was pretty lousy. I've never eaten anywhere where it takes 15 minutes to get water on the table. We were all discussing just leaving by the time our food finally showed up (really took a long, long time) and someone from our table had to physically get up and ask a hostess to get us our check because we were waiting forever for that too. I'm pretty sure they just forgot about us at some point. Food was okay but definitely overpriced. Won't be giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about!
Dined late Saturday night and service was poor and very slow in the restaurant with 8 tables seated.  Seated by a manager and the walls in our both were greasy and the salt and pepper shakers were greasy and disgusting. Felt prices were very high for quality and portions. Ordered a few sides items for $4.50 and was outrageous for the small quantity, especially white rice. The corn tasted like it was straight out of a can. Kool aid was good, but again $4.50 is crazy.  Definitely disappointed and wont be visiting again."}
{"text":"I'll try to stay positive, but that is very hard to do after eating here. 

We'll start with the Pros:
- Fried Green Tomatoes were very good.
- Sweet Tea was delicious.
- Restaurant interior was very nice.
- Fried Chicken was tender.
- Good portion size.

Now the Cons:
- Too much breading on the Fried Chicken
- Never offered any drink refills.
- Our waiter, who was a \"supervisor\", had to ask us 3 times what our order was.
- Several other waiters were arguing in the back corner of the restaurant (about 10 feet from our table)
- I've never been to a restaurant, until now, where waiters were sitting around eating food while their customers were waiting for the check (they actually seemed over-staffed).
- The Collard Greens looked like they came out of can.
- The Cole Slaw had no flavor.
- The fries tasted like store-bought fries (for an additional $2), which our waiter said would be amazing.
- When asked what type of fries they had, our waiter's response was \"french fries\" (and he wasn't joking).

The Health Inspection Rating of a B should have been my first warning that this was not going to be the experience I had hoped for.

I don't think the couple across from us was having a good experience either, as the gentlemen was questioning the freshness of the dessert he was given in a to-go container, asking several times if it was made fresh today, and all the server could say was that it was put in that container today."}
{"text":"Ok, business first... THE FOOD. Im from Cali and grew up on Roscoes and this is WAY BETTER! No lie
Corn fritters: if corn fritters had a baby with a jalepeno popper. Very tasty! 
Mac n cheese: creamy and cheddary. Definitely could have had several servings. 
Yams: very sweet and pretty good. I have never liked yams from a restaurant before(mine are always better and they are usually canned in restaurants). But these were surprisingly good! 
Waffles: meh, a little soggy but very flavorful. Im not the biggest waffle fan anyways. 
The chicken: ON POINT!!! Omg there are no words!!!! This was perfectly golden, flavorful fried chicken! The breast wasnt dry and the meat was so tasty, down to the bone. 
Btw they have several kool-aid flavors and the watermelon tastes just like watermelon jolly ranchers! Yummy!!!
Service: wonderful! For being so busy everyone was helpful and everything was well done for an opening. \"Rory\" our waiter was AMAZING! Funny, knowledgeable about the food, and full of personality. Loved the music they played too. Stevie Wonder, Blackstreet, Lauryn Hill. What an experience! Also, I gotta say, I appreciated the diversity of people working here. Older, younger, all races and styles. Very pleasant experience, we will be going back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really torn with this place.  My son and I went around 4 pm on a Thursday night and there was only two other tables seated.  We both got chicken and waffles.  Both have good flavor but the chicken is a bit dry and the waffle was limp, soggy and very pale, no crispiness.  Our waitress was very attentive, food came out surprisingly fast. I don't know if the place typically is very busy on a Thursday, but they had way to many employees just walking around doing nothing.  I went back with a party of 3 today for breakfast (9:30 am ish), the place was packed but we were seated within 5 minutes. Wait for food was a tad bit longer, but nothing to really complain about - if I wanted fast food I would go somewhere else right?  This time I ordered the red velvet pancakes, it comes with 3 pancakes - plate size, couldn't finish them.  They have a lemon/cream cheese drizzle on the top that I didn't really care for, the pancakes were moist.  Both times I have gone the music is very loud and people are talking very loud just to be heard over the music.  The place is good, not as good as the hype, I would go back."}
{"text":"I love the coolaid!  Also the hot biscuits with butter! Yummo!  We love everything here."}
{"text":"Catfish....fried chicken....season potatoes were dee_lish. Our waiter was cool and frirndly she told us what to expect...service was quick and fresh. Some items were cold and the mac and cheese was nasty."}
{"text":"Don't order take out.  I just got home with a $14.00 \"Vibe\" salad which was supposed to be romaine lettuce. When I got home I discovered my salad was made with field greens which I hate.  The size and look of the salad was more like a tiny side salad you get at Wendy's for $4.00!   I called and the manager on duty and he told me I could come back and get another salad.  Well at 5:00 at night and living more than 8 miles away that is the last thing I wanted to do.  He then took my name and said I could come in at another time and get the correct salad.  Allot of good that does me now!  $14.00 plus tip in the garbage and I get a PB&J for dinner.   Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic turn around from my last visit.  
Noon on a Wednesday, no wait time, just walked in and was sat at a both immediately. 
The server was knowledgeable about the menu, made great recommendations, the 4 employees that spoke to us we're professional and friendly. Our drinks arrived almost immediately after we ordered them and they serve alcohol now. 
They have large portions and we ended up ordering more food than we could eat, it was all really delicious and served hot. 
I'm glad I gave this spot a second chance because everything was outstanding! Great job, keep it up."}
{"text":"Chicken definitely does not look like what's on the menu but was decent in taste.  Blue raspberry kool aid and red velvet cake are delicious!.  Note: If there are more than one person in your party you will have to wait until everyone in your group is there to be seated."}
{"text":"The only dish I've had is the shrimp and grits at one point I was coming here at least three times a week. Love the kool-aid"}
{"text":"The food is good in this place ! Chicken and catfish  were well seasoned and juicy! Mac and cheese was just ok, but corn bread is really good ! As I said the food is good but the service needs to be better ! We went there with my wife in Friday night and it was busy so the server tried to send us out as fast as she could! 5 minutes after she dropped  the food she came back with the to go box and the check ! We wanted to order a dessert, but after seeing that we changed our mind ! Anyways we will go back there one more time just because of the food, lol!"}
{"text":"I Brought my wife here for Mother's Day...was surprised at first by how quiet it was given the day we were here but when we left it was clear why ...Still can't decide which was worst, the food or the service but needless to say I won't be coming back to this place again!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok... Welcome to Las Vegas. .. Finally a good soul food eatery. ..my entrée was very appetizing and I also enjoyed watching all the other entrée orders...I wish I had an endless stomach because I want to try several menu selections...they have the best soft chewy waffles....be prepared to wait they are super busy...great job!"}
{"text":"The service was slow, which is understandable because the place is new.  There is no call in or take out so the line is inevitable.  After waiting to be seated our food took at least an hour and then was missing things.  They did not have everything on the menu and kept having to substitute because for example mash potatoes weren't done or there was no more French fries.  Then there was no banana pudding or red velvet cake left either and it was 3pm.  The chicken was very good and cooked just right as well as mainly of the other dishes.  Most of the problems are easily fixed and maybe after the place is own a little longer they will make sure they keep the sides on deck and always have the desserts.  I liked the kool aide but my family thought it was too sweet.  Over all I would come back, but I hope the staff can do a quicker job at taking orders and seating people and the owners keep stuff in stock."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to this place after it has been shut down but the health department and the service was terrible! Once we were seated,  it took the server a very long time to take drink orders and bring our beverages to the table. After 20 minutes she came back to take our food order. We were waiting for our food to come for a little over an hour a half while being told our food was \"coming out next\" or \" I'll go check\". We asked what was taking so long and the server response was that \"the kitchen just got a bunch of tickets the were put in ahead of us\" AFTER we were already waiting for more than a hour and a half. Our server had no sense of urgency to get our food to us or to even try to make something happen, she never came back to refill our beverages, and also payed no attention to us unless we got up to find her or ask another server to grab her.

  I will not recommend going to this place unless you like terrible service or plan on being there for your server's whole work shift!"}
{"text":"If you like waffles, order them. If you want good chicken, go someplace else. Unfortunately,  the chicken is super dry and not seasoned. What a let down. It took longer than normal to receive our food. Especially for a Wednesday evening. It's pretty expensive for what you get as well."}
{"text":"I have always loved Lo-los for many years. I have been to the Phoenix and Scottsdale location many times and have always had good experiences.

My friends live in Gilbert and have been dying to go. It was not a great experience and hopefully when they have been open for awhile it will be better.

They told us the wait was 15 minutes but it ended up being 35 minutes. Then when we ordered our food it didn't come for about 45 minutes to an hour. 
I don't think out waitress really knew what she was doing . I order a have sweet half unsweet tea but got an arnold palmer which was overly sweet.
My friend enjoyed their alcoholic beverages.

When they brought our orders everything was not the way it was supposed to be.
I ordered the sampler with a breast and a piece of catfish. I got a wing, so they had to exchange it.
One of my friends ordered the same but she only got one of her sides.
Then my other friend got only one piece of chicken but they forgot her catfish.
It took them 25 to bring my friend her french fries. My friends macaroni was cold
The waitress apologized for that but nothing else.
The manager should have came and said something because it was all messed up.
The soda was flat.
My sister loved the banana pudding.
The food was good and thus hopefully it will get better"}
{"text":"Some of the best soul food and fried chicken I've ever had! I grew up in a major city in the Midwest known for its soul food and chicken. This place is it! 

A family member I went to the restaurant with had chicken gizzards and he said they were some of the best he's ever had. They were so fresh that he wasn't sure they were gizzards. 

We also had the fried chicken, potatoes, Mac n cheese, green beans/potatoes, buttered corn, and beans and rice. Everything was cooked and prepared very well! Our orders came out quickly and everything was correct as ordered.

Service was extraordinary with our waitress was very attentive. I will definitely be coming back and the family I went with raved about Lo Lo's as well."}
{"text":"The service was good and attentive.  I ordered the recommended LoLs (#3) and it was just OK... the waffles weren't as hot as if they had been freshly made and the chicken was not as crispy as would be expected for \"Southern Fried\"... the sautéed spinach was great but unfortunately the main dish was just so-so...  I was hoping to have the same experience I had years back with the original LoLo's in South Phx."}
{"text":"First time in the area, was told this was comparable to Roscoes in Los Angeles... So I had to try it! OMG! I loved it! They had koolaid, I got red! 

I ordered a chicken breast and a waffle, Mac and cheese and a biscuit with gravy .... It was all amazing! Our server was on top of everything, checked in, kept the koolaid coming lol! My friends also really enjoyed their food, one got stupid fries, they were amazing!
Food is very filling and big portions ... Didn't eat all day, the deserts also looked awesome, next time! 
The wait they said was going to be 45min but was only about 20min, the wait for the food was not too long,but not apposed to waiting for great food.

I'll be back in the future when visiting."}
{"text":"I've had chicken, and I've had waffles. This is the first time I've had chicken and waffles. It's an interesting combination, but not something I'm fully down with yet haha. The portions here are pretty big. Either come with a big appetite or be prepared to take food home. My friend said the wings here are the equivalent of two wings because the halves are not separated. We all walked away very full. However, the food isn't stellar. The chicken was pretty dry and the waffles were soggy. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese, which I felt was too much cheese and not enough macaroni. Service is pretty great, but our waitress could not remember our orders. They brought us the correct chicken pieces as extra though to make up for it. The place is definitely good for a fun time."}
{"text":"Second time here, both times had to wait 30 minutes just for them to come and take our drink order. And a rat just ran across the restaurant!!! not coming back!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. The food and drinks were phenomenal. I would definitely recommend this place and hope to make it back. Seeing Kevin Johnson was pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after a couples massage with my boyfriend and we decided on Carry-Out, the Shrimp & Grits are TO DIE FOR! Perfectly seasoned, fried to perfection and did I mention TO DIE FOR! We def will be back here and will also bring family and friends who visit in town!!!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday (two weeks after they opened). We figured they would have all the kinks out that some people were talking about. NOPE! First off they don't have their liquor license yet. I'm okay with that. My husband ordered the KK and I ordered a burger (well done). When we got our food the first thing I notice was my fries were cold. My husband's waffles and chicken were cold too. We didn't want to complain so we just started to eat. Well I always cut my burger when I ask for well done and it wasn't well done. I also asked for no tomatoes but it was on there. I asked if she could have them redo my burger...20 minutes later no burger..my husband was done with his food and I was just over it. They need more servers. They have A LOT of bus people but need more servers. The manager was called out three times before we left. We spoke with the manager and he stated he would take off the burger and bring our ticket. 15  minutes later no ticket. Our waitress comes and tells us that he just said everything was on the house because of the burger. That would have been good to know like 10 minutes ago. All in all I am going to give this place 3 more months to get the kinks out before I go back."}
{"text":"Holy damn, this was good!  I ordered the three piece chicken with gravy and onions and two waffles.

Gravy, GOOOOOOD. Chicken, GOOOOD. Waffles, GOOOOOD.

We also got the fried mushrooms and fried catfish which for whatever reason came out way after the rest of the meal but whatever. Delicious as well.

There was a 40 minute wait, and frankly I think the whole place is over priced, but its kind of a novelty restaurant, so it's expected.

Go at happy hour. Appetizers are $2 off. 

YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM"}
{"text":"Ugh! We've been in a handful of times. They never have the food I want. Not sure if they need to redo the menu or if the kitchen runs out or ???? The last time we went to Lolo's, we waited an hour for a table even though MOST of the tables were empty. Then we waited an hour for our food. We have 4 kids and it was not a fun outing. I think they tried to make it up to us by offering a free dessert but then we waited another 30 min for that. Not sure what was going on. 

I'm not really a fan of the food. Waffles are very thin. Most vegetables taste like they came out of a can.  Fun concept and it's nice to have something different to choose from but I don't think we'll be returning again."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place after seeing some bad reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. Even though it was busy on a Saturday around lunch time, we were able to be seated right away. The portion of my husband's biscuits and gravy was huge!!! We could have shared it!! My chicken and waffles were awesome and even the smaller portion I ordered was plenty!

Huge shoutout to our server Janea!!! She was attentive and very friendly. 

Great experience and I would go back. I only hope our next time won't be disappointing!!"}
{"text":"I think the expansion is killing this Resturant .  Arrived Tuesday about 6:50 pm  there was people waiting to be seated while 7 to 8 tables were wide open.  Put in our name was told a 20 minute wait, we said we would be at the bar. At the bar ordered a beer and waited and waited while 7 to 8 tables remained clean and open.  Finally after 35 minutes we were sat at a table that was clean and open the entire 35 minutes. We knew what we wanted, we read the menu at the bar for last 35 minutes and ordered at being seated. So now another 30 minute wait for 2 pieces of chicken, waffle, and a side.  Sadly, waffle only slightly cooked raw in center, chicken over cooked, and side not very good. When they had 1 Resturant downtown Phoenix food and service much better."}
{"text":"Been to the LoLo's in Arizona. Had to check out the Vegas location. Did not disappoint. Had the Tre-Tre. And a side of grits and green apple Kool aid. Didn't even know there was a Kool aid flavor like that. I definitely needed a nap afterwards. Loved it."}
{"text":"Great food, my mom had the shrimp and grits and they were delightful and l so was the catfish that I ordered with the mac n cheese and collards. Love the food, but the customer service needs work."}
{"text":"Every time we come here it's literally the worst service. Getting drinks wrong table, not being seen to order drinks after being sat down at our table for a while. It's good food though. Only reason we came back because of the food hoping service would change. Still horrible service but good food. Definitely not coming back though"}
{"text":"I'm probably beating a dead horse with this review but I need some relief from the disappointment I feel when I think about my visit here on 2/6/2016 - so I'm gonna take it out on the horse. 

I heard about the long waits, so I decided to come mid-day to possibly get seated faster. Nope. Took an hour to sit TWO people and a toddler. I knew that I was going to wait no matter what when I arrived and they were frantically writing everyone's name on a notepad like they we're a journalist  jotting down fresh ideas. 

After an hour of waiting even though they said it would be 30 minutes we finally get seated. Me and my sister asked the waiter a few simple questions but he didn't know the differences in the combo meals. I felt like I was answering my own questions. (All good, It just opened I understood) but when asked what plates are more filling, he was clueless - that was a question I couldn't answer myself -- but ultimately we made sense of it and ordered. 

30 minutes go by and we begin to see people looking just as clueless as to where their order is as we were. The people who started verbally complaining began to get their orders.  I would have jumped on that train if I could've found my waiter. 40 minutes went by before he whizzed past our table and said \"foods coming\" without stopping.  We finally catch him 10 minutes later and ask him \"what's up, man?\" He goes back to the kitchen. Another lady comes and tells us \"It's coming\". Finally after an HOUR the food comes... Freezing COLD. The waffle was soggy and COLD. Fries COLD. Okra COLD. The fish and chicken were the only two somewhat warm items. The chicken appeared to be friend a bit long  but was still good. (Heads up, the chicken is the only positive thing in this review) The catfish was flat out was rubbish. I've had better fish at Golden Corrals buffet. Mind you we are with a toddler who hadn't gotten their food yet. Her plate came out 5 minutes after ours. So I ate cold food with a crying a baby for the first part of the meal. Thanks Lolo's. 

Another waiter passed by and asked \"how was everything?\"
 -everything was cold
 Sir, why didn't you send it back? 
 - I don't think I could have lasted another hour waiting. 
He gave me a look like, \"touché\"

I don't know if I will ever return here, that's something for me and my love for fried chicken to figure out but If I do they will definitely have to wait like they made me wait. So maybe next year. Hopefully they have it together by then."}
{"text":"So this experience was like an episode of Amy's Baking Company on Hell's Kitchen! Only difference was the Manager was a man and screamed a bit louder than Amy. This manager also likes to keep tips. I heard him tell one of his wait staff \"to bad you forgot to enter your tip and now I'm keeping it\".  Oh and let's not forget the customer he was arguing with. He was disrespectful and very rude to her. She was offended so much that she told him she was filing a harassment complaint  with the Gilbert Police Department aginst him. So if you would like some drama  dinner theater with your chicken and waffles this is the place to go. Oh and as for the food. Couldn't tell you nothing about it. We left with out ordering."}
{"text":"I guess I was spoiled with the real deal at Mama E's in Oklahoma city.  The service was super slow, food quality was poor.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Wanted to come check it out, see what it was all about! I had the two wings and waffle, my boyfriend got the shrimp and grits. Both were very good.  The shrimp were bigger than we thought. Which was a plus"}
{"text":"Was super excited to see my sister had a chicken and waffle place by her house. I come from California where we have the original Roscoe's, the creator of fried chicken and waffles. So maybe I'm a little spoiled. In comparison, there is no comparison, roscoe's wins. 

There was a bit of a wait so my cousin and I ordered Bacon Bloody Mary's, they were served up in a Mason jar and were on point. We were seated in a booth and our nice waitress took our drink orders. I got a Georgia On My Mind, yum. I will try to recreate this at home. We placed our food orders, I opted for the Betty's Boob. A fried chicken breast and waffle. And added a side of coleslaw. 

It took awhile for us to get our food, but our waitress kept checking with us and apologized for the kitchen being behind. Our food came out all right, except she forgot our sides but promptly got them. The chicken was nice and crispy, but the waffles were soggy.  They needed to be a little more crispy. Now for the sides. My side of coleslaw cost too much for the size it was, it should be half the price for the amount given. But it was done perfectly. The Mac and cheese my sister got was tasty, but the pasta was overdone giving it a mushy texture. 

Our waitress split our bill for us and we were on our way. I was full for the rest of the day. Not bad, but not fabulous either."}
{"text":"Don't come here for great service. Come here to eat the most unhealthy delicious fattening meal you will eat all year! They have THE BEST fried chicken and waffles. Better than Roscoes in LA. If you are craving this combo, this is the place to come to. Also, if you are questioning this combo, you have to just try it to understand its amazingness."}
{"text":"We will never return! Upon being seated we were greeted immediately and our drink orders were taken. We ordered our food mostly by recommendation of our sever. Our food came pretty quickly. That's where the good stuff ends. 
My food (Uncle Brotha's Shrimp and Grits). One word...GREASY!! I could barely eat it. The shrimp was literally swimming in grease. 
My daughter ordered the Lo-Lo. It was three pieces of fried chicken & two waffles. The waffles were soggy and the chicken was too. No crisp, no seasoning. She had one wing and a few bites of her waffles. 
My husband had the Pick 3 for $20. He had the catfish beignets, fried green tomatoes & chicken gizzards. He barely took a bite of each and said they were all disgusting. 
When the food was dropped off we asked the server for an extra plate, some sliced onions and I had ordered an extra piece of catfish. We had to ask a bus boy for the extra plate and never saw the onions or the extra piece of fish. Not ONCE did the server come by to ask how the food was, refill our drinks or check on us. We had to wave him down to get our check. 

Bad food and bad service!! We won't ever spend another cent at Lo-Lo."}
{"text":"Two words, irritating and disappointing.
My friends and I went here because she highly recommended this restaurant and said how great it was. Even though it was slow , It took 45 minutes for our food to arrive, she messed up the order about 5 times before actually getting it right and she kept forgetting half of our order, I shouldn't have to remind my waitress of the food that I already put in the order for. Other people that arrived after us got their food before we even did, I am never recommending this place nor will i ever come back. I am also in the customer service industry so seeing this kind of behavior really does piss me off and is unacceptable, as a paying customer i did expect great service."}
{"text":"Will not be back.

The good- ice tea and corn fritters

The bad- catfish had no flavor except for the horrible taste of belly meat that is a sign of cheap fish. That can often be made up for with some good seasoning. This had no seasoning. I grew up in Mississippi. We know our catfish. Boyfriends chicken tenders were dry and flavorless just like the fish. 

Our server was excellent. I'm sorry he has to work in a place with such horrible food. He did take our entrees off when he saw we barely touched them. We made sure to tip him well, not his fault the food is crap. 

Sorry lolo, what you served was an insult to this southern boy."}
{"text":"I thought their food was fantastic! Very fresh. I read all the horror stories about how unorganized the service was but I didn't see a problem as I came right during opening on Saturday morning."}
{"text":"If you know where the Mason-Dickson line is and care to transport yourself SOUTH of it then this may be the place for you. Trendy mason jars are used for beverages. Frankly, my dear, I don't give a daxn for the carb load. Tommy wants you to remember his name and service, so I did. I also enjoyed the boomer vintage music and the patio view of Superstition mountain that is unusual from downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"It would have been great if the Manager wasn't screaming at his staff. We came later in the evening and we recieced each part of the meal separately about 10 minutes apart. I came back the next day hoping it would be a better experience(different staff). Nope! We sat at the bar area and the bartender was the server (I guess). Unfortunately we ended up with 3 different servers. Typical Las Vegas hood place with sparkle. 

Food was no where near the level of Roscoes or any other place that serves chicken and waffles...

Avoid if possible!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do don't visit this location. The originals in Scottsdale & Phoenix do very well, for a reason. They're fully staffed and know what they're doing. Not having what's on your menu in stock or being fully staffed is restaurant 101 & this place continues to have these issues. Only place in downtown Gilbert without a wait on a Saturday night which is obviously a red flag."}
{"text":"I really have no words that could do this place justice! The food is ridiculously amazing! Eaten there twice and ordered something different both times. The portion sizes are huge!!! MAKE SURE you order the cornbread, the okra and the fried green tomatoes! All of the chicken is PERFECT and the grits are stupid good. I could go on and on and on......JUST QUIT READING THIS AND GO EAT THERE!!!! The only requirement is that you LOVE true southern food!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I'll definitely  be back.  

Our group sat in the bar area and the bartender waited on us.  

We had chicken, waffles, catfish and grits. 

Everything was cooked perfectly and delicious."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Tiny was a great waitress. She was very nice and always had a big smile. My brother, his mother and myself spent all Sunday cleaning and running errands, this made our day. And to have tiny as our waitress made it better."}
{"text":"I have ordered food from here several times when they first opened and the food was great compared to now. Back then I was obsessed with their banana pudding - the best to me by far. 

Today we ordered food for the office and got the banana pudding. I hate to admit it but, we were not impressed!! Definitely not the same quality and quantity of food as before. It's very unfortunate. I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"I came here the first Sunday after they opened.  That being said it was obviously crowded, and I knew there was going to be a wait because friends had gone the night before so I went in with patience.  There was five of us total.  We arrived around 1 o'clock and were lucky enough to find seating at the bar.  They don't have their liquor license yet so between us ice tea and diet soda was ordered. We did have the option to eat at the bar but we preferred waiting for a table.  After about an hour we checked to see where our name was on the list and apparently it had been called and we missed it.  Considering how crowded it was and the noise level the hostess needs to make a better effort of calling out names or getting some sort of mic system.  We had just missed it so they sat us next.  This was about 2 o'clock.  Our waitress told us that due to the crowds the wait time from ordering our food to receiving it  would be about 30-35 minutes.  We all ordered immediately since we had an hour at the bar to watch plates come out and peruse the menu.  An hour passed and our food came out.  My table mates were getting a little ancy at this point.  

I ordered the KK's.  Three pieces of chicken, two waffles, two eggs and grits.  The chicken is fried to perfection but also perfectly juicy.  I ordered it with breast, thigh, and wing, but it came with two wings, so not sure if I got lucky or if that's the way it comes out.  Can't go wrong with scrambled eggs with cheese and onions.  The grits were a little watery but not a deal breaker.  The waffles had a cinnamon flavor to them that I also enjoyed.  Someone else at the table commented that they would have preferred more crisp waffles but I think that's a personal preference.  Previous to that I had sampled the fried green tomatoes ordered for the table with a honey mustard type of dip.  Those I would order a again for sure.  The portions are very generous so next time I might change my chicken selection or get a to-go box as I did this time.  

Service was attentive and we learned a little bit about the history of LoLo's.  Because of the wait one of my table mates did ask to speak to a manager and a more than fair discount was given so props to management for being so apologetic about the wait even though it was to be expected.  I will definitely be returning after a few weeks when the crowds die down but most likely not on a Sunday because that appears to be a just out of church crowd which probably even once it dies down those larger parties will continue to flock there on Sundays."}
{"text":"I saw they were opening out here. I am actually amazed, they appear to have opened a great deal of locations since I have been in for some drank, Betty's Boob and greens. 

It was just as I remembered, but even better because I was sad that morning and hadn't had it in forever. So the loss of one star comes in on the seating and hostess. She seemed like a very nice young lady, asked if we would like a seat inside or out. I asked for inside, until we realized we would literally be at the front door. No one wants to come into a place and see some sad girl sitting there. My girlfriend asked to be seated outside, it was a beautiful day and the sun was shining. Now, I suppose there are certain areas they seat because of servers or how busy it is. Mind you, there was a pretty steady crowd but there was also plenty of sunny spots on the patio to soak up that vitamin D. 

Instead, we were seated in the cold corner area in the shade. I know we could have requested to be else where but come on, that ain't me, sit the sad girl in the corner, I totally get it. 

Our server, Faith, was totally awesome! She was super friendly, felt like she was reading my mind. My girlfriend went with the bottomless mimosa which was a stellar deal. I was a bit shocked they served alcohol and had a bar, I don't think I realized they did although again, it's been awhile. She twisted my arm and I had a single mimosa and Faith returned and new I wanted some red drank. Oh man, it's so good! I am sure in previous reviews I mention they make it just how my momma never let me. 

Mmmm, the chicken and waffle, why is this such an awesome combination? Oh, the greens warm my soul. Initially we were out for brunch but the Universe knew I needed love for my soul and I am so glad I got it. The flavor on the chicken is delicious and I want to eat every crispy piece of skin there is. The waffle, I don't know if it's a dash of cinnamon or the perfect thickness but on point and in my mind automatically qualified it as brunch. I wish I could get my greens to taste like theirs, I don't even know. Obviously, I haven't learned to do it like they do and I can't even imagine or pinpoint what the flavors are exactly apart from delicious. 

The manager cane out to check and see how we were, which is always a nice thing to know that someone is close by and paying attention. He probably would have moved us if we asked but I liked the server. 

Anyhow, took a plate for the dude and hope he enjoyed it as much as I did because I haven't been able to get him to go in with me... 

I live LoLos and am glad to see they're doing well for themselves. It was just a converted house downtown and I believe they were some how related to Mrs. Whites. I also miss that place. Anyhow, give it a try your soul will thank you for it."}
{"text":"I had heard all of the hype about this place. My friends said it was not worth it. For a place that has chicken and waffles in the name, the chicken was fried right but not much flavor. The waffles tasted reheated. Eggo's may have been a upgrade. Corn bread was very good. We waited an hour and a half. They are still a new location and we will try again at some point to see how it averages. For a wait that long, they have to be doing something right."}
{"text":"I'll  get straight to the point ...GO HERE FOR THE FRIED CHICKEN...it's good, and it's at the kitchens' discretion what pieces you get...special requests are an additional  $4.00...lucky me, I prefer thighs over breasts, and that's what I got! 

Waffles need work...oh, lose the cinnamon too...French Toast? yes, in the waffles?  No...I like waffles with a crisp outside. Not a fan of Lo-Lo's version. Tasted like a cinnamon pancake in the form of a waffle. YUCK!

Sis in law ordered a side of mac and cheese to try, and it wasn't all that...Cornbread was huge, but dry...avoid

Kool-Aid on tap is cool, but ask for water...all flavors are on the sweet side...service was pretty good, aside from taking forever to bring more napkins, and make  sure that you know the Kool-Aid flavors! Asked for Watermelon and she gives me a Green Apple!?!?
Give Lo-Lo's a try if you're ever in the area!  ALOHA!!!

Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  3"}
{"text":"If you know what real soul food is, then don't come to Lo-Lo's in Gilbert. I hope the real Lo-Lo's is as good as they say because this was not. It was obvious that none of the food was fresh just by looking at it. There was little or no seasoning and some food was under cooked. I gave a 2 instead of 1 because the staff was friendly and it was a nice environment."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever! We checked in online where it showed a 15 minute wait. When we arrived 10 minutes later the hostess told us we'd have a 30+ minute wait because they don't use their online check-in but we could sit at the bar or high top if there was open seats. We found two seats at the high top, I went and told the hostess we'd take those. She said great and she'd take us off the list. After about 10 minutes she sat a couple next to us and brought them menus. I asked if we could please get menus. She responded by telling me she didn't know who seated us there and that was why we didn't have menus. When I tried to tell her she told us we could sit there she walked away. We've gone to the Phoenix and Scottsdale locations for years and always had great service. This location has terrible service and rude employees, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"We waited until this weekend to go to the Gilbert Lolo's. We were concerned about the negative reviews but finally decided to give it a try. It was pretty full but we were seated immediately. Our order was ready quickly and everything was up to the standard of the Scottsdale location that we were used to. We were very happy with the food and service and are looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Fast service (it was a wednesday at 11am) great server (Gabby on the patio) and an amazing menu! Enjoyed the Little C & my husband had the Betty Boob- both perfect portions and only $8 each. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a few days ago because I was craving a number 8 and some cheese grits  
Let me say yes lord!! Always get great food with even better service when I go to lolos. I had Ravin as my server this time and she did amazing. Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"My family and dined  here while vacationing in Las Vegas.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  It's definitely a place to go for some good chicken n Waffles.  My husband had a side of fried green tomatoes and I had the Grits.  They both were very good.  Grandson's enjoyed their grape kool aid too.  The service was top notch .  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's a great place for some soul food. That's what I was in the mood for. Fried chicken was on point and the macaroni and cheese...BOMB! I've tried their grits and greens in the past and they were great too. This is definitely the place to go to for some fried chicken. You've also got to try their candy yams...woooo! The service, it was okay. The hostess, kinda rude. If I was a jerk I would've definitely put her on blast. We were standing in front of her waiting to be acknowledged. After about 2 minutes we finally got a \"hello\". The server, he wasn't rude but he wasn't very attentive. Never filled our drinks, didn't check on us and the place wasn't that busy. I'm sure we could've dipped out without paying our bill and he wouldn't have a clue...haha. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Low quality food. Waffles too thin and limp. Priced high. I didnt like it. If your going to charge a premium price that is fine but have the high quality batters and make sure waffles isnt wet (soggy). Come on."}
{"text":"My family went to Lolos in Gilbert for my sons 11th birthday he picked the location and we had always have had a great experience there before.
I had called ahead and asked for a reservations, Jordan said they dont take reservations but would note it was a party of 9 that was coming. Also told them it was for a birthday. When we got there we had to wait about 15 minutes which was reasonable.
It started going downhill once we got seated. Our waiter said he would be with us in a minute, it took 10 minutes before he came back and took our drinks order. Our drinks came but staggered over 10 minutes, some of the kids in our party got their drinks then 5 minutes later the rest did. The adult drinks came out a couple at a time. 
We ordered our food and then nothing,I joked that our waiter took our order on a napkin which we thought was strange. Our waiter barely came by, 40 minutes after we ordered we were told our food would come out shortly, it was another 20 minutes later before our food came out. 
By this time it was 8.30, we did our best to keep 3 kids under 11 entertained but we were all getting a little hangry.
It gets worse when our food finally arrived. First we had 2 orders of biscuits and gravy in our party the gravy was great, however the biscuits were rock hard like they have been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour we sent them back. My moms omelette was cold and the vegetables seemed under cooked, she said it was like it had been sitting out for a while not under a heat lamp. They forget 1 of the kids Oreo pancakes, it was 20 minutes later and they still had not brought it out. Then a teenager who was bringing out the food said sorry and brought him a Mac n cheese to tied him over. The pancakes never came and we ended up telling our waiter to cancel it off the order. My wifes order never came out 20 minutes later we told our waiter to cancel the order.  My 22 year old daughter had plans to meet friends, she was waiting for 80 minutes for her food, 20 minutes after every ones food came out. She said she was going to get something with her friends and we told the waiter to cancel that order. 5 minutes later her food came out, we sent it back.

All this time we were never seen by a manager. You would think sending back 2 food items and cancelling 2 other orders this is $50 worth of food a waiter would of had to explain to a manager the situation. Seems like they could careless we never got an apology, my family used to love going to Lolo's we would bring out of towners here, but we wont be back, the problems here seem to be the whole restaurant, the waiter was poor, the kitchen was poor, the food was poor and Lolo's managers dont care. My son had a great Birthday despite Lolo's lack of support."}
{"text":"I've eaten her abt 3 times but only dined in once. Customer service isn't bad but always just below substandard. 
Employees appears to not be fully trained. Almost seems like they're unsure of themselves or overwhelmed... even when not busy. One young black male, maybe early to mid 20s. Worked the front counter and you could tell he was confident & knowledgable. He was pleasant & actually explained what a particular dish was. 
The one time I dined in, the waitress kept forgetting small things ie biscuit, to refill our water, etc. When she handed us our check, she actually stood at our table to wait for us to sign the check. I was there w/a old friend that was here from out of town so we were chatting away. We looked up and I reminded the waitress again that we needed togo containers. It was extremely awards & a lil embarrassing that two 43yo women were treated as if we were going to dine & dash. 
Food is good. I'm in love w/the shrimp & grits so it's pretty much all that I've ever ordered. I think my friend ordered a meat dish (sorry, can't remember which one) but she enjoyed it. 
What prompted me to write this review is bc Sunday, I called to see if they will be accepting reservations for Father's Day (requested by my son). The business was open but no one answered so the message asked to leave a message. I left a full message w/my ques, name & return tel# but didn't get a call back. Called again on Mon. A young lady answer & when I asked the ques her response was, \"the manager is busy, can u call back?\" Now, how in the heck & I supposed to know when the mgr isn't busy? o_@ Again, staff seems new to the restaurant/customer service business so I jus asked if she could take my name & number then call back w/a response. That was abt 2pm on Monday. It's now Tue and I honestly don't believe I'll get a response. 
I love supporting black own businesses bc if we don't, who will but I will not sacrifice my dining experience w/subpar customer service. They've been open long enough to hav things running smoothly now. 
Customer services gets 1 star.
Food gets 3 stars."}
{"text":"A friend of mine has been going on about this place for a long time and with my daughter's fairly recent discovery of the popular chicken and waffles combo, we finally decided to give it a try. We went to the Gilbert location and the restaurant is decorated great. I've read the other reviews and maybe we caught them on a good day but we were seated right away, had drinks in under 3 minutes, ample to time to review/order, and the food was out about 10 minutes later. My daughter had the chicken tenders and waffles and I had the \"DD\"...two breasts and a waffle. I think with this kind of breading, the key is a little longer in the fryer which is how mine was. I ate everything I possibly could...this chicken is amazing and the spice in the breading was unbelievable! My daughter's tenders weren't quite as crispy and the breading was a little more bland...she was fighting me for mine. The waffle was great also, perfectly cooked. Also, enjoyed all the family photos on the walls depicting the start of the business. Next time we're in Gilbert, will definitely be back! Very well worth the stop!"}
{"text":"We stopped by tonight to enjoy an early dinner. I can tell that they are still working out some issues with the  servers and kitchen just because of the way things came out. I ordered chicken and waffles and that came out first then the kids meals and my husbands dinner was last. We ordered a few extra side dishes that were yummy sautéed spinach, fried okra , Mac and cheese, and beans and rice. I had the blue Kool-Aid it was yummy.  Actually I ordered Apple the green Kool-Aid but they didn't have it. We all just tried different items to get a feel for the menu. We really enjoyed everything we had. Chicken was good but not fabulous. Missing some seasoning to me. But it was cooked to perfection!  My husband was very happy with the bill family of four under $50. It never happens! And the kids meal a good size!"}
{"text":"The WORST I've ever had....The Grits were runny with no flavor the Waffle taste like cardboard, the Chicken taste like cooked flour....I was very upset that they would charge anyone for that nasty food."}
{"text":"Now any place that has chicken and waffles in the name already has a number one fan in me. The restaurant was very well put together, clean, and very cute. I liked the family pictures on the wall, it added a nice touch of soul and provided a more southern feeling.  I'm from Oklahoma so coming to Las Vegas and seeing things like that was very homey for me. Anyways it was the Saturday before Halloween and the place was not crowded AT ALL. We got sat immediately in a comfortable booth. Now I won't lie it took a little bit for us to get addressed by a server but our server (Jael possible?) was so nice and attentive we forgot all about that.
 

We were recommended by a friend, and she said the chicken and waffles and koolaid were the best. So that's exactly what we ordered. My friend ordered the watermelon koolaid and I ordered the fruit punch and a Tre- Tre with a side of mac and cheese for us to share. They came out in huge mason jars! So delicious. Not exactly like mama makes it but close enough. Whats funny is is that the server said most people cant get through on jar because its so sweet. (she has never met my sweet tooth obviously because I had two). Our food arrived shortly after that (minus the mac and cheese which we actually forgot about when we tasted our food). Man! That waffle was so crispy on the outside but soft and light in the inside. The syrup they gave us just soaked into the waffle perfect. That with the crispyness and saltiness of the drumstick just made my entire night so worth it. I was so engulfed in my chicken and waffles I actually forgot about the mac and cheese until our server brought over two complimentary because we had to wait so long! WOW. After both of our plates were demolished we just sat back and sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction. We kept looking st the menu to see what we were going to order the next time we come. That's how good it was. Superb service, great food at a decent price. (both our meal combined was 22.00). TOTAL THUMBS UP IN MY BOOK!!"}
{"text":"They just can not get scrambled eggs right, I specifically requested eggs scrambled very soft, and I got bricks."}
{"text":"First time finally trying this place after hearing about it for so long. This particular location is very nice! Full bar, plenty of outside and inside seating and very clean. Our waitress was very attentive, top notch service. I ordered the chicken and waffles plate with grape Kool-Aid to drink served in a large mason jar. The chicken was so good! Perfectly crispy and full of flavor. The waffles were great too very flavorful and fresh. Needless to say I'll be back for more. I would recommend this restaurant to my fiends and family."}
{"text":"Never have I ever had such terrible service at Lolos. This was my choice to have my birthday dinner after a long day driving/snowboarding. Yes it was Saturday night and a 45 minute wait is understandable. We continued to wait an additional 35 minutes because the blonde hostess gave away our table to someone else and then tried to put our party of 8 on two small tables. Right when they were about to bus those two tables a more comfortable area opened up and we requested that spot. They finished bussing the table that we wouldn't fit on and sat other people down before addressing the guests that were waiting longer than anyone in the restaurant (us).


They finally got our tables ready after waiting almost double the amount of time we were initially told. We were ushered over by the blonde hostess and given a look of \"are you happy NOW?\"

Then we waited for a long time, I've written all of this post and still no one has come to even say hi.

The blonde hostess continued to give us looks throughout the night.

Then they moved a bunch of tables around and slid the chairs around making a ton of noise, lift the chairs! Everyone in the restaurant was looking around at why so much noise was happening. 

Our waitress came over, finally, and explained that nobody (the hostess) told her we were over here. She was very understanding and listened and made every attempt to make things better.

Some random kind member of the staff came over and asked if we needed a coloring pad for our baby, thoughtful. Then the blonde hostess shuffled over and with attitude once again dropped off the coloring stuff. My question is why didn't she bring that over to begin with, and where was our highchair that we asked for 3 times? We ended up getting one, from our waitress... not the hostess.

In the end, once we didn't have to deal with the blonde hostess we had a good evening. She needs some retraining and to understand that without patrons she doesn't have a job. So treat people better and try to be more accommodating. It was my birthday after all. 

Very sad and disappointed about one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"First time here .. Really enjoyed it ....the food is so good .... I got the kk special . It was 3 pieces of chicken ( fried so darn good ) skin is crispy .white meat is juicy ...eggs were delicious . Grits were awesome ...waffles were great . Did I mention the eggs come with cheese and onions . Prices are very reasonable .... We had a wonderful waitress who was very friendly and interacting with my kids. We. Were a party of 9 and were seated right away. The kool aid was great .. This place deserved the 5 stars.. Will definitely come back again when visiting  Las Vegas . Atmosphere is great . They have Tv and also play good music . This place is 10x better then roscoes chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience at Lo-Lo's on Rainbow in Las Vegas today, December 4th between 10:30 am and 11:50 am. The food is normally ok and I've never had any issues here prior to this date but this time it was bad.. After placing an order for 3, we waited for our food for an hour. The restaurant did not appear to be busy. At this point, we spoke with a manager. I was told that his name is Doug, however he was not wearing a name tag of any sort. After hearing our complaint, Doug said \"I'm getting it out now\" and he walked away. I waited 7 minutes and I was extremely irritated and had lost my appetite so we told our server that we will pay for our drinks but we were leaving. She told us not to worry about the drinks and that she would cancel the order. On the way out, I asked to speak to the manager again. He walked up with an attitude and I told him that we decided to leave, we waited too long, others that had arrived after us were served before us and that this experience was bad. He replied \"I told you it was in the window and coming out and y'all decided to leave so....\". Our server had checked on us after the first time we had spoken with the manager, so if that was true, how long was our food going to be just sitting in the window? Why wasn't it brought to our table?! I told the manager we still continued to wait and that was unacceptable. He replied \"Well if your server put the ticket in late, she put it in late.\" I responded \"What do you mean? You are the manager!\" He then asked \"Well what you want me to do?!\" I couldn't take his unprofessional attitude anymore so I walked off and he did too. Our server, who witnessed all of this, along with a hostess did apologize as we walked out. This manager is by far the worst that I have ever dealt with! The situation was poorly handled and he has a bad attitude. He clearly does not belong in the customer service field. I wasted almost an hour and a half of my morning here and left pissed off! That visit was most likely my last."}
{"text":"Extremely great customer service !!!! Demetria was our server and she was amazing . The staff were all well mannered .Demetria started us off with an amazingly big mason jar of cherry kool-aid, I was in aww already .Flavor was spot on, not too sweet and not sour it was perfect,literally .NOW, let's get to the food,  the Red Velvet pancakes were amazing !!! Light and fluffy and overall satisfying ,with cream cheese frosting ,need I say more . The hot links were just that , Hot Links, juicy with just the right amount of spices . My friend ordered the KK's special and it looked amazing . Came with two waffles ,fried chicken ,grits and scrambled eggs with onions and cheddar cheese . Can you say fulfilling . This place was great and I would be surprised  if it didn't last . They are here to stay and their food is a loud statement of that !!!! I will be visiting again! !"}
{"text":"Everything from the service to food sucked.

Old fried chicken. Cold Mac and cheese. Forgot some of the food and the server sucked. 

Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Yelp. I should have listen to you lol. This place has crappy service. The food was fine. The waitress was nice but she took to long to get the food out, take the check, and bring boxes.The whole time I was sitting at the table I had to listen to a ghetto waitress complain because she didn't get a tip. She was loud and obnoxious. I will not visit this place again."}
{"text":"Service was great... Mac and Cheese was good.... The spinach was GREAT... Smothered chicken was flavorful and tender... I don't eat much in one sitting so plenty of leftovers... Green apple Kool-Aid was good... I will be back again...."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, in my opinion. My boyfriend and I met up with our friends here (a total of 7 of us) and honestly, the only thing that's making me want to not come back is the wait. I mean, I get it it's pretty new so all the hype is there and all, but when other bigger parties are coming in after you and getting seated before you, that's ridiculous. 
We got there at 7pm and finished at 11pm. My friends and I had waited an hour or two to actually get a table, then we were able to order our drinks and food right away, and we waited another hour or so just to get our food. And while we were waiting for our food, other people who had been there a shorter time than us were complaining that they hadn't received their food. The workers there are okay and this experience wouldn't have been worth it if it weren't for our server, Joanne? She made sure we were okay and had told us that things were crazy in the back (which it was pretty insane considering our table had been moved inside and close to the kitchen).

I just feel like this place could have so much potential if everyone knew what was going on. Some of the hostesses were getting frustrated at how busy it got and I'm sure I wasn't the only one who could tell. It seemed like some of the servers didn't know what was going on in the back and the kitchen staff just seemed all over the place. I'll probably come back when things tone down a little."}
{"text":"LoLos Chicken & Waffles had a very nice lunch. Banana Nut pancakes were tender & tasty. Biscuits & Gravy had lots of sausage in gravy. Biscuits nice and fluffy. Wait wasn't bad. We had a zombie drink & an Electric lemonade. They were both good but a little on the higher price point. Amane was our server very attentive. Would've given a 5 star if the prices were worth it. 1 full order of pancakes, side order of biscuits & gravy, 2 drinks w/tip cost us $50. A little steep but we'll be back."}
{"text":"Second time at Lolo's and everything tasted like the food had just been microwaved. The chicken tasted old from the previous night. Also the menu is overpriced. They dont let you sub anything. Coffee is good thgouh."}
{"text":"We finally made it...however, it was a Sunday afternoon so the place was crowded. We waited for over an hour which appeared unnecessary since there were a lot of empty booths and several empty tables next to the bar ( it seems that they need more workers). We eventually chose to sit at the bar. Once seated the service was good. I had the waffle and two wings. The food was great. I will try it again in hopes that they are adequately staffed or that the wait time improves."}
{"text":"Yes!!! Oh yes!!! When I say that I'm a happy customer... I mean it! I had the #7 TOYTOY 2 wings and a waffle. I had Blue kook-aid but also tried the Red. Both were great. Not too sweet or tart. I had a side of sautéed spinach and sweet corn. I sampled my family's plates and everything was amazing. 
Husband had \"CHYNA'S HONEY HOTS\" which is 6 wings splashed with Chyna's honey & hot sauce combo, served with ranch. 

Rosa was our server and did such a lovely job. She was on top of everything we requested and the manager Jeff came over and thanked us for our service after we asked for military discount. That was very nice.

lol the whole place felt welcoming and very clean. The restrooms were clean and well stocked. No complaints what so ever. Oh I would have liked kids nuggets or tenders, pizza, or meatballs on the kids menus...

Wait time to be seated was great and the time from when we placed our order to the time all of the food came out was 7-10min. Portions were huge and I feel like we got our monies worth. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken was awesome and so was the mac & cheese. The menu was huge with all day breakfast and all kinds of variety. Our server Shawntavia was great- super friendly and nice. We can't wait to go back and bring our friends."}
{"text":"Already shut down because of disgusting kitchen . C rating , I'm sure there not advertising that with there new reopening sign out front . Thank God there's a McDonald's next door ."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly service. I'm constantly amazed at how the staff treats you like family every single time! Thank you for being such excellent food to the Valley!"}
{"text":"We tried this place after we were so excited about it opening up. However the experience wasn't something I would recommend to anyone. The greeter gal was the  very sweet and happy upon our arrival. Our server wasn't so great. Our order was nothing out of the ordinary couple deserts for the kiddos, an appetizer dinner for the adults(kid had already eaten). My husband ordered a beer took longer then usual to receive no worries. I ordered a salad asked to substitute the cherry tomatoes out for just a slice or two tomatoes (like what they use for their burgers) was told no substitutes can be made on salads. No worries just skip the tomatoes then I don't want them. Our food arrived and our server came back to let us know \"you're going to hate me but we don't have ranch\" okay no problem do you have honey mustard? \"No.\" I get it is soul food but it's still a restaurant offering salad and chicken..... There needs to be more then balsamic dressing available. Not that dressing is the end of the world but I decided not to have dinner with my family because I didn't have any. My salad did however have those cherry tomatoes I asked specifically not to have. The chicken was extremely salty and I was given a box to bring mine home. I don't plan on going back which is a shame because we truly enjoy dinning at new places. This one just didn't make the cut for our next dinner outing."}
{"text":"5/14/17 Thanks to server #Horizun on my first visit to @loloslasvegas my family enjoyed delicious meals , refreshing drinks and watched the Golden State Warriors win! The atmosphere was wonderful and we were impressed by #Horizun professionalism, customer service and great suggestions... Kool-Aid. I had Shrimp & Grits plus Eggs/cheese & onion and Melon Mojito : ) Our entire party was pleased. I will return. We appreciate #Horizun in Las Vegas, from #ReeWords in Oakland, California"}
{"text":"Reading the reviews I was  ready to go. I got the chicken and waffles. The chicken was okay not to bad , but the waffle was soft and way to much cinnamon on them. I could not even finish it. My friends got the chicken sandwich. It was really good the chicken was soft and juicy and the bacon was cooked just right."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a place that can give great service along with great food, and we found it.  My wife and I wandered in on a Saturday afternoon.  We were seated promptly, and served by Bree.  From first contact, to the \"good-bye, come back again\" everything was superb.

The catfish was a highlight, and the greens were better than my Grandma's (please forgive me).  We had the fried green tomato appetizer and it was amazing (it comes with thousand island dressing....just press \"I believe\" and try it).

Everything is made to order, so I wouldn't suggest this place if you are in a hurry, but having said that, I LOVE their food!  Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out during their grand opening week. We get there around 11:30 on a Tuesday, and the place is already packed. We get seated fairly quickly and the waiter stops to take our order within 5 min. It was all good up until that point. Then minutes go by, and more minutes, and more minutes...no sign of our food at 30 minutes the waiter comes by and tells me some bogus story that my chicken tenders take longer to cook??? Umm, k, I know I went to public school, but that was just insulting. At 45 minutes he comes by and says our order is up next...at 55 minutes we leave, and it was a tough decision because, hey, we waited that long already and now we have to go wait somewhere else. But, that was completely ridiculous. Here's the kicker, they send out a text when they seat you, so there is no way they can deny how long you have been sitting there without your food. Bam. Sorry lolo's we won't be back unless I have half a day to kill..."}
{"text":"The menu prices are too high, they either were too cheap to say what the price was or rounded it up to the next $. Nice inside and that's it. My biscuits were really dry and i had gravy. Tbey give you a ton of potatoes but they were running out of ketchup so i was limited on eating them. I am taking more home to the dog then what i ate. High prices and bad food. Won't be back....$3.50 for a tea.....wtf"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  If you like Southern cooking this is the place.  We used Door dash app for delivery.  It was still hot when it arrived.  The flavor of everything (catfish, chicken, potatoes and gravy, coleslaw, Mac & cheese, and 3 desserts (banana? pudding, peach cobbler, and red velvet cake) perfect.

This was my first time eating Lo Lo's, but it definitely won't be my last.  So happy to find a great Southern restaurant here in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Not impressed with anything that I had.  Uneventful chicken.  The breading would have been better on fish and the waffle was just okay.  One visit was enough."}
{"text":"My family and I met some friends for brunch at the Gilbert, AZ location today and it was one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had. I've worked in the service industry for many years and was so disappointed in our experience. We had four children with us (all under the age of 10) and it took two hours for us to have a meal. The first hour and a half were just waiting for food! The server was trying to bartend and serve us on the patio at a table that she couldn't even see from the bar. It took 20 minutes just to get drinks and we couldn't even get coffee because they ran out of coffee mugs! 

When I went to ask for a manager, I was asked for a reason why. No apologies were given, just the server explaining why none of this was her fault. When the lady, who I can only assume was the manager, arrived at our table she didn't introduce herself or ask how she could help. She just asked if we'd like more drinks. Really? After an hour and a half of sitting there waiting for food with kids who are almost in tears because they are hungry, we couldn't get a proper situation management from her? When we finally got our food, there was no check back with us. We had to track down someone to get our check. Then again had to go to the bar to ask the lady to run our cards. Really, this type of experience is unacceptable and was poorly managed by the staff and manager. I hope that management can really look into operations so that more guests don't experience something like this in the future. 

We enjoy the restaurant's food, but will never return to this location:"}
{"text":"I love the original location. This one needs to work on its service. The chicken is excellent. They have a great breakfast deal of 2 eggs, bacon, grits and a biscuit for $5. Everything else is pretty expensive for breakfast. Charon, my server is excellent. I did not have her on the slower days.

I was very disappointed when I went there on a Wed. for breakfast and they now don't open until 9am M-Th. I understand it is slow, but building a regular following takes time. Liberty down the road is open at 7 and they aren't packed at that time but get full later. The Farmhouse down the street is open at 7 (or earlier) and they have lots of regulars, but not a bunch that early. Please reconsider your hours."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Lo-Lo's for quite some time. I've been waiting a long time for the grand opening of the Gilbert location and tonight was my opportunity to finally grab my favorite chicken sandwich so close to home. 

For an established restaurant I would expect additional locations to hit the ground running successfully but Lo-Los' is a franchise so it looks like this location has a couple bugs to work out before they've got a good grasp on things. It also doesn't help being such a hotspot in 1 horse town. Expected wait time for seating was 30-45 minutes and it took an hour. Expected wait time for food was 30 minutes and that took over an hour as well. My party was hungry and now cold from sitting outside too long so of course that taints atmosphere. 2 hours in waiting and no more tables were being seated so I asked if I can move my party inside and our poor waitress had to inform us that the manager said no-they won't seat outside guests inside. I don't understand why when there's open tables-poor customer service when your already creating a negative vibe. You could tell that the staff were feeling the stress of the upset customers by their lack of patience. 

I'm pretty easy going and I knew it would be a crazy wait but I can see how this will be a turn off for most people. I'd highly suggest giving them a couple of weeks to get the staff trained and comfortable before you rush over to try this potentially great restaurant. For those who love Lo-Lo's and are willing to wait it out hopefully you have some means of entertaining yourself while you wait. 

Now the meat & potatoes - I'm huge fan of their food. My favorite by far is the Phat Azz Sammich. There's a couple different options but you really need to have the chicken. I like the mayo but some people like ranch do your thing. Comes stock with cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomatoes. It's a masterpiece. Tonight's meal wasn't as delectable as the other locations but it was pretty darn good so I know next time I drop then I'll be satisfied. I ordered the stupid fries which are quite stupid! Fries covered in gravy, cheese, chicken bacon and perhaps some other stuff but those are the major portions of the food groups that are important to me. My little girl had the kids mac & cheese with bacon and a chicken strip on the side-pretty good! Mum is boring so she rocked the strips, their home potatoes that had onion and peppers and the coleslaw. Coleslaw wasn't too spectacular so it didn't make the cut. Pappy had some chicken salad in a crazy shaped bowl that threw off his balance. Bowls not symmetrical so he found himself trying to tip it over like jenga but he liked the meal so that's game over. 

Some really great food to be had here but give them a little time to get their bearings. I'm looking forward to revisiting and hopefully revising my review and adding a star or 2. Hats off to our waitress Jai by the way. Had a great attitude and its good to see someone that can handle new business stress so well."}
{"text":"From reading the reviews I was expecting to have a not so great experience. Well, the food was great. The service was exceptional. The overall experience was awesome. I plan to return to this place since there were many choices on the menu that looked appetizing. 

Update...I just got a racist comment from Kram S because he does not agree with my assessment of this business. I am surprised that a person on YELP would make the extra effort to influence an honest review of a business. I am not intimidated by your cyberbullying Mr Kram S!

Wow!!! This wackjob(KRAM S) has started sending me messages making threats and racist comments. Reported and blocked. I never would have expected to have someone verbally attack me because I gave a positive review of a business that they did not like. KRAM S definitely has issues. Hopefully LoLo's bans this guy from their business since he may pose a safety risk not only to the business but the patrons as well..."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 3 star only because of the 1 not so great experience I had today. 

Im a multiple time returning customer, I used to live around the corner for about a year or so and I would visit Lo-Lo's all the time. I've never had a problem with this place until I came in today with my father in law. I was embarrassed because I pumped Lo-Lo's up by telling him, that in my opinion Lo-Lo's was better than Roscoes. 

It all began as soon as we got there, I should've noticed the red flag and turned away today. But I didn't, even after overhearing a gentle grieve over the fact that he called the day before to confirm the restaurant had his credit (in which they said they did). Not to find out that when he returned the following day it was no where to be found. 

When we were finally seated, it took about 17 minutes for the only waitress (Dre or Drai) to address us by saying she would be right with us. The poor thing wasn't able to get back to us until roughly 30 minutes after we were seated to take our order. I asked her if she had any help and she said she was the only one working today. 

So 20-30 minutes after we placed our order our waitress (Dre or Drai) came out to inform us that our grits wouldn't be ready for another 20 minutes. I don't about anyone else but I was raised on grits and they take max 10 Mins to make. So after waiting for our food for 40-50 Mins it finally came out. The waffles were subpar at best this time, but everything else was solid. 

To say the least our waitress was great minus the fact that she didn't have any help for majority of the morning. The manager could've been and should've been way more proactive in helping his employees out. I dont know exactly what he duties are but I'm assuming, ownership wants the guest to have the best experience possible so that they don't leave wanting to write a review like this. 

I would normally suggest Lo-Lo's to all of my friends and family that visit Las Vegas but I'm not sure that I want to send anyone else that way because i don't want to sign off on a place if they're going to continue service of such."}
{"text":"Even on a Monday night, we had to wait a while to be seated from how packed it was, but understandable since they just opened. Reminds me a lot like Roscoes in CA. $8 for the Betty Boob plate, one big juicy chicken breast and 1 waffle. Good food and will be back!"}
{"text":"Fried fish and chicken is good, luv the creativeness with the menu items descriptions.  Zucchini and spinach were fresh and not overcooked. Corn muffin was heavy and had corn pieces in it which isn't my first choice."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever experienced in my life!....we waited over 2 hours for a table for 10 and they weren't even that busy, my kids were starving! I asked for the kids food to be brought out first and of course they brought it out last, I made a complaint to the manager and he gave us 20% off woopty doo smh.....for a wait that long I wish the food was worth it, it was just ok....not sure if it  was truley mediocre or I was way to angry to eat LOL, bad, bad, bad!"}
{"text":"I'm never usually one to write a terrible review, but lolos was just terrible today. I have been here multiple times in the past and was actually quite impressed with it, but today's service and quality of food has made me never want to come back. I talked about this place highly to my parents and finally convinced them to come with me, we get our table and our waitress takes our drink order and takes at least 7 minutes to even come back with our drinks. We ordered our appetizer and entrees and the appetizer came out pretty quickly, when we asked if we could get an extra plate and some refills it took about 5 minutes, just for a plate. We finished our appetizer and then proceeded to wait about 45-50 minutes for our meals. After waiting this period of time, and watching other people that have come in way after us get they're food before ours we asked the manager why our food was taking so long. He said he \"wasn't sure\" and left to go check. He came back to tell us \"they needed fresh chicken breast. Sorry\" as all the other tables around us were getting served chicken breasts. During this whole time our waitress was no where to be found. About 10 minutes later our food finally came and our waffles were soggy like they'd been sitting for a while. My dads piece of chicken was so dry he could really only find 1 bite that was actually edible. About halfway through our meal the manager comes back us and says \"I took %15 of your check. Sorry again\" and it no way did he seem like he was actually sorry that we had such terrible food and service. After almost an hour and half from entering and finishing %15 didn't really mean much to us, our experience was already ruined by that point. There was one gentlemen, who wasn't even our server, come up and ask us how long we had been waiting since he did notice we were there for a while. I didn't get his name, but it's very disappointing when someone who isn't even your server has to notice how long you and your family have been waiting for. With this TERRIBLE service and less than enjoyable food, I can say that we won't be back, and they give us no reason to even want to return."}
{"text":"Fun decor & comfy booths! Tasty fried Chicken & waffles. The sweet tea was really good & very sweet! We went at the best time - no waiting about 4:00. Here's my guy  & special #.1 K K"}
{"text":"Truthfully not worth the awful service. Have been there twice and both times were god awful. No thanks."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious...but the customer service is so terrible I just won't ever return. They screwed up our order big time. When I asked to speak to a manager she shrugged her shoulders and said there was nothing she could do because her shift had just started and she wasn't there when the incident occurred. Seriously?!"}
{"text":"Maybe the waffles are good I wouldn't know as I ordered the blackened fish which was so greasy it was swimming in oil. The mashed potatoes were like paste. Don't expect me to come back."}
{"text":"This place is a very bad chicken and waffles place. I prefer Bruxies chicken and waffles it is located in The Park in The South Strip."}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits was great, the shrimp coating was crisp, the grits buttery and smooth.  Delicious. Fried green tomatoes were perfect.  Banana puddin to die for.
Phat azz sammy was good too.  The wings were just ok, too dry, overcooked, altho the sauce was tasty. The red velvet cake was ok, nothing special.
We will be back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Finally after waiting what seemed like forever I finally got in and they did not disappoint!!!!!! My eyes were bigger than my stomach so I got the K.K. 2 waffles, 1 thigh, 1 breast, 1 wing, grits and eggs with cheese (hold the onions please)!!!!! My boyfriend had the Lo-Lo (everything I had sans the eggs and grits). We both walked out stuffed!!!! The staff was attentive and didn't really bother us unless we needed them. The kool aid was well worth the wait and the Lo-Lo Punch was insane!!! They were kind of short staffed and our waitress was also the bartender. She was awesome!!! I'll definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is exceptional. 

I'm a roscoes chicken and waffle fan, and this is the next best thing.

Friendly staff.

Fast service when I went."}
{"text":"The food is good but inconsistent. I stopped going for a while because the service was so bad, but the last few times more recently have been much better. Hoping they can keep up the service because I really like the food."}
{"text":"With all the great restaurants in this area, it is hard not to get caught up in the relaxing and hip atmosphere of downtown Gilbert. If you are looking more for a loud restaurant that overcharges for lackluster breakfast food, look no further than Lo-Lo's. 
   Our second visit to Lo-Lo's started out better than the first time. But for the life of me I can not figure out why a restaurant that just pops some eggos in the toaster can take so long. (Eggo waffles are actually tastier) once we found a nice black hair in my wife's potatoes that was the breaking point. They were kind enough to comp us for the hairy potatoes, but then allowed thirty minutes to pass before we got the check. Even with a comped meal our bill was 38 bucks! For some koolaid and some dry waffles! Stay home, save your money."}
{"text":"There are some signature Arizona experiences out-of-towners will love you for... Lo-Lo's is one of them.

I want to go 5 stars, but I'm looking for that extra Magic that made the Lo-Lo's of yesteryear transcendent. 

Lo-lo has become a tad gentrified in recent years. When the Gilbert location opened up, I thought for sure my life expectancy was gonna plummet due to multiple Lo-lo's visits per week. Perhaps I should be thankful, that chicken used to own me. But something has changed from the Soulfood perfection of the Phoenix location. Don't get me wrong. It's still quite good and tearing up the competition. But I just remember the glory days when Mrs. White's Son was making it all happen on the corner of Central and Yuma. Larry's hands have left the wheel. I sure hope those glory days return.

It's all about the Chicken. The waffles are damn good as well, but you know what your comin' for... in all its Golden Broasted Juicy Deliciousness.

When I stop in, it's either gonna be Sheeda's Special (A breast, one wing, and a waffle) or lately the Pro Move has been to go with the Famous Soulfood Platter.

With the Platter and just a few bucks more, you get to create your own variation:
Most times I go with
 - Three pieces of Southern Fried goodness (Breast, wing, and thigh)
Sometimes I mix it up with
 - One piece of Catfish & one succulent Breast of chicken
But I always get
 - A waffle and collard greens as my sides
And incredible Cornbread comes with the Platter.

The atmosphere is fun whether you sit inside to watch a game or outside to people-watch the passersby in Downtown Gilbert (the DTG). That last two times I have been served by Jai, who is this personable and amazing blur of efficiency and awesome. The managers/owners must love her because she can run the whole dining area without raisin' a sweat nor a second request from a customer. Not certain what her next move will be, but I'm DAMN sure Jai will be ownin' and runnin' the show somewhere. She's just bound for success.

So, grab that Outa-Towner, some family, or some friends and dig in.

Pro Tip: cut your waffle in fourths, fold a piece like a New York slice and dip it in the syrup ramakin. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My boy friend heard about this love from his coworker and we decided to check them out. This place is huge and the decor was nice. This place was pretty good. The chicken and waffles was delicious. The portions was huge. I couldn't even finish it. They even gave us warm syrup which was a nice touch. The staff was friendly and always checked up on us. They had so many flavors of kool aid. However, they are one the sweeter side. I don't like things that are very sweet, it gives me a headache. I had to mix in water for me to be able to drink it. Overall, we had a good experience and will come back."}
{"text":"Andrea at the bar is awesome! We came in, it was packed and her system went down, but she still managed to make some amazing drinks for us as well as take our food order.  She's a rockstar manning the bar all on her own!! Thank you Lolo's!"}
{"text":"Food is great service sucks..my coffee was cold when they served me, they changed it but it was exactly the same... they took 55mins to bring our food and had to wait 30 more mins because they didn't bring what we had ordered. . And not to mention that we waited 30 min to be seated. ."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place! Service was great. I think our server's name was Kira? She was great. We tried the Lolo's chicken & waffles & Stupid fries.
Both dishes were HUGE portions. Food was great, priced a bit high in my opinion.
Stupid fries were awesome. I thought the c&w were good but I don't prefer chicken with bones. My husband on the other hand LOVED it! He said he can't stop thinking about the food! 
He can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I went back to give it another try and it was worse. I may just be hitting it on the wrong days but the mac&cheese was bad, the grits were watery and the chicken was again flavorless and under cooked.  Overall, I could of had a better, cheaper meal at a waffle house. Will go back to Scottsdale, but not this location."}
{"text":"The food is just ok I was too exited to try this pace out. But the customer service was not so good and the food was not what I expected. And the wait is ridiculous. I will stick to IHOP."}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing service! Our server was really accommodating, had a great personality and made the experience that much better! Pricing was ideal. The only thing a little over priced was the bloody Mary that wasn't that great and $8.50"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for LoLo's in Gilbert. Closer to my home and a brand new building. 

We arrived and were seated at a high top with two groups of two. The group to my right were the first ones to arrive, order and wait, and wait, and wait, the group to our left were the second to arrive place their orders and wait. We were last to arrive,we ordered, received our food before other groups, second group finally received their food, and first group were still waiting for their meal by the time we finished ours. 

Seems each of us had super are wait staff, so that was chaos, I would think that one staff member would have a section of their own. Not 3 wait staff to one high top.

We inquired what the first group ordered. Chicken tenders. Seems they didn't have any prepared and made the customer wait over an hour for for the food. Was it comped? I know some of it was, I think the who table should have been comped and a manager come and explain why we got our food first, being we were the past to arrive, the people on our right waited over and hour, and why 3 different staff members were taken care of one high top.

LoLo's you may think you rule the school yard and act as if we should grateful you arrived in the neighborhood to serve us Kool aid, but I am no longer drinking it, I have more than enough choice on your block to spend my money and receive great service,
Great food, no chaos, and no attitude that I'm the one who should be thrilled they are here. 

I have had a few \"experiences\" at the Scottsdale store, and just wrote it off as being new, working out the kinks, etc, but over the \"years\" it never changed. I still would go when I was craving something but every visit left disappointed. Guess it is really is the LoLo's business model, and not growing pains. Well, you are on Gilbert now, and we won't stand for the same treatment.

You need to learn that customers are the reason you are there, and up the customer service."}
{"text":"Disappointed with service. Went there on a Wednesday night, restaurant was empty-should've been our first red flag-and waited about an hour for food to be brought out after ordering! My first attempt at selecting a dinner, Rotisserie Chicken on the menu and I was told it's no longer being offered! So then,  that item off the menu. Once food arrived, it was brought on tiny plates. Impossible to eat waffles and fried chicken on tiny plates. Quite the mess. I will say that quality of food was tasty! I'm not a fan of waffles, but they were delish! Fried chicken was THE BEST I've had ever. Will this restaurant make it in its present location? Doubt it. Lolo's needs to step it up with service and speed. Nobody has that much time to spend waiting for food to arrive. Will I come back? Most likely not. Tried it, liked it. Not enough to return."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I decided to come because the pictures looks just like Roscoes chicken and waffles and we love us some Roscoes! I ordered the Betty Boob (1 juicy breast, 1 delicious waffle) and spicy corn fritters! The chicken really is juicy mmmmmm! Soooooo delicous! I definitely recommend this place if you don't mind a long wait!

They lost 1 star because the service was so unorganized and the wait was soooooo long.

1. We watched them seat two tables without them wiping it down from the previous people eating there. GROSS!
2. We asked the host if we can sit at the bar and she gave us a dumb look and said \"I don't know\". (Just so you know... If youre 21 you can sit at the bar if you want to skip the long wait, at least that's what we did.)
3. They have a bar with no alcohol because they don't have their liquor license yet.
4. The workers look like they don't like their job with no type of energy, looking lost and confused... Except our server PJ! He was great!
5. 45 minute wait for a table and another 45 minute ticket wait for the food. (PJ said the wait was worse yesterday!)

Me and my boyfriend will definitely be back for the great food! Hopefully the service is better by then.. But I guess I should've expected it knowing that it is their soft opening. Almost gave this place 2-3 stars but luckily the food was just that yummy to me!"}
{"text":"My family is from the South and I really enjoyed this place. Great service, huge portions, no waiting for a table, our waiter seemed like he genuinely cared about us. Menu can be daunting though, there's a lot to chose from and lots of options."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience I think that lolo's must be under new management because every time I've been here before it has been a great experience but today was the worst. 

I took us approximately an 1 hour and 15 minutes to get food and when it arrived the catfish was burnt. We also placed an order for corn bread but were given biscuits instead. 

Even our drinks were messed up we asked for water, the waitress only brought one cup of water out And no straw to use..lol.  This experience is was crasy..."}
{"text":"Average breakfast - good for settling in after our flight. Waffle was kind of mushy and the dirty rice wasn't great. Won't return, but it was alright for what it was."}
{"text":"The food, service and atmosphere is exceptional.  I love the food and affordability of the meal. This is going to be a family regular.  Our server Alyisia was excellent."}
{"text":"Great 1st visit!  Used the Nowait app and it was dead on!  Ordered the soul platter with 3 pieces of original fried chicken.  Two sides (of over 15 from which to choose) included the Mac n cheese and coleslaw.  Coleslaw was too creamy and soupy for me but theorist was great!  Cornbread finished out the platter with a huge blob of butter.  Delish!  Great soul food!"}
{"text":"Ronnie was great and actually everyone working from the host Josepf and some other servers who were happy enough to dance while working made it a great dining experience. The chicken and waffles were good but not over the top. I would recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I was excited because here I'm thinking, hell yeah  its bout to time we got a southern food restaurant, right?!
Wrong!! Me and my boyfriend went there sat down and waited 30 min to order. But we had to hunt down a waitress and ask her if she could get our order. Food and drinks were pitiful. For one the sweet tea was a mason jar of sugar, then they gave me the wrong order, it took about 20 to get my food right, there was a hair on my yams, and the rice was not cooked through. Not only that but our waitress Jazmin was hitting on my man. My boyfriend was like, what is this girl doing??!?! Point is I was starving and ended up not eating cause I was grossed out and dissapointed. The manager said, \"give it sometime it'll get better.\"
 I say, save your self the trouble don't go there."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is always a great place to eat, and our server Faith was awesome! However, today I can only give it 3 stars bc of all the fruit flies that were flying around the dinning room. I must have seen at least six!! Oh well, the food was still great and anytime you can have a Lifted Kilt with breakfast, is a good day, fruit flies or no fruit flies...."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken and waffles inexpensive and laid back experience. Friendly staff... No really long wait times. Two people ate for under twenty dollars. Will be back tonight lol"}
{"text":"Food is great, but the darn customer service is terrible. No one in the restaurant and it took over 30 minutes before we even received drinks. We came in last Sunday when Kevin Johnson (ex NBA player) was there the service was great and now they are back to their old ways...with the boss is gone then the customer service is back TERRIBLE. Suggestion: have more personnel even during the week days or people will go other places as there are many choices besides lolo. Your current staff will bring your business down."}
{"text":"We had Alex as our waiter,  he was awesome,  super friendly and helpful . He totally fool me when he said today was his 2nd day at the job.  Keep up the great work Alex"}
{"text":"Finally  tried this place after a few months of their grand opening.  We were sitted fairly quick but it took a long time for the waitress to came and ask us for our drinks. By the time she had a  chance  to check on us  we already knew what we wanted so we all ordered our drinks and food at the same time. It took another 20 minutes for us  to get  our drinks and different  waitress  came out with our drinks. I ordered the banana nut caramel  pancakes with no nuts. My husband  ordered  the lolos special which was the waffles and chicken. My niece had the shrimp and grits and my sister in law had the salmon  croquette  salad. The food took probably 40 minutes to come out and again a diffrent waitress brought it out. The place was not  busy  at the time so were surprised  that our drinks and food took a long time. The food was just ok. My pancakes had banana slices but no caramel.  The grits had a weird  after taste but the shrimp  was good. The salmon salad was just ok and the chicken and waffles  was also just ok. No one check to see if we needed a refill. The tables close to us was also looking  for any waitresses for refills. When we finally  saw a waitress  we ask if we could  get our  bill and her response  was \" sorry I'm  not your waitress\" so we flagged our waitress. I wont be coming  back to this establishment.  The long wait and lack of customer service is not worth it for me. We really  wanted to like this place especially  it's  just 2 minutes away from home but I'd rather just get some Popeyes  or KFC down the street."}
{"text":"I placed a to go order for 2 wings and a waffle and a side of collard greens. I should have ran away after the hostess offered me a menu that had melted cheese in it. The hostess told me that it would take 15-20 minutes. I stood up for most of the time because the seating area is way too small and I had a stroller. When the food arrived the hostess gave me my receipt and I gave her cash and waited for change. Instead of giving me change she proceeded to seat several parties as well as clean tables. After she sat the 4th party I informed her that I was still waiting for change. She said \"oh, that's right one moment.\" Yet sat multiple other parties. People in line were even annoyed and told her \"this lady is still waiting for change\" in which she proceeded to say \"I know\" I asked for her supervisor and instead of promptly getting her supervisor, she had a huddle with the waiting staff to tell them what tables she had opened. At this point I'm super annoyed! The young supervisor came out and offered me a free bread pudding, no thank you. I wanted to express the lack of customer service and the fact that I had a kid with me, waited 15 minutes for change and that my food was probably cold! The supervisor gave me change and took the collard greens off of my check. I wish I had left the entire order there because the waffle was soggy and tasted like flour, the chicken was mushy/bland and the collard greens were decent after doctoring them up with hot sauce, salt and pepper. I definitely won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"First off, I wish I could give this place zero stars.

The food was just okay, and nothing like what I was hoping for. Not only that, the food took 45 minutes to come out.

After placing my order, the waiter returned 15 minutes later to tell me she was out of chicken breast. I don't know why it took her 15 minutes to realize that. 

After A total of 45 minutes I finally got my
Original order.. ..    . .  . 

Thumbs down"}
{"text":"Let's keep it short and simple.

Service 2 of 5

A little on the slower side, not very attentive. Had to spend a few minutes trying to get the servers attention a few times. Food comes out slow but gives you more time to grasp hold of the decor.

Drinks 1 of 5

Ordered a Bloody Bacon Mary, extremely over seasoned but lacked one thing... Oh yeah alcohol.

Food 2 of 5 
Chicken and Waffles was just ok. Waffles were extremely soggy and the chicken was a little over cooked for my taste with an overpowering amount of sodium. I had to ditch most of the breading and go straight for the chicken. Would have been nice to have a choice of how your eggs are cooked, instead the scramble it then throw some raw onions in it with some cheese. Definitely a pass on those. The grits were so so, drowned in a lot of butter and love. 

Catfish appetizer wasn't that exciting either..

Overall you need a hole in the wall place for good soul food. This feels like a Roscoe and Applebee's had a bastard step child that tries to be a little to fancy. Really nothing drawing me back to this place."}
{"text":"Great service from start to finish we got seated right away and just a couple minutes later our waitress was there to take our orders. This was my first time here and I really loved the fried gizzards we ordered it was sooo tender and very flavorful seasoning a bit too much but still really good. I didn't really like the gravy on the chicken for the \"Baby Rays\" dish but that was my fault I should of just ordered \"Lo Lo's\" dish but the waffles made up for it big time loved the seasoning they put in it. My waitress went above a beyond to change out my waffles after she split syrup all over it making her way to the table and the new waffles came fast. Also what I really loved was the fact she gave me a to-go cup for my soda with my food container without me asking for one first. It's like she knew what I wanted in my head. Sad thing is I forgot I didn't get her name and I didn't keep the receipt."}
{"text":"I know the food is good as I have visited other locations.  Didn't eat here.  Saturday afternoon at 2 pm half the tables were empty and the wait to be seated was 2-1/2 hours because the kitchen was backed up.  Oh my.  The entity has been around long enough that they should understand how to staff the joint."}
{"text":"So this was sour first time eating here an j grave to say it was great. But let me say come hungry because the portions are huge. Our server Jazz was amazing. She helped out with the menu an made some great choices. My husband had the smothered gravy an onions on his with fried an Mac & cheese an a cornbread muffin. He said it was very good just that the gravy was a little salty. Jazz our server said that next time we come to let them know an they can out the gray on the side. I had the the 3 piece beats an 2 waffles. It was great an ended up taking some home. All I. All the food an service was great. Even the manager came over to ask us how everything was...I can't wait to go back an try the chicken strips next time. Hope we have the same experience"}
{"text":"Food: 2 stars
Service: 1 star

Your fried chicken made at home is probably better. Ghetto menu item names. I will never return to this location nor Phoenix. They suck!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly this place is pretty good! Not knowing what to expect from a soul food chicken joint in Las Vegas. Food was good nice and fresh good portions great service very friendly kind of a comfortable atmosphere I've had both breakfast and dinner would deathly recommend"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with Lo-Lo Waffles in Gilbert. The server Jai was not at all attentive to the table, never filled drinks and never even thanked us for our patronage.   The first order of French Toast came out burnt and the replacement order came out hardly cooked. The server was extremely poor and no apologies or manager in sight which tells me this is a normal process for this place. I will not come here again nor will I recommend it. It's too bad. Girls at the front more interested in talking with themselves then who was leaving the Resturaunt. Did I mention not a Manager in sight? Usually anytime a meal is sent back the proper thing for management in staff is to check if there is anything else they can do. By the way the table next to us has the same sentiments and a completely different server...go figure. Stay away! Not worth the overpriced food!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there's only three stars. The food is amazing. I had to try the chicken and waffles. The guys had burgers and the stupid fries. It was all really good. Only iffy thing I could mention is they didn't ask how they wanted the burgers cooked. 
Other than that, awesome. Try those fries. The side order was a whole basket. I can't image what the full size looks like. 
Worth a try for sure. Reasonable prices and good service as well."}
{"text":"There is always a long wait - on the weekend it can be three hours. We waited for an hour on a Wednesday night because I had never had chicken and waffles before. It was SO good! I loved it and so did the whole family. The chicken was so good and the waffles were tasty! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Bad service ...order my food with a side of just over easy eggs and it took them 30 minutes for my eggs I was almost done with my food ....waitress roll their eyes when they turn back from you and can't manage to handle their job ...by the way this place is not even busy the day I am here good food but the service sucks"}
{"text":"45 min for cake Togo there's 100 people working n 80% ain't doing anything. Plus the Scottsdale location its way better"}
{"text":"So delicious. SO DELICIOUS. Their chicken is so perfectly crispy, and everything is so well flavored. Not the place for a healthy meal but the best place for a filling and yummy one. Their portions could be split by three people. Service is really good too, friendly and quick servers who work as a team which is so important with restaurants. Their drinks come in mason jars too! And the decor is on point. I've never encountered a super long wait but even if I had id say it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The Fried Chicken is Good average Waffles, I did like the Chorizo and eggs although a little dry but the food was pretty good, I have heard good and bad things about Lolos.... and from what I can tell they are probably all correct. I heard bad things about the service especially and we came in at a slow time so the service wasnt bad, but they still could have come by to check on us a little more since it was slow and they did not. I guess nothing wrong with trying this place as I have passed by many times. It is decent and will come back again, but I will be in absolutely no hurry to do so. Sweet tea is pretty good"}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe that Lolo's was not busy around 5 pm so lets change that. The staff was extremely efficient and friendly. Service as a whole was great.

I had Stupid Fries (with gravy) which is outside  my comfort zone. They were awesome. Others in my party had chicken and Waffles. The chicken was flavorful and juicy. The waffle seemed like Waffle House quality. Drinks were great, I had the bacon Bloody Mary, a bit sweet but delicious.

Overall we will go back as the menu is full of great ideas. Cant wait to try something else."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was perfect! Super juicy! Kool Laid was on point especially the grape!  Server always checked up on us. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food was good actually better than good I can say it was amazing. The establishment was very clean. They have been open only a few weeks. Sat at the bar with out the intention of ordering adult beverages but they announced before we ordered that they had not received there liquor license yet. The food took a bit of time to come out and had to send back because it was missing items that the menus said came on my sandwich. Once it was fixed the food took two bites and it turned into something awesome. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the fact we sat by the POS and the waitresses kept talking bad about other co workers loud enough for us to hear during our entire stay. More than 5 times would they meet up and do this. Not having any regards for us customers whom were right next to them. With out the gossip talk it's a great place and would come back just now I know where not to sit."}
{"text":"We will frequently go to Lo-Lo's when in town. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Chicken & waffles for me DELISH! Hubby had fried chicken greens & mac n cheese. Chicken is so tasty. Have already recommended it to girlfriend who has gone, she felt the same way. When her family comes from Vegas to visit she will have them stop by Lo-Lo's to bring her food to Cali. I've read some interesting reviews. We went during a week day afternoon. No waiting & customer service was good. I ask my husband would he give Lo-Lo's a 4?  He said no a 5 so that speaks volumes coming from a harsh critic like him."}
{"text":"I love good food and I'm afraid that  Lolo's missed it. We were not impressed with anything... the chicken and fish were fried in old vegetable oil, the mac and cheese was over cooked and most disappointing --- the red beans and rice were a combination of ranch style beans and rice. Really!! We live in Texas where we visited the new location in Southlake. Yep, messed up there too, but the Phoenix location rocks. I hope the other stores catch up soon. Unfortunately, I won't be back to see anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was this close to not writing a review of our dinner here last night, but my wife and I have been talking about it all day. We waited about a month for them to iron out all the wrinkles but it wasn't enough. We've eaten at the original location and the Scottsdale location and while not as good as they should be, worth the visit. Downtown Gilbert is opening a new restaurant every month now it seems and just the law of averages says someone won't make it. Unless Lolos snaps out of it they might end up being the first casualty. Tho you'd never know it by the ample crowd on a Wednesday early evening. Service, though not that great, was about 35 minutes from seating to eating. Doable. But Lolos has lost it's soul. I stopped going to places like Popeyes years ago in an effort to support local restaurants but they sure made a good bird. Not so with Lolos anymore unless someone grabs the rudder of this meandering ship. Bring the soul back to the soul food Larry, you remember,  don't you? Not the cool to lukewarm dried - out almost tasteless clucker we forced down the other night. And the waffle... dry and also tasteless, served with some gloppy, syrup looking liquid that rounded out our last meal at Lolos. A shame really. Larry if you can hear me and the many who have criticized what's going on at your Gilbert Rd. location, do some serious soul searching and put the soul back in the soul food."}
{"text":"The service is completely horrible. I nearly had to wait almost an hour for my food. I walked in with my folks and we had to grab a waitress to get us drinks and take our orders after waiting for 40 minutes. I probably won't be coming back anyway because their food is kind of nasty and always overcooked. Their menu is small and not much has been graded. This isn't the place to spend money. I'd rather have Kfc if I want some chicken."}
{"text":"Been here previously service has been fine , but this last time has been my worst and I no longer will give my money to this establishment. Sunday night party of 9 came in at 4:15 pm and left at 5:49 being that our service was horrible and we waiting more then an hour for cold food . Couldn't even tell you the servers name and it was a slow day. Customers after us came , ate, and left before our sever even came to give us drinks . AT that the sever had alligator arms and continue to reach across our faces to give drinks . Just a horrible experience , manager was completely cool and did not give any problems when we were ready to leave . In future services I hope this business can improve in customer service I understand we are in the hood but good service comes from everywhere"}
{"text":"Great ambience with indoor/outdoor, fresh vibe. Very friendly staff. Food was ok - not terrible, not great. Sweet and hot wings were not sweet at all, just a mild red sauce. Fried green tomatoes came with a mayo mix instead of a traditional remoulade sauce which was disappointing. But the worst was the wait. 20 minutes to place our order after sitting down, my main entree came out but the appetizer didn't show up for 15 min and my mother and grandmothers entrees didn't come out for 40 minutes! Three of us were done eating and the other two still didn't have their food. Our waitress said - they ran out of grits and had to make a new batch, which fine I get, but what about the missing fried chicken, biscuits and gravy, or gizzard appetizer? No apologies, no manager stopped by, nothing. So crappy with a crappy wait, poor service, mediocre food...no we will not be back."}
{"text":"Chicken was good, waffles were ok. I ordered 2 different beers and they didn't have either so that was a bummer. So instead I got a water but didn't receive it until halfway through my meal. Our server was nice, she just forgot a couple things. The place was clean, menu had lots of options, and food came out quickly."}
{"text":"First time experience and it was fabulous! We had a brief wait for a table however, our waitress was very attentive to our needs. I wasn't sure on what I was ordering and the waitress walked me through the menu selection to ensure I ordered properly.  Our glasses never reached half full and our food was tasty! We will be visit again!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, I'm not a fan of their chicken & waffles due to the waffle but the chicken was good. My wife had the shrimp and grits which was pretty good. The waitress was very friendly and was always on point. The atmosphere inside was very welcoming and the music was amazing if you like R&B, I need their playlist . Overall I will go again, but I won't get the Chicken & Waffle meal."}
{"text":"We have gone to the Scottsdale location and never had problem waiting too long so we decided to check out this new location. Worst idea ever! We waited over and hour and half just to be seated. Once we were seated, we waited maybe 10-15 minutes for our server to come to our table. We ordered our food and we waited close to an hour and a half just for our food to get there. All this waiting for 15 minutes of stuffing that food down. Lol I think we're better off going to the Scottsdale location so I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Terrible service.... waited 30 mins just to get water then over an hour before just walking out because the food still had not came out. On top of all of that the waiter decided she would serve 2 tables that came after us instead of the people who have been waiting the longest with clearly closed menus stating we were ready to order.... and just to put the cherry on top she didn't find it in any way disturbing that she reeked of weed every time she walked by. Wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"SO AMAZING! I am from the area but moved to Chicago and my parents took me here over thanksgiving and I told them we HAVE to go back while I'm home for Christmas. The chicken was so juicy and well seasoned. The waffles were perfect. My sister got wings with a tangy sauce and they were bomb. The sweet tea is SUPER sweet, that is the only thing I wouldn't recommend. We went for dinner by I hear their brunch is amazing too."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken and the fried green beans were good too! Service was great! We're too stuffed for dessert but love the extra sweet sweet tea"}
{"text":"Arrived about 10 minutes after opening pulled on door handle and it was locked... Interesting... looked inside and you can clearly see that there are people inside. Finally someone came out and we were able to get inside. Waited for about 5 minutes to be acknowledged(was told they were understaffed.. seems to be the going theme) then another 5 minutes just to be seated. Once seated.. we did just that SIT!!!! 20 minutes since arriving someone came and took and drink order as well as food order.  

Once our order came... everything in my end was ok. I got the \"KK\": 3 pieces of chicken with waffles grits and eggs. I also ordered a side of home fries and catfish. 
My waffle was ok, nothing special once was a really crispy around the edges but ok. The chicken was alright and the fish lacked flavor. Overall nothing special food wise with horrible waiting time... our waitress was nice and trying to juggle a lot of not all the tables until helped arrived."}
{"text":"Visited the Scottsdale location for my BDAY a couple years back & really fealt it was a special treat.Took my Dad & his wife to this location while they were in town for vacation. The service was excellent & the food is just as wonderful. I'm happy they've arrived in Gilbert & like all downtown Gilbert restaurants they had a wait. Will definitely use the app to get on the waiting list before arriving. Welcome to Gilbert LoLo's! Looking forward to enjoying your new location more often...I've got to get off the chicken & waffles & enjoy all the other yummy things on your menu!"}
{"text":"I had such high expectations for this restaurant, I don't really complain because I know some days are just better then others but we just had horrible service here. I was with a party of 4 and we were immediately greeted and seated, our waitress came by after 5 minutes and asked for our drinks, we already knew what we wanted so we asked if we can place our orders while as we ordered drinks. She took our order and everything was fine. Until we had to wait for 45 minutes for our food. We didn't order that much especially since two of our party were just sharing a plate. I was able to notice people come in after us and received their food before we even got a refill on drinks. We barely saw our waitress she came by at most 4 times during our 2 hours here. Now I know that if it's busy it'll be a longer wait time for our food but it was almost completely empty in there. By the time we got our food it was honestly dry as can be, our waitress even mentioned that our food was being cooked fresh. They completely forgot items we ordered. I was hoping that lolos would be the vegas roscoes but as the concept is there the delivery was at best mediocre."}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffles??? Yes Please!!! The food is absolutely delicious. Their chicken is fantastic and the waffles are amazing. They even kool-aid on tap. So cool. However, the service is by far the WORST service I have ever experienced. Our server explained to us, while he was taking our order, that it's better if we pay him tip in cash. Then we received our food before we got our drinks. When I asked him about our drinks he stood there and had to ask us what we wanted again. I had originally ordered a beer but never got that. When he brought our drinks he didn't give us any straws. He never came back to check on us. The table next to us had to flag him down for the check after sitting there waiting for more than 15 minutes. I paid with a $100 bill and when he brought me my change he shorted me 75 cents. Service like that makes us not want to go back. I have heard from several people that they have had the same horrible service. Step it up Lo Lo's. You won't last long in this town if you don't."}
{"text":"Terrible! Coffee was bad, chicken was even worse. Zero flavor and dry as hell. WAY overpriced. Left pissed and still hungry bc I could only work my way through a small piece of chicken and quarter of a waffle before I gave up."}
{"text":"So good. Waffle was the perfect thin kind but still fluffy. The chicken breast wasn't dry and the breading was freaking amazing. And the syrup, ugh that Syrup. It would make dog poop taste like a piece of heaven."}
{"text":"really slow service 20 minutes to get seated and 45 minutes to get served. Food was not good at all. Will not return. Waiting staff leaves much to be desired. The only good thing I have to say is they do have a decent sweet tea."}
{"text":"\"This Ain't Yo Mama's Chicken\" ahaha I love that slogan. This was the first place we stopped at for our Arizona Adventure. The location is great because it is next to other places where you can eat and it is a nice place to have a late lunch & dinner. We came here on a Friday night. The places was full (inside & out), but we waited less than 10 minutes to be seated. The ambiance was relaxed and the had old school hip-hop music playing in the background, noice. The restaurant had pictures of the owner and his family, it was adorable. Our server was NATE! He was great  The hostess was very accommodating as well, and friendly. He was funny and made good recommendations for what we should order. I did a bunch of research before coming here (i.e, reviewed various versions of the menu, looked at other Yelper reviews and pictures, and looked at other Lolo's locations). I ordered \"Uncle Brotha's Shrimp & Grits\", a side of Mac & Cheese and Lolo's Punch. Everything I ordered tasted great except for the mac & cheese, it kind of tasted like velveeta, which is not a bad thing, but I expected a higher quality from a place like this. The shrimp & grits was  amazing, thank you Nate for helping me choose, I am glad that I made that choice. Everyone at my table kept on trying to eat my food, so yea order the shrimp & grits if you can. The Lolo's punch was tasty, but I may have to try the melon mojito or margarita next time I come back to Arizona. Overall, this place is great from the service to the food. You have to stop by"}
{"text":"There chicken is super good and juicy love the food the only problem I had with them was the wait to be seated and the long wait onto get our food after we order we waited like 40 mins to get a simple order for two chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"This was awesome great food , big portions , very clean, service was great must go place. Best chicken and waffles this side of roscoes in California ."}
{"text":"SO YUMMY and fantastic service! Ordered Shrimp and Grits, cooked perfectly and comparable to the authentic ones I get in New Orleans"}
{"text":"Lolo's chicken and waffles is one of my favorites from Phoenix. I waited for the hype to die down and went after church with my group. Unfortunately it took forever for us to get seated. It wasn't that busy, but our group of 5 may have been hard to accommodate.

What I loved about LoLo's in PHX was the hospitality, charm, and service. This location definitely lacked all of that. We were served our food without silverware and our server just didn't do it for me.

I have to say the food was good. I get their fried chicken smothered in sauce. I'm not a chicken and waffles type of person, but their fried chicken is delicious and I definitely recommend it. Prices are a little higher, but the food quality and quantity definitely make up for it.

Definitely try their garbage fries. Maybe they're called trash fries. Either way they are delicious. 

I was dying to go back to LoLo's in PHX for the longest time, but since coming to this Vegas location I don't have any urge to go back anytime soon. The food was good but the way our group was handled put a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Arrived today at 11:15 and was promptly seated. Had our drinks in less than 5 minutes. We ordered and had our food in about 15 mins. Excellent food. Big portions. Excellent service by Mike.  People need to quit complaining about the wait times; it's popular. To the lumbersexual who was complaining about the bar not having IPAs, you are more than welcome to go down the road to some \"craft\" beer joint and slug down some bitter swill.  Will be returning in the future and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Every time we have come here in the past we have had an awesome experience and loved the food and drinks. Today was a completely different experience. It took 20 min for a hostess to finally come to our table and ask for our drink orders... and then another 25 minutes to even be spoken to by a waitress. And there were plenty of waitstaff available... they just stayed focus on only specific tables for some reason. There were several other groups sitting with no food for a long time too and becoming visibly frustrated with the waitstaff.
When we finally got our food it was not good at all. The waffles had a completely different texture, the chicken was dry and lacking flavor. 
We were very sad to have such an unpleasant experience at one of our favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"This is the best spot I've ever had chicken and waffles, and with the STUPID FRIES you just can loose!"}
{"text":"We have never had a bad waitress or waiter, we have never had a bad meal, and the one time we had a mix up, they stood by their desire to treat the customer with respect.   We have come a dozen times, and plan to come back for many many many more.  Today was breakfast.   Shared the banana pancakes.  Price- reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"We love chicken and waffles and being from CA I love Roskoes. Unfortunately this was not a similar experience.

Paid extra for a chicken breast, received a thigh. Girlfriends meal was missing food and her eggs were burnt.

I will say the waffles were good, but they are soggy, not crispy.

We also didn't receive any syrup... Which was confusing to me.

Unseasoned grits were also a first and ended up in the garbage.

Definitely not comparable to Roskoes in LA.

I also watched one of the cooks set down a fresh waffle on top of one of the waffle irons and leave it there before plating it....and the work station looked very dirty."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place... but their wait time from getting our drinks to getting our food was nuts. We sat there for 15 mins. before someone even asked if anyone got our drink order. When we got the food, it was great but the food was cold and not worth that 1 hour wait for food. never again"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and wow!! Great food selection and the service was great!! My husband had the cat fish and he said it tasted like he was in Louisiana!! A must go to place:)"}
{"text":"Stood by the hostess stand for 15 min and was never greeted. A line of hungry patrons started to build up behind us. Finally acknowledged by a very stressed woman. No friendliness to her. Just looked at us and said it's an hour wait. Looked around restaurant- lots of empty tables and dirty tables. Thought ok maybe they don't have staff. Asked if we could eat at bar and was told we were still going to wait an hour because kitchen it backed up. Just really rude and disorganized. I've been to the one in Phoenix and it has a different feel that I loved.  This feels very corporate."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday for lunch, there were plenty of people waiting for a table, but we got lucky and were able to be seated right away with party of 5. We started with the fried pickles after debating whether to do the sliders or not. Our server steered us away from the sliders, which I appreciated- the pickles were the best part of our meal. 

Wife and I split the number 3- three pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. It was definitely enough food for us to share. We got 2 breasts and a wing. Both of the breasts were pretty dry, and the wing we ended up taking home for later. Waffles were decent, the syrup tasted like fake sugar- not a fan. The kids all split 2 waffles and a quesadilla (whatever keeps them happy). 

Service was a little slow, they were busy so that's not unexpected, but 20 minutes to get an appetizer is not ok. Lunch was $40 with a split entree, a little on the high side for dry chicken.

We probably won't be back as there are plenty of other options within a block that are consistently great."}
{"text":"Traveled from LA to Las Vegas to see what all the rave was about! We were not disappointed! Amazing food! Great customer service! Cool Ambiance! Our server was Nariah but everyone on your staff was superb! I know somebody's grandma is in the kitchen in her houseshoes & hair net on!! Whatever you guys are doing keep it up! You got it on lock!!"}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good, and the servers are nice, but goodness it takes forever to receive your food and they forget half of my order every time. I would just do take out with them going forward, because like I said the food is good and so is the service but I don't care to wait 30-40 minutes for chicken n waffles."}
{"text":"I love Lo Los! We came here early Saturday morning and were immediately seated.  Our server, Josh, promptly met us with a smile and drink menu. Josh was extremely patient when I asked my many questions relating to lactose in the food and beverages. 

I ordered the Kiss My Grits Special Breakfast. The biscuit was marvelous, moist, soft, and fresh. My husband ordered Yo Mamas Biscuits and Gravy. The gravy was delicious: creamy and savory. 

Our server asked the chef to leave all butter off my meal without me having to ask him.  It's this type of service and amazing food that keeps us coming back to Lo Los."}
{"text":"Awful experience. Food was bland and cold, even the mac and cheese! Service was slow and terrible. Who mops the front entrance of the restaurant at dinnertime?? We will not be going back - very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am not experienced with southern food, so I'm not sure how it's all supposed to taste.  I figure when someone opens a restaurant, they must have had cooking fans for sure!  However, my experience here a couple of times was just mediocre.

The first time I came in (which was not too long after they first opened up), I was excited to try chicken and waffles.  I had never had it before and was anxious to see what the fuss was about.  I ordered not only the chicken and waffles, but got gravy on mine - it seemed like the deluxe way to go.  The problem is, I didn't care for it at all. 

The next time, I tried the chicken and waffles without the gravy, wondering if I ruined it the first time and just wasn't a gravy fan.  Again, I didn't really care for the meal.  I didn't like the chicken and I didn't like the waffles either..I like my waffles with a slight crisp to them and these were more like pancakes with waffle shapes.

I also have mixed reviews on the staff as well, but I must say the first time, the staff wasn't all that friendly and the second time, the staff was super friendly.  I will attribute the first time to a bad day and we'll call it good there.

Overall, I guess things are \"OK\" here as the ratings suggest, but I guess I'm just one of those folks that doesn't like chicken and waffles.  Thus for me, it's a mediocre experience and nothing I would get excited about returning for."}
{"text":"Chicken seemed better at the Scottsdale location, the Kool-Aid was extremely too sweet couldn't even drink it had to keep adding water and adding water. Like I said the Scottsdale location is a winner and that is what made me go to this location I just don't love this one and don't know if I will be back."}
{"text":"love the chicken here!! I've never tried anything else but the Mac and cheese and it wasn't my favorite. But the chicken is delicious! service is not the great either but some days I've had great service other days I didn't. I guess they didn't do a great job with the hiring of servers but atleast the chicken is good !"}
{"text":"Good tasty food , friendly staff and fast service, had fried green  beans very good  , chicken very moist and tender , good stuff will be back"}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate our granddaughter graduation for breakfast. The waitress was awesome!! The food horrible!!! The scramble eggs were dry and hard, the bacon came to us barely cooked, the giant biscuits were hard on the outside and soft on the inside. I would not recommend this location for eating, we will continue to go to the other location on Central  in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles.  It is a strange combo, but a delicious one.  We had been to the one in Scottsdale and tried the new one in Gilbert.  While the food is just as great, the service was a bit slow.  Perhaps because it just opened.  Although the staff should already be accustomed to the busy times.  I would definitely come back, but I hope their service improves a little more."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The chicken was crispy and consistent throughout. The waffles tasted buttery and were also very soft. Great food. No qualms on the food. I met the manager Dave, super nice and professional gentleman. The only reason this place cant get 5 stars is because it was so dang hot and the restrooms were kind of gross..."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, first time having chicken and waffles and that's what I order the KKs 3 pieces of chicken, two waffles, grits, eggs and a side of gravy. Had the bacon Bloody Mary to top it off, terra was a great bar tender and waitress, I recommended this place especially for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have visited this place a few different times and have never been disappointed. Although Service can be hit or miss if they. Are busy and just overwhelmed but its still good to fantastic each time. They always take care of you. Food is great alway comes out hot. A must try is the Chicken & Waffles"}
{"text":"Management doesn't understand customer service. Came to lunch because family was in town. Our server was attentive, the orders were accurate and most of the food was good, with the exception of a salad that came out and as we were eating we realized that a large portion of the lettuce was wilted and inedible. We stopped eating and let our server know of the issue. 

Because of time, I just asked the server of she could just take the salad off our bill and we'd gladly play for the rest of the food (there were 6 of us). The server came back with the salad and kindly informed us the manager would not allow her to take the salad off our bill, so I asked to speak with the manager myself. 

Speaking to the manager yielded nothing and he went as far as saying that if he took the salad off the bill that I would be stealing since we had eaten some of the salad. I mentioned that I would call the general manager to figure it out later, but that I would not be paying for a salad I could not eat. 

Conveniently enough the GM was there. He too argued with me saying that even though \"the customer is always right,\" he didn't appreciate the fact I asked to have the item removed from the bill instead of \"negotiating\" something. He finally conceded and said he'd remove the salad from the bill but that I was no longer welcome to the restaurant. 

This is the first time in my 32 years of life that I've sent back food at a restaurant and the first time I've ever left a restaurant review, good or bad. I've never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant in all my life. 

If you go here, stear clear of anything that isn't deep fried and be sure to inspect all aspects of your food before taking a bite, otherwise you'll be accused of stealing should an issue arise."}
{"text":"Being tourists from LA, we decided to walk around Gilbert for food.. The last restaurant on the mini strip was Lolo's Chicken n Waffles.

From beginning to ending our food experience was amazing. Andrea was our server and she could've easily complained about my party changing our orders multiple times, but she happily made any changes we requested to make our time easy and enjoyable.

I ordered the chicken n waffles with fried okra and  collard greens -- the food was hearty and tasted amazing! The whole vibe about this place, the FOOD, and the service of Andrea contributed to one of the most enjoyable eatings of my time in Arizona. I wish LA could take notes."}
{"text":"The one thing the food was missing was the flavor...... I would have to say i will not go back."}
{"text":"This spot has good corn bread. But this spot has the sweetest Kool-aid. It's full of sugar and it's diabetes waiting to happen. The chicken is greasy as all get out too. I don't like this spot like that"}
{"text":"This is the worst resturant ever. Customer service was horrible, even the Manager Ray was horrible and they served us cold.food"}
{"text":"Been three times. Family LOVES this place! Teen kids want B-Day dinner here. Sat inside and on patio when weather permits. Both are great. Sometimes the street smell can be a little overwhelming since your right on Gilbert Rd. That said food and service is awesome. Old school Kool-Aid. Cinnamon flavored waffles. Grits, cornbread and chicken done right. Flavors incredible. Price is a little high but worth it for us on special occasions. Ambience is trendy kitschy southern fun. We'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"What's better than some good ole chicken & waffles? The bottomless mimosas for $10 on Sunday's!!! We've been coming to Lolo's for years and were pumped when this Gilbert location opened (prior we drove to Scottsdale). 

We've been here 4-5 since they've opened this location and it's always been 5-stars, so I'm shocked to see some recent reviews. The service is always great, it can seem slow at times but the place is always packed when we go. 

I've only had the chicken & waffles since I can't pass it up, so I cannot speak for their other menu items. I suggest #DD (2 chicken breasts with 1 waffle) or the Lolo-s (3 piece chicken with 2 waffles)."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dinner.  I was excited to try this place, that so many people raved about.  This location was a good size restaurant and simply decorated.  However, the floors felt greasy to me and my friends.  As for the server, I didn't catch his name, but he was courteous and attentive.  I opted to try one of their \"classic\" combos, Lolo's #3.  It came 3 pieces (breast, wing & drum) with 2 waffles.  Everything came out hot, the chicken was seasoned well, but the drum was a bit over cooked; borderline burnt.  As for the waffles, definitely seasoned and tasted good, but a bit too dense & not crispy, for my liking.  But still would recommend and I would go back to try their many other menu items that looked good."}
{"text":"This is an average chicken and waffles place and I think it all comes down to service. I ordered the KK'S and my wife ordered some oreo pancakes both orders were hot and fresh and tasted delicious! But the service wasn't on par, it was rather slow for a not that busy friday night at 8:30 and our waiter talked so quiet I could barely make out what he was saying. Bottom line is if you want good food and could care less about good service then have at it just bring a hearing aid if you get the same waiter I did."}
{"text":"Came here for New Year's Eve my step sister informed me about this place. It's located in a shopping center so there's more than enough parking space. The customer service is good they gave me a southern hospitality feel. They were playing 90's music that day so I was singing the whole time I was there lol. Now the food it's served in good size portions and has good flavor. There drinks are served in big mason jars. I'd definitely come back. Didn't give it five stars cause the booth needed the be wiped down there was syrup on the seat & table"}
{"text":"Our 3rd attempt at getting in this place was a success! It was so worth coming this morning . We walked in with no waiting and sat outside on the patio. It was beautiful outside this morning !! We were sitting under the misters sipping mimosas, people watching and waiting for an amazing breakfast to be served . I ordered the biscuits and gravy with potatoes and eggs . The biscuits were so fluffy and so tender you could mistake it for cake !!  The sausage gravy was made with love  and the potatoes were seasoned perfectly and fried to perfection . My bf ordered the waffle and grits . He said the waffle was crispy and Delish ! He wasn't fond of the grits ,but I think it's because he was comparing them to his Nannys cooking .. The people sitting next to me had French toast with berries & cream .. OH...MY...GOODNESS... That is what I am ordering next time we come ."}
{"text":"First time here, and I will definitely be back! They just opened so be expecting a bit of wait. Got seated after 15 minutes of waiting for a party of 2. 

Luis was our server and he had excellent customer service! A trained staff as well! Had 2 other servers who were just passing by concerned if we needed any refill on our drinks and how they food is. Management came by along as well just greeting by every table asking how every thing is.

Ordered the Shrimp Mac and Cheese and it is the best mac and cheese I've ever tasted... and I'm not over exaggerating. Every single bite had flavor. Also tried the Pineapple Upside Down Cake with turkey bacon, and that was delicious as well! Not too sweet, and extra crispy bacon to my liking!"}
{"text":"First time at Lo-Lo's and I must say the food was excellent. My wife and I split the #3 LoLo's and it was plenty of food, she also ordered a side of cheese-grits. The restaurant is very nice and clean with comfortable booths in the bar area. Giving a 4 star rating because the service was a bit slow with our waitress. Will try again next time in Vegas hopefully the service improves."}
{"text":"I am from Southern California,  I have had  Roscoe chicken and waffle , there is no comparison.  LO LO'S is absolutely great. The chicken was well done, tender and moist. Even the breast was moist. The sides were so so, but passable.
Our server Tinisha was gracious helpful and effecient. I would recommend this establishment.  
When I return I will make Lo Lo's a must.
Thank you Tenisha for all your kindness."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Kept it simple chicken and waffles. Good options. Wife and girls liked the Kool Aid. Service was slow and wait long. 3rd day open. Kitchen slow. Waitress was awesome, kept her cool while everyone else was running around including the manager. My waitress was in control. Kept checking on us. Co u ldnt help but compare to roscoe's. Good substitute for roscoes.
Will return. Good price, good value."}
{"text":"My first Chicken and Waffle experience, was the best. We met Spark who is the bartender there, who hooked us up with a fresh batch of fried chicken, waffles, with some warm maple syrup, then some refreshing Kool-Aid on tap.... He even brought us some biscuit to go with our meal. My family and I felt right at home. For dessert we had their rated number 1 Red Velvet cake."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place, really. I had been dreaming of southern style chicken and waffles and alcoholic kool-aid for months. 

Tonight we decided to stop by. We have dined at almost all of the restaurants in downtown Gilbert, liberty market, postinos, zinburger, snooze, barrio queen.. we expected something similar. 

Wrong. We arrived at 5:45, the hostess was busy putting tables together or something, waited a few minutes and we were sat in an almost empty restaurant. 

Now it is 6:05, the only interaction we have had with anyone is one server saying she would \"grab our server for us\" did not offer water or ask for our drink order. A few minutes later our server arrives, we are told we cannot get happy hour pricing because it was now almost 10 past 6 even though we had been sitting for a while now. Ok,no drinks, I'll live. 

We needed a couple extra minutes to decide on food, about 15 minutes later the bartender takes our order to give to our server. Food comes 10-15 later. They had forgotten the extra side of eggs I ordered and my boyfriend ordered the #1 and received 2 wings and a thigh, no breast. They did the same to the child next to us but shorty after brought her extra breast meat. 

Food was ok and filling. Nothing special or worth the money. Chicken was burnt/dry, syrup thin. No one stopped by to ask how it was or if our food was even correct. We have not seen our original server since before we even ordered. Bill comes, no eggs on ticket, I guess they just forgot to put them in all together.

Now my boyfriend and I are both servers at very busy restaurants. It takes a lot for me to get upset about the service I'm receiving, I'm very easy going and understanding with servers. Never in my life have I considered leaving less than 20% OR speaking to a manager, but this was uncalled for. This restaurant was a third full, there is no reason for our service to have been the way it was. 
To top it all off there are a few nice TVs all on TMZ, during Monday night football. 

Overall I will never return here, I won't let my family or friends come here. I am disappointed because I didn't want to believe these reviews. I feel like I was robbed and I don't know how this place has lasted in an area that has mostly 4.5 star restaurants. Very stressful experience. Same goes for the tables around us. Get it together. Great concept and food, but this place obviously needs different leadership to whip these servers in shape."}
{"text":"I love Lolos but this location is not good, sadly. I've been three times and each time the macaroni and cheese has been cold, dry and not very good. I can unfortunately say the same for the chicken too. It's so disappointing because this one is close to my house. Go to the Scottsdale location instead, worth the extra drive!"}
{"text":"This was our second time back after being there for opening week. The food is good but still some major issues with the kitchen end timing. We waited 45 minutes for two people to get breakfast. Seems like there's a lack of oversight managing the flow."}
{"text":"They are over priced and they are getting over on poor white that think this is real soul food. Very nice place to sit down and chill and drink but the food is just alright. It's a shame that this place started off as Ms. Whites and with her doing the cooking make every bite memorable... Now it's commercial like and it sucks! The best place to find soul food are in Those little whole in the walls on the west and south side!!"}
{"text":"I want to start off my saying we will NOT be back to this place and its not bc of the food. Its bc of the service, we me re received r drinks or r food. 
We walked in and it was pretty busy but got seated very fast bc it was just 2 of us.
So after we were seated not one person came over to us to take our drink order we wanted for more than 10 mins as people walked past us and I watched as others were being seated and waited on but not us, finally someone stoped and asked us if we had been waited in and we ofcouse said no. Right in front of us was our waitress running around waiting on everyone else but us, and the guy that asked us if we had been waited on asked the girl right in front of us if we had been waited on he asked her to get our order and she said yes she, she just walked away and never came back.   no drinks and still no food. 
We people sat there a total of 45 mins or so and nothing so we got up and left.
So this is why I will not ever be going back to a place that treats others like this, I do not care how good the food could have been if the service is not good then the food will be just as bad.
So No thank you I will not be eating at this place ever."}
{"text":"Its amazing tasty chicken and waffles there shrimp grits is fire to die for willbe back"}
{"text":"Great food. Very nice atmosphere. Our server Chris was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. This young man made our first visit here a wonderful experience. Will be returning soon for some more wonderful food"}
{"text":"There is a difference this time chicken was cooked on point,ask  I let mr. Nate to let mr. White know everything much better this time all waitresses was excellent service very helpful and my first waitress young small black girl very very nice, but very everybody did good"}
{"text":"High expectations...very disappointed. I didn't expect much with regards to the food - you get what you expect which are chicken & waffles, however, there's more to restaurants than food. The service was horrible! For a party of 8, we were quoted 30 minutes to be seated but it took 45 mins. It would be a completely different story if we weren't getting told every 5 mins \"it'll be ready in 5 mins...\" It took almost 20 mins to get a drink at the bar........that was empty!!! When we eventually were seated at the table, we didn't even need to take a look at the menu since we had so much time to review it and decide what we wanted while we waited for our table. It took almost an hour to get our food! While I was eating, I couldn't help but notice the 2 MOD's (Managers on Duty) standing together on the side hanging on the railings like children hang on the playground chatting it up like they don't have a restaurant to run and customers to satisfy. The food was delicious but not good enough for me to pay a second visit because the service was beyond terrible. If Yelp had an option for negative stars, I'd give them -5! Vegas is known for service regardless if the restaurant is on The Strip or around the corner from your house. My advice (and this is coming from a very seasoned F&B hostess/server/bartender/manager) is to step up your game if you want to survive!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since it is so close to my new house. I had two pieces of catfish, greens, mac & cheese, and cornbread...all for $15. Everything was yummy. The mac & cheese and greens were slightly on the cold side, but the great flavor of both made up for it. The BF and I plan on returning to try the fried chicken. Staff was real friendly"}
{"text":"Wow and WOW!  Has to be Vegas's best kept secret for soul food on the west side! Outstanding chicken and waffles (hubby's favorite) and the soul food combo (I love chicken and catfish, although they have about 8 choices of different proteins), which offers 2 of maybe 20 sides has given me a chance to try a bunch and all of them are YUM!  Tonight, hubby went with Lolo's, which is 3 pieces of fried chicken (OMG! the skin and batter is awesome and my sister says the way it is cooked that it should be served as an appetizer before getting the chicken and waffles!) and two perfect waffles.  Yeah, a lot of chain restaurants have started serving chicken and waffles, but blah!  These truly rival Roscoe's in Long Beach, which WERE the best anywhere...move over Roscoe!  I got a combo with 3 pieces of chicken (mixed and matched the way you want, so I got 3 thighs) a waffle, cornbread and eggs with onion and cheese...delish!  We are now coming at least once a week...can't drive by without wanting to stop.  You got to try it.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not good at all food cold no seasoning on chicken the service was fast and the servers was friendly but the food sucks."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the waiters here are so unfriendly, the whole time we were there we barely even got a smile from any of them. We waited 20 MINUTES to even be acknowledged and asked if anyone had even taken our drinks yet and finally got to order something to drink. We ordered and the waitresses kept coming around trying to give us orders from other people. It took another 20 minutes to get our correct order.
The only person that even made an effort to try to turn our experience around was the manager Nate. He was very apologetic for the wait and offered us a free dessert after our meal. The only other good thing was the food, it was tasty but we didn't even enjoy it because there were seriously 4 other tables around us all complaining about the wait also. The service was terrible and just all over the place."}
{"text":"Came in with a party of six, everyone was amazed at how fast we received our order and how nice the staff was. Portions were large and everyone left satisfied, definitely would recommend. I know they are new and some of the reviews are poor but we've been there a couple times now and have had no problems."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and have had very good experiences. However, this time left a lot to be desired, where the service was concerned. I notice that another reviewer experience the same issues were had so perhaps they are having a bad day. We waited 20-30 minutes for a waiter to take our drink orders and another 30 minutes to take our food orders, and still another 30 minutes to get our food. We ordered meals and most food was brought out a la carte and charged that way. To be fair, the waitress was really new and inexperienced. She didn't seem very familiar with the menu and a bit disorganized. I don't completely blame her. There was a lot of wait staff walking around but didn't seem to be aware of customers waiting. Didn't seem like a good team effort to help each other out.
After we had finished eating, it also took us another 20-30 min wait to get our check. We were seated on the patio so we expected a little out-of-site, out-of-mind but we were there almost three hours. I have to say that the manager did come out and talk to us. He was very apologetic and offered us a free dessert. 

Did I mention that the food was very good? It is what will bring me back. The chicken fried chicken was excellent, so was the catfish. The chicken of course was wonderful-cooked perfectly and I could eat a dozen prices of their cornbread.Having said all that. I will come back and give them another try and deserve a second chance. I am hopeful for a better experience next time. I even hope to have the same waitress. She was very sweet and I am sure she will get better with more experience."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at Lolo's Gilbert today. The wait was over 45 minutes. They sat us outside, the outside area is not equipped for Arizona heat. The seats and table top were burning hot. No shade, no umbrella nothing to block the sun. We had small children and they stated the seats were too hot, informed the staff and they said sorry you can't move even though there were 3 tables inside that was open and ready. The waiter never refilled our drinks throughout lunch. As we were leaving we witnessed management yelling at the staff members. Such an awkward and horrible experience! Customer service is horrible!!"}
{"text":"Got to the restaurant at 8pm on a Saturday night. 4 tables were occupied and the rest were open. We were the 5th table. Here is a time line of our visit...

8:18 the host took our drink order and food order. The girl who we would learn at the end was our server, pointed to us and told him to take our order. I don't think she likes us. She doesn't make eye contact. We did just come from watching a baseball game so maybe it's because we are dirty or smell? Can't tell.

8:27 we get our drinks. 

8:33 we are told by the host that they are out of the Malaysia burger. So we order a chicken tender basket. Still no sign or word from our server.

8:43 the manager, Nate, refilled my drink and my sons. He also told us that they are out of the Malaysia burger.  We were tempted to mess with him and act completely shocked but decided that we didn't want to confuse them all more since this was becoming a train wreck. We told him that we changed it to the tender basket. We informed him we haven't met our server yet. He goes back the kitchen and starts yelling a woman's name. 

8:45 the other server (who's name we learn is Kiki) brings out two boys get their tender baskets. Food looks amazing. For real.
As the boys are eating and Marvin Gaye's \"Sexual Healing\" comes on. While this type of music is what helped with the boys coming into the world, not the best song choices for a 3, 10, 11 year old. 

8:52 Kiki comes over and asks what my wife and youngest ordered. Wife contemplates whether she should risk telling them what she ordered, tell them to forget it, or start messing with them. At this point we want to get out of there. Since we will never come back, she decides to try it since we are there.  We tell her to forget the order for the youngest. He was oblivious and wouldn't have liked the mac and cheese. He's picky. 

9:00 Kiki brings my wife her food. Looks like they put a frozen breakfast meal on a plate. The waffle looks like a crepe and the eggs look like a tube of yellow sponge. She wasn't happy with it and it didn't look that good. Our server still hasn't been to the table. She has been to the 3 other tables in our area to get their drinks and food and bring bills but not us. I'm beginning to get a complex and think it's because I stink, I'm ugly, or I some how offended her in another life and she remembers. Regardless, she sucks. 

9:10 my wife is done, we are all done. Since our server is now deliberately doing everything possible to ignore us and isn't hiding the fact we have somehow offended her to the point that she is refusing any and all interaction, my wife goes and gets containers from the counter where the registers are since we apparently have the plague and can't get help. 

9:13 kiki walks by so I ask the name of our server.  She tells me it's Mimi. We inform Kiki that we haven't met Mimi at all. Kiki acts appalled but she has to know that Mimi sucks and doesn't want to admit it. Kiki tries to mitigate Mimi's total suckage by saying it's because she is new.  I'm not buying it. I thought Kiki was cool but now I think that Mimi has roped her into her little devious mindgame that Mimi is in the end stage of executing but I'm on to her. Kiki goes to tell Mimi the jig is up and we want our bill. 

9:15 Mimi makes her grand appearance. When my wife informs Mimi that everyone else did her job and we didn't see her at all. Mimi confidently replies that its \"because I didn't get a chance to come over.\"  She says it with gusto and without the slightest hint of apology or acknowledgement of her awfulness. She never apologizes and appears oblivious to the fact that she didn't do her job and openly admitted it like it was no big deal. She hands us our bill with a smile like her boo boo don't stink and asks if everything is right. That takes some gumption man. You are our server and the fact you don't know our order and have to ask us to verify its veracity is the pinnacle of trash. And the kicker of it all is that they still had that dang Malaysia burger on it as well as the mac and cheese we order for our youngest but canceled. They also had the tender basket we ordered as a replacement for the Malaysia burger. My wife pointed it out and she went to fix it. We learned that Mimi is actually named Mishiawna. I've been deceived again. This place lures you in and disappoints you like a blind date that has a good personality. So Mimi brings the \"corrected bill\" and while the mac and cheese was taken off, the stupid Malaysia burger was still on the bill. So we point it out again and she goes and fixes it, again. So we get the bill for a third time and its finally right. Mimi tries to hang around like we are old friends, i'm sure to see the giant tip she is expecting, and I look at her like she just kicked my dog and flicked a booger at me. She then scurries away to the hole she was hiding in all night. I promptly sign the receipt and we leave, never to return."}
{"text":"My cousin and I had lunch today. We had the most wonderful, professional server named Sparky. Sparky was friendly, patient, and very knowledgable of the menu. I had the 3 piece chicken in smothered gravy, Mac and cheese, and rice and gravy, needless to say; I won't be cooking dinner! Donna Jean had the 2piece chicken and waffles, and we share dessert, banana pudding! This is my fifth time at Lo lo and every time has been exceptional. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Lo-Lo's...Baller status!! When your'e okay standing an hour in line to eat food, you're in the right place!!  We are trying to get them to come to Mesa. Meet with the Mayor and others about a great location next to the Rail, across from the Mesa Arts Center, great parking and a lively downtown!"}
{"text":"My charge nurse recommended this place since I live about 10 minutes away from it and that her family just loves Chicken and Waffles. So I tried going on a Wednesday after my night shift and to my dismay found out they open at 9. I got there at 8:30 and wasn't planning on staying for another 30 minutes since I'm already sleepy. So I gave it another go on Friday.

The place was roomy. It has a bar on the middle which was pretty spacious. Multiple screen TVs where you can get your sports on if you happen to fancy eating waffles and drinking beer at the same time while watching the Olympics. I was seated on a booth (to my surprise) and the place wasn't as busy when I went (which was good). 

I forgot the servers name but he was really nice. He looked like he had a busy morning because even with only two customers he was huffing and puffing. The menu had plenty to offer. Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner or a combination of the two or three if you wish. I went ahead and ordered Lolo's Chicken and Waffles since well that's what I came for. I saw from reviews that they also liked the Banana Pudding so I ordered that one too.

On to the food. The Waffles were soft, a hint of Cinnamon is there but not overpowering. The butter they served with it was perfect and just made me smile seeing that gold turn to liquid (yeah I'm a fat ***). To my surprise it was the chef that served the food to me! I mean I'm sorry if I put everybody on an inconvenience by going there for lunch. Either that or he was just happy to serve the food he made. But he looked really nervous for some reason. I don't bite. Well not unless your food that is *wink*. So he told me he'd be back with syrup and yes he did. The syrup was warm and went perfectly with the waffles. It was good but I was never really into waffles or had not had too many growing up so there wasn't really anything for me to compare it too. But the taste was just right. There wasn't any after taste or anything that you would usually get if the batter came from a box. And no I'm not saying it came from a box. I'm just saying the ones that come from a box have aftertaste is all. I know very well they make theirs from scratch. Which is a good thing.

The chicken!!! Okay so I'm a big fan of fried chicken. And growing up having been a patron of another restaurant I have a lot to say about Lolo's fried chicken. First of all they are big! As in it looks like they gave me the whole chicken with the three piece I got. All that was missing was the head. The portion is good for someone who's about ready to eat a horse but I believe I ordered too much for my appetite this time around. The skin was crispy but needs a little salting on some parts of the chicken. The taste didn't overpower the waffles and actually went great with them. The meat was tender and became very addicting as I dug through and through. It didn't compare to previous ones that I've had but it paired nicely with the soft waffles they made. But like I said it was just way too much for my appetite this time around and actually had to take some to go (and my fat *** always finishes a plate). That's just how much their servings are.

The banana pudding then comes around and the presentation was really nice. It was served on a Mason Jar with whipped cream on top with tiny butter cookies. It wasn't too sweet and kind of reminds me of bread pudding and was wondering whether the banana is mixed in the pudding or was it just the banana slices that were giving the taste. In my opinion it needed more banana slices. I just had way too much food to start off with so I wasn't able to finish the dessert.

Overall I would say I need a second trip to this place or maybe even a third. But it probably would not be on the top of my list if I have a hankering for Chicken and Waffles. The place has a nice ambience to it and almost feels like a fancy diner where you get to sip wine with your dinner and waffles or drink beer with your breakfast and of course waffles. Waffles, waffles, waffles haha."}
{"text":"This food here is always amazing. Our waitress was a little strange, but the food was amazing. We asked for avocado, and it seemed like we got just a small piece for what we paid for it. Sucks. The mac and cheese, corn bread, and waffles are amazing. And the fried chicken is the best I've ever had. Surprisingly on a Friday night, there wasn't a wait. The sweet tea is amazingly sweet and delicious. Always stop here when we're in town."}
{"text":"Fried Green tomatoes tasty. Had the Lo Lo french toast. Great start to the day. Service was awesome with Jasmine. Hostess said this was the suppwr busy time...and to not come on a Sunday after 12. Seating was fast. I would return and try something different too."}
{"text":"Just okay, not really a fan and won't be back. Service was not attentive, I was expecting chicken and waffles like that famous place in Los Angeles, but did not get what I was anticipating, sad after being told good things about this chain. It was bland and disappointing.."}
{"text":"Aside from the ever long wait to be seated, the food was delicious and the music was great too! I'd love to go back, reminds me of home."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my daughter's birthday. First off, the host Christian was rude and had the attitude that he didn't to help my group of 9. We came in at 5 PM. Ordered and still had not been served at 610. In between that time 3 other groups were served that came in after us. And had finished their dinner.  Waitress Rayvin then proceeds to tell me that fish takes longer to cook. I asked for my check for my drinks and had to wait another 10 mins but never got that either. Ask the female host several times for my check but they pretty much just ignored me. Being a minority, I always try not to use race as an issue, but having said that I know how it feels to be discriminated against. This was one of those times. I guess I was the wrong color on this night. The three other groups that came in after my group were white and they all got their food before mine. Its upsetting and they ruined a special night for my child which upsets me the most. Do not insult my intelligence by stating fish takes longer to cook than chicken. If it takes you an hour to cook fish you should not be selling fish. Just venting. Posted by charity's husband."}
{"text":"I want to give Lo-Lo's 5 stars only because i could not give them 10 best dinning experience i have had in vegas. Shannon our waitress was really full of spunk very helpful, very kind. Great Establishment !!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't come here without a voracious appetite.  I ate at 10am and 22 hours later I write this review, still not hungry.  You get your money's worth.  I had the omelet which was enormous and liberally filled with breaded fried chicken, peppers, and cheese.  Dynamite.  Additionally we ordered the Lo-Lo (3 pieces of Fried Chicken and 2 waffles).  That is a meal you can split between two normal human beings.  Throw in a gigantic mason jar of coffee, tea, Kool-Aid...whatever...and you're going to enjoy yourself.  

Besides the very enjoyable food the atmosphere is vibrant and the service was fantastic.  Our server, EJ, was terrific.  Honestly, he was one of the best servers I've encountered anywhere including fine dining."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with the service and the chicken.  

First the pros's:
Biscuits and gravy were very flavorful and had such a yummy fluffy biscuit.  The kool-aid was fun and the waffle was a great recipe. 

The cons:
The waitress herself was great but when my son tried the cream on his Oreo pancake and didn't like it all (I even forced him to try 2 more bites to make sure), I asked if they could make him another pancake without the cream.  The waitress said \"that's why I put the cream on the side because kids don't like it\".  Then she told me this is a mom n pop restaurant and they don't remake things if you don't like it. I personally have worked at 4 REAL Mom n pop restaurants (2 were breakfast only) and they would have never argued the customer of a pancake that most likely costs about 30 cents.  
The chicken had a tasty breading by my drumstick meat was rubber.  Such a bummer."}
{"text":"Price for two pieces of bacon $4.00 
A dollop of canned whipped cream $1.00 
That's what you get if you dare order extras!!"}
{"text":"First timer here it's a Sunday busy day our server Dre was amazing super sweet and knew what she was doing with a friendly smile. We're from Los Angeles and she made me feel right home."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Saturday and Charrae was our server. It took quite some time for her to take our order but when she came over she was not very pleasant - seemed rushed and frustrated and when I asked a question it was as if it was a burden for her to answer it and her huffing and attitude. So I just left it at that. 

Next we noticed all the other tables around us that she was helping, she was incredibly talkative and asking questions - basically she was the complete opposite of what we got. 

Our food took over 25 mins to get (no biggie) but she didn't even come back to check on us all the while going to every other table around us to serve their food, check in on them, etc...we finally asked another waiter to kindly grab our tab or our waitress and she finally returned with our tab.

Overall, I expected to be there for max an hour but it took us almost two hours from sit down to paying. Basically our food was good but the service was terrible. Charrae seemed annoyed and didn't engage us at all, kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"The chicken was on par with a Swanson's Hungry Man Fried Chicken Dinner, the waffle was more pancakey than waffle. The music is ridiculously loud and I have a feeling when the shine wears off of this place there will be a new tenant in that space. You can't live by Chicken and Waffles and do both that poorly. This place is a bad copy of the original south Phoenix Lo Lo's so save your money and go to ANY of the other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"5 stars because it tasted exactly like I hoped it to. I ordered the (can't remember the title) chicken breast: not greasy, not dry, perfectly crunchy;, grits, eggs, biscuit, house fries. I can't fix my mouth to call it  delicious,  that's a stretch for something that I'm so used to eating and cooking myself, but I Will say it was perfect. Cooked to perfection. I've had the same chick combo at M&M's and this is wayyyyyy better. Of course I'll be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service I went to the Gilbert location the Scottsdale location is my favorite. My friend gets there 20 min before me to order. I get there he's at the bar no drinks, no service, and the bar is dirty with food and spilt drinks (this is at 12:20 on a Wednesday not to crazy) We wait another 5 min I get up and ask for a waitress we order. 12:45 rolls around,no food no waitress, and  no one cleans up where we were sitting. We cancel our order. Shame on you Lolo's I've read all the reviews and you don't you should want to be better. 
Ever since you franchised your business you no longer care. You changed the menu instead of keeping it what you were about and that was soul food. Lo-Lo's was about the experience the food the music the culture. What happened? Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"The wait for this restaurant to open has been insane! Thankfully for IG, I am up to date on everything. This is where the old Tony Roma's used to be, in case you missed the bright yellow Lo-Lo's sign!

Upon entering you are greeted by the amazing group of hosts, they ask if you've been to Lo-Lo's before and are super welcoming. The decor here is amazing, brick and cool gray flooring. The middle you have a bar with huge tvs, and there is outside seating available. 

Tonight is the soft opening,  so the menu isn't as huge, but they will start serving full menu 1/29 Friday. Only the best items were chosen :) we opted for the #7 toy toy, 2 wings and a waffle. I got the chicken dinner,  three pieces with 2 sides and and corn bread... figured I'd eat off Santiago's waffle! Lol. 

The chicken: The chicken is amazing! Its soooooo succulent and fresh! The breading is insane, perfect, not overly greasy and perfect! Did I mention, perfect? The chicken portions are large! I ordered the dinner and was able to take half of it home. The sides I got were the mac and cheese, and red beans and rice. Mac and cheese was yummy, and to begin with I'm not a red beans and rice fan, but they were good. The corn bread is seriously the best I've tasted! It has actual corn in it and the crust is insane! DELICIOUS!

THE WAFFLES! THE BIG WINNER HERE! They are OUTSTANDING! Perfectly cooked and seasoned! Like pillows of heaven in your mouth!

The servers here are definitely ready to work and make sure you're fully taken care of, our server was super great and actually spoke to us and cracked a joke! Rory and Semaj are seriously great!!

GET SOME!!

YAY!"}
{"text":"First time I was here heard about it from a friend..... Honestly I'll never come back to this place because of the service our waiter was trying to work everyone else's table and forgot about her own, I waited a total of 45 mins for my food after being seated..... if you are a large party you will definitely  be accommodated  because of the number in your group. The food is honestly decent, but it's something you can live without."}
{"text":"My wife & I walked in & went str8 to the bar, it's always faster I believe. Service & food were wonderful. The Kool aid was on point. Corn fritters were amazing as well. I got chicken & waffles & so did my wife. Food was fresh & hot. We will return soon."}
{"text":"Lolo's Chicken and Waffles soooooooooo good!!!!! Been here twice and would totally go back. 
However, they need to improve their service. One time the table next to me waited for more than 45 min to get their food, and the second time I went we waited 1 hour to get our food when the restaurant was not so busy. They need to be more organized, friendly or hire more staff."}
{"text":"Yeah.... don't go here. The chicken is dry. The waffles are mushy. The service is even worse than the food. 

But at least the syrup and koolaid was pretty good ?"}
{"text":"Food was excellent kool aid is the bomb. Fifty is the best waiter I have had in a very long time . He had a great way of getting you to laugh and loosen up...............will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Imagine juicy flavor packed fried chicken with a fluffy waffle with a slight crunch to it. All of it doused with gravy and syrup. So bomb!

Service is always friendly and 90 slow jams in the background is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Not a bad new selection for our dinner! I had simple waffles, eggs & seasoned potatoes..... it was yummy, waffles had a hint of cinnamon & potatoes had just the right amount of bell pepper & onion! 
Husband had the famous soul food platter.... chicken leg, wing & thigh (was a bit dry on the chicken but still good), mashed potatoes with side of corn! Not bad, he said he will try the white meat next time."}
{"text":"I'm from Kentucky and I'm not going to lie, I think my grandmother was in the kitchen frying up this chicken because it was AMAZING. It was crispy without the chicken being dry. My waffle was fluffy and I couldn't even finish the whole thing. The Kool-Aid might put you in a diabetic coma but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"Service was both slow and poor.   The place was busy so we had to take a table instead of a booth.   We saw a booth getting cleaned up before we gave our order and asked to move to it.   The waitress refused.   We still wanted to try the place so went ahead and ordered anyway.   The waitress was very slow to actually let us order though and the whole time we were there  she only offered to fill my coffee once.   After ordering the wait for food was extremely long, probably 30 minutes.  When food finally arrived the waffles were cold and limpnthe chicken was barely room temperature.   My chicken was okay but jeff's was really dry (as if it had been under a heat lamp).   We couldn't even get the server woman's attention to complain.   Overall I would say that getting chicken from KFC or Popeyes and pairing it with eggs toaster waffles would give higher quality food.   

I will not go to this restaurant again and will caution my friends to avoid it as well."}
{"text":"This place is a good place to get chicken and waffles, I seriously love thier food but the only thing I'm not loving are the prices on just a side of fries which are $4.00 and a drink is $3.50 which makes sense because you're drinking out of a Mason jar but I could never truely finish a whole jar of soda. Rather than that everything is good and so is the customer service."}
{"text":"We didnt get greeted respectfully this place is disrespectful ,  sat there for ten mins , so a girl randomly took out order .  Service aint changed since they opened   . Food aint that great .   Koolaid bomb  thats   !   I dont recommend here at all"}
{"text":"Unfortunately arrived here after a Friends recommendation and it was closed despite yelp saying it closed at 10pm...its 7pm Sunday... Maybe I'll try next time we come to LV"}
{"text":"While our waitress tried hard - it's obvious this restaurant lacks training and a focus on the customer.  We watched our appetizer delivered to the table next to us.  Then, the replacement also delivered to them.  When I asked - the answer was \"the kitchen is busy.\"  Then, was told, \"yes - your food ended up one table over, twice...\"  

Instead of paying for our app - the manager took $3.00 off our $10 item.  No apology, no invitation to give them another try.  So we won't.  

Drinks were wrong.  Food came out in three separate deliveries.  

Not impressed.  Too many other great options nearby where the customer is the focus.  Great service always pays off - tonight was a disappointment."}
{"text":"They are getting one star because the food wasn't actually bad. However everything else was not so pleasant. So here we go...
1. It was hot in the restaurant like to the tune of 95 degrees and after mentioning it to our \"bartender/ waiter he confirmed it with little apology. 
2. Total attitude from the bartender/ waiter he could use some training on how to actually be professional and engaging. Just saying...
3. The food runner actually handed us our plates vs placing them in front of us. Slightly tacky
4. My cocktail was finished well before our food was brought out but was not offered another until I asked for water so he was way late on the opportunity to sell another cocktail (his loss). 
5. The place was very empty but the staff seemed to be clustered around talking to each other. 
6. IT WAS SO HOT IN THE RESTAURANT. It really took allot away from the experience I was expecting. 

My prediction is this place probably won't be around very long. I won't be going back and recommend finding another option for super thin soggy waffles and really good chicken. Yeah, the chicken was decent."}
{"text":"First of all let me start off by saying when this place first opened it was the best chicken and waffle place in Las Vegas. Me and my family haven't been there in year prior to our recent visit yesterday. We got there at 10am Saturday had to wait over 30 mins to be seated due only two waitress working. While we were waiting their it a  was influx of people walking in on a Saturday morning. Everyone  was asking why is their only two waitress working right now on a weekend?  Also the host kept asking everyone were they over 21 so that people can be placed at  bar . We finally got seated outside and or waitress took 20 mins before she even got to us and keep in mind their was only three of seating outside. Finally order our food and the waitress didn't even check up on us we had to grab our own napkins and salt and pepper ( as well as hot sauce) she had no personality barely even talked to us. I had to get her attention to send my chicken back because it had hair on it still. Once she picked up our plates she didn't even say anything if we needed a to go box or was the food good. NOTHING! So I just sat there and waited on my phone until she asked me did I need a to go box after the second time she can back to get our checks. The food was ok waffles were soggy very disappointed. We eat out around the world so we are very knowledgeable about great customer service. Debra who wasn't even our waitress came around and asked if we were ok and told us to come back and ask for her. She most be the only great waitress there. ask for Debra!"}
{"text":"What a let down where to begin this place does have potential to be great and get A 4.5 star but not today they  got some kinks to work out i guess, The decor is real nice nice and open kool-aid on tap funny names for some of the food like the betty boob anyway started off taking a few sips of my drink and the wife noticed there was a lid from a to go cup in my drink weird but ok got a new one and kept it pushing i got the biscuits n gravy and i upgraded the eggs to cheesey onion eggs the food gets there and its just reg scrambled eggs no big deal send back ang get a pile of eggs with raw onion and cheese melted on top no thanks yuk on to the potatoes way well done seemed like they were premade then put back in the fryer to reheat but left too long as for the biscuits they were on point gravy was good the wife got the chicken n waffles and that was really good too. I would try this place again to see if they get it together but this time was a big fail"}
{"text":"Tried Lolo's for the first time today. Being from California and a fan of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, I had high expectations. I was pleasantly surprised although Roscoe's will continue to be number 1 in my book. Lolo's is a good alternative if you have a taste for chicken and waffles. 

I had 3 fried chicken wings with 2 waffles. The chicken was fried to an excellent crisp however it could have used more flavor. The cinnamon infused waffles were perfect! 

We had great service from our server Sparky. He had a lot of energy and a fun personality. His drink pitch enticed me to order a watermelon Kool Aid! I hadn't had Kool Aid in years. It was awesome and tasted like watermelon Jolly Rancher! 

I didn't try any other menu items so my review is based solely on their signature menu item."}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's serves up some pretty darn good fried chicken! After visiting a few times, my current favorite is chicken smothered in gravy, sooo freaking good! Perfectly crispy and juicy chicken smothered in gravy and onions. The mac n cheese, waffles, fried chicken are pretty good as well but the smothered chicken stole my heart.
Oh and their cocktail are pretty good too. They have some interesting selections like, Kool-Aid and gin.
Service is fast and friendly. The establishment is very clean, you can choose between booths, tables, and bar. I think some high tables too. Prices are pretty low, your wallet won't take much of a hit :)"}
{"text":"New to Lo-Lo Chicken &Waffles and we love this place. Good fried chicken and Purplesaurus Rex drink was awesome.  Pictured is the Ivan's Chorizo,  the Trey-Trey, Ice Tea, and the PURPLESAURUS REX."}
{"text":"I'm being very generous with this 3 star rating. I don't feel I should go down lower because I've been here only once and who knows maybe I went in on a bad day.

If it's souther style to give extremely bad service this place has nailed it. I sat in the bar area on a very slow Monday afternoon. After being seated by the hostess I sate there for 5 to 8 mins before even being greater by the wait staff. When the waitress finally came over there was no warm greeting or smiling face. I was obviously a burden in her very slow day. I waited another 5 mins to get my diet coke and the food came out shortly after. That was the only thing that did happen fast. 

The food came out a little too quickly. Like maybe it had been precooked and was sitting and waiting under a heat lamp.  It tasted like it had been too. The fries were stale and a few were very hard, like they were a day old. The batter on the chicken strips had little to know flavor. I had to drench them in hot sauce  and ranch dressing to get them down. The white brest meat inside was nice and juicy but all that flavorless dry batter was too much. 

The whole time I was there, about 40 mins the waitress only came over that one time, to take my order. I was so tired of waiting for the check that I got up and went to the hostess stand and had them get it for me. Needless to say i left a 0 tip and never in life have I left a 0 tip. 

It's you're choice, of course, but I would never recommend this place to anyone unless they want overpriced flavorless food and extremely bad service."}
{"text":"Needs work. Waited for our food to arrive for about 50 minutes. Food was alright, we kind of expected better. The presentation needs work. Our server was in the back most of the time, never got our water filled"}
{"text":"At 2pm on a Saturday, had to wait 45 minutes to get a table. Another hour waiting for food. We tried this location because it's closer to home.  Downtown Phoenix is faster.  Very disappointed I spent 2 hours of my life waiting to eat.  Btw - still waiting on food."}
{"text":"First we sat and waited for about 20 minutes before we were even acknowledged by the waitress. We were about to leave when she finally took our drink order. Then they screwed up my husbands order. The waitress was nice and corrected that but as I was eating my \"phat azz\" chicken breast sandwich, which they also screwed up on, I bite into a bone. The manager comes over and offers us free red velvet cake to go!! At this point we just want to leave so my husbands asks if there's anything else. She says \"well our go to is 10% off (assuming this happens a lot!) that's all I can do\" As she standing there I start cutting up my sandwich and she actually makes fun of me!! \"Oh look she's cutting it up now afraid to eat it!\" She never offered to take it off our bill or anything. Horrible experience and even worse management. Will never go back there and I'll be sure to share my experience with all my friends."}
{"text":"Can't believe I've been here a million times and have yet to review! This Lo-Lo's is the closest to home and the food/service has never done me wrong (despite what other reviewers have experienced). The deep-fried chicken is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside -- much better than the pan-fried chicken you'll find at Roscoe's. The waffles are absolutely delicious with a hint of cinnamon. And don't even get me started about the Kool-Aid! Bomb dot com with all options (Grape, Fruit Punch Red, Blue & Green Apple!!). For dessert, I recommend the banana pudding which includes Nilla Wafers mixed in and whipped cream on top. 

Adding to the awesomeness is the music choice, a nice blend of soul/R&B. In fact I have Lo-Lo's Scottsdale to thank for getting me hooked on Raheem Devaughn back on date nights with my wife back in 2010.

Next time you're around downtown Gilbert and your stomach is rumbling, come straight to Lo-Lo's. Despite what the Rolling Stones say, you will get some satisfaction here!"}
{"text":"THIS is why black restaurants fail. Wait is unacceptable, food ( I assume) unacceptable, service is unacceptable. I think a competent wait staff and cook line is the minimum in any restaurant. If you were not ready to open you should have changed the opening day of the restaurant!

My husband and I waited for 30 minutes before we were even looked at! I understand being busy, I was also a waitress, so i understand being under pressure and being a bit overwhelmed but to not even get a drink order started?! Come on! I cant review the food because i just walked out. If the wait staff is incompetent, I can only imagine the havoc in the kitchen! NO THANKS!"}
{"text":"This place was amazeballs!!! The chicken damn near made me emotional because it was almost as good as my mamas. The waffles were so delicious and that grape kool aid/gin concoction made me feel the need for a good nap. The menu is really extensive with a lot of excellent choices. But it was the service above all that will make us come back. Andria took care of us today and her hospitality and warmth was so appreciated. Her great sense of humor made us feel right at home. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food. Nice servers but sooo slow. I don't think it was his fault though seemed like he was running around busy while others slothed along. Would give a two if I didn't love chx and waffles"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken gizzards I've ever had. Been here multiple times and I always leave so full. Chicken is so good. Never a bad experience. Great portion sizes."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, the bad reviews nearly made me pass this up.  Boy, am I glad I didn't. My chicken and waffles was so good. My daughter loved her bacon cheese n mac. My son loved ours better than his, but, that's his fault for getting fries instead of a waffle. They lost a star for slow drink refills. Other then that, I'm bringing my family here again."}
{"text":"A couple of people at work raved about how Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles made it's way to Vegas and I had to give it a try.

I came on Friday around 3 and luckily that's when their Happy Hour starts!  (HH 3-6PM). Appetizers are $5 (except for the catfish beignets) and draft beer is $1 off.  We started off with some catfish beignets and fried gizzards.  And I opted for their namesake Lo-Lo's, which comes with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles.  

Catfish beignets: Large pieces of flakey catfish, with a nice crisp breading.  It comes with a dipping sauce that tastes like thousand islands dressing, but the best way to eat it is to douse it in hot sauce!  

Fried gizzards: Definitely an acquired taste if you aren't used to it.  It's a little chewy.  I didn't care too much for it because I was all over the catfish.  

Lo-Lo's: The 3 pieces of chicken were huge!  1 large chicken breast was enough to fill me up.   The breading was a little too salty for my taste, so I ripped off the skin and went straight to the meat.  The meat was tender, juicy, and seasoned perfectly (after getting past all the breading).  The waffles were a bit soggy (before adding any syrup).  I wish they toasted it a little longer to crisp it up.  All in all, soggy waffles wouldn't deter me from enjoying my meal.  Flavor was great!  I loved how the chicken paired well with the hint of cinnamon in the syrup and butteriness from the waffles.  

All in all, the food was just okay for me.  Service was a little slow despite the restaurant being empty.  My favorite part of the meal was enjoying old school R&B playing in the background."}
{"text":"Warning: DO NOT make the same mistake I did! A huge mistake we did was coming to this place on a Sunday afternoon so close to the opening of this place. It also seemed like, from the way all the patrons were dressed, that most might have been coming from Sunday mass/church, so lots of families and large parties were waiting.

We had an estimated wait of 45 minutes for our party of 5 when we arrived around 11:45AM but actually ended up waiting about an hour to be seated. After that, it took about 30 minutes for our food to arrive. Overall, service was very slow. It was understandable given how PACKED this place was. People were surrounding the restaurant waiting for the table, and you had to be present to hear your name being called over the mic. 

If you can avoid it, I would certainly advise against dining here on a Sunday afternoon.

After we were seated, Leigh, our server, greeted us and gave us our menus. 

Service 3.5/5 
I really have to hand it to her... that place seemed chaotic but she was doing a fine job in refilling my friend's coffee and giving us updates when our food was being prepared. I can't really accurately rate the service due to high volume activity, but I did feel like Leigh was trying her best.

Food 4/5
We ordered drinks first. They had kool-aid on tap (offered in grape, blue, and fruit punch). I chose the fruit punch but it was waaaayyyy too sweet so I had to really water it down to drink it comfortably. My friend ordered a lemonade and had to water hers down too, so be aware of over sugared drinks (to be expected in a soul food restaurant, I suppose?) Two of my friends ordered an Arnold Palmer with unsweetened iced tea and I really enjoyed it -- probably would be my choice of drink for the next visit.

I ordered the Baby Ray which came with 3 chicken pieces and 2 waffles. The chicken was drenched in gravy with some semi-carmelized onions as a topping. The gravy had what I believe was a hint of bell pepper to taste (I really hate the taste of bell peppers but this was tolerable). I ended up only being able to finish the thigh and wing part of the chicken. 

I only finished the thigh and wing part because the breast was not only way too much food for me, but it was also too dry.

Waffles were perfectly made and also quite large. I was able to finish 1 1/2 out of the 2 waffles. All this food was actually way too much and definitely put me in a food coma. Do note that I came here on an empty stomach and waited 1.5 hours to actually eat.

Ambience 5/5
Southern style everything! Mason jar cups, mason jar chandeliers... super super cute! I didn't have too much time to examine the restaurant but it was very upbeat and busy. Despite the amount of people in the restaurant and the noise level, I was able to hold conversations with my table which is great. I've been to restaurants that were just as packed but I wouldn't be able to hear the person next to me.

I also saw that they had an outside area, covered of course, which I would love to try when it gets a little warmer out.

I had a pleasant experience with the food and would love to give this place a try at a less busier time!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Best chicken and waffles I have ever eaten in Arizona"}
{"text":"Like most the reviews for this location, my experience was pretty much the same. Came in on a Wednesday night at around 5pm. It wasnt that busy, there was no wait for a table, which was a plus considering every other place nearby had a 45-60 minute wait.  After waiting almost 10 minutes, the waiter took my drink order and never brought my sweet tea. I was too busy trying to keep my two toddlers behaved that I didn't even bother to ask the waiter for it. When the waiter brought the drinks (waters) he dropped them at the table as quickly as he could without asking if we needed anything else, or saying anything for that matter. We only ordered two entrees. Chicken fingers with waffles and chicken and biscuits. It took 45 minutes after placing our order before we got our food. The waiter didn't check on us during that time didn't keep us informed on the status of our order, didn't refill waters or get us drinks. The tables around us were all waiting around too. We were right about to get up and just walk out since all we had after an hour of sitting was water. But of course, just as we're getting ready to do so, the food arrived. The food tasted on par with what I've had at other locations. I like LoLo's, and maybe willing to give this location another shot. I hope they have better service next time around."}
{"text":"We were stoked to try another new restaurant downtown Gilbert. What a let down!!!! From horrible waiter, (had to ask for water 3 times), never refilled my coffee. Mediocre food, tasteless chicken. Really? This is supposed to be like your mommas? Trust me, that's one momma kitchen I won't visit. I get that it just opened, yet this is a franchise that's been around for a minute, so there is no excuse. Beautiful building, great music. They have a long way to go. Such a disappointment.!!!"}
{"text":"Why this place has the stars I have no idea. This place is absolutely delicious. Don't believe the lies you read. Some people set out to ruin businesses especially CERTAIN types of businesses. The food is absolutely delicious. The best I've had since I moved here. I'm a great cook myself and so is my husband so we know great food. We loved it. The chicken the catfish greens Mac and cheese okra and dirty rice all on point. I will definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"First thing that comes to mind: Best sweet tea I've had in Vegas in 12 years. 
Fried. chicken. is. fried. Just the way I like it, crunchy/juicy chicken. House hot sauce is great too. Wife had mac-n-cheese with shrimp and bacon--she loved it. Biscuits were great. Fresh, homemade. 
Service was not spectacular but sufficient/friendly. 
Waffles were ok...cinnamon. The chicken was the star for me. 
Room was loud, but enjoyable.
Very close to a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"This place is so damn good. It's exactly what you'd get in the south. The amount of food is incredible & the amount of happiness matches at every level. You HAVE to get the koolaid. Don't complain about how sweet it is because it's made how it's supposed to be. Great service too!"}
{"text":"The first time eating here and I didn't want bones in my chicken so I ordered the one with tenders the Puffs Chicken Tender Bask, beat the lunch rush so it wasn't to busy when we got there. 

Well once I dug into my food I can taste the cinnamon flavor in the waffle and with the syrup and butter it was amazing and combined some bites with the super juicy tenders and they weren't average tenders these were massive pieces of chicken and it comes with barbeque or ranch and I had chosen barbeque. Started eating and when I did I put my phone down and enjoyed my food I had mixed the chicken with the waffle and it gave a whole new work of flavor and it was delicious. The only thing I didn't like to much, were the drinks that are a bit over priced..

They had very friendly staff and extremely comfortable atmosphere I would recommend this place (have already) and I would definitely come back here"}
{"text":"Literally THE WORST service I have ever had. Ordered our food 55 minutes ago. At this rate, I will never ever be back. I do not care how good it is once it arrives. You have pissed me and both of my children off.

Edit: had to ask TWICE to see the manager. She was completely worthless. I WILL NEVER BE BACK."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite restaurant! I would come at least once every 2 weeks ! Usually excellent service and food ! 

BUT TODAY WAS DEFINITELY TERRIBLE! They're under new management and no one knew what they were doing! We were the second ones to come in and we were served last waited over an hour for food! I ordered a sweet tea and they brought out an unsweetened tea I told her that I ordered sweet tea and she had an attitude and told me she'd come back with the right drink! 
It took them over 25 mins to bring back my drink and it was still incorrect! I asked another waitress if she can bring it and she put her finger in my face and told me to wait! My girlfriend ordered grits and catfish and it took them over an hour to bring it to her and they didn't let her know what was taking so long with her food! When they came out they just told her to substitute her side of grits because it's going to take too long! Never have I ever had a problem with this restaurant but I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN! Worst service ever ! Do yourself a favor and don't go here! If I could rate them a zero I would !!!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the gizzards, which is the only reason I went to Lolo.

The breading on the gizzards were extremely light, the breading had almost nonexistent flavor at all. The gizzards themselves were void of offal flavor as well. I am not sure how they managed that, but it isn't a good thing. The purpose of eating an offal organ is that distinct flavor. It did have this very subtle smoked wood taste to it. Maybe they add it in liquid smoke to the breading. The gizzards were cut, but they apparently left the rock pouch lining on one half of the cut pieces while the second half of the cut it was removed. That center portion should be removed completely. It is the actual lining of the rock pouch and is extremely chewy and gristle like. The gizzards were on the softer and most side but with a light chew. When you had the piece with the rock lining still attached it had that extreme chew to that portion. 
The quantity was pretty good.

Recommendations remove the whole piece of the rock lining when they are cut, add some spice to the breading. 
Whatever the heck you are doing to remove every bit of offal flavor stop! It is the equivalent of eating a burger with absolutely no beef flavor to it.

Sorry but these were just not good overall. The 25 minute wait time for them in a virtually empty restaurant also baffled me."}
{"text":"Very long wait for the food after our order. Half the food never came out. The waitress had no explanation as to what happened so I won't go and assume what happened. Just that the food never came out and our waitress never came out to check on us like most restaurants do after the food is served. 
The food finally came out about an hour after we sat down (yes, really). We immediately asked for a box and the check. We paid (in full-a discount was not offered to us) and left. 

This isn't the first time we've had a bad experience. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We took my Mother in law to lunch here yesterday, as usual Lolo's did not disappoint! Everything was so good. The appetizers were so good, we had the fried green tomatoes, fried gizzards and the catfish beignets. The gizzards were so soft on the inside but crispy on the outside, the perfect combination. Every plate we had was cooked to perfection and the portions were so large, we each took food home. My plate, the shrimp and grits were perfect! We could not have asked for a better waiter, Kelvin was on his game for sure! We love the ambience of Lolo's so relaxing but not a quiet place! Everything was perfect! It's always good to come back home."}
{"text":"Awesome the best Bloody Mary w/ bacon I might add. A bit pricy but the service made it worth it."}
{"text":"Out in Arizona visiting from California. Took my nephews out to lo lo's for lunch. Customer service was almost scripted near perfect. I was more hot than hungry so I left food on my plate but the food I ordered was exceptionally well prepared. I highly recommend this for everyone to try. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Had the \"Lo Lo's.\" The waffles were really good, but the chicken was disappointing. It came with 3 pieces of chicken. A wing, a drum stick, and a breast. Normally I prefer dark meat because it's usually juicier but the dark meat pieces were over cooked. I couldn't even finish the breast because it was so dry. 
The service was great. Everyone was super friendly and the music in the background was enjoyable as well.
I'm sure if I would have ordered something else, it may have been better, but for a place which has \"chicken\" in the name, I would expect better chicken."}
{"text":"First I'm only putting one star because the chicken is good. But the service is horrible. Our meals came out separate, my daughters food was burnt and after she sent it back it came back not cooked. Jai the server made no apologies. We never saw a manager, except he popped out for a moment to talk with other workers at a table.
Now I can understand why the place wasn't busy.
We will never return there again. Need new management"}
{"text":"Can't believe I waited over over an hour and a half and still don't have any food. I asked for the check and had to wait 15 minutes to speak with a manager who never came! Worst service I have ever had. I would give it a zero if I could. All I wanted was some chicken"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a handful of times . The food is usually really delicious. But they are inconsistent. Today I went and my chicken had a burnt taste . My rice was a bit hard. The customer service is always excellent. This is one of my favorite places to eat. I love the southern food. They just need to be consistent with the food . Make sure the food is always good. Also , please keep syrup to the tables :)"}
{"text":"New establishment in the Las Vegas area. There are still some minor details that they have to work on, but I must admit, the food is great. I have never had southern fried chicken soooooo delicious and juicy as theirs.  Decor is very relaxing, like I'm at a barn. There is always a wait every time we go there. I have to warn people though, they will not seat you unless everyone at your party is present.  There were six of us that met there and one of the ladies was parking her car., we informed the hostess that she was parking and she will just join us at our seat but she said that they will not seat us unless we were all together. Aside from that issue, everything went well.  The prices were very reasonable.  They serve Kool-Aid which I haven't had for years.  I ordered the Betty Boop meal. (yes, the menu consisted of the Nay-Nay, Lo-lo, etc.) If you are looking for comfort food, this place is a definite place to go."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and almost walked away... Glad we didn't. My wife and friends brought me here on a Thursday night for my birthday, and I couldn't have been happier. Our server (Jai) I believe was simply AWESOME! I told her about the negative Yelp reviews and she aligned and said they've grown a lot in a short amount of time. She checked on us regularly, our food was fresh and of course delicious. Never had a drink below half and banana pudding was on point. They do need some help at the front desk, better shift managers (they aren't the most friendly people) and a better \"peak\" strategy however if you can strike at the right time, food is well worth it!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent & the server was great. I only gave 4 stars cause the food took over 36 mins.. I was barley hungry after drinking so much beer.. But hands down a place you should put on ur list of restaurants to try!!!!!!!!!! (Mac n chz) amazing! Ill be back"}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome decor and interior is very homely. Food is absolutely delicious to include their genuine sweet tea. I've tried plenty of \"soul food\" restaurants across the country and this place is by far the best I've had. The gizzards were absolutely perfect! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Management Fail. What a disappointment. 9 friends including two from Socal who love LoLos. Put our name in at 10 am. Told 20 minute wait. No problem. Then 10 more minutes due to 'silverware outage'. Silverware outrage?! Then at least 30 more minutes because they don't know when they will have silverware. Spoke with manager, asked if they are really expecting us to wait an hour...zero ownership of the problem, said that it will be a while. Very disappointing to see a great Phoenix staple fail to scale. Will not patronize Gilbert location ever again."}
{"text":"1st tip: don't come here if you are in a rush. Don't come here hungry and ready to eat because food takes a while to come out. Our catfish appetizer was completely forgotten, my husband ordered the salmon croquetts he was very disappointed. I ordered a chicken & waffle plate.... Chicken was good but highly disappointed with the thin flavorless waffle.... We finished our meals hoping our appetizer would appear during... But we reminded the waiter.. And waited another 10 minutes for that. Last but not least we asked for target sauce... Guess how fast we got that.... Not sure if we'd go back."}
{"text":"The food was good and hot.  The seating area was very noisy.  Seriously could not have a conversation.  Server was very good. Almost did not try this place with 3 star reviews"}
{"text":"The food was great overall. 
I had the gizzers and chicken in waffles. I wanted the breast but they ran out and gave me wings. It was still great tho. The koolaids and lemonade was great but a little toooooo sweet for me."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed all my foods. Delicious waffles, juicy chicken breast, yummy buttermilk biscuit and gravy with eggs and house potatoes, red velvet pancake, and peach cobbler. I will be visiting again and again."}
{"text":"This place may be under rated.  Went on a Tuesday morning.  Nate was a great server! Nate was versed of the menu and checked on us frequently.  The atmosphere and outside seating option were a pleasant surprise.  The food was seasoned properly and was served hot.  Grits,  chicken,  and wake were on point! I love that the waffles were edible. The waffles were large in diameter not super thick,  the  flavor of the waffle was not compromised.  I loved the music,  the staff,  and bar area. Nice touch was having the chef come out and asked how the food  taste. I would recommend this venue to any and many to visit.  Weekends are busy but the food and atmosphere makes up for the possible wait times.  Try the Melon Mojito!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because I'm bored from waiting for my food for too long..... need to adopt a more systematic service to speed insanely long wait times. :( 

I'll update this later if or when I ever receive my food....

Update.... still haven't gotten my food and my gf is getting increasingly mad at me. THANKS LOLOS.

Final update: I spent about 10 minutes eating and waited a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes, just waiting for my food and my server to pick up the check. Chicken was good, fries were soggy, mac and cheese was good. Unfortunately the dreadful service does not warrant a revisit by me...."}
{"text":"A long awaited Sunday lunch turned out to be an afternoon of disappointment and waste of time. The restaurant is known for good chick n waffles but our food for five people took 50 minutes before we were served. Not to mention it took 15 minutes for the waitress to greet us and get our drink orders. We were so hungry we even ordered our food after she brought our drinks. When asked why it took so long, we were told it took longer because one of the orders was shrimp and grits. In other words, if you order anything outside the chicken and waffles, expect your order to be delayed. I was expecting our Waitress to apologize instead we were scolded by ordering the shrimp and grits. She said, \"we couldn't bring out everyone's C&W and not bring out the S&G could I?\"  

While eating our friends called us by surprise and said we are around the corner and would like to join you. I was so afraid to ask the waitress if it would take another 50 minutes to get two orders of chicken and waffles and she said no because you're not ordering shrimp and grits. Five minutes later she brought out chicken and waffles. It gets better, when our friends cut the waffles she found a long thick strand of black hair on the food. We showed it to our waitress she was apologetic. You would think the manager would at least show up for the first mistake for being 50 minutes late on the food but we never saw the manager apologized or even acknowledge us as a customer.   You see this Is an establishment that is badly managed. The service was bad because the management was bad. If you want to fix and improve the customer service then you need to get rid of the manager. It's too bad this place is located in a very high rent, high competition area and because of bad service and bad management they lose people like us who are frequent restaurant clients. I'm sure if you're familiar with this area located in Gilbert you could share some of the same experience because they been around for two years and I can't believe they haven't been able to fix the internal chaos within the restaurant. That's why I blame bad management. If you have 3 hours for lunch and don't mind specimen in your food, this is a ok place."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is great, the Koolaid and Iced Tea is the best, very large portions, the only reason i give them 4 stars is because it always takes long to get your order, that could be because they are always busy or because they want to make sure it is right, always worth the wait though."}
{"text":"I came earlier in the week for chicken and waffles with the hubby and then decided I had to come back for dinner to try the chicken fried steak. I saw how angry some yelpers were because of the wait on the weekend, so we went during the weekday, and we were seated right away both visits. 

I would definitely recommend the chicken and waffles. This is their specialty and for good reason. They know what they are doing with fried chicken. The waffles have way to much cinnamon for my taste, but a quality dish never the less. I saw the biscuits and gravy they were serving, that looked amazing,  and thought that the chicken fried steak dinner would have the same type of white gravy. So we made plans to come for dinner just a couple of days later.

The chicken fried steak was not my favorite........ I got the whipped potatoes and red beans and rice as my sides. The chicken fried steak was a quality product in and of itself. It was tender and the breading was good, but I really didn't care for the gravy at all. It was a brown gravy and not very savory and flavorful at all. I really didn't care for the sides either. The potatoes were very strange, not at all like mashed potatoes that I was hoping for. 
My husband had the DVZ's Hot Ghetto Mess for dinner. It is 6 wings with Chicago Style Sauce served over white bread, and a he added a side of mac and cheese.
I did taste my husband's mac and cheese, and it was good. It has a little kick to it with the added black pepper they use. 
My husband liked the wings, and was glad he ordered the sauce on the side. 

I really recommend the chicken and waffles, and probably sticking with the breakfast items. Those were our favorites and it is more their specialty."}
{"text":"Great Chicken and Waffles. Chicken is real southern fried style and waffles are the right size with just enough cinnamon to make you want more. The half sweet half unsweetened tea served in the large mason jars is fresh brewed and refreshing. 

We returned again yesterday and had an opposite experience. Poor server who spent most of her time working the bar and the food took forever to get to the table. Manager apologized but all we got was a verbal sorry and excuse that it was after 5pm on Sunday so they had to make fresh food. Sad thing is we got there long before 5pm and shouldn't fried chicken and waffles always cooked fresh?"}
{"text":"Chicken was too salty for my taste. The service was super slow. I wasn't really impressed. I now see why there are no Lo Lo's in SoCal. Probably won't be back. Roscoes it is!! So disappointed ."}
{"text":"attempted to order take out yesterday. 7 calls later still no answer. So I head on over. To their defense they were crowded but over the span of 25 minutes no one answers except the answering machine?!? We head in. One lady was at the hostess counter and a few outside waiting to be seated. 7 minutes before a waitress finally came over and asked if we were waited on. The one lady said yes she was waiting for take out n we said we wanted to order. She took our order. I ordered a #1 no eggs and a #3. We leave and come back. Waited another 4 minutes or so and they asked to help us. Get our food, head home. Open the bag and NO GRITS!! Im livid. Called 4x no answer. Due to this crappy service no matter how good the food is I will not be returning"}
{"text":"The service is terrible. Slow, unmotivated, and doesn't service/cater to customer. Worst customer service ever. Food is alright"}
{"text":"We waited an hour to get a seat, another hour to get our food. Our appetizer showed up after half of the people already had their food. I had waited years to try Lo-Lo's and read many reviews talking about how this was the greatest fried chicken on the planet, I was sadly disappointed. The fried chicken, Fat Azz sandwich and the fried green tomatoes had no seasoning. I would put Albertson's chicken above this chicken any day! Waffles were OK but not worth the wait here. Most of the staff were clueless and apathetic about the horrible service. I Will never return to this location and from the reviews of the Sky Harbor location I won't even waste my time there either. I am going to give the Scottsdale a try and hope they have got their act together."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible. Went for lunch and they were not busy. We still didn't have our food after an hour wait. We finally walked out. The server said that the computer was down and he finally just put the food order in by hand... after 40 minutes. Really? What exactly were you doing for the 40 minutes? I convinced my father to go here and he was really excited since he is from the south. We will never return to the Gilbert location. I'll stick to down town or Scottsdale. The manager of this one is lacking in leadership for sure."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this location. I typically have no issues with service, food, employees or the atmosphere. But a few days ago I came in and had a lady by the name of Charrae(sorry if spelling is off) as my server. She seemed as if my table was a burden or as if we were a bother. She seemed very rude and it sounded like she was like that to tables around us as well. She seemed more focused on talking to/being hostile to other employees. It was very uncomfortable to witness. I'm not sure if she is a manager in any way but it seems as if she was trying to act that way to other employees right by our table by the way she was talking or treating them - which was disrespectful. Correcting their mistakes, pointless comments, etc. There was one girl/server specifically who looked extremely upset or discouraged maybe after it seemed Charrae spoke with an attitude toward her. I really love LoLo's and hope to never feel this way or experience such a situation again. Server needs more professionalism and respect for both customers and employees. I'd hate to have to stop coming to this location. PS - the food was amazing per usual so comps to the chef."}
{"text":"We've been here two times before today and they just can't seem to get it right! We went when they first opened and thought it was ok, but the second time was horrible and said I'd never go again until...........

New management

5/27/18 First time back in forever and there's a line that took some time to move through. I was confused as to why, but the young lady in front is taking the names and seating the people as well. She finally gets to us and I tell her we're a party of 9. She then tells me they'll set up the table and it'll be 25-30 mins. A large party maybe 10-12 comes as I'm waiting and they go through the same process,  however they're sat immediately. I'm annoyed, but I ignored it because my full party hadn't arrived yet. They arrive and a host pops out and is asking if everyone has been helped... She noticed I was still sitting there and rushed away to get our table ready. We get seated at 11:45.  The server came over to take our drink order at 12:05. She forgot our straws and brought them in to go cups because they were out of the mason jars they use... she came back to take our food order at 12:20. My nephew wants pancakes but their machine was down soooooo no pancakes,  however his dad noticed that other tables got pancakes.  We're waiting and I notice the large party they seated before me is still waiting. They're starting to get agitated. The table directly to the left of us was still waiting and they were there for a WHILE, but their food is on the way to the table. It gets there and the young lady examines the plate then places it on the edge of the table, so they grab the first server they saw and tell them the order is wrong. she apologizes and tells her she'll go get her server and when she gets there she grabs their food, goes into the kitchen, then walks it out to another table across the restaurant. It's 1:30. I ask how much longer it'll be and I'm told it'll be out shortly. At 1:40 she passes me again. My brother tells her the kids are getting antsy and very hungry. She then tells us it'll be a while because there are a lot of orders before ours and it'll be another 30 minutes. That's when we decided to leave at 1:45.

Just never go there and you'll be fine; if you want chicken and waffles go else where to maybe Grits Cafe! Skip over M&Ms as I have a horror story about them as well."}
{"text":"Service is consistently great here. Lots of friendly faces. 

Our favorite dish tends to be the Stupid Fries! Fries served with a delicious brown gravy and strips of fried chicken. It's so good! 

Other dishes tried have been corn fritters and catfish beignets. I recommend the catfish with lemon and hot sauce. Never mind the sauce they serve with it."}
{"text":"I've been in Vegas 3 days and have at at Lolo's 3 times.  Great taste just like the locations from home.  Everything was great as usual .... The chicken, the catfish, the Mac and cheese, okra, grits and drinks all amazing like the AZ locations!

Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER GO BACK!!

If you like to wait over an hour for your table and then be ignored by all the wait staff then this is the place for you! 

My husband and I wanted to go there for dinner. We knew there might be a wait. After waiting patiently for our table in the cold we were seated in the back of the restaurant. At least 10 wait staff passed by without saying a word.  Not \"I will be with you in one minute \" or \"I need to drop off something I will be right back\". Not even our drink order was taken. After waiting 15 minutes, this is not acceptable!  EVER!!   After picking up our things we spoke to a \"Manager\" about the problem but all he could say was \"Sorry.\" He could care less. I always thought the \"customer comes first\" would imply but certainly not the case here!  When making a decision for lunch or dinner tonight, PLEASE DO NOT GO TO LO-LO's!"}
{"text":"The food looks better than it is. The service was terrible. Our waiter was either slow or high or a combination of both. I had ordered a sweet tea and he brought a regular one twice. Clearly he doesn't know the difference. The sides were cold. Somewhat a disappointment for the first time. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I was so happy I tried this place out. My daughter and I decided to pop in for dinner on a Wednesday night, so I figured we wouldn't have to worry about crazy wait times. I saw on the menu that the Chicken is made to order, so I was prepared to wait:-) We sat at the bar area and the bartender was very friendly. He even gave my daughter some cherries to munch on. I had a kilt lifter and my daughter had a pineapple juice while we waited for our meal. We ordered a Big Kid's Mac and Cheese for my daughter(plus a chicken tender on the side), I had Chicken topped with gravy and onions with a waffle, and we shared a side of corn bread.  The food(the fried chicken to be exact) was Epic! I am beyond thrilled that I gave Lolo's a shot! I also loved the gravy my chicken was smothered in! I hope my next Lolo's experience is just as amazing! I can't wait, I'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a must stop if you are in Las Vegas!!!!! The staff was super welcoming from the moment we walked in. Multiple team members checked on us often during our time here and our waiter always kept us up to date on the status of our order. Of course, the best part... the food was AMAZING! I had a waffle, eggs w/cheese, and a side of bacon and everything was perfect! I already want to go back!"}
{"text":"Went there this evening and had the worst service ever!!!! After waiting for 35 minutes for a table (I was ok with the wait), my sister and I finally got a table but had to wait 15 minutes for anybody to even greet us. We probably would've waited even longer had we not flagged down a bus boy. After our server, Alex, took our order he came back nearly 30 minutes later and asked us if we had ordered yet!!!! Seriously?!? Oh and mind you this was the first time we had seen our server since we ordered.  Nearly an hour after being seated we finally got our food!!! At least that was good. Our server never checked to see if we were doing alright or even if we had the right orders!!! He didn't come to check for refills or see if we needed anything, we needed more napkins by the way. Worst service I've ever had!!! I understand they were busy, but people around us were being better attended to than we were. We were ignored while our server cleared tables rather than help us. The only person in the whole restaurant who was actually nice or friendly to us was their bus boy Austin. Almost forgot to mention our server never apologized!"}
{"text":"The food is good once you DO! Get it. We have come here a couple times hoping that the service would improve. Yeah right!! We had to wait several minutes for the host to arrive to the empty hostess stand to seat us. Which is negligible, maybe she was busy right? Once we got seated we sat at the table for atleast 15 min before a server approached us with another tables food. Once we let her know we have not ordered yet, she just walked away saying wtf! Several seconds later another server approached us with another tables food yet again. Once we let her know as well that we have not ordered yet, and that no one has taken our order she came back and took our order. Little did we know our order was then passed to another server. They definitely need to step up their customer service game. 2 star rating only because of the (FOOD)."}
{"text":"Brought my mother-in law here for her visit and we truly enjoyed the good sized portions and great Service. I went with the classic chicken and waffles and I loved their crispy flavorful fried chicken! And the grits were delicious! Only thing is it could get a little pricey! $80 for three people.."}
{"text":"Just the best coffee I've had in a long time. Ordered 2 pieces chicken they were nice & crispy , the waffle was delicious ,not a thick Belgium , music a bit loud for 9:00 in a.m. Which btw this place doesn't open til 9:00. So it's a brunch sorta place...! Try it out !"}
{"text":"They said they were extremely understaffed.   We waited an hour and twenty minutes-- then they gave my granddaughter someone else's Waffle and chicken.. Thank goodness my three year old grandson fell asleep!   Wow it is horrible!!!  We saw a table walk out.... this is by far the worst service EVER!   I feel so bad for the staff but it was a total breakdown of communication with the kitchen and waitstaff- very DISORGANIZED!!!  My husband loves this place me not so much and after today I personally will not come back!   Sadly this place was pretty empty looks like it is soon will be going to go out of business.   Big question where was the Manager?"}
{"text":"First time eating here!! The chicken is actually really good, even the chicken breast was moist.  It was a little salty for my taste but still really good. Also had the Baby Ray which is fried chicken  smother in gravy and it was good. The waffles are big and sweet, and taste like cinnamon. The drinks come in really cute Mason jars.  The have Kool aid in several flavors, which is pretty cool and taste sweet."}
{"text":"We arrived as a party of 10. We knew this could be a problem, so we called ahead to let them know. They said they do not take reservations and that we can just show up. Once we arrived, we were told by the hostess, that since our party was over 8 people, we had a limited menu of 16 items. That just wasn't acceptable, so we got to speak to the manager. He explained any table over 8 people would stress the kitchen. This was a Monday at 9:45am. There was no stress going on. We asked him if he was OK losing a table of 10, over a simple technicality of 2 extra people, and he said that's the rule. He kept emphasising it was the rule. As we all turned to walk out, he said he would make an exception this one time, since it was still early and not busy. He acted like he was doing us a favor, making a complete ass of himself in front of our group.

To the food: I had the Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles. The meal that is also the name of the place. It comes with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. The chicken came right out of the fryer. It was incredibly juicy but had no flavor. It barley had any seasoning in the breading. The waffles were average size and had a hint of cinnamon mixed in. They were better than the chicken, but they were soggy. They were more like textured pancakes than waffles.

They have a variety of coolaid flavors to choose from. 3 of our party got the watermelon flavor. No one could finish it because it was way too sweet.

At the time of this review, they have only been open for about 4 weeks. You can really tell that not every employee knows what's going on yet. There was a table of new hires right next to us going through orientation. I will give it a month or 2 for them to work out the kinks and try one more time.
It is just a shame a restaurant with chicken and waffles in the name, has no so good chicken and waffles.

Oh yeah, they do not have there liquor license yet. So don't expect to get a drink."}
{"text":"ugh. now l remember why i don't come here. SUPER slow service and over priced. 2 people for breakfast. I had pancakes that came with a choice of breakfast meat and my wife had an omelette. No toast with the omelette, no home fries either. We even drank water. $28 dollars. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is racist against white people.

And this theory does not count to those who bring a long an African-American person with them if they are white. 
It only works if you're a white man standing there alone. Andrew. Commonsense is thrown  right out the window.

They started laughing at me when they found out I was waiting more than half an hour for food and one person called me a cracker. Too bad that any event like this would never make the news because it's a white person being discriminated against so I will just listed here and I'm sure that this listing will also get deleted somehow. But yes I am definitely stating that I felt completely discriminated against due to my skin color. 
I came And after I had placed an order to go over the telephone and I was told at the front counter that it would just be a moment. 
No one even acknowledged my existence after that except for pointing and laughing from the back near the kitchen. 
I stood in one spot for half of an hour and when I did ask somebody how much longer it would be even though I had called the order in an hour ago she told me to wait one second and she would be right back with an answer and then I saw her serving tables.
I was practically except for three others the only Caucasian male in this restaurant. I counted when I started realizing what was going on.
I ended up telling them to never mind on my order and then I left due to embarrassment when I saw one African-American male literally point at me and said \"this cracker has been waiting where is his food.\"
It's too bad no new station whatever pick this up but just be aware I experienced exactly what I said I have no reason to lie it was very very uncomfortable.
If you want Greek food there's 1 million other restaurants around Lolos chicken and waffles. Lolo... What does that even mean? Is that in English word? 
DONT EAT HERE!

*ANDREW S- you cross the line sir. Let me explain to you why. You may not get this or understand it but I will make sure that you do by the end of this. You just slandered my name. Defamation of character is the legal term/slanderous. Everything you have said that I said as far as me being violent and making threats and also that I am a racist is now in print by your hand. This makes you liable for slander/defamation of character. Not only are you liable but yelp is as well. Here's the best news. I am an attorney and this is my specialty defamation lawsuit. Andrew I hope you have some money because every Day that it remains in print labeling me as a racist for the public to see and also saying I should be banned from a store because I am a danger to others Is a horrible slander. This is an attorney this is what I do. Unfortunately you cannot change any of the text that I wrote to you not once did i say anywhere or eluded to Me being a racist. I'm not going to explain myself here but if you knew my personal life you would know that is not the case. Andrew you can report me all day long to yelp but I have a feeling that yelp will remove your post before they do mine. I found you on Facebook now I know you are so I will proceed with the lawsuit it does not cost me a dime and it will be good exercise for me in court I could use the practice usually everyone else at my firm does the work for me this time I'm taking it personally. In this day and age You need to be careful about what you say about people because it will in the end in fact come back to bite you. I don't want you to remove your post I want you to leave it up there where you say your slander and or defamation that I am a racist every day that goes by means more and more damages in the end. Damages just so you know is what is the most expensive part of a lawsuit. I have lost sleep over this I have not eaten since I read your post and I may have to seek therapy because of what you said about me. The longer you leave the post up the more money I will receive in the end this is a slamdunk deformation/slander lawsuit if you don't believe me call in attorney and ask but just make sure you give them the ACTUAL FACTS Before proceeding. Your childish behavior and actions including blocking me as well as your damaging words have impacted my life in many ways to this point. Next step is a subpoena it will be a certified letter sent to your door explaining exactly what I am suing you for."}
{"text":"It's a cool environment.. The outside red chairs are uncomfortable. The waffles are amazing.. The grits are amazing.. And the gravy was out of this world.  The dark meat chicken is great.. But I almost choked on the breast .. It was so fn dry.. I could barely swallow it.  The potatoes were just al

***update***. The server messed up my order, and then I got an omelet, but the cheese wasn't even melted.  The cheesy grits tasted mediocre.. They forgot my extra waffle, and charged me for it. For these prices, the food isn't all that great.  I probably won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Great service and good comfort food. We tried fried tomatoes and chicken and pecan waffle. Mine was cooked perfect nice and crispy, no oil or sogginess. But my beau was not that crisp but still good he ended up stealing mine."}
{"text":"I really liked Lolo's. The atmosphere was phenomenal! I really enjoyed the outdoor seating! The menu was great & gave our party quite the laugh! But with regards to chicken & waffles I really don't comprehend all the hype. The food was good but not something I couldn't live without. I guess it is unique & I like that & I also like that downtown Gilbert has become such a fun & happening place! For me Lolo's was fun but I can't see myself craving it or going back very often. It's more of a once a year thing for me or special occasion! But I'm glad to have finally experienced it to know!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with the overall experience. The service was slow, it took about 40 minutes to get our order and once we got it the food wasn't all that. We ordered the mac and cheese with shrimp and the waffles and chicken. The Mac and cheese had soo many onions that it was overwhelming. The onions were not properly chopped either. There were some big and small pieces all over the plate. This dish was also plain and lacked flavors. The chicken and waffles were also average. The only decent part was the juiciness of the chicken, bur it was still not worth it. 
They also offer breakfast all day, which per the menu pictures looked really good. But again the service and quality of the food were so bad that it might not even be worth the trip to try some of their packages."}
{"text":"Went to have brunch with my fiancé and had the privilege of being served by who we assume is the manager since she was the only one wearing a bright pink shirt. After waiting almost 40 min for an order of the banana pancakes and a Betty boop we decided we'd be better off eating elsewhere. We were never checked on or told that the food was taking a little longer than expected or any type of assurance. It'd be understandable if it was extremely busy and what not but tables that were seated prior to us received their food before we did. Not a great experience seems this location is always providing poor customer service."}
{"text":"Food is great... Service is to die for. Literally you will die before you get service.

We are sitting here now and have gone 30 minutes and 4 requests waiting for coffee... This place is empty on a Saturday morning and they runout of coffee? 

We haven't seen our waiter in 20 minutes and we finally flagged down the manager 10 minutes ago with our request... Haven't seen him since. 

Screw this place."}
{"text":"Ravin made the experience that much more enjoyable. She made the good food great. Get her if she's available."}
{"text":"Great experience during brunch siting at the bar. Talion was extremely busy and had no help but was still able to address us whenever we needed anything. He was great. I was only upset about the manager on duty not helping the situation. Talion was extremely backed up and had no help. The manager asked if I needed anything and I did not see him for the rest of the night. I won't give less then 5 stars because Talion was that good. Thanks for the great drinks."}
{"text":"I read all the bad reviews, and it almost kept me from trying out this location. I'm so glad I didn't listen!!! We went later in the evening after the dinner rush around 7:30. My son had the Oreo pancakes and they were amazing! Idk if they were $13 amazing, but really yummy. I had the Betty boob with Mac and cheese and cornbread. Everything was delicious, the cornbread was just eh... A little pricey for chicken, but worth it!!"}
{"text":"Always passed by this place whenever I'm in Lake mead, it was still morning and a \"quick fix\" McDonald's breakfast didn't sound very appetizing. Plus it was right across the street!

Employees were very welcoming and we were seated very quickly, my friend told me a phrase from Rush hour (the first one) where the two Asian people ask Jackie Chan if he knew where \"Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles were at\" but I don't know if there is any correlation with that and this place HAHA. 

Any-whoo~

Just as the restaurant name, we HAD to have the chicken and waffles hahaha, and goodness gracious it was fulfilling! 3 pieces of fried chicken and 2 stacks of waffles! Hot syrup on the side, with a scoop of butter on top! (I prefer buttery waffles so I asked for more butter)

The drinks even come in glass containers which is pretty cool!

Will return soon"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it's great. Service is awesome, food is delicious and atmosphere is pleasant. Will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken & Waffles, and I was impressed at how good it was.  Also ordered the Stupid Fries and they were terrific.  I will definitely return and try a different plate.  Had an awesome server and the place is nicely decorated."}
{"text":"If you want a great yummy breakfast with excellent service, come here! No wait at breakfast and they have a big mug of coffee ready for you.  Don't feel like chicken and waffles, then order something else on the wide variety of items. 

Enjoy the MoTown Music and fun spirit of this place.  

Well come back for for lunch and dinner too!"}
{"text":"Go here!! You won't regret it!!! The food is amazing and the service is too! My husband and I ride our bikes here for breakfast on Sunday. They play southern gospel music on Sunday and we think that's great!"}
{"text":"I love Lo-Lo's. My girlfriend and I come here every time we are in Vegas.  Good food and great wait staff. Keep up the good work.  We are rooting for you! And Debra was fantastic."}
{"text":"I like the food. Hot sauce is good. Warm syrup is a  nice little touch. Hostesses are nice. I work in the service industry just expected a little more from the bartender. 1. Printed my check 1min after ordering (didn't ask if wanted or needed anything else) 2. Waited until I was just about done to check if food was to my liking. 3. Didn't ask if needed change (payed 20 for 13) left it as it was anyway. Bartender was not busy at all."}
{"text":"Some may take this review as a bit harsh but I just think this visit is our last and it is really due to a few reasons that will likely not be fixed. The place was busy, wait was long and we still put our name in. Two seats opened at the bar, we grabbed them. The bar top was filthy, I mean like syrup, and crumbs, dirty napkins and was never cleaned. I made it beyond clear it needed to be cleaned, my boyfriend ended up taking an ice cube out of his drink and sopping up the mess with that and a dirty napkin left behind... unacceptable. The bartender was swamped with bottomless mimosas ordered every two seconds. My bacon bloody was underwhelming and the bartender said \"bacon is so fresh and hot, right out of the kitchen\" it was indeed not. It was sitting out in the open on a cold plate and was cold and had been there since they opened the doors two hours plus earlier which is fine, had I not been lied too. We had to ask for napkins for our appetizer and dish, we had to ask for silverware for my boyfriend's main dish ( he got a biscuit breakfast sandwich, it was decent), my better 2/3's finally just pulled out his card and handed it over so we could leave since no bill was ever presented as we sat there with empty drinks and no food. The open, loud, unorganized atmosphere and poor service (though friendly) did not even out the corn fritters and breakfast sandwich as something, even though good, Worth ever coming back for. Too many other options in life. Next...."}
{"text":"I just can't love this place. I don't dislike it, but I don't love it. I've been to their other location, and I felt the same about it there. Their food is fine- nothing exceptional, but nothing bad. I've had better chicken and waffles, both locally and abroad. Their waffles are unexceptional- they're just... dough. Their chicken tastes about the same- bland. 

I also had one of their other breakfast offerings, and it was pretty good! Their biscuits and potatoes are really tasty, and it's sort of a shame that they play up the 'Chicken and Waffles' bit so hard at the expense of their other food. 

I feel like this place tries to hard. All the names on their menu seem really gimmicky. Everyone who we talked to was really friendly and the service was good, but I just don't imagine coming back here when there are better offerings elsewhere in town."}
{"text":"Excellent food great people I really had a great time and whenever I am in Las Vegas it is my go to spot for some down home cooking..."}
{"text":"The food is good most of the time. But the service here has really suffered. The last time we went, we left our babies teether toys in the middle of our table. My MIL came in physically about 30 mins after we left and was told that the toys were never found. One of the toys was a rattle with sentimental value as it was a rattle used by my husband when he was a baby. My husband, who has experience in the service industry calls and speaks to a manager who says she spoke to the busboy and the busboy claims there were no toys. Now my husband gets angry because we know we left them there and demands that the manager go through the trash. Of course the manager was not thrilled. She did find our toys in the trash. So the bus boy was not only a lazy ass who didn't go above and beyond by saving our toys but actually lied about it. We aren't planning on coming anymore although my MIL still loves the place."}
{"text":"Great service...the crowd is waaaay different than the Phx location but food is the same. I only order side dishes (greens, candy sweets and macaroni and cheese) but the chicken freshly fried is delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome of course. Chicken and waffles, with the hint of cinnamon. They got kool-aid But I opted for lemonade this time. We got seated fast, the waitress was real chill. Had a great lunch"}
{"text":"Giving this dining experience ONE star feels like giving this establishment too much credit. This was probably the worst brunch decision we've made in a long time. The front counter was impossible to get to when we walked in (people standing everywhere) the wait time was supposedly 20-30 minutes. Finally, after 45 minutes, a spot opened at the bar, so we sat there instead. 10 minutes later, we still hadn't been acknowledged or the counter in front of us cleaned. We decided to try and be seated at a table instead, and it still took over 10 minutes for a server to come to us (after she got drinks for 2 tables that had been seated after us). There was no, \"Hi, how are you?\" Just a \"do y'all know what you want?\" 
We ordered the spicy corn fritters and when they arrived, they were ice cold on the inside. When we told the waitress, she just took the basket and walked away. Then my gf had ordered the salmon croquettes and, while they smelled fishy, there was hardly any actual salmon inside, but it had plenty of inedible ingredients. 


Next time we'll just go to McDonald's next door."}
{"text":"Went to Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffle the day after Thanksgiving. I was in town visiting family. I am told there is usually a long wait to get in. Due to the holidays there was no line.  We made reservation in advance we we arrived our table was ready. The seating host was very nice and accommodating to our party. We were then created by the friendliest and most helpful waitress. She worked really hard. We placed our orders for the food and waited about 30 min for our food to be served.  Meanwhile we had a few drinks off the menu entitled (dranks) it was kool aide with a kick. The drinks were surprisingly delicious. The food was plentiful I had the fried chicken wings, greens, yams, and macaroni and cheese. I really enjoyed the meal.  The greens were seasoned to perfection. I am not a fan of sweet cornbread but it was served warm with butter for those who like cornbread that taste like cake.  One of the other highlights of the meal was the smothered chicken and waffles. Someone else at our table ordered it and said it was delicious. So if you are ever in vegas staying on the strip it would be worth it to catch an uber to Lo Lo's for some good tasting soul food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in service and food. We ordered the chicken tenders, fries and beans & rice. Food was Luke cool. Also the ghetto wings were chicken wings with a tomato sauce poured over them. Our son ate one wing and said these were probably the worst he had ever had. I ordered the butter corn and got a bowl of corn with a scoop of butter that never melted. Getting someone to wait on us was very difficult, although there was several large parties at 4:30"}
{"text":"Finally a place with good Chicken & Waffles in Vegas!!!!! And they have Kool-Aid....talk about pleasing US ALL. We love it here! Granny is happy, she gets her fried chicken, mom and dad are happy. Kids love it. Great location. Thank you for blessing us with your hospitality!!! Perfect for after a long day of games, after a long work day, or if you're just trying to get away and watch some sports with your meal. Perfection the food is so fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner tonight and were seated immediately which was great...they can be really busy on weekends so we weren't sure if the same would apply for the holiday. The food was delicious as it usually is at lolo's, and the service was great as well. Lorenzo was our waiter and he didn't miss a beat. We were very happy with this visit and will be back."}
{"text":"Ugh!!!!! Please change your name to Lolo's Crayons and Water. They advertise endless mimosas and apparently ran out of champagne. How'd you run out? WE GOT THERE AT 12:45pm!!!!! I can see if, at a chicken and waffle spot, somebody asked for grass-fed beef, dim sum or a Choco Taco but we ordered CHICKEN, WAFFLES and some combination of the two!!!

The ONLY reason I didn't give this a 0 is because it's technologically impossible to do so on this app. We had 10 people and only 2 plates delivered from 12:45 to 2:08pm. 

The waiter tried but he couldn't make up for us not getting our food. The coloring books and water couldn't overcome the kitchen inefficiency.

To make matters worse, we asked for a manager 3 times and the coward refused to come to the table to at least address the fact that there was an issue...just stayed in the back."}
{"text":"Soggy waffles. Flavorless chicken. Since that's their specialty, that's pretty messed up"}
{"text":"2 stars because the food is great as it normally is on any given day but the service stunk. Sorry about that kitchen staff. My family and I know we normally have a wait to get seated on a early Sunday afternoon but it was what happened after that really counts. Seated in a booth by the kitchen out door. Our waiter finally stopped at our table after about 5 minutes of cashing others out. He stopped for our drink order which we gave him and I asked if we could give our food order as well. He said \"No but I'll be right back.\" On the way to the back he stopped at another table of folks that were seated after us and took their drink and food order. Seemed like 5 minutes later our drinks came and I asked to give our food order but he walked off. He dropped off a food order at another table that came in after us. Then he took our order. While waiting we saw our waiter take food to two other tables that came in after us then he came by our table. He refilled our drinks and asked if everything was OK. I said \"NO\". That 3 tables had that were seated after us had their food and I was wondering where our meal was in the progress of getting it delivered to our table. He disappeared. One of my young men and my lunch was delivered quickly then but not the other two orders. Oh man. Out comes the manager. She gets down in my other young mans face and in a condescending voice told him that his order takes 16 minutes to make as it's a made to order meal and it should be here soon and asks if he would like some cornbread or a biscuit. Totally ignored me. About that time my wifes meal shows up. I piped up and said well, two of the three tables that were there after us have their food already and one of them has paid and left. Her mouth opens and her eyes narrow but at that time my other young mans meal shows up and she says dripping syrup from her voice, \"Well! Would you look at that! Everything is here now.\" and she walked off all bubbly. She still never acknowledged that I was there at all. I think it will be awhile before we visit that LoLo's again."}
{"text":"Hands down best chicken and waffles out there. If you're in the desolate city of Phoenix by chance and want to remove yourself from an existential crisis or potentially change your religion to Waffleism this is the place to go. Also if you're y'all you won't have a problem with hitting ceiling lights as they are suspended at a decent elevation."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! This food was soooooo delicious! I live in LA so when i saw this place on INSTAGRAM I told myself that I had to try it my text Vegas trip. So I did! The service was excellent, the restaurant is really nice& clean, the menu is great with awesome selections. My husband and I both had a cocktail and they were really tasty and kinda strong. We left with our stomach on full and feeling right! 

If you're considering dinning here, do yourself a favor and go! Your stomach will thank you!"}
{"text":"Food was good and chicken wasn't  dry this time. Matt our waiter was fantastic. The only complaint we have is the flys. Atmosphere good, restaurant looked clean and fresh along with a great location."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it!!! Read the reviews and was hesitant, but had to try it. My husband went to the old location in Scottsdale years ago so we were pumped to go to the NEW Gilbert location. Love the decor and overall feeling of the restaurant. Personally I would have added more booths, because I do not like sitting out in the open. 
Server was good. Apparently few are better than others;).... So, may need improvements there Lo-Lo's. BUT, we will be returning because I saw something on the breakfast portion of the menu that looked BOMB!!!! 
Prices for drinks are a little pricey, but they are very big mason jars filled to the brim and refills are available of course. Serving sizes and prices and proportionate and I think worth every penny."}
{"text":"Visited Lo-Lo's Las (Vegas) on Sunday,June 24 on our way back to San Diego, we wanted to see what the \"Hype\" is all about, our experience got off to a very rocky start. By the end of brunch, we were FANS!!!! food was fantastic, good fried chicken(NOT) as good as my NaNa's Ha! but still great. Food was reasonably priced, Kool Aid on tap and SUPER moist red velvet cake. Thank you KJ for putting on your cape and coming to the rescue. We are looking forward to visiting this location and others again!
I did not give 5 stars because of the rocky start. WE will be BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal. As long as you only order chicken and waffles in any combination it's 4 stars or better. If you order ANYTHING else (shrimp and grits, fried okra, etc.) it's 1 star. Just stick to the stuff that's literally in the name of the place and you'll be fine. I've learned from long experience that you don't order a steak at a seafood place, you don't order a cheeseburger at a Chinese restaurant, etc. You get the point. You won't be pleased and this lesson is reinforced every time I ignore it.
Also, the service can be anything from awful to acceptable but is rarely excellent."}
{"text":"Great food and really great service!  Sparky was absolutely fantastic! Chicken was crispy and well seasoned. Our food was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"1st official day of this restaurant being open.  I expected glitches and flaws. What me and my husband experienced was a friendly, pleasant staff (shout out to Joanna) good service and fabulous food. We got here at 6 pm and we're seated in about 20-30 min. Not bad.  I was impressed how together they were. Hats off to the management and staff. I WILL be back and have some more of that lip smackin, sticky finger lickin, slap somebody's mamma good food!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. But I will say I LOVE THIS PLACE from the outside, into the doors, to the hostess. I don't live in Vegas, but I come once a month for about a week to visit my family and fiance, so I always know I have to stop here and eat my cheesy eggs, hash brown, waffles, and catfish!!! Just typing all of that made me hungry and I wish they were out here in California. The customer service has always been A-Plus and everyone is so nice They also have alcoholic drinks, a bar, and music and or the TV on. The atmosphere is nice and pleasant and you could always go there for games and big parties. They have an outside patio with mist to cool off with too. You could purchase shirts, mason jars, and hot  sauce!!! I totally love this place. Outside is nice, clean, and inviting. I will forever be a fan of this place!! I would have photos, but I eat my food so quickly, I would only have an empty plate as my photo, lol"}
{"text":"First impressions all everything. Once I entered the restaurant I was not greeted or welcomed and it was 4 employees at the  hostess counter. Once I let them know how many people were in my party  (12) two of the employees tried to discourage us from staying. Then told me it would be a very long wait.  One employee stated that parties of 8 or more will not be seated together and if we did we could only order certain things off the menu. To my surprise I asked why? She stated because anything that was not number 1-16 would back the kitchen up. My first thoughts was were not eating here, but it was my nephew's birthday so we waited it out.  After a 45 minute wait and many empty tables we were seated.  It took 10 minutes after we were seating for our waitress to even acknowledge us. Once we did order she told us they didn't have any alcohol which was clearly advertised on the menu. When our food came out she forgot two of our orders. Then two of the orders were completely wrong. The food was okay nothing spectacular. The pancakes were very dry and the sausages were under cooked. The shrimp and grits was good,  but greasy. Maybe things will get better after a couple months of them being open, but I will not be back."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed in our service last night. Went around 4pm to beat he rush, which we did. There were about 5 tables total, so they weren't busy at all.

1) Sat us right by the kitchen. Hostess basics 101- no one wants to sit by the kitchen.

2) waitress was prompt to get our drink order. Ordered two adult beverages. 15 min go by and no drinks nor was anyone at the bar making our drinks. We Hunted down the waitress- she brought us water finally. 
Aaaaand out comes 1/2 our food before we even got our beer and mojito.
Really?

3) max n cheese was luke warm
4) brought my husbands mac n cheese, cornbread and grits- waitress comes back by and asks if we need anything else... um yeah the rest of the food???
She checks and says the cook dropped the waffle and had to make another. Lol

5) so we wait for the chicken and waffle and eat the 1/2 of the food we have.

6) they also didnt bring the sauce that goes with the appetizer item we ordered, had to ask for that.

7) no kids water was brought- do they not have kids cup or did he waitress just not know to bring one for a small child?

8) had to ask twice for a to go container.

Such a disappointment for our dads weekend dinner."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the reviews are not higher, excellent fried chicken! I got the Betty Boob and it was delicious....the fried chicken is insanely crispy and just the right amount of salt. The waffles are soft and a bit undercooked for my liking but when it's covered in butter and syrup it doesn't really matter. The sides were pretty good but if you're coming here, you come for the chicken (and sweet tea)!!"}
{"text":"We arrived there and they said it was a 35 minute wait. My friend gave the hostess her # so that they could text when our table was ready. It was hot as hell-o out so we just decided to stand in the small waiting area right by the host area. After 45 minutes of waiting, my friend went to ask the hostess about our table, and she said she texted 9 minutes ago and gave away our table. Like..whet? #HowSway? We were standing right there & received not one text. My friend even gave the hostess her name as well as her number when we checked in. They need a better system for that. And the waiting area is small. Anyway, I got the 2 wings, waffle and a side, which I got mac & cheese. Read the reviews and people were saying that their waffle was \"soggy\". I just asked the waiter to have them cook my waffle longer and it came out perfect. My wings were small and not that seasoned. I doubt they came from a full grown chicken lol. The waiter was nice. He said people call him 50 b/c people say he looks like 50 Cent, but I called him by his gov't name b/c I don't know him like that."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed, I've been here for 30 minutes at the bar.  No one has taken my order except one girl that says she will take my order but she doesn't really know how to do it!  She says everyone here is new and nobody really knows what they are doing!  This restaurant has been in business way too long for this type of customer service.  I will never come back here again!"}
{"text":"Anytime you go to a grand opening of a restaurant you have to be patient. Nonetheless.... This was a great idea for Vegas residents, I have many friends who have went to Roscoes and wondered why they wouldn't open one here. Smart move. Food was great, loved the drink choices. Also our server \"Tinisha\" was wonderful. She was very patient. The kitchen was running behind and she gave us constant updates. She was very friendly and personable as well. Even though it was busy she still took the time to check on us and even have small talk.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles, shrimp and grits and a breakfast waffle sandwich were ordered and was all tasty.  The shrimp and grits were spicier than expected but were good and very filling.  The grits were not creamy, as we expected, but dryer type.  Chicken and waffles and breakfast sandwiches were good.  Our waiter was awesome and worked with us on the best values, etc.  Great location and we sat outside so perfect evening."}
{"text":"Worst food and drinks ever. Place was dead and still waited way too long for food. Gizzards had a weird texture and not sure how you can call a catfish nugget a beignet. My husband and I suffered all night after that meal. So LoLo's is a officially a hell no no!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!  Got a mojito drink to start, full of fresh mint and really good.  Ordered the chicken and waffles of course, the carbs were dynamite. Worth the extra cardio I'll have to endure!  Sat at the outside seating, really nice atmosphere and the staff was super friendly. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Great food. Currently serving a limited menu.  Chicken was hot and fresh. Waffles were tasty but flimsy.  Large breakfast menu.  Kids loved the koolaid."}
{"text":"First time at Lo-Lo's, and they didn't disappoint. Had to try some of the classics, so I opted for a KK's: Three piece  southern style, two waffles, grits & two eggs with cheese and onions. The chicken and waffles were obviously their staples, and they were oh so tasty. The eggs were a little bit overcooked (ordered over medium, yolks came out solid) but the grits were great with just the right amount of butter. Unfortunately, the sweet tea was not so sweet as the tales suggest, and oddly enough, was actually different color in each of the three glasses that we ordered...

Overall I think this first experience was enough to warrant a return visit to try their shrimp and grits..."}
{"text":"Placed a to go order and was told the order would be ready in 15 minutes. It was not it was more like 30 minutes but I understand this place gets busy at times the girls at the door or friendly enough but honestly I feel they don't understand what's happening our attendant was all over the place when I received my food and left the property I realize they didn't give me the drink I went back and got the drink only to drive all the way home to realize they gave me the wrong order . I ordered fish with fried mushrooms I received chicken with some kind of gravy . I called the restaurant to speak with the manager twice no one picked up the phone."}
{"text":"A little slow on the service but the food is outstanding.  Highly recommend the Betty Boob and the Soul Platter.  Their chicken is outstanding.  We will be back....."}
{"text":"Took over 30 minutes to get our food, chicken was hard and crunchy and the grits was under cooked."}
{"text":"This needed to happen. Ever since Scottsdale shut down all of their fried chicken joints (albeit one kfc was left in old town) I have been high and dry on my greasy fried chicken fix. Who the hell doesn't like fried chicken? Really Scottsdale? Do I have to go to urban hip restaurants to get my expensive fried chicken fix these days? And those restaurants always have bone dry fried chicken, bland seasoning....blah. Snobs don't know what real fried chicken is and this place has it. Great chicken, great waffles, cool interior, and damn good gravy. Just a heads up, the kool-aid is approximately 74.3% sugar so it's nice and thick as it goes down....only knock I have is that it takes soooo long to get your food some days. And not just busy days. Last visit the restaurant was less than 1/4 full and still took 35 minutes to get my food. Otherwise keep it up!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and the service staff was friendly and greeted me as soon as I walked in. I believe this was a soft opening because they only had a limited menu so that's why I give four stars instead of 5. Onto the food, I got the #8 and a side of collard greens. The breading on the chicken was the proper ratio of crunchy, soft, grease, and bread. The chicken breast was plump and juicy. The waffle was light, fluffy and had a hint of some flavor I couldn't quite detect. I ultimately decide how good a soul food joint is by their collard greens. These were perfectly cooked. Salty and spicy were two most prevalent notes. Overall I'm thoroughly impressed and will be returning to try more things 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a more fun version of Los Angeles' infamous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles! This location is right down the street from me and I've wanted to try it for so long. In my mind I was just picturing it to be like Roscoe's (which I did not understand the hype and hated going to it because I did not like waiting over an hour to be seated), but to my surprise was better than I imagined.

The menu is fun. My sister and I sat there laughing at all the clever names that they named their dishes. My boyfriend ordered the DD (not pronounced Dee Dee but Double D), two chicken breasts with a waffle. Hilarious! I ordered the Little C, the smaller version. =P

The sweet tea and water are served in Mason jars, which I loved! Our waitress Karen was very friendly and provided great service. Peaches, the hostess was hilarious and quite entertaining. They made it a quite pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that dispute what follows, Star was a decent waitress. DECENT. However, the experience me and my party went through was horrendous. Food coming out incomplete, drinks consistently empty, orders wrong, waiting on necessities to consume my meal. That's just the big stuff. Let's not mention other servers just dropping food on our table & not even asking who it belonged to.  The manager is no where to be found and we waited a good 30 minutes just to pay our bill.. this establishment needs much better management because our server should not have been handling 8 tables by herself without any help from someone higher up. Managers didn't even come out to apologize for anything... I will never frequent this establishment again."}
{"text":"First let me just say, the place is beautiful! Now let's get to the point.... The service was AWFUL!!!! Tables was sat, fed and left before we got our food! Then we was given a ridiculous explanation...  It was five of us and I ordered the fat azz chicken sandwich with no sides. That was the excuse they gave us on why it took forever! What a shame for such a nice place.... I wouldn't recommend this place unless you have time to waste and money to burn! P.s you can get better fried chicken from a  your local grocery store!!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I have been to this location multiple times & when it's good it's good but when it's bad it's bad. The service here is usually pretty good. We haven't had too many issues in the customer service department & the last time we had an issue our waiter did adjust the bill for the inconvenience. 

My boyfriend had ordered fried chicken smothered in gravy & when he got his plate the chicken was cold. Not like it's been sitting for too long & cooled down but it was cold, like out of a refrigerator cold. They fixed the issue promptly though. 

I'm giving this place 3 stars for the inconsistency & issues they do have but this place isn't a bad restaurant. The food is typically really good. The fried chicken is crispy, I love their sweet tea & sometimes I order their biscuits to go because I crave them. The biscuits & corn bread are amazing! Besides ordering take out biscuits & cornbread, I may try to sit down here again but I'm one bad experience away from quitting on Lo Lo's all together."}
{"text":"Had the Phat Azz Chicken sandwich!  Threw some syrup on it and it was delicious! 

Didn't think it was possible but the waffle tasted better this time.  I love the waffles."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday afternoon. As expected it was kinda busy, not slammed. We ordered 2 muddy waters which came right away then we preceeded to wait for our food for 45 mins or so. Which is again, to be expected.  We ordered the Malaysia burger, medium well, with jalapeño mayo and an over easy egg. We also ordered the sammich and opted for catfish.
 Let me start by saying our waitress never asked how our food was. Maybe because she knew my burger was cold, with a fried hard egg , and a medium rare cook. I was extremely disappointed. My hubby's fish sammich on the other hand was piping hot, and delicious.  Our server did not ask how our food was, or if we needed anything. We have ordered before and asked for it to go. I think we will stick with that In the future , the employees seemed to be more concerned about the football games than anything else.  I am still giving 3 stars because one bad experience is not enough for me to be too dissapointed."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I love going to the Scottsdale location so of course we had to try the closer location. After a 30 minute wait, we were offered a booth inside but we couldn't make it work with 7 adults and an infant, so we moved to the patio. Although it was 73 degrees outside, it felt hotter in the direct sun. We noticed misters so hopefully those are used soon. They may need to add table cloths since the table tops were very hot to the touch. Also, the patio music was way too loud to have a conversation and they told us the manager didn't allow them to turn down the volume. The service was good and the food was delicious. Aside from the noise and heat on the patio, we had a good lunch."}
{"text":"They even have a sign on the door addressing the YELP complaints ... It's real food that they make and serve, it's made from scratch, to order, it takes time. They just opened and they have had some staff training issues, which they are working on, please bear with them. Our service was excellent, it was timely and we didn't want for anything. The food came within a reasonable time, it was delicious and hot and fresh, and this was on a Saturday morning with almost a full house. Whatever has happend in the past, they seem to be right on top of it and addressing the situation the best they can and it's working. We will certainly be back!!"}
{"text":"I love their chicken and waffles! I really enjoy their fried chicken and the thin waffles. The way they serve their drinks is super cute too, they're served in a mason jar. The service is alright, but I will be coming back for fried chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Server was pleasant. Chicken and waffles are a great combo. The only 1 negative feedback I would have is the time it took to have our meals out, wasn't busy but didn't order anything fancy just Chicken & Waffles and the hold was FRIES (never ordered fries). Don't know if they gave our food away to someone that came after us but it took more than 20 minutes to get it. Overall food is always great!"}
{"text":"If comparing to Scottsdale you need to know there is no comparison!!! So disappointing!!! The chicken we ordered had a different gravy than the Scottsdale one and I explained that I couldn't eat it due to an allergy. The waitress said sorry, and said she would have to charge me to bring me plain chicken. All of the food tasted just alright. In the end we ended up paying 40$ for waffles and Mac and cheese. Server amane sucks. So pushy. Will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Its Wednesday and not the second Sunday after they opened so, this was perfect to stop by and grab a Betty Boob (love the name, catchy). 
Seated quickly as the place wasn't crowded. Just right for a quick 4:30 meal before dinner.
I go to the restroom and as I'm heading back to my table I see my waitress standing there with a smile that greeted me to my hot plate of Betty Boob. I was happy to see my food waiting for me.
The breast was coverd in a crispy coating that complimented the meat well. Waffle was aiight. I don't know if I'll ever get use to the waffle flat jack but, Warm syrup? That's what I'm talking about and the music...Haay!!
On that note, let me two step my thoughts off this app and head home."}
{"text":"Third time I've been to this location. Service was outstanding. The server was so attentive but not annoying. The food. Well, the food is eh. But, there is some hope. I tried two new dishes this time around (both weren't all mine) and they were excellent.

I love hot wings and Chynas hot wings were excellent. Crispy outside, moist inside and the right amount of sauce. Also tried the biscuits and gravy with potatoes. The gravy and biscuits were awesome. Popping with saltiness and a little bit of chive action on top. Potatoes were bland and dry."}
{"text":"Went to the Gilbert location this morning and it was not busy so I thought I hit the jack-pot! Well I was wrong, after taken our seats we waited 17mins for someone to come over to acknowledge us for drinks then we waited 8 additional mins for the to drinks to come and 11mins for the server to come back and take our food order. 

We placed our order and my food arrives first with out the Chicken and my friends food arrived 16mins after mines. 

When we asked the server \"why does the food not come out at the same time\" he responded with \"it does not work like that here\"! Oh...I almost forgot....the Chicken Breast that I ordered did not arrive with my plate but 9mins later and that's only because I had to ask about it. If I had not asked I would have not had it.

This was the worst service I have ever received in a food establishment, the servers seemed lost, and from what I could over hear other tables received the wrong orders. 

I guess if you want all your food to arrive at the same time you will need to call your order in for pick-up then take it home and eat it or get it to go and once you receive it...go find a table and sit done and enjoy. The food was good but I won't be back!"}
{"text":"this is a two star place at best. the service isnt bad at all but the food is very...meh. it was a forgettable experience. the fried chicken was nothing special and the waffles werent very original eithe,r. i can here after i got done getting out of a scuba refresher class, and i always eat out as a way to unwind after diving. this place is a nice bar but not very good for food."}
{"text":"Our party of 8 had a great experience for Saturday brunch. Lorenzo, our waiter, was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday at 10:30 and we were gone by 11:15. Fast service and our waitress DebraLee was super nice, courteous and never forgot about us. The food portions were big but the food is average. I got the Yo Momma's and my son had the Oreo pancakes. He said they were \"meh\" and he also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes-which came with peppers(which he didn't care for).  The prices are decent but the food was average. Bonus points for having Kool aid!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out the Gilbert location because I live in the East Valley. Despite all the negative reviews, we decided to go on a Friday night. The other reviews are accurate. Food not nearly as good as the other locations and it took FOREVER to get it. The only thing that makes this a 2 star and not a 1 star was that the server seemed like she was trying."}
{"text":"2 stars because I love the food, but was here on Sunday morning and told told a 20 minute wait. 20 Minutes later I am told no idea when we will be seated as they ran out of silverware. Really?"}
{"text":"This is the worst soul food place ever I will never return here everything is disgusting but the customer service is great .. they have a lot of work to do"}
{"text":"Boy, that's some mighty fine Chicken and Waffles!

Tonight's the second night they've been open and the service was great. They're incredibly busy, but wait time was very reasonable for service. If you're going in the near future, get there as early as possible. The menu is limited and there are no To Go orders until the kitchen gets up to speed. That's a good idea since they're so busy. 

They claim to have Chicken and Waffles in the Top 5 in the country and I don't doubt it one bit. The KK's platter is three pieces of chicken, two waffles, two eggs, and grits for $15. That's a lot of food. The chicken was perfectly cooked and among the best we've ever had. The waffles were the same level of goodness. There's something about their waffles and syrup that's just \"it\"...some sort of perfect combo. 

The Shrimp and Mac and Cheese was top notch, as well. The mac part is super cheesy and perfectly creamy. The shrimp? Yup, just as good. 

My Shrimp and Grits were good, but completely overshadowed by the chicken. The grits are unseasoned which is great for breakfast (fix 'em up yourself!), but for a savory dish, should support the main item better than these did. It's still good, but I'd go for KK' s over this. 

Overall, it was a great meal and the service was very good. You can tell they're just getting their \"sea legs\", but we had fantastic service even for an established restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was great. The service was even better. And the playlist of music was banging!!! Such a great friendly environment"}
{"text":"Eat here yesterday for lunch. Luckily there was no wait and we were seated right away. The hosts were very friendly and I liked our waiter. This place is supposed to be the roscoes of vegas. I ordered the chicken and waffles, my friend had the same. I loved the chicken! The waffles however need some work they were very bland. They've only been open for a couple weeks so they have time to get the waffles together. Overall I really liked this spot I'll definitely be back with my friends!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. I'm originally from Cali so Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles is near and dear to my heart. Lo-Lo's fills the place in my soul that's missing now that I'm in the desert. Great and friendly servers, food comes out fast and is fantastic quality. 

Can't go wrong with a Lil' Amadi with a Thigh and Drumstick. Add a piece of catfish on the side and some iced tea in a mason jar to drink. Perfect. 

Lo-Lo's in Gilbert is always on the menu for us!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars... The food is not very good and takes FOREVER to come out. My daughter got a job here when they first opened. The management is HORRIBLE. She was harassed and after a short time quit. The management is even rude to the customers. I really don't like having an establishment with this type of reputation in my downtown. I live in this area and it's really a black eye on the Heritage District. I hope they don't last."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the very first time today and was very pleased with the experience. Upon walking in, one of the waiters greeted us with fist bumps and pulled out the table so my fiancé (on crutches) could slide into the booth side easier. What I loved is the waiters/waitresses talk to you like old friends and they are having a great time. We both had yo momma's biscuits n gravy and shared the stupid fries. Both dishes were amazing and tastey! The portions are big so come with an empty stomach but if you can't finish, no worries, you can take the rest home with you. We'll definitely be back. I want to try the Purplesaurus Rex. Jazmine was our waitress, so shout out to her and the whole staff really as everyone is friendly!"}
{"text":"GREAT!!   We ordered one fried chicken sandwich and one grilled chicken Mediterranean type salad.   Both were huge portions and very good. We will absolutely go there again."}
{"text":"If you are ever craving chicken and waffles, this place will satisfy you, but will leave you thinking you could have made this yourself. 

The menu is pretty self-explanatory, it mostly serves different chicken and waffle options along with certain comfort-food sides that are very familiar to the general public. 

We chose the dark meat chicken and waffles option, I forgot what it was called. The fried chicken was good, not the best I've had, but still good! You can get the same quality of fried chicken though at somewhere like Church's chicken or Bush's Chicken in my opinion. The waffle was also very plain, something that can be easily made at home. 

The sides were very plain too. We got the Mac n cheese and the grits! The Mac n cheese tasted like it came from a cafeteria. Definitely NOT like the Mac n cheese you can get at Joe's Real BBQ right across the street! The grits were SOOO BLAND!!!! DO NOT get the grits! 

So overall, the food was alright but it kinda reminded me of food you would get at a place like IHOP or the Waffle House really late at night mostly because it's the only place that's opened. I wouldn't actually come here when I know there are other places that are WAY better than this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food with Charon!!!!  I just wonder how anyone can come here and order anything but Chicken and Waffles. I will be back for another LoLo's #3."}
{"text":"We go super early to avoid waiting and the service is a little slow but food is good enough and the location is fun."}
{"text":"I've dined in once and take out once.  I really like the catfish and chicken entrees.  The piece of catfish was huge as was the chicken thigh.  Some of the sides I favor are:  cornbread muffin, squash medley and red beans & rice.  I did not like the dirty rice and the waitress was very obliging about bringing me a different side.  The sweet tea is good too; not too sweet the way I like it.  I like it and will probably come back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate dinner at the Lo Lo's in Gilbert tonight. Neither one of us had been to this location before and we were very impressed with our experience. We were seated quickly and our waiter Roman immediately was at our table to greet us. He was attentive, kind and efficient. Our drinks and food order was placed quickly and he made sure to constantly check up on us throughout our meal. I was thoroughly impressed with Roman and my fiancé and I agree that it is probably some of the best service we have received at any restaurant. We would absolutely eat here again."}
{"text":"The only reason this isn't a two star review is the banana pudding, which I would donate a kidney for, it was that good. Ordered to-go, the chicken was overcooked, the fried green tomatoes were good but there were NO condiments, no \"famous\" dipping sauce for the tomatoes, no butter, no SYRUP for the chicken and waffles. Nothing to combat the dry stringiness of overcooked chicken. I finished about half of it before guiltily throwing it away. 
But the banana pudding? I could happily eat it every day for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"I have to come back and give a more detailed review but I legit loved the biscuit and my cherry martini but we had some problems with our chicken but the service was actually really good and I plan to come and check it out again if you're a fan of southern type food like biscuits and gravy give this place a try!! They even have kool aid and adorable cups"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles has created quite the Bzzzz around town....

I was able to score a table during lunch after my second attempt this past weekend and I'm extremely impressed with the ambiance. Lo-Lo's dining room is very trendy loved the decor.

The food is extremely debatable and after reading tons of reviews I'm confident with my overall three star rating. 

WHAT I ORDERED:

KK's Fried Chicken & Waffles
*Chicken was phenomenal! The seasoning was perfect and the portion size exceeded my expectations MUST TRY ITEM. The waffles were over powered by cinnamon but decent.

*Catfish Add-On was pretty disappointing considering how well seasoned the chicken was.

*Okra was decent but pretty warm by the time my food arrived.

*The Red Beans?? Yikes!!! By far the worst item ordered. The beans taste like BBQ sauce and chili powder. Definitely needs some improvement.

*Peach Cobbler! I can't believe they served this with massive dough chunks. Terrible!!!!

*Round of applause for my BANANA PUDDING! I looked forward to this dessert and it did not disappoint! If your a fan this is a must order dessert!

I don't think I'd return but it was definitely worth the experience and I sincerely hope the restaurant considers improving some of their menu items. 

Thank you Ms. Nykeia for being patient with me and my mother and providing exceptional service during such a busy time."}
{"text":"Food is good went to the Arizona location many of times 

Sucks at this location they don't take call in orders 

And also when u come inside to make a take out order you have to pack the food yourself ?!?!?

Don't understand why they can't just put the food in the box for you ??? 

If someone could answer that I would appreciate it"}
{"text":"It seems like this one is a hit or miss. It was a hit when we went! There was 4 of us and everything we ordered came out delicious except the home fries. I would skip those. They were dry and not very appealing. The dranks we ordered with alcohol were nice and strong just like we like it. The kool-aid is super sweet. Like way too sweet but maybe that's how some people like their kool-aid to be. I loved the catfish and their special tabasco like sauce they have sitting on the table. Over all we loved it! The prices are good too for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"I really like LoLo's, I can't understand why the average review is only 3 stars for this restaurant. Then again, I am not a soul food expert. However, I have always enjoyed their fried chicken, waffles, fried green tomatoes, collard greens, and fried okra. OK, anything fried is great here!! Don't forget the banana pudding.

Been meaning to try it out for breakfast. This can be a great alternative in downtown Gilbert when some of the other trendy restaurants have long lines.

You could easily ingest 3 days worth of calories in one meal at LoLo's but that is the point right?"}
{"text":"Double check your bank account when your transaction clears the bank!  Server took it upon himself to add tip.  

Two issues with this Gilbert location:  

The main issue I have with this place is that their server added an undeserving and unauthorized tip to my check.  No response from their corporate office when I submitted my complaint and requested a copy of the receipt that was used to reconcile the tip.  After speaking with the manager, all he could come up with was... well I can get your tip refunded back to you.... really? After a miserably long dinner duration, compounded with waiting an additional 30 minutes just for the check (other tables around us simply left without paying) and he thinks my concern is the tip....  how about forgery, theft, fraud?

Based on all the other reviews - no surprise... this place is slow.....  Don't count on getting everything you ordered, and really don't expect anything else outside of what the food runner initially drops off. No refills, No ketchup, No missing tableware, No napkins, ....think you got the picture..."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow. Food was descent.  I think the best part was the greens. Ordered chicken fried steak, collard  greens and  home potatoes.  I would come back for another try"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and they had a 20 minute wait. Cool, no problem, we're ready to wait for some awesome chicken and waffles! We were sat and gave our order to our server Chevy, she was very nice and friendly. Waiting about 20 minutes, still no drinks. Our server comes and says it'll be another 15-20 mins for food, we say it's fine but can we at least have our drinks lol we watched a couple of tables get their food at about 10-15 mins after their order, so we think our server forgot. A food runner comes to our table and brings food we didn't order, it was for the next table. At this point we just think it's really funny no one seems to know what they're doing. Of course they've been opened for only a week so we just laugh it off. About 10 minutes go by and our server comes again saying everything's coming should be just a few more minutes. Finally maybe after 50 minutes we get our food. We ordered 3 plates of chicken and waffles, cornbread, mac and cheese, pineapple upside down pancakes, and the corn fritters. We got everything together except the corn fritters. We asked the server and she said they should be coming, she forgot again lol those were supposed to be starters but it came last, when we were almost done. The chicken is delicious! Throw some hot sauce and honey on it and you're good to go! Oh yeah the server only wanted to give us one side of honey? We asked if we have to pay for another side and she didn't seem to know so we just settled for the one side she gave us lol anyway, the waffle I didn't like so much, as other reviews say, it's quite soggy. It really is more like a pancake. It's weird how soggy it was. Mac and cheese was ok. The corn bread was a bit hard but the inside was ok. The pineapple upside down pancake wasn't worth the $13. The corn fritters were great! Crunchy and creamy and sweet and spicy all in one bite! I would come back to have some chicken and those corn fritters! I'm hoping their service will get better, they were friendly, just forgetful and confused lol"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed.  I ordered the #3 regular chicken and waffles.  The fried chicken was nothing special (similar to grocery store deli fried chicken); the waffles were ok, too much cinnamon or nutmeg.  POSITIVE: waitress was good & the NO WAIT app worked like a charm.  Might come back to try something different.  Might not."}
{"text":"We went Lo-Lo's in Las Vegas and had an absolute terrible experience. My family and I entered the restaurant at the same exact time as a group of 4 guys. Both groups were seated.  We waited about 25 minutes and nobody stopped by to check on us, talk to us, take our orders, absolutely nothing. The bar had 1 person sitting there and the restaurant was half empty, not busy at all. The staff just continued to walk by and ignore my family.  I told my wife we should go, but she insisted we wait. 10 more minutes passed. She flagged down a waiter and he greeted us, but didn't take our order. My son was hungry started to become irritated, but still decided to wait another 15 minutes and was still ignored. We saw the group of guys that entered the restaurant along with us get served 4 plates of food and yet we haven't even been approached to put in an order. We were disgusted and with our son hungry and decided at that point it was time for us to leave. We wasted and waited 50 minutes to order food. Never in life, have I experienced such a poor customer service. This place lacks any type of consistency. The menu online states drinks are $6, but when you get to the restaurant they are quick to charge you $8!"}
{"text":"I have been to the other locations and my favorite is Scottsdale.  I probably will not go back to the Gilbert location.  I was happy to find one closer but the flavor of food from Scottsdale location is 100% better.  The peach cobbler had no taste!  Really messing up on peach cobbler is a crime.  Banana pudding was ok.  The greens were not as good as Scottsdale.  Maybe they need to train more with Scottsdale cooks.  The wait was long and getting the food took a long time too.  Our server (Kyle) was the best part.  Also the lights were bright as heck!  Also, it was expensive as heck.  Maybe I need a Groupon. I loved the music.  Stop trying to appeal to the city of Gilbert and get back to the basics that made people drive an hour to get good soul food."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness...fried green tomatoes...yummy. And chicken and waffles...outstanding!!!  Even though I have a hard time with the 2 in one meal. This food was delicious and the entire team of coworkers were very sweet and courteous to us. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This place has become a new Vegas must-go-to place while we are in town. Absolutely delicious. The chicken was perfectly crisp and the waffles were just the right amount of sweet.  I ordered \"Betty's Boob\" and my husband had \"DD\".  The iced  t was so sweet I think I left with diabetes, but it was good!"}
{"text":"Went to the Scottsdale location until I moved to Gilbert. Have been to this location a few times and the food has always been good. Biscuits & gravy and 'Uncle Brothas' shrimp & grits are my personal favorites. Chicken and waffles are good stuff too. Only gripe is that the service could be better and the wait times are long if you don't come at the right time. The wait is worth it though."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Had the  Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles one day and the omelette the next. 

The chicken and waffles are a great choice but I think they should use a more thick and crispy waffle. 

Would dine here again."}
{"text":"Go when Sparky is serving. He is the best ! Every time I have been there he has made sure our food was hot and that we had a good time."}
{"text":"Took about 30 minutes to get our food when it wasn't so busy. When we asked the waitress for extra sauce and to fill our drinks, she looked annoyed. Other than that, it had some pretty good wings!"}
{"text":"Wow, so disappointed I read the reviews first but I didn't want to judge until I tried them for myself, the food was soooo bad! Wow I ordered the shrimp and grits, it was expensive and tasted so bad I didn't even finish it! The waitress brought the check and gave it to us without asking us if we wanted to order something else (we were thinking about dessert) everyone there looks like they don't know what they're doing, and I know they just opened recently but this is a franchise that's been out there for a while they should have trained their employees well, our bill was $40 we were only 2 people and we didn't order much, probably won't ever go there again, not to mention my stomach started hurting right after we left the place. I'm sorry but major improvement is highly needed!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is fine but doesn't excite me. I feel like I can get a better waffle at Waffle House, and better fried chicken at Popeye's. If you want them both at the same stop though, this is the only game in town. The drinks are insanely sugary and even though we were offered refills they weren't needed since I had to dilute my sweet tea into my water cup and got four 'jugs' of sweet tea out of one actual serving."}
{"text":"Me, my friends, and my family (a party of 16) visited this location on Sat. for my birthday.  I've been to this Lolo's, and the one in Scottsdale previously, so I was confident this would be a great place for everyone to enjoy.

We called ahead and let them know we had a large party coming.  They don't take reservations, but just a few minutes after they arrived they'd made a large section for our group on the patio, so we could all sit together.  The weather was perfect for us to all sit outside and relax.

Our server, Andrea, arrived promptly to take our drink orders.  She was very friendly, and anticipated we'd need a lot of seperate checks.  We were very happy we didn't have to ask for seperate checks, since there were so many of us.  But she rocked it, and was totally prepared.  All the drinks came out quickly & correctly.

The food, to everyone's surpise and delight, came out not long after the drinks.  For a party of 16 people, you expect there to be a few errors here and there.  There was only 1 small one, my husband's meal came with 1 chicken breast, instead of 2, which Andrea recognized, and got corrected in just a moment.  His plate was back with the other piece of chicken by the time the rest of the food was served.

I got 2 drumsticks, a waffle, and a side of mac 'n' cheese.  Their fried chicken is perfect.  It's crisp & not oily on the outside, and juicy and tender on the inside.  Everyone absolutely loved their chicken.  The waffles are fantastic.  I always eat the whole thing, and I usually hate waffles.  Lolo's is the only place I will eat one, and love every bite.  The mac 'n' cheese was great too, no complaints, super yummy.  Several of my friends got their \"Big Azz Sandwich\", and went nuts for them.

Everyone in our group loved their meal.  There wasn't a single complaint, except about how we could not eat another bite.  The only thing that I think was better than the food, was the service.  Not only was it well above average for what you expect dining out, but is was beyond our expectations for a party that large.  Every single person there commented on how great it was.  We will all definitely be back."}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits were awesome with so much flavor! Wine $2 off for happy hour. Our sever E.J. was the best server we have had in months and months. This guy knows how to treat people! We will be back especially because of the amazing service that was provided! And the food was a bonus!!!!!"}
{"text":"Damn good chicken and waffles!! I sat at the bar. The bartender was bubbly and friendly. I already knew what I wanted and it came out in 5 mins! Hot and fresh and seriously delicious! The chicken breast is juicy! The waffles were the perfect crunch on the edges! Great find for casual dining!

Update: My first visit was on a Wednesday around 2pm. I guess I just got lucky that day. I raved about this place to My fiancé and I made him come on a Saturday night. Bad idea it was swamped. We sat at the bar for 20 mins and we were not even offered water until we asked for it and menus. We finally got up and left! Too bad it's not consistent service wise."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had.

The bartender, that couldn't serve drinks by the way because they didn't have their liquor license yet, did nothing but disappear and flirt with these 2 girls the entire time.

After we sat down, we were ignored for about 10 minutes. The bar was sticky with syrup residue and previous customer's dishes. The menus were falling apart and there was over an hour wait time. He then took our order. The food arrived in a decent amount of time and wasn't too bad. A little on the pricey side for certain things, but not terrible. The waiter that brought us the food had to go and get silverware and our drinks because the bartender who took our order never brought us those items. There was no syrup for the waffles and after asking the bartender for syrup twice, we finally walked over to another area of the bar and asked the girls if they were done with the syrup and could we have it. A few minutes later, the bartender came back and brought the girls, who were completely done eating, 2 bottles of syrup. He still, did not engage us. 

When the girls left, he left the bar and ran outside of the restaurant and talked to the girls for a few more minutes outside before coming back in the restaurant. 

We weren't the only ones who received this crappy of service. I watched patron after patron trying to get the attention of their server and being ignored.

If the staff was focused more on their customers instead of flirting or just standing around, they would have more happy customers. Plus, I watched a few servers improperly disposed of food which is a health code violation.

I will never go back."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service. Our server literally forgot she had our table. She brought us drinks and then ignored us for 15 minutes. The place wasn't busy at all (2pm on a Tuesday). Ridiculous. My father finally approached her as she was chatting casually with the bartender, and she was very apologetic. It was a crap situation, but we appreciated that she owned up to her mistake.

We asked her for the check for our drinks because we were tired of waiting waiting waiting. She assured us she would rush our food through the kitchen.  While our food DID come out within 15 mintues, it was NOT good. My salad was missing some ingredients and my father's chicken was very dry and bland.  

It was disappointing that the manager never even stopped by to ask us about our dining experience. I don't dine-out prowling for freebies, but it would have been nice to discount our check or offer a complimentary dessert. This place needs to get its act together."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I wanted to have some breakfast, and were looking for places nearby and came across Lo Lo's chicken and waffles. To me, that always sounds delicious so it was a win. Probably one of the best orders of chicken and waffles I have had. Service was great and we got our food pretty quickly. The vibe was great, music was poppin, and the staff was very attentive. A little pricey, but worth every bite. We will be making more appearances at this place."}
{"text":"It's a lil busy due to just opening at this location but other wise very delicious .."}
{"text":"Great food, and great customer service(Lorenzo)
This location however has horrible waiting times and not enough shading and definitely needs a cooling system"}
{"text":"So I am not sure what was more pleasing the service or the food. We had a server named ( Sparky ) who gave us what has to be the absolute best service that I have received in a very long time. I enjoyed it so much on my first visit , that I had to bring my mom who is the real food critic on my second visit . The food was absolutely delicious and the service was even better please keep up the good work !!"}
{"text":"Call ahead and get on the waiting list.  I would go here more often , If i knew I didn't have to call ahead all the time. Once you get seated it will take about a hour and half from order to finishing. Food takes a really long time to come out. 

The food is 5 stars and service depending on who you get is 3 to 5 stars. Call ahead for a table and make sure to know have a time sensitive meal here."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  simply put...I'm originally from L.A. and I have been to Roscoes chicken and waffles and for me...hands downs LO-LOz kicks thier azz...Fo sure
But here is draw back...be ready to wait to be seated 
As we sat down at bar because there was a long azz wait to be seated.  We noticed alot of empty booths???  The lady that sat besides me (she said that she has eaten at the original one from Arizona and says this as good as that one) she said the same thing(I'll get back to this at the end)...so the bartender asks us what we would like so we start off??? We started off with coffee...I must say the coffee is great and the Size if the cup was awesome  as we look over our menu...it's breakfast but dying to come back for dinner already with all this menu items that I have to try...but we order jalapeño sliders and #1 which consists of....Chicken and waffles...what did u think I was gunna say???  Lol
Anyways there was sooooooooooo many choices to pick from but this is our first time sooooooooooo OG is what we are here for...the sliders came up (it took a bit being an appetizer) and as Smoky from Friday would put it....DAMNNNNNNNN!!!!!  (the only thing missing was the cheese) then the OG platter comes up right after....the Chicken AWESOME the Waffles AWESOME the grits AWESOME and eggs and cheese AWESOME the onions on top of eggs not so awesome at least for me....whoops forgot the gravy AWESOME with tableside hot sauce fucking AWESOME!!!
The service was friendly and on point...now the bartender ask is everything?  My response Hell Yeah!!! I tell him can't wait to come back...the only question on my mind is.... The long wait and empty booths?  So ask him what's up with that...his response is great and understandable...when they first opened they locked and overloaded up thier small kitchen...its big restaurant with a small kitchen...so in closing great addition to Las Vegas breakfast line...one more thing for management...it's Sunday...get up from back table leave your computer and paperwork for later that day and walk and greet your customers...the lady that sat next to me that I  didn't know thought the same Thang...get ur arms a little dirty and watch ur customers appreciate that...."}
{"text":"My sister and I came her for lunch and were so excited to try it since neither one of us have ever been to a Lo-lo's chicken and waffles before.  Surprisingly we were disappointed!! The food was mediocre and overpriced!! The portions are gigantic and can definitely be shared!! Our waitress was nothing special and seemed out of it the entire time!!  I don't plan on coming back to this location."}
{"text":"We went to Lo-Lo's last week for my birthday, with my kids and grandkids.  What a great place to go!  We have such a great time, and the food was amazing!  Our server, Lorenzo, made the experience, that much more fun.  He was very full of life, and the kids loved the whole experience.  We will definitely be going back there for some great food and an amazing time!
The kids loved the Kool-Aid drinks the best!  They were amazed!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places when it cones to chicken and waffles but haven't been back since the opening .Once you get your food tho you will understand why they are so popular ..have to have some patience tho it can be slow at times"}
{"text":"My husband loves chicken wings so we decided to try Lolos. We went on a Sunday afternoon and they were packed, we had about a 20 minute wait. I am not a huge fried chicken fan but decided to try the chicken wings and waffle. I absolutely loved them, the chicken wings were delicious, seasoned well and cooked perfectly, the waffle was good also (and yes, they are as good as Roscoes). My husband, the wing aficionado, loved the wings. I also had a side of cheese grits, they were loaded with cheese, but good. Topped it off with homemade lemonade and sweet tea made just how we like it. For dessert we shared peach cobbler, we didn't care for the peach cobbler, the \"crust\" was more like bread with an odd taste, and a corner of it was cold.

Service was good, our waitress was on point with all our requests. With that said, we will be back!

Well I have been back a few times and I have been disappointed each time. The grits.... Are bland and sticky and just not good anymore, I stopped ordering them. The waffles have not been the same either the last time I had them they tasted like a cup of cinnamon was mixed in the batter. Good thing the wings have been tasty, but Lolos is just not my first choice anymore. Also, the last time we were there it took about 30 minutes to receive our food. Food and service is not consistent, back to Roscoes I go!"}
{"text":"Maybe the last visit was a fluke.  This time the chicken was huge and juicy.  The veggies were wonderful.  Thx for bringing fantastic back lo Los."}
{"text":"Great food and people. We always stop when we are passing through. The chicken has great taste and don't forget to get a t-shirt on the way out."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that mine and my husbands meal was perfect. I got the shrimp mac and cheese...so yummy. The blue Kool aid took me back to my childhood days. The waitress was very nice but there was a server there named morgan who was very rude. Needs a total attitude adjustment. I had a fork dropped me and I got offered a free desert which was nice but decided to pass.  I will be back again but probably just get my food to go."}
{"text":"Saturday morning so lots of traffic. Walked the street scoping out different options. Chicken and waffles sounded good. The greeting was a little confusing. With no signs we seated outside. Someone came over to inform us we had to check in. Service was friendly and courteous. Chicken was good not great. Waffle was not that impressive. Kind of gooey. Will try another option next time."}
{"text":"I've been to Lo-Lo's a few times and I've had good service each time. I have heard horror stories though. Thankfully, I don't have any of my own. That being said, let's discuss the food and service. 

Each time, each waiter/waitress has been attentive, kind and sometimes friendly. I have yet to have the same waiter/waitress though I have seen them all each visit. I have been ONE time when it was busy and I learned then, never again. Not because service was bad, but because I was hungry and their seating procedures seemed to be unorganized at the time. 

Food! I enjoyed my food at Lo-Lo's. My favorite are the fried green tomatoes. This last visit, I went against my norm and ordered Uncle Brotha's Shrimp and Grits. I'll make this short. I won't order it again. The grits weren't seasoned and the tails were still on the shrimp. I requested them to be taken off but the kitchen decided against my request. WHY OH WHY keep the tails on is a MYSTERY to me. Yet so many restaurants do it. Dumb kitchen policy!! DUMB!

When my food came, I had to wait until it cooled a little so I could remove the tails. UGH! So bothersome to go through all that work and then have under-seasoned food. I was upset! I sprinkled black pepper on the plate, cut the shrimp and then remixed everything. I'm guessing the grits aren't seasoned because the shrimp is heavily seasoned and the cheese brings a level of salt on its own. Once I created a new dish in front of my own eyes, I ate every bite. That bowl was almost dish-washing clean when I was done. It wasn't that the new version of my meal was delicious. It was that I was almost in starvation mode. After creating a new mix, the dish itself was decent. 

I will return to Lo-Lo's as it's been added to my \"must-eat-here\" list in Vegas. I just won't order Uncle Brotha's Shrimp and Grits again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Not really good soul food. I felt the food was very bland and the Chicken was extremely salty.  I ordered the #14 w/ chicken"}
{"text":"First time been here food is good but service so horrible, server Jazmine didn't even check if we need anything after we got our food. Didn't get no refill on our drinks and after seating there half an hour we have to asked for our checks. She sucks."}
{"text":"Sad experience today, Lo-Los's is no longer our favorite.  Had bad service and not great food. My husband and I ordered the same thing (chicken sandwich) and they looked totally different.  A friend's chicen was dry. The waitress seemed like she would have rather been anywhere but there. 

We wondered how a restaurant in Gilbert had immediate seating... guess now we know."}
{"text":"Table for two. We waited for 60min and never got our food. We ended up leaving and going to the drive through at Sonic Burger down the road.  Wait a few weeks and let them iron out a few wrinkles. They've \"only got one egg guy...\""}
{"text":"This place should be called Jo-Ko's because this place is a joke!! The chicken was cooked in burnt grease, still pink inside, the spinach was salty and the Mac and cheese was a mixture of velveeta and kraft singles mixed together and don't get me started on the server that was legit checked out. This place seemed as if it was going to be great but once we actually tasted the food it was a huge let down."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place. I went on the same day they opened and waited 25 minutes. Wasn't that bad of a wait because I thought the food was worth it. I ordered a Breast n a Wing with 1 waffle. Also sweet tea and a fruit Punch Kool aid. At first the waffle was very thin but it tasted decent and we also ordered Mac n cheese and it was smallest side dish I've ever gotten at a restaurant. And it was $4. Definitely wasn't worth the sides and i think it was a rip off or they had made a mistake. Two bites and gone, just like that. My wife was very disappointed. But the chicken was on point. Prolly the best chicken I've ever tested at soul food place! Atmosphere n service was ok. Heard servers n hosts were arguing few times and dropping dishes also. I think this place has potential. Very good location and the food was good! Staff definitely needs to be train a lil bit more and plz cmon make the sides a little bigger! Don't give us $1 worth of sides when y'all charging us $4-7 for a side! 3 stars is deserving!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Everything else from the minute I walked in to put my name on the list was not.

Wait time to be seated was twice what we were told. I get we came on a busy day but then why low-ball it that much?

Time to get our food was also crazy, about 30 minutes for our appetizer and then another 15 for the three chicken and waffle orders. The kitchen seemed backed up, but again, why not just say something?

That was the worst part of the whole experience. Our server barely acknowledged us. We wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that mate he was just busy, but we realized we never even saw him on the floor. He wasn't running food, or checking other tables. He was in the kitchen for 15-20 min at a time. At one point I saw him leaning against the server stand talking to someone, and I waved him down because we needed refills. Instead of coming to us, he ducked back in the kitchen, then came out a few minutes later and just said \"your food is coming, guys then tried to leave again before we could even ask for refills. And up to the point, we had never even mentioned the time. We couldn't have, because he had been in the kitchen for 15 min!

Also, one of the plates we were given had a crack in  it, and both the men's and women's restrooms were out of soap for the entire hour and a half we were there, even after telling one of the employees in the first 20 min. Hopefully none of the employees were using the bathroom during that time."}
{"text":"We were looking for something before we headed back to LA.  This place was close.  We called ahead to  place our order, but still had to wait another 30 min after we arrived.  Food was average."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Went here with friends around 3pm, got seated in 10 minutes or so. Food took more than 45 minutes to come out. Chicken was disgusting and dry and the waffle was worst than an Eggo waffle I could make with my toaster. Syrup tasted questionable and even their water seemed like it was from the canal right next door. The lemonade was too sweet, too much sugar, tasted like future diabetes. Not only was the food bad, but also the service. No one checked on us at all, not once during our whole 2 hours there. Took about 30 minutes to even get the bill and an additional 30 minutes to even get our credit cards back. Terrible food, terrible service. Negative 5 stars if I could, will never be returning."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  Waited over an hour for some over priced waffles.  So disorganized, rude staff."}
{"text":"This is a nice looking Lo-Lo's with a cool patio space and open floor model interior. There are very few private corner areas so I don't recommend this place for intimacy like the Scottsdale Lo-Lo's can kind of provide.

I'm very hands-on about the kind of service I receive, I don't just go the easy way, play it safe, hush up or stay complacent. There was a line at the host post with no one there so my friend and I sat at the bar to be served quickly. There's very little seating waiting space and I can't stand in one place that long, as well as many other people, so I disapprove of that aspect...

It took at least 15 min to be spoken to by a staff member. No one was tending the bar. We didn't have water either until the waitress come over, no straws though, 10 min later... The waitress went over to my *male* friend on the outside of the bar to stand at his side and take his order. I can't hear a thing because the music is blasting and I think we were by speakers. I yelped out \"why don't you come over here?\" and motioned around to me. The waitress just shouted over my friend, leaned in a bit and stood there. I was already very uncomfortably turning my body around so you'd think anyone with sense or eyes would see that and correct it for you to be comfortable. I'm starting to lose my faith in the service industry, anyways...

I asked her if the chef could prepare an entree without certain ingredients, and finally if you can take eggs out of the chorizo and she said, \"I don't know\" and just stared at me, \"well, can you ask\", I inquired, again, there's a pause, and she says, \"you... you want me to ask?\" very slowly... Like it's inconvenient? It's your job. I'll go back there and ask him I don't care, but I don't think it's allowed. So, yes, duh. She goes. It's another 15 minutes. My friend turns to me and says, \"I wonder if that's what you're getting now.\" 5 minutes later she comes back and says the chef says \"it will taste nasty if you took out eggs\". Excuse me? I have always wanted to try their chorizo but I h a t e eggs. I find plain chorizo like from the grocery store that I make *delicious* though! I don't see a reason to add eggs to well-seasoned meat in the first place. I didn't get it but I have a suspicious feeing it would taste fine. Although the waitress said it's basically all eggs and no meat so it's not a good money's worth...well that's stupid.

So we both ordered chicken dishes, 10 min later it's out, tastes great, just fine there. I read that Lo-Lo's had free sides with the Hood Classics during the month of July but my friend did not receive an extra side or comped side with his Hood Classic dish. Which was the whole point we went but I was so hungry and frustrated I forgot to point it out since we had been there sooo long as it is! The chicken is ok but it has that rubber stiff tendon skin texture (or bone pieces?) sometimes that you see with more \"natural\" chicken that I don't like and the waffles can be sickeningly sweet especially with syrup. It's certainty not good enough to ignore all their failures as a whole chain (see my Phoenix Lo-Lo's) review."}
{"text":"First time here. We had a party of 6 and ended up waiting 45 minutes for our food to come out. Our waitress was great and kept checking in on us. She provided some cornbread and refilled a couple of drinks we had that were not normally refillable. When the food finally came out it look great I had chicken and waffles with side of grits and a scrambled egg with cheese and onion. The chicken was the best xhocken I had tasted in Vegas and the waffle was cooked perfectly. The eggs were food but I didnt get to eat the grits because I was full off the other stuff. Without the long wait Inwould have given it 4 stars but the manager did comp part of our bill because of the wait. I will be back again because of the great staff."}
{"text":"Lo Lo's must be short for Low Inventory and Low Concern for Customer Satisfaction. I was severely disappointed. I spotted this place on a previous visit to Vegas. Despite mixed yelp reviews I had my sights set on patronizing this business on my next trip. We went on a Monday night. The hostess was friendly asked if we wanted waters but said she'd send the server over. No water.  The menu was expansive with many amusing entree names so it took a while to decide what we wanted but when we finally did we waited only for the server to come back and say they were out of several of the items and then came back and said they were out of an additional item.  It was most annoying and a server should already know what's out before they take your order. What's most irritating is that even though we shared it was our first time there and that we have been looking forward to coming they were so unapologetic about being out of items.  The manager never came over and they didn't offer any compensation. Since they kept coming back to food came out separately instead of at the same time. Just really trifling over all. They don't have to worry about me coming back."}
{"text":"Seated promptly, but took awhile for them to take our order the hostess apologized for it and comped our beverages 
Service is slow
Smothered potatoes was no Bueno 
Chicken was dry and flavorless
Waffles were cold,  and tasted store bought instead of home made
Kool aid made my sister throat itch,  she said it tasted like \"dollar store jug of punch\" lol... 
Fried green tomatoes really didn't taste like anything 
I'm kinda upset over this experience, because I want the business to succeed..."}
{"text":"Horrible Customer Service Waitress Ask For A Tip Came Out Side Mad Because We Didn't Leave A Tip Like How She Didn't Know If It Was Our Last Money"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch around 2 pm with a few girlfriends after hearing great reviews on social media, i will say i was initially impressed by the size of the restaurant and the fact that there was no wait when we arrived, once we were seated and placed our drink orders i knew that the service was going to be a problem , two our of four of us had to wait at least 20 minutes for water and then an additional 15 minutes for our cocktails , unfortunately the melon mojiot we received were extremely underwhelming, they basically gave us watered down Sierra Mist with limp mint and lime, from then on the service continued to go down hill ,but anyways lets move on to the shining star of our meal... the chicken!!! Perfect texture crunch and flavor ! Will definitely go back for the chicken,also my friends ordered the Mac and cheese and complained that it tasted identical to velveeta mac and cheese, all in all the food was good but not great , i would say for the most part they have phenomenal drinks but the overall service is rather poor,"}
{"text":"Food was fresh & so good. Not to mention the yummy watermelon kool-aid. Good vibe when you walk in. I was greeted with a smile & even the waitress & another waitress was so nice, friendly, upbeat and accommodating. Keep it up, I will be back most definitely & I will bring others."}
{"text":"Absolutely, positively, unequivocally AMAZING!!!! Came here while vacationing in AZ. My stomach and I am so glad we stopped here."}
{"text":"Very flavorful. Try the Phat Azz Sandwich. It...Is...Phaat!"}
{"text":"I am use to dining at Lo Los in Scottsdale-Phoenix, AZ when I resided out there and was very excited to hear they were opening here in Las Vegas. I wend during the first week of opening and it was very busy. Wait times exceeded 2 hours for a booth but seated immediately for the bar. Food was mediocre and there was a limited menu due to a 'soft open' which disappointed me since I have a favorite meal I typically get that was not available. Once I ordered, my friend and I's food took over 45 minutes to come as well as when we were finished we sat for an additional 45 minutes waiting to get the check. I would give this place another go since I did go the first week but first impression was meh."}
{"text":"This is the newest installment in the franchises (others located in Scottsdale and Phoenix) and it is a nice looking location. The staff is wonderful, entertaining and friendly :)"}
{"text":"I was in town from Texas visiting. My friend asked me to pick a restaurant to eat in the Gilbert area. This place caught my eye. The last time that I had chicken and waffles was years ago on Beale Street in Memphis. That wonderful experience has remained in my brain. The chicken was hot, crispy and moist inside. The waffles were thick enough to hold the syrup, crunchy on outside and soft in middle. THIS WAS NOT THE SAME!  The chicken was almost cold and soggy like they were reheated in the microwave. I ordered the signature dish; \"Lo lo's\" with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. When it came out I asked where was the 3rd piece. Turned out the drumstick was hidden by the wing!  The waffles were thin and soggy. I must say the wait staff was friendly and helpful but the kitchen staff needs to take a road trip to Memphis. You simply can't name your place \"chicken and waffles\" and serve your namesake in such a mediocre manner."}
{"text":"I had excellent service and the food was delicious look out Roscoes you got some competition"}
{"text":"First off our waiter Sparky was an amazing gentleman! He suggested multiple classic items from the kitchen everything we got down to the chicken and waffles had a outstanding flavor and unique soul food Midwest look and vibe. I'm truly amazed las Vegas has added a little country fried soul to the table."}
{"text":"Hi, Welcome to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles. I would like to say we were greeted right away, but that would be a lie. There were about 5 of us at the door waiting to be greeted. Phone in the hostess desk was ringing and someone ran to answer that. The worker gave some info to the phone caller then left to do other work. Finally we were greeted and given a 10 minute wait time. Time was accurate. Our drink order was taken immediately, however took a while to return.. I had their signature beer and it was very flat, with very little flavor. I ordered a 2 piece with red beans and rice, side of Mac-n-Cheese. Josie had Breast and a waffle. I have been to the one in phoenix, and do not recall it being as open and loud as this place was. Now, for the chicken. Mine was 2 bites of meat and layers of breading. was hoping for some crisp skin but it was practically burnt. the meat of the chicken once I got to it was very dry. 2 thighs with too much breading and 2 bites of dry meat. I don't recall the waffles being as thin as they were when I had eaten at a different LO-Lo's. Josie's chicken breast was like eating saw dust. I was really hoping to have an awesome review about juicy chicken and flavorful food. The Mac-n-Cheese was just okay. Very cheesy but as for flavor it was sadly lacking. (once again a victim of my own Mac that is quite good) Red beans had flavor however the rice was very undone. 

It was very busy here and seemed quite popular. I will admit I am a Vegas boy and not from the south. I would hope, however I would know good chicken when I had it. It was very loud with children about the place being quite noisy. (Parents) ugh!!!.
Thank you for Dining at LO-Lo's. I can not say I will go here again. Not with so many more excellent options in Vegas. Maybe you all will have a better experience than we did. I cannot myself recommend going here. As we left there was not a goodbye greeting even though 3 employees standing by door."}
{"text":"Excellent crispy chicken, those green beans are the bomb. To top it off you get to meet NBA hall of famer.  Kevin Johnson so basically it's a win/win either way you put it."}
{"text":"Came here last night the food was good we had the fried green beans, cat fish beinget's, and the tenders and waffles I would have gave it more stars but the service was slow waited 15 minutes for water and extra plates had to actually ask twice and when they offered to remake the waffles it took almost a half hour! Working in the restaurant industry as a sous chef that is just unacceptable!! Overall the food and flavors were pretty good will be back again to give it another try."}
{"text":"Sooo tell me why I order a burger with no onions and no bacon, but I get both. Then another person in my order group orders WAFFLES and we don't ever get them because they \"forgot\" once, then forgot again and burnt them!!! We waited around 40 minutes to get food, on top of a long day."}
{"text":"One of the worst eating establishments I've been to in awhile. Saw the sign on the way to Applebee's, read the yelp reviews and decided why not. Upon arrival we were seated quickly but being greeted for drinks took 15 mins and having our order taken took another 15 on top of that. After the initial 30 mins another lady stopped by our table to explain that there was only 2 waiters working which was why the delay. As if the 30 mins wasn't enough, the even longer wait for the food was even worse. 

Upon getting our food the chicken was old, stale, over cooked, and plain dry. The waffles were dry and seemed as if they we had been sitting under a heating lamp somewhere. The macaroni and cheese was.... Different to say the least. The only good thing was the drinks. Well, most of them anyway. The lemonade was a no go from the start. The sweet tea was good the first glass but the second glass tasted like they switched the batch with over brewed, unsweetened tea. The kool-aid was probably the best thing there but definitely reminiscent of the kool-aid that you made back in the hood... Super sweet. They brought out some complimentary corn bread for the long wait that was pretty much on par with the rest of the meal. Overall, not a good dining experience. 

When we asked to speak with the manager we had an additional 20 min wait before my husband went looking for her himself. He was then advised by the manager of how he was the 3rd person to complain about the food in the past hour. The manager went to look at the food and advised she could understand our disappointed because it looked as if we were served all old food and decided to comp us the whole meal. She apologized for the inconvenience and hoped that the experience would not dim our view of the restaurant and that we would come back and give them another chance at a later time."}
{"text":"There are a few times in life where I heard people eat salad before it's served with dinner, here they do not, serve the salad first please. The meal that I had was excellent though, catfish, rice and gravy cornbread you can can't go wrong. Please
support your local businesses, and don't just read the bad reviews experience it for yourself. Now go get your grub on!"}
{"text":"Greetings Yelper's its been a minute since I left a review good or bad..this place was very clean and the service was on point. Marci was our server, not really gonna say negative things about her servicing skills. She was over all very pleasant, and her co-workers' stepped in to assist her throughout our experience here. I will definitely go back here, I am sorry there's no photo because my fluffy butt was famished and forgot I was suppose to take a snapshot first before taking a bite yikes! Lol..nevertheless this will go down as my First Real Southernly Friendly Food Restaurant since I've been in Vegas. Everything was seasoned to perfection, great job to the proprietors as well. Without complimenting them things wouldn't be as good. Lastly to the owner of this establishment, continue to do all things \"Impossible\" to keep your place running smoothly. Loved everything about your restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is super slow. I won't come back. I rather go to Roscoe in Cali if I want my chicken and waffle fix."}
{"text":"First time in and although it was a Sunday, mid morning, the wait was only 15 minutes. Service was great even though the server explained they had two no-call, no-shows, just that morning. Good was awesome."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. 30 minutes to get a cup of coffee and our food came out about an hour and a half after we sat down. We asked for utensils but they ran out. Food was decent but not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"The brother wanted us to try this place. Well, we wanted mom and dad to try the waffles and chicken dish since they have never had it. Based on the reviews, we must have hit a good day. We didn't have a lunch wait at all. Our server seemed busy, but he made sure to check up on us throughout our time there. It also felt like a sports bar because of all the TVs around. 

I can't remember exactly what my dad had, but he didn't go the waffles route. He had chicken and a side of the mac and cheese. As a side, it looked like a pretty decent portion. Mom went for the #13 (two chicken pieces, rice and beans). Important thing to note: they don't allow substitutions with any of the sides. Me? I wanted a mimosa. As soon as I saw it on the menu, my mouth began to water. For $8, it was served in what looked like a stemless wine glass. It didn't seem like much, but I guess if it was served in a champagne glass, then it was. I also got the Aunt Portia's omelette, which included fried chicken pieces, cheese, red and green bell peppers, and onions. It was a large omelette, but I barely had any chicken. It was kind of disappointing, but the omelette overall was not bad. It's what I would make at home. 

There is a location at the airport. I quickly glanced at the menu, but options are definitely limited there than at the restaurant. Good thing to know if I get stuck at the airport again."}
{"text":"I have given this place my last chance. Wasn't impressed when we got poor service 3 weeks after they first opened. We decided to go after a long work day and I was willing to give them another try because I was hungry for their gizzard dinner. The hostess seats us, the place is not busy. We saw 2 other tables get waited on before us. No one seemed to notice we were there. We put our menus down which is an obvious sign we were ready to order a drink and our meal. We watched other servers move around, a person that appeared to be in a managerial position look busy. No one came to our table. I'm a former hostess so I know someone should have gotten to us. Well Lo Lo's we are done with you. We got up gave our menus back to the hostess and said no one ever came to our table. Disappointing. We went right into Pomo and had a fabulous meal and service by Christine. If you want mediocre food and service then Lo Lo's is your place."}
{"text":"The gf and I got here at roughly 9:30 and there wasn't any wait.  That was the refreshing part.  

We ordered the Lolo's special and the breakfast special.  Lolo's special includes three pieces of chicken and two waffles for $13.  I had the breakfast special that had two biscuits, two eggs, grits and bacon.  I ordered a side of gravy.

It took about 20 minutes for the order come in.  Oddly enough, we were the first to order and the last to get our food.  And by the way, we had to remind our server of our order in order to get it.  

When I got my food, I started eating and apparently, she forgot my eggs.  

Long story short, there were many things wrong with the service.  No sorry for the delay or anything, all we got was that it was busy.  However the server right next to us appeared to take care of her guests.

I will come back for take out, but not for dine-in.

She does not deserve a penny."}
{"text":"The blue cool aid is pretty good not too sweet. The ice tea, if you ask for sweet you will get what you ask for, it's extremely sweet. 

We ordered the fried gizzards which my husband loves. It doesn't come with any special sauce but the hot sauce they had on table went well with it.

The chicken was very flavorful, the waffle had a hint of cinnamon, eggs & house potatoes were ok and the grits was kinda chunky. Overall I would only come back for just the chicken."}
{"text":"If you like grease this is the place to go. Their chicken doesn't even taste good. If I want greasy chicken I would rather go to KFC. At least their chicken tastes great. I won't be back to Lo-Lo's"}
{"text":"I love GOOD chicken and waffles. Maybe I'm just spoiled by Roscoe's but this was mediocre at best. 

I order 2 thighs and waffle with a side of collard greens and a sweet tea. The greens were tender with just the right amount of kick. The chicken had been fried in dirty grease and was really greasy. I ordered my waffle with no butter but it came with it anyway. I scraped it off into a napkin and the waiter took it with him. No offer to get me a new waffle without the butter in the middle, but okay. The waffle was okay. It was flat and soggy. The only flavor it had was cinnamon and was not crispy at all. Not even on the edges. The tea was actually really good. It wasn't overly sweet. 

My son ordered the country fried steak meal with Mac n cheese, collard greens and a sweet tea. The gravy was not the typical country and wasn't very good. The country fried steak was tough, greasy and bland. The corn bread muffin looked good but we didn't try it because it had a HUGE dollop of butter on top that made it mushy and unappealing. 

The Koolaid on tap is cool if you're 6. I doubt we'll be returning."}
{"text":"The food was so good. My girlfriend and I stuffed ourselves silly on chicken and waffles for lunch. The \"One Boob and Waffle\" plate was perfect for lunch. My friend swore by the sweet iced tea. But since I wasn't working a had the house Mojito that was so good! Our server was a little odd but in a good way and the entire staff was attentive to us. Definitely worth a stop. And the new place in Gilbert is clean and fun. Parking sucks a little with all the construction but I expect that to get better! Oh and we got there just before the lunch rush, it wasn't bad for us. So I would recommend an early or later lunch."}
{"text":"If you're up for waiting an hour (on a random Monday night) for heat lamp dry chicken and soggy undercooked waffles, this is your spot!!! We only went in because we had a coupon, which was directly from them and had no expiration, and they wouldn't honor it... ?! Horrible service, staff complained the whole time, slow slow slow, inedible food when it finally arrives. Ugh, just bad!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles is so good!  This is my first time here, but I've tried Rosco chicken and waffles and this place absolutely out performs  them.  The staff is fast and very attentive, the food is prepared with love and care.  The food is also prepared hot and fresh.  The servicing sizes are more than enough for one person and then some to share.  The restaurant does have a bar and a wide range of open seating, so no one will bump into you during your meal.  I say this is a must try place.  You won't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try lo-los chicken and waffles and we are so disappointed in how our first visit went. We heard it was busy so we tried to call ahead, we were told that if we downloaded their app we could put our name on this list... Wrong, that part of their app isn't working yet. So I called back to let them know and see if there was any way to get our name in. The girl on the phone told us no and that the wait \"wasn't that long, about 20-25 min\" so we decided to head down as we live fairly close. When we arrived the 20-25 min wait had turned into an hour. We questioned why they told us 20-25 min on the phone about 10 min ago... They responded with \"oh I don't know, I didn't tell you that and we got busy\" not a way to start out but we really wanted to try it so we decided to stick it out. When we finally got our table that was barely big enough for 2 we waited for about 20 min before our server (brad) even took our drink order. He kept saying \"just give me one more min\" and would run to a table that had been seated after us. Finally we got our drink and food orders in and then... We waited and waited and watched an entire family who sat down at the same time we did, eat their appetizers, their meals and get the check. We asked brad when we finally caught him how much longer our appetizer would be. He disappeared for about 20 min and when he came back he said it would be right out. Another 15 min later it showed up and immediately following it was our meal. I usually like to eat our apps before the meal but whatever we were hungry and we weren't going to complain. I felt terrible though, for a family of 3 with a young daughter who was about 10. They were seated about 20 min before us and we were finished eating before their food arrived. 

All in all I will say the food was delicious but it was not worth the incredibly long wait. We Ended up being there for about 3 hours. We arrived at 5 and left at 8 after waiting forever for our check to finally come.  The service is just terrible, I wouldn't have minded waiting longer had they simply apologized for the wait. Instead, we were met with rude servers and what appeared to be mangers who were in way over their heads. They all need to be retrained in how to treat their customers. Someone also needs to come in and rearrange how their staffing is set up. They need more servers on the floor so they have more time to take care of their customers simple needs (like drink refills and napkins) and they need to get rid of the 8 girls just standing up front checking people in. 2 people would very easily be able to check people in and it wouldn't seem like such a cluster of chaos. 
We will not be coming back for quite a while and we've already started to warn all our friends to stay away until the kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Lolo's, when I am craving for delicious mouth watering calorie-fillled meal - it's hands down this place.Chicken is very tasy, the skin is crispy and the meat is juicy!  Beans is very good. I don't like their waffles though. It is soggy and ordinary. Their sweet tea is the best!"}
{"text":"Food is good however the lack of customer service was terrible. We waited forever to be greeted, served a drink and to get someone to take our order. Remind you we sat in the bar. The bartender was no where to be found. She came 20- 30 min later asking if she could help...Um no! The restaurant was NOT pack at all so there was no excuse. The serving staff and bartender needs to take advice and learn from their Phoenix location. Good food doesn't makeup for lack of customer service."}
{"text":"I was expecting more since the restaurant was so hyped up. The chicken was horrible. It was over cooked and chewy & they used old grease to cook it in. The chicken was so bland no seasoning what so ever. My waffle was good, but then again, who can mess up a waffle. Will never go back here again. The koolaid, horrible. You can taste the aspartame, so strongly."}
{"text":"Soul food my foot...this place was just okay. Ordered the sample platter with fried chicken and waffles...it was very plain tasting and left nothing to crave. I love southern food that kisses the soul...but this place was very commercial tasting at best. Sorry I really wanted to like it. Price was steep due to location and service was actually great. Our waitress was really engaged and very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Placing a to-go order at Lo-Lo's on a Sunday afternoon is probably not the wisest thing to do. With that being said, we experienced a little hiccup with our order. Thankfully, the GM was eager to resolve the matter.

My husband and I ordered the fried okra, 3 wings & 2 waffles, 3 fingers & a waffle, and a side of fries. The fried okra tasted like my great aunt from Arkansas was in the kitchen cooking. The wings were well seasoned, and the fingers were dinosaur sized. 1.5 fingers is the equivalent of eating five fingers - no joke. The portion size of the fries were generous too. Cinnamony is the word that comes to mind to describe the waffles. They are not the star of the show, but make a decent co-star. 

Full disclosure, Kool Aid was never served in my parent's home, so I'm not a Kool Aid aficionado, but my husband is. He claimed that their grape Kool Aid had the perfect sugar to water ratio. So, feel free to get a Jar of Drank.

The next time that I have a hankering for some soul food, I'll be sure to dine in (mid-week of course)."}
{"text":"My newly found local spot off the strip! I would have to say this establishment really impressed my family and I.  Not sure about the low reviews but let me tell you, our experience was nothing but excellent! We had a large party of 15 and we were fully accommodated even when it was 30 mins until closing. No one had an attitude as a matter of fact they insisted that we stay. Our food came out nice and hot, chicken was juicy and well seasoned, waffles were light and fluffy. My niece received a free jumbo size Koolaid because her order took a little longer than everyone else. Our waiter \"Sparks\" was exceptional and came by to refill our drinks and checked to see if we needed anything. If they were bad in the past that is no longer the case. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Incompetent.
I only gave this place one star so I can leave this review. 
When my boyfriend and I walked in, (my boyfriend is white and I am Filipino) I was like ok, ambiance seemed cool, the music is my taste and who doesn't like chicken and waffles? Boy, were we wrong to choose this place. If you are not of darker shade then what I am, don't expect the same welcome as everyone else. 

We asked for a booth and the girl seating us TOLD us where to sit. Didn't SHOW us to our seats. Should have known that it was going to be bad. Once seated our server didn't greet us right away. We looked through the menu and drank menu and after 10 mins she finally came. 
Mind you, this is our very first time here. 

We ordered our drinks, my boyfriend ordered a Fat Tire beer and I ordered an OJ with an extra glass of ice. After a few mins, the bartender came up and told us they didn't have Fat Tire, so instead he ordered a Coors Lite. Then after another 5-6 mins, the bartender told us they didn't have coors lite. If you can't even stock coors lite at your establishment and you have a drink menu that is supposedly stocked as a full bar, then you should take away the whole thing. Come on, it's a Sunday and people will be drinking if you say you have a full bar!!! Anyways he just decided to get water. For water, you would still have to wait. 

Now it has been a good 15-20 mins and we didn't get our food ordered because they couldn't find any beers at their bar. Finally! Virginia our server, comes back with water and OJ and gets our food order. My boyfriend ordered Ivan's chorizo scramble with potatoes. Just like in the picture on their menu and I ordered the #9 two piece chicken with one waffle.  After another 15-20 mins, someone other than Virginia, brought our food over. Virginia did not come over to Check on us to make sure our food that came over was good. Unfortunately, my boyfriends order was wrong. He ordered the Ivan's chorizo scramble and asked for over easy eggs instead with potatoes. Eggs were over hard, there were no potatoes, the chorizo looked like dog food and they charge you an extra $1 for potatoes and there weren't any. 

After leaving the plate at the end of the table, finally someone noticed after a good 10 mins that my boyfriend wasn't eating. Told them this is not what he ordered and we wanted to speak to a manager. I ate my food in 10 mins so we could get outta there and still no manager. 

Still no manager, still no server, still bad service. We were waiting for the check for so long that if we decided to just walk out they probably wouldn't even notice.  The place was not packed at all, there were many employees around doing tasks and no customer servicing. 

Finally got our check, and they took out my boyfriend's order. So we started to feel a little better about the place, but when they gave me the credit card receipt to sign, they charged me more than what the original receipt was. What, they charged me extra for a \"white boy tax\".?!?? I was so upset, by this time we were both livid. So livid about our experience that I wasn't going to wait another hour for them to fix it. I attached a picture of both receipts and you tell me how this is right. It's not, it's criminal. This place is a joke. DO NOT RECOMMEND this place at all."}
{"text":"Really disappointing...service was inattentive and very slow, food was cold took forever to get, very expensive..."}
{"text":"Ugh!! Food is mediocre and over priced but the atmosphere is worse! Sat at a table at 10pm and it's very slow and my table was disgusting. Food and and condiments were all over the table, walls, and seats like what the hell. Cups have crusted juice and food chunks on them! And lastly people, be careful you don't sit underneath any air conditioning units because the condensation that drips from them will soak you and your seats. Good luck! (:"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere.  Ordered a waffle and breast.   Some fries and a beer.   It was all really tasty.   But took a bit long.  The bartender was very pleasant.  The experience overall was quite nice.  Hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"Can't rate the food because we never got the chance to have some. After being seated at a high top in the bar area we spent over 10 minutes watching waitstaff, not 6 feet from us, stand around telling personal stories, laughing and joking with a group at another table, even just standing in a group of three doing nothing! finally another waiter appeared and came to the table, quickly mumbled \"ready to order?\" No \"welcome to Lo-Los\", no \"sorry it took me a while to get here\" nothing. Since we had been discussing whether we thought we might have to wait forever for our food I turned to my husband and said \"I'm not sure after it took this long to be waited on\". I was thinking he might take the hint and offer an apology but no...instead he said, \"fine, I'll get a manager\" and walked away. Not sure what he expected a manager to do but after another 5 minutes of nobody approaching our table we got up to leave. Stopped at hostess desk and explained why we were leaving and the hostess had us tell a manager. In all honesty, I don't think the manager really cared. Got the impression some of the staff we complained about might be her friends. No offer to make it right in any way. Sad, because we always try to support new places in our neighborhood, but this was bad enough that we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice . Great music . Bottomless kool aid / mimosas. Chicken was a little over cooked but overall the food was good . Our waitress was beyond great . I loved the art work around the restaurant. I would come back"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for a while. Heard really good things about there food so I decided to give it a try. I ordered there soul food dinner I got a piece of catfish and the chicken tight with their collard greens mashed potatoes and brown gravy with a biscuit. Oh my God let me tell you it was so delicious. Everything was so favor full. I also got the melon mojito which is the best mojito I have had. My server FAITH was amazing she's very personable a made sure I had everything that I needed thank you faith. I definitely will be back and tell my friends about this place."}
{"text":"I knew it was gonna be good,but I got excellent service  food and the staff were beyond friendly, can't wait to go back. Just as good maybe a little better than Roscoe enough said."}
{"text":"This Lolo's isn't worse than the one in Phoenix.  Why is the rating so low?  I took my Father here, as I've been to the one in Phoenix a few times and love it.

They have the best fried chicken and damn good waffles.  A huge jar of iced tea, fried chicken, and waffles gets a smile ear-to-ear.

I love this place!"}
{"text":"Lolos problems seem to be following them from location to location. The wait staff is always friendly enough, however the consistency of the meals being quality has gone down significantly.  Today, I brought my kids to the new location in gilbert hopeful they were putting their best foot foward and serving great food. I should have had chick fil a. My chicken sandwich looked good enough, but the bottom of it was burnt. Gee thanks. Awesome especially considering it was 11 bucks. I also asked for my fries to be slightly undercooked. Wrong again, I got a batch that had been sitting for idk how long, they certainly weren't cooked any time recent.  Then, I got a waffle and 2 drumsticks, and a mac and cheese for the kids. I must've gotten the day before leftover mac and cheese or something, not sure why it was all cut up. Not cheesey, just crappy. The waffle seemed to be fine. Bravo. My daughter quickly pushed away her plate of the chicken drumsticks, saying she was full. I inspected the chicken both were burnt as though they were a few hours old. Yum. So I asked for a manager who took 10 minutes to speak to me, I wanted to talk outside I don't like to complain and not in front of people. But after I finally sat back down,the people next to me were served what looked like a beautifully cooked meal. I'm not gonna call the racial card but I'm not saying maybe they don't like white people... just a thought. .. the manager offered to make me new chicken and replace the mac and cheese. After waiting 30 min to get shitty food the last thing I wanted to do was wait with all eyes on me for complaining, for more shitty food. Sorry lolos. You don't live up to your hype. I paid my 40 bill and left. I'll never go back. They care about what that want to care about. And it's clear it's money."}
{"text":"Normally I would rate this place 5 I don't know what the hell going on in that kitchen the food was warm I ate cause I'm hungry. Still late on correcting my homies order   Gotta say LoLo's you dropped the ball this time. And this my spot when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!  I have never been to a restaurant that exudes such an attitude of ambivalence toward the customer.   We met there for a family brunch (6 people) last Saturday but didn't even get to eat.  Three of us got there early because we had heard there was a wait.  Then they wouldn't seat us because the other 3 people were still 5 minutes away. I told them that I would like to get seated and place our order because I had an appointment afterward.  Nope - they didn't care.  You have to wait to get in and then they told us is would take 45 minutes for our orders to be prepared... RIDICULOUS!  That is flat out poor management and/or understaffed unprepared kitchen!  This was 10:30 am mind you.  They obviously don't need my business.  We went next door to ZinBurger and had the most amazing burgers ever."}
{"text":"The food is good, the service could use some major improvements. I would give it 4 or 5 stars based on the food alone, but the service is just that bad. Lazy and slow servers."}
{"text":"Tried to place a to-go order over the phone and I was told by Debra that they dont do that; only dine-in. 

That's very strange considering we saw someone pick up a to-go order when we were there waiting for a table about a week ago.  I guess they do not want our money any more?"}
{"text":"1 star service, 1 star quality of food. 

Service: Their service was unprofessional, to say the least. Never in my life have I ever received such crappy, unwelcoming service at a restaurant. The hostesses were what started it off all wrong. Just plain rude and immature. The wait for a table was well over 30 minutes, which was whatever, I kind of expected it with them being a new \"hot spot\". But the wait for our food was also WELL over 30 minutes as well. But what made it even more annoying is that the waiter would come to our table every 15 minutes and say \"It'll be just one more minute for the chicken to finish guys.\" And he was such an awkward server too. Whenever he'd check on our table he wouldn't say the normal \"You guys doing okay?\" Or \"Can I get you anything else?\", instead he'd stand right next to our seats and just hover over our table without saying a single word. Awkward. 


Food: I ordered the Betty's Boob, which was described on the menu as 1 succulent chicken breast and 1 delicious waffle. All very true... minus the \"succulent\" and \"delicious\" part. I found it funny how the server kept claiming the wait was for the chicken yet our chickens came out either burnt or dry. And there was no way in hell we were about to send anything back and wait another 30 minutes for new chicken. I ended up just eating half of my chicken till I decided I was over it, then ended up giving the other half to my cousin cuz his chicken came out burnt and nasty. As far as the waffles, everyone's right, they're not horrible but they're super soggy. The waffle was the only thing I finished on my plate. 

I don't know if we came on a bad day or on a day they decided to schedule all the crappy workers together, but my experience was NOTHING like what I read on some of the other reviews lol. 

Hopefully this place will get its act together in the next couple of months. It'd be nice to be able to get some good chicken and waffles without having to drive all the way to Cali for some."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim on a Friday 3/17/2017 evening for a pretty early dinner. This was my first time here and I got the #7 which I had 2 chicken thighs with a waffle and I also ordered a side of macaroni & cheese. My hunni ordered a 3 piece chicken with the waffle, grits and scrambled eggs with cheese & onion. Our order came out surprisingly quickly. First thing I noticed was that our chicken appeared to have been cooked in oil that needed to be changed. The looked \"almost burnt\". However I could taste the seasoning and it was very well seasoned. The mac & cheese was nothing to write home about and to me it tasted like kraft deluxe mac & cheese. Now the waffles were amazing and I don't care for cinnamon very much and it was just enough cinnamon to my liking and the butter was rich like I like it."}
{"text":"This place has only been open for a few days but they will have their grand opening in less than a week. Their soft-opening menu has less items than their actual menu but all you need in your life are chicken and waffles. There was a wait when we went - everyone seems to be excited about this place! Which makes perfect sense because a lot of people appreciate chicken and waffles without having to go to California for Roscoe's or pay lots for the same dish on The Strip.

If Roscoe's and Famous Dave's had a love child , it would be Lolo's. And just like any new business, there are kinks to be fixed but it's alright - no biggie! Erika was our server and she's fantastic! She was very friendly and she made sure we got our food hot and fast.

Spicy Corn Fritters:
Hot bite-size pieces of mildly spicy sweet corn that have been breaded and fried. Crunchy, sweet with a spicy love tap. They come with a dipping sauce that tastes like a combination of mustard and ranch. 4/5

They have chicken combinations galore. Chicken and waffles. Chicken, waffles and grits. Chicken with gravy. Chicken wings.

The KK's:
3 pieces of Southern-style fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits and eggs. You get a lot of food for $15. I was only able to eat half and took the rest to-go. And I'm not one who taps out easily but I didn't wear my extra stretchy pants. The chicken was not dry and the skin was crispy. The waffles have a hint of cinnamon and are the softer kind - it's all about texture and flavor contrast. You don't want everything to be crispy and savory! The scrambled eggs have onions and cheese - pretty tasty. The grits weren't clumpy but had good texture and lots of butter 4/5

They have sweet tea, and Kool-Aid (oh, yeah!). For dessert, they have red velvet cake, and banana pudding. Since I already had a food baby, I didn't get dessert. Everyone enjoyed their meal and we all ended up with to-go boxes."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Waitress told us immediately thst it woyld be 30 to 45 minute wait for all food but chicken & waffles.  We waited an hour at least.  Empty glasses most of the time and had to flag down waitress to find out about food.  Oart of our order was delivered and the manager came.  She argued with my mother-in-law for at least 2 minutes before I'm sorry ever came out of her mouth.  It was embarrassing.  They forgot to give three of us syrup with our waffles.  Food was okay, but not worth the wait.  Whatever you do .....don't order eggs evidently that is what slowed up our order.
Waitress was not good."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place since it opened up in Downtown Gilbert.  I've heard reviews from people and it has not been great, although I wanted to try it out for myself.  Went there last Sunday around 9AM..no wait time for a table, but it took 11 minutes for our server to even bring us water.  I ordered the Bacon Bloody Mary, and all I got was some tomato juice.  Told the server that I no longer wanted it.  He said he would have them fix it...my roommate wanted hers back, so the server, who seemed annoyed took both bloody marys and came back with both.  After I told him I didn't want mine.  When I told him for the second time, I don't want the bloody mary, he tossed it on the table and said to my roommate, well you can drink it - I'm only charging you for 1.
Then we waiting for another 16 minutes for him to come back and take our order.  I was getting to the point that I was ready to leave.  In that 16 minutes, the server set his tray on the customers table next to us, and everything dropped.  2 large glass mason jars - shattered on the ground where the 2 customers had to get up as to not get glass in their shoes.
Finally got the food.  I was 100% unimpressed.  The waffles to thin and bland.  The chicken was decent - but nothing to be excited about.

The service was horrible.  And the food would get a 1 star rating from me.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and the food is ok and the service is marginal. My 14 year old loves the place and chooses this place on his turn to choose a restaurant. I will never return to this place because my 8 year old daughter can not eat anything on the menu so we brought in her own. We were told we can not bring it in.. we brought in 1 Hot dog and Whitney told us this was not allowed. We spend on average of 100.00 everything every time we come to this establishment. Thank you for sealing the deal on us never coming back. Down town Gilbert has plenty of restaurants that WILL allow a child to eat a hot dog from an outside source. I gave 1 star because it only allows a minimum of 1 star."}
{"text":"I have heard so many good things about this place and frankly we were not impressed ~!   
The food was so bad that we sent it back~! It was so dry and looked like it had been under a heat lamp all day~! We will not go back~! Our server was the manager...She was so nice but everything else sucked~!  Dennys chicken would have been better and would not have cost $15 a plate~!  SO BAD THAT I DIDN'T EVEN TAKE A PICTURE~!  ; ("}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing customer service! The reason why I am writing a 5 star review is because the gentleman who dropped our food off asked to join us in the blessing over our meal! I truly hope you see this, because this was the nicest gesture I have ever encountered and brought tears to my eyes! Thank you for your kind words in prayer. Sometimes the work can be ugly and harsh.. but this man proved that there are still good people out there  thank you!!"}
{"text":"My daughter raved about this spot and so I ventured here with her on my last trip to Vegas. Located in a shopping center there was plenty of parking on a weekday afternoon. The restaurant is spacious with table and booth seating. Service was kind and attentive. They offer alcoholic drinks but I settled on a glass of water (served in a mason jar - cute), fried green beans, and an entree of three pieces of chicken, 2 waffles, eggs, and grits. I was really hoping they had fried pickles, the green beans were good but not very flavorful. The grits were smothered in butter and tasted lovely. Chicken was seasoned deliciously and cooked perfectly. Eggs were good but it's hard to mess those up. Had a peach cobbler for dessert... it was more like peaches, ice cream, and cake??? Not really a traditional peach cobbler with crust and gooey goodness. Still tasted okay but definitely not what I expected. When compared to my hometown fav, Roscoes, I like the chicken better here but Roscoes wins on the waffles. Lo-Lo's waffles were good but it's the chicken and grits that would bring me back."}
{"text":"Don't go to this Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles location. We tried to for our first time and decided to cancel our order and go somewhere else. 

They told us it would be $2 per shrimp for extra shrimp in our Shrimp & Grits. 

What?!?!?!?!

We've been going to Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles for 5 years in Scottsdale and on Central and wanted to try the newest location in Gilbert. But we will NEVER get a chance to because of an obvious error and a rude delivery of information. 

SMH. Y'all know I try to support all the Black Businesses I can and I just love good food but damn if some people don't make it hard."}
{"text":"I soooo wanted to give this place 5 stars, and based on the food taste & quality, it would have been....however, our first visit was less than stellar.   We must have been seated at the \"black hole\" table that is somehow cloaked in invisibility.    After watching for a half hour while multiple servers passed us by and waited on everyone else around us, we were finally able to flag one of them down....which wasn't an easy task in and of itself!   Finally....we ordered.   OK, good, fresh food takes a while to cook...I understand that and am fine with waiting.....but the drinks took another 15 minutes to get to us.    By now, I'm feeling as if we are being punished for asking someone to do their job, and had been nothing but cordial and understanding.    The food was outstanding!   The chicken & waffles is a must have item (I'm Southern and the chicken there took me back to my Grandma's chicken), and my husband's burger was wolfed down.     Not once did our waitress come back to check to see if we needed anything else...granted, their drinks are served in quart mason jars, but I had tea where all of the ice had melted and a side glass of ice would have been nice had I ever been able to ask for it.  We figured we just had a bad experience, and decided to go back a 2nd & 3rd time....with the same results.     The wait staff there is nothing short of horrible....or VERY poorly trained.   I swear they actually try to hide from customers.    I will still eat there....but carry out only.   No one has time for a 2 1/2-hour meal when it isn't a 7-course one.  The place was half empty all 3 times we visited when it should have been dinner service rush, and it isn't the food that is causing that problem.   If I were the owner, I would take these reviews seriously, and get a consultant in to help improve customer service, as that is the only reason you don't have a line out the door.   Your business will fail because of the poor service, and that's the only reason you got 3 stars instead of 5.     I so want to try breakfast there to see if it's better than dinner service, but no way I'm taking a chance on wasting that much time."}
{"text":"Food was great! Nate was a really great sever he made sure we were taken care of! I'd def go back for the service especially! I ordered the number 1 which was wayyy too much food ! So I have enough food for later!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's was bumpin on a Wed night at 8pm... and it was a rainy, dreary night.  That's gotta be a testament to how much peeps be loving the place.

I had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, but the waitress was very apologetic, acknowledging my patience, which was very nice.

I ordered the KK's with 3 thighs, because I'm not afraid of the dark.  When it arrived, my cheesy eggs looked a little runny, but the taste was all that, especially with the onions.

You may want to temper your use of the hot sauce.  The Lo-Lo's brand is very similar to Tabasco. 

The hot and fresh fried chicken was better than my grocery store's, and I think Fry's has a pretty good product. 

The waffle was reminiscent of Waffle House.  Why they gotta call it Waffle House?  They're not that good.  Truthfully, they should re-brand the \"house\" as \"Waffle Bungalow\".

You know who makes a great waffle?  Me!  So stop on by the next time I'm at your local Homewood Suites, and I'll whip you up a Belgian to remember

Everyone was incredibly friendly.  No less than 5 different people checked on me during my stay, one even patting me on the pack, but Christian was eggceptional!

I got 3 high-fives on my way outta the joint!  I felt like Aaron Carter, that time he beat Shaq"}
{"text":"So it's NOT Roscoe'a flavor. But the chicken is bigger than Roscoe's, greens are really good, service is GREAT, and they have a full bar full of great DRANKS (Blue Ivy alcoholic drink). So waffles could use vanilla/cinnamon cooked into the batter and the syrup could be warmed! Did I mention Excellent service!!! Prices are great...$7 for two huge thighs and a waffle - definitely can share this plate! Grits were very good and such a great variety of pancakes! My daughter had Oreo pancakes - extra huge portion with two pieces of bacon!!! The menu has a variety of other items - not just waffles and chicken. The ribeye steak and eggs and potatoes was phenomenal! Ribeye extremely well seasoned, tender and juicy. I'd highly recommend the ribeye and eggs, over the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome! We've only been here once before and the wait staff remembered us. Everyone is really friendly and great service. The food tastes great and you better come with an appetite since the portions are big and the food is filling. Comfort food, gotta love it!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the kool-aid is a MUST it is amazing!! I always get red but my husband loves the blue, you really can't go wrong picking either one.
We have been there a handful of times my go-to is the chicken and waffles it is amazing and so good! The environment is awesome the servers are so nice. If I could I would eat here every week. It's so good!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine came here and put a bad review and I was skeptical of going but the website looked like it was a cool and fun spot so my other friend and I decided to give them a chance. I was so happy that we did. The staff were so friendly funny and attentive. The food amazing! We had the phat azz samich and auntie Malaysia focheezy juicy hood burger but turned into hangover helper with fries. The bomb! Definitely coming back and bringing some friends. It's sucks my friend had a bad experience but I hope she gives the a 2nd try. I left a nice tip too since the staff were on point. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I made a yelp because this place was so bad. Easily one of the worst dining experiences ever and I eat out everyday. Liquor bottles full of dead bugs. I even told the bar tender she looks at the bottles and goes oh yeah and puts them back (look through photos) ants crawling across my table inside... If that wasn't bad enough to make you wonder what's going on in the kitchen then idk.  Food came out cold and they forgot everything extra I ordered so things were coming out late and cold. 5 hours after lolo my friend and I are both incredibly sick. I've been to other lolo in town but this one is a disgrace. Employees are lazy and grungy. Save your self the time and go to the barrio Mexican food next door it blows the doors off of lo lo's"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for some good ol' fried chicken and catfish!  The service is amazing and don't get me started on the food.  So glad they put a location in the east valley.  I'm able to visit more frequent.  I just love everything about this restaurant!  You can tell nothing but love is going into the preparation of the food, drinks, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was so hopeful for a good fried chicken joint. One of my favorite foods is fried chicken and this is not what I had in mind. 
We don't live nearby so it took a while for us to give it a try, I was hoping kinks would be ironed out and they had perfected everything, especially their namesake chicken.
I had a doctors appointment up the road so I suggested getting some Lo-Lo's to take home afterward. It took quite a few minutes for someone to actually take our order but everyone was friendly and the place is really nice. It didn't take too long to get our food, we only got fried chicken and waffles. It sure smelled good!
So the chicken has a nice crunchy coating on the outside but that was where the pluses turned to minuses. The chicken meat was dry and had no flavor, the outside coating had no seasoning it was just plain ole coating, blah! So dull! It was edible but not enjoyable. The waffle saved things, yes it was soggy but that was to be expected. It was yummy slathered in butter and syrup, it had a great cinnamon flavor to it, I would go back for just the waffles.
I highly doubt I'd go back, but if I did, I wouldn't get the fried chicken."}
{"text":"The food is fine but they really need to work on their service. It's sooooo slooooow.   I'm sitting here right now waiting for my check. Getting the servers attention was hard enough now 15 minutes later I still don't have my check. This place isn't even 1/3 full so it's not that he's too busy"}
{"text":"Really really bad service!  I had to walk out 
I was told after I ordered about 15 minutes later they ran out of catfish and okra. There were two waitresses and neither one seemed to give a care about our table even to the point that the table near us was served there food and they came in way after us. Not sure if it had to do w the color of my skin. I felt I was not wanted there along w my 2 daughters. Never going back. Place has gone downhill!!"}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant and it did NOT disappoint! Food was amazing, the atmosphere was great and our waitress was good! I ordered the catfish platter and it was amazing, the spinach was seasoned to perfection! I will definitely be back! B/C we live in a social media age, I could not check in at the Gilbert, AZ location on social media b/c it was not listed!"}
{"text":"Nice open space, nice decor, non-crowded bar area and a nice wrap around patio with shade! Way to go Lolo's! 5 stars for that! 
We went on a Tuesday early afternoon when we knew it wasn't going to be busy. (We know how Lolo's can get regardless of location) we were seated fairly fast. But seemed like the hostess was confused even though they weren't busy. She just assumed we wanted to sit inside, so without asking us she proceeded to lead us to a table and we quickly interrupted her to tell her we rather sit outside. Which for some reason seemed to delay her progress and halted her thought process. She then tried to re-group or whatever but it took her too long to determine where we could sit outside even though only two parties were out there already. So anyways we got seated and then we were greeted shortly afterwards for our drink orders. We got the drinks in less than 5 minutes. We ordered our food and the food came out in only about 15 minutes. 
They have their alcoholic drinks on the menu but don't have the license yet. That was a bummer. We should have been told that once we were seated; just as an FYI so we could have been prepared to order from the \"available\" drinks. 
The food here is GREAT! Made from scratch home cooking that is always consistent!! (I frequent Lolo's in Phoenix and Scottsdale when ever I'm in AZ and the Vegas Lolo's seems to be just as good) I ordered my usual: \"Nay Nay's\" (Two waffles, two eggs with a cup of grits then I add hot links on the side). I LOVE their waffles! The flavor is like no other and it's their staple recipe! DON'T ever change them! She got the chicken and waffles. The piece of chicken came out very over cooked. It should have never left the kitchen or even be served. But they are new so they still may be learning...idk. But no biggie because we never have a problem telling them to take it back. She then chose to get catfish which was delicious! Fried to perfection.

Overall there were some great things and then some things that weren't so great. They obviously need to tighten up their service when it comes to the hostess being unprepared, notifying us about what's not available from the menu and not serving over cooked food. I blame the waitress because she should be our advocate and let the kitchen know she wasn't going to serve food that is not up to the regular standards. But they all are new so that is something that can obviously be fixed easily and takes a little time. The food is great! Portions are great. And in a great atmosphere. And that trumps the small service issues they had so I am giving a solid 4 stars until I come back."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that the food at Lolo's is really good. I'm from Chicago where there is an over abundance of amazing food so I didn't think it was anything to write home about, but our waitress was amazing with the overload she was dealing with and very accommodating. But the food just didnt wow me but it was still good and at a very affordable price. The patron marg was fab! So if you are in the area and want brunch this is a solid option."}
{"text":"I so badly want to like this place, but over cooked chicken and under cooked eggs, these are basics for home style cooking. Fortunately service was better then at the airport location which was appalling, but they still need to get people turned quicker without risking food quality or experience."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and they have never pissed me off so much. Group of eight, everyone ordered after ordering Marcos our waiter comes back and informs us that they have no pancakes for over a week!! A week is too long for a machine to be broken where you can't make pancakes at a restaurant. Then informed my mother in law they don't have any chicken strips ! Excuse me as a business you make a trip to the grocery store and buy some chicken strips to make. The my grand mother meal came out with no eggs; 15 minutes later eggs come out after asking for them several times. Also asked for butter several times and guess what no butter until the waffle was too cold to melt the damn butter. So many apologies from Marcos but never made anything right for us by just doing your job!! My husbands breakfast also comes out no eggs but we didn't even bother to ask about them at this point I was over it and so was the other people at my table. This may have been my last visit here."}
{"text":"Lolos is definitely not better than Chicken and Waffles,  but don't get me wrong they are still  good.  I love love the Kool Aid on Tap,  I am currently pregnant, and that is one of my cravings.  Okay now on to the food. 

I got two pieces of Chicken, A breast, and a wing with a waffle.  Let's start off with the waffle.  It was a little soft and soggy, but it actually taste pretty good.  It had a cinnamon flavor.  The chicken was crispy,  and juicy.  The batter was a little thick, but over all good.  My husband got the same thing,  but covered and gravy, and said it didn't taste like gravy. It was a little spicy wich he liked,  but not what he was expecting.  My daughter got the Rib eye steak and eggs, the stake was burned at the edges and it was mostly fat, and veins,  the menu stated that it came with French fries,  but it came out with burnt squared spicy potatoes? Her meal was the worst.  She had some of my food instead.  

Now on to the service.  Man they were busy, and ooohh so slow. They sat us right away,  but seemed so unorganized. Like no one had a clue what to do. Don't get me wrong our server was very nice, we just didn't see her much."}
{"text":"We've been to the one in Arizona, so we got a little excited when we heard they were putting one here in the Vagas Valley. We went by a dozen times checking on their progress and finally they opened. 

My husband and I are early risers and so on the weekends we are always up and ready to go, today was no exception, our plan, to get a table at Lo-Lo's before the crowd shows up.

Quite surprised that at 830 on Saturday morning the place is nearly empty. We are seated right away, we notice lots of empty tables and lots of staff doing various things, and it seemed they where all to busy to notice we had sat down. 

Finally, an assistant server notice me making faces at him to get attention so someone could take our order. He got us drinks. 

After several more minutes a server noticed we where in her section and took our order, two number ones. Thats eggs, any way, grits, two waffles and three pieces of chicken, white or dark meat, I got mixed. 

Another long wait for the food, in the mean time the place got really busy. Tables of five to eight showing up all at the same time. 

Food finally arrived! The chicken was really crispy and golden brown, the crust stuck to the meat so I could get skin and juicey meat in one bite. The eggs, scrambled with cheese and onions, the grits with a big spoon of butter melting on top, and of course two golden brown waffles also with a spoon of butter melting and running all over. The syrup, warmed was delicious. 

Overall, food was great, there seemed to be a lot of staff but unorganized and lacking leadership, perhaps a sign of newness? 

We are eager to return and try the chicken fried steak!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's is a No No.  Please don't bother.  Went after attending the Komen Race for the Cure this morning.  Greeted and seated right away, which was good because they were quite crowded.  Waited to get drinks, waited to order and then really waited...really waited ...to get our food.  All dishes were LARGE.  More food then we could eat in 2 or 3 sittings.  Shrimp and Grits..shrimp good...not great, grits bland.  Waffle sandwich...bland.  biscuits and gravy were overwhelmingly large and more biscuit then anything else.  Service slow since person was covering bar and waiting tables, yet many standing at door.
If you are looking for lots of food,this is the place.  If you are looking for lots of food that taste as good as it looks, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Incredible poor service. Asked waitress to check order & manager came over to argue. Said service was slow because we ordered eggs & the order was not slow. Really? Mediocre food. Too many other happy spots to eat in Gilbert."}
{"text":"We arrived and place was busy but not overly crowded so I was a little surprised when I was told that there would be a ten to fifteen-minute wait for our party of six. We decided to wait because I was told the food was really good. After twenty minutes I asked the hostess why it was taking so long when other parties had come in after us and were already seated. She told me that they were waiting on a large booth to sit us in. I asked her why they couldn't just push two tables together and she said that the management doesn't like for them to do that because it confuses the wait staff. After another ten minutes we were taken to a small booth that was too small for all of us. I told her that we needed something else so she pushed two tables together for us and brought out our drinks. We waited another 25 minutes before I asked for a manager. The manager, Bobby Jean came to our table and I explained to her the situation about the table and how it had been an hour and ten minutes since we walked in the door and not one person had come to the table to see if we were ready - no one even acknowledged that we were there. She apologized and said she would get someone to wait on us right away. 

Our waiter, Roy was very nice and apologetic. He took our order and made sure that we had refills when we needed them. The manager came up to check on us and to let us know that our order would be out shortly.  Once the order came out I have to say that everything was really good. I had the chicken fried steak and I have to admit I was a bit surprised that it was topped with a brown gravy rather than the more traditional white sausage gravy I'm used to having.  The first bite seemed a little spicy, but after that I was happy with the taste. I also had buttered corn and whipped potatoes. The one spoonful of buttered corn that I had was great - my three-year niece ended up taking the corn and eating it by the handfuls. The whipped potatoes tasted like they had sour cream and were just a little bit too salty for me, but I don't usually put extra salt on my food. 

Once we got passed the fact that we had to wait so long to be seated and then had to wait even longer to be served, I would say the food was good. I don't know that I will be going back anytime soon just because of the wait and the fact that no one acknowledged us as we sat there. I will say that the manager Bobby Jean comped our meal so that was really great of her to do."}
{"text":"The service in this location was great and we were able to beat the crowd on a Friday night by going about 4:45. I ordered the 3 pc chicken and it was terribly dried out and had very little flavor. The sweet potatoes are pretty good as was the fried okra but I didn't care for the gravy. I'm a southerner and can make gravy at home that is much better than what they served. The sweet tea is like drinking pure sugar so I had the waitress mix mine with unsweet tea and then it was really good. I am not sure I will go back."}
{"text":"So it was pretty slow when we came in got seated right away and the waitress was super friendly and the food came out fast. And I really love the decor in the place. 
Now the food my chicken in waffles the lo lo plate was absolutely amazing and fresh. And my wife got the yo mamas biscuits and gravy. ( hard to find a good plate of this any where) I liked it but the gravy had to much onions for her. Ur she loved the potatoes and the biscuit was super fluffy over all we will be back to try more another day"}
{"text":"That place is a waste of time and money, the food is completely tasteless and the service is very slow. Reading the history it states the recipes were handed down... it taste like the ingredients were left out one at a time from each generation. I would never tell anyone to go there,  STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Very underwhelmed. We came on a Saturday afternoon. It was busy but not packed. The service was slow. The fried green tomatoes were flavorless and had no seasoning. We both had the shimp & grits, the shrimp were overcooked and also under seasoned. There was supposed to be 7 shrimp to an order, I got 5
 It took me 15 minutes to get a waitress  (not ours).
The biscuits were good. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here to try something new, I had a craving for fried chicken that day so we decided to check this place out. We walked in and we were immediately greeted with kindness and a smile so we figured so far, so good. Boy, were we wrong.

The place is huge to start off (not a bad thing particularly, but it's intimidating), we were sat down and a few minutes go by, our waitress finally comes up to the table. As kind a woman as she seemed to be, she also seemed exhausted like she didn't want to be there anymore. She takes our drinks down, another good few minutes go by and we finally get them. Mine was just an ice water and my boyfriend had gotten tea of some kind. She asks if we're ready to order and we say yes, I had gotten the pecan salad (I believe) and he had ordered a medium rare burger. We wait, and wait, and wait some more, finally about 40 minutes go by and out comes out food.

Except our waitress was gone. She had left in the middle of our dining in and gone home. Maybe it's just me, but who does that? Don't they at least finish off a table they have beforehand? Or at least stop by to tell us someone else will be serving us?

The chicken in my salad was dry and old, as though it had been left out for days before being used, I found a HAIR in my food, and there was no flavor whatsoever. My boyfriends burger came out rare, nearly raw and inedible. The guy who took over never came by to refill our drinks- or at least waited until the glasses were completely empty and ice was at a quarter mark on the cups. And to top it all off, he gave us the WRONG bill for another table that was at least 100+$! Pay attention to the table your serving so they don't have a damn heart attack over this stuff! When we got our actual bill it for 30-40$ for crappy food. We ran away and will never, ever, come back. Stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"It's a shame, but I gotta \"go in\" on this. We've been to the flagship establishment in AZ, especially the original location downtown behind the ballpark.. We were happy&  excited to hear they opened doors out here in LV so we decided to put it on the must do list...Why did we do that, on the day we did?? We were greeted promptly then it was all bad from there. Found a seat for our party and put in our drink orders n ordered an appetizer. Got our kool-aid n was catfish in decent time, but man, after that, ...all downhill like...
We decided on menu items n placed order, n that was literally the last time we saw our waitress (at least at our table) We waited and waited and waited after about 45-50 min our food finally made it to the table, by another table staff ( thank you) I appreciate her for not forgetting about us... 
Absolutely No check in after getting our drinks. An occasional , \"do you need anything\", \"how's is everything with your drink/appetizer\" or not even \"how's everything\"???
absolutely no follow up with our table. We got better service at the gas station filling up before driving there from across town. .. We ordered the red velvet pancakes and they came with some type of \"orange flavored\"  (not cream cheese) cream cheese icing.. (Usually cream cheese n powdered sugar) clearly this was not. Absolutely gross, not eating that,n made the red velvet cakes dry not even worth attempting to eat. (Shoulda just went to baby stacks). I got the Lo lo's : was 3 pieces of chx n waffle, eggs n grits. Grits were drowned in /margarine or whatever they drowned them in, too much tho. Waffle Taste like cinnamon, not how I've had any waffle ever before. They must be tweaking recipes bc the food wasn't made this way in AZ.. Either way just a word of advice to mgmt, train your wait staff on customer service bc we would have immediately notified of the discrepancies but they were nowhere to b found, since bringing the drink order to our table she was GHOST!!The chx was ok, nothing to write home about or compel me to return and pay for underwhelming food, NO table service, no thanks. Making bad even worse, after we decided against allowing them to \"make it right\" since we see the place filling up by the minute and it already took 45 to get our food, n no follow up, we decided,\"mmmm good, miss me w that shhh\" we decided to just let fellow yelpers read this and consider yourself warned.. Not sure if personality is considered when hiring but, there's too many options out here to eat at, as far as Lo lo's LV, I'll pass, one n done.. 
\"Check Please\"....and a box so I can make this not a complete loss, my dog may like it. 
Hold up, now All of a sudden, out of the sky, it's a bird, no it's a plane, NOoo, it's; \"Our waitress\" where UUUU BEEN AT??? Lol.,
And now it's time to leave and you \"hover\" and carefully watch us sign our receipt?  us table while we are signing our receipts as if we are going to bless you gracefully for not even checking on us 1x while we are there. I'm cool, were cool, completely cool off Lo-Lo's in LV.. 
Wats with the customer service here ????????"}
{"text":"Didnt understand why the stars were so low here since we have gone several times in AZ. Then I went..... First- the hours listed online are wrong and they dont open until 11am. They have a paper taped to the front with new hours.  They are understaffed...food took forever. Will be hard to get me to go back"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. The place was pretty empty and service wasn't too great. I ordered the Momma's whites which included chicken, grits, home fries, and a biscuit. The grits were pretty flavorless even with a huge pad of butter just tasted like mush. The chicken was oily and the biscuit was kinda dry. My favorite part probably was the home fries but even that was kinda oily. I didn't leave wowed and I most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Way over rated.  Long waits, slow kitchen.  Food comes out cold and one plate at a time.  There was five of us and two dishes came out about 35 minuets after we ordered them and the other three came out about 10 minutes later including the syrups for the first two already cold dishes.  Been twice and have had the same experience both times so we are done. I had hoped the first bad experience was just a fluke but it seems to be the rule."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were great and our server Roy was attentive and helpful! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm from the south and most restaurants never get it right. The greens were fresh ..the mac and cheese was on point. The portions size was more than enough. We will be back. Shaniece gave great service"}
{"text":"Had to try it to see what all the hype was. It was...ok. I'll admit, I don't usually like sugar on my meat, the whole waffles with chicken and syrup was really weird and didn't go together for me. The catfish appetizer was good though. Portion size was also good."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to Lolo's, it had been on my breakfast bucket list.  I like the concept of southern food, mason jars, gospel music on Sunday, but the food & service fell very short.  The chicken was ok, the waffles I felt were just like eggo waffles. If that is what you are known for, it better be amazing. I've had better at Hash House in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food and service tonight was awesome!!

We had a server, by the name of Roman, who was amazing!  He was new and still in training, definitely knew how to take care of his customers. Stupid Fries were soooo yummy!! Chicken and waffles, delish as always. My hubby and mom tries the red beans and rice which were pretty nasty but I'm still giving a 5 because Roman asked how they were and when we said we didn't love em, he didn't hesitate and offered to get them any other side they wanted."}
{"text":"Git the LoLo side if fries and corn fritters.  Absolute delicious our 1st tine here and Dobdra was exceptional!!!!"}
{"text":"We waited 35 minutes for our food. I was never asked for a refill on my coffee. My waffle was cold and did not taste good at all. My wife ordered wheat toast with her breakfast. When she was able to catch up to our waitress she asked about her toast. The waitress told her they had no more wheat toast she asked for white toast which was never brought. My friend had to ask 3 times for a to go box. When the check was brought the waitress said they hand no more covers to put it in. Terrible service all around."}
{"text":"To start off I'm from Cali and Vegas food completely sucks! We went to Lolos today for my birthday and it was a horrible experience! We waited about 20 mins for a table which wasn't that bad because we wanted a booth. The waiter took our drink order and took off only to come back 3 more times without our drink. Finally, Everyone gets their drinks (except for me because I ordered a mimosa) the kids get the lemonade and my 14 year old tells me to taste my youngest drink.... one sip and all I could taste were cups of sugar!!  My kids asked to change their drinks because it was too nasty. Finally he comes by to take our order and at that time the power goes out (according to the waiter for the second time)! He tells us he's going to put our order in manually and not to worry. He comes back 45 mins later and realizes we have no food but the people around us who came after us were getting their food. He says something about our order being deleted from the system because of the power outage but he told us he was going to put it in manually.... Maybe he forgot?? 
WE SAT THERE FOR OVER AN HOUR WITHOUT FOOD AND THE WAITER COMPLETELY AVOIDED COMING IN OUR DIRECTION TO EVEN GIVE US AN UPDATE. My husband flagged down the lady who seated us and asked to speak to a manager and she says it's because the system went down and apologized for the inconvenience. The manager came to speak to us and pretty much gave us the same story and just when we were about to get up and leave our waiter comes to tell us they are plating our food right now. 5 mins later our food comes out and to be honest it was not very good at all. I chose to come here because in Cali we have Roscoes and Lolos was the closes thing to that but the food was honestly horrible. We walked away with plates still full and for our inconvenience our drinks were comped and we were given a 10% discount lol. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here at about 1:30pm on a Monday. There were lots of tables and booths available in the main dining room and in the bar. The hostess (older lady) refused to seat us in a booth, even though several were empty in different sections of the restaurant. My back hurts, so I wanted a booth, but apparently that was too much to ask for. She said she couldn't seat us in a booth because they were all dirty (they weren't). She was on a power trip. So we left and went across the street to Famous Dave's, where their hostess was happy to seat us- imagine that!"}
{"text":"Visited this Vegas location and was impressed with the food. 
First of all they get a plus for serving my favorite beer ... Angry Orchard.
I ordered the waffle with a breast and a side a grits. The waffle was just ok and so were the grits. At first when I saw other plates coming out, I thought the chicken looked like it was going to be fried too hard for my liking but to my surprise the looks were deceiving. The chicken was seasoned well and tasted like something I would eat at home. 
The service was a little too slow for me; however the servers were nice and professional about it. 
Overall I would definitely return here again. This place is giving Roscoe's a run for their money so if they ever come to LA, I'll support it."}
{"text":"YUK!! Very disappointed and pricey. Great service but the chicken was flavorless. My plate was $17, chicken, waffles, eggs and grits. $2 extra for white me.  I was previously advised not to go because the food was gross. Well, the chicken is not gross, but definitely not good AT ALL. I guess they seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper. I will not be returning. I should have went to The Farm in Aliante Casino."}
{"text":"One of the older reviews had it correct. This place doesnt seem ready yet. Or they just have horrible customer service and communication between the employees.
     There were 3 people standing behind the hostess desk and I had to say excuse me several times before I was acknowledged. The wait to be seated was long. This is understandable as its a new place and getting lots of attention. The wait to order was long. The wait to get your food was long. One person at our table never got the eggs that came with their dish and another had to wait 15-20 min longer than the rest for their food (which was only a waffle and an egg). The meal doesn't all come out at the same time which is weird. A different server brought plates to our table three different times that were not ours. It also seemed like it may have been our servers first day ever on the job as they were very back and forth, and unsure of what we ordered. Maybe this was partly the cause of the bad experience.
     The waffles were good,  the chicken that came in the omelet was not so good I'll spare the details. So bad service and not great food. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok you know when you go somewhere by yourself, and you feel like you get ignored because you are a party of one?  I get that once in a while when dining out, and it is very frustrating.  I actually think this was a combo of that plus something seemed to be wrong with the waiter.  Not sure what it was, but he seemed out of it, confused, new, distracted.  Take your pick.

It was a Saturday night around 7pm, and I stopped in for some fried chicken and a waffle.  I have eaten at the Scottsdale location several times a few years ago and always enjoyed it.  They seated me at kinda a crappy table for two.  I asked to move to a booth.  It was not that busy, so I figured why do I have to sit at the crappy table just because I'm alone?

Waiter came over after what seemed like a longer time than necessary, and did one of those sit down with me on the booth.  Ugh!  I do not like that.  It just feels so invasive to me.  He's like trying to be my best buddy, and I'm not in the mood for all that drama, just take my order.  He's all, \"so what are you doing tonight?\"  Trying to eat in peace.  I feel like my body language gives off the vibe sometimes that I do not want to be bothered.  Let's keep is short and sweet, do not sit next to me.  He was not picking up my vibe.  I order water to drink and the Tre Tre.

He disappeared!  It took 13 minutes for someone else to walk by and notice my now pissed off vibe.  I still had no water.  That is ridiculous!  They were not busy!
The other waitress got my water, and the couple next to me said that they had also been waiting a long time for things.  A party in a booth in another section who arrived after me had their drinks right away.  

I tell the waitress that I am done, and I would like my food to go.  I also want my bill.  I just want out of there.

Waiter finally comes by with a ton of apologies, and my check, but he leaves quickly.  I get out my card to pay, and he has disappeared.  I'm still waiting.  I finally get up and go to the front and say I'm done I want to pay.  The hostess says you have to pay your server.  I say well my server is no where to be found and I am ready to go.  

They charge my card and give me my food to go.  The fried chicken was not even as good as I remember it.  Overall very diappointing.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"This place really sucks when it comes to service.  The waitresses are stupid and has no common sense.  We waited 49 mins for our food and it was room temperature by the time it was serve. They charge $3 for coffee and the waitress doesn't want to refill your coffee.  I'll find another place.  The service really is the worst.  I wish there was a negative star"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Lolo's tonight and our waiter was Lorenzo and he was awesome!!! He was so enthusiastic and on top of things!!! Great service , great food!!!"}
{"text":"Order through doordash. Unfortunately the orders all came incorrect. The fries were all missing and when I called the restaurant was told by the manager that oops it just came from doordash incorrectly so there was no offer to make anything right and unfortunately I don't know that I'll be ordering anything from Lolo's anymore.  Also some of the special requests were missing. And the burgers were all over cooked so all in all a very bad experience..  in addition, the hamburger buns were stale and falling apart. The chicken was also overcooked. It was almost nothing good to say about any of this food."}
{"text":"Theyve got great food. The only issue I have is the inconsistency with their portions."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place! Food was spectacular chicken & greens are my favorite. Christina the server was awesome."}
{"text":"Service.
Definitely needs improvement.  We waited over 30 minutes for our food to come, so we definitely needed some refills on drinks during that wait. The waitress barely checked on us for refills or to see if we needed anything.  However, when we were almost done eating... she kept coming back every couple of minutes to grab each single plate as it was clear ... All of a sudden all the attention we need from our server, but I knew it was only because we were finishing up and they just needed a table.   

Food.  
Just come for the chicken !!! 
The only thing my family and I really enjoyed was the chicken.  Super crispy and just the right amount of batter.   The waffles were ok, (I don't think anything can compare to Roscoe's chicken and waffles let's be honest).  Mac and cheese was ok and the cornbread was a little too dry for me.   Also, DO NOT get the red velvet pancakes, they were super dry and not worth it. 

TIP:  Be prepared to wait.  Since they just opened it is super busy.  Especially on the weekends, over 45 minute wait.  

This location is not on my side of town, but I would come back definitely for the chicken and I would come probably on a weekday for now.  Perhaps after some time, the service would improve too!"}
{"text":"I didn't mind waiting 45 minutes for a table, and I didn't mind waiting almost an hour for our food...even with two small, hungry kids... but what I did mind was getting really dry chicken, cold waffles and this disgusting Mac-n-cheeses!!! It was inedible. If you going to charge high prices for food it should look and taste a lot better than this!"}
{"text":"Drove here 30 minutes from where we were staying, (in from so cal) JUST to try this place. Would like to have actually tried the chicken n waffles, however after waiting an hour, we were told they are out of silverware and could not seat us!
What?!!"}
{"text":"We went to lolo's today. And to be honest the previous reviews were kinda offsetting. 
We went anyways. I had been to the Scottsdale one a long time ago. So I figured it's new. We went around 11;15. We were seated right away. (3 of us. Me and 2 of my girlfriends.  We then got our menus and started looking them over. Our server came by said hi I'll be right with you. His name is Travis ( remember his name he is great ! ). He helped us out with questions.  And was very patient and kind and funny too! We got our food fairly quick for as busy as they were.  Travis kept checking on us keeping us updated.  The food was great! And GOOD :) it's still new there so be patient
 Go at an odd time. But it's a really good place to eat. Here are pictures of what we got"}
{"text":"I was craving some fried chicken and forgot this place was near from where I live. I told my bf lets stop by and get something to eat since I was hungry for some dank (good) fried chicken! We walked in and the host greeted with a smile. We told her a table would be okay. We didn't care for a booth since we were starving. We waited for a server for about 5 mins and asked us what we would like to drink. We only wanted water. Wasn't craving for kool aid because I remembered it was too sweet for me the last time I had it. She then comes back with 2 waters after 3 mins. Wetold her we still needed time to order. She gave us about 12 mins. Bf ordered lolos which was 3 pieces if chicken and 2 golden waffles. I had lil amadi which was 2 pieces of chicken and a golden waffle. The food came to us about 30 mins. Kind of a long wait which was a little disappointing. It wasn't even busy. The chicken was nice crispy, juicy, and delicious. So my anger went away afterwards. On top of that our server was nice she checked on us a few times. I can see why this place has a lot of 1-3 stars due to the wait time on food. I could understand if it was crazy busy but not on a slow day. I'm just glad the food was great for what its worth waiting."}
{"text":"Let's just say, they lost a ton of customers. Party of 10 dissatisfied. They sat us in the sun and after we realized it would be too intense, we asked how long it would be to go inside and they told us we have to go to the back of line and wait an hour! Seriously? That was the first flag. 
Then we sat without enough silver ware, plates to share our appetizers, or straws for the large mason jars. Second flag. 
The chicken with the waffles was overcooked. Grits were tasteless. They up charged for the kids apple juice, which is ridiculous. 
Service was horribly slow. I never received a refill for water. Yet another flag. 
Manager (Dina) lacks customer service skills. She made it seem like it was our fault for our displeasure despite it clearly being her staff's incompetencies. We saw two sets of empty tables in the shade, but they refused to let us move. And then we saw another party shift there after 20 minutes. She also said \"I'll get you fresh ice water to go\"... as if that was even a compensation. AND then, she didn't even bring us water. 

Parts we liked: waffles were thin and crispy, corn fritters were delicious as were the fried green beans."}
{"text":"Got in, it was a line for the hostess. I was surprised because there was plenty of room to seat people.. But I sat at the bar so I went right in, sat down, had a lemonade. Asked for an alcoholic beverage, was told they r waiting for their liquor license. Food was good, I ordered the salmon croquettes (something new to try) & had  sunny side eggs on top was pretty tasty but not a big fan of croquettes so won't b ordering that anymore. Looking forward to going back and trying everything else & the drinks they r plan on having. Still a new place, definetly has a lot of potential"}
{"text":"We ate at Lo-Lo's today and had an excellent experience! We ordered Pineapple Upside Down pancakes to share along with our eggs, meat and grits. While we were waiting for our food, the manager came out and apologized, saying the griddle stopped working and they would not be able to make our pancakes. We asked if he could make the recipe into waffles! He said YES and that our other food would come out while the waffles were being made. And he said the waffles would be no charge due to the inconvenience! The manager made the waffles as we requested and served them himself to us! AND the Pineapple Upside Down waffles were scrumptious!!!! The manager came back out to see if we liked them and we told him he should make that a menu item! In addition, the service was excellent and everyone was very friendly and courteous. This dining experience was truly pleasurable for this senior couple. Our thanks to Lo-Lo's! We truly appreciated our time with you today!"}
{"text":"Well let me start off by saying this... They have work to do. A great place like this will be ruined if management doesn't step in quick..  Got there at 730 just got home it's now after 10pm. 

The hostess station is completely clueless!! They told us an hour wait. We were willing to wait but oddly I could see multiple tables in the bar area and patio that had available seating. That was not offered. When I asked about them seats I was told I'd have to wait because their were many people ahead of us... 15 minutes later seats still open smh waitress walks up and says wanna sit with me.. so she just sat us :) cool
But from there we waited well over an hour before we got our food. I watched multiple parties so frustrated over the wait they just left.. 
When our food did arrive it was tasty but I think we will wait a few months before returning.. That place needs some serious help. I'd probably rerate in a few months.  So this review is more or less a warning at this point. The waitresses are under stress the kitchens way behind and the hostess station has no idea about what's avail on their floor.. Fingers crossed they find some experienced managers. QUICK"}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation and we're highly diasappointed. After waiting a little bit long for the appetizer, we waited another 45 minutes for our entrées before finally asking what the issue was.  Five minutes later a manager approached us and said \"sorry we're waiting for fresh chicken breasts\" this was after watching two tables come in after us and get their food before us. 10 minutes later our food arrived. I will say the waffles were pretty good but the chicken was extremely dry. Maybe one edible bite out of a thigh. The \"over hard\" eggs were more like dry scrambled eggs with melted cheese over top. The manager came up and just said \"I'm taking 15% off for your troubles.\" Once you wait an hour between appetizer and dinner 15% doesn't make much  of a difference. I was looking forward to trying this place and I can assure I will never be back. Our waitress was basically nonexistent throughout the entire ordeal. We actually did have one server notice how long we were waiting and approached us to apologize and said he wished he was serving us. It's sad when there was more recognition from a different server than ours and the manager."}
{"text":"A second visit to Lo-Lo's was as good as our first visit. Call for reservations! This place is deservedly busy because the taste of New Orleans is awesome and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"So the service was great our server Rosa was awesome the kool-aid was good and my children's meals were tasty. However the flavorless chicken and fish uhhhhhhhhhhhh  no thank you. For the amount that it came to i would have went to Popeyes and Mario's and would have better flavors then this. My banana pancakes were eh ok but the banana fosters from ihop are better. The seasoned glory greens were just that greens that came out the can. This restaurant has not been open that long and honestly I don't feel like it will be open that much more longer based on the flavor of the food. If it was just off service yes but this will be my first and last time visiting Lo-los  in Las Vegas. 
Just the service is why this place gets a 3
 Food gets a 2"}
{"text":"Reluctantly my family and best friend and her family came here for Mother's Day! This has got to be the worst food that I have ever tasted. The  chicken had so much salt that my best friend almost had a sodium attack and she's pregnant. The grits were awful, the waffle was nasty, but I was hungry after waiting so long to order and get our food, so I had to eat it. The service, well we won't go into that. Tony who I assume is a manger, did her best to make up for the mishaps. And she says this man owns several of these generic version of Roscoe's! And is opening one in Texas! Please do yourself a favor and do not open anymore. I can't even express in the right words how disappointed I am. The peach cobbler is sour and tastes fake! I was so mad when I got home and was excited to try it, but to my avail, it was horrible, just like everything else. Never again. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. I think I might open a restaurant here and cook some real soul food!"}
{"text":"Would rate a zero if I could. Horrible service, waited so long for my waitress to come back and take our order. I had to repeatedly call other waiters to help us. 
Very disappointed with this location. I will not be going back"}
{"text":"Delicious food, super friendly wait staff and really nice atmosphere. Plenty of options and sides too!"}
{"text":"Slow food service, my daughter and I finished our food before my wife and sons food arrived. The grill was not working and we were not told this until after we ordered our food. This drive us to change our order and at that point we should have just left and came back another day. This was a let down as we have had better luck in the past."}
{"text":"This was the worse experience I've ever had in my life.  The wait was 15. -20 min. which we were okay with...after being seated and order was taken, it took well over 45 minutes to receive our food....it was only two of us...when asked to speak to a manager, she never came to our table.  Coincedently, my husband stopped someone, which just so happened to be a manager.

Our eggs, waffles and grits were cold.  The only thing that was good was the Chicken.

We will never ever patronize Lo-Lo's again....not even if it was free!"}
{"text":"Horrible. This place was extremely empty when we arrived and yet we had to request a server. My friend's waffle was nice and golden brown like a waffle should be. my Waffle was very light in color and soft. I bit into the waffle and I could taste batter. The waffle is undercooked. The waitress brought a new waffle but it looks and taste exactly the same. I show her what is batter . The waitress says,  if you want a waffle golden brown you need to order it well done otherwise it's going to come out soft. (I have no reason to lie on this lady) I said my friend did not order a well done waffle and why didn't the waitress asked me if I wanted a undercooked, slightly cooked, or well-done waffle? The waitress says your friend probably got someone else's waffle. She then brings me a well done  golden brown delicious waffle .  I order grits,eggs, and fried chicken too . The Grits were extremely watery and the chicken was  seriously overcooked. Most of the food was still on the table when she brought the bill. Waitress said I didn't charge you for the other two waffles. I told her I would not have paid for raw food. I gave two stars because my mojito and my friends Kool-Aid vodka cocktail were absolutely delicious. I did order a 2nd cocktail but it never made it to the table. I thought the prices were acceptable. There's ample parking, it's easy to find, and they have one hell of a bartender. I don't know his name but he was the only Caucasian man behind the counter. It's located pretty far off the strip so I'm sure I won't go back. My experience matches the name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is great!
The ladies that work here are very customer service friendly. The atmosphere is cool and they play a good mixture of music, that gives the place a relaxing vibe.
One of the owner's, Bubba is really nice too! I would recommend that you give this place a try."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed the Phoenix location for years. We just ate here and thought the food and service was just as good."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here because she has never had chicken and waffles and some of my coworkers said it was decent. Much to my surprise, i found the service was crazy slow, the food was greasy beyond all reason, the setting was just dirty... and to top it off our server brought our food and it had flies in it. Worst 90 minutes if my life. Not to mention those 90 minutes were spend seeing our server once. He even had other servers give us our food. Never going back. Ever."}
{"text":"Great greeting. Very friendly staff and seriously delicious food. 

I went on opening day so if they keep this up this restaurant will be a big success in the new dining Mecca that is downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"we took some friends here from out of town. One friend had the salmon croquettes - actually quite large and she said they were very good. The other friend had chicken and waffles - said both were very good. I got the chicken and fish - fried fish was quite delicious and so was the chicken. Sides are also very good.  Portions are quite large here - you'll come away stuffed. Service was very good. Yeah for sweet tea!!"}
{"text":"Lo-Lo's has a nice open area for tables and spacious booths. An excellent atmosphere and mood. The employees are attentive, upbeat and and on their game, especially Sparky. 

Lo-Lo's has Kool-Aid on tap and different combinations to make specialty KA drinks. 

I had the Baby Ray which was three pieces of chicken smothered in southern gravy and a side of some incredible waffles. The portions will ensure you're stuffed. 

Definitely recommend and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Georgia so I'd like to think I know a bit about southern food. I would call this fancy southern. It's a pretty good place if that's what your looking for. I've had one meal that was excellent and one that was ok that's why 4 Stars."}
{"text":"So my dad has been talking about this place for ages and we finally made it. It's a big place wonderful seating arrangements inside and out. It is in a  great location but the service is severely poor. We were greeted by a hottest who was very nice and cleared a booth for my dad and i. She later brought us waters and said our server will be right out . I decided to go on yelp to look at all the foods and we quickly got even more excited. We talked and decided what we wanted and waited. We waited over 20 mins before anyone even acknowledged we were there. We tried to stare, even flag down some servers but we're ignored. One server came over but then decided to talk to the booth next to us instead and not once did he reply with I'll be right with you, onw moment or anything . Very rude. We flagged another server who didn't want to talk to us. I felt it. We asked could we order please with someone. So we told him what we wanted and he returned with side plates which were dirty. I told my dad I'm sorry but with service like that I don't want to be here. It made me feel horrible. I have over 10 years experience in the industry.  I won't ever come back. I felt bad most for my dad."}
{"text":"I love Lolo's chicken, usually the food is good. But we literally waited 58 minutes for our food to come. The tables next to us on both sides also had complaints of not receiving their food on time. They kept forgetting to come back with the desired needs, as simple as ketchup! :("}
{"text":"*Customer Service 2/2 Stars, Very nice for the most part and very polite. 

*Experience 1/1 Star, Have been here multiple times when busy and when not busy at all. Nice building and location.

*Food 1/1 Star, Has to be the best chicken strips I've had in Arizona for sure!

*Would I Recommend 1/1 Star, do you love Chicken? Yes I recommend this place especially if you haven't tried before."}
{"text":"It was our family's first time here and it was the best! We ended our evening coming here and Steve and the head chef made our night! I'm so impressed with the wonderful services and food. Seriously, Steve and the head chef are awesome. I recommend asking for him. Just a great experience all around! We definitely will return for the food and to see steve! Thanks for the wonderful evening and being so welcoming when you were closing. Thank you"}
{"text":"So sad to see the bad reviews!  Food and service were excellent for my husband and me a couple of weeks ago. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I wish I could judge LoLo's off the quality of the food, since both me and my wife love chicken and waffles. Sadly after waiting 45mins just to have our waitress introduce herself to us we decided to walk out, mind you that was after the 30 minute wait to be seated. All while watching said waitress service the tables around us and seem to openly be ignoring as we tried to flag her down. Sorry to say this was such a disappointment I had to make a yelp account."}
{"text":"This food was bomb! Ate it all, and my stomach is full!!! Stuffed! Omg. I will be coming back, no doubt!"}
{"text":"We've been trying to get into this place to taste the food when it wasn't so busy and today was the day!  Yummy, chicken and waffles sounded so good!!!  Arrived about 1:09pm, waited until 1:17 to be seated (2nd booth from the front, left of bar).  Watched our server bring food, then condiments to both, booths 1 and 3, twice each, as we reviewed our menus and made all our selections....still waiting to even be acknowledged.  No smile, no hello, no kiss my a**, not even a look.  We walked out at 1:33.  I don't know how good the food is...and likely never will...but I do know the service is severely lacking."}
{"text":"It's good, real good! And if you haven't taken the time to get here yet, it's time you did! Super reasonable prices and ability to add to the experience by ordering from the \"sides & add on's\" menu. Staff is great too. Friendly and helpful. Long story short... #GetHere"}
{"text":"I walked in with my wife for breakfast for the first time and everyone seemed friendly until we got our server. He did not seem too friendly with me primarily, I do not know what i did to him or if i did anything at all. Maybe he was having a bad morning, or maybe because i asked for the ribeye and eggs. However, I do know for a fact that I did not do anything for this guy to treat me the way that he did. When we finally got our food about 20-30 minutes later due to having only one cook, (nice amount for the price btw), I did not get what I ordered. But that was not the problem. The problem was the lack of professional eye contact and attitude when i addressed the problem with my order. Again, i do not know what i did to make this dude continually upset with me, but he did not even look in my direction when he said he will let the manager know. So ge goes to the back and tells the cook or whoever he told, my wife was watching and said that him and who he told was laughing. For as long as he and the guy he was laughing with are still working there, I won't ever be back"}
{"text":"So I was hyped to come here. I read the less than stellar reviews but figured I like waffles, I like chicken (not my favorite protein but whatev) and the prices were extremely reasonable. I had told my fiancé all about this place, hyping it up, getting her excited for some chicken too so we came here for our date night. Driving up to Lo-lo's I spotted the big neon chicken sign, increasing my excitement andddd turns out, Lo-lo's is just so-so. Came here on a Saturday night around 8:30 or so, waited maybe 5 minutes so that was good. Probes are super reasonable and the portions are decent. My fiancé ordered the biscuits with sausage gravy that came with two eggs and home fries. The biscuits and gravy were really good, the biscuits were huge like a biscuit cake and had a nice crunchy outside. I didn't try the eggs but she said they were fine but the home fries were bland and unevenly cooked. They don't allow substitutions but I wish they had so she could have ordered fries instead. Plus that's super inconvenient since a lot of the orders come with grits and I hate grits. ANYWAY, I ordered the Toy Toy which was one waffle with two fried chicken wings and I added a side of mac and cheese. The mac was really good and the cheese sauce was really thick which I thought would throw me off but the flavor was great. But the chicken and the waffle were just okay. They honestly tasted like food my father makes at home so if that's what they're going for, home cooked food, then they nailed it otherwise it really wasn't anything special. I ordered a Lo-lo's punch which was I believe red kool-aid, red berry vodka, and pineapple juice. For $6 it was okay, really watered down but I wasn't trying to get hammered so it was alright. All in all, a decent meal but definitely not worth all the hype. I'm glad I tried it but I doubt I'd go back. I will say that I like the location of the restaurant because I'm just getting familiar with Arizona and in coming here, I found a whole bunch of other cool places to eat that I've already bookmarked."}
{"text":"I was super excited about this place! As soon as we walked in, I really started getting hungry because the place smells so good. After being seated,  not one person on the staff acknowledged us at all.  After waiting over 15 minutes,  we got up and left. We left before we could even taste the water! Seemed like it would have been a great place, to bad it's wait staff has a terrible attitude and/or poor leadership."}
{"text":"The idea of \"fried chicken with waffles\" had always sounded amazing to me, but for some reason, I have not been lucky to try this combo until now. My first experience is at Lo-Lo's, and I'm glad it was as awesome as how I imagined it would be! I got the LIL AMADI with one thigh and one drumstick...the perfect meal size me. Love the fluffy butter, the maple syrup, and the cranberry juice-in-a-jar to go with it! My only complaint is the waffle had a strong cinnamon flavor, which I could do without, but it did provide an interesting depth of warmth to the dish, associated with comfort food. I also appreciate that the waffle was soft and spongy to soak up the fried chicken grease, and the chicken was seasoned perfectly! This was also my first time dining in downtown Gilbert and was blown away by all the culinary hot spots in the area. But Lo-Lo's definitely has a spot in my heart now!"}
{"text":"Great fried chicken.   Lots of tasty sides, grits, okra, collard greens, green fried tomatoes.  Soul food in Summerlin?  Who knew?  Catfish, peach cobbler, cinnamon waffles, egg dishes, etc.  Service is good and ambiance is family friendly.  Come on in and drink the Kool Aid."}
{"text":"Lets see Spicy corn fritters, chicken smothered in gravy french fries two waffles and 2 chicken breast and the top it off fruit punch Kool-Aid excellent"}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice and catering. However the greens was mushy as if it had been re-warmed to many times. The chicken was very bland and lacked seasoning. The Mac n cheese pic you see on menu and the one you get is two different things . It tasted like they used velveeta nacho cheese on it. I was expecting oven baked Mac due to pic advertised on menu. Maybe they was lazy that day.The catfish was the best thing on the menu but nothing to drive out your way for. I'd rather go to grits cafe. However if your looking for a good drink they do make great cocktails . This place is over rated and lacked season and real southern passion behind the food."}
{"text":"Honestly, ive been sort of avoiding this place as the reviews are very mixed, although I must say we had a nice experience!  Service staff was very engaging and genuinely very nice.  I had chicken and waffles, which was very moist and well seasoned.  I will go back!!!"}
{"text":"I recently ate here and to be honest the food was not great it was good when it 1st opened but not to my liking any more"}
{"text":"The food at Lolo's was good, and if reviews and visits were based on food alone I would definitely return. But my rating on this location in particular is not based on the quality of their food. This was my family's first visit and we were very excited to try this new restaurant. We became very frustrated with this visit. We arrived with a group of 8 there was no one waiting to be seated, the hostess told us that there would be a 15 minute wait worst case scenario 30 minute wait. The adults decided to order drinks at the bar, the lone bartender attending an empty bar took 15 minutes to procure 4 drinks. We then notice that not only this employee was working the bar but serving tables as well! After 20 minutes of waiting the hostess advised the wait would only be 5 minutes longer. After an additional 10 minutes another hostess taps a guest in my party on the back of her arm let's her know that there's only 5 more minutes to wait. After another 10 minutes the hostesses advise us that the reason why we aren't seated is because an existing party \"won't leave and are just talking\". Blaming patrons for new guests not being seated is unprofessional. Our total wait was 45 min to be seated 12 minutes for sodas and another 30 minutes for our food to arrive at the table. The restaurant in itself did not lack in employees but the organization of duties seemed to be lacking."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we went for the Free Fried Chicken Friday Event. What a great way to bring us in to try some delicious fried chicken!! From the beginning, the host was nice and greeted us with a smile. Once we got seated, our waiter came to take our order and introduced the promotion. We were pleased with his great humor and energy while talking to us. We got the chicken and waffle and chicken with Mac and Cheese. Ohhhhh my goodness!!!! The seasoning on the chicken was spot on amazing! The salty seasoning with the sweet warm syrup and waffle couldn't be anymore perfect. It's a must have together! The Mac N Cheese was creamy and flavorful. I loved it!! We ordered a side of rice & gravy + fried okra. The fried okra was perfectly fried. Not greasy at all and perfect amount of breading!! The manager went around to greet all of us. I love the energy and the friendly environment. Can't wait to bring people here with us next time. Hope this post helped! Cheers to FRIED FRIDAYS!!!"}
{"text":"Service was super bad only saw the waitress once, that  was to take our order. We had no utensils had to get up and ask  for them and they took their time bringing them out mean while our food got cold. My sister chicken was burnt Waffle was soggy and cold. This is my third and last time coming been disappointed every time LoLo is a no no. Will not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Well, you always want to give a place a chance, but after about my 4th or 5th time of eating here and the service was horrendous.  We arrived, 30-45 minute wait and there were gobs of tables/booths empty.  Got seated at a table, but had ask for a booth and were told about another 20 min wait...ugh, we stayed at the table, but the chairs they have are solid metal seats and hard as a rock..(consider changing), so requested a booth, they told us since we had already placed our order they couldn't move us.....WHAT....was act of congress, requested Manager, finally got moved to a booth and we waited about an hour & 20 minutes for our food, saw tables get up and leave because they hadn't been served.  Our meal was all messed up, didn't get certain items.....I said ok....Give me the manager.  Dawn came to our table and we both just let her have it and she did apologize profusely and comped our meal   She expressed that it was her 3rd day as the new manager and that they are looking for all positions in the restaurant.....LAS VEGAS, if you need a job and you work in the food industry, they are hiring.  Not sure we will return, but do hope they get it together."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the worst to begin with when the hostess sat us asked what we wanted to drink said water to begin with and never saw him again! About 10 minutes later a server don't know his name came to the table didn't introduce himself asked if someone got our drinks we said not sure host asked  but never brought them said what do you want to order to eat said I'm not sure yet and walked away with attitude and eye rolling! Came back eventually with the water and  I asked if I could order a lemonade since it was homemade and he walked a way abruptly again with attitude like I was putting him out!  By this point I was done with the putting him out attitude and went to the bartender to ask if a manager could be sent to the table debating if we should just leave and go to m&m soul food which there service and food blows this place out of the water! In the meantime a different food server came to try to get our food order but really hadn't decided to stay or go yet and then the manager eventually shows up
With lots of excuses like her server the one with the attitude acting like anything I asked or said without putting him out with his rolling eyes and walking away that he must have been upset because he didn't really want to be there and he was working later than he was supposed to my response was then cut them from the floor it's bad for your business for a customer not to feel welcome in an establishment that you have  been sitting in
 for approximately a half hour is unacceptable in my book... in the meantime after her making tons of excuses and what not she offered to bring some fried green tomatoes to the table and switched servers still felt quite uncomfortable in there this was approximately 6 o'clock on a Sunday night and I guess supposedly they close at 6 o'clock according to the manager said one of the hostesses just sent a customer away saying that we close in 10 minutes we also heard another server at a table behind us tell customers they couldn't order anything to go which I thought again with strange since food was still coming out the impression is very lazy service in there and you are constantly having to flag people down to try to get their attention when they come to the table they come off as if there you're doing you a favor or that you're just simply putting them out! The food took a long time to come out when it was brought to the table one of the chicken breast we noticed looked like it was very old and dry and it was totally different from the other pieces and sure enough after cutting into it was exactly what we thought dry and like it had been sitting there all day under a heat lamp asked if they would remake that piece of chicken again got attitude and was told it would take 5 to 8 minutes.... well it literally took them
 a half an hour! Lastly at 6 o'clock you can hear the entire kitchen staff so loud you could hear per Batum their conversations as they act like they're having a party one talking louder than the next while we were sitting very far from the kitchen Side of the restaurant actually and yet that's all you could hear the employees acting as if they didn't have any cares in the world it  very disrespectful and very unpleasant to listen to.... followed up by blaring loud music again so that the employees can have a great time still four or five tables in the restaurant and they're blasting people out it was so uncomfortable I had asked for them to turn the music down as it was giving me a headache!!! My recommendation is avoid this place like the plague the food is nothing to write home about and the service is ridiculous these people act like they're beneath serving anybody shame on them and coming from being a former food server  I certainly wasn't working for the minimum wage I was getting paid for they need customer service skills taught  to them badly and management The general manager actually seem to be intimidated by the workers and out of control of the entire restaurant all she did was make excuses one after the other!!! Go to m&m soul  food you will not be disappointed they originated in East LA they are as nice as pie when you come in and can't do enough to give you good service and great food with a smile on their face"}
{"text":"Avoid!!!  My husband and I have eaten here 3 times.  I'd read the bad reviews but gave them the benefit of the doubt because they were new.  Here are the highlights, why we went 3 times and why we will never go back.

First visit, we were seated inside and was what I would consider the off time between late lunch and early dinner.  We ordered chicken and waffles.  Both were good we were happy.  We have never had that combo before but walked away thinking \"weird but tasty\".  We had eyeballed some of their breakfast options and new we needed to come back and try them.  We did have one negative thing during our visit worth a mention.  The waitress next to the table by us used our table to hold her try while handing out drinks and was swearing in conversation with the other table.  No excuse me or do you mind.  We aren't offended by swearing but was amazed to hear it in that scenario.

Visit 2, we ordered breakfast.  We had the stuffed French toast and some delicious sounding pancakes.  I can't remember which.  Stuffed French toast... Gross.  Hard, like the baguette was microwaved or something, dry and basically inedible.  Other pancakes were good but I can't even remember what we had ordered.  Service was good.

Visit 3, I really wanted to try their pineapple upside down pancakes.  My husband ordered a sandwich or something.  Food came.  Husbands was \"edible but not delicious\". My pancakes were literally in crumbles.  I took a picture, I need to see if I can find it to post.  The sauce that was supposed to be served on top of the pancakes was \"too frozen to put on top so it's in the cup on your plate\".  I was horrified.  I took a couple of bites pancakes they were some how dry but not fully cooked at the same time.  Gross.  Pancakes were sent back.  No replacements brought out no credit on our bill.  We paid, we left, we will never go back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and was sorely disappointed.  We walked in and stood there waiting for over 10 minutes to be seated.  The restaurant itself wasn't busy. When we were acknowledged we were rudely lead to our booth without an apology.  The waiter took our drink order and left us for 15 minutes to bring us our drinks and take our order.  When we received our food my daughters Mac and cheese was cold and the waffles were dry and tasteless.  Needless to say I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"On our way to Laughlin, and since we were going through Vegas I had to stop here.  One of my favorite places to eat.  The weather was beautiful, so we sat outside this time. Seats are comfy and tables roomy, fyi.

I ordered the Tre-Tre (waffle plus two fried chicken legs) and my husband ordered the Lil Amadi (waffle plus two fried chicken thighs). I also got a side of fried okra.  First off--the friend okra. It was pretty darn good, second only to my mom's. I prefer my friend okra sliced slightly thinner and a little more cornmeal to the batter. But it was still really, really good & I'd order it again.  The waffles were just as delicious as I remember...some magical batter with cinnamon and other spices combined with butter and syrup makes them SO good.  And the fried chicken is perfect...crisp and juicy, not too thick of batter.  

This time I tried their Lo-Lo's brand hot sauce and was surprised to find I really liked it.  I usually don't like the restaurant brand hot sauce because they're usually too smoky for my tastes.  This one was spicy and tangy, no smoke flavor. I'd actually consider buying it to take home if we weren't headed in the opposite direction! 

The water still comes in a Mason jar, which works great for me since I drink a lot. Waitress was fine. Nice smile and friendly.  Gave us the right amount of time between drinks and ordering to look over the menu.

Can't wait to come back in May!!"}
{"text":"Best soul food place I've been too so far in Vegas. Will definitely be back, everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Tried this place on two occasions. Still waiting on the liquor license is what the staff continues to say. Fried chicken is pretty good. Sadly the waffles are dense and not very good. They come two ways soggy or hard as a rock. Catfish batter is too thick. Greens are delicious! Corn bread is iffy once I got one that was still wet in the middle with while corn kernels inside, another time it was perfectly cooked! Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Good service. Had three fingers and waffles. Plenty to share. Fingers were thick, juicy, and crunchy."}
{"text":"Staff immediately made me and my friends unwelcome, and said \"we cant guarantee you a seat\" Learn customer service!"}
{"text":"sorry to all the 5star reviewers but this place does not deserve not even 1 star. went in with my gf around 11am. my gf ordered of course the chicken and waffles and i ordered their supposed big breakfast sandwhich. and let me say the big breakfast sandwhich is shitty. its only 2 peices of toast 2 scrambled eggs and 2 peices of bacon and nothing else such a ripoff for $5. i could have easily made it at home for less than that. and the chicken and waffles were horrible. the chicken tasted like it was fried in a 2week old dirty burnt oil. and thats what the chicken tasted like burnt nasty old oil. this place totally sucked ass and nothing else the watermelon drinks we ordered was like they dumped a whole bag of sugar in 2 servings of koolaid we got sweet as hell we needed 2 waters to dilute it and it still wasn't enough  to dilute the sugar out of those drinks still extremely sweet. and yea this place really sucked. never going back."}
{"text":"So.....from the beginning we think it was going to be a nice experience. We walk in and mind you we are the only people at the host stand. The hostess whose name I did not get looks at us as another couple come in and decides she is going to seat them first. So I made a comment such as \"I guess we are just standing here for no reason.\" She heard this and stupidly asked \"oh were you here first?\" I shook my head sarcastically and said \"yeh\" since moving to Arizona We have never felt any negative judgement/prejudice. This incident made me feel that because of my Mexican color, that I was secondary to the more pale of skin tone. However, through this negative beginning, our waiter Josh was gentle, warm, informative and friendly. The food is definitely better at this location when it comes to flavor and the size of the chicken. I would definitely recommend this place and to have your voice heard when others don't have the common decency to let the hostess know that someone else was here first. Thanks again Josh for making the second half of this experience a good one."}
{"text":"Only giving this 2 stars because of prior experience here was amazing and the waitress we had was awesome otherwise it doesn't deserve any. Visited 2-23-17 on a not so busy Thursday night. Arrived at 5:15 to have dinner. Ordered an appetizer and drinks. Koolaid was perfect, drinks perfect. The problem you ask? Getting our food was horrendous!!! After placing our 3 entree orders we didn't see it for 45 mins. Told the waitress it was cold( butter wasn't even melting on the waffle!) and to have it sent back. Only got 2 entrees and didn't see the third one. Appetizer still hasn't come out before our dinner showed up cold. The waitress we had was amazing and said she would take care of it. Grabbed our meals with the manager standing right behind her not even apologizing or showing concern. Just glanced our way and bolted the other direction! Told the waitress we still haven't gotten our app yet. 5 mins later appetizer comes out piping hot and yummy. 15 mins roll by and we get our 2 entrees, still COLDER THAN YOUR EXS HEART for the second time. Mind you we still haven't even seen the third entree. The place wasn't busy as much as they usually are and still super cold food. My first visit here was amazing but it was jam packed, crowded but they still got our drinks, appetizer and entrees for a table of 8 in about 20-30 mins. We asked to speak with the manager and to our surprise gave us a \"what the hell do you want me to do about it\" kind of attitude. The waitress, that was yelling at her staff to get theirselves together, had more \"managing\" experience/attitude than that person who had a red manager shirt. WAITRESS WAS VERY UNDER-APPRECIATED! I wish I could of caught her name. Willing to try this place again and hopefully we can have piping hot chicken and waffles this time!"}
{"text":"This place was all hype. I didn't mind the long wait, since I knew it was to be expected. Once seated it took awhile for anyone to come by, which I let slide again because it was busy. 

Once we ordered and received food the chicken was bland and the waffle was soggy mush. Not sure what all the hulabaloo was about but it definitely bot high on my list. Maybe it would be better to come at a slower time when perhaps there will be better quality."}
{"text":"My expectations were very high due to all they hype around this Phoenix Area soul food legend.

I got the #3 Lo-Lo and was not impressed.
Quality was not there for the price.

The chicken was greasy and my stomach told me never to eat that again... Ugh!
I can make better waffles at home.  Sad :-(

Service was good, so I gave it 2-stars instead of 1"}
{"text":"My girlfriend wanted to try this place and after reading the Yelp reviews I was a little skeptical but I'm glad we did!  It was a busy Sunday right around noon so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. After being seated we were promptly greeted by our waitress and had drinks within a couple minutes. After ordering, our food was brought out relatively quick and was all delicious. Once we were finished a gentleman came over and asked how everything was and asked if we would provide feedback on Yelp. I assume they are trying to repair the tainted image they currently have on Yelp and they are certainly on the right track. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The first two times we went to the Gilbert location, my family and I were taken care of moderately well by Kyle.  The next time, we asked specifically for Kyle.  He was not there so we were told we would be seated soon enough. While we were waiting three, yes three, other couples walked in and were seated immediately. All three of those couples were black (we aren't, as I'm sure you can imagine with the need for distinction). 
I sought out the host to see when we would be seated (as there were STILL several tables open) and he said \"soon\".  Roughly 30 minutes later we were seated. 
Within 15 minutes, a slew of black waitstaff passed back and forth and back and forth whilst we sat waiting to even order a drink. Eventually, the only white waitstaff, a rather rude girl indeed, approached and said \"what do you want to order\".  
After ordering, we spent about 90 minutes waiting, with nothing to do but observe and take in the atmosphere.  In this observation we noticed that all of the patrons of color were in and out in under an hour.  All of the white customers were left sitting around waiting to be served by the *really* bad waitress while the rest of the waitstaff hung out. 
We chocked that visit up to a coincidence.  So we gave them another chance the following week.  THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED!  
Because Lolo's is one of our favorite places to eat (and the Gilbert location is closest to us), we didn't want to give up, so we gave it one more last chance. 
On the last one, after a ridiculous wait we were sat next to a large party.  That party had barely the chance to sit down and there were two waitstaff waiting to take their drink order.  In the meantime, we sat and waited and waited some more.  In 20 minutes, a group of four was seated on the other side of us.  They ordered and received their drinks before our same attitude laden white waitress even bothered to ask us what we wanted to drink.  
Each table on either side of us (12 people to the two of us) were taken care of and in and out before our food (which wasn't even what we ordered) came out.   With the rude waitresses promise of fixing my husbands order, we shared my food while he waited for his own.  ANOTHER HOUR LATER, well after we were both done eating off of my plate, my husbands food came.  
With no apology or offer to comp my husbands food that he was too pissed to eat, we paid the entire $55 bill and left.   
A word to the wise Lolo's: racism works both ways and if you're going to permit it within your company, at least make a point to practice discretion!  For f**ks sake, man!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  I've had the banana pancakes along with the chicken and waffles.
Service has been quick - food is great, one of my favorite places in gilbert for breakfast"}
{"text":"Have been waiting for a place that serves Real Southern Food! I found it! LoLo's! Kept on hearing about friends talking about comfort food and Southern Style Food and LoLo's? Well, we finally tried LoLo's. But for delivery only. Looked at their website and was very easy to access the different areas of the menu.  The names of the dishes are adorable and so we ordered 2 breasts and waffles, 2 chicken wings with waffles and 1 thigh and 1 leg with waffles. Also, 1 order of rice n gravy and 1 order of French fries n gravy. The website menu does not have $'s and I understand because of the cost of chicken especially breasts and wings so that really didn't bother me but when we picked up our food, the Hostess was very nice. I asked that I am picking up a delivery and this was our first time trying LoLo's. She said, \"You will Love LoLo's if you Love chicken and Southern food. Very nice, our hostess, gave us all the condiments that we needed for the dishes . And, she said I know you will be back but sometime dine in, ok? I said, ok. Well, when we got home and put everything on the table, it looked liked we were at the restaurant. The fried chicken was just as crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside as was the wings which were very nice size and the leg n thigh also were very good! The rice n gravy was good especially the gravy! Love that gravy! The French fries were steak fries and a order of gravy and was delicious also!  We will be going back to LoLo's and the Hostess was right that we would be back! But this time, will be dining in and getting the whole experience of LoLo's! Thank you to the Hostess that really did a Great Job!"}
{"text":"Love me some chicken and waffles. We had the #9) leg  theigh and waffle and the #10) two legs and waffle. Both $7 each so a good value here. Excellent hot crispy chicken, not a drop of grease, tender and juicy on the inside. Waffles are of course southern not fluffy Belgian style. I like to add a little bit of hot sauce which gives it all a good kick in combination with the sweetness of the  maple syrup. Now looking over the menu there are some great value items here and not on others. Its a bit confusing as you look at the combinations of items wondering how they came up with prices based on them, so spend some extra time looking over the menu. Portions are generous and I left feeling full and satisfied without breaking the bank. Lo Lo's is a perfect addition to the area."}
{"text":"Great food good service I love this place . The portions are very generous . Prices are great ."}
{"text":"First i would like to say that they food was OK, waffles and chicken were great ... However my husband got a burger and added fries (they didnt say there was an extra charge) i assumed it came with fries because they usually do.. the burger was 12$ and fries 2$ more... whatever, we found out after we got the receipt ... I got the Chicken fried steak dinner and it was ok, WAY TO SALTY for me... i ate a quarter of the portion, the mac n cheese was average Boxed mac n cheese... the Collard greens were good but again too salty... the cornbread was on point! delicous... We had the fried green tomatoes as and those were good... the thousand island was ok... OH i got MelonMojio and it was HORRIBLE all sugar and not good :/ i didnt finish it either... The husband got the Lo-Lo's Beer and it was warm... they came around and filled it up w/o asking and was charged again.. very understandable but they shouldve asked... the second time around the beer was a lil colder... we showed up at 5:30 and it wasnt that packed... we didnt leave til 7:30... the server guy was cool but the wait time took waaaaaaaay to long... i had my 2 kids and they were hungry... i couldve went home and cooked faster but we wanted to give this place a try... at the end of our meal we got the bill and the guy gave me the wrong bill... so i asked for mine and it was 76$ that to me was just a lil too much for not so great food and especially waiting... my kids got chicken n waffles and they loved it.. i would just only get chicken and waffles from this place... nothing else... maybe water too... but yea... this is just my POV :)"}
{"text":"Chicken- salty and plain, sat too long in oil. Cornbread- the opposite of sweet + dry. Mac and cheese one order cheesy and the other order was from the bottom of the pan dried and crusty! YUM! 

1 Star for the spicy corn fritters. 

Went here when it opened. Now it's dead and food is garbage. Even if I got a gift card or was invited to go again I wouldn't come back it was that bad.

Think I'm being too critical? Go spend 40 bucks here and see if it was worth your dining experience."}
{"text":"This was a great choice for a late breakfast. The bar tender Shawn did a great job. He was friendly and he helped everyone in his section. He also got out food for people quick. The food was ready so fast. I had just took my first sip of water.  Waffle and chicken so good. This is a go to spot in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I have been here for 30mins and no order has been taking!!this  is not cool at all!! They claim there going to make sure the food rushed out what ever that means but we will see what happens next!

Update the food came out fast hot and was good they gave me 50% off and everything was ok!"}
{"text":"THEY HAVE PEACH COBBLER!!! It's fantastic and I love it!  The chicken and waffles is also awesome, super happy to have one close by now! Oh yeah, and SWEET TEA!!!"}
{"text":"I finally stopped by their Gilbert location yesterday on Halloween.  The place was super busy.  I guess everybody decided they wanted chicken and waffles while dressed in their Halloween costumes.  Even the staff was dressed up and it was great!  It's nice seeing people being festive.  Anyways, it took about 30 minutes to be seated and 20 mins for the food come out.  The wait honestly wasn't that bad but I can only imagine dining on a weekday would be faster.  Service was excellent as the hosts apologized profusely for the wait and made light conversation as did the servers.  They were always a happy and quick to get you anything you need.  We were even asked by the manager how things were going.  Very classy.

Still the same great taste on their fried chicken as their Phoenix location but the waffles aren't quite the same.  I love the crispness of the waffles in Phoenix.  The waffles in Gilbert are more soft, fluffy, and spongy.  I got the usual Betty's Boob [one chicken breast and one waffle] since I could never finish my small platter as is and I finally got to try fried gizzards for the first time ever!  Interesting stuff.  I should have stuck with the mac & cheese though.  All-in-all, the Gilbert's Lo-Lo's location delivers the same great taste but Phoenix Lo-Lo's has the better waffle.  I'd probably be back since it's a lot closer than the Phoenix location."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed this morning with Lo Lo's,   I went there this morning with my mouth ready for some good chicken and waffles to find that they don't open until 11am. Now what restaurant that serves breakfast open up that late. I want breakfast durning breakfast time and not lunch hours. This doesn't make any sense to me."}
{"text":"Being from LA, it's heart breaking not having a Roscoe's in Vegas. However, when I saw chicken & waffles, I knew I had to give this place a shot. Sunday afternoon seems pretty hectic. 25 min wait for 2 people, but my boyfriend and I found a place at the bar so we got to skip the wait. The bartenders were really friendly; pretty good service. Now food wise.. Here is where I compare the two. I ordered the #9: breast, leg and waffle. Also got a side of Mac &cheese. The chicken was crispy which I enjoyed, but a little on the salty side, in my opinion. The waffle was almost IDENTICAL to Roscoe's. It might have had cinnamon in it or something different, but overall it gave me the same satisfaction of a Roscoe's waffle. Yum! Mac & cheese was just okay. Definitely not Roscoe's, but it was decent. Their sweet tea is super yummy! On the sweeter side, but absolutely delicious! So this wasn't 'Scoes from back home, but it's the closest thing to it. I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in the mood for some chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Writing this before I even received my food because of the fact that I came on a slow night got sat right away, however waited 30 min for my drink order then another 30 min for my food order. Now it's been an hour and still no food. Everyone here looks like they are confused and standing around in groups talking or on their phone. Customer service is a big thing and seeing this great company so disorganized and all over the place and upsets me. From Arizona where they have a Lo lo's too and expect much more.

Plus, cannot drink to cool down cause they don't have their liquor license. 

Like ugh!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything on the menu is awesome. Dont go here on the weekends if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Today I finally had a chance to take the kids and I for breakfast. It was Sunday so I knew I'd be waiting, it was only like 15 minutes. I want to start by saying that Sparky was amazing and gave great service!!! I really enjoyed the waffles It was soft and cinnamon-y. The chicken was hot and juicy and definitely get a side of honey hot sauce ( it's xtra) Oreo pancakes were good and the bacon perfectly cooked. We also ordered chicken tenders and a waffle that too was good. They have extremely large drink portions (kool-Aid) on tap lol but that watermelon was so good! We ended with banana pudding it's $7 but serves like 4 people and comes in a mason jar. I never really had it let me say I KNOW IT WAS HOMEMADE so delicious. All in all a great breakfast spot and finally a something similar to my hometown fav Roscoes!"}
{"text":"Fries were cold and had been sitting for a wile, mac and cheese cold,Bottled beer worm and more. Will not be going back.servers and staff loud and disruptive with each other.                                  Butch, Chandler 02-12-2018, 5:00 to 5:45 pm. If you are impressed by this place you are easily impressed"}
{"text":"This was the BEST soul food place I have been to. The food and hospitality was ahhmazing.  We were greeted by Roman  & Kj who just showered us with greetings as if we were family.  All of the staff members worked together as a team following up with us that we never had to wave anyone down to ask for anything. They anticipated the need and filled it.  True customer service.  

The decor was a setting with comfortable booth seats table and chairs. There's also a bar with tvs all around making it a great place for a family gathering /sports bar. Rool up glass garage doors allows for easy access to outdoor seating.

The menu which includes Kool aid has something that will please everyone. We all ordered something different so we could taste a little bit of everything.  The chicken gizzard stole the show.  The catfish was so full of flavor providing a light fresh taste that you will never forget. The aroma of the fresh fried chicken was was so good your mouth immediately starts to water. 

This will definitely be a regular stop for us whenever we come to Arizona."}
{"text":"It was good but not the best I have it 4 starts because of the awesome staff being so friendly and nice. And good drinks. The Mac and cheese so not very good I was expecting some homemade cheesy stuff, but it tasted like Kraft box. Other than that the chicken and waffles are good but not the best I had."}
{"text":"This place is down-home cooking in a commercial atmosphere.  mac & cheese, sautéed mushroom, and cornbread. The service here is paramount.  If you come to Vegas you must stop at this place. Large group,couple, or medium group whatever."}
{"text":"OMG....The food was excellent as well as our server T.J., the music and the atmosphere. Our food came within 10 minutes and was very hot and seasoned perfectly. My friend had Shrimp and Grits, I had the Soul Food Platter with my choice of fried chicken(which tasted like my moms), smothered potatoes with onions and gravy, grits(cooked perfectly) and a gigantic corn bread muffin. If you live here or visiting, you have to go to Lo-Lo's for breakfast, lunch or dinner, you will not be disappointed. The entire staff was very friendly, courteous and attentive. We also had the opportunity to meet the head chef and general manager. If you want great food, this is the place to go. Exceptional portions had a great price. This place is definitely at the top of my list, good job!"}
{"text":"I loveeeee this place so much! Delicious food and the service, drinks and music are all amazingggg"}
{"text":"Service was brutal! We had a table of 6, and we didn't get our food for nearly an hour. Apparently an omelette is a \"specialty item\" which led to the delay. Who would have thought an omelette would be a specialty item for breakfast. It's going to be tough for LoLo's to remain competitive in Gilbert, where all of their competitors are better."}
{"text":"The food was great. I definitely can't take anything away from that. But the service sucked. We were seated fairly quickly, but our waitress didn't even realize we'd been seated in her section for 15 mins. and that was only because I asked another waitress to get our server for drinks. My daughters get there drinks and I didn't get mine till after my food was served. Not even a glass of water our server said she would get me. To top it all off, they took it upon themselves to serve my daughter waffles and wing instead of waffles and a breast because they ran low on breathe and had to cook more (8 more minutes to wait). My daughter was polite and said she would wait the 8 minutes and would watch out for her food. Hmmm. That didn't happen. Again she forgot about our table. It wasn't till the manager was walking around noticing myself and 1 daughter had food but weren't eating, and my other daughter had nothing did he go get her a fresh plate. We didn't even know he was the manager, he looked like the other waiters. Grant it they credited my daughter late plate, and some apologized for the poor service. But our waitress could have been sincere. She was too busy waiting on a larger party. Sucks for her cuz I tip based on service not just cuz it's the right thing to do. Maybe next time I'll just order food to go."}
{"text":"It was ok! I just wouldn't pay $3 for a cup of Kool aid when it's .25 cent a pack at the grocery store.  The service I received was really good. I like the waffles too."}
{"text":"Lo Lo is so good they koolaid and chicken and waffles and sides be so Good I love it and the drinks are bomb to I can't wait to have again"}
{"text":"While the food is good it took an hour for it to come.  Be prepared to take your time and don't be in a rush.  Had the fried chicken and waffles which were excellent and the mac and cheese is very cheesy.  Just can't get over how busy the restaurant is and food is so slow coming out the kitchen.

To be fair this is only the 2nd day this location has been open."}
{"text":"Not particularly busy but no one came to greet us. Had to ask for the manager to get a server.  Not usually the case at LV restaurants."}
{"text":"Well.. I've come here a couple times and all the others, the service was quick and awesome and everything came out in a timely manner. But this time, right after New Years, the place was EXTREMELY slow and understaffed.  Maybe three or four people working outside the kitchen and none were being very timely. We waited for about 15-20 minutes for a seat (seats were open but took forever to be cleared from previous guests), and then a full hour for our food. The food was great except for a salad, which was supposed to have avocados on it. First try, there's no avocados. Second try, the avocados are rotten. Third and final try, the waitress brought us a few not great slices and said \"Those are the best ones we got.\" So obviously at this point, we're pretty irritated but we have our food and we're not going to complain and cause a scene. We eat, it's great. Happy people. Then comes the bill. On the menu, it specifies which meals come with ranch or whatever. Some of us got those meals. Our waitress charged us a DOLLAR for each tiny cup of ranch, and we're talking about a cup that is in inch deep and an inch wide. She also brought us multiple refills of said ranch multiple times without our asking, so seeing that was definitely a surprise. At the end of the day.. I don't know if I'll be returning anytime soon. Truly do love the food, but this was NOT a pleasant experience at all."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place close to grab some grub and look what I found! I am thinking since I love both of them, I have to give it a shot right? Sat down in the bar area and really had a look at the place. The place is nice and the staff seemed friendly. Honestly, I didn't expect that. 

Now onto the C & W. The Waffles were pretty good and the chicken sucks. Ok, I'm done. Thank you so much for reading."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Good food. 

Came with my friend after seeing some photos on InstaGram. 
When we came in we noticed it was not as busy as other restaurants are on Sundays so we were hoping for quick service. 
Our waitress gave us time to look at the menu before ordering. We both ordered 3 piece chicken with macaroni and a waffle. 
Not once did our waitress or manager stop to check up on us. My friend would try to get any of the servers attention but no one stopped. 30 minutes later when he got a waitresses attention she said no before he asked a question. Then kept saying no interrupting him. 
5 minutes later our waitress comes to tell us that our orders are next on the screen! Let me remind you there were no lines out by the door and the restaurant was not as busy. 
After 40 minutes later and finally getting a refill the manager brings our food and all he says was \"sorry for the wait.\" And never came back to check on us. 
While eating the waitress only checked up on us once. 
Never coming back."}
{"text":"Every time I have visited this location, luckily it's not crowded/busy. The staff are very friendly. This time I ordered an alcoholic beverage \"Blue Ivy\", it was pretty good! 

For my meal I ordered the soul food platter. In my platter I ordered, one chicken breast, one salmon croquette, cornbread, greens and Mac and cheese. The chicken was pretty good. The greens were good as well very juicy. I did not like the Mac and cheese. It did not appear or taste like homemade Mac and cheese. The cheese seem runny or watery not like fresh cheddar. I ordered yams as well but they forgot to bring them out. 

One good thing is, the Prices are reasonable here."}
{"text":"Let's start with the water. How hard is it to get that right? The water here is obviously unfiltered and it is NASTY!"}
{"text":"It was very busy and the hostesses seemed to have a hard time managing the check in system. Hopefully the owners or managers help streamline that for them. After a while we were seated.  I wish they already had their liquor license because I probably would have ordered a drink while my hubby sat in the car with our kids because it was so packed. They said they were supposed to get their liquor license the following week.  Anyhow, it's great to have another option on the Northwest side of town. 

Update: A couple of weeks later, less busy but still no liquor license.  Chicken was better the first time too."}
{"text":"Excellent food, phenomenal service. Ron our server was very attentive, as were the other servers just walking by. Everyone was make no sure we were happy and needed nothing. And the fried chicken?  Right on point. How was this around the corner for years and I never tried it I'll never know. Now I'll be here monthly ."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst dining experiences I have encountered.  A family dinner turned into a nightmare.  Waffles were cold on all of our orders.  Chicken was piping hot' waffles had to wait maybe... My husband got his shrimp and grits 30 minutes after everyone else was plated.  Side orders of grits and eggs never arrived until halfway through our meals.  We asked the waitress so my times over 30 minutes for our side orders she began giving us an attitude.  The service was horrible.  I've gone to one in Arizona and had no issues.  It's really unfortunate, it has so much potential.  Maybe taking make time in training your staff would help, and an manager onsite."}
{"text":"I would love to leave positive review but just can't, the service and food quality recently has been quite challenging for this location, especially when having visited their Phoenix flagship location many times.

We ordered 2 Soul food platters, one with 3 drumsticks and the other 2 fish. They informed us they (the manager stated that they let staff go home since it wasn't busy and...) did not have enough drumsticks for the main order, so would deliver an assortment of chicken parts so we can eat as the fish platter was already ready to serve.

The initial food came out but the fish was way too salty, and upon asking the waiter to try some to confirm as something was quite wrong with it, he stated he was allergic to the fish but asked us if it was too salty as it appeared that typically unusually blackened fish was an indication of too much salt. We we're baffled why they would knowingly serve extra salty fish. 

They (the manager) brought out the other chicken drums and the extra fish fillets to go. Needless to say, this was not a good dining experience or food"}
{"text":"average. i was disappointed given all the great things i heard about LoLo's."}
{"text":"Can't understand the mediocre review for the Gilbert location facilities are amazing, food isn't exactly the same as Downtown location at all, but not that far off .Living in Gilbert I'm glad this location is here instead of driving to Phx 40 min away."}
{"text":"I've been to Lo-Lo's probably close to 5 or 6 times. It is usually pretty decent, but last night (1/3/2018) was very disappointing.

It was my son's 4th birthday, and he's recently started an obsession with fried chicken, or \"chicken-on-the-bone\" as he calls it. We thought what better place to take him than Lo-Los, right? 

We got there, Wednesday around 6PM, fairly empty. Probably the slowest I've seen it. The waitress immediately had no personality, and seemed bothered that we were even there. We ordered the fried green tomatoes, they were good, but really? $7.95 for 4 small tomato slices? That is robbery at it's finest.

Oh well, let's move on. I ordered a two drumstick & waffle plate for my son, 3-piece for me, and my wife got the mac&shrimp pasta. A few minutes later she came back and said they are out of legs. How can a chicken place be out of legs? Especially if it isn't even busy enough to warrant running out of food? Also, no apology or emotion from the waitress. Still seemed bothered we were in her section.

Ok, so we just had her bring thighs out. The food came, I notice that i have two thighs and a breast. The breast was so dark brown and dripping with grease that it looks like it was left in the fryer way longer than the other pieces. I could barely tear the meat with my teeth, so when i used a fork & knife, the chicken wasn't even glistening or anything, it was almost grayish and pale from being over cooked. I set the chicken aside, hoping that at some point, our waitress would come by and notice that piece was inedible. Nope, she could careless.

The only thing that tasted good that night was the shrimp inside my wife's mac&cheese. The mac itself was so dense that you had to drink after two bites otherwise it would lock up in your throat. 

By the time we left, after tip, it was $63.00. What a joke, and waste of money. I'm just glad that my 4 year old didn't understand the problems so he could enjoy his birthday dinner. 

I don't know if that means new management has taken over? Either way, I'll be thinking twice before returning. That's for sure."}
{"text":"45 mins for the wait , 45 mins and counting to get the food . Still waiting . Been to much busier places and have gotten food quicker . Asked for a drink 20 mins ago. Don't come here unless your going to want to wait forever . Jesus Christ"}
{"text":"I'd give it more stars if I could.  The overall experience was great from the moment we walked in and were greeted to the end of the meal.  We sat down and almost immediately our server Jamal came over. I think he was also a manager but I could be wrong.  This was our first time here and he began to recommend drinks and apps right away.  The fried green tomatoes were awesome.  I've had them at other places but  these are now my favorite.  I got the Sheeba's plate and that was some damn good chciken.  The wife got the stupid fries and I can't even begin to tell you how good they were.  The hot sauce...man what do I say about how good that was.  It made me sweat and my nose run but didn't burn my mouth so I could still taste the food.  I let Jamal know about how good I thought the hot sauce was and he explained that they normally sell it but that they were waiting on a new shipment.  Apparently the place they get it from had the the sauce but no label's so they were waiting on that.  Jamal then brought me a small to go cup and told me to load it up with the hot sauce.  Definitely looking forward to going back and trying out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I came here with high hope that they would have the most amazing out of the world fried chicken and side dishes. Unfortunately, I was wrong. 

I got a 3 pieces of chicken meal with a side of Yam and grilled onion/mushroom. The chicken was a bit overcooked, the yam was overly sweet and the mushrooms were literally undercooked. I honestly did not expect it at all and was disappointed. After speaking with few friends who love soul food, they felt that their food qualifies have gone down hill after they go big and started losing the quality they once have. 

I probably will not come here again."}
{"text":"I love meee some chicken & waffles! This restaurant is always clean and ambiance is nice. It takes awhile to get your food & I'd like to think it's because it cooked fresh. I've been here several times. It truly depends who your waiter is on your experience but generally it's a good one. They have really good kool-aid flavors! Love the Max & cheese!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place as I had heard mixed reviews. Not a good experience at all. The good came out cold and chicken breast were undone. The staff was very unprofessional from the hostess to the server. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ok lo los, ate here once before and food was excellent but service was bad so i marked it up as a one time bad experience......fast forward 2 weeks and i have my mom here from colorado....i take her here bragging aboit the food. We walk in and place is basically empty. Our hostess takes a few mimutes, no big deal, we sit doen with menus in hand. My mom is way impressed with the food selection as everything looks wonderful on the menu...takes us about 3 to5 min to pick our selection. We put the menus down and begin discussing day events.....5 min go by, then 10, then 15, then 18....at the 18th minute i have watched the full first quater of the golden st vs memphis game......my mom was like really this olace is empty...i immediately  see the problem, one server to handle the entire restaurant....its 530pm.....we get up and go to sweet tomatoes.....we were both very disappointed.....please dont let this place go out of business because you are trying to save on labor cost. You need to adequately staff your resraurant for predicted business flow....as in most of the complaints on here its all service related. You need to understand your profit margin/labor cost should have no equilibrium value....the employees didnt care neither did the manager on staff when we complained....please give me a call 7025749339, this is my business. Helping restaurants who have no idea what they are doing.....ill help train your staff so the service is top notch..and you wont run into inadequate bodies on the floor and still save labor cost dollars......as your business platform is beginning to go downhill and fail as people are walking away and your losing customers .....only been open less than a year....its a shame when you have less competent mangers running such a great product business....."}
{"text":"Had a party of 20, had a good waitress named Jazz, vibe was good until the GM got involved. He sent our waitress home because of some BS.  Peoples order got fucked up....thank you GM. After demanding the GM to come out 4 times, he had a shitty attitude, smart ass comments and blamed all the issues that he caused on the waitress which isn't true.....he fucked it up. 

The chicken was salty, some of the food was cold and the mood was shot. family and i came here to eat and enjoy our time in Vegas and the whole mood if our eating experience was totally FUCKED.....THANK YOU GM. Jazz was our waitress and she was great until the GM sent her home. I won't be coming back and I'm going to let my listeners know....Shout out to Jazz."}
{"text":"I love the uncle-brutha's shrimp and grits, but he service is a complete disaster! We waited 15 minutes before anyone would take our order. When she finally came to the table to get our drink orders and left without saying another word... By then, we were all ready to order since she took forever acknowledging our existence.  Fast forward another 15 minutes, she came back to get our food order. By now I have asked for water with lemon twice. When she finally arrived with our food, my friends spinach was cold, she doesn't have ranch like she asked for multiple times, and I still didn't have a single slice of lemon. I asked her for some lemons when she finally showed up with ranch sauce. She told me they were out of lemons. I thought \"ok well that's not a big deal.\" Until.... SHE SHOWED UP WITH AT LEAST 4 MORE DRINKS FROM THE BACK THAT HAD LEMONS IN IT! Why even lie? 1.5 hours to get food, eat for 5 minutes, get aggravated, and leave.  Food isn't worth it. I'll go to the grits cafe! Their food is just as good, and they are friendly."}
{"text":"First visit to this place. After waiting a long time to be seated even with plenty of tables obviously available we again waited for a long time before we were served our drinks. When the drink order came it wrong and my coffee mug was splattered with egg yolk. After another long wait our server finally took our food orders and I asked for a fresh cup of coffee.  When the food finally came out or server brought out a new cup of coffee but it was ful of coffee grounds floating in the mug and smeared up the sides. The food was adequate but we were completely ignored by our server after we got our food. Bottom line even if the food is ok, it is served on dirty dishes and the service is lousy. This will be the only time I ever eat here."}
