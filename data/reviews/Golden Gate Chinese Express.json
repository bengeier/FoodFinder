{"text":"Really a O Star.  I ordered delivery at 6:45 pm.  They called at 7:30 to tell us their credit card machine was broken and would not deliver since we did not have the sufficient cash.  Why they waited so long to call us, I do not know.  They ruined our evening.  I will NEVER order from there again."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time and money.  I should have called the health department after eating here.  I was so sick after eating from this place.  I ordered the egg foo young and was sick a few hours later.  I spent what seemed like hours in the bathroom.  I will never ever ever ever ever eat anything from this place. Never!"}
{"text":"decent chinese food. not a standout, but it gets the job done. quick service too."}
