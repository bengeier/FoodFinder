{"text":"Rivals my experiences at Napa valley restaurants.  Very unique menu. Interesting appetizers, excellent well prepared fish dishes.  The wine list was excellent and prices were moderate. The restored Lucas house provided an intimate experience with excellent service by Ty."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here. Heard great things about the place and the reviews are great. At the end of the night we were a bit disappointed. Nothing spectacular for the money. We had the apple purse which I think would do well as a dessert, very sweet soaked in butter and heavy sauce.  Sweet breads had good flavor and were cooked well.  My husband had the elk that was well prepared but garnish was somewhat dry. The rabbit was again very heavy with cheese, cream sauce and bacon. Silk pie was our favorite,  although my cinnamon bun special was dry and tasteless. Not as good as we were expecting. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"What a food experience!  \"I feel bad for whoever didn't order the Elk\" is what my wife said after her first few bites.  Overall, it was a great experience from the wait staff, the hostesses, the apps to the desserts --- I use my NJ/NY pallet experiences as a benchmark and this Charlotte dining experience is in my top #5!    Our dishes: Raw Oysters- different twist, but good (caveat - we're used to traditional cocktail sauce and fresh horseradish)  Carpaccio- deliciously excellent!  Octopus- very good; the addition of olives produced a higher salt content than I would have liked, but the various other textures made it very tasty and enjoyable  Elk Chop- ***** 5 STARS!! My first elk experience and it was fantastic.  The compilation of a flavors including a mustard glaze, marinated shredded cabbage, and horseradish infused gnocchi-esque creation was to die for... Seriously, last meal worthy!  Beignets- These just put us in the euphoric state of \"life's worth the stresses as long as we can afford to eat like this\" mood ;)  Sugar, fried dough, coffee ice cream over a Bed of cinnamon and a lovely dipping sauce.    Topped it off with a French pressed coffee and 10-yr Tawny port.  The End.  To the Chef/Owner: Bravo!  Pros- everything above plus a friendly server, Jennifer, that made it that much better.  Cons- ......"}
{"text":"All of my experiences with Fig Tree have been fantastic! I brought my parents here for a celebration and we all loved it! The price is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Fig Tree is set up in beautiful home setting and we got place near fire place on request. I read about all great reviews online and reserved special time for our second anniversary. It was working day and we both got late for our reservation so we called to check if they can postpone our reservation.Staff was very friendly and they said just be here when you can! They set the mood right :) And from the moment we went there experience was wonderful. Every bite was so tasteful and unqiue flavours made our day even more special and amazing and they decorated our dessert with beautiful anniversary wishes. Would love to go back! Thanks eveyrone at Fig Tree for great time!"}
{"text":"When I drop $150 on a meal for 2 people, I expect something very near perfection otherwise I'm disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good (filet and lamb chops), but I really just don't understand the cost.  I like the craftsman style structure of the restaurant and the intimate feel.  The service was descent, but nothing really to write home about.  I can easily say I will not go here again unless someone else is paying.  There are too many excellent, reasonably priced restaurants in Charlotte for me to want to re-vist the Fig Tree."}
{"text":"A quaint and unique place to take out of town guests. There is a great variety of food and everything we tried was delicious.  Our waiter was great, very knowledgeable on the wine list (which is extensive and reasonably priced) and was very helpful checking on everything we ordered for a shellfish allergy.  Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"It did not disappoint! I could basically drink a glass of the orange habanero sauce on the Octopus. The Elk Chop was cooked to perfection (although I can't say that I totally loved the sides that it came with). I had the grouper topped with lobster and it was delightful. We were hesitant about ordering dessert because we were so full, but we ended up eating every bite because it was so good!  Tip: don't try to be a hero and pick from the wine menu if you are not a wine expert. Give your waiter your price range and wine preferences and let them pick from the 1,000 choices. We got a bottle for $80 that was well over $150 at the last restaurant we were at."}
{"text":"The food was marvelous, however the service was even better! We celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here for a Sunday night dinner. When my friend made the reservation, they asked if it was for a special occasion. He responded, \"Yes, for my friend Erik's birthday.\" When we arrived, the hostess asked who Erik was then greeted him with a \"thank you for joining us on your birthday.\" We were promptly seated. Then our friendly, knowledgeable waitress Ivy arrived. She looked straight at Erik and greeted him with another \"happy birthday.\" (Obviously the hostess spoke to the waitress so she knew who in our group was the birthday boy.) What a nice touch. The meal was delicious. Then to top it off, when Erik's dessert arrived, the chef had written Happy Birthday on the plate in chocolate. Another very nice touch. Great experience made even better by the top-notch crew."}
{"text":"Wonderful anniversary dinner! Very cozy & romantic..food was FABULOUS & service was great!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and I'm glad I finally did! I went here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday and the service and food was really good.    JD was our server and I was really appreciate of how attentive he was without being overbearing and how knowledgeable of the menu he was.  We ordered the beef carpaccio and the house stuffed mozzerella for appetizers.  Both tasted so fresh and delicious.    The meals all come with a house salad (a nice touch!) but my boyfriend ordered the gazpacho soup instead for a couple extra dollars and let me tell you, it was totally worth it! Definitely the best gazpacho I've ever tried.  Entrees that were ordered were the scallops, elk, veal and the dinner special.  Everything was really good.  After trying a bite of everyone's, I came to the conclusion that whoever is making the sauces in the kitchen really knows what they're doing because the sauce on everyone's dish was amazing!  This is definitely a romantic, beautiful restaurant.  I will definitely be back on another special occasion!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to dine here as my friends have been raving about it.  Let me tell you, it's worth all the hype!  It's stunningly beautiful.  My meal was absolutely delicious and presented so pretty.  Can't wait to get back to visit Charlotte again!!"}
{"text":"Amazing meal, great service and romantic setting. If you hate feeling underdressed, be sure ladies , you are wearing a cocktail dress and men are in sports jackets. Many of the customers seemed to be celebrating a special occasion."}
{"text":"The servers are very attentive. They are informative, patient and very courteous. Their dishes have an excellent presentation. I went there for my first time, ordere the lamb chop and it was a little too salty for me. However, my partner had the pork chops and that was delicious!"}
{"text":"If you're in Charlotte, go here. Seriously, dismiss the objection that just bubbled up in your mind, and go here. Amazing food and great service. When something didn't come out quite right, they fixed it, let us enjoy our meal, and then proceeded to comp THE ENTIRE MEAL. The elk chop was hearty and delightfully tender, and the chocolate and graham tart was the perfect size and was composed perfectly. Highest recommendation."}
{"text":"The food was great. It was my birthday. We didn't order a dessert so what the birthday girl got was a candle on an empty plate. The server made a point to say we didn't order a dessert. I guess a bill if over $260 didn't deserve even a cookie. Great food but the server was like a piece of dried toast. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"My friend took me for my birthday and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. We started with the yellow fin tuna as an appetizer. I had the lamb chops and he had the veal. The lamb was seasoned and cooked perfectly. They serve it with an Israeli Couscous that is delicious and a great accompaniment to the lamb.  Everything was delicious!! And I highly recommend the Beignets for dessert! I felt like I had been temporarily transported to N'awlins!!!  The restaurant is in an old house, which gives the place lots of charm and character. They also have a nice wine list and the staff are very friendly and attentive. This is one of the best places in Charlotte to celebrate a special occasion. The ambiance, the food and the service are all excellent. It's one of my favorite dinning experiences in town."}
{"text":"The crab hushpuppies were my favorite item.  The setting is very intimate and friendly - we sat on the porch and despite it being a 'nicer' restaurant, the atmosphere was quaint, casual and inviting.  Would certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"I've dined here one time (so far) and as I told our excellent server (Charles? it's been a number of months so I might not have the right name), I've experienced two Michelin rated restaurants (so far) and have had many exceptional dining experiences in my international travels, and my complete experience at Fig Tree was on par with anywhere I've been in 15 countries (so far). Upon taking our order, Charles provided a comprehensive wine recommendation (we decided upon Andrew Geoffrey Cabernet and forgive me for forgetting the year, perhaps 2009?) that resulted in one of the finest pairings I've experienced. As Charles indicated, the wine would evolve in its complexity over time as the meal progressed and this was so very true. Over the course of dinner we had escargot, scallops, a lobster ravioli, elk chop, fish (I don't recall the type), and a chocolate dessert. We ended up ordering two bottles of the Andrew Geoffrey as it was almost peculiar how well it paired, no matter the dish- though admittedly, neither me or my girlfriend have a particularly sophisticated wine pallet. So take that for what it's worth. The ambiance of Fig Tree is terrific as it lies within a renovated house. In summary, the service was truly stupendous and the quality of the cuisine, and how well it was cooked, was as good as I've ever had and for those who value the Michelin rating system the Fig Tree is, in my judgement, easily on par with the one and two star establishments I've been to."}
{"text":"Ate there last night and the food and service was superb!   We started with the octopus appetizer which was delicious.   I had the Elk for the first time.   I enjoyed it very much.   Even better than a high quality filet mignon.  I highly recommend the restaurant for a special night out."}
{"text":"Across these board a fantastic experience!  Food, wine list, service, decor all five star.  A truly great restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff.  They even accommodated our 10 month old for an early family night out."}
{"text":"We come here every year for our anniversary. Its a pleasure! Excellent service. Spectacular food. Its very pricey but thats why we treat ourselves once a year. Try their French Press coffee- its the best!"}
{"text":"Quiet ambiance. Amazing service, even better food. Will be permanently in our special dinner rotation in charlotte."}
{"text":"The restaurant was wonderful, but our server did not make this a blissful birthday dining experience.  Do we fault the restaurant or the server (who didn't even tell us his name)?  Unfortunately, the server is part of the entire experience and his lack of attention and uncomfortable recitation of the specials was only the beginning.  Did he have too many tables?  Did we look too young?  Was he new?  Our appetizer never made it to the table and his response as our entrees were set down was that he \"must have forgotten to write it down.\"  Excuse me sir, but you didn't write anything down.  No other comments were made by the waiter on this subject.  Everything we put in our mouths was delish.  The roasted garlic spread we lapped up with only forks after we finished our bread and devoured the spinach salads with a quail egg and warm bacon maple dressing.  The elk was decadent in the Bearnaise sauce and the hearty portion of ostrich steak was cooked perfectly.    I believe strongly in customer service and this waiter just didn't have the over the top feel you would expect from a restaurant of this perceived quality.  I recommend the restaurant and the food for a high end dining experience, but not the waiter."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! My first time dining in Charlotte was a great experience at The Fig Tree. You can eat outside on the front porch on a beautiful 80 degree evening.  The garlic spread was way too strong for me, but the Lobster Hush Puppies and Chorizo Stuffed Calamari were amazing. Ask for the Calamari to be pre-sliced for bite sized portions. I guess they normally serve it as one large piece, but our request for smaller pieces was nicely met. They should consider serving this way, as the presentation was quite nice.  The Grouper and Maine Lobster Tail over Rissoto really couldn't have been any better! Not fishy at all, and bursting with flavor!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite high end restaurant in Charlotte.  No million dollar decor.  A very welcoming and cozy place.  Exceptional wine selection and a chef driven kitchen that always has something fun and unique to try.  Go with time to spare because it is very easy to have time just fly by."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte this Monday December 1st on business and we were brought here by the guests.  Everything was splendid; from the food to the excellent customer service.  I has the Lamb dish was well prepared, generous helping, and beyond SUPERB!  The bartender(kind of a bald guy) was such a gentleman!!  The waiters and hostesses went above and beyond with service.  Will return again on my next visit."}
{"text":"I rarely feel the need to write a review, especially on the positive side of things, but this restaurant absolutely nailed it. From the minute we walked in, each experience was a 10/10. Each course was better than the previous, capped by a ridiculous dessert menu - my wife and I got 3 because we couldn't choose just 2.    Highly, highly recommended.  Best restaurant in Charlotte by a country mile.   Don't think twice, this is your spot."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been here twice and were blown out of the water on both occasions.  Every dish that we have tried was perfectly balanced!  Our servers were very knowledgable about wine pairings and menu items.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband, my daughter, son-in-law and I went to The Fig Tree to celebrate my birthday this evening. We were seated outside and it was lovely. We had a terrific waiter. Our appetizers and entrees were very good although we were told they didn't have the duck and only one portion of the beef carpaccio. Really???? After the meal, we were asked if we wanted dessert and said no. The waiter then brought out a plate with the words Happy Birthday written in chocolate sauce with a small lit candle. This is the cheesiest thing I have ever seen. Better to have not done anything. Most places give you a complimentary birthday dessert or skip it altogether but never anything ridiculous like this. If you want to be a classy restaurant Fig Tree then be one. Don't cut silly corners!"}
{"text":"Just returned from Fig Tree. I think the cook went a little too happy with the sea salt. Felt like I might need a cholesterol and high blood pressure check up tomorrow.   Bread was cold and dry and laced with sea salt Calamari which we got fried.... Extremely laced with it Filet.... First bite was sea salt over load  They asked my wife and I if we wanted dessert. We chuckled at the thought. Thank goodness we had cake at home.   Never again.   On the bright side the service was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this lovely restaurant, very much so!   Your typical $30ish entrees; Interesting and yummy dishes.  Reasonably priced beverages, specials and food in general.   Thought they had large portions.  I was impressed with low pricing, great value.   Thought the dishes were super tasty, fun and fresh.   Wish they had a fig salad.  LOL!  Loved this spot!  Great for date!   Nice staff.  Make reservations though.  Cute outdoor seating.  Enjoy!!!   Had such a nice time here :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the service I would give the food 3 stars. Not sure if I just had too high of expectations but like a previous reviewer said I thought the best part of the meal was my salad. I got the Elk and it was great to try something different. My issue is the sides cabbage and some weird lentil did not compliment the Elk at all. Would of loved some type of potatoes or risotto cake."}
{"text":"The Fig Tree is the best restaurant I have been to in Charlotte.  The food is fantastic, the service is impeccable and the atmosphere is great.  I have yet to have a bad experience at Fig Tree.  Additionally, they do not have a large mark up on their wines.  The menu also varies throughout the year.  The house salad with warm calamari and goat cheese is a great way to start your meal.  I don't mind paying a little more for a great meal.  One last tip, when making your reservation, ask them for the Dunkin Donuts bread pudding.  It's KILLER!!!"}
{"text":"We visited for our anniversary and my husband had the elk chop and I had the lobster with grouper. We started with lobster hushpuppies and perused their lengthy wine list. Our server, Gary was fantastic with recommendations and all of our food and wine came out top notch! This restaurant is in a beautiful location and we had a fantastic table on the 2nd floor. The fig tree is doing something right, well, pretty much everything right. We will keep this restaurant on the short list for our special occasion spots!"}
{"text":"When you want something special, this is the spot.  The atmosphere could not be cooler but then again, I am a sucker for an old house.  The bar is super cool and the upstairs rooms so special.  The food and service is 5-star.  It is pricey but you know it will be worth it.  A home run all around!"}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner! Kurt, our waited was amazingly friendly, attentive and helpful. My husband tried the elk, one of their signature dishes and I had the grouper/flounder. Wish I'd had room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Service was the shining star here. I had the feature which was New York strip topped with king crab and my handsome date had triggerfish w/ hen of the woods. We were both very pleased with our meals.....we ordered a blue label Johnny walker on the rocks after the black label that tasted more like the red. If your paying 36 bucks for one drink...a couple ounces of scotch. it should not be served with the same ice they use for the sweet tea or soda. They need to step up there game here with better filtered or spring water large ice cubes. The drink is almost ruined after 5mins with the small cubes. Other then that it's solid dinning experience."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Good entrees and wine list, great desserts. Seasonal  menu is always changing but always good. Had the antelope and was blown away. Never had it before and didn't know what to think, staff let me try it, no worries. Would go again for special occasions, a little pricey."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I have ever been to- The ambiance is so soothing. Great wine and fantastic food. We spent four hours here dining with family. Everything flowed so smoothly. I didn't want to leave. The lobster was fantastic- Also tried the Elk- Class A place to eat. Highly recommended. Will be back"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The food and service are superior to most restaurants in the area. I also really loved the ambiance of the restaurant, smaller rooms, romantic and quaint to celebrate a special occasion. What also stood out is we had the table as long as we wanted it. This isn't a restaurant that double books so you can take your time & savor the experience. Finally, order the Beggar's Purse, it's outrageously good!"}
{"text":"My medium grilled elm steak is well cooked but the bacon braised cabbage is just way too salty, the thinly sliced potato gratin is carefully prepared, but a simpler version of potato can be a winner than this. The foie gras is grilled right, but, nothing I especially like it. For this more than $90 dinner, I find the FREE rosemary olive oil and the creamy garlic spread for the FREE bread are way better than the expensive, very oily, salty offerings.  Guess I won't come back."}
{"text":"Outstanding service.  Food was excellent.  Great wine selection.  Beautiful ambiance.  This restaurant helps be draw the line between 4 star and 5 star."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last Sunday night to celebrate for my girlfriend birthday. We have reservations at 8.30pm and we got there around 8pm. Once we came inside the hostess welcome us warmly, she lead us to the bar because we came early. When the table is ready she seated us and hand the menu while she introduce the restaurant. It's really great. After that, the waiter coming and introduce himself, and asking us for the drink. We had taittinger brut champagne. And after that he let us know their special appetizer. And he really knows all the menus we asked. He's great! All the food that we order are amazing! I was order lamb and my girlfriend had lobster. We had amazing dinner! It's truly recommended."}
{"text":"Our experience at Fig Tree was absolutely amazing. Could not have been better in any way. We moved to Charlotte on May 8th and our anniversary was May 12th, so not a whole lot of time to figure out the best place to go for our celebration. We asked around and narrowed it down to 3 places and went with our gut, which was Fig Tree....the outdoor patio. It was raining that night, so the setting was especially romantic. The food was just perfect...I sound like I am just gushing but it was! From appetizers and drinks all the way to dessert, we could not have been happier. And, as if all of that weren't enough, we had probably the best waiter we've ever encountered (and we've been to a lot of restaurants in our 40+ years!). Kurt was a pro....knowledgeable, kind, funny and attentive. He even sent us a thank you card following our visit...incredible! We cannot wait to return to this fine restaurant. If you are deliberating between places, for a special occasion as we were....search no further!"}
{"text":"We wanted to go somewhere special Saturday night and read good things about this place on Yelp. It is a charming old house and the staff is very attentive. They have patio seating available.  We really had  a great time.  My only criticism is the meals are a little pricey for what you get.  The salads were nothing special, I had pasta and my girlfriend had the duck. Her duck was delicious,  my pasta, good."}
{"text":"I couldn't think of one reason to not go back again.  We don't live in Charlotte and love trying new restaurants but we are definitely going back to this one on our next trip. I had the grouper with lobster, their signature dish. It was served on a bed of risotto and peas.  The lobster was cooked perfectly and not just doused in the yummy buttery sauce.  The roasted garlic puree that came with the bread was delicious as well. The house salad had a beautiful presentation and a simple herb vinaigrette.   Our waiter Devon made the experience even richer, as if that was possible.  He knew everything about every dish and the wines they served. He had professional yet affable demeanor. It showed that the restaurant really puts a lot of hard work in the food they serve and the staff they keep.  Strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Totally impressed by their food and especially service ! It's my husband birthday . Everyone is greeting and smiling to us. They also use chocolate to write Happy Birthday on our dessert plates as well as send us a free dessert plate as gift ! Love this place !"}
{"text":"Been meaning to visit this place for awhile, finally made it.......it was GREAT the escargot the  beggars purse and the Duck..all great.. The food was fantastic. But I will tell you what really made the night were the employees. From the start, I called to see if they could fit us in, Sarah asked when would like to come it was around six and I said right away.but told her my girlfriend just went upstairs to get ready she, said better put this down for seven, she was right. I'm sure all the servers are great but Rebecca (don't call her Becky) and Kala (don't call her Katlin) were the best..I wish there was a second rating on yelp for service and friendliness on here but there wouldn't be enough stars for this staff..didn't get their names but the other two hostess were great...great food great service this is our new go to place. Not sure whos is responsible for hiring for this place but they are spot on.."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant- I only wish I could afford to eat here more often! Food was perfect, wine selection was amazing, the waiter was attentive and super nice, and the atmosphere can't be beat (quiet, romantic, beautiful). Go Here! I still love Zebra and Barrington's, but Fig Tree definitely beats them out."}
{"text":"4.5 of 5 stars (excellent fine dining).  What to wear: a jacket would be nice, maybe a tie (if it's a special occasion).  What to take: a thirst for wine.  The Fig Tree has some awesome prices on more expensive bottles.  For example: Joseph Phelps Insignia, 2006, Napa Valley cab.  Price?  $140.  Total Wine sells the same bottle for $150.  If you have mobility problems, be sure to insist on being seated downstairs for there are some tables up.  Want to give them 4.5 stars because they don't do the little extras as the best 5 star places (e.g., amuse-bouche, palette cleanser, etc.).  In a lovingly refurbished older home.  Well-trained staff.  Simple, uncluttered menu with enough choices for all.  About $60 per person, no dessert, no booze, gratuity not included.  About my ratings:  Only fine dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.  Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):  1) fast food (no table service)  2) casual dining (table service)  3) fine dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, typically more expensive than casual dining)  Fine dining can earn a max of five stars.  Casual dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars."}
{"text":"Great food, great wine and great service. My only complaint is that we live in Texas and can't get to visit the restaurant more often!"}
{"text":"What a lovely place to eat. Service was great and our meal was delicious. Very cozy and our waiter David couldn't have been more gracious considering we felt slightly underdressed. Had the lobster and chocolate silk pie for dessert. Our waiter was my favorite part."}
{"text":"Amazing food,  excellent service, and quiet atmosphere. One of our favorites so far in Charlotte!  Our waiter David was perfect and his recommendation of the chef special fish that night was spot on."}
{"text":"Everything from the moment you walk in the door screams \"class\".   You are treated like royalty during the entire visit.  The fish is particularly well done, as were the desserts.  Next time, I will be brave and try some of the more exotic dishes available here."}
{"text":"Food is complex, unpretentious and beautifully executed.  Ambiance is warm and relaxing.  Wine list is deep and has tremendous values - they do not mark up prices the same as most restaurants.  Service is seamless.  Cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Had the Elk which was very good.  Recommend you ask for it rare as they prepare it a little on the \"done side\" in my opinion.  Service was outstanding and really liked the family style seating. ( If you are looking for a more private/intimate setting you might go elsewhere.)  The lamb is also quite good and the deserts are super.  A very welcoming and well managed restaurant!!  Felt like I ate in someone's home.  Very rare thing these days."}
{"text":"Dined here for my lady's birthday in late February and enjoyed everything from start to finish. The food was outstanding and the service was great. We have driven by here so many times and always planned to dine here, I'm glad that we finally did. I had the stuffed calamari and the amazing elk chop, the birthday girl had the beet carpaccio and the scallops and enjoyed both. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try Fig Tree after years of living in Charlotte and hearing the hype. Unfortunately, we found the food to be severely overrated. We were very disappointed. I'll give them credit for an excellent wine list, romantic ambiance, excellent service even the menu is 5 stars for fresh farm to table focus. But if you are a true foodie this is not the restaurant for you until they address the execution issue in the kitchen. The food was satisfactory at best."}
{"text":"We were sitting at home last week trying to figure out where in the world we could celebrate our 200th Queen City Restaurant Review when all of the sudden... The Fig Tree Restaurant popped into our heads. The Fig Tree has been on our must-hit list for a very long time and an obvious pick for our 200th review.  The Fig Tree is located in a 1913 bungalow in Charlotte's Elizabeth neighborhood just minutes from our house. I made reservations online a week prior and left a note requesting our table be somewhere in the house with decent lighting. When we arrived we were seated quickly and at a table at the front of the house with amazing natural light just as the sun was setting.  We kicked off the night with a Fig tart with taleggio and prosciutto over a red wine reduction.  It seemed largely inappropriate to order any appetizer not featuring figs while at the Fig Tree Restaurant and without a doubt it was the right decision. The deliciously flaky crust was obviously home made and came topped with a melty and salty cheese that balanced out perfectly with the sweet figs. The red wine reduction added a a great touch of sweetness and fruity tannins to compliment the figs.  The Sweet corn chowder with prosciutto come out next and despite being delicious... may have been a little underwhelming also. For the most part it just tasted like a big bowl of fancy cream corn. Im definitely not a chowder expert but if I could offer one suggestion it would be to add some herb crusted roasted potato cubes.  I (Ella) got the Grilled New Zealand Elk Chop over smashed finger link potatoes with Smoked Bacon-Braised Purple Cabbage and Boursin Dijon Sauce. It doesn't happen often but I was really excited to see something on a menu that I have never had before. I was expecting it to be gamey kind of like a bigger version of venison, but I was pleasantly surprised by its subtle flavor and tender texture. The dish originally came  with a horseradish spaetzle which went well with the other side items, but I don't particularly like horseradish so I went with the mashed potatoes instead. The mashed potatoes matched nicely with the smokey cabbage and delicious dijon sauce. I really enjoyed everything about this dish and cant wait to try elk again.  I (Curtis) got the Grilled Filet Mignon topped with Stilton Cheese and Mushroom Duxelles over a Sweet Corn Polenta Cake with a Veal Demi-Glace and a side of Asparagus. Filet Mignon always leaves me wanting more... more flavor, more meat, more anything. The Stilton cheese was delicious but was countered by the lack luster and not-so-sweet corn polenta cake. The high points to the filet mignon were the euphoric aroma, the plate composition, and the filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I (Ella) was very impressed with the dessert menu at Fig Tree. As a pastry chef myself, I get really bored with the same old dessert options that I see on every dessert menu. Luckily for me the desserts on this menu were complex and full of interesting flavors and garnishes. The Dark Chocolate Mousse and Chocolate Glacage over Coffee Crémeux and Almond Shortbread with Coffee Gelato caught my eye for dessert. The chocolate mousse was deliciously light with a dark chocolate bitterness that matched perfectly with the coffee flavors in the cremeux and the gelato. The almonds added a much needed crunch to a very soft dish and the pulled sugar garnish seemed like a halo topping a perfect dessert.  Despite some light redicule from my pastry chef partner... I (Curtis) went with the only classic on the menu, the S'mores Cheesecake. Unknown to me the S'mores cheesecake was nothing like the original classic I have come to love over the years, it was way better! It was smaller than normal but the small size packed a very large flavor. The graham cracker base came topped with a very dense cheesecake cube, a micro pond of dark chocolate, several hand made torched marshmallows, and a very adorable chocolate swirly thing. The whole dessert was amazing and a must have for anyone visiting the Fig Tree.  The Fig Tree Restaurant lived up to our expectations and despite not falling in love with the Filet Mignon we cant wait to go back. The app was delicious, the entrees were unique, and the desserts were more than memorable."}
{"text":"Excellent menu variety, you can't find food like this in many places around the city. The experience was amazing, thank you!"}
{"text":"Do you love food?  We flew into Charlotte for a short weekend.  I yelped for a restaurant for Friday night dinner, early, and was fortunate to pick TFT.  Set in an remodeled older home the tree is welcoming and a comfortable environment.  The menu hits of a creative chef who keeps a southern menu balanced with a creative approach.  We tried a few appetizers (the purse and the tart) and a few salads (the caesar and the beet).  All were perfect.  The entrees were very yummy.  I had a seared tuna which made my day.   The waiter, Ty, was perfect as well.  Just friendly enough to make us feel welcome while knowing when to back away and give us space.   I promise if you love food and you want to enjoy a great little restaurant try this place.  Next trip to Charlotte we will go back."}
{"text":"The grouper and lobster entree was dry and the risotto rather boring, for an over $40 entree with no veggies. I remember getting a salad, but I don't remember it. Husband's caesar salad was oversalted.  My husband had the filet and it was ok, but nothing special. Wine recommendation had to be sent back, as it was a lame red...white wine decent, but pour was very chintzy. Waiter was a bit arrogant--just enough to dampen the mood. The table was long and we were so far apart and so close to the tables next to us, that we really couldn't talk.  We have years of experience with outstanding Charlotte food and various price points. This time was much different than our great experience at this restaurant a year ago.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came out to Fig Tree on Tuesday night to celebrate our anniversary. After the meal was over, I had this space out moment where I was in food contentment heaven.....that's a sign of an amazing meal! I always have a hard time writing reviews for a meal that was just so incredible, that it is hard to describe. So, here is my attempt.  The Fig Tree is located in an old house (like 100 plus years old) that has been remodeled slightly. We were seated upstairs in one of the rooms. Nice and romantic setting.   We were given a wine list to look through. The wine list was extremely extensive. We knew we wanted a Zinfindel and asked the waiter for his recommendation. Based on our discussion, it was obvious he was extremely knowledgable about the wines. The wine we settled on was absolutely delicious. Definitely exceeded our expectations.   First they delivered this garlic spread with fresh bread. The bread was perfect and that garlic spread was amazing. Keeping it to one piece (ok, two, let's be honest here) was difficult.   We placed our order and ordered the escargot for an ap. For our meals, I got the filet mignon and my husband got the special, which was a white fish.  The escargot was super rich and tasty. The gorgonzola cream sauce was absolutely incredible. The waiter knew what he was doing and brought us more bread just to dip in the sauce. The escargot were cooked perfectly, but man, that gorgonzola sauce. Made the dish.  Before the meals came out, we each got a salad. The salads come wtih the meal, which is really nice and something unusual for a nice restaurant. The herb dressing on the salad was nice and light. Delish.  When the meals came out, I was thinking there was no way the meal could get any better. Oh, it did. The steak was cooked absolutely perfect. You barely needed a knife to cut it. The grit cake and greens that came with it were a great combo. All three together made this amazing flavor combo. The serving was probably around 8oz (which is way too much for me, so my hubby got to finish up my meal to his delight!). My husbands fish was very nice. The risotto that came wtih it was the show stopper. It was incredibly flavorful. Absolutely perfect.   Lastly we decided to split the brownie/red velvet/cheesecake dessert. They even decorated it with Happy Anniversary!! Great end to an incredible meal.  This is a must restaurant to celebrate a special occasion as the meal was so amazing, it made the whole evening even more special then it already was."}
{"text":"The Fig Tree can count their lucky stars that the sea bass was, in the immortal words of Gordon Ramsay, \"f*cking glistening,\" otherwise this review would stink.   I made our reservation for a Sunday night at 8PM through Open Table. I asked for a romantic spot, specifying we were driving from New Hampshire to South Carolina to visit my parents for Christmas--that's a 17 hour drive when you are not travelling in a polar vortex snowshitstorm--and that we'd be stopping at The Fig Tree to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday.   I asked if they could do something \"special.\" Now granted, this restaurant is known for being a \"special events\" place--you know, that place where people get engaged, celebrate anniversaries and birthdays, so maybe they think every spot in the house is \"special,\" but let me tell you which spot is not:  The table in the corner of a small room on the second floor--I doubt there's going to be a fireplace up there?--next to a window with an airconditioner perched on the sill. The other three tables are occupied: a twenty-something Hipster Couple on our side of the room, an elderly couple who we later learn are celebrating their 39th wedding anniversary, and across from us, a man and woman in their late twenties. Let's call the gal Tipsy. The dude with her is glaringly, obnoxiously drunk. We'll call him ShitFace.   We order our drinks over ShitFace's \"Let's bond, yo!\" yelling at the Hipster Couple. I order a $10 glass of Huia Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, and Hubby gets a $13 Lemelson Pinot Noir from Oregon. The wine list is impressive.     Our wine arrives and our waiter--The Pro--informs us of the specials, which includes sea bass on a bed of lobster risotto. Hubby orders escargot (Burgundy Helix Snails with Cremini Mushrooms in Creamy Gorgonzola Sauce over Crostini, $10) and the elk chop, medium rare (Grilled New Zealand Elk Chop over Horseradish Spaetzle with Smoked Bacon-Braised Purple Cabbage and Boursin-Dijon Sauce, $42) and I get a Spanish style cold octopus salad ($16) and the sea bass ($38). The entrees come with a salad, so we both get Caesars with white anchovies.  ShitFace gets cut off, and he is protesting loudly. This is an \"inside voice\" kind of establishment, and he's using his \"calling a buddy on a jet ski\" voice. We keep our heads down. The white tablecloths are mesmerizing until I accidently make eye contact. \"That woman!\" ShitFace yells at Tipsy. \"She is looking at me!\" I surreptitiously clutch my knife under my napkin, in case he and I are about to rumble. My heart is pounding. This situation is far from \"romantic fireside dinner\" and more \"being pelted by rotten verbal eggs in a pseudo-wrestling ring.\" With Christmas music.   Our starters arrive and we delve in, happy for the distraction. We concentrate on our food, sharing bites, comparing notes. Both dishes are delicious.   The Pro returns and hands the check to ShitFace, who has made it to his feet. The Pro holds him by the elbow while ShitFace squints at the check.\"How much money you want?\"  \"Kid! Please!\"Tipsy says. \"Don't.\"   ShitFace tries to decipher the bill. Eventually, he writes something with as much flourish as he can muster. \"Is this enough?\" He shoves the check back at The Pro. \"Is it?\"  The woman starts to stand, but sits down again, hard on the chair. \"Don't.\"  \"I'm just asking him if it is 20%.\" The Pro looks and from the flare of his nostrils, it is more than 20%. \"That's fine, Sir, thank you,\" The Pro supports ShitFace, \"Now, this way, please...\" They are almost out the door when, turns out Tipsy is, well, tipsier than anyone realized. As she gets up, she hitches her handbag over her shoulder. This is a mistake. What little equilibrium she had disappears. Windmill hands. Uh oh. Two chairs go flying as she plops down hard on her ass on the floor. Two servers scoop her up.   Hubby and I are gobsmacked. What the hell just happened? I'm mad. After 22 years together, he knows me. \"Let it go,\" he says. \"Let's reset.\"    So we do. The food is delicious. Turns out elk tastes like if a steak and a lamb chop had a baby. The sea bass is perfect, flaky, and as I said, glistening. The risotto is tender, not soupy, and the lobster is, well, lobstah. Once our wine is replenished, and we have the room to ourselves, we finish our dinner in peace, right there next to the air conditioner in the window, listening to Christmas songs jingling, barely missing the romantic table by the roaring fire.   Wrong: We should never have been seated in that room. The drunk couple should have been refused service when they arrived.   Right: They comped the most expensive round of drinks we ordered ($30) and The Pro apologized.   Repeat? Obviously, this was an exceptionally negative experience, and I was not going to cut the kitchen any slack, but I couldn't fault the food (and, honestly, by then, I was trying). Everything we had was yummy.  A final note: Don't be THAT guy. Ever.  Tipsy, you can do better. And ShitFace, get help."}
{"text":"Went back for my birthday, and it's still one of my favorite Charlotte restaurants--the food is just wonderful. And get this--I got a thank you/happy birthday card from our waiter, which was a supremely classy move. The pork chop, which was mew and kind of a take on sweet and sour pork, was...there aren't words. Super crispy, flavorful sauce, generous portion. Ugh, it put my fish special, which was terrific, to shame. And the beignets for dessert? Shut up. The whole thing was fab, including our Oregon Pinot Noir."}
{"text":"Very good, but didn't quite live up to the hype. To start, the service is exceptional: friendly, super knowledgeable staff who aren't pushy at all. Very laid back, rustic atmosphere as well. The food itself is quite good, albeit just slightly overpriced. The cheese plate was top notch. The elk chop was hyped up so I chose that. It was delicious, but didn't quite meet the expectations I had. Overall, a great experience but again just a bit too pumped up."}
{"text":"The food is inspired.  I would give them a five star on food.  The service and environment were less so for us.  The waiter just seemed unengaged.  Normally you expect very friendly and engaged wait staff at a restaurant where it is easy to spend $60-100 a person.  We went for our anniversary, it was noted on the reservation, we were put in a room close to the door with a very loud group of people.  None of the staff said a word about a special evening.  The place is marked as being dressy and romantic.  A lot of people were there in jeans and polos even on a Saturday night.  The food was wonderful and we will go back for it but I will not put it on my places to go for a special occasion.  Definitely a place for foodies but not somewhere to have a romantic dinner or quiet conversation."}
{"text":"My husband and I just recently tried the Fig Tree Restaurant, and WOW was I so happy that we did!  The food was AMAZING, it was very cozy and the server made sure to stay on top of our every need.  The wine list was perfect!"}
{"text":"My partner and I came for our anniversary last weekend, and the food was stellar.  We both got the soup of the day add on with our entree, which was broccoli and cheddar, with goat cheese soup. The soup was phenomenal, the puree was a great texture perfectly creamy and I absolutely adored the goat cheese. My entree was the special of the day, sauteed striped bass over dungeness crab risotto, asparagus. Everything was cooked very well, seasoned well without being overly salty, perfect texture on the asparagus -- and a good amount of crab in the risotto.   My partner's meal was very good as well. Scallops over couscous and hominy. The scallops were absolutely perfectly cooked, very tender and sweet.   Service as very good overall -- they cleared the table professionally , between courses and based on the table size and the size of our party. The only thing I didn't love was that we felt a little \" vibe\" off of our server-- for not ordering an appetizer or dessert. He wasn't rude by any stretch, but we did feel a little vibe like we were being cheap, despite spending our anniversary there -- and it was for no reason except that my partner caught a cold and had almost no appetite but still managed to come out to celebrate. I did enjoy the cute homemade blondie that management brought out for our anniversary.  Overall it was a great spot -- romantic, good food, great service. Based on the food alone, I'd come back for a visit."}
{"text":"We went here because of the great reviews on here and ended up not liking it so much. We started with an octopus appetizer which was pretty good and went onto to our entrees I had the Elk chop and my husband had the Grouper with Lobster.  The Elk chop was nice and tender and the horseradish spaetzel was okay. The grouper and lobster was pretty good too. However the reason why I am giving it three stars is because I think it is a little over priced. Our total came out to be around $150 including two glasses of wine. I think the overall experience was good but for my husband and I, the food here was not worth the total on the bill. We don't mind paying for a nice meal but not if the food is not worth it."}
{"text":"I ate here last year for my birthday. Sorry it took me so long to review. I called ahead and asked if we could be seated upstairs since it was my birthday. They galdly accomidated. It was a private dinig expereience I have never had before, we had a whole section to ourselves. Just a thought, they could do more to decorate the balcony overlook, as all you see is a bare balcony, powerlines, and a basketball court in the park near by, but this did not diminish the experience. I've never had a server sweep up my crumbs, felt a little overserved but it was an amazing experience. The food was wonderful. I got the scallops, some of the best I've had. My boyfriend got the elk, very tasty. I will be back. It is very expensive but worth every penny!! If I am going to spend $200 on a meal, I have certain expectations, and they met and exceeded them!!"}
{"text":"We were overall disappointed.  Went there for my husband's birthday.. When we arrived beware that there is work being done right in front of restaurant so getting there is a chore. That of course is no fault of them just wanted to warn you of that fact. We sat down out on the patio and it was nice and we ordered cocktails to start our evening. We decided to get the lobster app to start off with. For us it was over powered by the blood orange taste so you couldn't really taste the lobster. Went on to next course and we both got the Caesar salad..it was good. Then for dinner my birthday guy ordered the special stuffed veal pork chop  and I ordered the fish. The fish was perfect but the veal and potatoes was so salty he could not eat it. He told the waiter that it was to salty and asked for the fish dish instead. A few minutes later he came back with the SAME VEAL and new potatoes and had brushed off the cheese. Mind you this meal was 40 some dollars... I could not believe a high prices restaurant would do such. They should have brought him a freshly cooked veal chop and new potatoes or the fish dish like he asked for. I just don't think that was right...I could be over reacting but when you dine at a restaurant that has high standards I think they should do all they can to satisfy the customer. They did offer him a free dessert but then again it was his birthday so most places do that anyway. It is not the end of the world or anything like that but when you have a special night and pay more than normal it is very disappointing to leave unhappy with your meal."}
{"text":"One of our favorite dinner restaurants in Charlotte. Great food, varied menu and excellent staff. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a classy dinner date location this is the place in charlotte. Found this place on Yelp and after reading the reviews I was sold. Everyone lived up to their word. Environment was romantic and classic. The services was absolutely incredible. The wine selection was extension and the food was mind-blowing."}
{"text":"Great for a special occasion! Amazing wine list and deliciously crafted plates!! Must make a reservation and sitting on the patio is lovely. Restaurant is in a house-turned-restaurant, so it has a fancy but homey feel. I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We made reservations before attending Wicked at Ovens Theater. Reservations were at 6 and the show started at 7:30. The waiter made sure to get us out the door in time for the play.  Besides the outstanding, considerate service, the food was amazing. Everything was well paired, exceeding my expectations."}
{"text":"I SO badly wanted to give five stars to this review -- however I had to deduct one due to all but TWO dishes (out of about 8) being average.  I came here Saturday night with my husband and another couple.  We started with a few appetizers -- Escargot, Scallops & Foie Gras.  Everything was amazing.  All the flavors were so well balanced, the dishes were flavorful and we were very pleased.  The Scallops were cooked PERFECTLY and I know that's not an easy ingredient to perfect.  For entrees we ordered the Grouper & Lobster, Elk Chop, Veal Chop and Truffle Ricotta Ravioli.  The Grouper & Lobster was AMAZING.  It was served over a Saffron Risotto which was delicious and the fish was cooked perfectly.  The lobster had a delicious flavor to it but you could also taste its inherently sweet flavor.  However it was definitely a small portion of fish and lobster for the price of $42.  The Elk Chop was disappointing.  The sides that it was served with didn't complement the dish well and also the meat was very dry.  My husband sent it back and ordered Scallops instead which were good, but not great.  At $37 for 6 scallops, it should be great.  I didn't get to try the Veal Chop but it looked amazing and my friend had rave reviews.  The Truffle Ricotta Ravioli was a BIT on the salty side -- but delicious none-the-less.  For dessert there were so many delicious things so we ordered three items -- Peanut Butter Pie, 5 Layer Red Velvet Cake and Beignets.  I thought the Beignets were the BEST.  They were freshly fried and served with a delicious cinnamon creme and also accompanied by a scoop of coffee gelato.  The sweet beignets with a bite of the coffee gelato was to die for.  The Peanut Butter Pie was good as well, I loved that it was served with a caramel peanut brittle.  The Red Velvet Cake was good too -- more chocolatey than red velvet though, which is a good thing to me.  I would definitely return if we come back to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for our anniversary and am so glad we did. This restaurant is so cozy and the service was amazing! Started with a cocktail at the bar then was seated shortly after. We shared the oysters appetizer and stuffed calamari. I enjoyed the lobster with the fish and my husband had the filet. We ended with the beignets. Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and a great place for an intimate dinner with close friends. Nothing crazy mind glowingly delicious, but I highly recommend if you haven't been. Great for family or in-laws when they come to town."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last night for our one year wedding anniversary. We had reservations for 8:30 but came early to have a drink at the bar first.  The staff is amazing and the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. It is very romantic and cozy. We were seated 15 minutes before our reservation upstairs in a little room. It was perfect. Our waitress, Ashley was wonderful and our dinner was outstanding and memorable. We each had the filet mignon with a feared salad, and it was definitely the best steak either of us have ever had.  We had the beignets for desserts and they even wrote 'happy anniversary' in chocolate in the plate.   If you are looking for the perfect place for a special occasion, or just a really nice, really good meal, this place is amazing. Wow!"}
{"text":"So I couldn't help but read some negative reviews on this place early in the day yesterday... they were disheartening as I had specifically chosen this for birthday dinner with my girls... All of my fears were laid to rest from the moment I arrived!  I showed up early for our reservation and was seated VERY promptly.  Water was poured, and I ordered a cocktail... I'm a bourbon girl, so the \"Thirst and How\" with Bulleit sounded like just the thing... and it was!    The weather was super nice yesterday evening, so we asked if we could have our table transferred to the porch/patio... it was done in a flash without so much as a flicker of an eyelash... I'm telling you... the service here is spectacular. They make you feel RIGHT at home!  We all selected our orders for the night (I got the scallops on couscous which is served with a salad... I asked for the spinach salad with goat cheese...) and delicious bread was brought out along with a little dish of pureed roasted garlic... WOW!  That garlic along with the rosemary olive oil on the table and the sea salt crust on the top of the bread... le YUM!!  The spinach salad was delightful... tossed in a light dressing with big chunks of bacon and lovely tufts of goat cheese... the whole thing was so delicious, I could've eaten a mixing bowl full of it!  The scallops were perfectly cooked, crusted on the top but not overly done... the bed of couscous was spicy and cooked with chorizo, and there was a little bit of asparagus on top... The dish was delightful... but I had to have the last bit boxed up to save room for DESSERT!!!  I had the dark chocolate torte... I have no words for it... just go...   If you are super fussy about paying good money now and then to eat GOOD food well prepared, then sure... you're going to feel like this place is an expense, because (and here's the truth) it IS an expensive restaurant... but (and I mean this with all of my heart) it's WORTH IT!  From the service, to the atmosphere, to the wine and cocktail offerings, to the well prepared, delicious food, to the last scrape of fork to plate... this is an experience well worth paying for!  Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"We are dinner here last night as our kickoff dinner for a department mini-summit. It was the perfect place for such a meal.   We had an upstairs room just for our party of eleven, and an incredible server named Curt who was kind, friendly, and very knowledgeable about the menu, the vast wine selection, and the restaurant itself.  We ordered one of each appetizer to share across the table, and then most of us ordered the Elk Chop for entrees. As a lover of great steak, I must confess that I was pleasantly surprised with how rich and full of flavor this cut of meat was.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"FIG TREE RESTAURANT- was absolutely fantastic. We went for my Birthday, this is defiantly a hidden gem in Charlotte. Very Romantic setting, friendly waitstaff.  We both had the ribeye which was very tender and seasoned perfectly, every bite left you wanting more.  The dish was served with Char and a cream sauce with mushrooms that was good as well. in addition to the meal we opted to add on a lobster tail which was just okay.  We finished dinner with cheesecake which was overrated for the price.  This is defiantly a Special Occasion or a Fancy Date night kind of place, very pricey."}
{"text":"This is the best Charlotte has to offer. The food is always spectacular and the services matches. I never had a bad meal there, it is perfect for any special occasion. I look forward to returning.  Read More at http://eatitcharlotte.com/2016/09/27/the-fig-tree/"}
{"text":"I love it here! I've always had a superior experience, outstanding service, and incredible food.   The Fig Tree really is a gem to find!!! It's sometimes hard for me to find really good vegetarian food, so I almost skipped coming here altogether.  I decided to try something new. The chef is amazing!!  They have made 3 amazing pasta dishes that have really better than any Italian restaurant I've been to in clt.  Completely off the menu. They aim to please!! I love it!!   Sam is definitely someone to request! Incredible waitress!! She remembered everything from my first order! She continues to impress me with each visit remembering minor, but important details.   This last time the bread and butter were fantastic!! It has rosemary and herbs on top. It comes with a garlic Schmeer. The Schmeer was not something I liked. You can ask for butter. It comes in a creamed swirl. Excellent taste!    Beat carpaccio - excellent! I thought it could use a little less pesto and if it was a little thicker beat there would be more flavor. I requested no goat cheese.   Potato & Pepper Soup - Incredible, with just the right amount of heat!   Cesar - the Romane and balsamic vinegar dressing - by request. So good!!  House salad - my friend enjoyed it! She loves there handmade croutons.   Pasta - I'm a vegetarian and requested something similar to an Alfredo sauce. This was OMG Good!!! It was made off-the-cuff. This is an incredible chef!!  I will definitely be back.   The last time I came the chef made a Pene a la vodka with the house made noodle, Pappardelle. This was outstanding! This is by far the best Italian pasta I've had in Charlotte!   Lobster risotto salmon - is definitely something to get when you visit. My friend got this and absolutely loved it!!!  Speckled trout - On Special -  My friend loved it. It was thick and perfect to the taste! It's her new favorite.    Bass -  On Special - Wasn't her favorite, probably wouldn't order it again.   Halibut on special w/ tomatoes, mushroom risotto - a close call to the stripped Bass that's my friends all time favorite - so really good!   Beignet for desert were incredible and the gelato, I switched the coffee gelato another. Best gelato / ice cream in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  So romantic and the food was delicious!  We tapped into our adventurous side and tried the Ostrich, it was super tasty!  Our waiter Michael was fantastic. This is the perfect date night spot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. The halibut piccata is one of my favorites.  Appetizer are worth saving room for. My husband normally orders steak and that is also great.  If you want a great dinner with super service, go here.  I call this a treat.  We have now been there 4 times in very short period of time.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Really the only reason this place didn't get a 5Th star was because of the price of the food.  This place has a very nice atmosphere, and a very fancy feel to it.  The food itself is excellent, especially the mashed potatoes.  It was all full of flavor and cooked perfectly.  The service was good, not quite as excellent as you would expect from the high prices, but still better than some places."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, mediocre food.  Yeah, that's right, I said the food wasn't so great. They may serve very unusual dishes (elk, ostrich, etc) but that doesn't matter much if they overcook my salmon. Seemed like an amateur mistake for such a classy place. Fortunately, I'm not a gastronome.  I came for the ambiance, and on that front they delivered. Our initial preference was to eat outside, but a festival in the park across the street made that impossible. Inside and upstairs they have a slice of old southern luxury. We wallowed in it - the perfect place to say goodbye to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome cheese plate. Service is over the top good."}
{"text":"I went here for a Christmas dinner, and we had a private room for our party.  The servers were excellant.  I ordered the sea scallaps and the butterstoch creme brulee.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  One of the better places that I have eaten in Charlotte so far."}
{"text":"Triple CouplesNight Done Right I've had this place Bookmarked in Yelp for a while now and planned to check it out many of moons ago (about 2 years) for one of my husband and I DateNights. However we always end up trying another cool place we saw or read about. After a nice girlsnight out with two Beautiful ladies from our neighborhood (turned friends) and taking on the responsibility of setting up a couples DateNight to allow our husbands to meet in a awesome married couples setting, I made reservations via OpenTable for FigTree for a party of 6. My husband and I were so excited and as we approached we admired the look of newness of the house. We enjoy eating in the South in homes turned restaurants and always admire the Architecture of the homes. It could be a little confusing if you've eat at places like Cajun queen or The Fish market when it comes to where to enter. The entrance is on the side of the building off the parking lot and not in the front. Upon entering that stairwell to the right will take you to the upstairs for additional dining space as well as the restrooms and one of the three wine cellars.The hostess stand is directly at the foot of the stairway.  We were welcomed and we sorta noticed one of the couples already seated so we announced that we were here for my party and see that some guest were seated so we can make our way over. The hostess was pleasant and agreed. Upon seating our server Curt came over to provide menus for my husband and I and took our drink order. Curt was a very honest, informative and pleasant server to say the least. As we waited on the other guest we decided to order an appetizer, we ordered the scallops with Apple Jalepeno chutney and whipped sweet potato. it was so delicious, my husband and I devoured it. I had the grapefruit martini, the other ladies did as well it was just the right amount of kick from grapefruit and the right pinch of liquor. Curt went over the specials and my husband and I decided on our main course. I went with the Sea Bass with Lobster on the menu and my husband has the Snapper special.  The other couples has the Grouper, The Salmon added Lobster, Scallops and Salads. The entrees come with a salad which was a tasty salad to say the least, the only offset is when my husband got down to the lower end of his salad where you can see the plate he also saw a piece of straight Black Hair which threw him off and he didn't finish his salad. He informed Curt and Curt took it away and apologized and even cracked a joke about the salad guy being bald to help lighten the mood.   My SeaBass was the BEST item at the table in my opinion and I would gladly come back to have it again. I gave my husband a piece and he shared a piece of his Snapper with me BUT wanted more of my SeaBass and he kept eyeing it across the table saying \"That is AMAZING\". We ordered the Beignets for dessert as it comes with 4 however Curt said he can customize any dish and he didn't misspeak at all. He add 2 more Beignets in order to allow everyone to have one at the table. We ate it so fast and it was so good we ordered another order of 6 :-)  We will be back and will thoroughly check our salads before devouring them to ensure NO HAIR.."}
{"text":"I had really high expectations about this place so maybe I'm being a bit unfair with only 3 stars.   The good: The ambience is very unique and unlike most any place in Charlotte. It's very cozy and romantic. The level of service and just the correct amount of attention was superb. The drinks and wine were very good. Some of the food was unbelievably good and some was just not seasoned well.  The bad: Well the reason I want to dine in establishments such as this is mainly for the food. The food was inconsistent from start to finish yet it's one of the more expensive places I've been.  Foie gras and stuffed calamari for apps...both were ok but nothing special. For the price charged I felt it lacked greatness.  Filet...one of the best ever tasted. Sides were unbelievable. Grouper and lobster...grouper and risotto were under seasoned. The lobster was really good.  Beignets...really good and had French press coffee to finish the evening.  Bottom line is that we paid a steep price for an inconsistent meal. The parts that were good were extremely good."}
{"text":"Fantastic all the way around...  Decor and ambiance was excellent... We sat on the patio and it was a little chilly but heaters provided the needed heat  Service - everything was professional. Everything was explained and they where attentive at every turn  Food.  Our party of four had a little of everything -  I had ostrich - well prepared great taste Wife had the fish special perfect Our friends the elk and fish / lobster... We all had bites and the food was amazing Dessert - shared 3 and they where all good... Finished with a port   Satisfying and the price was well worth it... I will be back when I'm in Charlotte...."}
{"text":"Can't think of one thing to complain about at our amazing dinner at the Fig Tree last night.  We were celebrating my birthday, and from start to finish, they made it so special!  First and foremost, the bottles of wine are so reasonably priced, which was a nice surprise.  We started with escargot.  Delicious, and very rich in a gorgonzola cream sauce.  It was just enough.  Be sure to get extra bread for that sauce!  We then had our salads.  Both good, nothing to write home about, but solid.  I then had the grouper with lobster tail over saffron risotto. It was unbelievable.  Extremely rich but oh so amazing.  The perfect birthday dinner.  My husband had filet mignon, and the meat was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  Both entrees were five star, for sure.  We capped off our meal with the biegnets.  We subbed out the coffee gelato for buttermilk gelato and my god, they were unbelievable.  I would go back just for dessert!  All in all, service, food, and ambiance were outstanding.  We WILL be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant - I felt transported to one of my favorite restaurants ever, Poogan's Porch in Charleston, SC, since the Fig Tree is located in a beautiful old Southern style house. All food was delicious (trout, rabbit, beignets), portions were good. Service was friendly and for the price level the place didn't feel snooty. We stuck with the lower-priced wine and entrees and had a fantastic time. We plan on coming back on the next special occasion. And yes: Even if fried food scares you a little, try the beignets. They are delicious.  My only criticism is that it can get a little noisy since tables are in various small rooms. My husband and I were seated rather far apart on an awkwardly long table and had two rather loud groups at adjacent tables. Try asking for a quiet spot when making a reservation - maybe it works."}
{"text":"3 1/2 Stars   Loved the atmosphere! We sat at the bar first and had a cocktail to get started, although this seemed to have been frowned upon because we were getting the look to sit and eat!! Nevertheless we sat in time of our reservation and enjoyed ourselves!!  We had started with the Cheese Plate and Scallop with Chorizo, Carrot, and a Maple Butter. The Cheese plate was lacking and not my favorite cheese plate in town. However the Scallop was really well prepared, it was cooked just right and the flavors were great!!  For my Entree I had the Halibut with Lobster and Lobster Butter with Asparagus It was cooked good and I ate everything on my plate, but I just felt like it was missing some flavor. My Friends also had the Halibut and  the Wahoo Special which was over cooked but tasty!!  All in all this was a good meal the server was great (Ty) and suggested great wine! I would come again and get that Scallop!! I just wasn't Wowed"}
{"text":"I have dined at the Fig Tree with my wife on numerous occasions and have always been pleased with the quality of the food, the service, and the atmosphere. Whenever my wife and I can get a sitter the Fig Tree is where we prefer to dine. By far our favorite restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The best restaurant I have been to in Charlotte so far. The staff was very helpful and professional. The menu is very unique and if you're a foodie this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Nice high-end restaurant situated in a old, historic house in a neighborhood. Parking around the house, but it fills up. No problem, plenty of street parking available.  Interesting and diverse menu. New Zealand elk, foie gras. I came to this restaurant because I love seared foie gras.  $20 for a 3 inch piece of seared foie gras. Pricey, but foie gras is like a taste of Heaven. Unfortunately my order was nicely seared on the outside but Ice cold on the inside. The server graciously offered to take it back to the kitchen for reheating, so of course I accepted her kind offer. When it came back, I swear the piece was much smaller , but the server was sure it was the same piece. Well, the reheated piece was excellent. I just wish I had  not eaten half of a cold foie Gras. It really destroyed that experience.  The elk was delicious. It was medium rare, mostly just as I ordered, except the pieces close to the Bone were rare bordering Raw.  Zinfandel was very reasonably priced, but average  quality. I would have preferred to pay more for a good one. And good wine would be expected for a place like this.  This could and should easily be a five-star restaurant and review. The hiccups were small, and were just the bad cards I drew that evening. I would not hesitate to return, to give them another try."}
{"text":"My husband and I showed up 30 minutes early for our reservation with the idea that we would just sit at the bar for a bit, but they had a table ready, and we were seated promptly.  The service was amazing with friendly servers and hostesses. The food was amazing, just amazing. I got one of the specials (veal osso bucco), and it was perfectly prepared. We also both got soup with our entrees, and while I wasn't completely confident in celery heart and apple soup, I was blown away when the meal was served.  In another city, the same service, food, atmosphere and drinks would have been 2x more expensive. It was well worth the money and time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing!! Both the food and the ambience were A++. Immediately after we left I told my husband this was where I wanted to go for our next special occasion. I had lamb chops which were amazing. I tried the dishes the other three people in our party ordered and they were amazing as well! LOVE IT!! Sooo excited to go back!"}
{"text":"This is the best fine dining restaurant in Charlotte and maybe the best one I've ever eaten at anywhere. The service was great. The food left nothing to be desired. We started with the escargot absolutely the best sauce I've ever had. She had a house salad and I had a Caesar salad. They were fantastic! My entrée was the halibut and lobster tail over black Chinese rice. One of the best dishes I have ever had anywhere. She had the fillet mignon and was very pleased. I don't remember our servers name but she is a professional dog walker in the daytime. I would very much recommend this place for any special dinner. The total price was less than I expected"}
{"text":"Celebrated my anniversary here with my wife. The service was excellent, they greeted us by congratulating us, the set up was very nice, and the escargot was ridiculously good. We both ordered filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. Our server was great with the recommendations and our dessert plates were decorated well and were delicious. Thank you Fig Tree!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best dining experience we have had in Charlotte. The food and service were impeccable. Eddie is an amazing waiter, we want to thank him for making our anniversary dinner so special. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The Fig Tree is one of those restaurants in Charlotte you reserve for a special occasion or night out. It's not a cheap dinner, but the food and service are excellent, so expect to spend a little more and enjoy the slower paced meal. Expect to start with homemade focaccia bread, while perusing through the never ending wine list. Or, they have some great craft cocktails if that is your preference as well.  You'll have your choice of appetizers, with choices like carpaccios' (veal or beef), octopus, escargot, stuffed calamari, foi gras or a cheese plate. On this occasion (our two year wedding anniversary), we decided on the chorizo stuffed calamari. I'm a Rhode Island girl and a huge fan of the legit fried stuff, but these calamari come more authentic. If you've never tasted the rubbery squid, here's your chance. Filled with chorizo and eggplant with a red pepper puree, this dish is a memorable one. Great way to start the night.  When you're at Fig Tree, you should be aware that the Elk Chop is one of the highest rated meals in Charlotte (https://www.thrillist.com/eat/charlotte/best-things-to-eat-in-charlotte-food-bucket-list). And why not? It's a 14oz of a double-cut elk chop with horseradish spaetzle, braised red cabbage with smoky bacon, and a classic Boursin-Dijon sauce. Not only is a gorgeous site, it's very delicious. I can't remember ever having elk before, but it has no gaminess taste to it whatsoever. This was very flavorful and I'd definitely go back and order it again. We also ordered the salmon, which was cooked and flavored well. It's hard to compare another entree to the elk chop, but know that you'll get a delicious meal, overall. A side salad comes with your entree, and you can upgrade to a caesar salad or spinach salad for $3.00 additional.   Don't miss the dessert menu either. The beignets seem to be what I always order, but they do make their own ice cream in house. I was eyeing the dark chocolate brownie bar for next time.   The Fig Tree does a great job of making you feel welcomed and respected, while not going over the top fancy. I find that it's the perfect balance and definitely worth checking out if you live in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent! The care they put into preparing each dish is outstanding. The ambiance is also very pleasant, and the service is awesome. This is a great place to take that special someone to celebrate those special moments. Definitely need to put this place on your dinner destination list!"}
{"text":"Wow.  What a disappointment.  This used to be my and my wife's favorite in town.  We have had 2 not just bad but extremely terrible experiences in a row and will never go back.  It would take me a long time to describe the details of everything so I'll just provide the hi(low)lights.     The next to last time we went we were there for a celebration.  It was horrible and I'll leave it at that.  I'll focus on the last time we went.    For dinner I went with my wife, sister in law and mother in law for Mother's Day.  It wasn't overly crowded so there is no excuse for what was to come.  My wife ordered a very nice bottle of wine which when poured out hand a very strange amber color to it.  We are not wine snobs but knew there was something wrong.  And it was wrong.  The wine tasted terrible.  It was like we were drinking a cheap sherry.  The waitress said it looked normal.   I will say that the appetizers were very good.  Cheese/charcuterie plate and scallops were very good.  When it got to the entrees things went significantly downhill.  I ordered the filet and it tasted like the chef put zero seasoning on it.  It was cooked properly but tasted like a frozen steak with no seasoning from a bad grocery store.  My sister in laws pasta (she's a vegetarian) was practically inedible.  Not sure how you screw that up.  My mother in law got the fish special and the result was sour vegetables and a dried out tasteless fish.  My wife's experience was the worst. She ordered sea bass with lobster.  When it came out the lobster was cold. When she asked them to redo it the waitress took it back to the kitchen and came back 7-10 minutes later.  My guess is that they threw it in the microwave or under the heat lamp.  The sea bass and vegetables were now dry and shrunken.  She ate none of it.  When the waitress came to take our plates she made no mention of the fact that the 4 of us hardly ate anything.    Really disappointing because while charlotte has very few go to restaurants that are reliable I thought this was one of them.  Will never, ever return."}
{"text":"The fig tree has won a spot on my top favorite restaurants. I went for my birthday with two other people. Being the birthday girl, I had a taste of everything that was ordered. Unbelievable food and really good wine. The elk chops and lobster crab cheesecake where my favorite. The tomato bisque was heaven. The carrot cake dessert made me weak in the knees. I can't say enough good things about the food here. So worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal here tonight, our second visit over the past year. The food is fantastic; it is very high quality, freshly prepared with local ingredients and presented nicely; the menu is not particularly expansive, but combines some very traditional items with some new-American choices. Tonight we had the elk chops ($42) and grouper  + lobster ($42). The beignets are a fantastic dessert ($8). Service is well above average but a little short of excellent. Definitely one of the priciest places to eat in Charlotte, but a very nice treat to enjoy when the occasion demands. We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Fig Tree last night to celebrate us moving to Charlotte from NYC and a new job, and we had such an exquisite dining experience. The atmosphere is beautiful and peaceful, with a southern charm. I had the veal and my husband had the special. My veal was so flavorful and cooked to perfection. My husband also enjoyed his special. We got the escargot and cheese board for an appetizer. Escargot is a must have. What made the experience 5 stars was our server, who was outstanding. Incredibly knowledgeable about the cheese selection, and helped us pick out our entrees without just saying \"it's all good\"....I hate when a waiter does that. He really took his time with us and made our night very special. Thank you for the experience, we will be returning."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night and had such a wonderful time! The atmosphere is classy yet cozy being it's an older home converted into a fine dining establishment. I love that we were seated upstairs in a room with only a couple of other tables, so it allowed a romantic ambiance... especially with the soft jazz playing. Even though my steak was accidentally overdone [yet it's flavor was still absolutely delicious!!!] the staff went above and beyond to make things right. Speaking of staff, they are great. Our servers were very attentive, courteous, didn't rush us, answered any menu questions along with offered perfect suggestions for food substitutes and drink pairings. Thank you guys!  I definitely recommend The Fig Tree to anyone who hasn't been here yet! Sure it's pricey, but this place certainly makes it worth it- unlike most other places here in Charlotte. I cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Five stars for The Fig Tree! My husband and I were visiting Charlotte NC for a cousins wedding and it happened to be our third wedding anniversary as well so I had to make a nice reservation for dinner. I am glad I found The Fig Tree while researching!  The service here is fantastic and it just adds to the quality all around because the food is excellent down to the bread and butter!  I tried Foie Gras for the first time and I loved it. I hope I can find it as good again in Boston! The Elk is a must have. So delicious and not all gamy.  This is the perfect spot for a celebration,thanks for making our 3rd anniversary memorable!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are from Rhode Island and we were in Charlotte for 4 days.  We wanted to go out to a nice restaurant while we were here and we found the Fig Tree restaurant.  Not only was the food amazing but the service was outstanding.  We had the filet mignon and the grouper with lobster tail and both dishes were incredible and full of a variety of flavors.  We've never had such an incredible meal.  Rich was our server and he was amazing, he was polite ,knowledgeable about the menu and extremely attentive, and he had a great personality to top it off.  Dustin was the server assistant on that night ,and he was also exceptional , he was on top of water and bread service, and you could tell he was doing everything he could to help Rich. We highly recommend dining at the Fig Tree!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! The decor was very cute and intimate in a repurposed house. The service was excellent - attentive without being intrusive and waiter gave great recommendations. We started with the scallops which were so good we had to order a second one. I had a lobster bisque which was good but I always think they have less lobster than I want and finally had the pork chops which was well seasoned and cooked. Wine selection was great but I went while I was pregnant so didn't actually try any. It is an upper scale restaurant so expect to pay around 100$ per person for appetizer, entree and drink. If that's not something you do day to day, it is still a great place to go for a special occasion. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Fine dining atmosphere, service, quality yet not pretentious and snobby.  Extensive wine list.  We had stuffed pork chop, grouper w/lobster, Elk Chop, and Veal Chop.  All were outstanding and very generous portions. Their menu is very unique.  Dessert was creme brulee and beignets...also fabulous!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite restaurant in Charlotte until tonight. Don't get me wrong, food is still great, service is wonderful, can even beat some of the Michelin 3 star restaurants I have been to around the world. What's wrong? The hostess was wrong. I was sitting on patio and then I entered the house to use the bathroom. She didnot see me as I was sitting outside. So she told me I was NOT allowed to use the bathroom upstairs unless I was having dinner here. If this has always been your bathroom policy, then I suggest u change it to welcome potential guests, after all, it is not likely for someone who is not a local to find a bathroom in this neighborhood. If your bathroom policy has not always been guests only, then I suggest you fire the racist hostess because she apparently told me (after I repeatedly ask her if she was serious) such policy only because I am Asian."}
{"text":"We went this week and got mediocre food for the price. From the table: pasta was hard, sauce on the veal was gluey, can I get some salad dressing?, and elk unseasoned. I think the cooks put our food under the lamps and went home. I was disappointed that I took my family there for a treat."}
{"text":"I went to the fig tree last night to celebrate my boyfriend and I's engagement and the service was EXCELLENT. Top notch and a very extensive wine line as well. I got the filet mignon and my boyfriend got the lamb, both were 10/10. The ambience was intimate and perfect for the occasion."}
{"text":"This is my second dinner at the Fig Tree. The first was a business dinner and went off without a hitch.  The second was for my girlfriends birthday.  It was not what one should expect from a restaurant with a reputation like theirs.    Jamie ordered the escargot which was prepared perfectly.  Unfortunately the flavor profile just didn't work.  One bite was bland while the next was overwhelmingly acidic as the complimentary ingredients took too prominent a role.  I had the foie gras which was seared perfectly on one side and uncooked on the other leaving it cold on one side.  Truly disappointing.    Main course of veal was excellent except the potatoes were undercooked.  My lamb was bland and the risotto was perfectly cooked with good flavors.  Dessert was delightful but not enough to save the experience."}
{"text":"The wife and I have eaten here twice in the last year or so. Both times have been great. It seems like this place has a reputation as being a special occasion restaurant, and that was proven last night as everyone seemed to be having a birthday celebration around us. The first time, we sat inside on the second level, but last night we were on the covered porch facing 7th street. The idea of eating outside appeals to me, but rarely is Charlotte weather just right for the wife and I. I would sit outside in the snow while she would love the heat of the summer. The weather last night, while humid, was still pleasant for both of us so we had to do it. The service, like last time, was great and attentive. It always leads me to eat too much bread as they keep coming back to offer more. The bread was perfect to clean up all the sauce that came with the escargots that we shared as appetizer. For mains, the wife got the wreck fish special and I the salmon off the regular menu. Every component on my dish was flavorful and both fish were cooked perfectly. The wife did mention her overall dish was under seasoned, but hey we can all stand to eat a little sodium once in a while. We split some decaf french press coffee and the blackberry coffee cake to round out a great meal. Oh and I almost forgot the adult beverage choices. I just love their bourbon smash which is the perfect mixture of bourbon, maple and orange flavors. I really need to figure out their recipe. The wife got a Sancerre by the glass and loved it.  My advice to anyone, don't wait for your birthday. Get on over to Fig Tree and check it out!"}
{"text":"well prepared and delicious. We we're seated in essentially a private room upstairs. Great date spot."}
{"text":"Escargot, cheese plate for apps.  Delish.  Main courses- Grouper and Lobstah, Elk Chop, Duck and Chicken.  All exceptional.  Very quiet and historic place.  LOVED dining here.  We were all coming from various parts of the country and all of us were super impressed.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience. Gary our waiter possessed such class and his cadence in delivery was exceptional.  We had the cheesecake and 3 layer chocolate cake for dessert as well as French pressed coffee and while I am not giving it a fabulous description, trust me each dessert melted in our already indulged palates.  :) Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had a very nice mushro bisque with creme fraiche.  Bread was not particularly special nor was my dry aged new York strip which was 2-3 steps over cooked.  The fig tree has a slightly pretentious atmosphere given the modest surrounding area and facility.  I was expecting more but wasnt necessarily disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent service, romantic atmosphere (if you actually go with the right person)  as its a little nested lil cabin-like house. Everything is seasonal and fresh. The salmon was amazing.   The dishes are good, but not so much with a unique twist for the price."}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's birthday. Was very, very nice. Would definitely recommend for a special occasion as it is very pricey, but the service was excellent. We sat upstairs in a room that had three tables, but wish we had sat outside (that's our mistake, not theirs though) Had two drinks, their version of a Manhattan (The Bostic) was terrific, smokey and delicious. Wife had the Local Honey which was very tasty and the server recommended a glass of wine after finding out what type of wine my wife liked. Had the beet carpaccio for an appetizer, which was very good if a bit of a small portion, but it was very fresh and bright. I ordered the elk chop which was EXCELLENT and a must-get if you're there, wife ordered the lobster thermidor which was very good as well. Had the beignets for dessert and yes they wrote Happy Birthday in chocolate. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience, but now that we've been once, we probably will try somewhere else.   Definitely worth going to, though."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Charlotte! If we could afford it, we'd eat here every week...lol. Best filet I've ever had....for real. Best service I ever had. Best ambiance. A true meal to remember....no joke. Take someone you love & be prepared to spend like 2 bills...it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"A special brunch was held here for The Assistance League of Charlotte. Lovely home/restaurant. Santa was there! Had a lovely morning with my friends."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday. The restaurant itself is inside a house, and it feels like one once inside as well, but that's not a bad thing. We were seated upstairs in one of the rooms with two other small parties.   We tried several different dishes that were all very good. The staff were so extremely nice. As for the dessert, they elegantly scripted Happy Birthday on the plate, which was a very nice touch AND they also gave me a bonus dessert! They must know about me. Lol"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting The Fig Tree, nestled in the cozy Elizabeth neighborhood, with some friends in the evening this past year. Now, fine dining isn't typically my scene, but Fig Tree makes me take a second glance at the \"use your salad fork\" mantra.   The inside is incredible intriguing. It's an old house off of 7th street with tons of history. The historic Lucas House that was originally built in 1913 and boy it shows. However, it has been kept in immaculate condition. Definitely go explore both the 1st and 2nd floor. Lots of cool things to see.   The mini bar in the foyer is so rad. Only a few seat, one bartender, a small tv. Quaint and perfect.   We sat inside since it was a bit chilly. There is some outside seating, which would be fantastic for a spring/summer dining experience.   Apps: Apple Beggar's Purse was one of the most decadent and sought after dishes of the evening. Savory, sweet and addicting. The thyme butter sauce will make your taste buds deliriously happy.   Escargots were fantastic. Best I've had to date. Tender, garlic-filled bites of once shell-inhabiting morsels. Worth the try if they'll be your first.   Entrees: Lamb Chops were amazing. Cut was thick, flavor was smokey and rich. Cooked to perfection.   Ok, so I'm not typically a filet kind of guy, but The Fig Tree made me shut my skeptical mouth. Veal demi glace? Are you kidding me? WHOA. Also, topped with amazing cheese and a mushroom mixture that was sining in the foreground of your pallet the entire time.  Throughout the entire evening, service was professional, kind, witty, fun and helpful. Great staff. They hire and train well. These people know their stuff. The way it's supposed to be.   My hat's off to you, Fig Tree. You've made fine dining a pleasant experience and I look forward to saving up enough money to come back and visit you once more!"}
{"text":"My first visit to The Fig and I was not disappointed.   I loved cruising their wine list; full of variety and to find one of my favorite Spanish wines grown in the Priorat region was a must to order, and at a great  price. We ordered apps to share: the apple beggar's purse, duck confit with house made pasta and trumpet mushrooms, raw oysters three ways and the artisan cheese plate.  I did not get a bite of the purse but my companions devoured.  The duck confit: tender pieces of leg meat with al dente pasta in glacé--yum!  The best oyster of the three was napped in a bacon vinaigrette.  The other two tasty as well. My veal chop, moist tender and cooked as ordered was topped with capers and mushrooms in a light Demi accompanied by farro cooked perfectly, slightly over cooked  asparagus and two tender shrimp.  More than I could handle.  An entree of elk chop with braised red cabbage and bacon looked great.  The elk was extremely tender. I had to try a dessert so I chose the chocolate mousse with coffee gelato.  The mousse was glazed with chocolate ganache on top of a short cake style base and garnished with a house made pulled sugar ring.  Gorgeous presentation and backed up with creamy textures. The staff was very knowledgable to the menu, attentive and seen when needed and ghost-like during service: a trait not found often. Can't wait to go back again.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I really like the Veal.  In the area visiting and found this restaurant. Best meal I had on the road the last 2 weeks"}
{"text":"While I went here a while back, I knew I owed it to this place to write this review. On par with their reputation, The Fig Tree is not only serving up delicious meals, but is also providing fantastic overall dining experiences.   I took my wife here to celebrate our third wedding anniversary. Since we had spent our honeymoon and two other anniversaries at all inclusive Caribbean resorts, I knew I had to pick carefully. The Fig Tree had been on our list since we moved to Charlotte, and this seemed like as good of an occasion as any.  We started by ordering the escargot and talking with our server about wine. There is always this moment where you wonder if the waiter is going to attempt to up-sell you on wine and push one of their more expensive bottles. However, after a casual 5 minute conversation where he listened to our tastes and likes, our waiter pointed to a bottle that was in the middle of the road in price that nailed the exact flavors which we were seeking. We were also amazed that his knowledge of wine rivaled that of most sommeliers! This helped set the ambiance for the rest of the evening.  Moving to the food, the escargot was incredible and served in a Gorgonzola cream sauce. I'm certainly guilty of dipping our side of bread in the sauce more than a few times. I had a local white fish dish and my wife ordered the fillet. While my fish was wonderful, the fillet was cooked perfectly. To finish the meal, we split the brownie, red velvet, cheesecake dessert. Overall everything we ordered was exquisite.   Beyond the meal, what blew me away here was both the service and the pacing of the meal. Appetizers, wine, main meals, and desserts flowed in and out with ease and I never had a single moment where I felt either rushed or wondering where the next course was. Also the character of the 100+ year old house created both a charming and romantic atmosphere. While driving away, both my wife and I were rendered speechless by the evening and still agree to this day that it was one of the best meals we have ever had. I certainly plan on being back, but am a little hesitant as I don't want anything to taint the memory of that evening. I love the high quality meals and experiences this place is turning out and appreciate that they helped my wife and I turn our anniversary into a night we will not forget."}
{"text":"I brought my wife here for an anniversary dinner.  What an excellent experience. The food was exquisite. The ambience is intimate. Highly recommend for a romantic dinner setting."}
{"text":"Outstanding Easy elegance. Great dinner, loved the quail appetizer, wine selection, and wow the Banana Upside Down Cake was out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, mostly attentive staff and food was so so. Felt for the price the food was a little underwhelming. Had the elk chop, not that great. Wished I had had a different dish."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 4 year anniversary here and it was absolutely incredible! Their wine list was fabulous and very extensive. We learned that the owner used to live in Napa and because of the relationships he built there he is able to offer wines at a reasonable price. We had a bottle of 2013 Nickle and Nickle and it was delicious! For dinner we had the Elk Chop, Lamb Chop, and for an appetizer we had the seasonal Apple Beggars Purse. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Our waitress was very pleasant and knowledgeable of the restaurant. We look forward to going again soon."}
{"text":"Ridiculous!! This restaurant is the absolute best in town for fine dining!  If you haven't been, I highly recommend.   My wife and I went to the Fig Tree for a nice dinner prior to going to see a play.  I ordered the Elk Chop and she had the Stripped Bass on risotto. Both dishes were to die for!  We started out with the cheese plate which I would recommend. The chefs really know what their doing.   Many comments say the price is too high. I disagree, it is about right when comparing higher class restaurants."}
{"text":"Had to try this place out while we were in Charlotte. It was on multiple lists of best restaurants in the area. Easy reservations via Open Table. We got there on Sunday for dinner - parking in the side lot or on the side street. The place is super charming and quaint. With a wrap around porch with additional seating, there were plenty of options for your dining preferences. It is a converted home so don't expect your typical restaurant setup.   They start you off with some delicious bread and garlic spread. They serve individual pieces of bread at a time and are very efficient in refilling your empty side dish when you're done. We started with the stuffed calamari. This was delicious - the chorizo was very flavorful with just enough heat and the calamari was tender. The accompanying sauces worked very well with each bite.  The salads were just meh for me. I was excited to try their Caesar/balsamic dressing but was a bit unimpressed. I ordered the parpadelle and my bf ordered the infamous elk. I thought I saw on yelp I could ask for a spicy vodka sauce but our waiter said no, they didn't do that. Pasta was still delicious and super flavorful chock full of veggies but I would've liked to have tried their pink sauce. My bf really enjoyed his elk - not having ever had it before, he thought it was delicious, not gamey at all and cooked perfectly.  All in all, we really enjoyed our experience and would definitely visit again if in the area. Our waiter, Kurt was amazing. Great personality and very informative. Great place to check out if in the area."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!! I would have to say that Fig Tree is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  I came here for a work dinner and had the luxury of sampling various items. For appetizers, we started off with the chorizo stuffed calamari, apple beggar's purse, pumpkin crusted sea scallops, and 6 specialty oysters. The scallops were my favorite, as they had a velvety texture and melted in your mouth.  The next course was a house salad, which greatly differed from your typical \"house salad\".  It included hearts of palm, tomatoes, cucumbers, pine nuts, homemade croutons and freshly grated parmigiano with a housemade herb vinaigrette.  Now for the main course...I was torn over what to choose, as I read many mixed reviews about the elk chop.  Well, I had to try it for myself and boy am I glad that I did.  I ordered it rare and it was cooked to PERFECTION (I rarely, if ever, say this as many chefs overcook it when you request \"rare\").  The elk chop is served over a boursin-dijon sauce and is served with a generous portion of horseradish spaetzle and smoked bacon-braised purple cabbage. This dish is a must-try!! For dessert, we feasted on the beignets served with cinnamon creme anglaise and coffee ice cream and the chocolate fudge came with spiced cream cheese frosting, dark chocolate chili truffles, black cherry coulis, and parmigiano ice cream.  Despite everyone being full, the desserts quickly vanished and the plates were scraped clean! The pairing of the chocolate cake with the dark chocolate chili truffles and parmigiano ice cream is ingenious and the taste is almost indescribable. To tie it all together the ambiance and wonderful service (we had Jennifer who was amazing!!!!) makes this place a step above everything else in Charlotte."}

{"text":"Took my wife for our 26th wedding anniversary because I had heard good things. We are new to the area, travel a lot and enjoy fine dining. The food was very good and our waiter was very professional, but I was embarrassed after the restaurant was out of the vintage port my wife ordered with desert after dinner.  When the waiter came back to the table to say they were out of the port she wanted, my wife asked if she could have the next higher-priced vintage port for the same price as the one she ordered. I would have gladly paid for the higher priced port but respect my wife's decision to make this request. Based on the dollar amount of our bill and the inventory management mistake on the part of the restaurant, I figured this was an easy yes. Instead, the waiter returned to our table and said the manager declined our request. I asked the waiter to bring my bill and he could see my wife and I were upset. He later came back to the table and comp'd my wife with a glass of the next-lower priced port. Two wrong decisions by the manager. Nobody died and we will be OK, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I had a great first impression of Fig Tree. We sat at the bar waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. While browsing the wine list, the bartender gave us tastes of several of their by-the-glass whites. They were all tasty; it was a great introduction to the restaurant.  Their menu got me interested too. It has things like escargots, lamb in phyllo, and elk. Unfortunately, things started to unravel when the food came to the table. The creamy sauce that surrounded the escargots just didn't work for me. The Lamb Wellington was inexcusably bland. The elk just seemed to lack flavor (it came nowhere close to the same dish at Circa 1886 in Charleston).  The best thing we order was the trout, which was rich and delicious. The potato gratin cakes that accompanied the fillet mignon and the elk were also yummy. The desserts were good too. We got a very good standard creme brulee and cinnamon-sugar beignets, which were good but not traditional.  I considered giving Fig Tree two stars instead of three--some of the food was just not good and we did send back a muscles appetizer that had some off flavors--but the wine list, the ambiance, and the desserts were great. Maybe you're better off sticking to just drinks and sweets at Fig Tree."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal at The Fig Tree this past weekend. Nicole was our sever and she was extremely knowledgable about the menu and offered great suggestions in terms of wine pairing. She's been there for seven years and really knows her stuff. We started with warm bread which was served with whipped butter and a garlic spread. Word to wise- go easy on the garlic. It's potent. Then we shared the scallop appetizer and the foie gras- both were very good. I started with a Pinot Noir and she had a Pinot Gris. We loved the spinach salad with the quail egg and bacon and maple vinaigrette. We added the goat cheese, because you know, it's goat cheese. What shouldn't it be on? She had the filet- huge, super rare, awesome. I had the duck. Loved the duck, but wished for more sweet potato and fewer beans. I stuck with my Pinot and my wife ended up with a great Grenache which was the best of the evening and surprisingly inexpensive. For dessert we shared the flourless chocolate cake. Rich. Dark. Just right. In all, we had a great evening and will definitely return. Tip: sitting upstairs puts you close to the restaurant's only restroom. The down side? Steps. Lots of them."}
{"text":"What a fine establishment.  Food and drinks are spectacular.  Service seems to always be good here.  Easy parking!    Cool spot to visit during my Charlotte business trip, good place to impress any potential clients."}
{"text":"I know, I know, I know: only 3 stars with such glowing reviews.  The Fig Tree absolutely nails it on service, ambiance, and wine selection.  Thank you Zack for your expert care of my wife and I as we celebrated her birthday.  The evening could not have been nicer.  The elk was cooked perfectly and is a definite repeat.    However . . . for starters we ordered a sausage-stuffed calamari, and a grilled octopus with an eggplant ragu.  With both dishes the star ingredient was lost.  The sausage overwhelmed the delicate squid and the octopus was buried under a pile of muddled flavors.  Having spent time grazing around the Mediterranean, these appetizers did not deliver on any level.  Lastly, my wife ordered the trout and commented it was over-cooked and mushy.   After tasting it, I agreed (fortunately there was plenty of elk, so she didn't leave hungry)!  Score 1-0 for red meat, but 0-3 on seafood.  I'm OK with top prices but not while batting a paltry .250 average."}
{"text":"I love you. End of story."}
{"text":"Not one negative comment. The building appears impeccably taken care of. The service top notch. I had the lamb chops and husband had the elk. They were both excellent. Impressive wine list. Perfect place for my big 5-0 celebration!"}
{"text":"Hiding behind a quaint and cozy ambiance of a restaurant situated in an old house, you will experience the over-priced and mediocre food of The Fig Tree Restaurant.   The service was...interesting. The wait staff seemed mentally preoccupied and our waiter in particular was difficult to understand. Sitting outside on the front porch (they like to refer to it as the covered dining area) was great. Loved the vibe out there.   The menu is small, which was promising for me. I was very excited to finally be trying this place. I ordered the heart of ribeye special and it was a joke. The polenta was done as it should be, and the fig demi-glacé had a nice flavor, but the meat was just off; way overcooked and very tough.   My girlfriend ordered the salmon and at $36 I expected something that was at least a decent sized portion. Instead, she got a quarter sized piece of a salmon filet, situated on top of some basic risotto. Our salads were not impressive either. My spinach tasted and smelled kind of old.   Overall, a pretty disappointing experience. I'm not quite sure how they managed #2 in the \"Top 50 Restaurants of Charlotte\" list. I would rather go spend $200 on a meal of delicious small plates before going back to Fig Tree. Not the worst meal I've ever had, but way overpriced for what you get and really missing the mark in some simple areas. Truly a 3/5; mediocre."}
{"text":"Good service Jacob was our waiter and he was on point. Tough thick starter bread Didn't care for the garlic butter served with the bread. Salad was a good portion and the dressing was light and flavorful. The croutons on the other hand were hard rocks and unpleasant.  The wine list is extensive and impressive. We started with the pic poul font-mars, was a tastefully light start. We ate outside and I didn't care for the dirty ceiling and ceiling fan. I kept worrying about the wind blowing the caked on dust off the fan and into my meal. My lamb was cooked more medium well as opposed to the medium rare I ordered. I had to have it sent back and new one cooked. The new one was amazing. Also the chef took care of us in the bill for that.  To touch the point of service again, it was amazing. Erica they manager was a great manager and wonderful person to talk to about the meal.  Dessert was the cheesecake and carrot cake. The cheesecake was light and more of a cream cheese taste. Random but even the way the towels were folded in the mens restroom impressed me."}
{"text":"We had the escargot appetizer, sea scallops, and NY strip. For dessert we had the chocolate silk torte which was delicious! Oh and the garlic bread was phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! The service was great and personable, and the restaurant has a cool ambiance.  It is expensive, but well worth the money. I would definitely recommend this to people."}
{"text":"Get gussied up for a fancy night out! Perfect ambiance to impress your date or your guests in a charming old home. You did not see a sore face in the whole place - looking around you could see friends, families, colleagues all in good conversation...kind of felt like the background of a movie with everyone dressed up and having a nice evening. This is what fine dining is all about.  Let's talk dessert first and then go backwards. Save room for an order of beignets to share! Pair a bite or two of those with a toasted almond cappuccino and you can call it a night. For the main course, I ordered the sea scallops with a mixed salad. I love scallops and these were made well and melted like butter in my mouth. Hubs got the night special and although I can't remember what that was as I'm typing this, I do remember he slicked his plate clean.    The service was great. We never felt rushed, they treated us like guests, and they were friendly.  From the moment we moved to Charlotte almost 6 years ago, we heard great things about this restaurant. Can't believe it took us so long, but so glad we did."}
{"text":"Wow food is exquisite  good. Flavors. Awesome service  and. The bartender. The best I ever have drinks. Right  on point  about the. Food. We had the carpaccio and the octopus and is rare to find a place that serves a well done octopus this was divine. I had. Veal chop really tender and full of flavor  she got. The sea scallops. Fresh and cooked. Just. Right. When you have good and fresh products like the fig tree has. You don't have to do much. Just Coke it right and. You guys nailed thanks again. You on my top rest in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'd rate this place 4.5 stars if Yelp would let me. The short version: The appetizer, main course and dessert where delicious. The side dishes and the service left something to be desired. Overall, your experience can vary greatly depending on your server. The food is solid and worth a visit.  The long version: Hubby and I went to celebrate our anniversary. The note was made on our reservation so we were congratulated upon checking in. We ordered the Escargot for appetizer, the Elk Chop with Spinach Salad & Maple Bacon dressing and Scallops with Lobster Bisque for entrees and Beignets for dessert. All of the food was great. The sides, however, were just ok.  The Elk Chop was served with Hominy and Slaw. The chop was amazing, the hominy and slaw were ok. The Scallops were served with a asparagus and a type of Hominy Succotash. Again, the Scallops were amazing, the sides, just ok. The beignets were good. Nothing extraordinary but good. They were kind enough to bring us some complimentary shortbread cookies in celebration of our anniversary and those were good too.  As for the service; this experience is going to widely vary depending on your server. Our server had the appearance of having partied a bit too late the night before and just barely getting it together for his evening shift. He was nice but he didn't give us the background on the restaurant that other patrons received. My hubby and I both ran out of our beverages twice and had to wait some time before getting refills. I had to actually ask for the refill both times. He was great at making suggestions from the menu and telling us about the dishes, though.  The ambience was nice but it was so quiet when we got there that we barely wanted to speak to each other for fear of disturbing those around us or having other patrons hear us. It was quiet enough that a whisper seemed loud. This got better the later it got as more and more people came in.  Overall, a nice experience but not a 5 star one. I expect impeccable service and knock out food that doesn't miss the mark. That being said, I would definitely return and try to have a different experience with another server and order other menu items."}
{"text":"The food here is exquisite! I came for my birthday and was very please indeed. The wine novel has over 100 selections and The Wonderland Project Pinot Noir was very favorable. The elk chop is truly a gem here! The staff and atmosphere is fits a very romantic vibe. Hope you enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Very pleased overall. Service was superb. Wine selection was absolutely wonderful, and the suggestion we got from the server was exactly what I described to love in a wine.   For an appetizer we had the seasonal cheese tray which was heavenly and included a local honey, multiple cheeses from around the states and house-made pita crackers.   I ordered trout, which was perfectly cooked with delectable sauce and spicing. My boyfriend ordered filet mignon, and he said it was wonderful. One tip: order it slightly more rare than you would typically; he said it wasn't quite as pink as he would have liked.   Unfortunately we were both too full for dessert.  I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've ever had! Our server Nicole made all the difference. Yes, the food and wine was amazing but Nicole's delivery and special touches (like suggesting an off menu dairy free dessert and pefectly timing the coffee and 'to go' boxes). Brava Nicole, you are a gem to a fine establishment!!!"}
{"text":"We went there for date night. Food/environment/service was very good. Nothing exceptional or very unique about the whole experience"}
{"text":"My fiance and I had dinner at The Fig Tree last night for our anniversary dinner and it was a phenomenal experience. The food was delicious and amazing, as you would expect it to be, but the service was what made the meal worth the money. As soon as we walked in, the hostess greeted us and wished us a happy anniversary; one of the servers (not ours) filled our water glasses after we sat down and was lovely and pleasant, but the real tour de force of the evening was our server, Rich. He was so nice and funny and knowledgeable, and especially patient. We were torn between 3 appetizers, and I personally was torn between all 3 salads, 4 different entrees, and 4 different desserts, and Rich talked me through every single item and not only offered his knowledge about each item and his own recommendation, but helped me pick each course based on which item would enhance the meal as a whole. When Rich brought the dessert plates out, they both had \"Happy Anniversary\" written on them in chocolate syrup, and then even after he brought the check, he brought one more plate (on the house) of blackberry macarons, that again had \"Happy Anniversary\" written on the plate beautifully. It really was a magical meal and experience, and we hope that the next time we go back there, we can have Rich as our server again."}
{"text":"Took the girlfriend here for Valentine's day, and was not disappointed. Service was great, drinks were strong, food was pricey (but I expected that) but definitely up to my expectations. The atmosphere is pretty quiet, but feels a bit cramped, since the place is a home turned into a restaurant. I had a southwest trout dish, and she had the special, which was a steak topped with king crab meat, in a horseradish sauce. We both enjoyed the food quite a bit. All in all, I believe we'll be coming back here, whenever a fancy night out is needed."}
{"text":"Went here for our 11th Wedding Anniversary, and found the house to be very cozy and elegant. I thought I was underdressed in slacks and a Polo shirt until some guys showed up with Jeans by the bar area.  Anyway, the food. Started off with a mixed cheese platter, which had a nice selection from Blue, aged sheep, Goat and cream with candied walnuts. Went very well with the nice rosemary bread they served.  For appetizers, I had the soup special which was a dark meat roasted chicken and bean soup. Very earthy and flavorful. My wife had the simple garden salad, with spinach and shaved parmesan reggiano.   My wife had the NY Strip special, with crab meat and a creamy horseradish. Cooked perfectly and tender. I had the Veal Chop, which was AWESOME! The quality of this meat was very top notch. I mean, when you can snarf down the FAT on a chop you KNOW IT'S GOOD! Melt in your mouth. I even exhibited heathen behavior by gnawing on the Veal Chop Bone....it was that good. Hey they didn't kick me out so there! :-)  For dessert we had their famous beignets. They served a generous portion of 4 of these succulent pillows of flavor, coated with Madagascar Cinnamon sugar and some creme anglaise, and some coffee gelato. Very heavenly!  Oh, and although I brought in a special bottle of wine from my personal cellar ($20 corkage fee), they do have an excellent wine list, and as others have noted, pretty reasonably priced for the most part. We started off with a Brut French Champagne which was only $7/glass. Not bad for a real FRENCH Champagne.  Service was excellent, food was served hot, they were attentive without being annoying. So all in all, this is a top notch place!"}
{"text":"The best food I have had in Charlotte, HANDS DOWN!  Interesting, exciting and delish food combinations. I would HIGHLY recommend the seabass and the dessert (omg) hazelnut chocolate torte....ugh, so good! The food was incredible and the service was second to none. I called ahead letting them know that a member of my party was celebrating a birthday and they went above and beyond to make it feel special (in a discrete way of course). The atmosphere is warm and inviting set in a renovated home it felt very cozy. And parking was very easy. I will definitely be heading back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"It's been several weeks since I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. And while the experience definitely merits a review, I've hesitated because I'm not sure how to approach it. She was blown away with the whole evening; I was less so. Although the blame for that is at least half my own. For starters, I was a little out of my element. Drop me in a back alley bar in a third world country where I don't speak the language and I'm fine. But pull out my chair for me, place a napkin on my lap and constantly sweep crumbs from the table with a little brush and I feel like I've crashed a dinner party at Downton Abbey. But that's my hangup, not their failing.  The restaurant's decor and ambiance was impeccable. Everything was as one would expect in a fine dining establishment. As soon as we arrived a hostess led us up the stairs, past old bedrooms converted into climate controlled wine cellars to a dining room with about 4 tables for two. Our waiter was attentive, patient, friendly and very knowledgeable. He did have a little difficulty at first recalling some of the specials. But this is completely understandable, given the amount of detail they have to memorize, just to have it all change the very next day. It's like every ingredient is given a minimum of 5 adjectives. I don't know how they do it.   We shared the appetizer of foie gras over blueberry bread pudding with blueberry-port gastrique and Sauternes macerated golden raisins. This was my first experience with foie gras, so I have no basis for comparison there. But the bread pudding, raisins and sauce was like magic. If only it had been bigger than a chicken nugget. If you're splashing out for foie gras, I'd recommend going all out and ordering champagne to go with it. To hell with thrift, right?  Given the bite-sized-ness of the foie gras, you'll probably want to order a salad. I can't remember what my girlfriend ordered but I can verify that my caesar salad was the best I've ever had anywhere. If you prefer a mild flavor, order it without the anchovies. I, for one like my food to bite me back. I was not disappointed.  The main course is where an adventurous appetite might lead you astray. HEED YOUR WAITER'S (and my) WARNING, THE NEW ZEALAND ELK CHOP IS INDEED TOUGH. I couldn't turn down the chance to try something new but soon wished I had. SPOILER ALERT: It tastes almost indistinguishable from beef and is nearly as tough as an overcooked pork chop. Of course, I can't hold this against them. I was warned, after all. But I would submit that such an inferior cut of meat doesn't deserve a place on their menu. At $42, some things simply aren't worth shipping from the far side of the world.  Fortunately, the meal ended on a high note with a dessert of beignets with cinnamon crême Anglaise and coffee gelato. Amazing!  Would I go again? Probably not. Not that the place isn't good; I'm just very rarely in the mood to drop $200 on a meal. And the next time I am, there are plenty of other places I need to try."}
{"text":"There was excellent service and food was very pleasing. Real romantic patio, but I recommend to go on a day that's not so hot...that can really make your date from flawless to failure. Their ac is not that great"}
{"text":"Man... I must be on a different level on this one because everyone seems to be bat-shit crazy about this place.  Don't get me wrong, I though it was okay.  I've heard about the Fig Tree over and over (and OVER) again since I moved here... so finally, for our Anniversary we decided to get all dolled up and experience it for ourselves.  The waitstaff was very kind and attentive, the food selection was okay - but there was nothing innovative, nothing that blew me away.  And I guess maybe my expectations were just too high...  but for me the best part of the meal was the salad.  My beau said the same thing.  He got the steak, I got the chicken special.  I wasn't crazy about the chicken so I asked for a box to take it home.  No joke we put the to-go box in the car and it smelled so horrendous we stopped the car the throw it out.  A $30 meal!  I'm going to give 3 stars because even though my experience wasn't great, obviously I missed something... so maybe it was me.  At the end of the day I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, but if someone's heart was set on it I would try it again.  I would rather spend my money somewhere incredible.  Rating: Meh  [mic drops]"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to Fig Tree for dinner the night we got engaged, it was our first time. We have heard so many great things about the restaurant, I, glad we could finally go!  We ordered the lobster hush puppies with a black bean purée for a starter, I had the filet and she had the lobster tail served over grouper and saffron risotto with a lobster blanc sauce - AHHHMAZING! We ordered a killer bottle of wine too.   Our server was absolutely amazing, very personable but also gave us our space as it was a special night. I wish I could remember his name! We finished off our meal with the beignets, which were to die for!!!!!   We can't wait to go back and indulge for our anniversary, this is the best restaurant in Charlotte in our books!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm . . . this place is so good.  I am just going to say right now,  it's expensive-  BUT if you are going for a date night or to celebrate- I think its worth it.  The ambience is great and the food is too.  I got the chicken and no lie, it was the best, juciest chicken I ever had.    Guys- treat your girl to this place and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"loved it.  was in from out of town and took my GF here for her birthday.  Place is about 2-3 miles outside of downtown in a cute little hood.  Restaurant is like walking into someone's house because it is....a house.  greeted right away and shown to our table without wait.  we were put upstairs in what could best be described as a small bedroom but the decor was very nice.  only issue I could come up with is being in that room with another couple you could hear their whole conversation as it was very quiet.  service was top notch.  menu/wine list was explained nicely and all questions answered.    had a nice bottle of wine, an app, salads and main courses.  she had the chicken and I had the trout.  both dinners were awesome.  very well seasoned, cooked and temperature.  one of the best meals we have had in awhile.  place is not cheap and is best used for a special occasion.  if I am every in Charlotte again I will come here!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Went hear to celebrate our met-iversary  (1st time we met). Service was the best I have had in a long time. The waiter, Rich, explained everything. I liked that he said the prices of the specials and additions without having to inquire. We ordered the lobster hush puppies. They were good and the jalopenos  were very spicy... Great flavor. I ordered the lobster and grouper. Lobster was delicious and buttery. The grouper was okay not heavily seasoned but the rice like( I think to risotto ) was yummy in the sauce. My fiancé got the filet done medium. It was cooked to order and he enjoyed it. The food came out nice and hot.  And everything timed perfectly. We also each got the Caesar salad ... Well worth the $3 each additional. He did order a martini ... He liked it but the name I can't remember but it was citrus and champagne like. For dessert we tried the beignets  ... Yummy and the accompanying coffee gelato was impressive!! Definitely recommend this place. It's nice, intimate and worthy of any special occasion (including just because)."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Atmosphere is quaint.  Waiter was attentive and very nice. Food was amazing.  Went outside the box and had the elk which was amazing!  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to trying out the Fig Tree for a while. The restaurant is in a beautiful old house with a nice atmosphere. We were warmly greeted by our server, who was excellent!! She knew the menu very well and was so friendly and helpful. She is the reason I am giving the fig tree three stars instead of two.  The appetizers were a bit heavy-handed. The chorizo stuffed squid is just too much. It was a lot of chorizo in a little squid. The escargot were very tender. They were served in a heavy Gorgonzola cream sauce, and not the usual garlic and butter. But that Gorgonzola sauce was heavenly with the focaccia.   My Caesar salad was pretty much how a Caesar salad should be. Nicely dressed with cool crisp romaine lettuce.  My husband got the soup of the day with his entrée. He had to send it back because it was sweet and a little offputting. It reminded me of a purée that I would make it my own blender. I expected more refinement from a restaurant like this. We also saw another gentleman at a different table sending his back as well.  My husband and I shared the lamb and the grouper.  The descriptions on the menu were so enticing, but unfortunately they did not taste as good as they looked. First I almost forgot that I had ordered the grouper since you couldn't even see it below the toppings. It was just overall bland. The lamb, although cooked perfectly, was also not well seasoned.   Not sure if it was an off night? But if the food was as good as the service I would have given it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, intimate setting... cocktails and food were excellent!  However, the service and attentiveness expected at the Fig Tree were lacking.  Our waiter began on a slow note and was downhill from there.  Our water glasses remained empty, the plates were removed by another waiter etc.... which left us not wanting to inquire about dessert and after dinner cocktails. We had all intentions of ordering dessert and coffee, but decided to go elsewhere to finish our evening. Too bad!! We were so looking forward to a lovely time at The Fig Tree."}
{"text":"Awesome, I stopped here for some dessert and they were totally accommodating. It's almost like stepping into a nice elegantly decorated living room. Service is pretty top notch and friendly even if all I wanted was dessert.  I got some pumpkin cheesecake and my date got the beignets. We stated to our server that we were probably going to share dessert with each other which usually means we should get some extra plates to divvy up the goods. Well was I super surprised when they brought out 2 desserts of each for us gratis! Was this be super nice to Jimmy day and I wasn't aware of it?! The beignets were light fluffy and fatty forming an excellent pairing with the creme and coffee. While the pumpkin cheesecake, oh god my pumpkin cheesecake. I am convinced it is the food of the gods, so creamy, so pumpkiny, with a buttery savory crust. Oh I was so tempted to lick the plate. We ate on a couch in front of the cozy fireplace, perfect.  I'm going to have to return here soon to sample more of their food and see how it fares."}
{"text":"Very quaint southern charm old house dining. Loved it. Wait staff extremely friendly and helpful. Food prepared very well with excellent presentation."}
{"text":"I went to the Fig Tree thinking it was going to be fantastic but it was not.  The food was VERY expensive, and not very satisfying.  My boyfriend had ostrich that was like rubber.  The pumpkin soup i had was great, but my steak was not.  I would not reccomend this place when there are so many other great options for the same or a cheaper price."}
{"text":"We went for dinner tonight as our \"nice meal\" while here in Charlotte. It was for sure a nice meal! My husband got the Grouper & Lobster Tail. I got the filet atop polenta cake & sautéed spinach. Both were delicious! They both came with a house salad that was good as well. The dressing was great. We both got dessert. I got the chocolate silk torte with pecan caramel ice cream. My husband got carrot cake with some kind of ice cream that had some spice to it. Both of our desserts were good. My husband's cake was a bit small though & he didn't finish his ice cream because of the spiciness. There was a rather large table of people there for a party & it got a little loud, but other than that, great experience."}
{"text":"So the ambiance is top notch and the service is great.  The wine list is very extensive.  I went for my birthday dinner. We had the Apple Beggars Purse and Stuffed Calimari as starters.  The Calimari was good and the Beggars Purse was excellent.  My bf got the Elk Chop and I had the Grouper with Lobster and Saffron Risotto.  The Elk Chop had great flavor amd tenderness. The lobster was some of the best I have had, the risotto was great, the grouper was a little dry.  For dessert we had the beignets, they alone are worth the trip.  Overall a great romantic night out."}
{"text":"I love the cozy decorum of The Fig Tree. White table linens and simple dinnerware do not equal stuffiness by any means. The service is top notch. Smooches to Chef Owner Zanitsch. For the high quality dish of well-seasoned, juicy veal, creamy risotto and asparagus.   The wine selection is tops. I attend dinner meetings here often and there is always a wait list due to the fan ship.  highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fine dining - you bet! This restaurant is in a restored historic house and beautifully done at that. Each room is small enough so that you feel like you are privately dining. The service is very well trained and professional. The servers know and understand the food, preparations and ingredients - that is so nice. Service is usually very prompt  and well paced, although we have waited a little longer than we would have liked between courses on a few occasions, but on balance we have not seen this to be an issue whatsoever. The wine list is extensive and well priced. I noticed that they have won the Wine Spectator award of excellence for many years in a row.  I would say you will find the seafood and chops are just superb. The chops range from Veal, Elk, Pork. and Lamb (on our visits). We have tried them all and for meat lovers they are not to be missed. Something I very much admire and respect is our meats always come out at the ordered temperatures. Thisis something less quality restaurants will bring an adventure of hit and miss. For appetizers we love the beggars purse, beef carpaccio and the foie gras. We don't usually eat dessert but have liked the Beignets.  I would be wiling to recommend this restaurant to anybody who loves fine dining."}
{"text":"For a place that costs $130 for two, I would have expected a lot more. I mean the food was good. Have I had better food for half or 1/4 of the price? Yes. Honestly, the food and ambiance were both a little boring. It had an 80s fine dining feel to it. Lackluster food, boring presentation, and no surprises. This is a great place to take your grandmother to for her 80th birthday. Not so much if you are trying to impress your hot date. Cheese plate and the filet mignon were good, simple, and the filet was cooked to an exact medium rare which requires precision but nothing surprising or innovative in either taste or style. I know the feel they are going for is classy and simple but if you are going to go that route, you need to elevate your food to an exceptional level and unfortunately, the Fig Tree was just ok. If I had to sum up this dinner in one word it would be \"unmemorable\"."}
{"text":"Got the Elk Chop!  Never had that or seem it on the menu!  The food was great, the wine list is massive!  If you don't go your are stupid!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and beautiful ambiance. Perfect for date night, enjoyed the steak and was happy about their wide variety of wine. Would highly recommend if your in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Cute place with good food. We had the foie gras & escargots to start, which were delicious. Then we had the lamb tenderloin, ny strip, grouper, & veal chop. Finished it up with red velvet cake. Everything was delicious & the service was awesome. Great place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Intimate setting, attentive wait staff, delicious dishes.  This is a great place for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"I finally made it to the Fig Tree after driving by for years! Food and wine were very good. I had meat, friend had veg. Both of us were happy."}
{"text":"Last year, I took my boyfriend to this restaurant for his birthday. We had such a wonderful experience, that I decided to take him back for his birthday this year. The reservation was made a month ago, and where they seated us, seemed like the last table in the house. We were sitting in the small room, with A table top  of eight people. They were loud, obnoxious, and vulgar. we realize they were having a good time, it was a shame that it was at the expense of our good time. As I'm writing this review, please keep in mind that this is a five-star restaurant. The waiter to spend very little time with us, unfortunately, most of his time was taken up with our obnoxious friends across from us. When we received our appetizer, it was ice cold. When brought to our waiters attention, he immediately, the appetizer was immediately taken off our bill. I will admit that the soup was exquisite. Unfortunately, once again, our main dishes went from luke warm to cold within a few minutes. Please keep in mind as you read this review, that their entrées, range anywhere from 30 to almost $50. By that time, I had heard enough of the word F..k. On my way to the bathroom, I met a woman, and I'm not quite sure if she was the owner or the manager. I expressed my concerns to her. She immediately apologized and offered to move us to a quiet spot to enjoy our dessert, which we gratefully accepted. By that time, or evening was completely ruined. On top of that, we made it very clear that both of us were gluten-free customers. After we received the bill, A special birthday treat was brought out to us. Thank God we didn't eat it! When our waiter came by to get the bill, he said oh that has a little bit of gluten in it. Are you kidding me, but little bit of gluten, can severely home a person who has a gluten intolerance. Now about  the bill, we were charged for the two entrées. You would think that a five-star restaurant, would have comped the entire bill, or at least given us a gift card inviting us back for a better experience. It appeared their biggest concern was for the table top of \"Elite\" and vulgar customers who obviously going to be spending a lot of money. This is going to be our final experience at the Fig Tree, we will never be going back."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!  My Fiancé and I just moved to Charlotte from DC and were a little worried about the restaurants in Charlotte compared to what we were used to in DC.  The Fig Tree was our first step into the Charlotte food scene and we were blown away!  First off, there were lots of things we wanted to try on the menu.  We settled on scallops and escargot for appetizers, house salads, grouper and filet for entrees and we split beignets for dessert.  I can honestly say I would order every single one again.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, the escargot were in a cream sauce (something I've never seen before but our waiter suggested it- he said it was so good we would be wiping the plate with our bread- and he was right!).  The side salads were even above par!  The grouper came on jasmine rice that was so flavorful.  My fiancé ate every bite of his steak.   On top of great food, our server was helpful in making choices, very friendly and on top of things. My only complaint was the guy sitting next to us in jeans- come on, if you're eating dinner at a restaurant with $40 entrees, jeans are not appropriate!! But obviously that's not the restaurant's fault.   All in all a great restaurant for a special occasion, we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Since I have not been in Charlotte long, it was difficult for me to decide on where to spend a really important anniversary. I researched restaurants and consistently saw great reviews about The Fig Tree. I decided to take my chances and let The Fig Tree serve us for this important event.  Curt was our waiter for the evening and he did not disappoint. His table-side manner was thoughtful, relaxed and attentive and he made great recommendations based on our culinary limitations. He even went out of his way to provide me with some suggestions for tours in Asheville, which he wrote down, when we got into a discussion about it. He's a total professional and the restaurant industry is lucky to have him.  The food was delicious. The presentation and combinations were creative and the thing that made it special was that it was not something I could just make at home or something I would have ordered at any other Charlotte restaurant. The menu had unique offerings and each was well thought out and delivered upon. The portions were satisfying which thrilled my husband.   The location is simple and elegant. It is not overstated but instead provides a cozy and semi-private and very personal dining experience. I look forward to making The Fig Tree a part of our Charlotte tradition for years to come."}
{"text":"Oh man. So good. Everyone talks about Fig Tree, so my wife and I had to check it out. We went there to celebrate her 31st trip around the sun and what a celebration it was!  She is not a huge fan of seafood, so any time we go somewhere that I can get fresh seafood I'm on it. I had the sautéed NC trout with crab meat, granny smith apples (also sautéed), and asparagus. DEE-LISH-US. The sautéed apples gave it a great flavor and the fish was melt-in-your-mouth. I'm not a huge fan of asparagus, but it was better than expected as well. To drink, I had the \"Thirst And How\", a spin on the Old Fashioned. Very good, but a little strong for my taste.  Overall a great dining experience and great for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary. Definitely lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Ambiance was intimate and dressy. The escargot appetizer was amazing. We literally cleared the plate, enjoying the sauce with the home-made bread. The entrees (elk chop and veal chop) were delicious and were hearty portion sized, which we appreciated given that it was expensive. The dessert (chocolate silk tart?) was amazing, again we finished the entire thing. Great place for a bday or anniversary. We will be back for our next special occasion!"}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I went with another couple to The Fig Tree for the first time. Our friends had been before and highly recommended the trip.  I was excited to try Elk. We had reservation and were sited promptly at our reservation time.  We were slightly skeptical as we walked in a certain dish that passed by had a strong fish smell.  We sat upstairs in a small room with four other todays.  I prefer having a slightly more open dining experience, but it was quaint.  This is a renovated old bungalow, so it was exactly what should be expected.   To the food and drinks.....we both started with cocktails, my wife had a pear martini and I had a bourbon maple cocktail.  The bourbon cocktail was sweeter than most bourbon drinks with hints of orange and the bourbon was not over powering. As apps we had the octopus and beggars purse.  This was the first time I have had octopus, but a mild favor, and cooked perfectly, not chewy at all.  The beggars purse was wonderful and could have eaten a whole one myself.  After apps had a spinach salad with maple vinaigrette and bacon.  Add the goat cheese it is some of the creamiest around. Our entrees were out right after we finished our salads.  I had the Elk.  This is what I had came for.  I was a little disappointed in the fact that it was cooked a little more than the medium I had requested.  It was a little tough.  I should have ordered it medium rare, however I was worried it would be a notch to rare for me.  I should have realized that with a leaner meat to cook less, but oh well.  Honestly I probably would not pay the premium on Elk again, and just get a steak.  The favor difference was almost unnoticably.  The sides were wonderful, cooked purple cabbage and BACON, and a type of dumpling (can't remember the name.) Excellent desserts followed beignets and butterscotch creme brûlée.  The beignets were different than what I expected (Cafe du Monde) more like a Greek Loukoumades.  The creme brûlée was some of the best I have ever had. Service was good, but the food is the main attraction here."}
{"text":"Excellent food, perfect service.  We had a party of 6 and ordered the foie gras, escargots and cheese plate as our appetizers.  All were really great, but the foie gras stole the show.   For our entrees we had the lamb, filet, trout and veal.  Everyone really enjoyed their meals.  I personally had the filet (which is prime beef by the way... only a few restaurants in Charlotte even offer prime!) and it was like velvet.   For desert we had the crème brulee and it was about the best I've ever had.  The table also ordered the chocolate mousse and the cheesecake and both went over very well.  This restaurant, for me, is among the top 3 in Charlotte.  I can't wait to go back.  The prices are reasonable, the mood is unpretentious, the service is top notch and the food is just excellent."}
{"text":"The best fine dining in Charlotte. Service is wonderful and food is delicious !  Intimate and beautiful!"}
{"text":"Our experience at the Fig Tree was truly enjoyable. Visiting from out of town, we were happily surprised to stumble upon it. The atmosphere was homey, welcoming with a touch of Southern hospitality. We started out with a great bottle of Meritage and fresh bread with rosemary infused olive oil. We had a great pasta and an awesome filet mignon with yummy fingerling potatoes. We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This seems to be the special occasion destination in Charlotte. So, for my wife's birthday, I made reservations several weeks out. This is recommended, and I don't know that we'd have gotten a table without them, even on a week night.  The building is an old house, but retains much of its charm. Parking is tight, but there seem to be enough spaces for the guests it can hold. We were seated upstairs in a smallish room with only four tables. The atmosphere is classic with plaster walls and hardwood floors. It's easy to carry on a conversation.  Service was prompt and knowledgeable, and we started with a cheese plate and she had a glass of the Malbec. The cheeses were quite tasty, and she enjoyed the wine a lot.  For our entrees, we ordered the scallops (her) and the veal chop (me). Both dishes were perfectly prepared. We know from experience that scallops, while simple, are wrong most of the time, and the veal was succulent and very tasty. I especially liked the potatoes, and my wife commented on the chorizo couscous was divine,  For dessert, I have the spiced fig cheesecake and she had the coconut pannacotta. Frankly, the cheesecake was just okay but the pannacotta was very very good.   Be prepared for the price of fine dining. The value is mostly in the food, which is excellent, but the atmosphere and service are also worth the cost. When we were there celebrating her birthday, the three other couples eating in the same room were celebrating: birthday, anniversary, anniversary. See what I mean? I don't know of an analogous experience in Charlotte, but I would always welcome finding one."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, the vibe, the excellent wine list; the martini, the hostess, the server, the chef, the entire experience!!!  We had a fantastic dining experience here on a recent business trip.  The service was wonderful; the presentation of the food spectacular, the taste DEVINE!  The pace between each course could not have been better.  I truly never understood the need to rush patrons out the door for a quick turnover of a table. I want to dine and I certainly don't feel I need to inform my server how to pace the meal.  Our server was spot on without being told!!!! Perfection on all counts.   I would fly back to Charlotte NC just to visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally, we're finding places in Charlotte we love. It's official- I love Fig Tree. It's very quaint (a cute house) and the service is top-notch. While they were very busy, it's organized as such where you don't feel you're in a crowded restaurant or too close to the other tables. Very intimate setting, little fireplace, lovely bar, beautiful stairway leading to the restrooms upstairs.  Make a reservation- we did. We arrived early and were seated at promptly 8:45, our reservation time. Our server was very sweet and knowledgeable, explaining the menu and some of the signature dishes. The bread was divine and went perfectly with the escargot appetizer we ordered, accompanied with mushrooms and a gorgonzola/ garlic sauce. He encouraged us to dip our bread in the sauce, which we did- and oh boy. Heaven in your mouth.  I ordered the ahi special (he said it was one of the finest cuts he had seen in a very, very long time) and it was also delicious. It came with a risotto and everything was cooked to perfection.  I really love The Fig Tree and am excited to find such a charming spot in Charlotte."}
{"text":"One of the cutest restaurants I have ever dined at. A beautiful house with bedrooms as private rooms.  We were catching a flight right after dinner so we couldn't binge. We started we the escargot and fois gras and had the Elk Chop for dinner. All dishes were exquisitely prepared. The wine list at the fig tree is impressive, a little disappointing they were out of the first two wines we ordered."}
{"text":"My husband I waited for a special occasion to dine at the Fig Tree and it was wonderful! The hostesses were warm and wished my husband a happy birthday. The atmosphere is sophisticated but cozy. Our waiter (Ty) was attentive, friendly and  made excellent recommendations. Most importantly, the food was amazing and the bananas foster cheesecake was exceptional. The entire experience left me with a scrumptious memory. The Fig Tree is a Charlotte must for a special night. Yum."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorites in all of Charlotte. Wine selection doesn't disappoint. Chef's dishes are well prepared and presented. Service is exacting. Quaint location with great ambiance. Seeing sunset over the city in the Warmer months or enjoying the fireplace in winter add to the truly special feel.  On this particular occasion, in addition to apparent teamwork all around, my server Michael and the host Alex helped execute a great birthday experience.   As always, looking forward to my next experience."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my husbands birthday. Great cozy atmosphere and great service! I got the veal chop and my other half got the elk. Elk was our favorite,we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a terrific dinner with family. This is a place to go for a special evening. The servers are professional and friendly and enhance the dining experience. This is much appreciated today as so many upscale restaurants use kids as servers and they simply do not have the experience with food and wine to make proper recommendations.   Everything we ate was delicious, but the standouts were the foie gras, grouper with lobster, veal chop, filet and carrot cake.   My only complaint was that dessert should not cost $11 for an amount that was about 4 bites. Absolutely the smallest dessert I have ever seen and also the most expensive. Also, it would be nice to have a complimentary dessert for someone celebrating a special event especially when the party has spent over $400.   Be prepared for two things when visiting. Your meal will be very expensive and it will be one of the best meals you have this year."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Highly recommend! We went for my husbands birthday dinner on a Sunday! We are from Louisiana/Texas and enjoy going to nice meals when we travel. This would be the perfect place for someone local or visiting! We would definitely come back on a future visit. There were 4 of us and we all ordered something different. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my very favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  I have never been disappointed!  The staff is wonderful and the chef is a culinary master."}
{"text":"A truly classy and elegant restaurant. As you walk in, it feels like if you are in someone's house very cozy. Then the service is impeccable. The food was amazing from beginning to end. The grouper and lobster tail over risotto was just delicious. A must try place. We will definitely return when we are back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Really what sets this place apart is the atmosphere in the place and the service, the quality food and incredible wine list don't hurt either.  We've been in Charlotte a couple of years now, but have never really made it up to the 'Elizabeth' neighborhood, but it's a really nice especially in spring, flowers in bloom, and not an empty seat on the patio because of great weather.  The Fig Tree is tucked into what looks like just a neighborhood home, and that's how you feel when you come in - Like a friend visiting a neighbor.  When we arrived for a later dinner (8:30 reservation) the patio was entirely full, and a few large tables were set up indoors.  The extensive wine list was nice to see and gave a million options.  Dinner was equally delicious, they were still in their 'winter' menu consisting of lots of creamy dishes as our waiter Jay informed us - And that the menu changes upon the season and what they can get locally sourced.  We had Carpaccio as an App, the Mrs. went with Pappardelle and I had the Halibut and Maine Lobster.  All were awesome.  Great experience and we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the area, and decided this looked like a great place to celebrate my birthday. It was an excellent decision. As other people have mentioned, being located in a historic Charlotte home really sets it apart. It's beautiful, but not snobby. The wine list is incredible, the service was wonderful and the food... butterscotch creme brûlée. That's all I need to say. Holy moly. Amazing. If you can afford to eat at a place like that several times a year, go for it. But for the rest of us, it's the kind of place that you'll want to save for a special occasion. Be ready to sit and enjoy your food and wine. We spent a couple of hours there and I'd love to go back again sometime!"}
{"text":"My husband & I went to the Fig Tree for our anniversary and the food was delicious and the service was wonderful! Some of the food was very salty, but still very good!"}
{"text":"A cheese plate featuring 100% water buffalo cheese, elk chops, and the cayenne pepper triple chocolate cheese made for one of the best and most unique Charlotte meals I have ever had. My only criticism, however minor, is the music: \"It's Beginning to Look a lot like Christmas\" and \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\" played on a loop can get absolutely maddening through the course of a one hour dinner service. That should not deter you though as The Fig Tree is now in my Charlotte Top 3."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable experience. The bread, and cheeses are fantastic. I can't lie; the entrees were a little underwhelming for the price. Do:   - Take advantage of the lengthy wine list - Order the flight of ice wine"}
{"text":"I went to a wine tasting here, and it was amazing. The food was great, and the chef was very kind about accommodating my picky vegetarianism. From the appetizer to the dessert, it was a great fine-dining experience.   I haven't been to a regular dinner here, but I highly recommend their wine tastings. This one was $75 per person, and it was worth every penny. I left feeling slightly tipsy and with a bellyfull of fine dining finest.   It's a beautiful place for a romantic dinner. The one problem with the wine tasting was that we were seated with several other people, which kind of cut down on the romance...however, it was worth it for the great food and the little education in wine."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the the quality and quantity. Went there for my first wedding anniversary. Didn't even get a complimentary dessert. The server was very attentive but that is pretty much all I can say about the place. Food was average for a \"high price\" restaurant, and the drinks were mediocre--nothing to go back twice for. Overall, disappointed that we didn't have a \"wow\" experience for our first wedding anniversary---after the much anticipated hype"}
{"text":"Tonight is our 3rd year anniversary and the atmosphere was prefect for our occasion.  The food and service was awesome!  We ordered escargot and fois gras for appetizer, the fois gras was fantastic!  We ordered the elk chop and veal chop!  The veal chop was tender and the elk chop presentation could have been better!  This place is definitely a romantic place and very pricey!"}
{"text":"It was my first time dining there I went with my husband for our anniversary and we had an amazing experience everything was fabulous the food, the atmosphere, and the staff I highly recommend this place.. u will enjoyed"}
{"text":"I really like The Fig Tree, I just don't loooove it.   Food - My husband and I ordered an apple dish for an appetizer. He was reluctant but I figured it cannot be bad! It was actually good and refreshing to eat. Definitely a great starter before the main show.  I ordered the scallop dish in a bed of beluga lentils. They did a great job with the temp of the seafood. It was perfect for me (I do not like them undercooked). I find the lentils very interesting and it complemented the dish. My husband had the lamb and he really loved it.  Price - Definitely a pricey place, but you get your money's worth for a $$$ restaurant.   Place - Very cozy decor, home feel, but nice restaurant setting. In some areas, I feel it is a little too small or cramped (especially upstairs).  I saw people parked next door where it said do not park..  Special - The waiter and staff was kind to personalize your birthday or anniversary on the dessert plate. It makes the occasion/dinner special!   Service - Our waiter was nice and attentive. It did take awhile to get our check though.. But ah well.   Although our experience at The Fig Tree was good. That's one checked off on places to go have dinner dates in Charlotte. I was just not blown away with the place and venue. I tend to prefer the more modern, upscale restaurant for that price. If you are more of a comfy and homey feel, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Went and ate here last night and was not too happy overall. I ordered the antelope chip which i ordered medium, it came out medium well and was dry, I ended up feeding half of it to my dog. I had some sort of apple bread pudding that came with the chop, which was kind've bland and didn't compliment the food at all like a nice potato dish would have. The bread they bring out for you is also not the best it's very dense and almost pound cake like, they serve it with what seems to be simply garlic put in a blender ...was not a big fan overall. My friend ordered the filet and said he woke up this morning because of a stomach ache. The place is very nice though and is a great spot for a romantic type date, not a casual friendly dinner place, next time ill go to la Bon or del friscos when I want a 5 star meal. I was quite disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"I went to The Fig Tree for a nice birthday dinner and was super impressed. First of all, the service was fantastic. My brother is allergic to dairy and eggs, which makes eating in restaurants extremely hard for him. In fact, he hates eating out. Servers usually either tell him what he can order on the menu (which is often not much) or they actually refuse to serve him certain dishes because of trace amounts (this annoys him). The Fig Tree was extremely accommodating, though, and made adjustments to the dishes we ordered so he wouldn't get sick.   Secondly, and perhaps more importantly from my perspective, this food was incredible. I have lived in France before and enjoyed the creative twist The Fig Tree put on traditional French dishes. The seared foie gras with bacon praline and blueberry caramel sauce drizzled on top was unbelievable. My entree, the maple duck with raisin and sunflower seed risotto was equally incredible. Last but not least, the beignets were SO good. Warm, soft, and coated with a thick layer of cinnamon sugar. Will definitely be heading back here in the next month or two."}
{"text":"I've been living just around the corner from here for almost a year now... no more than a 5 minute walk. Several people said this place was good, but me and my girlfriend hadn't made it by to try out. So when I made reservations for dinner on New Years Eve, you can imagine how excited we were. When we arrived I thought the design and ambiance was charming inside. After settling on drinks, we put in an order of lobster hushpuppies to start. They were pretty good.. I'd give them a solid B. The bread arrived around the same time, to dip in a garlic puree. It was amazing. For entrées, I couldn't decide between the ostrich or the lobster and flounder combo, but finally chose the latter. She went with the filet, butterflied and cooked well done (I know it should be illegal to order steak THAT cooked, but it's the only way she'll eat it). Things were going great, then both main courses came out. Shockingly we were both extremely disappointed with the flavor.. or lack of it. Her steak was dried out and chewy. She's ordered filets the same way at other places and they still tasted tender. But not here. My lobster tail was small... no more than 3 or 4 bites. And the flounder tasted very plain. When the bill came and it was time to go, we both left very disappointed in the overall experience. I mean what good is a nice atmosphere and phenomonal bread if the main course doesn't deliver? For the steep price, I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to Fig Tree for his birthday. Stellar service, unique menu and everything was amazing. Flavors, temperatures, presentation were all fabulous! The dessert called Napoleon is red velvet cake, brownie and cheesecake all layered into an amazing creation. Must try."}
{"text":"There is no doubt that this is the BEST restaurant in Charlotte! The food were so delicious and they paid attention to all the details. Every staff there was very polite and their service would never make you feel uncomfortable. We had a perfect new year eve there. This restaurant will be our go to place for all the important events."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, and attention to detail.  If you enjoy fine dining, this is considered one.  Impressive everything and the wine is is top notch."}
{"text":"Went here with a potential vendor during a business trip to Charlotte recently.  I had heard about the Fig Tree prior but hadn't been.  It is located in an old house so it is very small but well appointed.  We had a party of about 12 - 15 and the waitstaff did a great job.  The service was impeccable.  The food was excellent - i am not sure about some of the other reviews that said the food was just ok.  Everyone in our party was delighted with their dishes.  We had several (read about 6) bottles of wine and drinks.  The wine list is excellent.  I did not pay so i cannot really give a good handle on price but I am pretty sure it was expensive per person.  This is a nice romantic restaurant that would be prefect for special occassion.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My sons 10th birthday wish, since he wants to be a chef, was to go to some fancy restaurant that has an involved menu. SO we went to the Fig Tree. Although pricey it met all our expectations. The staff was SUPER. They were very attentive and helpful and answered all my sons numerous inquiries. The food was absolutely great. We had all the odd dishes too: Octopus, Fois Gras, Elk, and Ostrich. The ambience of the old house is also very nice and we find it especially neat that it is named teh Lucas house because that is our last name."}
{"text":"Easily the best restaurant for fine dining in Charlotte. I took my family here the day after Christmas. It was decorated and welcoming, and exactly what we were looking for. The escargot and oyster appetizers were so rich. Our table ordered almost every main course (with our party of 5) and they were all incredible for lunch. This is the perfect restaurant to impress the out of town family :) Our compliments to the chef and staff!"}
{"text":"Excellent special occasion restaurant. Everything we had was tasty and the service was excellent.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is clearly a quality place with an excellent atmosphere, menu and wine list.  Love the cozy feeling of the historic house-turned restaurant.  The owners and staff are super friendly and I would definitely go back.  So why not 5 stars?  I really wanted to, and I may re-rate after another experience if I'm really impressed, but my only hangup was that the menu didn't quite seem to fit the season (heavy risotto in the hot summer) and the food, while exceptional, didn't \"wow\" me.  To put that in context, I've been to most of the CLT restaurants and just starting to get my reviews posted, and I'll probably end up with maybe 5 places tops with 5 stars.  Same goes for the 1 stars.  I have a baseline and put them on a curve, and Fig Tree is probably the highest among the 4s.    Seem pretentious with my reviews and system?  Maybe, but with the high cost of these restaurants, I hold fine dining establishments at high standards.  If we go out and spend $150+ on a dinner for two, we should be impressed and expect a lot.  If we give places a free pass with inflated reviews and nothing but praise, only the customers suffer.  Help make CLT restaurants better by giving honest feedback and holding them accountable!"}
{"text":"Bread + Garlic spread + olive oil is great. Could not stop eating that and they're good about refilling the bread.   Veal carpaccio is decent. Def get the fresh ground pepper with it. Escargot is RICH with a decadent cream and cheese. Highly recommend that. Also the scallops were great. They only come as 2 smaller scallops so not a great dish to share.   Grover and lobster - Grover was slightly too salty for me but it's a great decent portion. The lobster tail was phenomenal!   Beignets are freshly made in house. They added in another one as we had 5 ppl and it usually comes in 4. Really nice and fresh and comes with a coffee ice cream.   The service was great! And cute ambience as the restaurant is set in a home. Def recommend making a reservation!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved it!! Clean, fresh, flavorful food and great wine selection! Service was excellent also. Worth the price if used to quality not quantity!"}
{"text":"This is the best dinner experience I've had in Charlotte and really it is not even close.  It is definitely a special occasion type of place unless you're rolling in dough.  You are definitely going to spend a chunk of change but trust me, you will not regret it.  Everything was absolutely spectacular.  Some of the best food that I have ever tasted.  I cannot wait to go back and also introduce my friends to this fantastic establishment.  The most confident 5/5 I've ever given on Yelp."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, top notch service. Pricey but everything we had was excellent (chicken entree, lamb entree, excellent house salads, and beignets for dessert). Such a classy atmosphere too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stop reading this review and head out to this restaurant ASAP! Absolutely fantastic. Best service and food in Charlotte without a question. It is even better than the McNich House Restaurant which is rated 5 stars.  This could easily be a Michelin starred restaurant, food is cooked perfectly and everything pairs well. The veal demi glace and polenta are HEAVEN!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed this restaurant on my birthday - the old house it's in is beautiful and you'll sit in one of several private rooms (about four tables in each room).  The menu has some unique items and we tried the Elk Chop and Veal Chop.  It was my first Elk Chop and, as far as Elk goes, this is about as good as you're going to get.  It was perfectly charred and tender at medium rare.  I really enjoyed it, but after trying the Veal Chop, probably wouldn't order it the next time.  The bone-in Veal Chop was the best we've had!  Super tender and flavorful.  All sides were a perfect compliment to the meat.  The \"butter\" they serve with their bread isn't butter...it's actually roasted and pressed garlic.  Incredible!!  Try a great bottle of wine and save room for one of their delicate desserts.  The Fig Tree offers an elegant atmosphere, a friendly environment, and a delicious dining experience!"}
{"text":"Ah...another Charlotte staple when choosing a ultra gourmet and romantic evening.  This was my first visit to the Fig Tree and I was very excited to see what it was all about to say the least.  I had already decided on my entree before even walking in the door so I was all set.  Thankfully, my girlfriend with her grand ways made reservations during the same time they were decorated for Christmas so the atmosphere was just perfect for us.  I ended up getting the grouper that came laden in a butter sauce with lobster meat that adorned the top.  It was great!  The cheese plate we had prior was good as well but may be a bit overpriced at $17.  My girlfriend ended up getting the pork chop entrée and wasn't pleased at all with the preparation of the chops as they were a bit too fatty....shame.  I later tried the chops and I would have to agree they weren't exactly fat free but I soldiered through it anyway...ha!  The service was impeccable and delightful and the whole experience (all be it a little downtrodden due to the chops) was good enough to have me back again"}
{"text":"Very intimate place. Took my GF for her birthday. Good food, in a romantic setting. A must try"}
{"text":"Excellent!  I found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out. Walked in at 5 pm and was luckily seated. The place was packed that night.   I ordered a house salad that was good. More fresh than flavorful. I then had my appetizer that was the \"apple pouch\" and that was amazing. Excellent flavor. My main course was the lamb that was served rare, and that was the best way to have it. The flavor was awesome in this meat. I felt the risotto could have used some more flavor but the dish was very good.   Finishing with desert I had the chocolate hazelnut desert. It was ok but the doughnuts was the thing to get! Great sauce and ice cream to go with them. They were also fried perfectly.   This place was so good I tried to get reservations for the next night and I wasn't able to.   I would highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner! From the moment we stepped in the door we had a great experience. The service was impeccable, perfectly timed and our server was extremely knowledgeable about the food and wine! I went out in a limb and ordered the elk....wow!! Everything we tasted was amazing! Would recommend for a special occasion or celebration. Best meal I have had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The immediate word that pops into my head is \"perfection\"! Their wine selection is awesome AND the gal that approached us immediately after being seated actually new what she was talking about. Eddie took over after that and served us flawlessly throughout our Anniversary dinner. We found ourselves planning our next dinner because the menu is so appealing.The Fig Tree exceeded our expectations and then some. Great bar area if you arrive early."}
{"text":"As a native Charlottean, I have no idea how I've never been to The Fig Tree. Now that I'm an \"Elizabethan\" I made it a priority to visit. I am impressed.  The house is so interesting. I love the bar. The service was first class. The environment is intimate if you want it to be.  All the food was as described on the menu, good quality-lots of flavor.  I will absolutely return to The Fig Tree."}
{"text":"First time diners at Fig Tree. We arrived early for our reservation on a Saturday evening and they had our table ready in a dining room off the front main room. Low light, quiet atmosphere - perfect for a date night.  I had the veal chop with the smashed fingerling potatoes, cremini mushrooms and sherry garlic butter sauce. Delicious! My dining companion had the filet with polenta cake and spinach. They cooked it perfectly (medium well) on first try! We weren't used to that - even at some steakhouses they undercook the request and it must be sent back, but not here.   The dinner lived up to the reputation, and we will definitely return. Our waiter and the staff were all professional and attentive. A wonderful dining experience.   The only disappointing aspect had nothing to do with the restaurant but with the dress of some of the other diners - I do not think cargo shorts and flipflops are appropriate attire for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Not sure where to begin with this restaurant because everything about it was exceptional. The service, the ambiance and especially the food was five star quality. This is a special occasion restaurant for sure and you will not be disappointed when you dine here. My wife and I came here for our anniversary. We had the scallops to start and they were delicious. Even the garden salad was top notch. I highly recommend the veal chops, with shrimp and potatoes. The set up for this meal was perfect. My wife had the swordfish which was the special for the night and she thought it was divine. This is a beautiful restaurant in Charlotte and a must dine for anyone looking for a wonderful night out"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant in a home, each room seems to have a different feel to it. The dress code seems to be a little confusing. Charlotte is very casual and there are families in shorts and short sleeves and then couples all dressed up. Now the important stuff, the food. Very very good. Every entree came with a salad, I up charged mine to a Cesar with calamari per the recommendation of the waiter. Worth it. The main course was a lamb on risotto. Ton of flavor, ton of texture contrast. Loved it. The only miss was the dessert. I ordered the mille feuille which I need to send them one from NY and show them how its done. Didn't ruin the meal or the experience at all. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has not been."}
{"text":"Very good and upscale restaurant in an old house. Food was good, Service was also very reliable. This is not a five-star meal though as others have suggested. We eat out a great deal and there were many aspects of the meal that were good or slightly above average."}
{"text":"Quality,presentation,choices and 5 star service. Chef Greg did an outstanding job creating  the best food I have ever had. Being a native New Yorker and now Floridian I've been to the best restaurants and this restaurant is in my top ten. I will come back every time I visit Charlotte. The lobster tails were sweet and tender. Shrimp appetizer and cheese board with great assortment of cheeses. Everyone raved about the filet Minon. How lucky you are to have a first class restaurant like THE FIG TREE. Great ambience too!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, as a well versed food snob who is throughly versed in the Charlotte dining scene, this is the BEST restaurant in its class in the area.  It has everything I want, and more in a fine dining establishment.  Great Service, atmosphere, and most of all AWESOME FOOD.  We went this past Friday for my wife's birthday dinner.  They took the first part of the week off (New Years Week off), but opened back on Thursday.  I left a message on their machine on Monday to call me for a reservation and I had certain questions for the chef.  I received a call on Wednesday confirming that they had availability and we discussed the menu where I made certain requests that would put the finishing touches on making my wifes birthday memorable.  I requested Chantrelle Mushrooms as a side and they were able to accomodate me (SCORE POINTS FOR ME WITH THE WIFE!)  We ate the Brie Stuffed Tart as an appetizer, which was delicately made and had a wonderful flavor.  I also topped my house salad with warm fried calamari which was a decadent add on that can't be beat!  I ate the Osso Bucco which was accompanied by a nice spatzle (sp?) that was perfectly cooked and much better than other Osso Bucco's served in the area.  We finished it off with a Godiva Chocolate cheesecake which was decorated with \"Happy Birthday\" for my wife.  What I like about the Fig Tree is that it's a locally owned, Ched run establishment that has stood the test of time.  It hasn't compromised quality in a tough economy like most other non chains and seems to have it's act together.  They use local farms / produce when they can and jusdging by the crowd on Friday night other people have taken notice and appreciate it also.  Well done Fig Tree!  We are lifelong fans!!"}
{"text":"Loved it.  Sat outside on the porch.  Cheese tray had great variety, Caesar with calamari was wonderful (but hold the croutons), veal very flavorful and the accompanying potatoes had great flavor and texture.  We asked out waitress to pair our wine, and she did a super job.  Topped it off with strawberry tart....the basil cream was perfect.  Of course, my husband said he would only have one bite...yeah, right, more like he ate half!  Oh, and the French press decaf....the perfect ending.  Ok, it is our fav Charlotte restaurant for many reasons...flavors, service atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  The food is wonderful and the service impeccable.  We mentioned it was our anniversary and everyone from the hostess to the busboy wished us a happy anniversary.  They even wrote it in chocolate on our dessert!"}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here, and were very impressed with the romantic ambiance, the food and the wine selection. The salmon was out of this world, and my wife really enjoyed her fillet. My only complaint was how close the tables were to one another -- we were a little too cozy with the couple next to us, and it dampened the intimacy a bit. Otherwise, one of the best places in Charlotte for a special night out!"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant. All of the items we ate were unique and tasty. Our server was very attentive without being overbearing at all. The Beggar's Purse appetizer is a must!!!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly not sure how Fig Tree is on the top ten list for Charlotte. I'm genuinely not trying to be critical, but I've eaten here several times now, and I've yet to be blown away. I'd settle for being even moderately happy with our appetizers and meals, but I can't even say that sadly.  I just genuinely feel like there's a lot of better options within a mile, and I doubt we will continue to go back. To be totally fair, every time we have visited the staff is exceptional and very kind. Plus, the atmosphere is lovely. Sorry, but I just can't give them more than 3 stars in good conscience."}
{"text":"The ingredients are quality and everything was cooked really well but the dishes are all covered in really rich over powering sauce.  The lobster starter you couldn't taste the lobster.  I think the place needs to recognize the star of the plate and play to that rather than another it.  I'm glad I came but won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very nice place,  awesome service and food,  there is a great selection of wines. The foie gras and napoleon cake was perfection!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love The Fig Tree.  First of all, the restaurant is in the beautifully restored Lucas house on the corner of 7th and Hawthorne.  As soon as you walk in you are met with an atmosphere of balanced elegance and comfort.  The service is spot on-friendly staff who are timely with the plating and water, but give you enough space for intimate conversation.  The food is absolutely divine.  The menu changes with the seasons but some of my favorites have been the seared pumpkin sead encrusted scallop over a pumpkin and potato hash with a cider butter sauce, beet carpaccio, apple beggar's purse with carmalized pears, and some incredible deserts.  They will also accomodate any dietary issues you may have...an ex and I did a 5 course vegetarian wine paired dinner no problem.  The chef/owner, Greg, came out and personally said hi.  I have always had a beautiful time here.  A great place to impress, but also appropriate for a lovely night out with friends.  PS...they have wine dinners every month or so where you can meet the wine maker!"}
{"text":"Want to love this restaurant but can't. Have dined here several times and the last time was not memorable. The oysters were good but the elk was over cooked and tough. The service was perfect just not the food.  Even the side dishes with the meal was plain. They do make a great cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Fine dining restaurant feel. My husband and I both ordered the veal. It was...pretty good. Out waiter was awful though. Took forever!!! Thought from the reviews that this place would be great but frankly, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Experienced diner for the first time at the Fig Tree last night while attending a birthday dinner. The atmosphere is perfect for a date or just a quiet time to yourself. The food was not great at all, I ordered the Filet mignon and it came with spinach, polenta and what I think was cheese on top surrounded by a broth. There was nothing great about this meal, my filet was tough and I mean hard on the outside. The polenta was very very mushy as if it was over cooked. The spinach was delicious, as for the lump of cheese they could have left off the plate.  The Fig Tree was not for me but the service was excellent and my waiters were awesome."}
{"text":"Wow. I don't normally leave reviews for places, but this was the most delicious meal I've had in recent memory. My husband and I came here to celebrate my birthday and it was perfect! Everything from the House salad, homemade focaccia bread to the main dish and dessert. I told our waiter, Gary (who was amazing) that I couldn't remember the last time I said \"Mmm delicious!\" After everything I ate  we will definitely be dining here again in the future!"}
{"text":"Fig Tree is one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. The restaurant is in an older home and has a wonderful, inviting ambiance. The service is always attentive and friendly.   Everything that I have ever ordered from seafood to desserts has been excellent. They have an expansive selection of wine. You will not be disappointed with the Fig Tree."}
{"text":"Though certainly not bad this place seems highly over rated. Scallops were mediocre at best, & the formal atmosphere in small cramped quarters doesn't appeal to my relaxation mode. Service was good.  Not on my \"must return\" list."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. I was brought here on my birthday and I couldn't be happier. Our server was phenomenal and because I have such a terrible memory, I believe it was Jay or Jason? He took us on the tour through the menu and truly made us feel welcomed and appreciated. The food was also excellent! We had duck and red snapper. Excellent excellent excellent! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Even though it was Valentine's Day and they were completely booked, you wouldn't be able to tell because all of the servers were calm, cool, and collected. We got our food pretty quick for it being at capacity. They stagger reservations so that it doesn't negatively affect your experience. Parking is a little hard as there's not much and finding the right entrance in heels on the gravel is not fun. The bathrooms are very clean and is decorated nicely. We ate upstairs in a small room with 4 other tables which was slightly awkward as we could hear all the conversations. We ordered the veal carpaccio which was pretty good. I would get it again. For the entrees we got the lobster and sea bass over forbidden rice with a tiny piece of bok choy. It was okay but was hoping for more flavor. We also got the scallops with Israeli couscous, corn, and shishito peppers. Scallops were perfect, but the peppers didn't provide enough to the whole dish. For dessert we got the beignets and absolutely devoured it. Would definitely recommend getting the beignets."}
{"text":"What a perfect meal! My husband and I dined here based a recommendation from my Dad while we were in town.  They have an impressive wine list. Some 1000 different bottles or so. We even found a couple gems in there at great prices. Very happy with our selection of a St. Emilon Grand Cru at just $68.  We had the spicy lobster chorizo appetizer and a cheese plate to start. The lobster was excellent and a very unique preparation. The cheese plate had a great selection.  We had the elk chop and lamb tenderloin as entrees. We LOVED both of these. Meat was cooked perfectly. Such unique flavors and preparations.  The service is impeccable. The environment is sublime. We would come back here again and again for special occasions if only we lived closer!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you want a nicer meal. Fig Tree is one of my favorite choices in Charlotte.   It is a beautiful old home. The service is impeccable. The food is delicious. It is cozy. Not pretentious.   We love their cheese plate. The scallops are cooked perfectly. I highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Amazing wine selection.  Impeccable service.  Had trigger fish special delicios! Others had steak filet melted in your mouth and grouper lobster combo butter drenched.  Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, but this review is more about the bar area.  It's a small area, but a nice place to stop in and meet a friend after work.  They do have bar bites, but will also let you eat from the full menu there.  I had the escargot (deconstructed with mushrooms) and some kind of meatball... I'm sorry that I don't remember the exact name of that, but they were both very delicious.  They have an extremely nice wine list.  Erica is the bartender and she was very nice and very professional."}
{"text":"Best place I've eaten in Charlotte. Great staff, amazing food, gorgeous ambience. Pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. Although more expensive than necessary, and our server was a little condescending. But overall, one of Charlotte's very best."}
{"text":"The majority aren't wrong that the food is excellent but at the same time I'm only giving four stars because there wasn't anything that left me positively blown away (and I'm trying to be more realistic about my 5 star reviews - I've been too nice).  We went on NYE and they had hats on the tables which was cute.  My boyfriend ordered the elk and was in love, I ordered the scallops and enjoyed but have had equally good scallops at other nice restaurants.  I was most impressed with their seasonal cauliflower bisque - simple but very flavorful and creamy.    Something else I particularly enjoyed about their menu is the few items that were samplers - they had oysters prepared three different ways as an appetizer, and there was also a macaron dessert with a sampling of different flavors.  I got the oysters and loved having some variety there.  I was sad that when I ordered the seasonal gingerbread crème brûlée, I had gone to the restroom before it arrived and they did a sort of deconstructed take on the traditional dessert and broke a sugar disc with a spoon rather than brûlée-ing the top of the crème and they broke it while I was gone! I was so sad (I realize as I write this how dramatic I am but I live for this sh*t in fine dining) that I missed it.  Luckily the woman at the table next to us ordered it so I was side-eyeing that disc breaking hardcore.  Worth going for sure, but my first visit didn't quite reach five stars.  I'll go again though (and I will NOT leave my seat this time!)"}
{"text":"Great special occasion restaurant with fabulous food, attentive service, and ridiculous wine list.   We went to Fig Tree for my birthday last night and really enjoyed it. The atmosphere is very intimate, but be sure to dress up a bit as you will otherwise feel out of place. Our server, Ty, was very good about making recommendations and was attentive without being annoying throughout the entire meal. On to the food....   We started with the appetizer special, which was squash flowers stuffed with ricotta cheese and pesto and then flash fried. Very, very good. We then moved on to the salad course. The house salad is delicious with the added goat cheese and homemade balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I had the halibut special, which was out of this world. So delicious and cooked to perfection. My boyfriend had the filet and said it was very good as well.   For dessert, you must, and I mean MUST, have the beignets with coffee gelato and cinnamon anglaise. I'm serious - one of the best desserts I've ever had, and that's saying a lot as I'm quite the dessert aficionado. The mixed berry bread pudding was also delicious, but if you're only ordering one dessert, go with the beignets. Or if you're ordering two desserts, get two orders of beignets. You get my point....   Parking is no problem as the restaurant has a private lot. One thing I found a bit odd is that the bathrooms are on the second level, so if you have a disability (or plan to partake in a few alcoholic beverages), please keep that little factoid in mind."}
{"text":"I took the family here for my mother's birthday.  Beautiful setting in a older refurbished arts & crafts style home with authentic period detail.  Attentive service and a wonderful menu.  My father leans toward a meat & potato meal and was a bit thrown by the elaborate sauces & sides but they accommodated with plain substitutions (i.e. Plain mashed potatoes) and everyone was happy!  The food is pricy but excellent.  Drinks were outstanding and they served my mom a special birthday dessert!  My husband and I will be back!  Great date night location."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience at The Fig Tree on Thursday night! Service was fabulous, they were very attentive and had great suggestions for wine. We started off with the escargot with mushrooms and a crostini in a gorgonzola sauce and one of the specials of the night, a gruyere tart with pickled carrots and candied walnuts. The escargot was fantastic - I could not stop dipping the made from scratch focaccia bread in the leftover sauce. The gruyere tart was tasty, but I found that the flavor of all the components were too strong when eaten separately. Once I had a bite with all components, the flavors balanced out. Entrees came with the house salad or an assortment of salads or the daily soup for an extra charge. We both went with the tomato bisque and it was to DIE FOR. You must get it if it's available! We both ordered one of the specials as our entrees--I got the cod with a mushroom and red pepper risotto with asparagus and a lemon butter caper sauce and my boyfriend ordered the ostrich with whipped potatoes and asparagus and a Roquefort sauce. While his dish was delicious (the Roquefort sauce was super flavorful and paired so well with the rest of the dish), mine left something to be desired. The lemon butter caper sauce was incredible, but the cod on it's own lacked any seasoning. The risotto was tasty but had an overwhelming red pepper taste that I wish was more subdued. We also shared the dark chocolate hazelnut tart for dessert and it was so tasty! The tart was super rich but was balanced so well with the hazelnut ice cream and the salty hazelnut brittle.  All in all, it was a good experience and I would love to return to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"excellent food,  atmosphere,  and service.   parking lot is tight but it's one of those restaurants that's worth any inconvenience to make your reservation on time."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are both simply incredible!   The restaurant is nestled inside a beautiful old home - it's charming and lovely all around. Our server was very sweet and he helped us with any request we made.   The bread is served with roasted garlic puree = heaven. I ate three or four pieces as I just couldn't say no- when asked for more!   We had two appetizers the Lobster Hushpuppies and Apple Beggar's Purse. While I enjoyed both, I probably would not get the Hushpuppies again as I couldn't really taste the lobster ( my dining partners could-so maybe it was just me). Both of these dishes are too small to split with more than two people-just an FYI.   All of the entrees come with a salad, which is very nice as I was expecting a la cart. The salad was dressed with a simple herb vinaigrette and overall really didn't require any of the additions available for an up-charge.   For my entree I went with the filet and opted for the potato gratin in lieu of fingerling potatoes. The streak was served with Stilton Cheese and Mushroom Duxelles and Wilted Arugula with a Veal Demi-Glace and Sautéed Baby Spinach. The steak was cooked perfectly and the taste was mouth-watering. It was one of the best steaks I have ever had! It was also rather large for a filet- so it you won't be left starving I promise.  I couldn't even eat dessert  I was so full although I can imagine it may be like everything else I tasted, delicious! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while in Charlotte surprising my dad for Father's Day! This is the cutest family owned restaurant with so many great options. They are able to customize so many dishes for any and all food allergies/preferences. We sat upstairs in a cozy room in the house turned restaurant. Our server was great and we even gotten surprised with dessert! It was a wonderful night will totally be back!"}
{"text":"Great and unforgettable experience celebrating our anniversary. A little bit disappointed with the sides but cheese plate, elk and Filet were amazing delicious"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! My boyfriend and I went here the other night just as a regular date night. Our server JD was more than helpful with menu items and had a very bright and cheerful personality. We shared a bottle of wine for dinner and I got the Sea Scallops which were divine. My boyfriend got the pasta dish (I forgot what it's called), but he gobbled up the whole thing so I'm assuming it was very tasty. Even the dinner salads that come prior to the entree were amazing. It is a bit pricey, but if you have nice company to share a night out with or have a hot date ;) this place is the spot to go."}
{"text":"Fantastic place with great food and atmosphere. Tired of the franchise restaurant? Well stop by and enjoy the 100 year old house and the great wine list.   I just had a company event there and the foi gras was to die for!"}
{"text":"Food: I ordered the Lobster Hush Puppies, Pumpkin Soup and Scallops for dinner. The Lobster Hush Puppies were a a little dry .  I think I got excited because it has the word \"lobster\" in it.  I couldn't really get any lobster flavor, but they were fried so you really don't taste much but  the oil and sweetness of the hush puppy anyway.   Good thing I like hush puppies.  The pumpkin soup and scallops were delicious.  The cold pumpkin soup was surprisingly good because, normally, I'm not a fan of cold soups.  It tasted fresh and light; I expected a heavier soup.  I cleaned my bowl.  You have to be careful when ordering scallops.  I find that the restaurant  either gets it perfectly or just doesn't know how to cook scallops. The scallops were amazing. They were so tender.  The chive butter sauce is delicious. D to the E to L-I-C-I-O-U-S.   Atmosphere: First rate.  The restaurant is in an old house with lots of charm. It may be a cramped but who cares?  It's more intimate that way.    Aside: I was on a business dinner.  Everything tastes better when it's free.  With that being said, if I had to pay I would probably rate it a 3 for value - great food but pricey.  In the same price range, Fig Tree would still be a the top of my list.  Rating on just food: 4 Rating on value: 3 But I'm a stingy bastard."}
{"text":"OK I am willing to fly to Charlotte for the Elk Chop alone!!  Seriously.  Best ever, ever.    Expect to pay for what you get, and savor every bite.  The location is perfect, but you will need reservations.  Period.  We also shared empanadas, which were as good as the ones I noche on in Bolivia (yes, in South America).  Nice wine list and the steaks looked lovely.  My only advice - Like all excellent restaurants DO NOT EAT THE BREAD!!  While it is awesome, why fill up on carbs when real food is on its way??"}
{"text":"We were visiting my parents in Charlotte and looked for a bit of fine dining to enjoy their company. My lovely bride found this online (here or elsewhere), and we made an online reservation. As we drove up, our hopes were confirmed, as the restaurant is in a lovely craftsman cottage. We were not to be disappointed. Please note that the restaurant is on two floors, so those with stair difficulties should request less strenuous seating (good job Mom, as we were on the second floor), though there is outdoor and first floor seating.   The following is somewhat plagaraized from my reservation site review, but rings true:  \"What a wonderful culinary meal. All items were beautifully assembled, well presented,  and most of all, delicious. All in our group of 4 found their food (all ordered in a different manner and style) to be properly and wonderfully prepared. Tying that in was the service. The waiter (ask for Zach!) was well informed, properly attentive, and had a great sense of humor. The package made for a super evening out.  The foie gras  was wonderfully tasty (though a bit to tiny, as we order from the same purveyor that the restaurant uses), and others enjoyed the trout, elk, duck and filet. The wine list was excellent. The roasted garlic puree for the focaccia, along with rosemarie olive oil was terrific.   Overall, we would not hesitate to recommend this as a gourmet dining experience that did not disappoint. FYI, we visited from out of town, and joined our parents here. My bride and I were happy with the choice we made, and expected the check."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a class all its own here in Charlotte. The food is excellent, the service is impeccable and the atmosphere is perfection! This was my second time dining here and was as impressed as the first time. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte for the first time.  Went to dinner with 2 friends Wednesday evening. Made reservations for 6pm. The fig tree is about 1 mile from the Sheraton/ let meridian.  Seated immediately. Our waitress Samantha was excellent!  Started us with complementary homemade focaccia bread and garlic butter. For appetizers we shared stuffed calamari and octopus.  Very extensive wine menu.   Bread and appetizers were excellent  I had the barramundi with lobster, and tasted the elk chops and scallops.  All 3 were outstanding!  Ended our meal with brown butter pistachio bar- red beet ice cream with honey comb and toasted candies pistachios.  Amazingly delicious.  Restaurant ambiance =5  Service = 5 Food = 5+  Highly recommend and will return if I am in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and it was wonderful. Ashley, our waitress was fantastic and answered any questions we had in regards to the menu. For an appetizer, We had the stuffed calamari which was stuffed with chorizo. My husband had the special which was veal with crab meat on top. He wasn't crazy about the veal but the crap was delicious, melt in your mouth. I had the grouper with lobster which was a hearty portion.   Fig tree is pricey and definitely a great restaurant to celebrate a special event.   Great service, great food...will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Despite glowing reviews from almost everyone for Fig Tree, I wasn't really blown away at all in my first visit. My girlfriend and I diner here with our families to celebrate her birthday and really enjoyed ourselves, but nothing about Fig Tree was great enough to justify the prices. The ambience is classy and fairly romantic, and the service was excellent. Our waiter seemed to have a strong understanding of the menu and all the options, wines, etc. We certainly never felt rushed, and the pace of the meal flowed nicely. On the downside, they incorrectly split the check twice (although they did fix both errors) and we had to ask for all of our boxed food multiple times after getting the check because of some confusion between the servers. Despite these small mistakes, I was impressed by the level of service.  The food didn't impress me as much as the service, however, and failed to live up to the high prices in my opinion. I ordered the grouper and lobster over saffron risotto. The saffron risotto was superb - perfectly creamy and very flavorful. The lobster was good but nothing special, and the grouper was a bit overcooked and pretty bland. My girlfriend ordered the veal chop, and again, it was good but nothing noteworthy. The veal was cooked perfectly to medium but lacked seasoning/flavor. The smashed potatoes on the side were excellent, however. We tried the chocolate torte and beignets for dessert. The beignets were incredible - like sweet, cinnamony donut holes ! The cinnamon glaze they come with is amazing as well, and the coffee gelato was tasty. The chocolate torte was alright but for $11, it left a lot to be desired.  Overall, despite a great ambience and solid service, the food was way too hit or miss to justify the high prices."}
{"text":"For those seeking to pass on Charlotte's high-end steak chains, Charlotte has a few \"fine dining\" restaurants with inventive preparation of locally-grown ingredients and wonderful service.  However, few of these locally-owned fine-dining restaurants (with the exception of the French restaurants which come and go) serve diners dishes which take diners on unique, culinary adventures.  For that reason, The Fig Tree keeps popping up as \"the best of the best\" of Charlotte's fine dining restaurants.   There's a reason: For those of us in Charlotte who feel the need to trek to Charleston for culinary adventures, The Fig Tree is, perhaps, the single restaurant in our own backyard which delivers the adventures we're desperate to experience.  After all, there's a reason why diners have to pre-order the elk with horseradish spaetzle and bacon-braised purple cabbage.    On my last visit, Friday March 18, I was able to land an elk dish without a pre-order, and I'm still thinking about how perfectly it was executed.  The grouper with lobster over saffron risotto and local Magret du Canard over almond, brussels sprout and date risotto were also huge hits this past Friday.  On previous visits, I've tried the lamb, veal, and locally-grown poulet rouge chicken.  All have been exceptional.  The service is as consistently outstanding as to be expected, the wine list is phenomenal, and the complete experience is always top-notch.  Friday's experience was no exception.  Yet, again, IMHO, the single factor which places The Fig Tree above all our other \"Charlotte fine-dining restaurants\" is the perfect execution of dishes we can't find anywhere else.  (Do they even serve elk in Charleston?)    One note:  I used Open Table to secure a 5:45 pm Friday night table for two.  The next available Open Table reservation that night would have been around 9:00 pm.  I know nothing about restaurant management but just offer this:  if you want to go to The Fig Tree and can't make a reservation on Open Table, by all means call the restaurant directly.  After looking around the dining room at 7:15 pm when we left, I will never trust Open Table again.  I'll call the restaurant directly."}
{"text":"I have definitely found my new favorite Charlotte restaurant. Fig Tree was everything I had been hoping for on a Friday night: the service was top notch, the food was amazing, and the ambiance was perfect. This charming restaurant actually feels more like you are in someone's home, with your own personal chef preparing your special order for you.  In contrast with the usual restaurant atmosphere, Fig Tree is much more personal. There are five different areas for you to dine: you can sit in the candlelit main area, which feels like you are in the living room of a charming home, and admire one of the three fireplaces in the house; you may eat in the back area near the beautiful bar, or you can eat outdoors on the wrap-around porch, to name a few. There are also dining areas upstairs, which I'm sure is just as cozy. We chose the porch, which was perfect.  Our waiter was totally on-point. He knew the menu in and out and was able to make great recommendations on both food and wine, and he was always right there when you needed him without being in your face. He was also very personable and made us feel at home right away. If you are a red wine drinker, order the bottle of the Malbec by Paul Hobbs - you will not be disappointed.   We started off with oysters, (which were a special that night), and they were delicious - 6 different oysters prepared three different ways, and I can't remember all of them but I do remember feta and spinach, gorgonzola on one, and just deliciousness all around. We also ordered the Lobster Hushpuppies, which we ate so fast I almost can't give an accurate review of them - all I can tell you is Y-U-M. For my main course I had the halibut, which was completely out-of-control - sauteed, topped with lobster and lobster butter sauce, with asparagus - every bite was delicious, and I couldn't get enough of it.   We didn't have room for dessert, but I have no doubt that it would've been phenomenal, as was everything else with this place. While the Fig Tree is pricey, I would definitely check it out on a night you could swing it and would recommend it over most restaurants I've been to in Charlotte, without a doubt."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely excellent here. The service is some of the best in the city!! My only complaint is that the lighting is poor in some of the first floor rooms and the tables are a little close together. Ask for a table on the second floor."}
{"text":"As typical of the Charlotte restaurant scene...only a solid ok. Again, another 2-3 restaurant rated at 4+...The Wait staff was awesome and that's what makes it shine. Beautifully sculpted food with ok flavor."}
{"text":"The whole experience was amazing. We started with the ginger martini and the sparkling pear. The drinks were delicious and a perfect balance between sweet, sour, and strong. We ordered both the escargot in a Gorgonzola cream sauce and the foie gras with bacon praline. Both were amazing and our waitress did an excellent job pairing a wine selection with each. As for entrees I ordered the rabbit saltimbocca and my husband ordered the elk chop. While my rabbit was quite yummy the elk was out of this world perfectly cooked, seasoned well, and melt in your mouth tender. We finished the meal with the chocolate Aztec cake, rich moist and spicy. It was served with a delicious horchata ice cream. The best restaurant I have had the pleasure of dining at in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I \"like\" a lot of places, but there are few that I love.  I am happy to say that The Fig Tree is one restaurant that I love!  Yes, it's pricy, but worth it for a special occasion.  The food is superior to anything else I've had in Charlotte.  It's not gimmicky or trendy, it's straight forward delicious cuisine with a touch of flair!  I did a blog post about my NYE meal which you can read here: http://theladyolive.com/2014/01/03/nye-at-the-fig-tree/  It had been a couple of years since I was lucky enough to be wined and dined at The Fig Tree and I was so excited! The food and service are top notch.  One of my favorite appetizers in the apple beggar's purse: flaky pastry filled with gorgonzola and served with apples.  My favorite sweet and salty combination.  I've never had anything I didn't love.  The filet I ordered was cooked and seasoned absolutely perfectly.    The wine lists is huge! Definitely a good place to take your wino friends."}
{"text":"Came here for work event. Had the duck liver and elk chop. I would not recommend the duck liver unless you've had it before. Thankfully they serve it with a piece of bacon to help control some of the livers \"squirmy-ness.\" The elk chop was okay. I've had elk numerous times in Denver, and this was not comparable to the elk out there. Mine was much more well down than I would've liked. Perhaps a cooking error, but I wasn't impressed based on the reputation of this place.  The wait staff was awesome. Probably one of the best waiters I've had and was able to answer every question we had without consulting others.   Price - overpriced for what I received. Elk was about 50, and duck liver was 20."}
{"text":"Everyone is entitled to there opinion but I can't see how anyone could be displeased with this restaurant (as another reviewer has suggested). Sure, every establishment can have an \"off night\" but I find it hard to believe The Fig Tree is such a place. In fact, by this review I am hoping to help spread the word about this hidden gem in Charlotte. We went on a Tuesday night - probably their slowest night of the week - but we were still treated to what I would describe as art on a plate. The restaurant was decorated for the Christmas Holiday and the gas fireplace was lit. In other words, the mood was set. The heavy copper-bound menus were succinct but descriptive. We started with the lobster hushpuppy appetizer (which we were told has never been off the menu since the beginning) and they were delicious. More like a conch fritter than a hushpuppy but a perfect start. My wife ordered the seared scallops and I order their popular Osso Bucco. My wife rarely finishes everything, but she absolutely cleaned her plate on this visit. The scallops were tender, mild with just enough sauce. Coupled with truffle mashed potatoes she said it was one of the best meals she had ever had. My Osso Bucco was delicious as well. It was cooked and accompanied by foods that spoke more of \"Pot Roast\" than the traditional Italian method, but that's a good thing. On a cold night it was perfect. The shank was fork tender and I later quipped to the waiter that I didn't need the steak knife he placed in front of me - it just fell off the bone. It was accompanied with Spinach Speatzle which was a nice compliment to the gravy it floated in. The evening was topped off with a seasonal Gingerbread Bread Pudding that was incredible. I asked for the recipe and gave them my email address. My fingers are crossed I receive it."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting and ambiance..Service was outstanding..Fantastic wine list..  Apple Beggar's Purse are a must.. Trout was really wonderful.. My friend has the fish of the day and raved about it..  Bon Appetit.."}
{"text":"One of my most memorable meals in Charlotte.  The bread with garlic spread that they serve is amazing.  Would adore that recipe.  The house is quaint and would be awesome for a romantic evening.  Reservations are a must.  Everything we had that night was simply amazing.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fig Tree has an A+ outdoor patio dining area and the interior is gorgeous as well.  If you're into historic homes that might be reason enough to dine at this restaurant.  There are actual fig trees growing out front and we harvested a couple late season volunteers which were perfectly sweet and went well with our cocktails (mine: the vodka jalapeno weak and disappointing, my husband's: whiskey cocktail right on target).   We had the special chicken liver mousse app which was really light, creamy, and perfectly flavored. The NC local trout pan seared and topped with lump crab meat was a steal at $30; perfect balance of flavors, hearty portion, and super fresh. My husband's sweet potato pasta was fresh and interesting but a bit on the overwhelmingly sweet side.   The server brought fresh baked bread throughout the meal and it was delicious; totally worth filling up on.  We ordered the lemon grass panna cotta which was one of the better panna cottas I've had in a while - very delicate and a nice tribute to an herb that you rarely see outside of eastern Asian menus.   Servers are attentive and professional, if a bit chilly.  Overall I would recommend The Fig Tree for a nice night out in Charlotte - great for a special occasion, date night, etc."}
{"text":"The Fig Tree is one of those Elizabeth area homes-turned-restaurant, where a husband and wife wile away the days gracing Charlotte diners with an ambrosial experience fitted to their ever-changing whim. The house itself is a quaint cathedral: rich hardwoods and heavy ceiling beams lending geometry to moss-flat midnight green walls, all stationed heavy around the gorgeous gray-brick of the tall fireplace. White-shirted staffers gracefully maneuver between the tight-spaced long tables, aprons ascoff, delicate hands keeping bottles flowing, and candle and laughter all else left to fill the space.  Not one accustomed to much fanciness, I relied on Xan and her upright properness to show me the way. Upon reception, our hostmistress - a diminutive, Mediterranean sprite, all done up in black against her olive skin and obsidian wave - checked our coats and handed us a number. I fought to keep my eyebrows from rising. We were profiled, the only ones yet there under the age of forty, and escorted to the far seats of a long table in the back of the second dining room. Given that guests must be seated together, I appreciated that our porter recognized we might not be the toothiest of patrons.  Our first glass, a delightful Sauvignon Blanc, was poured well in advance of the first course. Though I knew to save it for the meal, I'm a nervous drinker. So I downed it post-haste. \"Would it be uncouth to order additional drinks?\" I asked Xan quietly across the white-linened table. Behind us, a server approached a table of well-dressed Sicilians carrying a tray filled with Martinis, Champagne flutes, and some fuzzy-red cocktails. \"No, I think we're good,\" Xan quipped. I ordered a couple gins-n-tonic. A trio of thirty-ish dames were led in and ushered down in the seats next to us. One, a blazered judaical with tight pony and classy flair sat next to Xan. Beside her, a broad-nosed mousey blond. And to my right, a pale little midwesterner with jet-black bangs fronting her mushroom bob. I gave them each a clever wink. \"Welcome to the kids table, ladies.\"  The handsome Jewish woman, a litigator, puzzled my quip. She then momentarily glanced around the room, assessing, and then back to Xan and me. \"We ARE at the kids table, aren't we?\" she said. I nodded and grinned.  The waiter returned with our gins - strong and crisp, as they should be. I snapped it back with a sigh and gestured a lifted toast toward Xan. She too presented. The first course was rolled out soon thereafter - North Atlantic Pan-Seared Striped Bass over King Crab Ravioli and Spicy Creole Sauce. My mouth watered at the sight, and then drooled overflowing at the first taste. My eyes glistened and I closed-mouth bobbed my head up and down in Xan's direction. \"Mmm, hmmm.\" She agreed. Our trio of table-mates, too, enjoyed the course. And ours being long swilled, let us know that the Sauvignon Blanc served as fitting accompaniment.  Our second course brought us Barlow's Merlot along with Poulet Rouge Chicken Confit over Kalamata Olive Polenta Cake with Smokey Tomato Sauce. It also brought me my second gin-n-tonic. My palate seared and sweltered, overcome by the onslaught of smoke and savor. \"Too much,\" I slurred. \"Just too much.\"  Course 3 brought us a healthy glass of a rich Cabernet Sauvignon and a Red Wine Braised Short Rib over top Corona Bean Stew. Of the courses, we universally found this the least appealing. Though still delicious, the rib was neither tender nor tough, and the bean stew felt ordinary compared to what we'd already been offered. I asserted, though, that this may have been intentional. Like when a band plays a few hits in a row, then throws a couple obscure b-tracks at you, just to set you up for inevitable crowd-pleasing fan-favorite finale.  Course four put us over the top: Barrouge (Barlow's table red) paired to a Roasted Duck Breast over Quinoa and Macadamia Nuts with Pomegranate-Port Gastrique. Giddy, nearly comatose, and teetering like jackal, I devoured the duck with no pause toward class or reason. It filled me like a balloon, full up and floating high with fatty, nutty goodness. That one really did it.  \"Wait,\" the mousey blonde interrupted. \"Nothing so far has had bacon... why no bacon?\" She was completely serious. I laughed, then considered. We all did.  \"Bacon might have made sense with the short rib,\" said the litigator, \"but not the others.\"  \"But doesn't bacon go with everything?\" asked the mushroom-bob.  I shook my head. \"Bacon's a cruel temptress,\" I offered, \"sometimes perfect, sometimes overpowering... she should be enjoyed with cautious reserve.\"  \"You miss Hux, don't you?\" Xan said.  \"I do. But, I'm truly glad it's you here and not her.\" Xan smiled. Dessert was a Carrot Cake lined with Cream Cheese and Grilled Pineapple. Though not quite a match for the fourth gin-n-tonic I paired with it, my system appreciated the unusual influx of sugar and carb. Before we left, I toasted our trio of new friends: \"To the absence of bacon.\""}
{"text":"I really don't understand all the rave reviews for this restaurant.  Some of my favorite restaurants are prime steakhouses like, Del Frisco's and The Palm so maybe my standards are a little high but I do like trying local independent restaurants so I thought I would give the Fig Tree a try.    The menu here is very diverse and contains items you typically will not find in most restaurants like Ostrich and Elk, however, the quality, in my opinion is average at best.  The starter salad did not taste fresh and was very bland.  The Elk was so tough I had to ask the server to bring me a sharper knife so I could cut into it.  The two sides served with the Elk were strange and also very bland.    The atmosphere and the service was exceptional, however, because of my food experience I will not be dining at The Fig again."}
{"text":"Ehhh. It is overrated and over priced. I've had much better. Very cramped space. One plus is tag background music wasn't blaring so you could actually talk to the people you are eating with. I had the chicken dish. It was good, nothing spectacular. My husband had the veal chops, medium rare, they were ok."}
{"text":"I'm using my wife's Yelp account to write this review as we had an extremely disappointing experience at the Fig Tree. My wife and I recently purchase a new house, we came to Charlotte for an overnight trip for furniture shopping from the Research Triangle, and to explore the Charlotte culinary world.   For my main course, I selected the filet mignon. The arrangement of sauteed spinach, three boiled halves of fingerling potatoes, and a drizzle of a supposed demiglace accompanied a sizable filet saturated with a confused broil of mushroom duxelles and blue cheese. While cooked to an acceptable medium-rare, the protein was grossly underseasoned to the point that the intense saltiness of the mushrooms and duxelle could only elevate this to the point of mutedness. In the end, if a dish a simple as filet mignon was so poorly executed.  Throughout my initial few bites, I had debated on whether to reveal my displeasure to my wife. Looking at her lavishly stacked veal chop, I decided to not ruin the moment with her pure eye candy of a dish with my pedantic complaints. \"I can't eat this anymore,\" I then heard. My partner similarly complained of the lack of seasoning of her dish, further noting her inability to cut the meat and its utmost chewiness. After trying myself, I agreed on almost every account: the veal lacked any form of salt, and the constant encounters with the sinew that laced the meat made even the least desired cuts of beef or pork seem luxurious. However, what was of more concern was that as we hacked our way through the cut, the meat near the bone of the chop become both increasingly raw and bloody to the point of inedibility.  What bothered us the most was, in fact, the SERVICE! There were some rather dubious interactions that occurred throughout our meal that not only devastated my partner, but actually ended up bothering me to a degree.  Initially, we had not noticed any major flaws with the waiter until he started serving other tables. Notably, when the waiter served us bread, he did not explain anything about the bread or the butter to us. It was until he served another table next to us that we heard that the butter was actually garlic, rosemary and something else (couldn't hear clearly). When he took the order from my wife, who is a foreigner, he sounded annoyed when he needed to repeat the three types of salad. After the meal, we informed our waiter after a longer period of inattentiveness, and he offered little remorse. Pointing out the blandness and chunks of raw, bloody meat, he simply said \"you know, this is how the meat gets when it's close to the bone\", walked away, and proceeded to hand us dessert menus as if our complaint of the unacceptability of the dish simply was as likely as discarded and forgotten as those uncooked remnants of that poor calf. Of course, I am aware of the difficulty of cooking meat near the bone. However, I feel like this shouldn't be something I'd expect from a seasoned professional of a fine dining establishment.  Being confused at the substandard attitude of the service and experience with the food prior, we decided to skip the ever-so-famed beignets. After awaiting our waiter to return to our table after clearing away the tables of and striking conversation with our neighboring diners, we decline any dessert options, he simply walked away and returned with our checks. When our neighboring tables also declined dessert afterwards, even with one individual rudely responding to the waiter's remarks, the waiter made light of the situation by including some humorous aspect of the respective decline. Yet only to add insult to injury, not only was the full price of the complained veal still present, but my partner's supposedly included salad was added as an additional cost.  I'm not necessarily sure for what reason our waiter decided to don his bigotry pants and belittling shirt when serving our table. Whether it was the fact of asking questions about the contents of certain dishes, the fact that my partner was not holding a designer handbag like the other ladies from our neighboring tables, the fact that we actually complained about our meals, or even the fact that my partner is Chinese and somehow had problem understanding the waiter when he took her order. In any case, the cold attitude of the waiter and the lack of any culinary integrity of the meal left my wife in tears by the end of the meal. One never dreams of seeing their partner in such disarray, and her visceral distaste of her experience instantly shredded any form of complacency I may have previously held with my experience.  Needless to say, we've come to the conclusion that we'd just rather not just not dine in Charlotte at all than try to give this restaurant another chance. If that means that one more person has the opportunity to frivolously waste their money on the pseudo-promise of a world class meal, then I will rest slightly easier at night."}
{"text":"Wonderful birthday dinner. The menu is interesting, local and broad. Nice wine list and attentive service. They even added a special chocolate Happy Birthday message to our desert. Our favorites were the appetizers, escargot and carpaccio, both were outstanding. My husband tried the elk but wasn't a fan, although it was very well prepared. I definitely will go back to experience the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Long overdue review of The Fig Tree!  Hubs and I went to the beloved Fig Tree to celebrate our 5 year anniversary.  This place was well suited for the occasion and I was excited to try it out for the first time.  I would say that my expectations were middle of the road just to be safe so that I wasn't disappointed.  I left satisfied and I left with a good impression!    I love the location of the restaurant.  It seems to be tucked away in the lovely neighborhood of Elisabeth inside an old house.  (please correct me if I'm wrong)  The hostess greeted us with warm smiles and immediately said \"Happy Anniversary\" without me saying anything.  I looked at Hubs and he just winked.  Sweet hubby.  Anywho, our table was set outside on the porch and I melted away with the outside atmosphere.  Our waiter was like a revolving door...every time it was time to change forks, plates, glasses....he rolled in with ease and then quickly rolled away without even disturbing our conversation.  Beautifully done.  My table etiquette needs a little help, but he was gracious.  On to the food -   The first course was Lobster Hush puppies and they were ....just OK.  They tasted better with the sauce that was drizzled on the plate but it was too spicy for me.  So I opted for just eating them plain.  No biggie.  Next up was my beloved Halibut.  I heart seafood and I couldn't wait for this meal.  I asked the waiter for a wine pairing and he suggested a Chardonnay that was pretty popular with most.  I'm not a Chardonnay drinker, however the ones I've had, were suggested by waiters and I've liked them.  So I figured I'd be safe with this one as well.  Not.so.much.  I should have just stuck with Pinot Grigio.  BUT I'm glad I tried it.  I'll try anything at least one time!  Halibut was amazing.  So good.  So light. So fresh...so....*insert all other adjectives that describes awesomeness*  Hubs got the steak of course and it was cooked perfectly and he loved it as well.  I loved my experience at The Fig Tree.  For a night, we felt like we were in a different city/state and it was a very relaxed atmosphere.  Good food, good people, good company, great choice!    WARNING:  It's expensive to eat here, however, if you are aware of that and go in knowing that, you won't be shell-shocked when the bill comes."}
{"text":"Dear God,  Thank you for making this restaurant!  I had the best meal ever!  It was ALL delicious!  Amen, Deanna"}
{"text":"Me and my husband are vegetarians , chef made a special main dish for one of us but it was not good at all. Appetizer was awesome  , it was beet root dish actually  forgot the name. We actually went there for our anniversary and chef made a special writing  on our dessert. Dessert was ok.Loved the overall experience of our special day .if you are vegetarians pasta was my recommendation here."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, excellent food.  I came to Charlotte on business. A friend of mine and I came to the Fig Tree and hopes of having a really nice meal. They did not disappoint. Once here we couldn't decide on an entrée originally we were both thinking scallops but then when our waitress told us the specials we were dying for the bass too.   We decided that we would each get one and ultimately divide between us and share. Well imagine our surprise when we had 2 complete meals delivered to us in halved portions. Amazing.  For dessert we had the 'beignets', while not what you traditionally think of when you hear beignets, they were excellent with the cafe gelato   Enough said! Food was delicious service was excellent, thanks for the great meal."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - five stars.  Food - two stars.  Value - zero stars.  Fig Tree is in a beautiful old home, and I think it is the prettiest (and most romantic) restaurant I have been to in Charlotte.  Sadly, spending time in the house requires that you eat the food - and that's not something you really want to subject yourself to...  There are some positives to mention about Fig Tree.  I have been there for dinner on two separate occasions.  Each time, the service was good.  At the first meal, our server was particularly attentive and friendly.  A HUGE positive in Fig Tree's favor is that they do try very, very hard to provide great customer service.  Before my first visit I called the restaurant to ask about vegetarian options.  I spoke with someone from the kitchen, and he assured me that they could provide options that were not on the menu.  I was very impressed.    I have also been very impressed with the wine/champagne that I have had at Fig Tree.  At the first dinner, we had a half bottle of Lang and Reed Cab. Franc.  It is really hard to find, and it is an incredible treat when I get the chance to have it.  The second dinner I went to was a champagne dinner, and the champagne pairings were wonderful.    Sadly, the food at Fig Tree has been a major disappointment.  At my first meal, I ordered a special which included a steak and a crab cake.  The steak was mediocre.  There was very little flavor, and the quality of the meat seemed totally inappropriate for the type of restaurant that Fig Tree aspires to be.  (To be fair, my vegetarian companion enjoyed her pasta dish.)  If the steak was mediocre, then the crab cake didn't get close to being mediocre.  It was one of the worst crab cakes I have ever had - at any restaurant.  I was shocked.  On my second visit to Fig Tree a friend was treating me to a champagne dinner.  I literally can't remember a single course... Not a good sign for such a memorable event.    I feel as though I have to try Fig Tree one more time, for so many people seem to love this restaurant... But, for now, I would recommend that you spend your money elsewhere if you are looking for a restaurant for a special evening."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with an awesome wine list that's reasonably priced.  VERY friendly service with delicious food.  I had the Foie Gras, Caesar salad (perfect portion), Elk and a cheese plate.  Every course was awesome and was perfectly paired with a delicious bottle of Nickel & Nickel cab.  Did I mention they have an extensive wine list (not so big for Italian)?  Will definitely go back when in Charlotte and will most likely have the same exact meal (but the lamb, veal and Rib eye were on my target list too)."}
{"text":"This is probably the best meal I have had in Charlotte. The special that I had was the bison with mushroom risotto. The flavor was savory with a subtle earthy tone. The seared outer layer made the dish. My wife got the duck and it was sweet and balanced. Our server 'Zach' (sp) was outstanding. He was very well versed on the menu and cocktail menu. The specialty appetizer was out of this world! The lobster crab cheesecake sounds crazy but it was truly unbelievable. Definitely get the beignets! New Orleans doesn't hold a candle to these beignets! Go here! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent! My sister took me there for my birthday and it started off great as we were greeted with a sincere happy birthday and a run down of the specials. Ordered some cocktails, the ruby red martini which has all my favorite flavors (grapefruit and st. Germaine)-delicious! Plus it was served in a proper size glass...I have ordered martinis before and felt like i was jipped b/c it was in a glass made for Barbie with only 2 sips-not here! They brought out some homemade bread with roasted garlic purée and rosemary infused olive oil-delicious separately, even better combined!  Started with the Apple Beggars Purse...Gorgonzola, walnuts, caramelized onion, puffed pastry-with some kind of sauce...what's not to love! Then came out a salad with their herb vinaigrette (though I had to ask for a little extra dressing)-they offer fresh ground pepper and freshly grated Parmesan which is a very nice touch! Next I ordered the scallops with couscous, golden raisins, capers, crispy prosciutto, on a cauliflower purée.  My sister ordered the lamb with fig and almond risotto and a balsamic reduction. Both were perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor! Lastly, even though, we were full, there is always room for dessert! Beignets it is! Warm fluffy doughnuts, covered in cinnamon sugar, along the side of cinnamon glazes and a side of homemade coffee ice cream! Yum! The service was amazing! Attentive, engaging, but not over bearing. Do all the special added touches as the crumb scraping, the pepper, the cheese, the Birthday...I was impressed all the way around! Now when can I go back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  It is located in an old house off of 7th that is just stunning inside.  Although expensive, the food is worth every penny.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants the best of the best."}
{"text":"The food, wine and service are top-notch. You cannot go wrong at The Fig Tree.  It is pricey, but one of those places where the service, food and wine list deserve it.  Great for a romantic evening or dinner with friends.  Or even a stop for a glass of wine on the way home.  Life is short, get the cheese plate..."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner after hearing rave reviews, and this restaurant certainly lived up to its name!   We had reservations, which I highly suggest making, even for a Sunday, just to be on the safe side. We started with the scallop appetizer, which I highly recommend. There were two scallops and they were absolutely delicious! The crust on top, paired with the sweet potato/potato concoction was melt in your mouth phenomenal and I wish I had 10 of them. For the entree, my husband when with the elk. He loved it, and said medium rare was the perfect temperature. The sides, he said, weren't matching the caliber of the elk, with the spaetzle taking like straight smoke. I ordered the grouper with lobster, and the grouper was clearly fresh and prepared beautifully. I also loved the black rice it was served with, both in taste and color contrast to the white grouper and lobster.   We passed on their desserts, even though they sounded amazing, as we had some frozen wedding cake for our one year anniversary. The servers provided us with two small truffles, that tasted like fall heaven. They even wrote happy anniversary on our plate in chocolate. It's the touches like that that make the fig tree the place that it is. I highly recommend it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Old house renovated into a restaurant near Elizabeth area.  It is very pricey, good for a special occasion like an anniversary.  But it's a one and done type of spot, you experience it once and move on.  This is due to the prices...outrageous.  The Caesar salad, soup, and bread were ok, nothing special. Same with the drinks and cocktails...don't waste your $$$.  My husband ordered the duck, I'm not a big fan.  He said it was just ok. When I tried it, it was very chewy.  But I am giving this place 4 stars because of two things: 1. The service is OUTSTANDING.  2.  I did have some of they best lamb chops ever for my dinner.  The lamb chops are definitely my recommendation to you, order them well-done and they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I love the uniqueness, yet classic approach to this restaurant.  It is set in a beautiful, historic house.  It is a great place for a date.  The dishes were approachable, without feeling pretentious.  The foie gras I had was my first experience and it was awesome.  We had great service - all around, one of the best restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This was the third or fourth time we've been here and it was to celebrate our tenth anniversary so it was kind of a big deal for us. Every other visit has been nothing short of all around excellence but, this experience was not very good.  Starting off the service was not as good as it's been previously. They have always struck an excellent balance of letting you take your time but arriving right when you need something. Last night was a bit slow though. No big deal, maybe just a slightly off night. It happens.   The food was excellent as always, no surprises there thankfully. The elk chop was fantastic as was my wife's grouper and lobster. The beignets were excellent as well.   The wheels came off when a giant palmetto bug (that's a nice way of saying roach) ran down the window ledge next to our table. Now I should clarify we are inside the house, not on the porch. A bit off putting to say the least. In their defense there had just been a heavy down pour that apparently washed it out of its hiding place.  We quickly flagged down a waiter who tried to grab it with a napkin but, missed and it scurried down between the table and wall. We were promptly relocated to the bar with our drinks while we waited for the check and told \"it's just a palmetto bug. The rain drives them out.\"  We then waited for a pretty long while for someone to come get the check. Finally I got up and took it to the bartender. He asked if everything was ok and I told him a giant roach just crawled down the wall at our table to which he replied \"oh... it's a palmetto bug\". We got our check and we're told \"thanks for coming in, hopefully we'll see you again.\" And that was that.   I'm not one to look for something for free but, really? A restaurant of this caliber and that's how you handle this? Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, located just across from the Boy Scout HQ on 7th street. Lovely renovated home that is native to this area. Cozy seating areas upstairs and down, along with outdoor seating. The menu is amazing, and the wine list is one of the better lists I have seen in Charlotte.The escargot was a major winner. The Gorgonzola sauce was out of this world. We used every bit of extra bread to make sure to leave no sauce uneaten. For main course, I had the tuna and my boyfriend had the Elk Chop. Both were prepared perfectly to temperature.  The wait staff is very knowledgeable, and friendly. They make you feel welcome, and can speak intelligently to the menu. Overall, a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband is a huge meat eater and has been wanting to come to The Fig Tree for the elk so we settled on coming it for a recent date night. As far as ambiance and service, this place is amazing. Where it is a tad underwhelming to me is the actual food. I ordered a veal special that including mushrooms, spinach and other tasty toppings. My husband ordered the elk.   I thought mine was good but nothing too amazing. It also didn't come with a side so we ended up adding whipped potatoes to our order. Everything I ordered was pretty good but not anything that wowed me. My husband liked his meal a lot. He commented on the sear on the outside of his elk being tasty but also on the portion being smaller than he expected (and smaller than the pictures we had seen on Yelp). In the end, he gives the overall experience and food 4 stars and I give it 3. While it was good, nothing (in my opinion) warranted the steep prices. For me, there are much more memorable high end spots on Charlotte that I would rather go to."}
{"text":"Great little place with a lot of historic charm.  Our server was knowledgable on the entire menu and came prepared with recommendations for pairing with wine.  I ordered the veal chop and it was delicious. Cooked to perfection! My date had the elk chop and it was seasoned well!"}
{"text":"Were we all at the same restaurant?! I really don't get how this is one of the top rated restaurants in Charlotte, unless everyone just really gets their rocks off by paying a lot of money for really bland and often texturally unappealing food. Maybe the folks enjoying it were drunk off the ambiance, which is lovely, or the attentive (at times overly so ) service. Because when a side dish is the only thing you remotely even remember having flavor, that's a bad sign.We came to this place on our hunt for the best restaurants in Charlotte and were left even more lost than when we arrived.  My companion and I started with the foie gras, and the veal carpaccio, a caesar salad each, and for the entrees the grouper, and upon the suggestion of nearly everyone on yelp, Thrillist, and our waitress, we got the elk chop. Guys, the elk chop?! REALLY?! But I'll get to more on that later.   Firstly, our starters...the foie was a seared piece that somehow managed to have less than zero flavor. I didn't even think it was possible for foie gras to be this tasteless. And it was texturally nothing more than mush. I have had quite a few renditions of foie gras in my life yet I have not had one quite as disappointing as this one. The veal carpaccio had no seasoning whatsoever. The garnishes looked lovely but failed to act as a compliment or to enrich the flavor (or lack of) of the veal but rather seemed a distraction for how utterly bland the limp slices of veal were. If this is what veal carpaccio always tastes like they might want to rethink the protein choice as it had the flavor and texture of what I imagine raw chicken would have. I had almost entirely forgot we had salads, the romaine was crisp but barely dressed at all. It might as well have been a plate of lettuce, a couple croutons, and some of the most devoid of flavor anchovies I've ever encountered. I don't even like my salads doused in dressing but come on ...this was a bit ridiculous.   Now for the entrees...the grouper was sinfully under seasoned and its accompaniments so underwhelming that I can't even remember what they were. But the elk chop was probably the worst of all. Cooked at the chefs recommendation to what appeared to be a tad south of medium rare, you would have thought it was cooked north of well done considering the amount of sawing that had to go into procuring even a single bite off of this monstrosity. That should have been red flag #1 of how inedible this hunk of meat was because my futile attempt at chewing it led nowhere except into my napkin. I can't even say \"well at least it had a nice flavor\" either because it didn't. No seasoning whatsoever. The meat should be able to stand on its own, I shouldn't have to drown it in the little bit of sauce that was spooned on the plate or ensure my fork also included the spaetzle and cabbage in order to convince my mouth I was eating something other than a piece of shoe leather. And even those factors didn't help that much. The horseradish spaetzle and bacon braised red cabbage were tasty but hardly worth the $40+ price tag. The one good thing I will say is that the complementary house made focaccia was good...but I didn't go there for bread.  So there you have it. Utterly let down by a \"fine dining\" establishment that mind bogglingly has managed to rank as one of the top rated restaurants in my home town. It pisses me off that they charge this much for this lackluster food when you could eat at Kindred, a place that could clearly teach them a thing or two about how to make good food, TWICE for what a meal at Fig Tree will set you back ( or about 20 times at Prices chicken coop!). The two stars are merely for good service, and ambiance but I can think of a handful of places with better service and several spots with better ambiance and anyways guys, shouldn't it really be about the food?! Food  D- Ambiance A Service B"}
{"text":"Yep! Still one of my favorite restaurants in all of Charlotte. The service is top notch as they pay attention to every fine little detail including pouring the water.   The house sets a great mood that transports you into a wonderful atmosphere unrivaled by any place in Charlotte. It is a great place to have a fancy dinner date and enjoy your evening.  The food was downright just above almost every  place in Charlotte as the texture and quality went hand and hand. I truly can't wait to come back to try different things!   I got the filet mignon med rare and it was by textbook  what a filet should look like and taste. The scallops were so buttery and light that they melted in my mouth!!   Seriously I don't believe you can go wrong here with anything. It is the perfect date night ."}
{"text":"Pros- The wine menu is extensive and very good.  The food is good and the menu is somewhat interesting.  The location is convenient and the building is historical.  Cons - not really cons per say, nothing negative to blast or harp on:  the food was fine, but not stunning for the price points.  The service was sufficient, but not particularly warm or inviting.  The decor was fine, but not really special or interesting.  It was fine, but not really fabulous."}
{"text":"A great restaurant needs to balance the three legged stool of Food, Atmosphere, and Service and The Fig Tree accomplishes all three. We've lived all over the US and have been to many outstanding restaurants, this is one of them.   The food was excellent, the atmosphere very cozy, and the service excellent.   I took my wife there for her birthday and it was romantic. And, unlike many restaurants in LA, New York, Paris where the tables are inches from each other, we had a very private table and could talk freely.   Also reasonable price for the quality.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow. Seriously. Even a day later I am thinking about this place. First of all, it is a cool little converted house that makes an awesome setting.  Second, the service was amazing, as i would expect in a place like this, but don't always get. A shout out to our waiter Curt, and his assistant whose name I forgot (sorry!!!!) because they were attentive and fun, and their recommendations were spot on. Finally, the food. The starter of escargot in Gorgonzola sauce was so good I threatened to stab Curt if he took it away before we mopped all the sauce up with bread. The Caesar salad topped with calamari was ridiculously tasty. And the main dishes were amazing. I got the grouper and lobster. It was a classic dish, light on the seasoning and sauce, but pure and fresh in taste. My wife got the best one though- lobster Rockefeller.  Dear gawd. That was seriously delicious. Desert was some chocolate thing that was decadent as well, but we were having the 100 year port flight and i couldn't think straight at that point because it tasted so good. Well done Fig Tree!!!  You didn't miss a single thing."}
{"text":"Best local restaurant I've been to in Charlotte. The service was friendly and  quick. The food was outstanding...yes it was pricey but worth it. I've eaten there multiple times with my wife and in a group of 14 and each time the same great food and service."}
{"text":"Great date night restaurant. I loved coming here and experiencing the full spectrum of their menu: wine, appetizers, meal and dessert. The atmosphere, service, and food all deserve 5 stars. If you are looking for nice restaurant to have dinner or special place to celebrate, make a reservation @ Fig Tree."}
{"text":"We went here on a pre-Father's Day date where I had selected the restaurant based on its 4.5 star reviews (being new to the area). The Fig Tree exceeded even those expectations and nailed it every step of the way. Ambiance was quaint and romantic, Service was exceedingly professional and equally comfortable and all our dishes and appetizers were flavorful \", original and perfectly prepared. We're definitely going back! (and the price was honestly well within reason)"}
{"text":"This place is everything you hope a restaurant would be and more.  The restaurant is  beautiful on the outside and makes you feel like you are stepping into someone's home.  It is fancy, but not too fancy.  When my husband and I walked in, I was greeted with such a warm smile from the hostess.  While walking to our table, we were able to view the other rooms that were decorated in different ways.  My husband had informed me that each room had a different theme.  The ambiance from the whole restaurant was just perfect.   I very much enjoyed our waiter.  He was very nice the whole time and didn't seem to be annoyed when I had asked a lot of questions about the menu.  He was also very kind in helping me pick out a wine, and also asked for what price range I was trying to stay in since he knew everything was expensive.  I felt like he was helping us look out for our wallets.    All the food was amazing.  I just fell in love with the Escargot appetizer.  It was beautifully prepared that you would forget you were eating snail.  All of the food was a good portion size for what you are paying for.  Everything had a tasty flavor and was just perfection.  This place is a bit on the pricey side, but I would say that everyone should at least try it once in their life time.  Sharing it for a special occasion would be well worth it with great memories in a beautifully cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"This was a true five-star experience. I'll admit, it makes me sound a bit naive, but this was my first time dining anywhere this nice. The lady and I were celebrating our 3 year anniversary, and we had reservations already booked. I think this is probably the only way to eat here... From the second that we stepped in the house, we were treated like true guests. Our glasses were ALWAYS filled, and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and personable. He gave wonderful recommendations, laughed with us, and celebrated our anniversary with us.  As far as the food goes, what I was most pleased about was the portion size. I tend to have the conception that high price point food is often portioned on the small size, but not here. We started with the Apple Beggar's Purse, which was excellent. I think we want to try to recreate that dish at home as well, if we can! For the main course, I ordered the ostrich (because really, when else am I going to eat Ostrich?) and the lady ordered the chicken. Both were absolutely wonderful, everything from the protein to the accompanying dishes. In between meals, we were provided with wonderful salted Focaccia bread and a roasted garlic paste that was as much of a palette cleanser as it was a treat.  For dessert, of course, we ordered the Beignets, and were treated with the words \"Happy Anniversary!\" written in dark chocolate sauce. I knew that was coming, but it was still really special to get at our table. This is a wonderful date night location, and everybody around us seemed to be celebrating something. Highly recommended. Thank you for making our experience so memorable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, and very, very good food. The wine list is interesting - not massive but a very varied selection across all price ranges and full of non-mainstream choices.   The oyster on special we had were impeccable - obviously that's about the sourcing, but the frozen mignonette was a delightful addition.   The Elk chop was beautifully cooked, with a magnificent sauce and really lovely sides. The lamb unfortunately was overcooked - not served at the requested medium rare - but they were happy to replace it but both diners declined. Still the sauce and sides drew raves.  So, a less than perfect meal but still a delightful experience , and I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Upon entering The Fig Tree Restaurant, I was told that they were fully booked for the evening. Luckily, there were open spots at the bar. After sitting down, the bartender took my order in a timely fashion.   I was surprised to see ostrich on the menu. Never having eaten ostrich, I just had to get it. The ostrich had a rough texture, perhaps being most similar to beef. It tasted similar to a lean steak but with a slight distinct flavor. Regardless, the brandy-green peppercorn sauce that accompanied it added the perfect amount of flavor to the ostrich. The lentils complemented the ostrich, but I didn't feel that the lentils really added any additional flavor or character to the dish."}
{"text":"I am not going to keep this review long winded but Fig Tree is the best restaurant in town.  Never a bad meal, amazing service.  Mark the bar manager is amazing, knows everyone and knows how to make you feel special.  We eat at the bar a lot unless we have more than the two of us.  We had a bad dinner last night at another restaurant and went there for dessert and it more than made up for it.  Thank you Fig Tree for being AMAZING every single time!!!!"}
{"text":"First off let me say our waiter , Ty was a HUGE help with our dinner and wine pairings. We started off with the asparagus wrapped in bruschetta and  and some type of bread. Almost taste like a croissant and was excellent!!! The came the main dishes. My wife had the scallops and I ordered the elk chop. The scallops were very very good but not paired all that well with the lentils. Actually I'm just not a huge fan of lentils. The elk was cooked perfectly and and came with a wonderful horseradish sauce. The cooked red cabbage was a first for me and it was one of the best things about dinner. Fantastic!!! Well we finished off the evening with the Beignets dessert. It was amazing!! Who doesn't love cinnamon and ice cream served on what closely resembles a funnel cake. All this was paired with a grenache wine which was on the cheap end of bottles at this place but was very good. That have a $5000 bottle of Bordeaux there!! In fact if it wasn't for the price I would have gave it 5 stars. I think all in all its a little pricey for what your eating but it was great food with great service so maybe you pay a little more."}
{"text":"Couples' Night! The atmosphere is so quaint and romantic. A rustic house on 7th street, the warmth is felt when you walk in the door. From the initial greeting at the hostess station, you can determine that customer service is impeccable.  Our waiter was Curt. He was wonderful. He explained the delicious menu in great detail. He was patient despite our party of six arriving at different times. He was very helpful in explaining menu items and guiding our choices.   I had sweet potato bisque. Very tasty, it reminded me a tad of baby food! Flavorful and smooth, it was a nice start to the meal. I was looking forward to the grouper with lobster that I had seen on the menu online prior to arriving at the restaurant. I realized it wasn't on there! Curt was awesome and reassured me that it could still be prepared. My plate arrived without the lobster despite ordering it. Curt was responsive and before I took two bites, the lobster tail was placed in front of me. The dish was wonderful. My only minor complaint was that it was a tad under seasoned.   For dessert, the three couples shared two orders of beignets. They were very tasty paired with the cinnamon cream sauce.   Great service. Wonderful atmosphere. Awesome food selections."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating here with some members of the Charlotte Tesla group.  The risotto was amazing!  Great atmosphere and great customer service was experienced by all!"}
{"text":"Oh my, oh my!  The Fig Tree certainly exceeds all the hype!  My new favorite restaurant, hands down!  We usually don't have too much of a notice when it comes to a date night.  When I do check that certain reservation web site, The Fig Tree never seems to have an opening around the time slot we are looking in.  So when we were told that we would have a babysitter for this past Saturday, it was the first restaurant I checked and jackpot!  Thank you Restaurant Week for getting people away from this gem of a restaurant!  We were greeted by a lovely hostess that gave us the option of seating inside or taking the last seat on the verandah.  Luckily it was a beautiful evening and the humidity was low because the verandah was perfect!  We were promptly served with ice cold water and our wonderful server, Ivy.  Since it was our first time, she took her time to go over the menu and gave us her own personal recommendations, which were wonderful!  We started off with two appetizers, the much talked about escargot and the stuffed calamari.  The escargot was light and tender and the sauce it comes in was different and delightful!  Ivy made sure to give us extra bread because she knew we wouldn't be able to resist sopping up the remainder of the sauce!  The stuffed calamari was an awesome surprise, different than the usual fried kind, in a good way!  It was a tube of calamari stuffed with chorizo and atop a tomato purée.  Excellent!  You get a salad along with your main course and you have the option of upgrading it to either a Caesar or spinach salad.  We choose to upgrade to the Caesar and at the recommendation of our server we choose to add fried calamari to it.  Never really thought of that before but it was amazing!  It comes with a LOT of calamari.  Well worth the $3 up charge!  For the main course we ordered the grouper and lobster, and the filet.  If you are looking into this restaurant, I'm sure you've seen the menu online so I don't need to go into detail.  They were both some of the best dishes I've had, and would order them again in a heartbeat!  If I had to choose my favorite, it would be the filet by a slight margin.  It was the most melt in your mouth tender steak I've ever had!  I'm a NY Strip person but I would get this every time!  Dessert...so many choices!!  My husband ordered the coconut panna cotta and I couldn't resist the beignets!  Both amazing!!  I also ordered their French press coffee, and it was the smoothest coffee I've ever drank!  Needless to say, this was the best meal I've had out since I could remember.  Thank you to Ivy and The Fig Tree!  We will be seeing you again!"}
{"text":"Went with colleagues to this place on a Wednesday night.  I thought the menu was creative, an approach I was obliged to encourage by ordering the Elk Chop.  Everyone in our party seemed please with their dishes.  The service was decent, although our server was no help with the wine list and at a place like this I would have expected better wine knowledge."}
{"text":"We went to Fig Tree for our anniversary. They did a wonderful job of making it special and pacing the meal so you can enjoy it thoroughly. We were impressed when our appetizer arrived and we were not quite ready to order our entree... The waitress took our menus out of the way so we could enjoy it and then brought them back when we were through. We sat outside on the porch which I highly recommend. It was a very warm day but cooled off (not a ton of sun) by about 7pm. If you plan to arrive by 6 on a week night it will be empty (we were literally the first people there). It gets busier later which adds to the ambience. The feel is quaint and romantic. Our waitress recommended the scallops which my husband ordered and I wish I had, too. I never order scallops and always worry they won't be filling but there were 7 medium sized scallops and they were delicious. The salad was wonderful, too fantastic dressing) and I highly recommend adding the goat cheese. I was pleased with my trout as well. Their wine list is extensive with bottles ranging from $30-$2000. We thoroughly enjoyed our bottle of Walt Blue Jay Pinot Noir.  I would give it 5 stars if the feel was a little more up to date (it was a little outdated IMO) but overall our experience was very enjoyable and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Located in a old house, divided rooms with an amazing embience allows diners an amazing evening. We chose Fig Tree for a birthday dinner and it did not disappoint. We arrived and were and brought upstairs, to the front room, to a table window side with a view to uptown. An amazing wine room also was in our view, which after reviewing the menu they have a great list of wines by both the bottle and glass to enjoy! We started with foie gras, which melted in our mouth. And, the fried plantain it sat on gave the entire dish an amazing texture and flavor. Each entree is served with a salad, of which you can decide between the house or upgrade to a ceasar. I enjoyed the house salad which had the most amazing dressing and was a perfect size. On to the entrees...we enjoyed the lamb chops and lobster. Both dishes were amazing. Dessert, save room. The chocolate cake was amazing and they adorned the plate with \"Happy Birthday\" in a chocolate glaze.  Fig Tree will be a spot that I will enjoy again, especially for a special event. Food, service and ambience make it one favorite restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte! It has great food, great service and a great wine list. I highly recommend the foie gras appetizer as well as the elk chop if you are looking for something a little more game-y. They had a variety of other items on their menu that looked fantastic as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Fig Tree for our 10th year anniversary the food was superb as well as the service. We especially loved that it has a old house feel with plenty of charm. It 's was highly recommended by friends, and we really enjoyed the  experience ."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place lives up to its reputation no doubt. My boodle took me to Fig Tree for my birthday. Upon walking in and checking in for our reservation, the hostess immediately wished me a happy birthday, I felt really special... and who doesn't love feeling special?!   We were seated immediately in a romantic corner of the restaurant. Their homemade focaccia bread is to die for. I ordered the empanadas for dinner. They were crenberry and mushroom empanadas in a pumpkin cream sauce with brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious. The pumpkin sauce added unique fall flavors to the dish. Our service was phenomenal during our dinner.  Although we didn't order dessert, our server brought us a plate with Happy Birthday written in a delicious chocolate sauce (homemade, probably) with two chocolate truffles.   Overall, everything about Fig Tree is fabulous -- the service, the food, the personal touches. It is pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Great dining experience. I can see this place, with its outdoor patio seating, being a  very romantic dining spot. I however was with 4 other coworkers and had a great dinner.   The octopus and cheese appetizer platters were delicious with a local NC cheese being featured.  They did have an extensive wine selection - we ended up with a Pinot Noir (not my choice) to pair our main courses.   The soup of the day was cauliflower and blue cheese, which was very yummy to the last drop.   I ordered the lamb chops and it ended up being the only reason I gave this place 4 out of 5 stars. It was over cooked!  The wait staff was excellent. Definitely a place to hit in Charlotte.   Make sure to bring a date though ;)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and it may have been the best birthday dinner I've ever had. We brought in a vintage wine and the server knew exactly how to take care of it. The service was excellent throughout the dinner, attentive but not overly so. The food was divine! I enjoyed every bite of everything that was served to me. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So went back to Fig Tree this past weekend, and was inspired to write an update to my last review. We sat upstairs, which had a much better decor/ambiance, and the service was exceptional. The food was great (we had the escargot, lobster/halibut, filet, elk, and Ostrich Carpaccio), and they hit the nail on the head with the various flavors/sauces. We will be returning again for sure."}
{"text":"I have been several times, I love the food.  I have tried the specials, and all of the seafood items.  All are fantastic.  I do have a favorite waitress (sam), she is amazing.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte for a concert and were so happy that we stumbled across the fig tree. We were looking for a nice place to have dinner outside. Their cozy front porch was the perfect spot. The wine list, food and service were all outstanding and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is INCREDIBLE. The ambiance is great. It's actually an old home that's been renovated to a restaurant. Somewhat historical and VERY cool. The service is top notch, and the food is outstanding. If you want perfect service, ask for Ivy. She took care of us upon our first visit and I always request her.  My favorite dish of all would have to be the scallops and of course their beignets for dessert."}
{"text":"The restaurant atmosphere was warm and welcoming. We were greeted promptly and were asked to wait few minutes for our table.   We made our way to the bar and were server great drinks. I got an old fashion with jack and my fiancé ordered Tito's.   The service was exceptional from the start with hostess. Our server was great and very friendly.   Now let's talk about the best part, the food. I ordered the lamb which was buttery and just melted in your mouth. My fiancé veal was fabulous.   The desert was exceptional and to be honest we can't think of anything bad. The prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Located inside Charlotte's Elizabeth neighborhood, an upscale area with limited parking. The historic Lucas House is occupied by the Fig Tree Restaurant, which is named after the 4 brown turkey fig trees on premise. If you enter through the patio, that's the side door. You'll want to go around to the front. The elegant home sets the perfect mood for a date. The ambiance is made with the perfect lighting with a choice of indoor and outdoor seating. This place is very conservative in their dress code. No hats, turn your cell to silent, no open shoes, etc. A great place to take your significant other.   The Chef Greg  Zanitsch, is known for his quality ingredients and his wine pairings. The menu features 8 appetizers ranging from $10 - $20, 4 soups and salads $6- $8, 10 entrees from $25 - $45, desserts, and a wide selection of wines.   I visited on a Tuesday night at 5:30pm and took the last parking spot, in search of Foie Gras. I loved their pan seared Foie Gras (Fatty Duck Liver). It was perfectly plated over a stone ground grit cake with bacon praline and cranberry gastrique. The Escargo was served with cremini mushrooms in a pool of creamy gorgonzola sauce. The sauce was delicious with the tableside bread. You dip. I dip. We dip. yumm. I challenge you not to fill up on the bread and gorgonzola. The special was grilled octopus served with potatoes, and chorizo. It had a yellow curry seasoning, not my kind of thing, but I can tell was well put together.   For dessert, was a layered pastry puff, with basil meringue, and a lime chip. I appreciated the different textures, but it didn't blow my mind. I wish I had gotten the Beignets.   Since this was my after-dinner meal, the tab was only $61. The service started out great, but slowed down toward the end of the dinner.  I can't wait to come back to have some ELK!"}
{"text":"What an excellent meal we had at the Fig Tree. From the food to the drinks to the service. Everything was top notch.   It was date night and our dinner helped it along towards perfect evening status. We started with the seared foie gras which was served atop an almond bread puddingish delight and drizzled with a blueberry gastrique. Just lovely.   She had a scallop app and I had the double cut elk chop in a gorganzola cream for dinner and both were fab.   Service was on point throughout the evening and they arranged for a cab to get us to our next destination. All in all, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We went to the Fig Tree for a romantic date night dinner.  The ambiance was great.  The house is beautifully decorated and I love all the small little rooms.   Everything we ordered was great, however the foie gras was simply the most amazing thing I have ever tasted.  Perfectly cooked, rich, melt in your mouth goodness!  I live in Arizona and I have seriously considered going back to NC just to eat at the Fig Tree."}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in Charlotte. Not just the food though - great ambiance, fantastic staff.   Go here any night you want to be special."}
