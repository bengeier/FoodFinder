{"text":"Was there on a Wednesday night for their cheap wings (45cents) and Bull Dog beer cocktail ($6). Wings were good (we picked honey garlic and hot wings - they were good). Atmosphere and staff were nice."}
{"text":"Tried to get past the low ratings,  try something new, should have known better.  Took 9 mins from when I sat at the virtually empty bar -4 people- to get acknowledged,  not waited on.  Couple mins later, I get waited on...ordered food and beer.  15 mins later, food arrives, empty beer bottle in front of me ignored.   15 mins later, i am asked about food, nothing about another beer.  I don't answer the food question,  just ask for TWO beers, clearly annoyed and tell her \"yes two, based on the time it takes to get one\"!  Bartender walks away - does service bar for another 8 mins. I finally flag down some guy behind the bar to get my beers.  If you're going to try and copy RS Bar, copy the good service too!"}
{"text":"Came here again, big mistake. Place wasn't that busy. We were a table of 3 on a Tuesday. Ordered burgers. The wait was 45min, waitress explained that there were large groups and we had to wait like everyone else. Never again."}
{"text":"So disappointed!  I've been to the NE location and it is Fabulous!  But this was my second time trying this location and it was a huge fail once again.  The first time I got food poisoning, this time...Friday night March 6, the service was embarrassing.  I had to pull tables together myself to fit my party, and felt rushed out the door because we were sitting on the dance floor.  The staff was very rude, although my waitress was very nice it was impossible for her to undo the damage by door staff, bouncers taking our chairs away to open the dance floor.  I suggest the NE location if you want the Shark Club experience:)."}
{"text":"Decent is about the only word that come to mind... not great and not bad.   Our Server was friendly but completely disinterested in us 2 ladies at lunch time in a sea of men.   Food was maybe ok-ish. My meal was greasy and my friend found a portion of the bamboo skewer holding her burger together still in her burger when she bit down on it. Ouch!  You could see the Manager was engaged and he came around to say hello. \"Hi, she bit down on a piece of wood in her burger.\" Nothing was done about it."}
{"text":"The shark club is a great place to grab a bite to eat! We have been here a few times and have always had great food and great service! It's a fab sports bar for a lunch or evening watching hockey on the big screen."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday after watching a musical at Ed Mirvish Theatre, hoping to grab a couple drinks before calling it a night.  It's a \"find your own seat\" kind of deal during that time period, and despite there being a football and hockey game on, my part of two had plenty of picks as to where we would situate ourselves. I should also add that there is no bad seat in the house, there are plenty of big screen tv's everywhere!  They have daily drink specials and a decently priced bar food snack menu. I tried their \"Skinny Richard\" and ended up re-ordering it three times. It'll be a treat if you love XXX Vitamin Water and Blueberry Vodka!  Loved the atmosphere, the eye-candy waitresses, and the menu. Will definitely be back for a meal one of these days."}
{"text":"I've never experienced mismanagement on this level. Our waitress was incredibly nice but they were ridiculously understaffed. The food took a really long time because they only had about four waitresses and running around in heels and mini skirts can't be easy. The food was expensive and not that great, my friends was so bad she couldn't eat it. The waitress went out of her way to get it taken off the bill and offered free dessert. I'd give her five stars if it was based solely on her service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time here. Came for a Thursday night, half price wine and $4.99 Heineken's. The waiting staff and our server were pleasant on the eyes, and had decent service too. Had the double fisted burger and it was your run of the mill burger, not anything extravagant but it hit the spot.  I will be returning. It's nice to have one more option to go to other than the typical Bay St. bar & grills (Earl's, Houston's, The Chase, Moxies, etc.)... although it is a slightly further walk from the financial district."}
{"text":"Inside looks pretty good, and the servers are beautiful. Price is pretty much sports bar average. Great location, downtown Yonge St & Dundas."}
{"text":"the only reason i would ever come here again is because my boss never questions my receipts from here as he had ONE good time when i brought him here (and it had nothing to do with the service or the food).    such a huge corporate mess. upon walking in you're met with a couple of 17 year old hostesses and some security guards (who could be knocked over with a feather) acting like bouncers at a club. Once we showed them ID we were offered the worst seats in the house but we insisted on sitting in the bar area. Once there, we noticed 3-4 \"Bar managers\" who were probably nothing more than kids try to sell us on some ridiculous brand of booze when we already knew what we wanted.   a hollow, corporate shell of a restaurant in a hollow neighborhood (nobody who lives in toronto goes to yonge and dundas voluntarily.) All the staff looked like instagram heroes but knew NOTHING about the service industry."}
{"text":"Not bad if you're just there for beer, the game and waitresses. Two stars if you need to eat - I had the steak sandwich which is a pretty good chunk of meat sitting on a tiny piece of bread, with some onion rings as the top piece of bread. Pretty weird.    Hot tip: if you're sitting at a table, sit on the couch side. The chair is massively uncomfortable and very short, so you're cowering under whoever sits on the couch. Again weird.   Bonus points for urinals which look into Dundas Square."}
{"text":"I wish I could give less then a star but I can't. Let me start with the following, my experience is based solely on quality of food and the worse and rudest service of my life!  Now I know what to expect when I go to The shark club, I'm expecting above average pub grub, cute girls that have the basic understanding of guest service and a good game to watch. Instead I was greeted with the dirtiest bar I ever sat at, ( the bartender had the audacity to throw Menus down on a wet bar but we will get to that individual later), when a guest orders a \"Pint\" of beer and you don't sell beers by the pints your options are as follows: A) inform the guest you don't do pints and explain the options. Well that's really it, what you don't do is pour a half pint and expect them to just be okay with it, many people consider that an insult. We ordered food, bam napkins put straight down on a filthy bar (no side plates as we were obviously sharing). And my favourite was perhaps the worlds rudest, most under qualified and arrogant bartender, some guy with an accent who I will not name and I will let the Karma gods deal with this individual. I might be back , but if i do I will sit in the dining room, as that individual has ruined any chances of me Giving him my money. Arrogant, rude, interruptive, and pretty obviously a Novice at his skill. Food was meh, but I think I was upset by the service so much that it changed the entire dining experience for me.  Avoid that bar like bed bugs."}
{"text":"Terrible service from the waitress. She was hitting on my husband and completely arrogant towards me and very full of herself. Not exactly an enjoyable lunch out. We should have just left and couldn't believe what an idiot she was making of herself. Won't be coming back again. The food was ok."}
{"text":"Went to the shark club for a birthday and to watch the hockey game. Food was mediocre, None of it came out at the same time, and it was still cold and kind of soggy. Service was good, I think they were understaffed. They call it a sports bar, but on the top level, I'd say only about a third of the tables have a good view of a TV. However they do turn up the sound of the game, which is awesome. The thing that really put me off was that they had a jersey \"raffle\" that they were selling tickets for. It turned out that there was just a guy with a table set up, selling 10 tickets for 10$ each to win a jersey. Sounds great except for 2 things: 1, The jerseys were obvious counterfeits. Worth about $45 on eBay. 2, after the raffles were done, the guy working the table was just walking around the bar trying to get people to buy all 10 tickets and he would just give them a jersey. In essence, just selling the jerseys for 100$. First, I don't appreciate some guy approaching me while I'm out with my friends, Trying to hock his cheap wares. This isn't the flea market. Second, the shark club is supposed to be a Decent establishment, they shouldn't be condoning, nay, promoting the sale of counterfeit goods. Maybe they didn't know the jerseys were fakes, but do  a little research. All in all, not a very positive experience. Though I  Will say the highballs (shark size) were pretty potent."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I ate at a nice place. Brand new, still smells like fresh wood.   I got an offer to order anything for free with a bunch of friends; the waitresses were nice and the place actually looks amazing. The entire place has scores going around like a sports arena. The huge tv at the bar is made up of many flat screens. Super flashy and wonderful for a nice time to hang out with friends, or watching the game. I recommend for anyone ! Also, the prices are pretty good- similar to jack astors but they have a lot of specials for the day. I forgot to check dessert because I had to go finish up some work."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great atmosphere... we only had wings so I don't have much to say about the food.   Definitely worth the try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Went in here for the first time today. Very friendly hostess and waitress! Boobs everywhere haha. Very nice view of dundas square. It was a little bit loud but the food was pretty good! Had the nachos, they are huge :D"}
{"text":"Never coming back here. My friend and I decided to come here to watch the hockey game. We sat down, asked them to put it on one of the screens. Our server disappeared for twenty minutes, didn't come back to get our order and didn't put the game up. We asked another server. And another. Finally another server tried but said they didn't get any hockey games.  A sports bar. In Toronto. In Canada. There are six hockey games on and this place doesn't get a single one?  We asked for the bill for our drinks so we could leave. That took another twenty minutes, not exaggerating. We will never come back here."}
{"text":"If your looking for a place to have appies it's a good place but if your going with a group of people and looking for a good meal, this is not the place to go. It took over an hour and a half to get our food. When we finally got our food it was cold and absolutely disgusting. We were greatly surprised when they said that they would cover our meals, there were 16 of us and we all ordered main course meals. It was also our friends birthday and besides the terrible food, the service and atmosphere were amazing. Despite our bad experience the Shark Club is an okay place."}
{"text":"Like being in a generic sports bar filled with only men? Then this is the place for you! Sharkclub's combination of snobby servers and mediocre food is a sure fire way to have your pockets feeling lighter while you constantly question why on earth you didn't go to toad and turtle next door. I give it two stars simply for the fact that they have a large TV."}
{"text":"The volume in this bar is FAR TOO LOUD. The volume was so jacked up during a Leafs game that we couldn't even hear each other at our own table. No joke. Seriously, it must be occupational-hazard level loud for the staff there. Otherwise, the place is fine."}
{"text":"Went to Shark Club to grab a couple drinks last night--terrible service. It was not very busy yet no one seemed to be around to seat us so we grabbed one of the many free booths, all of which were not cleaned. We sat for a while but a server never came by. I saw one of the servers flirting with a group of guys-so I guess she was too busy for any of the other customers. I finally decided to just go to the bar to order drinks, and the wait to be served and get my drinks took about 20 minutes! We just paid for the drinks right away and didn't even bother ordering food. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Food and service were good but overall unimpressed.  Unless you like a room with a 100 tV's all on the same channel that is unless the Super Bowl is on!"}
{"text":"Came in during lunch on a Friday so they place wasn't that busy. They had a great $15 burger and beer special. Good views and plenty of seats and tv's everywhere with every sports game on. Servers were attentive but again it was a slow time of the day."}
{"text":"I stop by here from time to time for lunch.  Best hamburgers I've ever had anywhere.  The French fries I've gotten have always been very fresh.  Sometimes I have the soup of the day and it's always been great.  Service is impeccable, bartenders are awesome.  The manager came by once and asked me how everything was going.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Honestly, one of the worst bars I've been to in Toronto. Didn't have any food so can't judge that but went for a few drinks with friends to watch the NHL playoffs.  Literally took our server about 30 minutes (really, about 30 minutes!) to get us 4 drinks and their \"pints\" are tiny 14 ounce glasses that they charge $7 for?  Only redeeming feature is that our servers was smoking hot! It would be getting one star if it wasn't for that.  Won't be coming back anytime soon. If I do, I'll just get my own drinks at the bar!"}
{"text":"This Pub/ Sports bar is great if all you want is a great night out with friends just to watch sports.  I would definitely watch any hockey game on the giant screen.  Food was ok not the best but what would you expect from a pub"}
{"text":"Despite the hype, this place was a full fledged disaster. We were served immediately, but as soon as we asked for menus we were forgotten. After 15 minutes we had to ask another bartender if we could order food. We ordered the garlic bread appetizer.... Clearly microwaved. Hot hot hot and then hard as rock. We received our meal. Mine was tasting quite good up until I watched the people that had just handled our plates drag the bar floor mats across the ground and then serve other people without washing their hands. That was the end of my meal. My boyfriend ordered buffalo chicken tenders and fries..... No flavour, just hot. Fries were obviously frozen. Terrible. Not impressed at all. :( I would give no stars if I was able."}
{"text":"I had a tuna salad and I was very impressed by the freshness of the greens and the high quality tuna.  I came back for butter chicken and it was seasoned to my liking and very tasty.  Mandy Lemiux served me twice and was very friendly and helpful.  A manager named Terra was also extremely nice in asking about my dining experience.  For the price the food was delicious."}
{"text":"We always stop here for a drink when shopping at the Eaton Centre. I love how the whole place is glass overlooking the whole eaton centre. Great place to catch a game or just chill. I recommend the honey siracha wings!"}
{"text":"When this first opened it was excellent. It has consistently gone down hill. They are pairing back on staff and at times there are no more than 1 or two waitresses trying to cover the whole floor, meaning service is spotty. The food is adequate but expensive (think $15 for fish and chips) and there draft beers are only 14 oz (Vs the traditional 20). There chicken wings were also so so. Skip the food and keep a heads up for the scams. If your going to go, choose a Thursday or Friday when they are more busy."}
{"text":"Awesome time at shark club! Watching the game and having fun with friends. High energy friendly staff and great drinks!!"}
{"text":"Shark Club is a very big modern stimulating sports bar with big screens everywhere you look and stats scrolling across the walls of the restaurant. It has booths and high top chairs for patrons to sit while enjoying their favourite teams up on the screens.   I came on a Wednesday during happy hour. The happy hour runs late by Calgary standards and goes from 3pm to 7 pm Monday to Friday. I enjoyed the drink specials (wine highballs and beer for under $5). They don't have much to offer for happy hour food, but they have daily food specials.   The server was friendly, however we could not easily get her attention when we needed things. That's possibly the downfall of such a big venue.  I definitely recommend Shark club for watching sports as I have not seen anywhere with as many TVs, catering to fans of all sports (even figure skating was on one screen). The drinks are fairly priced and I appreciated the deals. Great spot for a casual hangout with friends."}
{"text":"Positives: More than decent food, huge HD tv in the middle of the bar great for viewing live events! Extremely attractive waitresses (up to the point of employment discrimination really lol), Mens toilet urinals overlook dundas square!  Negatives: extremely overpriced (as is expected from a sports bar downtown Toronto), bad and lethargic customer service; real life e.g. it takes nearly 30 minutes for a server to pass by and give us menus, another 25 minutes to get our drinks and then another 20 for the food (over an hour wait so far), when the industry standard is 12 mins! oh and ofcourse they messed up my order I specifically asked for NO BACON on my cheeseburger (but meh lower tip for the server). Also they overcharged us more than once on separate occasions! I didnt order three beers, I only ordered one thank you very much.. Oh lets not forget another 20 mins to get the bill!  Three star rating. Only go there for reliable big screen HD tv sporting events and some eye candy from the waitresses ;) as for Food? only If youre willing to wait and overpay!"}
{"text":"Pretty typical for a franchise bar.  I don't like coming here alone and I'm typically just dragged in here by my friends. The place is always too loud and too busy. The food and drinks aren't really that appetizing either alongside some pretty steep prices."}
{"text":"The service we received was sad. The place was totally understaffed. You might as well cut 6 more people and shut the place down. Let some else move in, motivated to give better service and value. My steak sandwich was at most 6 ounces and under 2 onion rings( seriously cut the onion rings ). The drinks were slow and the waitress was around every 15 to 20 minute, she was busy serving other table so I blame management, My steak was 19.00 and totally not worth it. I would go to McDonalds just up the street then having to go here again."}
{"text":"At best this is crappy service, sitting here for 15 min waiting for service as 7 servers are talking at the bar.  UNREAL."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, my server was great, our food came out super quick and it was all around a good visit. The second time was the complete opposite. I went here for a friends birthday dinner on a Sunday night a few weeks back and it was dead. Obviously,  you'd expect your service to be extra great. I was wrong! We were one if about six tables in the entire place. Our waitress seemed like she was on another planet. She barely came to our table our entire visit. My friend ordered paralyzers without ice and it took tgree drinks and a trip to the actual bartender to get that sorted. Our food took an hour to come out after we ordered and we were all starving. On that note though, the food was awesome!!! If it weren't for my first visit,  I'd give it a 2/5,but I suspect it was just a fluke night. Hopefully my next visit will be better! Sadly though, because of that visit, I'm not inclined to make a visit any time soon."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while on a work trip to Calgary on a Sunday night. I had the steak sandwich with sweet potato fries. Really good, steak was cooked exactly how I wanted. My only complaint was that the service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Other then the Real Sports Bar, the Shark Club is the only other bar with lots of screens and TV's to watch your games on. They have side scoreboards making the atmosphere like an actual stadium/arena.   Being located at the corner of Dundas and Yonge, or in otherwords the Canadian Time Square, you get a 4 floor high rise filled with stores, restaurants, bars and a theatre. With the Shark Club located on the 3rd floor, you get a great view from the windows of the busy intersection of Dundas and Yonge and Eaton Centre.   The bar is dark, loud and filled with TV's to watch any game you want. The seating is spacious and can hold a lot of customers.  The massive bar in the middle of the restaurant along with massive TV behind it, gives you a big vibrant feel and somehow makes me want to drink more. It's all an illusion.   The food is fair and nothing special. Like any other bar. They have daily specials for food and drinks and the deals are not too bad. Check out the menu - http://www.sharkclubs.com/menu  With Jack Astors and Milestones in the same building and many other bars surrounding it, I would go to Shark Club first."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit to Shark Club and finally there is something worthwhile to write about, unlike the first 2 visits.  Tip #1: After 7pm it is 19+ only please remember to bring your ID, they check everyone!! You might think that, who wouldn't have his/her ID on? Well, you will be surprised, sometimes you just don't, maybe cos you know somebody is going to buy you a dinner and you for sure look 19+? And that happened to me today (had to run back home to grab the ID but I live close so, its alright)  Tip #2: There is a drink/food special every day, and Wednesday is $0.45/wing, which is like $4.50 per pound of wings. Wings are skinny and small but they are not bad. Sufficient flavours to choose from. Salt and pepper is a good one if you like dry wings!  What deserved my review today was their service. I am not crazy about their wings but for that price, I don't have unrealistic expectations either. You get what you pay for and you just gotta be fair about it. I think I get what I deserve paying $4.50 for a pound of wings.  The waitress I had, her name was Camila, she was awesome! She checked up on us at least 4 times, in a good way. She recommended desserts to us, she also introduced their weekend special (UFC + hockey + drinks specials). I asked if she was working coming weekend, she was not even gonna be there. Sometimes, that genuine service just saved it all even when the food was so-so (However, I do not think good service can save bad quality of food)  Finally, the manager who has some English accents, another reason for me to give 4 stars. Loved his energy, he was keeping us informed where we were at in the lineup, he was friendly. Together with the server, they saved our night at a so-so bar.  I hope my review can encourage more people to come try this bar even tho they do not have the best ratings. I hope in time, with a larger sample size, it will give the bar the right direction to improve and to grow."}
{"text":"I was surprised how small this place was. It's no bigger than a pub with TV's everywhere. For a place to watch the game it seems good. The operative word there being \"seems.\" You see, I didn't really get to experience it.   We waited almost 10 min to get a drink at the bar and we were standing RIGHT BESIDE THE CASH. When I bartended I was told to keep my head on a swivel. Something the staff here might want to get better at. Finally after not even so much as eye contact from a bartender we left without ordering and went to another bar.   Verdict: There are other, better options in the area."}
{"text":"I  liked it here. Service is excellent and so friendly. Food is okay. Big screen TV and nice music."}
{"text":"We were a group of 16, it was both mine and another's birthday, and it was a Saturday. We left very pleased.  It's a sports bar, so the atmosphere definitely matches the type of place this is. Lots of TV's, lots of different sports games on.  For a sports bar, the food was decent.  What was really amazing though was how our waitress (A.) handled the entire situation. From the get-go she was prepared for the big group of people, and for the duration of the entire evening she handled everything like a pro.  She checked back on us very often, and as the group trickled in (we all came in at separate times), she didn't let anybody sit for longer than a minute before asking if she can get them something. Drinks and food orders were taken and delivered with a good pace.  To top it off she asked whether the bill will be together or separate, and was absolutely fine with splitting the bill for 16 people, which I find to be rare in Toronto.  Overall she provided some of the best service I've gotten in this city, even compared to a few upscale restaurants I've been to. Kudos!"}
{"text":"If you're here for drinks, to watch the game or to check out girls then sure go ahead and come here. But if you're here for the food, then I recommend dining somewhere else. The food was decent, mediocre at best. The service was good though.  I ended up getting the Golden Shark chicken wings and they were pretty good. Not the best though; I've had better. I think this place is best suited for happy hour."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place... I really really did. The food was mediocre and that would have been okay... However the service was horrid. I get the difference between casual cafe dining and upper class dining. I am there for some sort of a dining experience, not for you to talk to me like I'm ruining your hangover by making you work. I will leave it at that one simple example. I suggest Jack Astros on the 3rd level if you are looking for quality food, drinks and a game. If you absolutely have to be there I suggest you sit at the bar.. A couple of those guys looked like they know what they are doing. Waste of $100 I tell ya"}
{"text":"I've been here just the one time, but I'll definitely be back. It's really nice inside here and although I only had a salad the other food that was being ordered around me looked really good too. They have a good selection of beer on tap as well. The salad I had was fresh and tasty.  You know how some times you order a salad and get those wilting pieces ? I didn't get those in mine.   I would recommend anyone coming here to get a seat on the second floor.  You get a good view of all the televisions, and others things.  The other things meaning the eye candy.  I'm looking forward to my next visit here."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the NBA all star game. For some reason all the tables were 'reserved' although later it seemed they just let random people sit at them. Sat at the bar, where the service was ok. That being said, the bartenders seemed a bit disorganized and seemed to favor some patrons over others. Also, one bartender used his fingers to pull the spicy green beans for Caesars out of the jar - I think that's a job for tongs.  Had the hot wings - which were ok. They came with carrot sticks which were very dried out. My friend's food came a good 10 minutes after mine. Would have been nice to eat together. All in all a mediocre experience. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here because my local rep raved about the scenery. This is a massive sausage fest with great TV's. If you like drinking, looking a big boobs and lots of skin, this is your spot. The food, however, is average, at best. It's better food than Hooters, but falls well below Moxies/Cactus Club. If you come expecting that - you'll love the place. The service is good and there's plenty to look at."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night for their 39 cent wing night. Wings were too undercooked and some of them were bloody!! Maybe its because they rush it when it comes yo making wings! But seriously wings need to be cooked the right way. This was my second time here and service seemed a bit better than the first because it was faster. Drink specials were pretty decent. I'm giving this place a 2 star because it doesn't stand out of the ordinary and is OK for a sports bar. My suggestion if you want to eat wings is to order them well done."}
{"text":"Been coming here for awhile and although yes they lack a patio it is still one of the best places to watch sports.  The manager (aussie dude) has been super helpful on many occasions. The staff are really on par with anywhere else around here.  Being a football fan I have always been able to come here on an afternoon and ask for the game to be shown on TV and they have always been able to assist, as long as the game is showing that is.   More recently I called to reserve an area for a large group to watch the European Cup Final and again it was hassle free, had a great section and our waitress Kimberly was super attentive.  I like the beer selection here, especially since they have the elusive Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc on tap.   The food is nothing that will blow your mind but people generally don't come here for that. It is after all a sports bar and they do that very well.   Just a note, super nice washrooms with a great view of the Y&D square."}
{"text":"I actually like Shark Club for sports. There is TV's all around, a fun atmosphere and the servers are usually good. Plus, I like when servers are pretty AND nice, it compliments my beer!   The food is pretty good too, never really had a bad meal and I have tried quite a few items."}
{"text":"I came here recently, it was a Wednesday. Arrived at 6 just in time to enjoy one hour of Happy Hour. Ordered a glass of wine, then made sure to order two more at Happy Hour pricing. They have 39 cent wings on Wednesday so I took advantage of that as well and was not disappointed. I liked this place so much I came back the following Saturday so needless to say I am making it one of my go to places."}
{"text":"This bar is only a month old, so I can only assume that the other negative reviews are because the place was still ironing out some of the bugs.   I was there last night for the Leafs game and the boxing match, and had a great time. Prompt, friendly service sitting up at the bar, and amazing looking wait staff."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar, so adjust your expectations accordingly. That being said, the food is actually quite good. The WiFi is fast and free and there are more TVs than Elvis's house.  Thursday's special is about 33% off on their spaghetti and meatball dinner--being a relative cheapskate I jumped on the offer and was glad that I did. The highlight of the meal was the garlic bread--it's so garlicky!!! And get it with cheese because, well, cheese. #duh The meatballs and noodles were also very tasty, and had a bit of a kick to them, so be wary if you're a spice lightweight like myself. It is also served with a helping of ricotta, you decide if you want to mix that in or not.  Service was very friendly but a bit slow, so don't come here if you're in a hurry. We had been walking for quite some time so relaxing in the lounge area with the plush benches was just what we needed."}
{"text":"This review was long overdue. My one and only encounter with this pretentious for no reason establishment was one for the books. I had ventured out with a friend to try this place out. Not trying to be overly impressed because, at the end of the day, its bar food. Now the server, I'd rather not name names, was ingeniune with her \"girlfriend\" approach by continuously sitting down beside us to help pick out a meal. I sense fakeness from a mile but i can't knock a girl's hustle :). As present as the server seemed when she would show up, she never checked on us and it took 45 min to get the bill. So my friend and i played along, being courteous, respectul and patient. We never gave any inkling that we wouldn't tip (my motto is \"do not go out to eat if youre unable to tip your server and BOH\").  When the bill, came my friend and i had noted that there had been an automated gratuity added to A TABLE FOR TWO!!! (not a \"race baiter\" but come onnn and the server was also black...tf?) Livid af, we wrote a detailed message to management to rectify the situation. A $50 gift card was granted however the change in management and the format of the feedback form made it virtually impossible to track the original complaint. Needless to say, they missed their chance to wow us and we won't be returning :)"}
{"text":"Sweet sports bar with killer view of yonge dundas square. Service is really nice...and food menu specials are awesome $$. Go for the game or for specials. Burger night is the best, Thursday I think. Wings are kind of small, but decent."}
{"text":"No idea why this place has such a low rating, it's awesome. It's like happy hour all day everyday here. There are different daily deals on food and drinks. My favourite being the 45 cent wings (golden shark and Korean BBQ sauces are the best) on Wednesdays and 1/2 price wine on Thursdays (that means $21.50 bottle of J. Lohr!!).  Also like to take advantage of the 1/2 price sliders (think mini big macs) and parmesan tater tots (mix the spicy ketchup and truffle aioli together - taste buds blown) available Monday to Friday 3PM - 7PM and Sunday to Thursday 10PM - close.    Great place to watch sports - next best atmosphere in the city. The best being Real Sports, but the food and service here is better. I like to sit at the bar since its the closest to the big screen, the bartenders are real nice, and there have been multiple occasions when they give free drinks.  Giving it a 5 star just to up the rating... this place should be at a 3.5 or 4 at least."}
{"text":"I was really surprised with this place. For a sports bar, the menu is interesting and the layout is nice and open. I came here with a colleague for a lunch meeting and requested a table where I could spread out with my laptop, iPad, etc. Took a booth upstairs and was happy that it wasn't as noisy as I thought it might be. Free wi-fi was definitely a bonus as we had some work to get done. There was even an outlet at our table (which would have been awesome had I remembered my power cord...).  Our server, Sarah, was awesome. She was attentive and kept the hot water and honey coming for me (bad cold that day!). I'm happy to report that even the appetizers come in really good portions, so no one will go hungry even if you only order a couple of items to pick at. The food was better than your average sports bar, that was a plus. With Ahi Tuna tacos and Four Cheese Poutine on the menu, it isn't your average bar menu.  Shark Club - if I have to choose between you and Moxie's next door, you will win each and every time!"}
{"text":"After we wrote our last review, an employee from shark club contacted us wanting to know more about our experience. It was very refreshing to have someone care about our time. The employee was very apologetic and actually sent us a gift card in the mail to allow us to have a better experience next time. Having someone show they care like this feels great, we will absolutely go back and give this place a second chance! Thanks so much."}
{"text":"We went to watch the jays game a few weeks ago and actually had a good experience. There were plenty of large screens to look at from any point in the restaurant which is was very nice. The service was good, short wait times for the food. We ordered a pizza because it was the daily special which was great, not the biggest portion but enough for two people. Overall a good experience, we had a negative experience at the other location and received a gift card. Was very much worth it and will come back."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of months ago. I liked the place because there was so much to look at! They had a TV monitor EVERYWHERE! And I liked their food. I thought it was kinda pricey to pay almost $20 for a burger after tax and tip (i don't remember the exact price..) but i thought it was delicious. I ordered their garden salad burger and my friend ordered the shark burger. According to her \"The best burger she has ever had!\". The burger i ordered was a vegetarian burger but it was sooo good that I didn't notice that there was no meat in it! On the side, they gave us a salad. The salad portion was HUGE. They literally shoved salad into the little salad bowl because when I scooped it out onto my plate, there was a plate of salad. They used the pricier garden salad mix for the salad; instead of the generic romaine lettuce and tomatoes.   Also, the waitresses were really friendly and they had a short conversation with us and overall, a nice experience!  You should definitely give this place a try! Great food, service and a nice bar ambiance!"}
{"text":"It's your typical sports bar - I'd only go here if I want to watch the Raptors play. It gets packed and pretty loud, they've got a DJ playing music during half-time/time outs. Why only three stars? Man, this place really knows how to rub salt in the wound when the Raptors lose. Literally. Every food item here is SO incredibly salty, almost as if they're forcing you to buy drinks to quench the thirst as well as the sorrows when the Raptors lose."}
{"text":"This is a good sports bar, but don't expect much else. 4 stars as a sports bar, 2 stars as an eatery. Overall 3.5 stars.   Came by to watch some football (wait, did I just say that? That's weird.) Ok, let's be honest. My friends were coming here to watch some football and ogle waitresses, and I came along for the deep fried food. They are ok with that, and I'm ok with that. It was pretty busy on a Sunday night, but there was a big game on (so I am told. I was also told I was cheering for Seattle.) This was a pretty loud venue, so not great for catching up, or going on a date, but I would totally come here to watch Olympic hockey, where a roaring crowd is appreciated. (Mostly, I just wished we were watching hockey.)  We orders 3 plates of wings, fries and nachos for the table, plus assorted drinks. Sunday has a ceasar special.  Upside:  The wings were decent. ($10.99 for a lb) The waitress (and her large breasts) was attentive. The waitress split our bill for us. They ran out of nachos (one of the reasons we went), but a manager came out, apologized, and offered us another appetizer on the house. Very good customer service.  Downside:  They ran out of nachos! We were charged for two orders of fries even though we only received one."}
{"text":"we came here on Saturday night. Unique quality about Toronto is that the pubs and eateries start flooding by 5pm especially over weekends. So even if it was 6pm there was a long waiting here. Tip for you, go soon on weekends before your stomach starts growling too loud! There are 2-3 other sports bar in the same building and all were equally full. The prices and the menu did fascinate us which is why we chose this place.  We tried chexican chicken for a starter which was an Indian twist of chili chicken and mexican. I wouldn't say it was bad or disappointing but was good but not great. The vinegar flavor saved the dish as the tangy taste was stimulating the buds.  For main course we chose the Indian variety of butter chicken with rice and veggies. It was definitely not Indian butter chicken but was edible as it matched with Thai red curry. So, it was like we expected something which turned out something else but since the taste was good, I would still rate it as 4. The music is okay not too noisy. There is live sports going on. If you go out with friends should be a good hang out. The service is also good."}
{"text":"This bar was pretty underwhelming. I was expecting something much bigger like the Jack Astors or Milestones upstairs in the same building. We had to sit on one of those benches that have the little tables along the side, which is awkward. Also, unlike the restaurants upstairs, there is no patio.  It's a sports bar, so lots of TVs and they give out prizes, etc., based on what's happening in the game. The beer list was ok; really, it was just what you would expect at this kind of place these days though.  I just had the chicken tenders since I wasn't starving and they were merely ok. I had the poutine as a side and it was below average. I should really learn to stop ordering poutine in chains like this! The cheese is never great, which ruins it.  The service was adequate.  All in all, I think there are better options nearby if you are looking to grab a bite and catch a game. I generally like these Western chains that have been migrating east, but this one is a bit of a miss."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I got together after a while of not seeing each other and I suggested to come here to take advantage of their 49 cents wing night. I've been here a couple times in the past and thought the travel was worth the deal which was why I opted for this place.  Unfortunately, I was quite taken aback when our server failed to be culturally sensitive when speaking to us. In a city where we are all so culturally diverse, I would like to think that employees are more aware of their surroundings.  Food was obviously worth the visit for what it's priced at, the general vibes were great, but other than that, my night was pretty much dampened by that."}
{"text":"Yeeeelp it's a 5 star for the service with your standard 3 star pub/beer food. Biggest tv i've seen in a lounge."}
{"text":"We were looking to burn some time before seeing a movie and noticed a board advertising happy hour.  We went up to the hostess and asked her what the happy hour specials were. The tight black dress must have cut off circulation to her brain because she giggled and said \"I don't know.\" She then opened the menu and showed up the daily specials. Needless to say we declined to go in."}
{"text":"Service was okay - we told our server we were in a rush and she accommodated us.  They had steamwhistle on special when we went but they were out of stock and were not offering anything to supplement. Based on the reviews I read here, this is a common occurrence.   Food was really, really poor. Fries were the only okay part - I had the chicken and brie sandwich and it just didn't taste very good, it was assembled poorly and the bread was crumbly. My friend had the steak sandwich which should definitely not be called a sandwich - a whole piece of sirloin, unsliced, cooked less than the medium rare he ordered so it was chewy, served on a piece of toasted bread with 2 onion rings on top. It was impossible to eat and not very good from what he said. This place is trying to be a mini-Real Sports and failing.   And a personal pet peeve - places that don't show their prices on the website.   Will not return."}
{"text":"So if youre looking for cute women... This is your spot. If you're looking for good food.... Keep looking.  I ordered the Steak and Prawns for $27.99- kind of expensive but I wanted to treat myself- as did my buddy. So heres why I have 1 star.  I asked to replace the potatoes with more vegetables- my buddy got 5 small potatoes and veggies while I got maybe 3 extra pieces of carrots- lame.  I also paid $1 to get mushrooms- so this included literally half of a button mushroom cut into 7 peices....  Now onto the \"prawn\". These so-called Prawns are actually cocktail shrimp- and small ones for that matter. And I was only given 3.... Three small shrimps. What the hell?!?   So obviously this bar- thats what it is and not a restaurant- isnt meant for delish meals but for beer, sports and boobs."}
{"text":"Not a very good food place. My friend and I decided to give this a try since we've both never been. The food selection was pretty bad... Ended up getting a poutine which was pretty disappointing in taste. And our waitress was never around for us to ask for anything... Also, the music seemed to be really loud where we were sitting I had to shout for my friend to hear me across the table... I felt like it was a club.   Overall not a good experience overall"}
{"text":"The resturant itself is quite nice, a total sports bar with a GIANT tv in it. The booths seats were comfortable however our tables was wicked sticky and the foot rest underneathe the table was wobbly. Every glass that was brought to the table for pop and water was kind of filmy not dirty but this weird film on it. The waitress was really friendly and attentive however as a female customer I don't appreciate her boobs in my face. They were pouring out of her shirt. You can be sexy and classy and that was not it. The food was okay, it was kind of cold when we got it but still tasty. We had nachos, chicken fingers with sweet potatoe fries and antojitos. The waitress however didn't know what aioli was when I asked for it and I had to explain it to her (FYI: they have it).  The other waitresses that came by to help drop off food and bus the table were friendly, efficient  and adequately dressed.  I found the food a bit expensive and I don't think I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was ok. Try the sliders cause they were the best thing that I had when I was there. Not a bad place to watch a game. I was sick of real sports so this was a good alternative. I would go back."}
{"text":"I feel like Shark Club has gone through a number of phases since opening.  Initially there seemed to be endless marketing money and a real push to get established.  Then as the location matured they have been working to find their niche in the already overcrowded segment of restaurants.  The food has been pretty consistently good but not gourmet.  Jambalaya is solid, but not a signature dish.  Had the Burger & Pint for $15 today..  as a friend pointed out a Big Mac meal will run you $10 and this burger was awesome compared to one of those AND had a pint!  So will be around again soon, just wish there was a bit more in the way of options."}
{"text":"The view from this restaurant that overlooks Dundas square is amazing. Also loved the ambiance, comfy sofas tucked in a corner for you to have a private time with the people you came with, and the food. Definitely? give their ciders a try especially in the summer!"}
{"text":"Tried a few bars for UFC, made it here and found was treated well by staff. Food was average bar fare, but Courtney's service was excellent. Great night out."}
{"text":"The food was really good , and quick to arrive. I would recommend the smokey parm   Service from our waitress was awful but made up for by the manger who was very nice and clearly working his but off to make up for the waitress."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim for the first time and will not be returning. I was not impressed by the food at all. Ordered the vegetarian quesadilla, very bland and the dish came with two small dipping sauces which were not enough for the whole dish.. My friends weren't too impressed with their food either. The atmosphere is nice and modern though. Service isn't too bad. But, I'm certain I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Haven't given an one star in a while, but congrats Shark Club for winning the jackpot!  We came here to catch one of the NBA playoff games since this place is located conveniently by Eatons. That basically sums up all the positives.  We got the wing's special, which was 39 cent wings or something. The dry rub wings tasted like the sahara desert, if sand could taste that bad. The saucier wings were slightly better, but they were either too salty or had a flavour that made your tongue feel uncomfortable after eating it. Kind of like a numbing (not spicy) feeling.  Despite having a good waiter to table ratio, it still took our waiter approximately 30 minutes to grab our bills.   This is a convenient place, but unless you got a whole day to spend on waiting for bills and eating subpar wings, I'd recommend somewhere else."}
{"text":"Don't really know why people rate this location so poorly. Staff was friendly, service was fast. Came in at lunch. No reservations. We were sat in 2 minutes. Food at the table inside 20.   Food was super fresh. Had the Med wrap with a green salad. It was great!  Can't complain about the view either!   I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yes. This is a chain.  But they have 39 cent wings on Wednesday and they are by far the cheapest wings in Toronto.  So this is where I go. On Wednesdays.   Bye."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday afternoon when the place wasn't extremely busy. The bartenders were very friendly, especially the male, who shook our hand and introduced himself when we sat down. They had a few good drink deals going on including half price glasses of wine (my fave!) that were worth going back for. I know it's a sports bar so maybe this is a petty complaint, but I don't know that soccer is something that needs to be played over the speaker system. The music that followed the game was played on a volume that was reasonable and appropriate to the atmosphere. I appreciate that the manager came over to check on us at some point as well. My biggest beef is that they seem to make their female servers and bartenders wear heels - not safe and ridiculous. Do better for society *end rant*. Other than that, a fine place to go for a drink."}
{"text":"For a sports bar, the food here was surprisingly much better than I had thought! I ordered the Shark burger with a house salad and my boyfriend ordered the steak sandwich with double fries as his side.   My burger was as delicious as it was beautifully presented. The patty was hefty, juicy meat and as the menu suggests, fully loaded with bacon, melted cheddar, sauteed onions, and mushrooms. The house salad was pretty interesting too, with this carrot/fruit slaw on top but I didn't like that the dressing was too vinegary. I choked a few times inhaling that.   The steak sandwich looked small when it arrived but it was a pretty thick cut and the steak was nonetheless tender and juicy. Both mains were yum! The fries, however, were a bit lacking. Not bad but not great either - just your average potato-filler that you eat until you feel a little gross and then you leave the rest behind.  Presumably because it wasn't a busy night when we came, our waitress was extremely nice and checked up on us a few times to see how we were doing throughout the meal."}
{"text":"I come here for the $0.49 wing Wednesday's. The wings are okay but they are defiantly cheap! They are good enough to stop your random craving of wings.   If you combine it with their happy hour (4 pm to 6pm) you can get a highball ( bar rail ) drink for $4 each.  I've had their other food and it's just mediocre. I strictly come here for their wing special only."}
{"text":"Downtown TO for a movie and some shopping.  Decided to stop at this place for a drink and to rest our tired feet.  Nice open bar which I expected to be busier than it was.  Prices are a bit steep but you are paying for the location after all.  Parmesan tater tots for $11 tells you something.  Ordered old fashioned and a pineapple ginger margarita to start and edamame and quinoa kale salad.  The salad was delicious.  The drinks were good.  I asked for less than the standard portion of tequila and the server was nice enough to bring over a shot glass of it for us to do as we please.  Nice place for a bite to eat.  Not sure why there are complaints about noise and service in other reviews.  No complaints here!!"}
{"text":"Came here after a birthday dinner for one of our friends. There are A LOT of TV's here which is a plus especially during game night.   I'm not sure if I can give this place 2 stars since all we had were drinks. But the drink specials for the night were mediocre at best. It was a Saturday night and they had 2oz of ciroc vodka for about 6.99 I believe. But my friends said it tasted water downed. The flavours weren't the best either.I would have preferred to go JOEYS Thursday night drink special for that. Service was also mediocre. Kind of slow kind of okay at times. The washrooms were kind of gross. Tissue everywhere but I guess that is normal."}
{"text":"Visited on Fri Nov 14, 2014 at 5:30pm party of 3. We were promptly walked to a table, the place was about half full. Our server Amanda was attentive and courteous, all the servers look pretty and friendly. I got a new menu item chicken and waffles, and wow it tasted good! The waffles was soft and fresh, wings were like chicken strips a bit salty for my taste though. Only one cider available Somersby. A manager even stopped by to make sure everything was ok.   The place is a bit loud in terms of volume to have a conversation. Fri is ladies night after 9pm ladies get free champagne.    When the Leafs game started at 7pm, they play a scoring game. Each table can randomly pick a puck from a bucket with a number on it. If that player scores a goal your table gets a free shot. We didn't get to stay for the game, but if we were it would have definitely added to a fun atmosphere. Too bad the Leafs don't score very much haha.  The service and food is great at this place.  Things have changed since previous reviews."}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on at this place. Showed up around 9pm to watch the hockey game, and they had ridiculously loud club music playing. I don't really understand why. Prices are too high, particularly for wings. Beer selection isn't great. Service was genuinely not bad at all, but the ridiculous confusion of this bar's identity means you should probably not watch the game here."}
{"text":"My colleague and I live and work in San Diego and were in Toronto on business on April 9th, 2015. I wanted to watch a hockey game, specifically the Blues and the Blackhawks - huge Blues fan!  The concierge at the Eaton Chelsea Hotel mentioned a few places but we decided to try the Shark Club, and I am glad we did.  We walked in and it was jammed, which is always a good sign, but there were very few tables in which to get a good vantage point to enjoy the game, but we talked with the bar manager, Dragan, and he took the time to set us up at a nice table and put the Blues on two TV's for us. Which didn't bother any other patrons as there were plenty of TV's for everyone.  We started with some beers, some food and some shots while we enjoyed the game. He kept checking in on us which was cool, and he did that with a lot of customers, making sure everyone was taken care of.  The food was great, the servers were (very hot) awesome at taking care of their guests, but Dragan was the rock star that night. Without him setting us up and taking care of us, the evening would not have been so enjoyable.  We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Jumbalaya - chicken, prawns, chorizo sausage, onions,and Creole rice. (Score: 5/5) One word - Delicious! They do not skimp on the chicken, prawns (shrimp really) and chorizo.... Very hearty and fullsome meal. It ain't just all rice. Spicy and flavourful.  Our waitress was really nice too"}
{"text":"17 foot tv screen, little TV's everywhere, cleavage ditto  Food so so, had Thai green curry rice, huge veggie chunks meant a knife and fork required   Very salty, not spicy curry a bit of a disappointment, Service was great."}
{"text":"To start, I really like the location of this place, right in the down town core, and elevated above ground level so you actually have a nice looking view of outside. The interior is bigger than I thought, with plenty of TV's and seating varieties to suit all sizes of groups of customers.  I came on a Wednesday to indulge in their 45 cent wing special, still can't believe how cheap that price is! Only catch with the deal though is that you have to purchase a drink with your order (doesn't have to be alcoholic),  please just steer clear of the iced tea, it was pretty horrible not gonna lie! Also, the dealnis only available from 3pm onwards, so not too good for a lunch idea. My boyfriend and I started our meal off their half priced sliders, tasted like mini big mac's, so if you like those, then you'll like these! With the discount, it only came out to $2 per slider, not too bad. Now for the wings, we had an order of the goldn shark (which were wet and similar to that of a buffalo flavour), and garlic parm (a dry rub). The wings are a little on the small size, and quality was just ok in my opinion. However,  considering tge cheap Wednesday price of only 45 cents per wing, this is sooo worth it! Having to pay full price (whatever that price is), I dont think i could justify that!"}
{"text":"What an improvement from prior experience. I frequent Shark Club often because it is located near my work. Every time I dine here, the food was disappointingly average. However, today was game-changing. Our server kept recommending their Double-Fisted Burger ($12.99). I thought about it, chuckled...   And said \"sure\".  The burger was beyond bar/pub burgers and the meat was perfectly moist. Large strips of bacon, lettuce tomato, and melted cheddar were included. Amusingly, the patty was two fist worth of beef.  There are always promotions at Sharks' so drinks kept flowing. Domestic pints ($5.50) are all day promotions. Not a bad place for cheap drinks.  Sadly, our server decided to play a game of hide and seek towards the end of the night without notice. Don't expect speedy service after your food arrives.   No sharks are served at this establishment."}
{"text":"Came after work for happy hour. While the deal was good ($4 for bar rail drinks, house wine, and selected apps) the drinks were watered down and the food was only ok. Tator tots were good, but the sliders were horrible. The bun and patty were so dry! Not many people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for Wednesday wing night.  49 cents!!! That in itself made me want to rate this place a 5*.  Great location, great price, big screens to watch the game.  They even silence the music and play the sound to the game.  However, my enthusiasm to love this place waned after actually tasting the food and drinks.  The drinks seemed water down.  The wings looked great, but some of the sauces are not even palatable.  Tried four different sauces and only one, the medium, was digestible.  The very first one I tried, the smokey parmesan sounded so promising and even mild.  Well, it wasn't and it was super salty and was not edible.  I tried to scrape the salty outer layer, but even then I had to send it back.  The second one I tried was the korean bbq.  It looked good, but tasted like nothing.  My companion also commented on the lack of taste.  We also tried the sirracha honey.  There was no honey flavour.  It was all sirracha.  Had to order blue cheese to calm the heat, but even that didn't work.  I usually love hot sauce with blue cheese, but this was so extra.  So the only palatable wing sauce here was the medium.  The size of the wings vary greatly as you can see in my pics.  The dry rub is crispy.  The food came out quick, so I think they were pre-cooked and just tossed in varying degrees digestible to non-digestible sauces.  The waitresses are very efficient and friendly.  The hostess sat us down quickly.  This place would be good, if they just delivered on the food.  Maybe because it was wing night, they didn't really pay attention to the flavour, but I really think the wings are a solid 2 * while the service was a 4.5*, nothing exceptional so I can't say it's perfect.    The actual place once inside is about average to below average.  The menu were sticky and oily.  The tables were not cleared up immediately.  The washroom are in varying states of disrepair.  The faucet was not working, had to move to another to wash the soap, then that sink and faucet was wobbly.  Tissue on the floor.  Note it's 19+ only.  Not sure what time this starts, but saw it on the door."}
{"text":"We went here because of the reviews and weren't disappointed. Great food. The staff were all friendly and attentive. I was really impressed until I found out that the restaurant was associated with Moxies. Too bad. Unlikely that we'll go back.   Yah, I know, it's not rational but...I'm only a customer  who's disdain for Moxies is just that strong."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service, great for watching sports!! As they have this Huge hd screen in the middle"}
{"text":"I go to university just around the corner from this location, so I have been here a few times. Beginning with the good things about this place...it's an amazing location - you don't have to walk outside from the subway, there's lots of parking garages nearby, and it's right across from the eaton centre. Also, I have been able to book the semi-private lounge for quite a few events for free. Theres a few couches and can comfortably seat 30+ people. Just make sure to book in advance! On Wednesdays, they have a promo for $0.59 wings with the purchase of a drink.  Now onto the poorer elements of this restaurant. The food is mediocre and overpriced. I ordered 3 pounds of wings and 2 cans of pop on a Wednesday and it came up to $25, and I know other places with better wings for cheaper. The wings were quite boney and the sauce was very sour (not my preference). Pitchers are very expensive - avoid at all costs! There's definitely a Hooters-vibe to this place - waitresses dress skimpy and service is average at best.  I would recommend the place to anyone who wants to watch the sports game or host a large event. You must be 19 or older to enter - my party and I have been individually ID'd! One time I forgot my ID, so the waitress talked to the manager who said I can stay but nobody in my party can order anything alcoholic (good thing there was only 2 of us and we weren't planning on drinking anyways)."}
{"text":"Decent bar at a good location. Tons of flat screen TVs with all sorts of sports on. The food however is medicore and I wouldn't recommend you go here unless watching sports is your thing."}
{"text":"Was just there waiting from 1030pm sitting at a booth that was not cleaned waiting for a menu. The waitress said they will be a minute; half an hour later no one approached us or gave us a menu. Poor service for a restaurant that should be used to a busy environment."}
{"text":"This rating is in no way indicative of my waitress whom I thought exhibited great service skills. She made sure that we got close to what we wanted and was very polite the entire time.  Thought this was a very trendy bar when I first walked in, decked out with huge flat screen tvs all over. Through the windows were the big screen displays of Eaton Square.  We were seated after a short wait, in a section that we wanted.   I was disappointed that they didn't have frozen margaritas, but they had frozen bellinis so that's what I got. The waitress was very helpful in helping me find a decent cocktail for the night. The food was decent (I ordered the honey garlic wings) and so were the drinks, but the prices were a bit high. Also the bathrooms needed to be cleaned and restocked, and they seemed to be a bit understaffed. Not a bad spot considering."}
{"text":"Tis Shark Club is very accommodating which is nice!  Both times I have come now it has been on a Sunday when their specials are beer and cedars but no food specials which is too bad so I do not generally eat.  As well, both times I have been there it has been for promotional events that were being held they for example. The first one was the promotion of the Stampede 2018 music video made locally at ranchmans. The second event recently was for the promotion and launch of that same video but in French.  So far this place has been really accommodating and let us watch them on the big screen TV's but we also had new's reporters.  They are getting 4 stars though because my cesar had way to much worschteshire in it."}
{"text":"Food is good but chaotic billing and overcharged. 4 order of wings ($4.5each) , 2 pitcher ($18 each)?of beer and 4 drinks ($10 each ) after, got charged $180. They just added random drinks to our bills. BE WARE!! Had a good time but need some explanation to the bill."}
{"text":"DOUCHE BAG CENTRAL. Terrible service. Terrible drinks. Douche bag presentation at the entrance. BUT THE DJ WAS THE BALLS. WHO. IS. THIS. DJ?? You deserve better dude."}
{"text":"4 stars because of all the big screens and very lovely waitresses. I had the steak sandwich and it was tough and too rare. My friend had the roast beef dip and said it was good. The food is mediocre. Great atmosphere and drinks. It's a fun place and I'll come back."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was pretty good except for the fact that they brought out our appetizers AFTER the steak entrees. After eating the steak, the calamari was gross and soggy and we barely touched the huge plate of nachos. Worst part of it was, the nachos were more expensive than the entrees and untouched due to the poor timing of food delivery. Made me feel like throwing money down the toilet. Good place but don't forget to remind the waitress which order you would like your food to come in."}
{"text":"I only went here one time because I wanted to go to the patio at Jacks upstairs but they were on a wait and we were tired from an event in the area. The service was atrocious. The girl who served our table completely ignored my wife and her sister, choosing only to talk to me and my brother in law, I guess she thought if she flirted with us we would tip her more. It was very offensive. She forgot my sister in laws drink twice, bringing all the other ones. The food came out wrong, and tasted awful. it was just an awful experience all around. I will never be returning."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and catching the sports games, live DJ on the weekend was really good, had my friends and I dancing. Friendly staff, my server Heileen was very pleasant."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't have high hopes for food at a \"sports bar\" but I have to say I was quite pleasantly surprised. Friend and I needed a spot close to Costco, and this was one of the few places where we could meet AND have a glass of wine.  We both ordered the steak sandwich and were pleasantly surprised. Steak was on the smaller side (5.5 Oz) but that was ok for two ladies. Not sure it would've been enough for a guy. But it was done perfectly and was very tasty, a nice cut, well seasoned. Caesar salad was a little shy on dressing..half of it seemed like lettuce had no dressing at all, but the waitress kindly brought us some extra so it all worked out. Must say the onion rings were the best I have ever had anywhere.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Not terrible.  Not great.  Steak overdone. Caesar salad was pre made so s but soggy.   Fried foods were good."}
{"text":"I was so impressed the first time I went to Shark Club. I loved the atmosphere, the food and the service. I love your bathrooms! I have been back three times since and have had pleasant experiences. I was there for St. Patrick's Day. I ordered a shot of Jameson and along with it came pickle juice. I LOVE PICKLE JUICE!!!!! I will keep coming back here as long as you stick with what I have come to expect! My only suggestion is that you add more desserts to your menu."}
{"text":"Many tv screens with a lot of sports, food quality is great, proportions are a bit too small though. There wasn't anything snarky about shark club, would love to see a stuffed or blow up shark somewhere. Waitresses are nice, responsive and check up on the right frequency. The men are decent and friendly. The layout is really comfy. Nice cushion seats and many group tables. It's a new business, it really needs more roll on sharks since they mention it on their menu they really need an actual stuffed or blow up shark to complete its name."}
{"text":"DJ was pretty horrible. He's too busy talking to girls than doing his job. I came here to watch the blue Jay game and the music just took over the game. He kept forgetting to switch it over. Ruined the game and also my first experience here. Sucks because the food and hostess were great."}
{"text":"Went there last night actually, on a quiet family day for a late dinner and some beers. Loved this particular location due to the awesome staff and great food!! Had some wings to start and then the beef dip to finish. Great flavors, presentation and portion size. Pricing was right also.  They've got a lot of competition near this area but they sure  are setup to compete. Well done Shark Club"}
{"text":"This has gotta be one of the worst poutines I've ever eaten. Cheese curds with sharp cheddar and an odd garlic taste. Very disappointed.  What makes it even worse is when your server collects a plate from your table that looks EXACTLY the same as when they dropped it off and has nothing to say about it."}
{"text":"Disappointing. My friends and I went, just to check things out, and I personally was left wanting. First, it took a while for a waitress to come by with menus then another wait for her to come take drink orders the ANOTHER wait for her to come back with the drinks and take our food orders.  I got the nachos which were huge and actually pretty good but I will say it was on the pricy side. I added chicken and it came out to $22+ tax.  I ordered a drink while I was eating my nachos which never came but did come up on my bill. I told the waitress and she fixed it but again, after another wait.  We were there for two hours and I think our waitress came by twice to check up on us. :\"}
{"text":"I hadn't returned to the shark club after my last experience being under whelming.  I had a work event that had me returning. I was actually impressed mainly because of the service. the lady was running!! she was managing 2 large groups that had booked events and I know that can be hard to manage. food want cold and drinks were quick and she was on top of it they just kept coming.  Not my kind of place normally sports bars are just not my interest the beer menu is lacking and the food is mhh noting to rave about."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place (clearly she was too drunk to accurately recall being here) so I thought I would check it out for a girls night out. The worst idea ever. It took 20 minutes to get seated AT THE BAR and the bar tender was awful. She favoured the male clientele (obviously she thought they would tip her more than our group) and her butt crack was out the entire time. (Her crop top was also inappropriately short and her trashy arm tattoos did nothing for her) to make matters even more raunchy, my pal caught her PICKING HER NOSE right before putting a lime on a customers beer. GROSS!!! Will not be returning here."}
{"text":"My first review of a business in Toronto. Not because this was the best place I visited (cough ZOO) but because I have to start somewhere and this is a no brainer. I really can't see the negativity I've seen in other reviews.  It is located at the food court at a mall in Downtown (Dumas St.) and it is the only full service sit down restaurant on the third floor. We were attracted to it because it seemed like a cool happening place. We had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated, it was that busy. We came ton Wednesday night and got it right before happy hour was over, we were able to get a gin and tonic at HH price. They also had wing night, $0.45 cents per wing. We got that as an appetizer. We got the dry rub parmesan paprika I think it was called and they were amazing. I don't eat wings, and I had five!   As my entree I got butter chicken, it came with Jazmin rice and a crispy tortilla type accompaniment. I was surprised they had a couple of Indian dishes in the menu. I was skeptical to order, but it was delish.   Our waitress was really nice, came as often as she could, the place was totally packed. She explained to us that on wing night and depending who is playing they get really busy. I can understand some patrons may not like to wait a while for things, but then, go to a slower place. We really enjoyed our food and drinks."}
{"text":"We were here for just drinks. No particular game was on.  - Loud atmosphere, very dark with a lot of TV screens - They have happyhour/daily specials - I was there with a group of guy friends, the place was dominantly male as well  It's a sports bar. Too loud for me to return."}
{"text":"Wednesday cheap wings and cheap cider!!! It's great. Service is a bit slow but great and friendly. They're honestly just busy. :)"}
{"text":"Good environment. Terrible service.  The girls seriously care more about chatting amount themselves than serving the customers."}
{"text":"Very good place if you want to watch a sport game this is one of the best place to try. I came here to watch the euro cup for events like this try to come early for good seats and it is worth it. They have lots of TV screens that you can watch through and beer is always there with nice cups.   I tried some of the food it seems decent I would not say its the place place go get some burgers its more to come a have some beer and watch the game. There was 5 dollar entrance fee which is normal for these kind of even for bars like that.   The washrooms are amazing you have the look to dandas square while your taking a piss. It's special place I guess that you can only get at this place."}
{"text":"TVs galore, went for a MNF game and although it was fairly empty the staff was friendly and he scene was fun.  No wall space-it's all TVs.  Typical sports bar in the heart of the Yonge Dundas Square"}
{"text":"A modern version of Boston Pizza... We came to Calgary on a whim, very spur of the moment and ended up hanging out with friends who live in Calgary. Our friends suggested we go to Shark Club and insisted that it is one of the best  restaurants / bars in the city. Well...maybe it's because I'm an Edmontonian and am a little biased or maybe it's just because we have better taste but it really wasn't that impressive. In my opinion it wasn't much different than going to a Brewhouse or Local here. Sure it's modern decor and shinny but come on...do I look like a fish. Oooo something shiny  The food and service was really good but again not much different from another restaurant. It took a while to get everything but there were a few of us.   I'd would definitely go here again if our friends wanted to, great for watching the game as there are so many TVs and all in all a good regular place to hang out and have drinks."}
{"text":"Overpriced and poor service. Our waitress seated us and took our drinks orders and as she was bringing our drinks over we told her we wanted to move to the bar then she just dropped the drinks off at our table without moving them to the bar. I use to work as a waitress and a thoughtful server would have moved the drinks to the bar and not had the customers move them themselves."}
{"text":"Thai curry had the right amount of heat.. but way too many baby corn, and I dislike baby corn.  Wicked Thai soup (of the day) is good  Big Easy Burger is amazing.  Jambalaya is good and filling.  Lunchtime door staff is friendly."}
{"text":"As  previous review stated the Slider at this establishment are very poor quality.  I feel that a McDonalds hamburger not only taste better, but is also a much better value. $13 for three sliders that taste like they cam out of a frozen food section at your grocery store is UNACCEPTABLE for a restaurant. Yes I went during happy hour and got 50% off, but 50% was still to much for these snacks.  Other than the overview food I had the bar has lots of TVs for viewing any sport your hear could desire.    Two stars for the TVs Zero star for the food Zero stars for value Zero stars for portions"}
{"text":"second time coming here and not impressed at all. we usually come in a large group from work, the waitresses are great seeing they are dealing with a lot of tables but seem to always get to us and check in now and again.  Came here yesterday after work about 8 of us all ordering food and drinks. Prices are not cheap especially for the food. I ordered the Shark burger and fries along with a pint of Keiths. Burger was standard fries were a small portion and soggy.   Had the pleasure of meeting the general manager John as my friend and I ordered double gin and tonic when it got to us tasted completely off more like gin and tap water. Waitress returned the drinks immediately after John comes over hands me a glass of tonic and asks that I taste it it was regular tonic no issues his attitude implied that we were making a fuss for no reason however would like to mention we both took small sips out of the glass and then made the complaint however it made us feel like we were scamming. I ordered a rye and coke and my friend had a rum and coke. John sarcastically mentioned that they serve pepsi just in case I would return that drink because it didnt taste like coke.  Drinks arrived rye and pepsi were in seperate glasses as John wanted us to taste the mixer before adding to the Rye.  Overall the food is subpar not filling and overpriced. Save the money go to 3 brewers down the road or Joeys.  Would like to point out that in what world does a Steak Sandwich come on a single toasted piece of ciabatta bread should think to renaming it to Steak on toast.  The only plus about this place is the washrooms which says a lot."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place. Host was not friendly at all, drinks took way to long considering the place was pretty empty. Mcdonalds is down the street."}
{"text":"Place is OK. Nice venue, good looking servers, but if you're looking for quality food you came to the wrong place. Unless you don't care about quality and going for quantity and cheap eats.  Went on a Wednesday for their 39¢ cent wings with the purchase of a drink. Comes in multiples of 10 with about 6 or so choices for flavour. My friends got honey garlic and apparently tasted like soap. I got the hot wings. Nothing special, unless you think small sized wings are special.  Got a pint of beer for $3.99 except I'm pretty I'm sure it was a mini instead of a full pint.  My friends got regular pop and were told they don't do refills on the special wing days. Also don't expect veggie sticks with the Wednesday special because it doesn't come with it.  All in all, I most likely won't go back, even though it was so cheap."}
{"text":"Unprofessional operators who wouldn't honor an online reservation on a busy night to view a sporting event because I had no proof of \"confirmation\" and never made the short list. They wouldn't even let me inside to the bar unless I waited outside for 30 minutes before they opened up \"standing room\", whatever that means. The place wasn't even full so I have no idea why they took this odd stance. They just seem like jerks on a power trip. I will never return as there are better places without the pretentious and unforgiving attitude."}
{"text":"Between jack Astors and this place they're both terrible. Sharks is less terrible than jacks in terms of food and service. Came here to watch the Jays game, made us wait bc they said all tables were reserved, 10mins later they sat me at a table I asked about that did not have s reserved sign. What was the point of the wait?  Food was good inconsistent with how quickly the food comes out. The DJ (fat white guy) was terrible. Commenting on the game here and there, no one wants to hear you speak we'd rather here the professional commentators on tv!  I had to ask 4 times to turn up the volume of the game! That's what everyone is here for, THE GAME!!!   I'll give this place one more try before I give it 1 star. I hope they take reviews seriously."}
{"text":"The service was okay. We had to ask for menus . The drinks were good though I would say. The food was alright didn't sit well the next day. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs and garlic bread was on point! I would return for their drinks hopefully better service."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday and had an okay experience getting drinks and watching a UFC fight on the TV monitors surrounding the place.  I personally don't expect bar food to be good anyways as it is \"bar food\" after all so we just ordered beers and nachos, nothing big.  It's essentially a sleeker version of Hooters or a \"SmartWater\" version of your typical sports bar.  I would recommend this place as a hang out to watch any sporting events being broadcasted"}
{"text":"There is nothing wrong with it - I suppose but it looks like someone tried to spin a sports bar in to a lounge and at the last minute thought - hell why not make the female servers should dress like escorts. Cheasy. The bartender was nice and helpful. The beers fast and cold but something about the misogyny just made us want to leave.  Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Took way too long to get our food. I requested for extra ice in my drink. I had to ask 3 times."}
{"text":"First time here. We stopped in for a bite to eat while shopping in the area. They charged us a $5 cover charge per person because UFC was on. The waitress brought us the wrong beer and when we got our bill it was completely wrong.  This place wants to be a night club, but it's just a glorified pub with big tv's. We won't be returning. Ever. I would rather go to Denny's across the parking lot that come here again."}
{"text":"I go to sharkclub occasionally for their 0.39 cent wings and cheap Somersby on Wednesdays.  My experience hasn't been pleasant from the times I have visited the restaurant. First off, the service is terrible. The waitresses constantly forget about you, take forever too take your order after being seated and often are distracted by other stuff. The wings are really good, the only thing they have going for them. The only problem I have with them, is the fact that sometimes they are really small. I know they are cheaper on wednesday but i do expect them to be at a decent size. The atmosphere and decor is pretty good."}
{"text":"Awful service!  We work in the same building so this would be a very convenient choice if the service weren't so bad. Wait 10mins to be seated (not because it's busy but b/c no one is at the front door), get served if you are lucky (you usually have to go to the bar yourself), and wait a min of 1 hour for food. Try some of the other restaurants in the area like 3 Brewers."}
{"text":"Our small party chose a circular, semi-enclosed booth for our imbibing the other night - lit very dimly - which is fine despite the fact that the menus were hardly legible in that light - even for myself and my eyesight is fairly good in the dark. So I asked our awesome waitress to ask the manager to please turn them up just a wee bit so we could read - beers were brought, along with the reply which was \" the manager said that all the lighting was tied in together and that it couldn't be done...\" 8(    If it wasn't for the fact that we had already had our first sips while I was ingesting this retort - we would have been out the door! Two of the party members happen to be extremely well rounded commercial tradesmen, with 40 years experience of assembling commercial buildings, INCLUDING restaurants!!!!  I know for a fact that a cluster of pendants like the ones above our table were on a separate circuit - if she had just told us that the bar didn't want our table to stand out from the rest of the establishment, no prob...honesty is the best policy! So out came our phone LED's to browse the menus for several minutes, which probably drew way more attention than a quick temporary adjustment of the dimmer.    On this last note I'd like to illustrate that black pepper is generously used, even on sides as simple as peas and carrots, despite the shakers on the table!!! Steak was awesome though, as well as our waitress despite the lighting crap I'll say that!"}
{"text":"We stopped for gas and I eyed this place.  I had a pretty good chicken sandwich and my friend really liked his burger, and we both enjoyed the fries, but we had to keep asking for napkins, mayonnaise, water, etc.  If you like scantily clad toppy women who are okay servers, then you'll like this place. But I would hardly call this a Sports bar, maybe big screen bar or a big somethin' else bar.  We were very disappointed, especially for Canada, that they didn't show one hockey score and we were going to a Flames game that night."}
{"text":"Came to this place with a couple of buddies just to check it out after watching a movie upstairs. It's a pretty nice looking place, lots of big screens for watching the game and lots of attractive servers.   Food and drinks are about the same price as any other bar in the area, but the food quality is meh. Our server is constantly attentive and even separated our bills without even having to ask.   When we asked the server about the booths, we were introduced to the manager and had all our questions answered in a very friendly manner. What we liked learning best is that we did not need to have bottle service to reserve a booth. This pleased my friend a lot since he was looking for a place to celebrate his bday and was very impressed by the appearance of the venue.   The only beef I have with the place is its location. It's located above the future shop and below the Cineplex. I dunno why this bugs me, but it does. Other than that I had a really good time. Definitely a good place to go to if you're looking to just chill with your friends."}
{"text":"Hard to not give it four stars only because I enjoy the place a lot. The ambience is great. I go with work people so I enjoy it for that reason. Managers are great if you have an issue. Drink specials are great. Service is not that good  except for a couple of waitresses .... (e.g. Tessa is lovely). Food sucks food specials or not - if they don't revamp the menu soon they will lose business and not know what hit them."}
{"text":"You know what, this place IMHO is better then Real Sports Bar and Grill.  The view and location on Yonge and Spadina and cheaper then Real Sports.  Better service IMHO too.  Yeah they don't have that huge screen Real does but I don't care, I like this place more."}
{"text":"Oh no, first try was a total failure. Bad service, mediocre food. But I might give them another chance sometime soon :)"}
{"text":"Apparently management thinks they can get away with a miscommunication that's involves an extra 16 shots and over $100 dollars on your bill. And when you question your bill the manager Brianna does the least bit possible to even recognize fault, instead the bartender, Brianna , and our waitress made three failed attempts at correcting charges for a table of five that was there for only and hour and a half. Keep in mind most of that hour and a half was spent waiting 20-30 minutes in between drinks. This was literally the worst customer service experience I've ever had.  I didn't even mention the rude commentary made by the DJ and the \"security\". Also don't try contacting the general manager, whose number is on the company's business cards, the security guard answers the phone and pretends he doesn't know who your talking about. This place is a complete waste of time."}
{"text":"My friend recommended to try shark club because of the super tasty vegetarian burger. However, being a fan of Thai tuna salad at jack Astors, I have to order Thai tuna salad in shark club as well! Maybe it is because I'm ordering salad instead of vegetarian burger, it didn't meet my expectation. It's just not as good in terms of volume and taste and amount of seared tuna as the jack actors tuna salad.  My friend got the steak frites but switched fries with boiled vegetable. Although this was not an option on the menu, the waitress kindly ask the kitchen to accommodate! Kudos for accommodating diet restraint!"}
{"text":"First time I went here I was a little curious about the layout. There are a bunch of circular booths for tables that look like the kind of place you'd sit at with a girl and hide some of your under the table antics, but as I strolled around I was greeted by more than one staff member with a friendly hello or how are you.  The large bar at the center of Shark Club is a great place to sit and watch one of the many tv's with a beer or, check out the massive video screen in the NW corner playing the big game of the night.  I've gone more and more on wing night, Wednesdays, for a signature flavour, named after the bar itself. It's a combination of hot sauce, BBQ sauce, and a mustard that has to be tasted to be understood.  This is a great place to unwind after work or catch a weekend game."}
{"text":"5 star specials 4 star food 4 star service 4 star ambience   This visit I had a fried chicken sandwich , a blue moon, salad and fries  The fried chicken sandwich was one of the best I've had and a nice portion Besides over dressing the salad, it was a solid grub and the beer was cold. The service could have been better but was not bad."}
{"text":"Mixed alcoholic drinks were great. I don't remember the names but all 3 I tried were delicious and I don't usually like the taste of alcohol at all. Each drink was around $10.  Our group of 4 waited outside at 6:30pm for 20 mins for the Wednesday wing night. There was a bball game playing later at night so when we left around 8pm, the line outside had about 20 people.  I got 1lb of wings which was $5 with a drink. It comes with either blue cheese or ranch sauce. I liked both sauces. The blue cheese tasted like regular cheese.  I chose habanero salt which we all agreed just tasted like \"plain fried\". I was expecting it to be spicy. If anything, it was a tiny bit tangy. I liked my friends salt and pepper much better. It wasnt as plain as I had thought. I think they added lemon juice on top. We also really liked the honey garlic. One of my friends found it TOO saucy and switched plates with someone else.  We also agreeded that the wings were very small. Tiniest chicken wings I've seen...  $5 wings is a good price but the drinks are way too expensive, making the deal not worth. They also don't have as many flavour options to choose from as other wing/bar joints. I also disliked how you only get wings and no fries!!! We all just ate wings for dinner... This was definitely not my favourite bar or wings joint and I would not come back if I had to. Wings were not amazing.  Golden shark - I asked them what this flavour was. They said its half bbq sauce and half hot sauce. Very golden recipe...."}
{"text":"Spaghetti with meatballs comes in a Huge portion and it is very good! The Thai tuna was disappointing, not the best quality or sear of tuna. Smoked Parmesan wings were very crispy and good. Edamame was great."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place. The first thing I noticed was the loud music, I had difficulty hearing the server explain the happy hour specials. He did recommend me a good beer. I had the fish and chip burger.  The fish in the burger was moist and tasty but the chips were a bit too crispy. There was a side salad but it had too much dressing. It is a nice restaurant but too noisy for me."}
{"text":"Oh the burbs. It's an entirely different life out yonder, I understand. Your choice of places to go is rather limited, and it's a long trek to the inner city sometimes for a different flavour.  Though I may find burb choices rather cookie cutter, at the very least many of your options aren't crap. Shark Club is one of those. I don't see much difference between it, Earl's, Moxie's, Joey's and every other restaurant of that kind except that it's not a restaurant, but a club/pub/lounge type deal with scores of big screen TVs, a large patio up top and an area that turns into a dance floor by night. Otherwise, it's a similar vibe, similar selection of food and drink, similar clientele and staff.  Bonus: Local beer on tap... as in a little WR Wraspberry. For that, if I could, I would give you an extra half star dear Shark Club. Thanks for bringing those pints of goodness to my friends in the burbs."}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at this Shark Club.  I've been to the one in Toronto and liked it.  I ordered wings ... half with Golden Shark sauce (apparently BBQ sauce with hot sauce) and half with honey garlic.  The wings were good, though I liked the honey garlic ones better.  I found my server disinterested.  I'd have to wait a long while for another drink and my bill.  Even when she was talking to me, she wasn't \"present\".  I wouldn't go back to this location."}
{"text":"After a movie, we stopped in at the Shark Club, which is in the same complex.  It opened in the fall and and we hadn't been so we thought we'd check it out.  We sat by a window.  We both ordered wings.  I got Golden Shark (medium/hot sauce).  They were okay.  There were 11 to a pound.  Gord got Salt & Pepper.  He liked them  The bathrooms were interesting.  The women's side had stalls.  The guys' side, toward the windows, had stalls too but also a couple urinals.  I went to the couch by the window and I see down at the urinals.  Eeeek!  Gwen was our server and she took good care of us.  I'd go back!  It's a great place if you are a sports fan."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Lots of TVs including one GIANT TV so this would be great also for a sports night! The night I went there was a DJ playing music - old school fun things - I enjoyed it. Apparently on the weekends they also have a DJ and a guess a bit more dancing with a dance floor.... sometimes with guest DJ's too. Wed wings night $0.25 wings. Service was good too.  picture the lounge at moxies but on a bigger scale and newer."}
{"text":"Wings. Go for the wings. On Wednesday. $3.50 for 10 wings in downtown Toronto? Ridiculous. (With the purchase of a drink, but that drink can be a soda)   With that said the wings are soso. They're a lot of batter, fat, and sauce, but sometimes you're just in that mood. The location and service makes up for the quality though  Other than wingday however, I don't think I'd ever go here. There are soooooo many other options near the spot.   If you're a tourist in town on a Wednesday however. Get yo self some wings!   I recommend the honey garlic. The Korean spice was definitely Korean hot bean paste but didn't taste like anything a Korean would make (go to kaboom instead)   The golden shark one is good too  But yeah again, I wouldn't go if it weren't wingsday and if I wanted to feel healthy any time soon."}
{"text":"This placed sucked big time!   A few girlfriends and I went for ladies night on Friday since we figured we'd try something new.   After waiting for 15 minutes to be seated (which we didn't mind since it was a game night) we got placed in a ranchy area beside a group of 30 loud men. The waiters might be nice on the eyes but they suck in service. Our waiter dropped by twice. Once to drop us water and the next to grab payment. She smelt like horrible BO anyways so avoid her. Tall lanky girl with extensions that didn't match her real hair and a really ugly nose.  We waited 30 minutes for food while female servers flaunted their small boobies to all the male customers hoping to make a nice tip. The music was LOOOOOUDD. I mean so loud it was literally a notch away from club fist pumping music.   I give it a 2 because the food was alright. Nothing I couldn't get from somewhere else. But EVERYTHING else about this place sucks big time.  Never returning. Clearly."}
{"text":"Came here after watching a movie so both of us were looking tired, got a grilling by the security guard about pre-drinking and a lot of other accusations which really pissed me off. Normally I just walk away at that point, but my friend wanted to visit, so I played along.  Music is a mash of new pop/rap music and edm which isnt too bad. Plenty of screens which have most things on, but I was surprised that at least half were playing the news which was boring. Drink selection is decent, the place has plenty of seating and its clean. Service here is near non existent, since I had to go up to the bar twice just to get a server then it took roughly 30min just to get simple drinks. The food here really is terrible, avoid it like the plague.  Great location, yet terrible people, go next door to milestones and have a better time"}
{"text":"Too bad yelp doesn't allow 0 stars, after our experience tonight - I'd actually give it negative stars if I could.  We went in a little after 5pm on a Saturday and they seated us even without a reservation. It took us about half an hour to finally get the first round of drinks and 45 minutes to get the nachos appetizer which were burnt. The plates they gave us for the apps were crusty with food bits. An hour and 45 minutes since we were seated, we finally got our entrées (while the table beside us, who were seated later, were almost finished). Not once did the waitress come to ask if we needed anything or inform us about why it was taking so long. We asked to speak to the manager who then offered to have the food on the house and was attentive for all of 5 minutes after our complaint. After she offered that, she, too, was nowhere to be found.   In terms of food - one entrée was forgotten and another came with the wrong side order. The steak sandwich was literally a small piece of overcooked steak on top of a baguette. The fish tacos had 5 pieces of dried out seared ahi tuna and 6 soft tacos- it was supposed to be an appetizer for sharing but I guess someone would just have the taco itself? The jambalaya and chicken quesadillas were okay. The fries were over-salted and the dish it came in was somehow all greasy to touch.   I've never been to a restaurant where service was this inattentive and slow- I'm not sure how it would function when there are lots of sports fans.   I've also never left a meal where no one at the table wanted to leave a tip."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!! the place was so dead and they still somehow took 30 minutes to serve the appy of shark bites.  It took another 15 minutes to get our food, which came out WRONG!!!   They took no ownership of the poor service and the manager acted like a clown, as though everything is a joke.  This place is good for drinks and tv ONLY..."}
{"text":"Had the Steak Frites and Buttermilk fried chicken burger.  I have to give it credit for the burger looking like the picture on advertisement.  Often the disparity is so great, here not so much.  Service was fine, location was good.  Nice place for a sit down lunch.  Steak Frites was interesting.  Few bites of steak with lots of fries, almost as if the steak was the side.  Beef was chewy.  Fried chicken burger was good, pretty good deal with a beer for $15."}
{"text":"This is my first review ever on yelp. I checked in after work for the world Junior gold medal game. Place was busy and I enjoyed the large screens at the bar. I took advantage of the 50% off appetizers and ordered the sliders and tater tots. Great place for a sports bar."}
{"text":"Decent food. The spinach dip was good, however the nacho chips that came with it were stale and bland. I had to order pita bread with it inside. We also got the bbq pizza and the shark pizza which weren't anything too special. Good service although the waitresses weren't wearing a lot of clothing. And the washrooms are cool. Everyone gets their own stall with a mirror and sink."}
{"text":"Meat market was the first thing we thought after sitting down. Large space, lots of TV's good for watching \"the game\", but not from everywhere in there. Poor placement of some seating for views.   The food = HORRIFYING.   We ordered an appy that was essentially a wheat tortilla buttered in cream cheese, rolled and sliced into 8th's. Sick.  He had the Veggie burger with onion rings which he said tasted like it was bought from costco down the way.   She had the taco salad less meat. I can't say too much about this other than the fact that for $14 you got 1 cup of brown romaine topped with 1 tbsp of canned corn, 1 tbsp of black beans, 1/4 cup of pre-shredded tex-mex cheese and some hurting \"taco\" invention on the side. Disgusting.   He had two beers which he said were warm and flat. She had a double caesar (ordered spicy and came BLAND) and a double Gin & Tonic with some variety of \"super sonic\" like at Joeys, but had no taste and was meh for $10 per cocktail. The second service was totally forgotten and had to be ordered twice.   Left feeling ill, but ate as we hadn't all day. Both still feeling sick to our stomachs hours later.   AVOID unless you're going for sub-par pub food and maybe to catch a game if you happen to be at ikea/costco first.   Ick ick ick.   Being from Vancouver, I thought I would see what homage was paid. The Van locations aren't that great but at least the food isn't barf served luke warm, without utensils etc..."}
{"text":"My partner and I had lunch at Shark Club on a Wednesday.  We arrived around 11:30 and there was only two other people seated at one table.  Three servers were standing around the bar and didn't make a move to welcome us so after waiting for a couple minutes we seated ourselves.  We ordered the sliders and they were the worst we've ever had.  Overcooked, unflavourful meat, processed cheese with shredded lettuce and stale buns.  Horrible.  For our entrees we ordered jambalaya and the ginger beef bowl, which was recommended.  The jambalaya was extremely spicy, and my partner regularly orders jambalaya in restaurants so it is not a problem with spicy food.  There was only one small piece of sausage in the whole dish.  My ginger beef bowl was like a bowl of sugar, with sugar sauce.  Except for the abundance of red onion, the vegetables appeared to be from a bag of frozen vegetables like you would buy at the grocery store, and only just the smallest leftover pieces.  For example, there were just few small pieces of wilted broccoli the size of a dime each.  Both dishes came with Jasmine rice and there was no option to substitute brown rice, the server said they only had Jasmine rice and nothing else.  Our server never asked how the food was.  A man in a sport coat with an earpiece (seriously, what?) came by and asked how the sliders were and I said they were \"meh, OK.\" and he just kept walking.  If I have to find one bright spot it would be that the server was attentive to drinks, and did refill our water.  Overall it was a terrible dining experience.  We dine out often and will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is fine if you're just going to catch a game and grab a drink without much expectations. Tons of screens to watch your favourite team on. Service however is below par. Every time I've been there, the servers take forever to initially serve us, even longer to get our drinks, and oftentimes mess up our food orders. The food is bland, as well. I don't plan on ever going again (especially when Jack Astor's and Milestones is only 30 seconds away...)."}
{"text":"I was already far from impressed with this place before my last visit. After being convinced by my friend (who lives close by) to give this place another shot, I will most certainly not make that mistake again.    Someone can ignore this place's obnoxious and unnecessarily loud music, playing in a failed attempt to combine lounge/club with sports bar. However, the mediocre food is nowhere near good enough to justify the high prices or terribly poor service. The customer service was sub-par the previous time I was here, but this last visit ensured I will not come back to Shark Club.  We excused having to wait 10 minutes before our waitress Niki even came by to give us menus, despite it not actually being that busy. We excused her not bringing us utensils until we asked. My patience wore thin when I had to try and flag down Niki 4 TIMES so we could place our order. The first time she walked right by us, I assumed she must not have noticed us. The second time (and knowing she looked right at me), I assumed she had to do something else and would be back promptly. This happened two more times where the waitress looked right at us, and then proceeded to ignore - no signal or acknowledgement at all.   After finally being able to order, and receiving our food/beers, we asked for a few glasses of water. Given our waitress' terrible customer service up to that point, I actually bet my friend that she would not bring the waters to us - I won that bet. About 20 minutes after our request, and noticing that Niki was too busy sitting/chatting with some guys at another table that were not even her customers (i.e. she was not working), we went to the bar and grabbed our waters ourselves.  The only positive about this place is its convenient location at Yonge/Dundas. With this terrible service and mediocre food, people are going to start realizing that they can get decent beer/bar food at lower prices at a slew of other places in this area. For me, I already gave Shark Club one chance too many..."}
{"text":"This place has a really good atmosphere with lots of tv's and decent food. there dessert menu is lacking with only a couple choices though."}
{"text":"After shopping for furniture at the good 'ol blue building (of the Swedish variety) we needed a place to have dinner.  The Deerfoot Meadows area has a good selection of eats, except most close down at 7 or 8pm.  My handy Yelp Mobile app to the rescue...  This place has some pretty bleak reviews so I was reluctant.  However, the stomach was calling and my wife and I were hangry so we decided to try it regardless.  As we entered we were immediately taken by the huge screen where they play sports.  At the time the Flames were playing... yey!  But they were losing... boo!  Being a sports bar you find your own table.  We found one just to the right of the bar.  The atmosphere was quite alive for a Tuesday night.  I'm sure they have a few travelers from the Sandman Hotel next door.  The serving staff was quite friendly and very attentive.  They came by every few minutes it seemed and asked if we needed anything.  Sometimes we'd see a different  server asking if we needed help.  That's tag team service!  Because of allergies we alerted them before ordering, they were very careful to talk to the kitchen.  The manager came out and even gave us his assurance we were safe with our selections.  When the food came out one of the chefs talked to us and let us know the food was safe for us to eat as well.  That was re-assuring for sure.  For appetizers we had the deep friend mac & cheese balls... so good and perfect with the ketchup and saracha dipping sauce.  We both had the shark burgers and the burgers were as good as you'd get a a Moxies or even an Earl's.   The serving staff... well how do I put this nicely, all were easy on the eyes.  It's great to see a place that can dish up good service, good food at a decent price and not have to rely on the \"atmosphere\" if you know what I mean.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice for a sports bar. Happy hour specials are pretty awesome, it was Monday and you could get a house wine for four dollars or a margarita for four dollars.   Appetizers of dirty chips, tater tot's or sliders until 7 PM also were discounted at 50% off, we tried the sliders and they were like little big Macs, pretty good.  We also ordered a sirloin steak with vegetables and smashed baby potatoes. Well seasoned, cooked well and tasted good.  The best part was we got to watch the game on a really big screen. It was a nice comfortable view and the customer service was very good. At the time we went the restaurant was maybe only a quarter full but staff was attentive.   Also fun is there is a patio for summertime get-togethers and booths inside are roomy and comfortable."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the reason for this rating is: 1. Service was lacking, our waitress completely forgot my one order--Poutine. 2. Poutine was not hot, barely warm. 3. Service came by every 45 minutes so all we were able to order was 2 drinks each and poutine.  If it wasn't the proximity of the location--it's not a \"pick\" for a pre planned place for sure.  It is decent if you want to catch a game and have drinks--otherwise expect long wait times!  Monday night is Margherita half price, $4.95--the lime is the the best, strawberry was to sweet and raspberry left a weird taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"Don't go in expecting more than bar food, but if this is all you're after and love happy hour specials then this place will get the job done!  Typical loud sports bar, with the game playing on tv's scattered throughout the restaurant and music playing over top. Service has always been really friendly and quick and it's right above Dundas station so it is super easy to get to.  LOVE their happy hour specials. Who can say no to a $4 glass of wine?! In terms of food We have also tried the happy hour specials: tater tots (my FAV), dirty fries (good but I hate blue cheese so I always order without) and the sliders (I haven't tried but my bf said they pass) - all at approx $5/6 each. You can't lose.  Definitely one of my go to places for after work drinks when I'm just looking to go somewhere easy going and easy to get to."}
{"text":"Good location, decent prices, but service was really slow. It took awhile for literally everything, from getting seated to putting in our order to getting our check. We were a party of 2 on a Wednesday night, the place was hardly busy.   Service aside, the happy hour deals seemed pretty good. We were only there for a few drinks and enjoyed everything we ordered."}
{"text":"Like most people here, I've had a disappointing experience at Shark Club. The location is top notch, the service can be better but the food was a let down. There are a bunch of similar restaurants nearby with the same quality of bar food so nothing really stands out.  I had the burger and fries, burger was tough and dry, bun was a bit stale. Fries were not crispy. I tried my friends sliders and it was the same."}
{"text":"I am sad to say that this place is lacking!!  Great atmosphere - but we had to send back our food twice.  How hard is it to serve hot food?!  We ordered calamari and it was not cooked on the inside, then later we ordered wings and they came to our table cold.  The plate was warm - but the wings soggy and cold.  Drinks were made well, but glass size was inconsistent.  Too bad - there needs to be a good bar/pub in that area!   Funny with all of the reviews about COLD FOOD nothing has been done yet!!"}
{"text":"OMG, my friend has been raving about this place since the day i met him. He finally got me out one Friday night after 2 years of bugging me. We ended up downtown at this place and let me just tell you the SERVICE was embarrassing to the organization. Our waitress barely came around, and by the time i was ready to order my next drink she was no where in sight. I ordered a glass of wine to start and some appetizers. I was extremely interested in the Bull Dog drink which is a frozen margarita with a beer upside down in it. Finally after trying to flag her down a couple of times i placed my order.... 20 minutes later still no drink and no sight of our server. Finally after waiting another 10 minutes i flagged her over. I asked about the drink and she looked  like a deer caught in headlights. She then caught herself and said it would just be a few moments. 5 mins later she returned to tell me that they had run our of ice for the slushy machine and i would not be able to order that drink. I was livid considering i had placed that order 35 mins prior and saw those drinks coming out of the bar to other customers.   will i return, not anytime soon"}
{"text":"I've been there SO many times because it was close to home and I was disappointed every single time. Fool me once, shame on you... Fool me 72 times; I must be a masochist, or need psychiatric help. I went a while back after boycotting \"Shart\" Club for over a year (for the poor service and badly cooked food)... and unfortunately they confirmed that the service was still horrible!!! The food however was MUCH better this time so I will give them credit for that... but nothing else. I was there for literally 5 hours for a birthday and was asked if I needed a drink 2 times.  This was also the case for basically every one of the 22 guests at the bday . The waitress would dissappear for 45 minutes at a time to do God knows what? She was only \"serving\" our section. So we were forced to go to the bar to order drinks because we literally could not get service.  We even approached the manager to tell him the service was horrible and he \"promised\" to send additional staff over to help clean up and take orders... Nobody ever came and we did not see the manager again. While ordering from the bar I was charged 3 different prices throughout the night for the same order, varying from $6-10. Not sure if the staff is poorly trained, or just trying to include a tip for themselves but either way that is a huge problem for me! While sitting at the tables the empty glasses kept piling up because there were no bus staff working at all... But somehow there are 4 bouncers to reject people from their \"elite establishment\". At the end of the night I paid my bill (after waiting 20 minutes) and hung around to chat with friends. Somehow I was then was asked to pay the bill 3 more times because the waitress didn't remember me or something??? Just brutal!!  I can't even put it into words how bad the experience was. I will definitely NOT be back and have already posted a scathing review on my Facebook page and several other places and have told anyone who will listen not to go there. These guys could really stand to watch a few seasons of Bar Rescue and take some notes."}
{"text":"This past Saturday evening, my friend and I were looking for a place to eat downtown. We had planned to go to an old favourite, Jack Astor's (located in the same building), but were told there would be a 25 minute wait. We were hungry, so we decided to head downstairs and check out the Shark Club Sports Bar & Grill.   The first thing we noticed was a seemingly unhappy and, to be honest, unnecessary doorman. He told us there was no wait to be seated so we got a table. This proved to be misleading as we waited about 15 minutes for our server to come over. She seemed to be one of the only servers in the entire restaurant, which wasn't overly busy. She took our orders, I went for the chicken pesto quesadilla with poutine and my friend ordered the four cheese poutine appetizer. The food arrived in a timely fashion and resulted in differing opinions on quality. I honestly enjoyed my meal and was satisfied. My friend, on the other hand, found his fries to be overdone and his cheese to be poorly prepared. He was not satisfied and didn't finish.   The service itself was somewhat lacking. When our server did come to the table, she was polite enough. However, there were several small annoyances that arose. First, they were out of Rolling Rock for a pitcher. Then, it took several trips for her to come back with a diet coke refill I requested. These wouldn't be as significant if the restaurant offered consistently timely service. The long delays in-between compounded the issue.  The atmosphere was a bit hit or miss. As I said, the doorman seemed superfluous. As well, the amount of TVs they have going mixed with the loud music seemed more than a little overbearing. On the other hand, the bathrooms were surprisingly nice and clean. It really is a nice view as mentioned in a previous review.  In conclusion, were we happy with the experience - not really. While I did enjoy my food, it's nothing you couldn't find elsewhere in the same radius. In fact, many of the menu items are the same as Jack Astor's, to the point that if they were the same company, it wouldn't surprise me. I'd recommend waiting for Jacks or taking a walk somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wow. Let me just start this with.. This place has terrible management. If I could, I'd give this place zero stars. I went here with a few friends, and we ordered drinks, celebrating our first time in Canada. However, management (Brianna) saw fit to charge us TRIPLE the price for shots (\"on accident\"). We got a bill for almost $400, and they quickly refused to talk reasonably about the bill. DO NOT DRINK HERE FOR FUN!! They WILL try to over-charge you, and there is no way to get out of it because, like they did to us, the whole bar starts to gang up against you. HERE IS THE WORST PART: I asked for the managers card, AND THEY GAVE US A CARD WITH THE DJ's NUMBER! This place is irresponsible and inconsiderate! Americans and Canadians be warned!"}
{"text":"We were invited back after finding hair in our food. We decided to give them another chance. We went in on Friday and fully expected it to be busy and to have to wait. Jack's knows how to handle busy.   The shark club doesn't believe in a registration system and informs guests to have a seat at the bar and we'll let you know when your table is ready. Without wanting to take our name the host proceeded to seat numerous guests to tables around us. We decided to get appetizers and a few drinks before our tables was going to be ready but we ended up spending over an hour at the bar after repeatedly checking in with the host and being assured we were next.   Finally giving up we ordered our food and committed to eating at the bar, despite our original plans. A few minutes later our table was ready and we were transferred to our table and were asked to settle up prior to sitting. We had asked if our entrees would be transferred or would we need to replace the order. The bartender said I will let her know just settle up your tab.   Needless to say anymore you can guess what wasn't transferred and were left for us to finally get attention of a waitress to take our order. The place is filled with big screens and little black dresses but forgets the simple tasks of hospitality and customer service.   Although I had a $40.00 off coupon and didn't bother bring this lackluster customer experience to their attention again. I will not return to this location and hope they revisit their leadership team. I am used to the shark club in Vancouver which always provides a next to none lounge and dining experience. This one however, is awful."}
{"text":"Ordered a poutine with pulled pork and it was automatically the worst I have ever had  that I really struggled to finish it. When I'm paying a good 15 dollars for a poutine I except it to be better than McDonalds yet even Mcdonalds has better poutine than this, the poutine had stale fries that tasted like they were sitting for a while (very dense and dry) gravy was standard and the pulled pork did not taste fresh at all nor did it have any bbq flavour also am i allowed to mention how ridiculously salty this poutine was? I don't know who thought it would be appropriate to dump so much salt on the fries but it didn't make them any less staler than they were. Our waitress was almost non existent so had to flag another one down to deliver some sauces to make this poutine somewhat palatable. When we finally flagged our waitress down to get the bill she had trouble understanding that we wanted separate bills and instead split the poutine-- simple miss-communication so we asked to have it fixed and she was very rude about it and looked almost displeased.  I decided not to tip because of the horrible food but figured I might tip a little because the service was mediocre at best right after I finished paying for my meal with my debit card the waitress had the nerve to assume I wasn't going to tip and asked If there was something wrong with her service (this was right before my friend who was also with me had a chance to pay for her meal). I don't know about  you, but some people like to pay by debit and tip with cash/ change-- I know I've done that a lot of times and the fact she even asked before all of us has a chance to finish paying just left me flabbergasted. Was really off putting and in the end I decided not to tip at all. I'm sorry but if the food is disgusting AND the service was bad enough that you find it difficult to fix a simple mistake on a receipt, why and how can you expect me to tip at all? Just because servers barely make minimum?  I work retail which is just as strenuous if not more than being a server and we may make minimum but we still have to do our jobs and earn that pay and not just expect it for granted or get paid for showing up and doing the bare minimum of what is expected of us :/  Never going again, and really regret not going to St.Louis or Three Brewers which are leaps above this horrible place. Also I don't understand the concept of IDing everyone at the door as if this is some high class place when it's just a chain sports bar in a mall of all places :/."}
{"text":"Appetizers were good. Went to a sports bar in Canada to see Stanley cup finals game 1. Saw some until the basketball game came on. Raptors?. Nope. Two teams from USA. Got up and left. They will never see me again. Beer selection was just ok. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Cool place SHIT Food. I can be pleased by McDonald burger and I HATED the burger here. Super super salty, burnt meat...shitty patty...hot waitresses though"}
{"text":"The three stars are for the multitude of TVs and the various sports therein, the happy hour, etc. The lack of two stars is the away from the actual bar wait service. (No acknowledgment and there were only 20 people in the place) Also, there is no healthy food here folks..."}
{"text":"The Shark Club, at its newest loctation in the North East.  First I want to rant about loctation.  If your a transit user, good luck. You would catch a ctrain to rundle station then transfer (ended up cab'ing) to a bus.  Driving wise its still pretty inconvient to get to. Its not off Barlow (for obvious reasons lol) but off that side street. And you have to drive into the parking lot of a Hooters, drive around to another Parking lot, Toad and Turtle, then your finally at the Shark Club. After the commute my husband wanted to call it quits and head to Hooters.  Food wise - nothing special. Nothings fresh, they are a sysco junkie. Kinda pricey., especially drinks.   The outside looks cool, a little fancy but a little fun. From the outside you can see all the huge TVs and the big bar, looks like fun. But for this gal its not worth it.  Loctation, loctation, loctation.   (and really, behind a Hooters? No ones going to drive around boobies for over priced sysco food)"}
{"text":"This place seems to get a lot of negative reviews, but we came here to watch a Flames playoff game.   During the game beforehand, it was obnoxious, and super loud - there was a DJ playing in between each play, and the music was way too loud.      However, as soon as that game ended and the Flames game come on, the place was much more enjoyable.   We moved to the bar to take in the large screen.   The staff treated us politely, and the manager even made sure to come over after he noticed other fans drunkenly yelling at us from across the bar.   Very commendable that he noticed, and took time to ensure we weren't feeling harassed (which we weren't).  The food is standard pub fare, and the drinks as well, but it you want to catch a game, they have a lot of TVs and good service."}
{"text":"Atmosphere's great. Wings are mediocre, but for 45 cents a pound (on Wednesdays only), you get what you pay for. Most disappointing of all is their watered down shots--I can't emphasize that enough. $8.50 for a shot of Jose Cuervo that tasted like 2/3 water and 1/3 tequila? Smh. Come to eat and listen to hip/hop, trap and Top 40s, but go elsewhere to drink."}
