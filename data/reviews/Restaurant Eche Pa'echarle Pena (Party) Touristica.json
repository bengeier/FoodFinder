{"text":"I had the Ceviche Mixto with onions and yucca. A civiche of mixed seafood and herbs - shrimp, fish, squid, octopus, clams, scallops and surf clam - a true medley of seafood. It was extremely fresh; the seafood did not taste defrosted (maybe the fact that Jean Talon Market was right around the corner has something to do with this). Having raw seafood being \"cooked\" with acid (lime) might sound a big adventurous, but when it's done right, it can be quite exciting."}
{"text":"The place is pretty simple, and they were nice enough to found  us space even if it was a saturday and we were 10 ! 

We ate a whole chicken for 4, and this is the best things to do if you're 4. You have fries, plantain chips and even soft drink for around 12 taxes included. 

So it's not expensive and my peruvian friend told me that it's like home there. I like the marinated chicken cooked on charcoal ! Have to try the sea food here later this years. I have to try another peruvian restaurants to make comparisons.

Update : i tried the Moro con hunange( ceviche) A fish ( grouper) cooked naturally with lime. It was a light refreshingly meal. I've never tried it before and i recommend you try it !

L'endroit est simple et les employés ont été assez gentils pour nous trouvez de la place pour souper même si c'était un samedi soir et que  nous étions nombreux (10 personnes). 

Ce n'est pas tellement dispendieux et  mon amis péruvien dis que c'est comme au Pérou !

Je suggère que vous commandiez un poulet complet si vous êtes 4 personnes. Les frites, les chips au plantain et 2 litres de boisson gazeuse inca cola ou un breuvage de chicha (boisson a base de maîs du Pérou, sont compris pour ce repas à un prix de 12$ taxes incluses. 

Le poulet mariné cuit au charbon de bois est succulent et je le recommande grandement ! J'aimerais cependant essayer les fruits de mer plus tard cette année !

Je dois essayer plusieurs restaurants Peruviens afin de pouvoir comparer !

Misa à jour : J'ai essayé le Mero con huang ( ceviche) : une salade de poisson cuit naturellement dans la lime ( non cuit de façon usuelle). Et c'était excellent et quelque chose que je ne connaissait pas. Vous devriez essayer cela !"}
{"text":"De très bonnes portions pour un prix correct, la bouffe est délicieuse! J'ai mangé la cuisse de poulet sur charbon de bois et c'était succulent. Le vin se vend à la bouteille, ça nous a couté un gros 8$ (!) pour deux bouteilles de vin séparées à 5. Un endroit simple, authentique et sans prétention... Et un gros shout out à la couverte de lama."}
{"text":"Long overdue review from me about this Peruvian gem in north Montreal, just that side of the Jean Talon shopping complex. We have been to this restaurant many times, and having lived in Peru for a couple of years, I can attest to the authenticity of the menu and its preparation. The establishment is not very big, and a couple of years ago, it expanded its offering to include the famous Peruvian rotisserie chicken. Ambience is simple and on certain nights, it even offers live entertainment. Otherwise like typical eateries in Peru, there is a large screen TV with Latino entertainment.

Food-wise, it is Peruvian to the last crumb and drop. The appetizers include an amazing papas a la huancaina (sliced boiled potatoes covered with a savoury and creamy yellow pepper sauce and garnished with sliced boiled eggs and black olives), and tamales (cornflour dumplings with pork stuffing) among other favourites. Ceviche abounds with various seafood, and is served in traditional style, i.e. large grain Peruvian corn on cob, a piece of boiled yucca, and the ceviche itself of whatever seafood marinated in a piquant salad of red onions, peppers and lime juice. Not to be missed! Main entrees include savoury stews (try the chupe de camarones with the extra large shrimp in shell!), aji de gallina (shredded chicken cooked in the aromatic and savoury Peruvian yellow pepper sauce), arroz con mariscos (seafood served with rice prepared with cilantro - something like paella), and of course the rotisseries chicken. 

I am not too crazy about traditional Peruvian desserts, I find them too sweet for my taste but for those who like them, they also make sweet rice pudding, alfajores (cookie made of flour, nuts and honey, and a centre filling of caramel), and \"flan\" (sort of custard tart without the crust, lightly covered with sweet syrup). The place also serves traditional Peruvian chicha (lightly sweet beverage made from purple corn - refreshing flavour) and of course Inka Kola (Peru's answer to Coca Cola; a bright yellow soda that tastes like cream soda).

The prices are somewhat on the high side but it is well worth the visit to sample what I consider to be best of South American cuisine which is expertly prepared here. In fact, Peruvian cuisine has now caught on in New York and Western Europe as more people have discovered its remarkable range of spices and flavours so unlike any other neighbouring cuisine in South America. If you like Mexican or Indian food, you will LOVE Peruvian food."}
{"text":"We really enjoy Peruvian chicken. Thankfully Eche Pa'echarle is just a few blocks from our place. The chicken is incredible! I am not sure what they marinade it in or how long they roast it, but we are big fans!

We love a good Peruvian ceviche, too, but frankly we are not 100% in love with Eche Pa'echarle's ceviche. Although it isn't bad in a pinch."}
{"text":"Solid Peruvian food place, my go-to when I'm hungover and need \"leche de tigre\". Great place and their seafood is as close as it gets in Montreal to the real deal back home!"}
{"text":"Had the Ceviche Camaron (shrimp) and the first beef and vegetables meat dish on the menu that the server recommended. Ceviche was decent but mostly onions and small for $25, and the other dish was basically cold soggy fries and red peppers with a small number of very chewy and very small bits of beef. I ate two bites and left it, only earring the side of rice with the ceviche. They discounted the $16 dish by $6. Ended up being over $40. Never again."}
