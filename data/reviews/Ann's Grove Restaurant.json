{"text":"This is a hidden gem that needs to be visited by every foodie. Very comfortable setting, Anita (the manager) is awesome! Food is amazing and original. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is place is fantastic! I ordered the jerk chicken with rice and peas. The jerk chicken literally falls off the bone and melts in your mouth!!!! Also the coleslaw that comes with it is very satisfying and that is coming from someone who hates coleslaw. 5/5 will be back next time I'm in brampton"}
{"text":"Needed my Jerk Chicken/Oxtail Rice and Peas fix...got it! Both meats were nice and tender with appropriate seasoning without it being overly spicy. Order came very quickly and were well taken care of by the Manager, Anita. Seating is limited to roughly 15 to 20 people and we were at capacity when we were there but did not feel too crowded. Will certainly come here again."}
{"text":"Goat roti wrap was severely spicy. Wish I was warned or at least asked if I wanted spice. I love spice but I need to be in the mood. Really hard to eat when you work in an office and need to have a quick lunch. Now I need to wait for my next break to be able to get something else to eat, can't handle the spice right now."}
{"text":"I've only had the takeout here but it always has been on point. My favourite is the goat curry (in roti or rice and peas...you can't go wrong). They also have black pudding which is pretty hard to find around Toronto. Going back to the goat curry, it falls apart and it has so much flavour. The rice and peas with the potatoes are in harmony with the goat curry. I can honestly say that this place is always a treat for me as I live on the east end of the GTA and this is all the way out in the west."}
