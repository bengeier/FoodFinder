{"text":"This place is a major win. The place is very clean. The staff is very friendly. The cook came over to ask if all was well. I really recommend this place for some good pizza. I think the secret is in the sauce."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way out of town because of the great reviews, and the reviews were spot on!  Best pizza we've had outside of NYC. The chef asked us if we wanted extra sauce  and cracked pepper added while he was making the pizza,  which had a thick, crispy, yet light crust.  The calzone crust was also light, thin, and crisp, not thick and doughy. When he found out we had a long drive ahead of us,  he gave us a small loaf of Italian bread to snack on for the road. This rat pack themed little pizzarea is now on our list of must stop places when we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have tried many different pizza places around Vegas, but never one that I liked enough to say I want to keep coming back. After reading the yelp reviews, I decided to check this place out. They truly met my expectations. I love my pizza thick and this place had that. I tried the pizza, calzone, and wings and they were all delicious. The prices are very affordable and there's even a 20% yelp discount for first time customers. The place itself is very nice, clean, and modern. The staff was very friendly and the chef went around to ask how our food was. I really enjoyed my experience, and I will definitely keep coming back. Best pizza place in town!"}
{"text":"Things I loved: The wings!!! Cooked to perfection and drowning in sauce. The pizza!! Delicious thick crust and loaded with sauce. Might be a turn off for sauce haters, but not for me. Clean and amazing customer service!  The only thing I would suggest is making fresh breadsticks and I say this with respect. Overall great pizza, prices and friendly staff. I will definitely being coming back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of Las Vegas! Seriously, if you love pizza, come here. Their pizza is amazing and hearty, and their calzones are busting with flavor. I had the meat lovers calzone, and it was probably one of the best I've had.   Staff is friendly, place is clean, price is great, food is delicious, what more could you want ? You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just left. Place was awesome. Pizza was delicious and the dough was amazing. Baked wings were very good. The place was extremely clean and the staff was awesome. The owner saw we had my 18 month old with us and offered to cut some smaller pieces for her to eat which was very nice. My kid is an extremely picky eater and ate over a slice. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is THEBOMBDOTCOM. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. Best in North Las Vegas  I promise you will fall in love with the calzones"}
{"text":"Very good pizza, great friendly staff  On top of everything , making sure we had everything we needed.  3rd time here and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food and customer service. The pizza and wings were on my list if things to try and I was not disappointed. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Very good food, nice people work here. We recommend it!  We have traveled a lot!  Very good bread on calzone and my pizza."}
{"text":"We were passing thru from Utah to fly out of Las Vegas (back to Minneapolis) and looked for the best pizza place along the way. The quality of both the pizza and meatball sandwhich far exceeded our expectations. Don't be discouraged by the strip mall location, it is fresh, clean, nicely decorated and there are plenty of tables to eat in. The Philly Cheesesteak Pizza was very cheesy with a white sauce, lots of steak and veggies and the crust was thick and flavorful. The small and the personal size pizzas were both larger than expected. The meatball sandwich had 3 large meatballs, sauce, cheese, peppers and onions - all toppings were plentiful. We recommend this north Las Vegas spot for a steal of a lunch with friendly service and great food!"}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would! FOOD IS AMAZING! I also want to thank the owner Glenn for all his help when Uber messed up my order. It is greatly appreciated!  Will defiantly order from here again!"}
{"text":"Really nice place . Stands out in this area! Clean , great food reasonable prices. It was a little busy but worth the wait ! I'll definitely  be back !!!"}
{"text":"Well done pizza. First ever Hawaiian Punch pizza, highly recommended. Special thanks to the owner for staying open for a few hungry folks after work."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and wonderful service.  Very friendly owners.  Ask about the kids coloring competition!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Service was excellent and very clean establishment! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place!  I ordered pick-up and it was ready within 10 minutes. I got the meat lovers Calzone and some wings, which (on the phone I was told) would come with 2 breadsticks (or maybe garlic sticks?).  The Calzone was a good size and it hit the spot for me.  However wen I opened the wings the breadsticks were not included, I was a little disappointed on that.  The lady working the counter was very nice, and I think it was either the owner or manager who was also there, was very friendly as well.  It would be helpful to have a bit more information out there (apparently you can get your Calzone made special?) but over all looks like a great little new place,and very affordable!"}
{"text":"We *really* wanted to love this place as the service was so pleasant and friendly, but the meatball sub and meat lovers pizza were just below par.  We all ate a single piece of pizza at the restaurant, which is very rare for this group!  We then tried it the next day, and I am sad to say, that it was even worse - basically inedible for me."}
{"text":"It is now a totally new pizza joint called pizzalicious. I have never been to red moon pizzeria and was so excited to try it. Already placed my order over the phone though so I just went ahead and paid. owner is very nice"}
{"text":"Came for a quick lunch and it's clean , nice and lols great.  The pizza looks amazing and the calzone was terrific. WILL be coming back most defiantly"}
{"text":"This place had very delicious pizza, perfectly cooked with warm toasted cheese. The service was great, the chef asked us how much sauce we wanted to make sure it was cooked the way we preferred. Very friendly and welcoming. They even gave us free bread and marinara sauce! One of the best pizza places that I've been to! Would absolutely recommend"}
{"text":"The cheese pizza was really good definitely will be going back. The new owner is super excited about reopening, seemed like a really nice guy who really cares about the quality of the food he's serving."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza! Enjoyed the flavor, freshness, and friendly atmosphere. Best wishes to Glenn with his fabulous new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Best meatball sandwich ever. I have had some good meatball sandwiches but nothing like Red Moon. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"This pizza place is not too far from our house and we were definitely pleasantly surprised with the quality of the pizza here!  The only reason I give it four instead of five stars is because I would have liked to see some more toppings on the pizza. (We ordered a pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese pizza) next time I think we will ask for extra pepperoni and sausage as well  The sauce is amazing! It is a thick hearty sauce.  The other reviews about the crust were on point! The crust was fluffy without being greasy.  We also ordered some mild wings and felt those were a great value. We ordered the mild sauce and really enjoyed it.  We will definitely be returning! What a great hidden gem on the north side of town!"}
{"text":"Great pizza at a good price. Friendly staff and a really nice environment. Will be back again. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great find! Delicious meatball sub and salad! Clean. Neat. Right price and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great place! The atmosphere is very pleasant and the food is delicious. Thank you, Glenn, for creating such a great spot for our community."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my pizza. I ordered a meat lovers and a combination pizza. The slices were huge and the toppings were plentiful. The prices are great for the amount of pizza you get.    It was nice to also get a military discount for my order. Kudos to this new restaurant."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good and well priced. There was nothing special about the inside, but I almost always take pizza home anyway. My only con is they are a little sauce heavy and cheese light, but it still tastes great."}
{"text":"This is such super clean grate tasting pizza!  It's worth driving to, I drive 6 miles because I heard it was good!! I'd drive even 10 miles next time to come here!!  Thanks for a great pizza and clean environment!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza spot! We decided to give this place a try after reading multiple 5 star reviews. They definitely live up to their reviews. Great fresh pizza and amazing customer service.  Lots of toppings! We ordered a large veggie pizza and an order of the hot wings. Neither disappointed. We drove 30 mins from Centennial Hills and it was more than worth it. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Was not at all impressed by this placed,  the best part is the pizza is made fresh, would not recommend it not even if it's free at work,  I would rather have pizza hut wings and pizza and that's saying alot"}
{"text":"First time coming here and I was very impressed. The interior is very clean. I got 6 Large pizzas for a work function. All the pizzas were made exactly how I wanted them to be and they were very good. Beats Pizza Hut pizza by far. The two women at the front counter even helped carry out the pizzas to my car and offered me a drink while I waited for the pizzas to be finished. Great customer service. I'll be back when I'm in the area again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"They are so amazing the best I've had in years and their service is like nowhere for a pizza place"}
{"text":"pizza tasted like it was a day old! the sauce to cheese ratio was very off, way more sauce than cheese. the crust was thin and was almost cardboard-like and wings were very small; had little meat on them. they were drenched in sauce which was very good though."}
{"text":"This is a new pizza spot that has great service. Our calzone was really yummy & cheese pizza was great! The owner is very friendly and it was a great dinner experience for us! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have now been back several times and they have not disappointed. My whole family loves this place. When going alone I get the personal pizza which is very filling. The service is always wonderful and the restaurant is always clean.   The pizza is delicious and the atmosphere is great. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizzeria! The calzones are phenomenal, go the meat lovers and was delicious. The pizza was also delicious and the sauce was very very tasty and thick. Love this place and will def be back in the future."}
{"text":"It was late for dinner and we were starved. We found this little place and almost didn't stop. Don't let the outside fool you. This is a great little place for pizza. The people were super friendly and the pizza was awesome."}
{"text":"I came here with my family last Saturday and omg the pizza was awesome. I have been to many of the pizza shops in town and have never tasted anything like it in Las Vegas. It's definitely not your conventional pizza. My daughter hates crust but she ate all of hers. We were a party of 7 and we had a veggie and a cheese pizza. The pizzas were so filling that we still had half a pizza left over. The place is nice and clean and easy to spot from the street. My husband is pretty picky about food but he loved it as well. I didn't know what to expect when we walked it but it totally blew my expectations out of the water. I was still talking about how great the pizza was after we left lol. This restaurant is a bit far from my home but it is totally worth the drive. I hope the build one in my area."}
{"text":"Decided to drive over on a Saturday and see what they had to offer. Let me say this! This is the most upscale place in the neighborhood. Don't let the surroundings detour you. The inside looked very nice.  Didn't know what to order so the wife and I ordered a 8 inch pepperoni pizza and a build your own calzone.  Both were very tasteful and the calzone held its heat for the entire meal.  I'll give it another go when back in the neighborhood.  Happy eating folks"}
{"text":"I tried this pizza because I saw a lot of good reviews I was a little disappointed! It was good but the bread was a little chewy other than that the cheese and sauce was good."}
{"text":"The Pizza was amazing! Their sauce is really good. Not too salty but has a lot of flavor. The owner/chef asked if we wanted extra sauce. It was a good decision. We ended up taking a calzone to go as well. This place is amazing, definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"It was really good pizza! They were fast and had great lunch specials. They were very friendly and caring and they gave a military discount!"}
{"text":"Amazing, puts fast food pizza to shame, great staff and wait time isn't bad at all. The dough was incredible. No need to ask for extra cheese!"}
{"text":"Personal pepperoni pizza tasted good and was a good value. Had the wings as well and they were a little smaller than I'm used to but tasted good and were very crispy, $4.99 for 6 wings and a couple of garlic sticks seems high since they were so small.   Things to improve: 1) had to ask for rest of our meal as they cooked but didn't bring out the garlic sticks. 2) Gave my ranch to another party member who thought it came with the wings, it does not. 3) would have liked to see more choices for sauce with the wings beside just hot, and would prefer wings to be tossed in sauce before delivered. 4) considering all the unlimited topping pizza places popping up if you want several toppings this place gets pricey in comparison.   Physical location isn't great as the plaza has poor access (can only enter while heading south on Pecos) and not a lot of parking, some people parked in the 7-11 lot and came over.  Overall the people were friendly, the place was super clean, and service was quick. If you choose the right items you get a good meal at a good value. I would return again."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Vegas!!!  My husband and I moved to Vegas over a year ago and we have been look for a good home fresh pizza place and I'm excited to say we finally found it!  Their prices are great, everything is fresh and home made.  I recommend everyone in the Vegas area who is craving pizza come check this place out I promise you'll love it."}
{"text":"This was really good pizza! We received the flyer on our door today and decided to give it a try. The crust is perfect, the amount of toppings on the pizza was great. The sauce was also good although for me a little less would have been fine. The two gentlemen that were working were friendly and helpful. We will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"So yummy.... The pizza has an amazing crust with sauce that is so flavorful you'll crave it the next day. The restaurant is decorated well and so clean, my only wish is that I lived closer lol, but it's well worth the drive. We will be back, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place. I've been looking for delicious pizza since we moved back into town and this is it!  I randomly walked in because I had to feed a working crew of 6-7 men and what's better than pizza? Glenn, the owner, was great and attentive, and you can tell he really cares about his restaurant. The pizza is made to order and I actually got to see Glenn stretch out the dough and create the pizza.   The inside was clean and welcoming and so is the staff. This place is definitely a hidden gem. All my guys loved the pizza! I will definitely return with my family."}
{"text":"A great little place. I've been there a couple times and I've loved the pizza and the service very much. First time we went for a pepperoni and pinnapple which had very delicious marinara.  This time we went for the pepperoni and Canadian bacon which was as delicious. Will have to be back again soon. They do take calls for orders."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.com! All the pizzas are great AMD the calzones are on point. It hits the target.... My stomach, all the time. It is never a disappointment when it comes down to my pizza cravings. Love the atmosphere of the shop, especially the classic rock!"}
{"text":"I love me a good pizza place. This pizza place was delicious! Their pizza is made to order, which means they stretch out their dough and create your pizza after you order. We watched one of the guys create our pizza and the way he made it, you could tell he really cares. The way he placed the pepperoni, sauce, and cheese on the pizza it was scattered. Every bite I took of the pizza had a piece of something yummy on it. I like that the pizza wasn't super thick and it wasn't super thin. It had a good balance of dough and crust on the pizza. The crust stayed crunchy and the pizza never felt soggy. Even with my fiance's calzone, he stretched out the dough placed the different means in a section so that every time he had a bite of his calzone, he could taste everything. He had a meat lover calzone, the cool thing about that is you have the option of having a traditional calzone or you can get it smothered in sauce and cheese and have broiled for a little bit. It sounded delicious but we passed for that night. Their wings are pretty good too! They have really tasty seasoning on their wings that in my opinion you don't even need sauce if you don't want it, but usually I get the bbq wings,  The inside was nice and clean. The style and vibe of the restaurant seemed kind of retro to me. The red walls and silver tables and chairs made it really feel like pizzeria. This place is definitely a hidden gem. Oh, the pricing here is amazing! You can get a personal pizza and a drink for under $10 ! You can get feed 4-5 people under $30 and that is a really great deal and you are not missing out on quality or deliciousness coming here."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their calzones!! Definitely will keep coming back! The customer service is great as well. The owner is always so nice every time we come in."}
{"text":"Ordered a small pizza and wings for two of us! More than enough food! Fresh flavors from the dough to the sauce! Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Service here is the worst. Owner or manager is super rude. They messed up the order and when I called to complain the guy hung up on me. Told him I'd leave a bad review and he said, \"you think I'm scared?\" If you order from here you better hope my luck they get it right because if they don't they will just curse at you and hang up! Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"I tried red moon pizzeria after looking through a few late night spots to grab a quick bite to eat. Not only were their pizzas exceptional, the service I received was impeccable. It's hard to find a new business that exceeds expectations in both fields, but they've definitely sealed the deal for a new loyal customer."}
{"text":"Wow! I picked up my order, Large Pepperoni and Sausage with really delicious Gourmet style hot wings with blue cheese. This place place is pretty good and very reasonably priced. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Second time we've eaten Red Moon! I love that we can use Uber Eats to get our pizza. We tried the Philly cheesesteak pizza and it was amazing! The crust was the best part. Pepperoni pizza was delicious as always, same with the wings."}
{"text":"The meatball sub is great lunch deal for like five bucks. Tasty homemade bread and meatball with a nicely spiced sauce. This is an overall good deal in a modern cafe setting. Plus the bathroom is very clean. Will come back to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Location: Easy to find!  Interior: Gorgeous! Modern, super clean, and love the decor! Good amount of seating space too.  Pizza: So good! I haven't had pizza this good in so long.  I can't stop talking about the hand tossed crust, I think I'll have dreams about it hehe   Bonus: They toss the dough in front of you, it's so cool! You can see them put on all the ingredients on the pizza too!   Overall: The owner Glenn is so sweet, he made sure we had everything we needed. The wait time is what you would expect for pizza not long but remember it's getting made fresh! Oh and they had alkaline bottled water that was a plus! You can tell a lot about a business by the way they treat all the customers but especially kids. A couple of kids came in to order and the owner treated them with the same respect he did with us and I thought that was a wonderful thing to see. Lots of other businesses don't do this and I see it to be a great judge of character so let's support this business!"}
{"text":"Well this place is good we got the wings which were amazing. We also got 2 pizza they were also good and fresh hand tossed pizza's. We came from central cali and lets see we were not disappointed. The owner and worker were very nice."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. By far. Amazing flavor.   My wife wanted pizza tonight, and I told her I am not happy with the options in North Las Vegas. She found this place, and we tried it due to the reviews... and let me tell u, those reviews are spot on.  We had two large pizzas and a meatball sub. Delicious. Fresh toppings and delicious dough.   I would recommend this place to all. Our favorite pizza by far."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The service is always great.  The calzones and pizzas second to none."}
{"text":"Great service wings & pizza! Coming back for sure! Also salad was fresh and great dressing. Prices very reasonable and great lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way home to California from vacation because I was craving pizza and it had good scores. While this is not an area of Las Vegas that I would frequent, I would definitely co e back here again. The servings were huge and the staff very sweet. I got a Stromboli and my husband got a pizza and both were delicious. The crust is delicious! Worth a visit to the \"other side\" of Vegas."}
{"text":"I recently came here with a friend for lunch. After seeing the affordably priced lunch specials they have on the menu and being the true foodies we are, we ended up picking out 4 different lunch specials to share between the both us. Inside is clean and the staff is very friendly. Red Moon is near CSN and can get really busy at lunch time. They were packed when we walked in, but they kept the line moving smoothly and while seating was limited due to them being busy, we actually ended up scoring the best table right next to the clear partition where we could see the pizzas being made.   Lunch Specials are currently Mon-Fri 11am - 4pm and include a fountain drink.  Meatball Sub ($4.99 lunch special) - The meatball sub comes with cheese and bell peppers and onions are optional and no extra charge. The sub arrived open-faced. The bread which is made in house, was very good! The meatballs were crumbled instead of in balls which I don't mind and while there was good flavor, there just wasn't enough meat for the amount of bread.   Mushroom Pizza ($4.99 lunch special) - I really liked this. The crust was perfectly crisp on the very bottom yet fluffy on the top and I love that they use fresh mushrooms instead of canned. The sauce is very good and I'd for sure order this again.   White Pizza ($4.99 Lunch Special) - Cheese was not skimped on with this one! Again the crust was on point, but the one thing lacking was garlic. I noticed all the fresh and quality ingredients being used here at Red Moon, so I was really surprised to see a container of powdered garlic salt that they were using (though garlic wasn't on this pizza I just noticed the container) when fresh garlic is so affordable. This white pizza was very cheesy, delicious and worth ordering, but my friend and I both agreed it was missing garlic.    Combo Calzone ($4.99 Lunch Special) - This was very good. The dough tasted great and there was a good amount of cheese, sauce and toppings inside. This is definitely worth trying if you haven't yet and the lunch special price is more than fair for what you get.   The pizzas also come in medium and large size and they also have wings, salads and cold sandwiches on the menu."}
{"text":"I must say this place is very clean and the pizza is very delicious,thanks pizza moon.."}
{"text":"I like the pizza here. First time I came they were super busy so I ended up having to wait. They took care of me the second time I came and truly appreciate their service. Definitely will continue to have lunch here."}
{"text":"Good pizza, especially for it being take out. Im use to poorer quality ingredients when you get from like a dominoes or papa johns. Their crust was really delicious. Their breadsticks were just ok, wish it had more to it but I guess it's good that they focus more on the pizza. However, it's their customer service that warrants a 5 star. I'd most definitely go back."}
{"text":"This spot is close to home looking for new pizza options in lieu of the other places in the area... it's very clean and sanitary. .. we watched the ladies wash their hands in front of us and prepare our food ... the kids liked they were able to get crayons and color ... we will be back"}
{"text":"Grabbed a pizza in my way from Vegas to Monterey. The service is great and they make the pizzas fresh while you wait. The pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"Was the first customer in today on Tuesday sep. 12th 2017. Also, I drove all the way by stratosphere just to be able to try red moon pizzeria. First moment stepping into this establishment I notice the amazing clean atmosphere some nice oldies playing in this store. I automatically got greeted and was recommended a meat lovers calzone. Plus, it was hot and ready for me which was a plus. This place is worth the 30min drive!!! If you are a crust and sauce person this is the spot!!!!!! If your visiting Vegas you have to stop by red moon!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend Called and ordered our pizzas. First off, the girl that answered the phone seemed rude. Then she goes and say \"it'll be ready in like 20mins\" when we got there, we could clearly see one of our pizza not being made and one was already done. We waited another 20 mins for the 2nd pizza to be done. The cashier did not check us out. The cook had to cook the food, and check us out. We did leave him a $5 tip. When we got home 15 mins later, my pizza was cold, and my boyfriend had decently warm pizza. Overall the customer service and location is poor. The pizza was tasteless and dull. I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"I was looking for a local pizza place and found this on Yelp! Great choice. The crust is perfect and the pizza toppings are super fresh. All pizzas and calzone are made fresh to order. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Simply the best! A great dining experience with friendly customer service. Glenn, the owner, is delightful and pleasant as well."}
{"text":"This probably my fav pizza place on this side of town. Prices and specials are awesome! Wings are perfectly hot and the pizza is well done. No complains here. Bonus: customer service is on point. Great joint! Clean and well decorated."}
{"text":"This is possibly the best pizza in Las Vegas.  I took a group of friends here because I heard that there was a new pizza place near CSN turning out phenomenal pizzas.  We shared 3 medium pizzas among 8 people and only had a slice or 2 leftover. The medium pizzas were huge and really fairly priced for the size and quality of toppings.  We ordered 3 specialty pizzas. The Philly Cheese Steak, the Meat Lovers, & a White pizza. All of them were excellent. I know pizza can be a bit personal. Different people like different things. But, everyone in my party was raving about this pizza.  The crust was thick and chewy, but yet it wasn't doughy. It still had nice crunch. It was cooked perfectly.  The Meat Lovers was loaded with meat. LOADED. Salami, sausage, pepperoni, & hamburger. Again, you could really taste the high quality of the ingredients. A perfect ratio of meat to cheese as well. This was definitely the favorite of the ones we ordered.  The White Pizza was fantastic. The Alfredo sauce was super creamy and had great flavor. It arrived at our table bubbling with cheesy goodness!! Mozzarella. Romano. Ricotta. I would definitely order this one again, but I'm a cheese lover.  The Philly Cheese Steak. Another winner!! Thinly sliced steak. Grilled onion. Green peppers. Mushrooms. Lots of cheese and creamy Alfredo sauce. So good!  I'm looking forward to trying the Lasagna Pizza, The Hawaiian Punch (a standard Hawaiian with pepperoni & Jalapeño), & the Meatball Pizza...and the calzones.  I live no where near this place. I drove about 45 minutes across town to try this place out because I heard it was so good. I was NOT disappointed!! It was 100% worth the drive. In fact, 2 days later, we were still talking about how good it was. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised with this place. It's located a little bit down the street from Pecos and Craig in a strip mall next to a liquor store. The location is a bit questionable, so I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but actually was very pleased. The interior was very well decorated, simple yet modern. The staff was very friendly and you could tell it had that small business vibe to it.  As for the food I tried the salad and bread sticks while my coworker had the Italian sub sandwich. The salad was very good. The ingredients were all fresh and it was prepared on the spot. 5/5 I also really enjoyed the creamy Italian dressing. I thought the bread sticks were also very tasty. 4/5 I did wish they came with some marinara, but was easily able to dunk them with a bit of dressing. The sandwich my coworker got looked very good too. He said it tasted great.  I would definitely come back again soon. I'll have to give the pizza a try next time. They also deliver with UberEATs!"}
{"text":"Red moon is fantastic !   The pizza is the best I have ever had!   Amazing customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Italian sub, my buddy ordered a pizza with pepperoni & jalapeño. The sandwich was great, especially the roll, but the pizza (which I tried) was better. Cool place. I'll be back. Tomorrow."}
{"text":"Me and a couple friends were craving some good pizza tonight. So glad we found this place! Pizza is awesome. The service is incredible too. Super friendly staff that really made us feel welcome. We got a large pizza with half meat lovers and half Hawaiian. I'd recommend getting the meat lovers. Both were great but meat lovers was better. We also got the wings with BBQ sauce. I'd definitely get the wings again if I come back. They just opened a couple months ago, but overall really great spot!"}
{"text":"I was so pleasantly surprised by Red Moon. I order a white pizza to stick with my Veggie pescatarian thing and I was very impressed by the owner and his take of the white pizza with Alfredo Sauce with a little Ricotta cheese for my taste. The dough and cheese were just right with great flavor and conversation. Thos spot and the owner are the best pizza in part of the city if not the whole Valley. I can't wait to to try some of the meat pies in a few months.."}
{"text":"Very clean. Modern with a classic twist. The owner is a very sweet guy and all he wants is for his customers to be happy. The food was fresh out of the oven and tasted amazing. Best Pizza I have had since moving to the Valley."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in town!  It's literally \"two visits in three days\" level of good!"}
{"text":"Service is a little slow but the pizza wasn't greasy. They definitely take their time to make each pizza to perfection. The portion size was good for the price.  They are known for their calzones.  If your in the mood for oven baked pizza at an affordable price this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I'm not big on pizza so it's not really fair for me to even review a pizzeria. But I thought it was pretty tasty food. The only issue I had was that my food was cold. :(  But it tasted great!!!"}
{"text":"Ah! Maze! Balls!!!!!!! everything is hand made to perfection!! The wife and i had wings and Hawaiian Pizza... the dough is seasoned perfectly; the wings are baked and grilled and seasoned perfectly! It is literally a mom and pop shop, great atmosphere, friendly peeps and you can see the magic of the pizza making...  PS. if you ordered the calzones, ask for smothered; it is baked and smothered with cheese and their awesome homemade marinara!"}
{"text":"I work at Nellis and was looking for good pizza for our crew. Red Moon has really good reviews and is not far from the base. I showed up with a big order, 4 pizzas, 3 orders of wings and salad. They got right on it. Of course it took a bit of time but boy was it worth it! The guys went nuts over it. We had the Hawaiian, Meat Lovers, a Combo, and the Big Kahuna, a pizza with every topping on it. I chose the hot flavor of the wings. Every single thing got rave reviews, including the breadsticks that came with the wings and the salad. In fact instead of having to combine individual salads, they were nice enough to make one big salad in a tray for me.  I have to say this place is spotlessly clean! I love that! And the pizza is made right in front of you with hand tossed crust. And one last thing. I was offered coffee or water when it was apparent it would take a bit of time. As if that wasn't nice enough a group of teenagers came in right after me and because they had to wait for my order they were taken a complimentary order of breadsticks! The kids were very appreciative and I thought it was a classy move! I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The people serving at the front were very nice! My calzone was a little soggy by the time I got home but it was a long drive so I'm sure it would have been better fresh. :) Will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Red Moon but it won't be the last. Our group of 6 (3 adults obe teen and 2 babies) was well accommodated as we had to move some tables around. The staff was friendly and the gentleman making the pizzas came out and talk over the menu with us. The pizza was extremely filling and two mediums rendered about 8 slices leftover. Waiting for the pizza allowed us the opportunity to watch him toss the dough, which was a lot of fun. Overall, cheese was stretchy, toppinga were plentiful, and the staff was great. 10/10 Would pizza again."}
{"text":"Deep rich great pizza after a bite you can taste the quality it's the best. I recommend the pepperoni it's beef which is awesome. Overall great 5 start experience nice staff."}
{"text":"Great pizza and really nice owner. Will come back again for pizza. Freshly made for your liking!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Had the Cheese pizza and a custom specialty pizza. I was blown away! The dough/crust of the pizza was so good that my god daughter and I both ate our crusts (which never happens unless its stuffed crust lol). It was so clean inside and the decor was a nice touch. The staff was very friendly and kind. I definitely want to come back and try the Calzones. I drove clear cross town and wasnt disappointed. I am definitely coming back and recommending them to everyone I know. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time last week after reading reviews on Yelp. I was more than happy to have stopped here! I got the combo pizza and my bf got the meat lovers calzone. Both of them were amazing! The chef was super nice and even told us about the yelp offer for first time customers. He told us they are a new restaurant and I hope this is the beginning of a long term neighborhood establishment."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza that has a great sauce and topping ratio. Pizza is made hand tossed and everything can be seen from the dining room. This place is inviting and offers a classic NY style pizza spot with bright red and metal theming. There is pictures with iconic vegas themed displays. Also the price for a full size pie is 10.99.. crazy cheap prices for the level of quality. Couldn't be more happy as a first and not last time customer. The owners take pride in the work and the customer service is top notch. Try the wings, they are baked and contain a rub that is really really good. Also the meatballs are no joke and a meatball sub comes in at a whopping $2.49 .. unheard of in price!"}
{"text":"This is an update to my last review. This time I had a large sausage and pepperoni pizza. The pizza was really  good.  Just a few minor complaints. First, for the price, I would expect that there would be more toppings on the pizza. Secondly, if you are a cold pizza lover, this pizza is not good cold. Lastly, if you're going to reheat this pizza it should be done in the oven because the microwave makes it extremely chewy."}
{"text":"I love this place  it's super bomb and the staff are super nice! Super nice vibe ! I love it here"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had the pleasure of dinning here. The customer service  is impeccable and the restaurant is very clean.  I have a high respect for the owner as I watched him greet and acknowledge everyone  that entered the establishment.   Now the food is very good, if must add. My husband and I enjoyed  the Italian  hamburger  calzone with lots of toppings inside... Let me just say, we will return.    Thank you Glenn for the bread, I will be dipping it in some homemade  olive oil.  See you again soon!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was really good the wings were a little different they add sriracha to the wings but they were ok the owner was very very nice to us! Also very clean!"}
{"text":"The customer service was A1. The owner of the store hooked up my calzone. I told them I wanted a vegetable one and he made a suggestion as to what would be good and it turned out pretty great. (I didn't think jalapeños would be good, but it was)! I thought this place was cute and the food was at a good price too. Will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Delicious white pizza with pineapple and onions Glenn made it so delicious . Lala was so sweet & very polite Extremely clean and I love the name  Red Moon pizza"}
{"text":"I was parked outside 7-11 when I saw this pizzeria and I was hungry and instead of buying junk food from 7-11. I decided to walk-in and the place was really nice and clean and has WiFi. Owner Glen was making the pizza. I saw the menu and I tried the BAKED wings with garlic bread sticks( man they were so good) $4.99 and it was delicious. So I decided to order more lol!  Thank you for your Service."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Great prices. Super awesome guys selling really good food. Check it out and I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on Tuesday. Ordered a large pizza, wings with bread sticks, and the signature Meatball sandwich. The pizza was delicious. The crust was probably my favorite part, as the cheese melted into the bread. It was almost like stuff crust pizza. My boyfriend's favorite was the baked wings. He said that he could appreciate the time the owner took to make them per order. He said they were crispy and flavorful. We will return. Plus, the pricing was great!"}
