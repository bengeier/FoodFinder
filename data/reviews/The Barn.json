{"text":"Had dinner here last night with friends who are members. Wonderful atmosphere. Quiet and elegant.  Great  food and impeccable service. Coats are required for men.  Nice touch you don't see anymore. If you're invited by a member  - just do it.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't believe reviews of private membership establishments should be included in your reviews. I have lived in Aurora for almost sixty years and consider my few dining experiences at The Barn of Walden as very special as are the friends who provided me with those experiences, but, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone because all but an elite few must be excluded for they are not eligible to dine there. I am sincere in my compliments for The Barn but this is my opinion based upon my wonderful times there and my inability to return unless I have a \"special\" friend who \"belongs\". Thank you, Mrs. Bonnie Charvat"}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better. I have had the pleasure of dining here for over 20 years. In that time I've never once been disappointed. My personal favorite is the rack of lamb. You just can't go wrong. Not a member of club Walden? Spend the evening at the country inn to gain access to this memorable spot."}
{"text":"Amazing Crab Bisque & Sonoma Salad. We were there for lunch. It was crowded, but our waiter was prompt. Beautifully decorated for Christmas. A magical experience"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere the chef was very accommodating to vegetarian options.  The drinks were yummy.  We went for New Year's Eve and it was a fun night."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for our 3rd anniversary last night. I ordered the blue cheese crusted filet and when the food came I let the server know that my order was wrong (honest mistake). What was brought to the table was the sliced filet with mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes. The server took the food away and was back pretty fast with the \"right\" entree. The server brought me a plate of sliced meat with blue cheese melted on top. When I questioned the plate I realized the kitchen had taken my old wrong dish, rinsed it off and put blue cheese crumbles on top, instead of cooking me a new filet which was not supposed to be sliced (or rinsed). Absolutely disgusting! I urge anyone who enjoys a good meal to NEVER spend your money at this restaurant! The management was very understanding and attempted to rectify the issue but at that point I had completely lost my appetite."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, you'll not be able to dine at The Barn unless you're a member. But a dining membership is not out of reach for many people. If you ever have a chance to go, you'll have a wonderful club experience in a cozy quasi formal atmosphere (jackets required for men still). The menu is old school continental, they have a very good wine list, and the cocktails are VERY generous. So generous, I'd warn against ordering a double."}
{"text":"A fabulously intimate restaurant for Walden members.   If you're not a member find one to invite you!  This is an intimate experience with a lot of attention to detail.  The menu items vary from season to season but the chef is excellent.  He may be a little traditional French in his approach at times but the dishes are hard to beat.  If you want to pamper your date, yourself or anyone else take them to the Barn.    Coats are required for gentlemen.    Chris"}
{"text":"5 stars are not enough.  Elegant dining experience.  Cuisine is superb.  The crown jewel of Walden! Memorable!!"}
{"text":"Interesting interior, the food decidedly above par. The service was a little spotty that detracted from the experience somewhat but overall the food made up for it."}
