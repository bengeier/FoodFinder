{"text":"The restaurant is now open for dinners on Thursdays and Fridays and my husband and I decided to have a date night. Great choice! The atmosphere is very intimate and romantic, candles on the tables, and it's not crowded. The service is very friendly, they treat their customers as friends.  Now the food. It's so delicious! The menus is not very big and everything is cooked to perfection. My favourite is eggplant cigars. It's Linda's ( restaurant owner) signature dish and it is perfect. I know it's something I'll come back for over and over again. This place is truly a gem!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this bistro. Was in Vaughan, ON on business, and looking for a good caf√© with substantial gf options. This is it! I had the Gluten-Free waffle, which has a great texture and flavor. I also had an americano, which was well prepared. The staff and management are very friendly and professional. Prices are reasonable, although on the upper end for lunch. Free parking and wifi."}
{"text":"Brookelynn was featured in one of the first episodes of Restaurant Takeover.   The decor is clean and modern. The food is great. This place is a gem waiting to be discovered by more people. It's inside a small plaza on Keele just north of Rutherford, which is not a prime spot for the passerby-type traffic.  I was invited here to a private party, which this place apparently hosts a lot of. They are open every day 10 AM - 4 PM as a regular coffee shop and then in the evenings they offer their space to private events like birthdays and corporate functions.  Of the negatives, there is only one that I can think of: They are only open for lunch (ugh!). This makes more difficult to plan my visit here. But I guess that fits their business model and they generate enough revenue even in that short time span.  The positives are plenty:  - Free WiFi   - A full bar (I don't know if that is open during lunch hours, will try to verify that on my next visit)  - The food is FAN-TASTIC! Sandwiches are yummy (they bake their own bread here) and gluten-free guilt-free deserts are out of this world.  - Yes, I just said it, their deserts are gluten free AND taste amazing. My fav is the waffle. Usually not a big fan of that item, here I just couldn't have enough of it.  - The coffee is great too. I had an Americano and it was reach and had a lot of flavour.   - Large TVs in each end of the room that can be using for presentations and videos (at a private event) or otherwise playing some food shows.  All in all, I'd be a regular here if only this place a bit closer to my home. However, I am going to stretch out one of next lunch breaks to come here again.   So Brookelynn, keep that coffee hot and that waffle warm for me. I'll see yo soon!"}
