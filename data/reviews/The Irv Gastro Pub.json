{"text":"We stopped in here on Canada day because OMI, down the street was closed. We had wanted to try this place since it opened and were lured inside by their fish taco's on the display menu. We sat outside to their lovely patio.  We indeed ordered the Fish Taco's, pulled pork taco's AND the calamari salad because we were hungry.  The food was okay - but unfortunately there wasn't a lot of it - so we also left hungry and ended up at the Loblaws sushi counter to satisfy our initial craving and persistent hunger.  The portions are really small for what you pay. I expect more than one grilled calamari tube and a small heap of 'greens' when a salad is 15$   The fish taco's had the equivalent of one thumb size portion of fish. The Pulled pork taco's we slightly more generous.  Again the food was palatable, but not so amazing as to justify the portions vs. value.  Have a beer on their patio, but if you are hungry, and you don't want to go broke satiating your hunger, this might not be the place for you based on what we ordered."}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese of my life! I got the blt grilled cheese and it was so delicious! The fries are also awesome and you get a pail full so definitely go there hungry. I also had the winter ale from great lakes.. one of the rotating on tap beers they have and it was super good too. Just overall really great place and will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Came back again for brunch. Got the Nutella stack and wasn't disappointed at all.   Service again was great.   Another 5 stars. Will be back again soon"}
{"text":"I don't understand the good reviews about this place. I have gone here 4 times since they opened because they are just down the street. BUT every time small portions that leave me still hungry, or poor food. This time it was a piece of grisly meat they past off as flank steak. Absolute crap that I could not chew my way thru. $25. Don't waste your time. The price of the flank steak at both of the gastro pubs in my area is less and the food is way better. The owner must be a marketing genius to stay in business"}
{"text":"Looking for a legit patio with a romantic, relaxed atmosphere and comfy seating? The Irv's back patio offers the perfect summer evening getaway, especially as the gastropub boasts one of the most interesting and reasonably priced menus in Toronto's Cabbagetown. I have been to the pub about six times and am always fully impressed by the quality of the food and its presentation.  The back patio's wide wood benches, treetop canopy and large tables cultivate the perfect setting for enjoying a cool, refreshing drink. While The Irv's fenced-in side patio is not nearly as private, it still offers a nice atmosphere within which you can lean back and take in Cabbagetown's neighbourhood charm - a lovely brunch setting. Inside, contemporary upscale decor shows off the gastropub's high quality and unique vibe before you even look at the menu, which is a treat in itself. It's an all-around excellent place whether you're with friends or business clients and my go-to for a quick, filling lunch that's way more worth it than shopping down the street at the more overpriced foodshops.  For the adventurous, the Philly cheese steak spring rolls or the duck confit club are set to fit your fancy, and for those with classic taste, try any number of The Irv's poutines or Mom's mac & cheese for a satisfying meal you'll remember. The Irv also sticks by its 15-minute \"Express Lunch Menu\" guarantee, and the food is great, especially the feature chicken wrap with sweet potato fries I recently tried.   SATISFYING: Sweet Potato Fries - A bit on the salty side, but just perfectly so. The Sriracha aioli is a nice touch.  DELECTABLE: Ontario Roasted Beet & Kale Salad - Large enough for a light meal, this salad is a healthy choice with optimum flavour.   GOOD PORTIONS: The Ultimate Irv Burger - This giant burger is a great value. It's delicious, but you'd better slice it in half before biting in. With a big bucket of fries on the side, it's an excellent choice if you're really hungry.   The Irv's menu has remained generally the same since the pub opened, with a few changes here and there. I tried some amazing scallops there once that I sadly no longer see on the menu, but I do see a pear & gorgonzola flat bread that I am excited to try. The one time I went to The Irv for brunch, it was fantastic, but I can't remember what I had and for some reason the brunch menu isn't on the website (which is my only disappointment about this place)."}
{"text":"First things first....This location is kinda cursed.   I've been in the neighborhood for many years and have seen this location try, try and fail.  I am glad that the IRV is really making a go at it, as I think they have what it takes to last the long haul.  1.  Beer prices and selection...very reasonable.    Welly cans for FIVE bucks.  Yes Ma'am.  2.  Service is excellent.   Not pushy or overly in your face, but they know when you glass is empty.   As a long time bartender in the industry, I am very critical of this issue.   You can talk the talk, but we can smell each other being phony a mile away, and they don't do that here.  3.  Food...I can't comment TOO much on it, but the things I have had I really enjoyed.   The poutine was nice (could stand to be a bit bigger...im a bit of a sow when it comes to fries!) and the fish and chips were crisp and very well prepared.  My one suggestion:   It's a pub.   Get Nachos on the menu.   The waffle cone thing is cute, but c'mon....I wanna drink beer and stuff my face full of cheesy chips.  Best of luck to the Irv...I want it to stick around, as it's a needed change from the Parliament Street pretense and the chainy McPubbington."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, service is great. Feels like family. Great patio in the summertime. Definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were heading to the 2016 Edge CASBY Awards at the Phoenix so we stopped by The Irv for dinner. We started with the Charcuterie Board. I was disappointed that it was served with honey and jam instead of mustard...until I tried it. It was amazing! My wife had the Pecan Crusted Halibut. It was served with wild rice, fresh green beans and a very light dijon cream sauce. Cooked to perfection and very tasty(she couldn't finish so I cleaned her plate). I had the Flat Iron Steak and it was the best I've ever had! It came with a steak knife but I didn't touch it. You could cut the meat with a spoon. The bacon & cheddar mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious and the green beans were fresh and crunchy. The menu said that it was supposed to come with onion frites  but I was so happy with my plate that I wouldn't have changed a thing.  I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"The things I love about The Irv: Welcoming staff Great food, all made fresh and not frozen.  The beer on tap tastes great  Pommies on tap Good Whiskey selection.  Clean glasses Cute patio Friendly locals  Favourite dishes are: the wings, halibut tacos, spicy buffalo chicken sandwich, the fries"}
{"text":"Had a bite here yesterday. Really friendly staff, welcoming and warm atmosphere. Great selection of beers and the food was to die for!!! Huge servings . . Will be back"}
{"text":"Update: Wednesday night. Table of 5. Ordered a burger and a pint, as everyone did at our table. Waitress didn't clear table until after we had sat down, ordered beers and received beers. Ordered food and waited more than an hour at this point. Hungry and still waiting... I'm 2/2 on waiting more than an hour for food here. Only came because friends brought me here... Will veto this place strongly in any group discussions from now on.  Edit: waitress gave us a free beer to compensate the wait this second time, so I've bumped it up to 3 stars. Still, all I wanted was food in a reasonable amount of time..."}
{"text":"My favorite Cabbagetown eatery hands down. Great food. Amazing staff. Nothing beats sitting on the patio with an Irv draught, grilled cheese ( best ever!) and pail of frites. Definitely my summer hangout."}
{"text":"Went to the Irv a few weeks back to visit a friend and stayed for a drink and some food.    I wasn't too hungry so decided to order a few appetizers rather than a large meal so can sample a few more things.  If I was with a few more people, I would definitely get the sampler dish.    Ordered the corn dog, pretzel loaf and beef barley soup with a beer.  Have always liked corn dog so not really much to say other than that it's nice to see on a menu.  I got 3 small dogs on a stick with mustard and ketchup on the side with a bit of arugula to make it healthy :)    The pretzel roll was also nice.  Again not something I see on menus often.  Hot crispy on the outside and warm/soft in the middle.  Was nice on a chilly night.    Still feeling a bit peckish, I ordered the beef barley soup.  It was ok.  Not bad or anything but also nothing that particularly stands out.  I would probably pass on the soup and try the many other things on the menu.    I'd like to come back to try the other things on the menu.  So I would say 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Um, hello, $5 Caesars and mimosas at brunch?  YES PLEASE.  The friends I went with are much more knowledgeable about beer than I am and they were impressed with the tap selection--though it's small, it covers a lot of ground.  Food was great; I had the classic three egg breakfast with pulled pork and felt comfortably full when finished.  The pork was under-sauced (a friend had the pulled pork sandwich and reported the same) but quite tender and my eggs were perfectly cooked.  Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My son-in-law Matt hosted a birthday party for my daughter Nadia here last night.  They discovered this place while visiting Toronto a few months ago.  Nadia is from Toronto and likes to visit frequently to see family and friends.  Matt worked here for a few years and likes to touch base with friends he made at that time. Now that they have two children, Nadia likes to introduce my grandchildren to her favourite places she remembers visiting as a child. The restaurant has a semi-private back room, which although noisy, can handle 20 or more guests allowing some privacy for a party.  The owner greeted us all at the door. Street parking is available. Washrooms are located at the bottom of some steep stairs on the lower level. A small patio is off to one side of the restaurant allowing those wanting to eat outside a nice place to do it. We were greeted with platters of cheese, bread, fruit, chutney, shaved meat and popcorn and edamame bowls as starters. The selections were printed on a private birthday menu with my daughter's name on it, which was a nice touch. We were offered the choice of a half chicken or baked halibut dinner. Both were delicious. The appetizer was a wonderful mild curry soup. Staff were very attentive and gracious. Our drinks orders were taken and filled regularly according to our requests.  It was a wonderful night. I would return in heartbeat for another meal if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Burgers were good, I had the kobe and brisket burger and my friend had chicken burger, both were very good. In house made ketchup mustard and mayonnaise was a nice added touch. service was on point, atmosphere was welcoming. Prices were average.. It's a small place so if your traveling in large groups reservations would be ideal. (Not sure if they accept reservations) given the food service and atmosphere I would return in the future."}
{"text":"I love the Irv! In the summer, my partner and I often meet there after work for dinner and drinks on the patio. The space is cute, the servers are friendly, they have a great beer selection and the food is quite good. We don't go as often in the colder months, but we should make more of an effort. If we lived closer, we'd probably go once a week."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this place with the family. We were super impressed, and we'll definitely be coming back!  The menu offers a terrific selection of items. Of the several things we tried, everything was exceptional. The onion rings i had were light and crispy, and accompanied by a really tasty cheese and beer dip. I also thoroughly enjoyed the crusted chorizo and mozzarella appetizer my dad ordered. One of the best dishes i've had in a while!   The selection of drinks is very nice as well. The Irv offers up a  wide range of local beers, wines, and spirits. If you can't find one that interests you, you're doing something wrong!  Aside from the food, the atmosphere is really inviting and laid back. It's the perfect place to go grab a beer to watch the game at. The staff are all very friendly, and we didn't have any problems when it came to ordering food, waiting too long for something, etc. Chef is also very involved, and came up frequently to chat and say high to guests which was really nice.  Overall, it's a great joint, and once this awful winter ends, i bet it will be even better when their patio opens! Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch.  Pros: - Good food. - Patio.  Cons: - Insanely slow service. We waited for about an hour for our eggs to come (2 people). - Pretty pricey for the area.  There are several better brunch options in the neighborhood, probably not coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty little place with great service, live music and delicious food. The poutine was to die for. We also had the smoked duck sandwich that was soooo good!! Great wine selection too and our rosé was perfect. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been here almost every other day since it's opening on the first of the month and it has been nothing but amazing.  They only have 10 beers on tap, and three of them are rotating, including a cask beer. Their food is amazing and I've been slowly eating my way through their menu.   Awesome specials like $5 pints all day on Sundays - Yes, INCLUDING GUINNESS AND CASK!   I am so happy that this is in our hood now, I've lived in Cabbagetown for 22 years and  its so nice to have something to go to where the staff are friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Good people. Good beers. Commitment to fresh food and continuous improvement. Worth making it you'd local."}
{"text":"Had some drinks and a meal here. The fish and chips were good, had no trouble finishing them off. The place is small, a split up into two rooms, more of a cozy atmosphere. The decor is nothing special, and doesn't really add to the experience. Had some good drink specials when we were there. It's a good place for a drink with above average food for a place like that."}
{"text":"This is my regular in the Cabbagetown area. There are daily pint specials for $5 and a great menu that rotates in new favorites every couple months. The food is made from locally sourced farms and is better than most restaurants.  As much as I love the food, I love the staff even more. From the owners to the servers to the kitchen, everyone is welcoming and fun to bs with."}
{"text":"This place is great, a local favorite! Their food is always delicious. Locally sourced menu and great beers on tap. Try the cesars, they are incredible. Pommies cider on tap also. Friendly staff and comfortable atmosphere. Especially on the patio."}
{"text":"Great new spot - the owners are present and very welcoming.  We tried the steak and the veggie burger fresh and great seasoning.  Love the 80's music keep up the great work and we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Family run (brother and sister I believe). Dedicated to their dad Irv. Small restaurant with a small patio outside. Simple items from grilled cheese bites that you dip in homemade tomato soups. Or consider other sandwiches or more significant meaty meals. Try to sit outside as the ventilation inside allows for a greasy smell.  This place is always busy but they can usually accommodate you."}
{"text":"One of the best casual meals I've had in Toronto. I had the beef dip and my boyfriend had The Gord Stellick burger and both were exceptional. It's worth the upgrade for the onion rings. Our food took longer to come out than what we would have hoped. Before we could make mention of it, our server came to us and let us know our appetizer would be on the house due to the delay.   Overall a clean, casual atmosphere and great food."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood pub.  Really enjoyed sitting out in the garden.   Lovely bar food, huge portions. Ciders and beers were only 5 - specials for Sunday.   Defo recommend."}
{"text":"This is my first trip to Canada and my first time eating Poutine, let me just say that this place is awesome af, made from scratch food, great local beer selection, I highly recommend the Great Lakes Brewing Octopus Ready to Fight IPA, friendly bartender and my compliments to the chef wish I could give it 10 stars"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with friends and it went pretty well. The place was a little small but it did the work. They have multiple alcoholic beverages that are slightly more expensive than your milestones/jack astors. Tried the Irv Burger it was okay, just a little burnt. I managed to eat just half of it. My friends had better shots at their fish and chips, and steak. Staffs were friendly. We will definitely come back for the drinks!"}
{"text":"I have been here over a handful of times now so it's time to review. For me its a nice and convenient place to hit up after work. I have never had a bad experience. I went here a few times during the World Cup to have some food and beers with friends while we watched the game. The outdoor patio in the back in amazing, such a great place to hang out with friends! The food has always impressed me especially the fritters, the tacos, the sweet potato fries, the lobster mac n cheese sliders, and the mussels. I always love their selection of beers. It was great when they had the beer flights special so you can try four different ones. Overall a great atmosphere and a great place to get together with friends and share some food and drinks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Food was amazing! The place was great. Owners are a bunch of gems! Wish I could give 10 stars"}
{"text":"I work in film so we tend to shoot at ridiculous hours and only get an hour for \"lunch\", which could be at any point in the day or night. Me and my coworkers decided to go to this restaurant to try and treat ourselves, we were greeted by a waitress who looked overwhelmed, which of course I immediately sympathized with as I used to work in a restaurant myself. She took our drink and food orders and then managed to disappear for the next hour, no big deal other than we were in a rush to get back to work, I went up to the bar multiple times to ask about our drinks and food and see if I could just grab them to help our waitress out. The bartender was super nice and helpful, she immediately brought us our drinks and food. When we asked for our bill, the manager came over and personally apologized and comped our bill for us, although we of course didn't expect that at all. Everyone has unexpectedly busy nights and it's all about how you handle it and I thought the bartender and manager tonight really killed it and made us feel like this was not usually the case. I would definitely come here again, the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. It's a family run business and the staff make you feel like you're a part of that.  It's technically \"pub fare\", but an extremely elevated level which includes challah bread, perfect hollandaise, and locally sourced produce and meat. Amazing selection for meat lovers, but way more options for vegetarians than a standard pub.  For all of the superior food you get, you still walk out with quite a reasonable bill every time.  Amazing food, great atmosphere, and the best people in the business.u"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Came in for a burger at 3pm - nice group of patrons and a friendly barkeep"}
{"text":"Pretty great! Was in the neighborhood for a concert at the Phoenix and had a little time to kill so pulled up Google to see what was close by to grab a beer before the show... The Irv popped up... A 4 minute walk... Ok perfect. And perfect it pretty much was. The place was small but comfortable. The staff very welcoming we were greeted with smiles all around. Drinks came fast and we decided since we wouldn't be staying too long that we'd just try a couple of appetizers. Onion rings and a jalepeno/ bacon dip with nachos and bread... The onion rings arrived and were the size of donuts!!! Big rings of onion in the most delicious batter! The dip too was fantastic and the bread fresh and hot! Gotta say we will definitely be back. Great vibe."}
{"text":"Good, solid pub. I've been twice and had a good time both times. Food is good, and the beer selection is good. The service is friendly. I'd definitely come again, but I didn't find the experience amazing."}
{"text":"Great patio, nice atmosphere and pretty good food. The burgers are generally good but the fries are terrific.  There's a decent beer selection and they're reasonably priced, with $5 specials available."}
{"text":"My partner and I arrived at the Irv with the magical mix of high hopes, great moods and middling expectations that make for a truly delicious night. We wandered in from the street expecting nothing but cheap beer and acceptable burgers, but alas the Irv ultimately delivered a difficult to swallow mix of rapid, delicious and beer discounted expectation growth and followed by dry, slow disappointment.   When we arrived, the place was busy and pleasantly loud--- there was catchy, live music in the front bar, a packed patio with perfect weather and a booked solid back room from some sort of large party happening. Our server was funny, friendly and immediately pointed out great cheap drink specials. We snapped these up alongside a delicious goat cheese/chickpea fritter appetizer that set us up for a night of big joy and mild to moderate drunkenness.   But then, alas, we were forgotten by the staff. I think our waiter (and the kitchen) were overwhelmed by the big party, as a long stretch (a good 25 min) passed without service, food or refills. No biggie. Really. Our server showed up eventually and offered us a pitcher of beer on the house, and I was immediately back to high flying goat cheese joy.   In theory.  The free beer never came! I waited in cotton mouthed anguish for another 20 minutes (still no service) until a decent but somewhat dry half chicken (and my partner's similarly decent but dry Cobb salad) arrived to simply mock our empty beer glasses. The bill came brusquely and without commentary an hour later, no free beer, paid for beer or even water had arrived, and we left saddened and  full, but thirsty.   Such high hopes!"}
{"text":"Their buffalo chicken grilled cheese was legitimately one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. First off, the bread is from a local bakery called Absolute Bakery (on Parliament) and baked fresh every day. They use challah bread and it was an amazing choice for a grilled cheese.  The chicken was moist and tender on the inside with a satisfying crunchy exterior that really soaked in the buffalo flavours. The cheeses they used were top notch. Usually I find grilled cheeses to be too oily and heavy but this sandwich was neither (although it was a hefty sandwich). The large bucket of fries it came with were fresh and perfectly seasoned. Evidently a lot of care went into picking the right ingredients that pairs well.  I can see why this item is their most popular dish. It was the perfect brunch entree and really hit the spot after a night of drinking. You have to try it!  PS. They make their own buffalo sauce that is amazingggg."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday evening after looking up a place to grab a bite that was close to a concert the Mr and I were going to. I had never heard of The Irv before and am so glad we found this place!   We were seated immediately and brought menu's and had drink orders taken promptly. The selection of craft beers was pretty awesome and Amsterdam products were being featured that day-props for carrying Boneshaker!   We were only in the mood for some appetizers and decided on some onion rings and a jalapeño, bacon, cheddar dip. The orders were both very generous portions and served on wooden platters. Great presentation.   The dip came with tortilla chips and a small loaf of warm, fresh pretzel bread and was so tasty and cheesy.   The onion rings were probably the best I've had. Wide cut and perfectly thin and crispy batter. And probably about the size of my palm! They came with 3 different dipping sauces which were a beautiful accompaniment.   I would definately recommend this place and makes efforts to return in the near future."}
{"text":"Petite pub sympathique , une cuisine excellente, des Burger vraiment délicieux et pour les amoureux de hockey des matchs en direct à la TV le tout avec une petite mousse."}
{"text":"If you have the opportunity to meet Regan, the owner, you'll quickly understand why this should be a regular stop. Great food, beers and friendly staff combine to make the Irv a go-to place to enjoy a night out."}
{"text":"Great staff, great beer.  We made it in here accidentally, but we loved it! They have an excellent beers that change."}
{"text":"Turned up at 12 noon on a Sunday, which worked out very well for us. We dined on the Irv Burger (good) and the Stacked Grilled Cheese (great), and  managed to put away a few fantastic craft beers as well. In addition to the lovely food, the staff was friendly, the décor was nice, and the two patios were fantastic! We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"The food was so good that photos were forgotten.  My husband ordered a wheat ale beer and the halibut fish & chips.  The  wheat beer was super.  The fish was cooked perfectly with excellent tasting tarter sauce. I ordered a 9 oz charonnay, which was expensive at $15.  It was fine but maybe not worth the money.  For food, I had the mushroom grilled cheese with simple salad.  The mushrooms were varied and plentiful.  The salad greens were crisp and fresh.  They held the vinagarette until the last bit.  This place is pricey for a pub but worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food and Service from Regan! First timers and were treated like family! We'll be back thanks brother!!"}
{"text":"The prices are a little high but the food is awesome! They have a unique bar menu where they serve typical bar food made from scratch and presented in an original way.  For example their BBQ Sunday is a pint glass filled with pulled pork, macaroni, and fried onions (tastes better then it sounds.) An order of onion rings consists of 4 gigantic rings served on a wooden board. They also have $5 pints from various micro breweries. The place is clean and staff is friendly and competent."}
{"text":"I am usually a purest when it comes to pouting - fries, gravy and cheese curds. So I was a bit apprehensive to try something new. They had a pulled pork pouting and I desired to partake. It was friggin' incredible. It had the perfect balance of gravy to fries to curd ratio. I talked about it for days, weeks even."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch on a Thursday. Place was pretty quiet but the waitress was very warm and welcoming. She wasn't overbearing at all but still came to check on us periodically in case we needed anything as we were seated in the back room out of her view.  I ordered the Curry Lamb burger as per her suggestion and it was delicious! Well seasoned and juicy. It's a flavorful spiced curry flavor and not a heat/hot curry for those of you wary of spicy foods. The mango chutney's sweetness balanced the curry very well. I had the Caesar side and was told it was more a watery dressing. She wasn't wrong, but I like to try Caesar salads at different establishments. I probably won't order that again.  My boyfriend had the Buffalo Chicken Grilled cheese and he really enjoyed it. I couldn't stop stealing his fries. They were crispy and delicious.  We'd definitely come back again to try the other menu items. It was a tad early to start drinking for us but the bar specials looked great and alcohol was reasonable priced."}
{"text":"I went to the Irv for lunch on Friday with my husband. I ordered the chicken and waffles and they came at a very reasonable time. However when I bit into the waffle it had a chemical taste to it - not expected! The server even tasted the waffles from that batch and confirmed that it was not very good. Then I had one of the chickens and it tasted fine but when I cut into the second piece I was very disturbed. The chicken was was still bleeding and raw! Let's just say I wasn't in the mood to eat after that. But the server suggested I order something else. I ordered the kale and beet salad and I wasn't too impressed. The beets were overcooked and the raisins in the salad just didn't go with the whole thing.  The server was really apologetic and comped my meal which was a positive."}
{"text":"Searched for something on a Sunday night, final night in Toronto. This place came up in walking distance from our B&B. The owner is a sweetheart, you can see how much heart and soul he puts into this place. Lots of beer choices we had the wild mushroom and zucchini grilled cheeses. Really quite wonderful. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great beer, good service too. The servers are helpful and friendly. Haven't tried the food yet but it's a lovely little bar!"}
{"text":"To me, this place seemed like a hidden gem in the Cabbage-town neighbourhood.  I had a friend introduce me to this place for a meal after a swim session at the pool and I was surprised at what I found.  We arrived to a very bustling place and the small patio was packed with people already.  Not too shocked consider the mini second summer the city is experiencing.  We took a table in the back room instead and it was absolutely fine.  The protein for all the burgers here seem to be sourced from local farmers in the area.  So the prices are all to the left of $15 but under $20.  Of course if you want to have additional items to your burger such as bacon, pulled pork, cheese, a fried egg, wild mushrooms, etc then prepared to add a few more dollars for each.  I took a long look at the burger menu and decided on the el-chapo because a coffee crusted coca-cola bbq glazed burger just spoke to me.  When the burgers arrived at our table, they looked very delectable.  The burgers are tall and skinny but the patty had a nice thickness to it and it was slightly pink in the middle which is the advantage of sourcing and not freezing those patties.  The burger was very pleasant and I could taste a hint of that coffee crust which wasn't overwhelming.  The coca-cola bbq sauce was interesting but just give me that regular bbq sauce all the same.  The house side salad was a great compliment even though I was tempted to get the fries.  Staff and service was super friendly and attentive.  I could not have bee more impressed.  Looking forward to coming back another time when I'm in the hood."}
{"text":"New executive chef put in place over the last couple months, with a new menu containing a few of the old items but no pulled pork sandwich that I loved. Instead you get 2 pulled tacos for $11 which based on the images of their website is a questionable offer. In fact I'd say their app selection could use some improvement as they also got rid of their charcuterie plate which made great accompaniments to the beer flights available (edit: many months later, the charcuterie has returned to the menu) Despite these changes and room for improvement, I am still saying this place is worth 5 stars.  Their lamb burger was one of the best lamb burgers I've ever eaten. Quite often there is a risk of the meat being dry with ground lamb, but in this case is was juicy and delicious.  Their beer menu is constantly evolving and was much better than the last time I stopped in, but between all ales, pilsners, and lagers to choose from, I'm confident everyone would find something that tickles their fancy.  And to top it off, their patios (side patio for streetside action or back patio for what I'd consider a better and more \"garden\" vibe) are great."}
{"text":"I love this spot. I've been many times and it's always a great experience. It's clearly a spot for locals as the servers seem to know a lot of the customers. They're wings are one of my favorites in the city. Although I haven't tried them, their grill cheeses are always my girlfriend's go-to. They also have a great selection of local wine. Service is always great. It's always busy so make a reservation."}
{"text":"Went to The Irv on Sunday evening.  Had walked by numerous times but felt like giving it a try Sunday evening.  We were thrilled with everything.  The greeting was very warm and welcoming.  It was around 8:00 pm and was a bit slower due in part to the long weekend.  We were ushered out to the back patio by Sarah and were pleasantly surprised by how roomy and comfortable it was.  The haven't cheaper out on furniture, and the placement was very comfortable and sensible.     We ordered the pork belly salad as a starter.  It was beyond good.  The flavors,  texture,  and presentation was stellar.  For mains I had th Black and Blue Salad which is served with a delicious, done to order steak.  My partner had the Halibut Fish and Chips.  We thoroughly enjoyed the food.  It really was an exceptional dinning experience all around l  Great prices, great food, fantastic service.  Only recommendation for improvement would be to beef up the non - alcoholic beer selection.  There are too many good ones out there just to serve Becks.  Well done Irv.  We'll certainly be coming back for more."}
{"text":"We had a great meal at The Irv Gastro Pub this evening! We got there at 6pm, and the patio was already full and had a waitlist. We were hungry, so we decided to sit inside. It was a bit cool (please don't turn the AC down so much in the summer--that's a general pet peeve of mine), but the staff were super nice and seated us straight away.   My dad got the beer that was on offer for the day ($5 a pint) and I got a nice draught cider, both delicious and really hit the spot after we had run through Toronto all day. Dad ordered the Ceasar salad with chicken and I had the grilled cheese with havarti and blueberries--SO GOOD! I also swapped fries for sweet potato fries and they were great too!   Overall, 5 stars (but please change the AC setting...)!"}
{"text":"Decent beer selection and the food is reasonably priced. I find the menu is hit and miss with some items being pretty good, while others leave more to be desired. If you are with a group of friends and don't want to break the bank then this is your place. Otherwise there are other places nearby that do cost more but the food is better."}
{"text":"Went to this pub down the street from my apartment for the first time tonight.  Nice homey feel, friendly staff, and quiet atmosphere.  Had a Porter beer (Sunday sale $5.00 pints) and Granny's Cottage pie.  Food was great, tasty and very filling.   I will go back again."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night for some drinks and food with 6 others.  The drinks they had on tap were good, small selection but a few decent ones so was satisfied with that.  The service was mediocre as we initially sat down and were ready to order drinks and the server immediately left. When she came back, we ordered our drinks and she started to leave again but I was able to grab her attention as we wanted to order a couple of the appetizers. I felt very rushed but ordered wings and was going to inquire about a couple other items on the menu and my friend had a question but she took off again.  The wings were very bar-standard and for $13.00 was expecting more than 6 wings.  When we ordered our mains, the server wasn't very helpful when my friend asked \"what are the popular items,\" the response was \"everything\"...great, thanks.  The food reviews from the group was very meh and the portion sizes were a bit inconsistent. The Gnocchi was a smaller portion, the burger was standard...  My friend ordered the beef tacos and enjoyed them. The angus poutine got poor reviews all around.  If you like poutine and cheese you would probably have enjoyed it more than I did but overall there are better places out there."}
{"text":"I was here last night visiting some friends. Having to come here, I really enjoyed this place. The Curry Lamb Burger with the Sweet Potato Curry soup is a great combination. The onion rings were amazing. Its nice place in the middle of Old Cabbagetown."}
{"text":"Great small pub, eatery.. HORRIBLE stools though, they swing and aren't comfortable. Nice staff."}
{"text":"I'm always interested in new restaurants opening in this area.  Unfortunately this one wasn't that exciting.  I like the decor and the back patio looked awesome (though it was too cold to go out there when we went).  The food was only okay, and the menu was quite small.  I doubt I'll come back here for food, maybe a drink when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  Service is awesome. The server refilled my Coke without asking. Free refills   Food was delicious. I ordered the St. Lawrence market sandwich with hash browns. The sandwich was pretty good. The mustard sauce was a bit overwhelming and not too sweet, but the bacon was delicious. The hash browns had both sweet potatoes and regular potatoes. $12  Prices are reasonable.   The place is bigger than I thought. there's a whole area in the back and it can accommodate large parties.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The Irv is quickly becoming one of my favourite joints in the city, and I've only been here twice.  The first time I ended up coming here on a whim, after being unsatisfied with the local fare in the neighborhood and doing some research on Yelp.  I was surprised at the large amount of positive reviews The Irv had, so I decided to come here with a friend on a Thursday night for a pint and some pub food.  Their prices are higher than your average pub, but their extravagant menu items and very reasonably priced pints made us decide to stay.    I ended up ordering the Gord Stellick burger, made with ground chuck, bourbon bacon jam, beer crusted jalapeno, white cheddar, and whisky BBQ sauce.  Can that sound any better?  My friend ended up ordering the fish and chips.  The food took over an hour to arrive, and my friend and I were not happy about this since we were extremely hungry.  The waitress was very apologetic after we asked her about it, even covering our nachos and beer for the long wait.  It appears that they had an unusually busy night and some troubles with their kitchen staff, and the food took longer than usual.  The second time I came back here, they didn't have that problem and the service was very prompt.  Awesome family owned spot that I will most certainly be returning to very soon!"}
{"text":"Looking forward to their early 9:00am brunches on the weekend!! Hopefully an extended brunch time too? For those late night hangovers haha"}
{"text":"Always great food. Even better service. And the best little patio in Cabbagetown. When we moved to the area, the owner gave us free drinks to welcome us to the neighbourhood. A+ in all areas."}
{"text":"Good selection of burgers and always seems to be a drink special going on. Nice patio that fills out quickly when the weather is good!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection.  The grilled cheeses are creative and delicious.  The service is friendly.  Great spot for drinks and a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I just got into town and was looking for something comfortable, clean and open late on a Sunday so I  could have a beer and a bite to eat. I couldn't be happier. I only wish the Irv was in my home town.   The atmosphere was very friendly and for a Sunday the bar had a nice group of locals and some travelers. The irv burger was fantastic, filling and exactly what I was looking for. Five stars."}
{"text":"Visited on a weeknight for dinner. This place has two very nicely shaded and quiet patios. The interior of the restaurant looks very new and clean as well. Service was a bit slow but the waitress was nice. Bathrooms were very clean and had an assortment of hand creams, hairsprays which is always a nice touch.  Food was fantastic. I had the garden burger which had pesto, goat cheese and other grilled veggies. Very filling for no meat! The salad side was a bit plain. Others in my party had: Flatiron steak, fish and chips, and the blackened halibut and everyone enjoyed their food a lot. Sweet potato fries were also very good! Portion sizes were not too large which is always nice and the prices were very reasonable.   Would definitely come back here again for dinner, or to enjoy drinks on the patio."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuuummmmm!!!!  Service here is slow, like the reviews mention, but staff is friendly and the place is nice.   The food is well worth the wait with amazing sandwiches and yummy burgers. They even have homemade ketchup for the bucket of fries you get with your meal! The beef dip sandwich is amazing, with toasted buttery bread and slices of perfectly cooked beef and delicious beef gravy on the side. I'll definitely be coming back (and probably to order the same beef dip sandwich).   They have 5$ beer specials all week and then specials for food every day of the week as well! Mostly rotating local brews!"}
{"text":"Went here with my friends for the first time and we are not disappointed, the food is good I had a Steak with vegetables and I must say the veggies are my fave the sweet potatoes is a bonus :)   The staff are friendly. They have a variety of alcoholic beverages. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"All good here - fries are the best around - try the beet salad - amazing.  Service is fun and frienly and nice atmosphere - good selection on the menu"}
{"text":"We had lunch here; glad we did.  We were pretty tired after walking around Casa Loma and Allan Park and it's conservatory.  It was hot and we needed a good beer and good lunch. This is just the place.  Our server was very friendly and his beer recommendations were just right. We have grey hair, so were happy to see a group of young women getting the same good treatment.  We ordered the prime rib poutine.  This was our first venture with poutine; they did it just right.  Th gravy was good, the meat cooked just right, the curds were melting and the fries were cooked in good oil. We split this and loved it. We then split a lamb burger. It came with a curry aioli. It accompanied the lamb very well.  We had just the right experience, particularly since we just happened to walk in off the street.  It exceeded our expectations. I hope it does yours. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food and warm service.  Recommend the poutine and either the lobster or duck grilled cheese sammiches..."}
{"text":"After being wowed with the service and dinner menu, brunch today was a complete disaster. Eggs Benedict and home fires served cold! Portion of stacked pancakes was a complete joke!!! Ran over to The Scullery after to get a real breakfast."}
{"text":"Great service, good atmosphere ...awesome food. I had the Buffalo chicken grilled cheese and it was epic...one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Not the healthiest thing in the world, but I didn't care.  My wife had the halibut tacos...she loved them.  Great local beer selection too...we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The pricey ($14) Signature Cocktails were disappointing. Both the \"Manhattan Sam\" and \"The Fashionable Irv\" were strong, but not especially tasty. The \"Tito Santana\", on the other hand, was tasty but very weak.  Great sweet potato fries, though!"}
{"text":"The fish n chips are delicious.  Fish is nicely cut.  Their fries are not as crunchy as I would like them but their sweet potatoe fries are awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing. We went here out of convenience (our Airbnb was nearby) and holy crap is it good. I had the cinnamon blueberry old fashioned and bison burger. I think even the buns were made from scratch because it was so so fresh tasting. Their credit card processor was down so we had to go to the ATM. They took some drinks off our bill which was really appreciated."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to grab a bite before seeing a concert at the Phoenix. I didn't have high hopes especially when the one ok-looking place was closing it's doors just as we arrived. We decided to walk down the street and try our luck, and happily we landed upon The Irv.  It's a small place but it was packed and they had a guy playing guitar and singing which was a nice touch. There was a large patio but given how beautiful the weather was, it was full as expected. Luckily there was some seating in the back. The inside is really cute, this place isn't something I would expect in this area. Then again, I'm rarely downtown so what do I know! I wound up having the chickpea and goat cheese fritters, was supposed to come with carrots and coriander salad, but thankfully the coriander was swapped out for arugula which I had no beef with. They were DEE LISH. Sadly my only complaint is that I wish there were more!! Lightly crispy on the outside, the insides were not burning hot. Didn't taste greasy. Yum. My friend got the roasted beet and kale salad which was presented beautifully and she seemed to really enjoy it.  I'll have to keep this place in mind for future concerts...from the looks of these other reviews, I want to try the fish & chips!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time tonight and loved everything! Delicious drinks, amazing Poutine, friendly and personable staff and great vibe overall. Prices are totally decent and lots of value for money. A great spot for a fun and casual night out! Looking forward to trying out more menu items."}
{"text":"Good place to stop by for a drink, don't bother with the food! The food was mediocre at best! Wanted to give 2.5 stars but came on a buytopia deal so gave them a .5 for the deal! $25 for $50 so overall it was 50%off almost!  Ordered the chicken pesto sandwich with fries. The chicken was longular and over burnt chicken, wasn't panko crusted as indicated on the menu, more like breaded. It said homemade pesto, more like fr a jar, hardly tasted any pesto! The buffalo cheese was merely a big silver dollar slice smaller than the two slices of tomato it came with!? On the menu it said was served on a kaiser, but ended up with a brioche! Fries was also a little overdone, but maybe it's just my dish!  My friend had the prime rib sandwich which was also bland! Added $2 for the sweet potato curry coconut soup! He had to keep peppering and spicing it up! Very bland! Overall, doubt this place would last past summer! Although it had plenty of outdoor patio sitting!"}
{"text":"The owner is a really nice guy and he strives to give you the absolute best. He knows what he's doing! They make all sorts of their food in house - cheese curds, brioche, sauces etc...You are getting some serious TLC when you dine here. My fiance and I came later on a Friday night and had a nice, quiet patio all to ourselves. The music was wonderful (80s!!!)  I had an excellent Pinot Noir and my fiance enjoyed a beer from the rotating cask that had just been opened that day. We had fish and chips and a Prime Rib sandwich with poutine. I walked home in a food coma! It was incredible and I know I'll be back often. My poor wallet! But seriously, it's so nice to support a local place that clearly goes above and beyond."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, probably a good place to take a date if you're not depressingly single like me. I really liked the techno-jazz music in the background, and the modern yet comfortable furniture. It's modern and mostly metallic with stone, but with wood table tops and seats making it warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Casual family owned restaurant, with drink specials every night. Nice oldies music playing in the background with baseball up on the TV.  We ordered both the red and the blonde of the Great Lakes beers on special. Took some time to get our beers and order food. I ordered The Irv's signature duck burger which was pretty good, not dry, unique bun with brie. Couldn't really taste the cranberry aioli. I coupled it with fries, which were great. My bf had the fried chicken with Mac and cheese. It was very tasty, the chicken was crunchy and moist, and the mac'n'cheese was very creamy.  We were both stuffed and satisfied with our meals. The only downfall was it took about 32 minutes for them to bring out our food after ordering, otherwise enjoyed the experience.  They have a nice patio for when the weather is nice or if you don't mind bundling up."}
{"text":"Flew in for New Years and I wouldn't miss a chance to come back here!! Love this place."}
{"text":"The Pulled Pork Poutine was really good but not as good as the Fish and sweet potato fries. Quality service and quick even though it got a bit busy.   The waitress was nice and noticed that something was wrong with one of the meals we ordered and she took the charge off the bill. That wasn't needed but it shows they care and we greatly appreciated it. Great food at a good price... Go and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"*Update:  I am very appreciative of some new information I found out.  This place only cooks with FRESH, never FROZEN items! Portions are a tad small, but as I mentioned, it was quite delicious.    Definitely makes me want to return and give it another go!  ---  My first time at this place was for a work function. I had heard a lot about The Irv, but when I walked in I was seriously underwhelmed. The decor, space, environment wasn't actually all that great.  In terms of food, I thought the menu was quite nice. Just enough options, not overwhelming but I found the price point to be quite high. Regardless, I chose the fish and chips, and I'll admit, it was good - the servings were very, very small. It was enough for me, but it was the smallest portion of fish I've ever seen. It did taste very good.   However, I must say the presentation was very nice.   Ps: a coworker of mine went another time, and paid $18 for a grilled cheese with mushroom I believe. He said he enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I stopped at the Irv Gastro Pub to pick up a to go order so I could have food on my drive home back to Ohio. Jackie had just opened up the bar. She was setting up while I looked the menu over. I was going to get a burger but their brunch menu looked so appealing I decided to get the breakfast poutine as well as the regular poutine. I know it sounds redundant but we don't get poutine in Ohio so I kind of felt like it was a necessity. While the food was being prepared I looked around the bar. It was very clean and had a really cool vibe to it. I loved the wooden stools and everything about the place. I chatted with Jackie while I waited for the food. She was super nice and told me all about the place. There was an \"in memory of\" plate at a seat I asked about so she told me about Scotty, a former patron. During my drive back to Ohio I ate my breakfast poutine. It was advertised as the food to cure a hangover. The only thing that would have made it better would have been if I had a hangover. I haven't had the regular poutine yet because I was full from the breakfast poutine and my drive home is only 4 1/2 hours, but I imagine it's nothing less than impressive. The Irv is a fantastic place and with Toronto being only 4 1/2 hours away I plan to go there again. So to all you locals I recommend that you go in there and pay this place a visit. It's a great place with great food and great people. It's a place where they clearly respect their patrons, as evidenced by Scotty's permanent spot at the bar. And for those who don't know, Irv, the namesake, passed away from ALS. ALS is a horrible disease and if my supporting this establishment can even remotely support people with ALS then this place gets my vote. These folks are awesome people who do awesome things. I will support them anyway I can. I only wish I had found this place before the day I was leaving! Oh well. Reason #1 to come back! (Julie)"}
{"text":"This place is precious. The employees are so friendly and the vibe is great.   They always change up the menu and have great specials.  I've been here a few times but last time I got the tacos (every Tuesday they have a new taco special). Delicious."}
{"text":"Second time visiting IRV and won't be the last. Missed brunch the first time visited so has to go back for $5 cocktails.  Started off with some coffees with baileys, followed by Mimosas. I had the BLT and my boyfriend the French toast. All the food was lovely, services fast and friendly, cosy pub feel and they will change the channels for your sports preference. What more could you want?"}
