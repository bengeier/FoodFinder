{"text":"My girlfriend and I attempted to make this our regular place to eat and drink Monday nights. The special is 45¢ wings and $1.99 Yuengling drafts from 7-10. Wings are great, appetizers are great, beers are great. What KILLS this review is the service. I'm not sure if it is because my girlfriend and I are of the younger crowd (mid-twenties), or the people there are just that rude. But, every time we visited, the blonde bartender took AT LEAST ten minutes to greet us and another ten to get our drinks. To add onto all of this, some times you can't get a seat in the bar (the only place the beer and wings special applies) they allow HIGH SCHOOL KIDS to sit in the bar area and cause a ruckus. What a shame cause the food is great."}
{"text":"Why can't I vote no stars?  This place sucked.  I'm from NYC (don't hold that against me, I'm no snob but I do know food and service), but come here frequently to visit my parents in corraopolis.  Had dinner in the past at Rocckafellas and it was was marginal but fine.  Had dinner tonight and you must be kidding!  Service was horrendous, even though not that crowded.  When I complained mildly the manager Greg came over and managed to get our salad and bread (after almost 45 minutes still no real food).    But first the waitress gave us total attitude that I ratted her to the worthless manager who was ultimately unhelpful and unaccountable and never came back. Second when the entrees finally arrived, I had baked stuffed shrimp ($18+ prob highest on menu).  Now I admit it is my fault for not just ordering a burger or sandwich, but can't they try just a little.  For my $18+ I got 4 tiny shrimp (12's, 10's) with some lame crabmeat stuffing and a ton of butter.  Everyone at our table thought the meal sucked.  Pasta with sausage special had 4 slices of sausage in it.  This place will soon go out of business, as it should!  Unless fools just keep buying into this crap!  Really a shame that it used to be a good restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here and ordered the full slab of ribs and it was tender, tasty, just all around goodness. The crab soup was delicious and so was the fried zucchini."}
{"text":"Pleasant visit to Rockefellers the other night. The service tends to be better if you are seated at the tables in the bar but I have had decent service in the main dining area as well.  The service used to be hit or miss in the past. The food is decent.. but don't care for the wings.   I am a big wing lover and have ordered them several times and each time.. meh.   I don't care much for the fries.. they seem frozen and not fresh.. BUT I am a fan of their sandwiches! The sandwiches are pretty big - big enough to share.    The onion rings are delicious and a must have!  I think they are beer battered.. really the best I have ever had.  My favorite dish is the Cajun Chicken sandwich (Roasted Red Peppers, Provolone).   The prices are above average, which is why I don't visit more often.   Overall good restaurant.."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch place. Eating in the bar area is perfect because of all the TVs and the bartender provides quick service. Portions are huge. Club sandwich is terrific. Soups are homemade. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved it!  Had the calamari and it was amazing.  Between 2 of us I think it was gone in 5 minutes.   And then the wings.    Oh my the wings.    Those were amazing also.    Our server was great.   Right on top of things. Didn't have to ask for anything.   He had it all ready and there.  We are making this a regular place!  Also,  on Monday's, they have 45¢ wings and $2 beer.    Can't get better than that,  right?  :)"}
{"text":"Have been here several times .   I usually have their Italian Hoagie or the Ribs & Chicken .   Both are good choices.   If you go away Hungary it's your own fault."}
{"text":"1 star is being kind. Service was terrible, she stood there talking to other guests instead of taking care of the needs of our table. The zucchini same out over fried ad tasting like fish. The bread tasted and smelled like yeast. I ordered the Italian hoagie,  the bread on it as well came out harder than the wood on the table and the French fries also tasted like fish. I'm sick to my stomach after eating there. NEVER WILL I GO BACK TO THIS DUMP!"}
{"text":"I have been supporting this establishment since it opened years ago.  I love the service staff, and the food. I especially love sitting on the patio during the summer, relaxing, eating, talking with friends, and yes, smoking!  This is a privilege that they have that diners who eat OUT OF DOORS may smoke.  It was more crowded than usual tonight as they had a lot of indoor parties of people, so the patio was crowded.  I was being very conscientious about smoking, but there was a table next to us made up of about 6 rude people who were flapping their arms and making a big deal about me smoking.  I spoke to the our waitress who said that they were annoying, and it was outdoors (and allowed by the restaurant).  Honestly, my next cigarette I had no problems blowing their way.   I will always support this establishment, unless of course they ban smoking on the patio."}
{"text":"Brought my mom here (at her request) for her birthday. Maybe it was because her birthday happens to be on New Years Eve.. I don't know. But both food and service that night were really bad.   My boyfriend ordered steak and it was 90% gristle. I ordered shrimp scampi and pasta. Both shrimp and pasta were very, very overdone.   My mom's pork was literally just pork. Plain, unsauced, un-spiced pork tenderloin slices.   It must have been the poor waitress's first day because she didn't know the menu very well and was unable to answer substitution questions.   The only reason that I gave Rockefeller's Grill two stars instead of one is that I went there once before and had pretty good wings at their outdoor area overlooking the city. That was a decent experience. Maybe we just ordered off the wrong part of the menu. Still, in my opinion, there shouldn't BE a wrong part of the menu."}
{"text":"A Group of us stopped there on Sunday after a concert at Montour HS.  The service was excellent she was always coming back to check on us.  Everyone loved their food but I was disappointed in my Stuffed Eggplant, it was hard not cooked through and it wasn't really hot, flavor was ok but a little pricy. Sauce was good but it was scantly on the serving so the eggplant was under cooked and a very dry.  I didn't send it back since very one was eating and I didn't want to hold everyone up.  I wouldn't recommend it.... but everything else from hamburgers, blueberry salmon and the other dishes everyone enjoyed... Oh one more thing don't order the mash potatoes they are instant and taste like it."}
{"text":"The staff here is absolutely hands down amazing. The waitresses are so friendly and always smiling.   The food is good about 90% of the time.  Great portions and super filling!  My family frequents here for lunch and dinner.   We love the club sandwich. It has yet to disappoint!"}
{"text":"I love this place, never had a bad experience here. Food is always good and hot. Also have a good draft selection."}
{"text":"The food is always great, but the service is normally terrible. If you're okay with bad (and normally not even friendly) service, the food is consistently really good. Other than the wedding soup, I've liked everything I've ever ordered, but we don't go often, since we only get good service once in a blue moon. You get a lot of food without paying a lot and if you're not in a hurry, that can work."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch a little while back and questioned out loud to my husband why we had never eaten there before. The service was great. The waitress informed us that one of the dishes would take a little longer, despite being in their mid afternoon lull, but it was well worth the wait!  Prices are very reasonable. The menu looks wonderful. I'd love to go back and try a little of everything!"}
{"text":"Great location, plenty of parking, excellent decor - perfect for family - sports bar! I travel for wings and although their wings are not the best I have had all the other entities come together to put them over the top! Homemade dressing tells me someone takes pride in their food! Hats off!"}
{"text":"I have to say that the \"Hattie Special\" is absolutely incredibly delicious. To know what this is, you should just go and find Hattie who is the BEST SERVER and ask her and tip her well bc she's the best."}
{"text":"It's okay, my family comes here but it's really nothing special.  The menu is large and the portions are large, which usually makes me wonder with a big menu how much is just frozen. I wouldn't personally choose to come here, but my family does come from time to time.  It's very dark inside which I am not a fan of and the food is pretty much diner food."}
{"text":"Wow! is all I can say... This place sure does feed you. I would give it a 3.5 realistically. But you will leave here full, because they feed you a gargantuan amount of food, dont believe me... get the cal-zone- my lord I never knew you could put that much bread, cheese, meat, and vegetables in a package- It was really, truly glutinous  if we would have eaten it all.   I got the steak w/ zucchini planks, i believe my friend go the same thing. It was good experience, I definitely ate too much since I naturally don't know my limits... so I left in pain, but that doesn't mean you have to.   The location is off the beaten path in Kennedy township, to which I never go, but decided to make the trek after a coworker recommended it.   The inside was busy, a little rustic, and also catered to a more middle-aged crowd. Still, if I am super hungry I think I would come again.   Warning: the steak cal-zone is more  of an italian steak than a cheese steak, so dont be surprised. It is a lot better with hot sauce- AND is still great as leftovers."}
{"text":"I've been going to Rockefeller's since it opened.  I've always loved the food and had a great time catching up without fiends and family. Until the recent years. I get it, it is a local hang out, but the treatment my husband and I have received while visiting my parents the last few times, especially today is flat out awful and embarrasses me as a local. Today we went in to grab a quick bite.  All of the tables in the bar area were reserved.  That's fine, we decided to wait for a seat at the bar. They kindly let us sit at a reserved table while we waited. Not wanting to waste the waitresses time my husband went to the bar to get us drinks, while I sat back and watched things unfold.   The bar tender blatantly ignored him for no fewer than five minutes. What was she doing?  Chatting to an off duty co worker. Remember, I'm a local so while I've moved away and she didn't know me I knew exactly what was going on. Then when he asked for drinks she snapped that we needed to use the waitress. My husband stopped her from walking away and explained the situation. He ordered me water and then asked about the draft selection. She quite rudely directed him to read the signs. I was appalled. Not knowing I'd heard (heck everyone could hear) he came over to see me. At that point we decided to leave.   If you're a local, go here and enjoy. If not, good luck getting service at the bar. A table might work, but locals will still win."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good depending on what you get. I usually get the steak salad and it's great. The fries are nothing special though. The service is always good. Overall above average restaurant"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the Stuffed Eggplant Parmesan. Fresh salad and great bread! Husband had the English Baked Cod. Cooked to perfection. Great flavor."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time last week after moving to the area. It was great. I ordered a steak salad and it was huge. I even had leftovers.  My husband ordered the steak hoagie and he too had leftovers.  It was one of the largest I have seen. All in all, we cannot wait to return. I wish I knew our waitress' s name because she too was perfect!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Rockefeller's in a long time, but with giving up on dealing with getting into Pgh with the Fort Pitt Tunnels closed, this was an easy navigation out of there & across the McKee's Rocks Bridge.   I love fresh lemon to spray overtop of fried zucchini! Hand breaded & served with their pasta sauce & I asked for ranch as well.  I got the fried Buffalo Chix Salad & Katie had the Portabella Mushroom Salad. I'm not a fan of the 'shrooms, but Katie loved it, saying it reminded her of a salad she gets on vacation. My Buffalo Chix Salad was fab - the garlic toast is always appreciated to eat with the ruffage :) Portions are large & in charge.   4 stars simply because I do think the prices are a little steep for certain items - $16 for a Sampler Platter doesn't jive with me - but the food is quality & service today was great. I definitely recommend their homemade Wedding Soup that they have daily."}
{"text":"Casual food and excellent service. The provolone sticks, fried ravioli, and fried breaded zucchini are amazing! The Rockefellers hamburger is also very good, big and comes with very fresh French fries. The French fries are the breaded type, very yummy."}
{"text":"Wife & I had the lobster ravioli with shrimp, crab cakes & chocolate banana crème pie.  All were incredibly fantastic.  Great atmosphere and reasonable prices.  Our biggest regret is that we don't live closer so that we can come more often!!!"}
{"text":"It used to be 5 stars food is always good but the prices have gotten very high was there recently for dinner for 4 no appetizers and 3 beers $87.00 ."}
{"text":"John D. Rockefeller was a complex man. He was a philanthropist whose generosity helped wipe out hookworm and yellow fever to some. To others (like my subversive self) he was a greedy oil baron and monopolist who was instrumental in the creation of Corporate America and the rise of wealth inequality. According to the website, this bar 'n grill, hidden in a suburban shopping center, is named after him. Perhaps Zinn's Eats doesn't have the same ring to it.   Anyway, what you'll find upon strolling in is a huge bar with about a dozen televisions on and a roomy dining area. Rockefeller's rather spiffy, vast menu ranges from typical fried munchies, sandwiches, burgers, barbeque and salads to ritzier steak, seafood, and Italian options. Rockefeller's props up their barbeque fare, and being that I'm often in search of the ultimate ribs, I almost went with a half rack, but with my cash flow being a little tight until next Friday, Kay and I got clever.  Enter Rockefeller's dinosaur of a calzone. Hey even they tell ya it's \"enough for two,\" and it is. Only the insane gluttons among ye should tackle this goliath of dough unaided. It comes in several varieties, the one we chose being of the Italian persuasion, meaning its insides were comprised of that Holy Trinity of Italian meats; pepperoni, cappicola, and salami. Tomato sauce, onions, and either mozzarella or provolone cheese (I'm leaning towards mozzarella, but I didn't ask and am not 100% sure) round it out. The fresh dough is brushed with garlic butter just prior to service, making it an instant classic with an inaugural whiff, let alone chomp. Kay and I both swore there was beer involved either in the crust or the sauce since we tasted it throughout.   The flavors and juices gushed out as we attacked with our knives and forks, steamy, tangy, ample meats and sauce overwhelming our palates. A worthy beast, it was not defeated easily.  Our appetizer was downright offbeat. Someone got the idea to take softened red tortilla chips, fill them with peppers and ground beef, fold them over, and serve them with sour cream to dip them in. Mino Tacos are what Rockefeller's calls 'em, and I call 'em a rip snortin' kickstart of a starter. Maybe they'll become the next microwaveable sensation, ruling the frozen foods sections of supermarkets nationwide.   Desserts, like close to everything else Rockefeller's serves, are made in- house, there is a legion of them. Kay got the 7 Layer Cake, I got the Oreo Delight, and we traded off on 'em.   One of the extraordinarily moist cakes ever, The 7 Layer Cake is a luxurious chocolate batter cake with vanilla pudding as mortar and white frosting on stop. It is to make the case for milk as a beverage. Cold milk. Ice cold.   The Oreo Delight is a variation of a dessert I've had a number of times before, and this may be the best incarnation I've had to date.  It has the Oreo crust, the mousse-like interiors, the whipped cream. Its texture angelic, its flavor demonic, one could OD on the OD.  You see, restaurants can in fact make their own desserts and make a lot of them. Rockefeller's demonstrates that.   And get this, Amy, our hoot of a waitress and a damn good one at that, told us they were running short on them today. Imagine what they have when they're at full strength dessertwise.   Rockefeller's has been secretly kicking ass in McKees Rocks for 13 years now. Let the ass-kicking be a secret no longer. Guy Fieri, you must come here. I know I want to try those ribs next time. I need a rendezvous with BBQ."}
{"text":"I guess it is appropriate that this restaurant be named after the grandiose, Mr J.D. Rockefeller.  As if there is one thing I can say about the food here, especially the sandwiches, is impressive.  Atmosphere - A little sterile, a-la-new diner with oak accents in a clean, non threatening style.  This establishment is located in a new-ish strip mall with ample parking out front.      Service - Friendly and prompt.  The waiter made sure to run to the back for each calzone ordered, as this is a made to order item, ensuring all food arrived at the same time.  Tea refills were fast and efficient.  Food - One word...huge!  I know Pittsburgh is all about the large portions, but this place goes a little crazy with a few of the menu items (view pics...especially the \"Pittsburgh Style\"...see the fork on the plate for scale).  Based on a prior Yelp reviewer, Darren W, I ordered the Italian Calzone.  I am glad I did.  This massive 'Zone arrived to my table piping hot with all the good Italian meats I just can't find down here in Charlotte, NC.  It is definitely good for two people or one person, as in my case (I ate the other half on the drive back home).  I especially enjoyed the dough of the calzone.  It was light (as in not greasy) and slightly sweet in almost a pepperoni roll kind of way (another thing I can not get in Charlotte).    Overall - There is definitely excellent value here and the food is very tasty.  I hope to visit this place again just to see how good everything else is on their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Call me picky, but when I see a mouse running across the floor during winter, I know there's more than one of them in the place."}
