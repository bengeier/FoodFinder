{"text":"This was the greatest dinner for all of us. We started with Greek salad, the tenderest grilled octopus, grilled veggies, fried eggplants, grilled oyster mushrooms, taramasalata. For main we had red snapper and seabass. The place is comfortable and welcoming. The staff genuinely cares about their customers. The service is polished and efficient. For dessert we had a platter of the sweetest most refreshing ripe fruit. The noise level is low so we were able to talk."}
{"text":"So overpriced and lacking in any flavor.  I actually believe their dolmades are purchased pre-made because they taste and look identical to the dolmades I buy at the grocery store.  Without any alcohol and only a starter and two (tiny) entrees it was over $100.  Waste of money!"}
{"text":"I used to go fishing with my father when I was little.

That said, I'm not sure why they charge $28 a pound here for their rathe small fish. 
See the picture, they charged me 2 pounds for this fish. You do the math and it comes out to $56.00 for a fish that barely was enough as an appetizer, let alone a meal for two.

The starters were pretty bad, the fish dip was awful, the octopus was chewy, though the dolmas were great.

The fish itself was a sea bass, and they only marinated it with lemon, which seemed very plain and so I was scooping tons of yogurt cucumber sauce from the starter onto my plain fish.

Seriously, the meal for two NOT including tax came out to be around $100.

Yikes! Not worth it.

Though the fish was fresh."}
{"text":"Great location: near Guy Concordia metro.

The restaurant: Adorable, the wall and the decor make you feel you are in Greece. The huge problem was the restaurant was extremely cold. Some clients wore their jackets and shawls while they were eating. My feet were frozen.

The service: super friendly and amiable. Our main waiter helped me to take some pictures. He asked to send one as a postcard to him...

The food: Was good, but doesn't not exceed any expectations. We ordered the Molivos's platter(fried vegetables with tzatziki sauce), lamb chops, grilled porgy and chicken brochettes. The best was Molivos's platter. Wine was good... it was my favorite; Pinot Grigio. 

Price: way too pricey! 

Conclusion: there are far better Greek restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here and it was tremendous all for a great price.  Highly recommended, the lentil soup was authentic and the trout was fresh as out of the sea.  A must try!"}
{"text":"The Retsina wine was wonderful. It has such a unique flavor. Although I was at a Greek restaurant, I was in the mood for seafood. I guess I was missing New Orleans. I had the grilled shrimp.  It was good, but nothing that outstanding. The wait staff was very friendly."}
