{"text":"Worse than taco bell .
Passed by the place and looked at the menu thinking it looked great husband and I tried it tonight.  Made reservations  online as we went sure how busy they'd be.

Walked in to be ignored by front desk, and then a young girl asking us to donate to a charity while we are waiting to be acknowledged . We told them we made reservations but disregarded  what I had to say. The music was beyond loud as I had to yell to have a conversation.  
When one server asked if we has been helped we let them know we hadn't so quickly ordered the meatballs for an app after the server telling us how great they were
 40 minutes of waiting and we get word from a server that they would be out in 2 minutes.   As we watched the kitchen cooks mess around looking as though they were in no hurry to make your food.  10 minutes later meatballs came out and they were Luke warm on the outside cold on the inside. 
As they had a charity performance sing and dance while we patiently waited for our entree meal of the shared platter. 
15 minutes  later we watch the food fly out of the kitchen to all of the tables and we finally received  our platter.  The meat was dry, tasteless and Luke warm yet again. I thought street food was to be hot and full of flavor. 
 I had a virgin sangria which they were so polite to charge 10.00 I would hate to see how much one with alcohol  in it would be. 
As the server asked how our food was we were honest not enjoying the food and a awful wait. The server was nice enough to apologize, taking 30% off the bill. 
I just cannot accept  watching cooks dick around the kitchen while I wait so long for food, let alone 10.00 for juice and berries, and music blasted so loud that I have to yell to have a conversation."}
{"text":"We were a table of 2 and I witnessed the waitress serve a table of 2 and 3 ahead of us even though they ordered later than we did and sat down after us. Not only that, but drinks didn't come until 30 minutes later and the taco special took over an hour. There are better options out there. NEVER coming back."}
{"text":"I've been creeping Tropical on IG for a while now (don't pretend you don't do it too lol) and they always have such fun witty posts along with the daily specials they've always got going on (HH, brunch, etc) so we didn't hesitate to book dinner for a stagette we had. They had no problems handling our large group and they were very attentive. 

The food here is unreal!
I had the coconut breaded fish entree and yummmmmm
The salty sweet combo of the coconut crust on the fish was brought together with the yucca fries and spicy cilantro dressing on the salad. I had a bite of the cuban slider sandwich (roasted pulled pork, prosciutto and melted cheese) and the arroz con pollo and I was in food heaven. 

The last time, a GF and I shared the latin street style BBQ that consisted of sirloin steak, grilled chicken, chorizo, chicharron (pork belly) bites, potatoes and grilled plantains. That's right, two of us finished off this platter hahaha NO REGRETS! 

Oh, on weekends, it becomes a super fun dance club with either a DJ or live band so you're guaranteed to have a good time at Tropical for dinner, drinks and dancing!"}
{"text":"Noticed Tropical the other day while driving by and  so glad we came back to try it! We've tried other local Latin restaurants on 17th and this was way tastier by far! The drinks were delicious, the three kinds of tacos we had were sooooo tasty and they had fantastic music with World Cup soccer on tv. What more could you ask for! We'll definitely be coming back and can't wait to try everything else on the menu! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out Tropical since it was one of the newer Mexican restaurants on 17th avenue. Unfortunately it was quite the let down. I got there at 6pm with my family, there were 5 of us. There were about 8 staff on and not a single other table there when we arrived. I had a gift card and was told I couldn't use it on \"specials\" which to me was kind of ridiculous but I just ended up trying some other items, other than just the tacos. Their guacamole was ok. Maybe made from scratch maybe not. It was hard to tell. The waitress took over 20 minutes to bring our first drinks and then got all of our taco orders wrong. Again we were the only people there so it's not like she really had a reason to get these incorrectly, she also seemed to be writing our orders down as she took them so again pretty confusing. The dessert tasted like it came straight from a freezer, so all of my gift card ended up going towards food that was less than average and we had to pay for the tacos that were sub par by far in comparison to all the amazing Mexican restaurants on 17th alone let alone calgary. Although the food wasn't horrid, I definitely would not return as their are far too many other great options."}
{"text":"Went there again on Saturday night for a friends birthday - it is indeed the old Tropical Corner! 

Had a live band playing so cover was $10. Music was amazing, drink service was as efficient as possible considering all the people in there. It was packed. Love that the high ceiling kept it a little cooler and should help when you have your dancing shoes on in summer.

Didn't eat anything this time around but food service seemed to go quite late."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , awesome location being on 17th. Really trendy design, it's beautiful inside, fits the theme of being in a tropical place. 

Went on $2.50 Thursday taco night. We had 1 taco of each choice they had on the menu. The guacamole was a small portion for the chips they gave, and way too salty. The tacos didn't have a ton of flavour. 

Wouldn't recommend for the food, but great venue!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a bunch of food to chose from on their menu, and even on their happy hour menu! Taco tuesdays is the best day to go there. There tacos are TDF and they have tons of hot sauce to choose from!"}
{"text":"This was a very busy place. Great atmosphere with good latino music. The day we went they were decorating for someone's birthday so staff were dancing singing and enjoying. They have lot of choices for food and drinks. We got one of their mix platter with potatoes, beef , chicken , cassava. So we could taste most of it. Food was ok. This place is great for group gathering"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend, for a cute little spot for a late night bite to eat. which was perfect for a going away party that we were celebrating. 
The people are friendly the food specifically the taco were really good and the drinks are fun and creative. My only negative and maybe an inconvenience was is they ran out of food and I was told when I booked the reservation that they would serve food till 10 they stopped at nine and then their website and everywhere online says they're open till 1 AM and we got booted out at 11. 
This is very frustrating considering we wanted a late night event for a small group. This is the kind of place you would expect to go to not only to  enjoy food and cocktails but also the experience and I was left disappointed."}
{"text":"Great little hideaway on 17th ave - worth finding! Really great food for sharing - we had the shrimp, empanadas, and 2 other dishes.  All were excellent although a bit small, but very tasty.  And very reasonably priced.
My only complaint is that despite not being bust, service could have been a bit better.  Otherwise, highly recommend for a meal a bit unique."}
{"text":"Love this authentic little street food hideaway. The margarita was muy sweet so if you don't like that make sure to ask for no agave. Tasty little empanadas with delicious fire roasted salsa and homemade guac. This is the only place I know of in Calgary that serves arepas so try that little morsel out!"}
{"text":"Great ambience!!.. I went there to watch the hockey game, and the energy was excellent!... However, for a sport bar, they need more TV's ... They didn't have enough TV's and some people on my table had to turn back on the rest of the group to watch the game...mThe food was ok... Nothing really special: is just a bar food... Don't expect any gourmet or delicious food... The service was just ok... Very friendly, but very slow as well... The best thing they have is the music.. When the game finished, they started playing good music, and is a nice place to go dancing... The margaritas were really good; all other cocktails were just ok.. Unimpressive in my opinion... I wouldn't have any other drink, except the margarita that was really good... I would say, that I can go back only for margaritas and dancing..."}
{"text":"After patrolling 17th looking for something different, a friend and I decided on checking this place out. Looks like a cute little hole in the wall and offers authentic dishes made with fresh ingredients. The mojitos are to die for and the service was great!! I would definately give it another try to try more dishes."}
