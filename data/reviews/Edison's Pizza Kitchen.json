{"text":"Perfect greasy bar pizza. I've gone here a bunch of time, one of the few places in cle that has green olives as a topping."}
{"text":"As I live in Tremont, this place gets some good traffic from me. I love the beer selection, the casual feel and the giant super cheesy pizza you can pick up through their little side patio. The crowd is always mixed and dogs are welcomed. They have an interesting, but slightly worn-down patio out back for when the weather is nice. I also adore the Thomas Edison-themed interior with old patents and electrical equipment - quaint and cozy!"}
{"text":"I've had pizza on both sides of town, from Bay Village to Lyndhurst. I've had both Angelo's in Lakewood & Edison's in Tremont.  There's no comparison:  hands down, Edison's is really the best pizza in Cuyahoga County."}
{"text":"Wow.........Went to the side door on the inside of the bar there was a bell that said ring me but I didn't want to be rude so I waited a minute, they seemed busy so I ended up ringing the bell. Lady that took my order was cranky and kind of was looking at me as a burden for ordering two slices, I thought maybe they prefer full pizzas by the way she reacted or maybe this is like a Dicks last resort. Maybe she was sick of all the drunk hipsters I don't know. Poor service irritates me either way. She had me sign my receipt and handed me a small ticket then proceeded to go back to the kitchen. Me being the relatively logical person I am looked at the ticket and noticed there were numbers on it. Thought to myself, hmm they probably call your number when your order is up.So I sat by pizza window for a solid 15-20 minutes. One of the things I noticed is there was a girl sitting there who seemed like she had been waiting quite a bit as well. I keep seeing people go up to the window turning in there ticket but never heard numbers called.Went up to the counter and asked for status of slices she said \"we don't call the numbers, you're supposed to come back to window in 5 minutes\" I said \"mam I've been sitting here 20 minutes and we've made eye contact a few times, couldn't you just let me know\" she said I didn't take your order didn't the waitress tell you that?\"  At that point I grabbed the pizza and wondered how many other people this happens to. The girl that had been waiting forever also went up to get her order as she had the same dilemma. Sorry for being so stupid oh keeper of pizza.

Ok, so I got miscommunication and no apology but we've all had lousy service at least the pizza was great right? Wrong. The pizza is EXTREMELY greasy. There is normal level of grease to a pizza and I would place there's around 3-4 times that level. So I dabbed up the pizza slime with 4 napkins and took that first bite into extreme mediocrity. It's not bad, it's not good. It's pizza nothing,more nothing less. 

Edison's is very simple, it's open late, connected to a bar, and serves slices. There's not many ways to go wrong. One way is lousy communication, poor customer service and a slimy piece of grease as your feature.

So, in short, after quite a bit of hype I will write this Pizza place off as having an average product with poor communicative hags running the show."}
{"text":"I've lived in Tremont for 2 years and Edisons has always been my go to late night snack. The slices are perfect for a quick fix but the specialty pizzas are delicious as well! Chicken bacon ranch is the besssssst"}
{"text":"Decent pizza with real cheese and meat! Cooked to perfection with a crispy Parmesan crust . You can grab whole pies or  fast and convenient individual slices. 
My favorite foods are the toasted sub sandwiches on amazing cheese bread, and fresh toppings! The bacon is fantastic !!!! 


Overall $20 for a single toping  pizza is a little high, along with one oven and a high demand, the wait your food can take hours, with some questionable customer service."}
{"text":"Absolutely top notch. Great pizza for decent money. The quality and quantity of  the food is hard to compare"}
{"text":"After living in NYC for a while, I am by no means a pizza expert. However, in comparison to most pizzas I've had while in NYC, the one's I had and still have in Cleveland taste like the nasty ass pizza you got at your school cafeteria or the cafeteria at your place of employment (assuming its not delivery of course). HOWEVER, Edison's has saved my day. The pizza here is perfect for the Cleveland palate. It is zesty, sauce has fantastic flavor, the cheese is delicious, and the crust is soft and chewy. It's not a thin crust like a New York pie, but not a thick crust like Chicago. It's right in the middle like Cleveland is geographically. The wonderful people who run Edison's really  put a lot of care into their pizzas and everything else they make. You see it when they prepare the food right in front of you, and when you taste it at home or in the bar next door. After every pizza comes out of the oven they rub this oil mixture all around the crust, then sprinkle an Italian cheese mixture on top. that's what makes the pizza good to eat from beginning to end. Also, they are the only pizza joint I've known to ever introduce honey as a side dipping sauce. It's not my personal favorite but others love it and I can see how the flavors surprisingly go together in a weird but beautiful way. I respect that kind of innovation, for lack of a better word. All in all, this is a great pie. If you are from here, got to Edison's to have your mind blown. If you are from a pizza town like NYC and Chicago, come here to have a piece of home and a piece of Cleveland all in one.

One more thing, before I stopped eating meat I had their chicken wings, 3.5 stars to those. Very good for a pizza joint IMO. I have also had their cheesy garlic bread sticks, 3.5 stars to those. Finally, their eggplant parmesan hero sub is great too, 4 stars for sure."}
{"text":"yum yum in my tum tum!  pizza, wings...its all soooooo good! others feel the same because there is always a long wait! Anywhere from an hour to two hours on a friday/saturday night around dinner time! A little pricy, but I wouldnt spen my money on any other pizza! OMG it's soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Multiple people told me this was the best pizza in Cleveland.  I do not agree that this is the best pizza in town, but it is definitely the greasiest pizza in town. I have never had pizza so ridiculously greasy before in my life.  

Basically this is a great place to eat at 2AM after a night of drinking in tremont but is not the place to go for truly great pizza."}
{"text":"Best greasy pizza in the whole GD state of Ohio. Try the cookies on the counter too!"}
{"text":"Hole-in-the-wall pizza joint in Tremont... but those kinds of places are the best kind! I love this pizza. The pick-up building next to Edison's Pub barely has standing room for more than a couple of people, and you can't really see past the counter (which might be a red flag for the average germaphobe).

I'm a bit of a pizza traditionalist, and their cheese pizza is greasy, cheesy perfection. The Parmesan crust and the ratio of cheese to sauce is spot on (more cheese than sauce). The price is reasonable for the size of the pizza (thin, long slices). 

They're now open until 2:30 AM on Saturday nights.. I just wish more pizza places near The Flats delivered."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best pizza in Cleveland. I used to live right across the street, I so miss having those delicious pies right at my fingertips! I now live in Texas, and have yet to find anything even close. My favorite is the hot bacon and spinach pizza, which is topped with enough bacon to cause instant hypertension. However you can't go wrong with a slice of pepperoni (so crispy!). Don't forget to drizzle honey on top, an unexpected touch that takes it to the next level!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Cleveland I've ever had the privilege to masticate. Always worth the wait. Fresh ingredients, great crust, oh the feta pizza with white sauce is to die for! Don't let the price deter you, as I said before, best pizza ever. They also sell by the slice!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland. I've only had take out. Always cooked perfect and in a timely matter. They load on the toppings, so ask them to take it easy if you aren't into a ton if toppings. Go to this place."}
{"text":"I had pizza here for the first time about a week ago.  Soooo good.  I got pepperoni, bacon, and banana peppers.  The bacon was overdone and crumbled over the whole pizza, just like I would make it.  The pizza was seriously piled with the toppings.  I really wouldn't have cared what the crust was like, as long as it was edible, but it was actually pretty good.

I had a slice of plain pepperoni a few days later.  Not nearly as great but still good.

One suggestion: get some Ohio honey and portion it in 1 oz. cups.  There is nothing hipsters love more than local products, and you are missing out by serving little cups of gross mass-produced honey."}
{"text":"Awesome. Just awesome. If you're looking for delicate thin slices, this is not your place. If you want a pizza piled high with good greasy toppings, here you go! I ordered the Ranch pizza, but instead of chicken and bacon, got spinach, onions, red peppers, and fresh tomatoes. When I went to the window to pick it up (to go) the woman asked \"how'd you come up with this idea?\" I told another place used to make it for me. When I picked up the box, I was surprised how heavy it was. Got it home, cut a slice -- wow! Instead of just bits of spinach strewn about, there was a whole layer of it under the cheese! They did not skimp with toppings! This was a to ally different animal from the last place! I can only eat 1 piece at a time, it's so filling. Nice flavors, generous toppings, a great deal for under $20!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and side salad portion was huge. The bartender was very nice but once you go over to the pizza side the whole atmosphere changed. The younger lady taking our order was hesitant when we asked questions and gave us the wrong dressings for our salads. When I asked for the correct dressings the older lady was not too nice or accommodating. I went back up to her and asked for salt and pepper and she told me they didn't have any. No salt or pepper in a restaurant ? I would recommend this food for take out only."}
{"text":"Haven't had a problem with Edison's in terms of customer service...yet. First ever time ordering I was quoted 30 minutes, and was pretty much on point when I finally found a stupid parking place in shitty Tremont. 

Honey is weird, but, it works well. My order was accurate, and cooked correctly. By that I mean taking it out of the pan, and putting back in to cook more due to the toppings. Really love the garlicky tang of the sauce, and the sprinkle of Parmesan around the crust is always a nice touch.

The only issue, which is nice, is that there really isn't topping limits. Whatever you order in excess of 2 toppings is just piled on like its one topping each time. Usually it's the more toppings your order, the less other amount of each one. I ordered half pepperoni and mushroom, and the half was covered in pepperoni, and a shit load of mushrooms. This made it so most of the cheese wasn't melted, and the crust underneath a little doughy. I give them credit for putting the pizza back in more to account for this, but, you can't cook a pizza properly with all the shit on top and no way for the heat to penetrate all the layers. 

Sausage is amazing though. You don't see that style of sausage anywhere these days. I bet it the raw, pulled, style. As it should be. 

I'm a fan of Edison's so far."}
{"text":"This pizza is great.  My usually order is plain or pep, but the last time I switched it up and went with pep and bananna peppers.  This was a great order.  The pizza was packed from edge to center with pep like usual, and the bananna peppers were cooked, but still had their crunch.  The combination of the acidity from the peppers and the sweetness of the accompanying honey sauce was fantastic.  

Tried the wings this time as well.  Went with the Edison's buffaque (sp?).  They were ok.  The wing was cooked well, moist inside and crispy on the outside.  The sauce was missing something.  It had a vinegar base to it, but lacked a kick on the back end.

In general, this pizza is a must try if you're in the Tremont neighborhood (and the Tremont neighborhood is a must visit if you're in Cleveland).  I'd even say its worth a drive there only for the 'za and a few brewski's at the Pub next door."}
{"text":"I had a slice of Edison's pizza on my way to Flying Monkey to watch the Cav's game and then I got another slice on my way to the car after the game was over. 
Very good, solid pepperoni game. Amazing crust--maybe a little tiny bit too much Parmesan cheese dusting but that's just me :). REALLY GOOD RANCH TOO!! I love ranch."}
{"text":"Ok so that pizza is good. Duh. But those f-ing peanut butter chocolate chip cookies have some special kind of crack that I can't live without. I am going back to school to learn how to mainline that shit. Actually I don't need school, I'll just hang out around the Dollar General store that people get kidnapped from and stuff."}
{"text":"Don't let the number of good reviews fool you. The pizza is good but the service didn't exist. The place is a hazard, uncomfortable and lack atmosphere."}
{"text":"Greasy!!!  Not gourmet pizza but still good for a quick bite!  Always nice to grab a pie and sit on the back patio!  Plus dogs are welcome!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in the area.  However, it's not THAT great.  Which I guess says something about pizza in Cleveland...? or just Tremont?

It does satisfy my need for pizza, which comes about once or twice a week.  I seriously do need to have pizza every week.  I have tried a bunch of different places, including Pizza Pan (yikes, but at least they deliver!) and some other grossies.  

In my opinion, the best place other than Edison's is Big Guys.  As I mentioned in my review of that place, I have to give them another chance to see if I can give them another star because my experience with their pizza was that it was too heavy.

With Edison's, it's a pretty good balance.  It's greasy but not overly so.  Cheesy, but not so much cheese that it falls off the pizza before you can get it to your mouth.  I love the olive oil and parmesan on the crust.  Their pizzas are a very good value, in my opinion, and the salad wasn't bad, either.  My husband had either a stromboli or a calzone (sorry, can't remember) and he liked it a lot.  If Edison's delivered, it would get five stars for the sheer convenience of it.  

Bonus: at the Taste of Tremont, where I tasted Edison's for the first time, I think I got the best deal.  The line was quick, and for 3 bucks I got a huge slice which was pretty easy to carry around and munch.  Didn't have to worry about using a fork or about getting all gross from the sauce from BBQ ribs (sorry Fat Cats, you know I love you and those ribs, but not at a street fair)."}
{"text":"This pizza is grease city! And that's definitely OK if you've been drinking and are craving some late night food. Otherwise, this isn't really on my list of preferred pizzas. But, obviously, it does its job for the intoxicated. Be prepared for a crowd and a wait during peak drunk times, too!"}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for pizza since 2008 when I moved to Tremont and discovered one late night (early morning) that they sold slices of pizza. And the slices were huge and delicious. The pepperoni is plentiful and spicy and the cheese always feels like extra cheese. Their other pizzas have never disappointed nor have the subs. I don't live as close anymore but any time I'm in the neighborhood I have to stop for a slice."}
{"text":"Agree with other reviews about the 'attitude'.  Needs improvement.  There is an air of \"just tell me what you want, because this job is cumbersome\".  I ordered one pepperoni slice, and please note that you should probably allow slice of pizza to cool for about 11 minutes, before you attempt to take a bite.  That puppy was barking hot.  Anyway, crust was fluffy and airy, not crispy at all.  I enjoyed the 31 (yes 31) little baby slices of pepperoni which adorned the slice.  Sauce was totally sweeter then expected.  Average slice I guess.  Wouldn't go back though."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Ever!!! We have to call in several hours in advance if we want to order on the weekends but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a Connecticut Gal - home of New York Style and New Haven Style pizza - but after a long day of driving  this pizza hit the spot.

Not knowing anyplace in Cleveland to get pizza - Yelp definitely came to the rescue.

I agree with the other users - our pizza contained a perfect sauce/cheese/topping ratio. 

Not sure if what we ate would be considered \"Cleveland style\" but the dough was on the thicker side - sort of like Greek style.  However it was delicious.

I also ordered a small side salad.  It was delicious as well!  Usually when you order a side salad it only contains the bare essentials (iceberg, sad tomatoes and maybe a slice or 2 of onion).  This salad was not any of those things!  Mixed greens, several types of vegetables AND mozzarella - now that is what I call a salad!

I also read several reviews about the honey that is included and I agree - it's an odd combination but delicious when added.

Great find in Cleveland - I fell asleep very happy"}
{"text":"The pizza at Edison's is good...but damn, the wait times they quote are crazy.  I called at 6:45pm on a weeknight and was told a 1 hour wait before I could pick up my pizza.  Geez.  Always be prepared for a long wait time for this pizza whether you are calling for pickup or ordering next door at the bar."}
{"text":"my FAVORITE pizza for dinner and my favorite slices for late night bites. They are very nice in there, but you must go in understanding they will be with you when they can. If you are sitting in the bar next door they'll bring the slices over to you usually! Love all of their pizzas I've tried so far."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence with this one. Let me be clear, however, that I have never been on-site. I've had their food twice via Grubhub and have to summarize my findings based on that:

1) Their pepperoni pizza (I had some onion splashed on mine) is great! I mean in a, \"Hey, I'm kinda hungover and need some greasy food that tastes good\" kinda way. It's not authentic, it's not gourmet, it's not this, it's not that. It's greasy, good-tasting pizza. So if you are some kind of pizza hipster snob, keep your trap shut. There are plenty of Yelp reviews eluding to what it is. You have been \"warned\". :p

2) Their sandwiches are pretty good. They, again, aren't EXTREMELY good but they are good. If you're a food snob, you'll find something wrong with them. If you're hungry  and a sandwich has crossed your mind, there ya go.

3) The salads are lame. I won't go into the inner-workings of salads. Let's just say that they are ill-conceived and overpriced. 

Of the two orders, I've not received an order from Edison's via Grubhub any less than an hour late. I don't know who is to blame for this but I SUSPECT this is Edison's deal. Just a heads up."}
{"text":"Maybe THE best pizza in Cleveland... USED to come out of this kitchen... back before the owners of Edison's kicked out the stoners who ran the Next Door Deli by jacking the rent up on them.  The Next Door Deli guys didn't care about you, they cared about making fucking great pizza, and it didn't matter who you were, you were going to wait for them to bake it just right.  And that was that.

Sadly, Next Door Deli failed to flourish in the new location they tried to establish on Kennilworth, and now I can't get my favorite pizza anymore.  But I can still get pizza at Edison's, and it's almost as good.  Just... I'll always have a little grudge because of what went down with the previous occupants.  If the grudge ever wears off, I might give them another star.

What Edison's makes now is ALMOST as good, but somehow not the same.  If you never ate at Next Door when it was Next Door, probably you wouldn't care.  But let me tell you, if you had eaten there back when they were the best there was, you'd always care."}
{"text":"Went last evening to pick up a pizza with pepperoni, mushroom and green pepper.  I had heard great press about Edison's pizza kitchen.  Note: this place is separate from the bar and I noticed a few reviews that seemed to talk about the bar, patio, bartenders, etc.

This place is solely carry out.  In fact, does anyone know who the owners are?  Was it the middle aged couple working the place?  The man appeared more like a motorcycle repairman than a pizza maker.  However, that guy can make a killer pizza!

Yes, the pizza was amazingly good.  Our go-to place is Angelo's but I would have to say this place is in the same conversations for the best pizza in the area.  I'd honestly say that it is a matter of personal preference.

Every facet about it was exceptional.  Fantastic amount of toppings.  Probably far too much for some people.  The crust/dough was great - not too large, not too thin.  All the toppings were flavorful.  I thought the cheese blend was incredible.

For me personally, I liked this better than Angelo's - it was that good.

If you are hesitating to try it, go give it a try.  You may say it's not \"the best\" you ever had but I'm sure you will say it's very, very good pizza.

The worst thing - street parking in Tremont on a nice evening.  It took a little time finding a spot a couple of blocks away.

Also, others have commented on the grease remaining.  To me, there was certainly grease.  However, I did not find it excessive.  There were not standing puddles of it.  The plastic sheet was greasy but not the box.

Also, note the time.  They open at 4:00 pm.

Run, don't walk to get there.  It's that good!"}
{"text":"Solid late night pizza options.  Packed with toppings the greasy goodness is a heart attack waiting to happen, but you will be back for more late night pizza crazing satisfaction."}
{"text":"Edison's is a place I hate, yet love. The pizza and sandwiches are good a dive never had a bad meal. Unfortunately, the service is consistently slow. It should never take an more that a hour to get a cheese pizza. I wish they'd expand."}
{"text":"I know Angelo's recently won as the Best Pizza in the city, but to me Edisons has no match. Just great pizza there. Great area of Cleveland. Never can go wrong with a slice at Edisons!"}
{"text":"I do not normally write a review, but in this case I felt I needed to. The reason why you wonder????? It is because Edison's made my family and myself the best pizza we have ever had. We ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Oh my was it loaded with toppings and incredibly tasty. The pizza was devoured in a matter of minutes. We have tried pizza place after pizza place for years. I have to say if you haven't tried them you need to. It is worth the trip. I know we will be back soon. I hope you will feel the same way."}
{"text":"Omfg the pepperoni pizza from here is ah-mazing!  Beware it's super greasy and might hurt your tummy, but it's totally worth it!  Another thing I really liked was they give you packets of honey to put on top of your pizza.  Honey who does that?!  I do now!  Who would have thought honey would go good on pepperoni pizza?!  Ranch is gonna have some serious competition now!"}
{"text":"Good but pricey. Medium 8/cuts 3 toppings for $18.95. Vs my favorite place for over 40 yrs back home in Canton. Can get a large 15/cuts 4 toppings for $16.95. 7 more pieces, one more topping for $2 less! Pizza was tasty tho."}
{"text":"I have to be in the mood for pizza and last night I was. Went in and it was an hour wait, so went over to Edison's pub form a beer. May write a review for the pub but the only problem i had there was I either got the wrong beer or they did not clean the lines well. Anyway, back to the pizza. It was good, probably better than Angelo's but far below Vincenza's. Pricey, about 18 for a medium with feta and pepperoni. Eh, a good place and will most likely hit again sometime."}
{"text":"This place is....a yes. Its a no brainer, just GOOD. I like the pizza as well as Stromboli. Great for a late night food run after a night out. Quick effective service. Even when they're busy I've never had a problem. Don't ever change!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious pizza! With the BBQ chicken I do recommend getting double meat. The last time I was there I got the ricotta. I was hesitant to try it but it turned out to be delicious! And who doesn't love their crust...and with the honey! Yum!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes had a Large Pepperoni- Bacon pizza and there was literally 5 lbs. of bacon on it! Fancy pepperoni also, served with Honey to dip it in. Awesome drunk food."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! The pizza is worth the wait! Wish I lived closer, because the pizza is a family favorite. Also, the honey is such a fun and delicious touch. Can't help but order whenever in the area!"}
{"text":"Decided to have wine & pie ( lol pizza) with my cousin to end the summer. She's going back to Europe and I'll be in cleveland as the leaves changes colors & fall. :( 
 We were going to opt for Chinese takeout but we didn't want to wait for delivery or drive far lol. I had to ask myself with would a local Tremonter do on a Friday night.... ORDER EDISON'S !!!

The woman over the phone was very helpful and we ordered a medium pepperoni pizza. It came with two packets of honey and it was piping hot! You could smell the pizza at least 6 steps upon walking through the front door of the place. The guys working dough were cute and polite. Nice eye candy after a glass of wine or two lol. Normally you have to deal with pizza places skimping you on peppering but not here! You will get your $15 worth. We ate two slices a piece and passed out. My cousin called it a \"Perfect Pie\" & can't wait to come back from Europe for more!"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm giving this place 3 stars because I've had conflicting experiences. On more than 1 occasion I've gotten a 'slice' from Edison's and it has been decent. I definitely don't crave their slices, but in a pinch, they'll do. I'm an admitted 'pizza snob' from Chicago, so I take my pizza seriously! 

That being said, one night they were out of slices and we were forced to order a full pizza. I say 'forced' because my stomach put me in a headlock until I ordered one. Much to my surprise, Edison's full pizza is WAY better than their individual slices. It was more expensive, obviously, but if there are more than 2 of you in your group and you all want pizza, I'd suggest getting a whole one made to order.

I've also ordered a salad from there once and it was completely covered in shredded cheese and onions. Not really my taste, but if you love your salad drenched in cheese, then giddy-up!!"}
{"text":"Edison's pizza is the best pizza I've ever had. The pepperoni pizza is COVERED in pepperoni...you can barely see the cheese underneath and one slice is huge if you order by the slice. Do not forget to ask for honey packets and drizzle honey on top of the pizza (thank me later). It is greasy but who eats pizza trying to be healthy?? If you go late at night be prepared that there might be a wait because they are so popular. A slice of pepperoni is $4 and you will be full afterwards!"}
{"text":"Yes, I've stood waiting for well over an hour to get a pizza on multiple occasions. And yes, I've been alarmingly drunk on all of them. Edison's is worth a trip after the bars, for sure. But if you're ordering delivery or dinner? Meh. 

The pizza is average, at best. Big doughy crust, typical ingredients, sweet red sauce, and...honey. Don't get me wrong; it's solid drunk food. But if you're not looking for a slice or 5 after visiting some of Tremont's fine drinking establishments, you'll realize that you're paying a lot (and waiting a heck of a long time) for pizza that's only marginally better than the corporate delivery places. 

There are better quality (albeit also pricy and more bourgeois) options in Tremont, not to mention some solid no-frills joints just over in Ohio City. If prices weren't so high, there'd be another star for Edison's. But the quality of the ingredients doesn't match up to the price point and wait time."}
{"text":"After much sampling and careful consideration, I'm ready to announce that Edison's is my favorite pizza spot! Overall, they make a solid pizza, but what really sets them apart are the toppings. Some pizza places just seem to toss a handful of toppings on their pizza, but Edison's is the most generously topped pizza I've ever had! You pay a little more for that, but it's worth it to me to spend a little more dough (yep, went there) for such a tasty slice!

One complaint, which ALMOST caused me to chop off a star is the wait time. I've gone to Edison's when the place was almost empty, and still had an hour wait time. With the beer selection, darts, and pool table, that probably isn't a big issue... But if you have a growling stomach, and all you can smell is that delicious 'za, it can be a horrendously long hour!"}
{"text":"Ok, let me state that this was the first pizza I had since moving from Jersey. This is NOT good pizza. Horrible ingredients and service. The only reason they get one star is because that was the only option. Try Angie in Independence, Oh... That is a good pie!"}
{"text":"The pizza is fantastic, but the employees are very rude. The wait for a pizza is unbelievable at an approximate time of an hour & a half for a pizza. Still worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Perfect hole-in-the-wall pizza joint!  Delicious, huge, cheezy, meaty fat-boy slices.

Get your fat-boy on!!!"}
{"text":"I would say that I don't have much to add to the previous review except that I think the pizza is definitely better than \"meh.\" I live downtown and I drive to Tremont to get this pizza.  They also have pretty good subs. I would highly recommend the cheesy garlic bread too.  A good choice for a decent slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland. Hands down.
The crust was this and crunchy and the huge portions of yummy toppings. Wish it was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from Edison's.  Oh how I wish the pizza was better.  Don't get me wrong.  It's better than Domino's; and I like that they give you honey to as a dipping sauce.  I just wish they had a thin crust option.  I guess I'm a picky pizza person.   Yet to decide if I prefer Edison's or Big Guy's for pizza in Tremont.  Think I'm leaning towards Big Guys.  

Honestly, I apologize for the following, however it must be said.  Their  red sauce pizza tears my guts up.  I've learned to order white pizza instead which seems a more soothing alternative.  Otherwise I'm hightailing it to the restroom every hour at work the next day.  Some other locals I know have also experienced Edison's Revenge first hand and avoid it for that very reason.  I have noticed that no one else has mentioned Edison's Revenge in the reviews and I think this is might be because most of the reviewers are are not locals and haven't eaten there sober.  AKA they are out on the town in Tremont, ordering a pie after a long night of boozing, confusing their next day toilet escapades with those oh so familiar day after, side effects that leave us holding ourselves tightly after a late night of debauchery.  Au contraire people.  It's the pizza.  

I haven't determined if it's the ingredients in the red sauce turning my guts inside out or perhaps it's the \"kind\" folks handling the food.  No judgment passed, it's a clean shop.  I'm just saying the people that work there are feeling groovy and \"kind\".  You'd have to be to work in a 105 degree kitchen in the summertime.  Maybe also accounting for the long wait before being served.  Although it's more likely because they are Tremont's front running pizza place and backed up.  They're a hard working group.  Although this is likely responsible for the heavy handed, mesmerizing layers of toppings so methodically applied.   

The first few times I had it, I also thought it was the best tasting thing I'd ever eaten.  But what isn't when you're plastered and heading home at 2:30 AM?

I have an affinity for Edison's, for sure.  I don't hate the place by any means.  I actually kind of love it and the goofy stoners that work there.  It's local and it always helps me out in a bind.  Like on those occasions when the bars are closing and my whiskey guts have already been claimed by the toilet gods."}
{"text":"I like the pizza here but most the time I have it is when i'm listening to the blues bands on saturday nights.I will say Edison Pizza is some of the best I have ever had and will continue to have it.I just like walking in and saying can I get a \"SLICE\" because it comes out very hot and very good.I will say get a slice and go next door to the pub and order a sessions lager and you cant miss on that.Edison Pizza is a must have if your ever in Tremont"}
{"text":"The pizza here has always been the best  but the last time they told me they were backed up and we couldn't order a pizza for several hours (we were in the dining area). Instead they let us order slices which for some reason didn't seem as good as usual. Hoping next time is better."}
{"text":"Enjoying a nice quiet rainy Sunday afternoon and decided to grab some pizza and watch some golf. Edison's did not disappoint. 

I ordered a large pep and pineapple pizza. They certainly didn't skimp on the toppings and they were high quality as well.  As for the pizza itself it is traditional with a bit of Cleveland.  Sauce was mild (not sweet) and cheese is provolone. They use a parmesan on the crust. They provide packets of honey which I thought was a clever way of appeasing the purest and sweet tooths alike.

Nothing special really, just good quality pizza."}
{"text":"I love their pizza..LOVE...but I am now starting to realize what people are talking about in regards to their poor service. I didn't even go into Edison's to get shot down. It was all via phone call. I was in a hurry walking to my car and asked siri for the phone number to Edison's...not thinking there was a difference between the pub & pizza side. Apparently I got the pub phone number. I called, only to hear the phone ring and ring. I hung up and tried again...the phone rang and someone picked up the phone and hung up. I thought it was a mistake, so I called back again only to hear someone yell into the phone \"THIS IS NOT THE PIZZA SIDE!\" She quickly shouted the pizza side's phone number and hung up. 

Clearly they must get a lot of calls from people trying to order pizza so I can understand how someone would be frustrated but there is absolutely NO reason why you should yell at someone about it. How did she know I was ordering pizza? Maybe I could have been calling to ask what time the pub closes? 

I proceed to call the pizza side of Edison's. The person who answered also sounded ticked off and almost laughed when I said I wanted to pick up a pizza. \"Yeah you're ganna have to wait an hour or two.\" I said ok nevermind and they immediately hung up.

UGH why does their pizza have to be so damn good."}
{"text":"I've only had a slice soo far but it was the Greazious! Cheezious Bestest! Slice I've ever had!!! Looking forward to a whole pie.. Sorry Reddi's Pizzeria."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've tasted in Cleveland.  New York style is their game.  Everything I've ever eaten from this place has tantalized my taste buds.  The novelty of dipping your crust in honey is not only clever, but totally delicious.  If you have not tried this place, fix yourself.  :)

Keep up the good work you guys!  See you soon."}
{"text":"super greasy but was a good late night choice"}
{"text":"You know the feeling when you think you have it all figured out? 
You know exactly what you want and exactly where to get it. 
Prepare for your boundaries to be shattered. 
Introducing: Edison's Pizza Kitchen!! 
Hold your applause till the end, please. 
This is without a doubt the best pizza I have ever had. Ever. Period. 

Allow me to take you on a tour and tell you why. Picture: a small but unassuming place in the up and coming Tremont. This place seriously is tiny! There's just a counter and a whole bunch of ovens. Yes, there is Edison's Pub next door, but they are owned and operated independently. The gig is build your own pizza, but there are recommended specials. My go to is a traditional red sauce pizza with sausage, pepperoni's and mushrooms. This sounds pretty standard right? Wrong! The red sauce is spread evenly over thick buttered crust and covered with gooey melted cheese. A blanket of warm fragrant pepperoni's are nestled within the bed of mozzarella. On top of the pepperoni's are oversized mushrooms and sausage glued together with an extra helping of melt in your mouth cheese. These toppings are HUGE and in generous portions! I also can't get over how fresh all of the toppings are. It's as if the pepperoni and sausage are cured and the mushrooms are gathered that same morning! The pizza is worth the wait because there will be one. I usually try to call right when they open because your pizza will take 45 minutes to 1 hour to cook. This place gets busy! The line is easily out the door if you wait till prime time to order. I recommend calling ahead to avoid this. You'll also get honey packets with your pizza, which sounds weird, but I promise you should try it! I honestly never thought the two flavors would pair so harmoniously together, but they do. I didn't think this pizza was missing anything until I added honey. 

Is everything there awesome? I think so! The spicy bacon and spinach pizza is next on my list! I will admit that when I was trying to mix things up and was probably running on too much stress and too little sleep I ordered a red pizza with artichoke hearts and chicken....I do not recommend! That was my mistake of course. When you know what you're doing and you order what you like, Edison's will do no wrong. I highly recommend this establishment and will continue to be a loyal customer here as long as I live in Cleveland. Let me tell you folks, I'm from California and the west coast has nothing on this place! My only regret is that it took me living here for over a year until I found out about this place. Hurry over!"}
{"text":"My husband would give this place 5 stars if he was writing the review but I'm from NY and I'll always be partial to that style of pizza. Although I have to admit, for a place that's not in NY, it's decent. Decent crust, extra cheese really is a lot of cheese. And I find the little honey packets interesting, but I'd rather have my pizza stand alone and not need the extra bit to make it go from good to pretty good."}
{"text":"Been going here a bit recently. Pretty cool place. Rather laid back. Their beer selection is pretty on point and you can order pizza by the slice! Around $3. Good for friends and family, maybe not kids but worth a shot I suppose. Parking is always horrible so expect a small walk. Great for a date:)"}
{"text":"Lets get the bad out of the way first. I think the ordering system needs some work. Not really a system, just waiting around until they remember your order. Ok, no more negativity. The pizza is VERY good. I tried the cheese and pepperoni. For a late night slice, the pizza had a ton of flavor and a TON of slices of pepperonis. The attention to detail on each slice is represented. Also, an added bonus, this place is connected to a bar. Pizza and Booze, perfect combo."}
{"text":"We were in town for the NCAA games and decided to drop in based on the yelp reviews and we're glad we did. It's definitely nothing fancy but who wants fancy when you're dealing with beer and pizza??

We had a half pepperoni half cheese and it took a little while but it wasn't too bad. We snacked on the popcorn while we waited and they were really nice to our kids as well. When the pizza came out it was really good - tasty crust, gooey cheese and the pepperoni was thin and crispy but there was plenty of it!"}
{"text":"Good pizza but the staff is a kinda rude.   I don't think they care because they sell a lot of pizza.  It's fantastic with with honey on it but they charge you for the little packets - lame."}
{"text":"The bar is reminiscent of Cheers -- and for good reason -- it opened when that was still fashionable. Dark wood and low light are far from modern.

Edison's is not trendy. It's a fixture and it's a fixture for good reason. The pizza is excellent and the beer is cheap and unpretentious. It's everything you hoped a bar would be when you were younger and there's still nothing wrong with that formula today.

I usually call ahead even when I'm going to eat there as it is not uncommon to have a one hour wait for pizza. It's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"this is some bad food. i mean it's just the worst. it's so delicious and cheesy and greasy, and then several slices later you realize you have just eaten about a million calories. come here drunk so you don't have to think about that. or get drunk when you get here while you're waiting for your pizza.
we ordered a large of the pepperoni and a medium of the pesto with spinach. oh we also ordered some cheesy bread.
everything was hot, greasy, and delicious.
i wasn't big into the honey dipping thing bc i don't like sweets much.
the place is a huge grungy dive bar so if you're not into that and need high class sophistication.. try somewhere else. i mean i love dives but it was almost making me a little uncomfortable.
also, drinks are strong.
and free popcorn, which is also terrible.
in the end we barely made a dent in our pizzas so now i have more than half of this pesto spinach pizza in my fridge that i'm prob gonna freeze so i don't devour a million calories in the next day."}
{"text":"With so many pizza options, what's a girl to do? It takes a really long time to order a whole pie here and sometimes you just need a quick fix... that's why I come to Edison's for 'za by the slice.  The pepperoni is LOADED, greasy-good, and some of the best I've had.  A single slice is huge (and will only set you back $4). You can eat it in the pub or take it on the fly for a cheap and filling meal. Sorry, no more doggos allowed in the pub these days so leave your furry companions at home-- maybe even spare a pepperoni or two!"}
{"text":"This rating is only for the taste of tremont experience.
They were quick to order, friendly when asking for suggestions, and quick to get the food out hot and fresh!
The pizza was perfect amount of sauce, crust, and cheese. It was the perfect thickness, wasn't deep and wasn't thin crust. Did i mention the slices were a large size? That was awesome!
I have been wanting to try them and couldn't pass it up at the event. Cant wait to go back again and try more than one slice!"}
{"text":"I really loved the Spicy Bacon Spinach Tomato Pizza. It came with a side of honey to drizzle on the pizza. At this point I knew pizza would never be the same. If I could have a slice a day for the rest of my life, I would. It was  a great place for great local craft beer, fire pizza, free popcorn and a pool game with some good friends to top it off!"}
{"text":"Oh my good gooogilee mooogilee this place is my jam.  Best pizza in the city as far as I'm concerned.  Get a pepperoni pizza and you can't even see the cheese under it there's so many of those delicious, greasy, slightly curved at the edge (because they were baked to perfection), circles of meathood!  That's how you make a pizza.  Also I have NEVER had pizza from anywhere in this country that held up so well heated up in the microwave the next day.  The crust fluffs right back up to its original glory.  It's insane! You know what else is insane and almost cost this place two stars?  Putting f$&%*ing honey packets with my order and recommending I defile your already perfect crust with it.  What's next, putting pineapple slices on a pizza?  Just stop."}
{"text":"I'm gonna talk this place up mostly because I've got some pretty solid and deeply-embedded memories of the joint but also because I totally dig their grub. My first job out of college - waaay back in 1998 - was with a company that had a lab just down the street on Scranton Rd. My colleagues and I used to frequent Edison's and this, their sister eatery, and partake with a nearly religious level of devotion. I can remember waiting outside for them to open their doors when we got there a bit too early. While the lab has long since closed its doors, Edison's Pizza Kitchen continues to crank out the greasy goodness.

Edison's Pizza Kitchen is located next door to the Edison's Pub. Actually, they're connected via a little hallway toward the back that leads to the pass-through/order window. It's a simple place. Pizza, salads, sandwiches, stromboli, wings. Is it good for you? Hell no. Is it delicious? Frick yeah. It's greasy, served in mind-boggling large proportions (thank you Cleveland) and filled with unchanged tradition. While I have to admit that my experiences with their food has been limited to their wings and pizza, this shouldn't stop you from wandering their menu. I'm just a creature of habit.

Walk into the bar, get greeted by the tatted purveyors of potent potables, up the stairs, hang a louie, you're there. Ring the bell for service, order, and make sure to tell them where you'll be hanging out so they can connect you with your food when it's done.

Does it take awhile for them to make it? I suppose that's subjective. I've never minded and, frankly, I've never noticed. I tend to down a couple beers during the wait so it's never bothered me. If you're in a hurry just be a little proactive and give yourself more time than you'd normally give a shitty chain like Domino's. It's worth it, trust me.

The pizza is rather impressive. The crust is buttery, garlicky, and dusted with Parmesan cheese. Are all of the toppings \"garden fresh\"? Not a chance. I grew up on canned mushrooms and banana peppers. Sometimes, childhood memories trump just-picked. The sauce, a touch sweet. The cheese, a wonderful level of stretch. I recommend keeping it simple - pepperoni, mushroom, banana pepper. The little containers of honey they serve with each pie I don't personally get. Kitschy and memorable, I just don't put it on my pizza."}
{"text":"This pizza is the equivalent of Taco Bell food. It's only good at 2am when you are really drunk. Sober you realize it's not made under the most sanitary conditions. The workers all wear sleeveless shirts and do not have AC so you can see the sweat dripping off them. They also don't wear gloves or hair nets and they do not wash there hands between touching money and making your pizza. Frankly I'm surprised the health department has never been involved."}
{"text":"I think virtually all of the pizza I've ever had in Cleveland sucks. Except Edisons. 

I like a thinner crust pizza, but what I really care about is flavor. And crispy pepperonis. Honestly, those are the two things I care about. Crusts can be whatever, but I want good toppings and cheese, cooked correctly. I'm surprised there are so many so-so reviews. I've only ever had take out slices and it's always been great. 

Sometimes I'll even have them cook it another extra minute or two, get those pepperonis really crispy. The one reviewer is right though, it smells so good that it's hard to wait for it to cool off/potentially save your mouth from extreme trauma.

It would be a four star place elsewhere. But compared to everything else I've had around here, five it is. 

Edisons ownership: Would you please consider opening a 2nd shop in Ohio City? We're dyin' over here, we got nothin! And I know this is asking a lot but, deliver? There's a ton of money to be made! Your only direct competition is Pizza Hut, Nunzios and Ohio CIty Pizza, your quality is WAY above theirs."}
{"text":"First it's the smell of pizza then the taste of real pizza.  I've heard of Edison pizza but never had it until the Taste of Tremont festival 2016. It was cheesy, lots of pepperoni, and sauce was so good.  I can't wait to place an order for a whole pizza not just a slice."}
{"text":"Lovely place for a quick late night slice of pizza. For just $3 a slice (+$ for extra toppings), its a bargain. I ordered a cheese slice with chicken while my gf had the pepperoni and mushroom. Both slices were quite big and were loaded with toppings. The slices itself was thin but with a big crunchy crust. The sauces and cheese on the pizza was quite good and was not too oily. The chicken on my pizza was lightly seasoned and was white meat. I would say there's close to a small can of mushrooms on my gf's slice! The pepperoni was also very good and crispy.

This place opens late so I'll definitely keep this place in mind while strolling around Tremont."}
{"text":"I have lived in Cleveland for two years now. I've tried lots of pizzas. There are many good ones. Edison's is arguably, the city's best pizza.  The crust is a bit thick but not crunchy. There is just the right amount of cheese, thick and gooey. The toppings are just the right amount. The sauce is tangy and good. It is sprinkled with parmesan to finish. Delicious! It is connected to the bar next door. Just order carry out and park yourself into a booth. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what all the hype is about. I feel like each review is a drunken review, they have to be, because that's the only time this pizza has ever tasted good to me.  

I've ordered pizza from here on numerous occasions.  When I'm drunk the slices are AWESOME... When I'm sober, I'm disgusted that I chose their pizza over Crust, or even the 3am pie at that place on Detroit in Lakewood.  

Soggy soggy crust, the cheese is okay, love the honey they give you when you order a whole pie.  That's about it.  The honey gimmick.  

I hate to be harsh but it's not good."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and pick up food from here often. Portions are all large and will last you a few days. I love their house salad. It has fresh mixed greens and TONS of toppings!! I also really like the cheesy bread and calzones. Both come with sides of (cold) marinara. Slices are greasy but delicious with lots of cheese; definitely good to satisfy those late night munchies. Staff is not always the friendliest. I understand they deal with a lot of drunk people and are super busy, but it's the same when I come here on the weekdays."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Cleveland if you ask for pepperoni they give you pepperoni on every square inch of your pizza and dont put to much sauce like alot of pizza places do to where there sauce pouring out of your cheese"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall but the pizza is amazing! Very dive bar feeling inside but the live music is a bonus. Pools tables are a nice addition. Bathrooms could use some attention."}
{"text":"I still love this pie, but tonight's service was rather disappointing. 

A bit of an attitude from the servers, they got our order wrong, boo. The worst part was I was excited for the great pizza I was used to, but got a pizza way too loaded up with mushrooms, just sitting, soggy-like on top of our pie. It just wasn't as good as usual. 

I'll come back but tonight was not so good."}
{"text":"I'm going to limit this review to three sentences and this is my first. Best pizza I've had in 10 years. Don't pass go, don't collect $200, but stop here and get the spinach and bacon pizza because it is effing amazing."}
{"text":"Damaged pizza for damaged, wasted cuckoos.
Hate waiting around for the pizza, hate when some dark bro hits on my girlfriend for the two seconds I go to the bathroom, do not like the people that go here.

Edison's is raw dawg, and every time I get a slice of pizza from here there is something off about it - I'll take a slice from Zappetelli's or anywhere else pretty much, as I like to stay the hell out of Tremont anyway.

Sorry 2 hate, this place gets deuces.
Peace."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing! Stopped in for a few slices, tried both the pepperoni and the cheese- they were both so delicious.  The space in there is very limited but you can take your pizza next door to enjoy. The prices are great too."}
{"text":"This. Is. Great.  Fritos on sandwiches?  Yes, please.  What drunko doesn't want pizza?  
Did you catch the bit about the Fritos on the sandwiches?!?!?!"}
{"text":"great trivia, good beers, AMAZING PIZZA. wow. goes perfect with the beers. ample seating and great, personable servers."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go as far to call it the best in Cleveland, but it's fantastic.  Definitely give it a try!  Sample the white pizza - delish.  

Great for late night - they will give you a hefty slice for $2.50"}
{"text":"Cheap, average pizza - should really only be eaten after having had 3+ beers...or just 1 if you're Asian."}
{"text":"I think the pizza scene in Cleveland is weak, but this place never is.  It's really the only west side pizza joint I even bother with anymore.  They really load on the toppings here and have an excellent crust."}
{"text":"Sometimes on a Saturday evening after a few drinks you just want a nice big, greasy, cheesy slice of pizza. At Edison's you can find just that, and if you're lucky, you'll find an empty bench close by to sit on and enjoy that hot fresh slice of goodness."}
{"text":"There are not many things that I miss about Cleveland  but Edison's is indeed one of the things that I do miss... 

Love the pizza (whether you liked a specialty one or basic), love the quick service, and beer selection in the pub!  Nothing to complain about!"}
{"text":"O ordered two slices of pepperoni pizza.  The pepperoni was disappointing.  The pizza was too greasy for me.  The crust and red sauce was pretty good."}
{"text":"Gooey, cheesy, greasy goodness pizza pie slice until late night cannot beat. And crazy convenient on professor close to bars and restaurants. Not to mention quick and (mostly) friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza at this spot isn't bad plus it stays open late so can't beat that after a long night. Slices are fairly good size. I got 2 pepperoni slices. They were fresh out the oven and slightly greasy. Perfect . Sauce is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Edison's is one of Cleveland's must try pizza places.  Their generosity with toppings and unique lightly buttered and Parmesan dusted crust are fantastic.  You will be given a side of honey for you pizza which I recommend trying even if your first reaction is to pass on the experience.

You have several options as there is a bar area, regular restaurant seating, a patio and even an outside walk up to buy pizza by the slice. (Cheese and Pepperoni only usually)  Like any place in Tremont you can expect a wide variety of beers on tap or in the bottle.  This is one of the places I bring most non-Clevelanders too at least once."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4, 5 times now. and although I've only had 1 of their pizzas before, I have to rave about it.

If you ever come to Edison's make sure to order their Chicken Bacon Ranch Pizza. It is soooo delicious that even the calories don't matter! :D

When my michigan friends drive down to visit, they always make sure to stop by Edisons Pizza just for their chicken bacon ranch pizza!

The reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is simply because of how fattening and unhealthy the dish is. Other than that, best pizza in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I LOVE PIZZA!!!!!! And I've been all over the city
Trying pizza since I was a young lad lol. A friend of mines told me about the place and me and wife stopped here after leaving downtown a few years ago...right away I fell in love and the relationship is still going strong When you can master classics like pepperoni, you have to try more. The chicken bacon ranch is out of this world. The calzones are as big as the small pizza box i have designated this place as the best in Cleveland. I won't stop eating pizza and traveling the city, but this is my clear cut favorite!"}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good the pepperoni's were well done. Next time I will have them cook the pizza a little longer so that it will be well done. The dough was a little undercooked. I will also try it with honey next time."}
{"text":"This place really hits the spot. I have only had the slices and they were pretty good. Lots of pepperoni. Lots of sauce which I like. Crust was crispy and not super thick. Good amount of cheese. A little greasy, did the napkin thing. Added lots of hot pepper flakes. This is probably some of the best pizza by the slice in Cleveland. Now I even had it one time when I was not impaired by mojitos, and it was still good. Only 2.50 a slice. One slice was enough for me, but back in my fat days 2 slices would have sufficed. Oh yeah, there is a bar attached to the place, in case you need a beer.The best by -the- slice used to be Captain Tony's on Coventry. I had some really good stuff in Montreal and Toronto but I don't remember the names. I'll stop rambling!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection. Only a handful of taps, like 6 or so, but a nearly endless selection of craft bottles. And the also seem to have the best pizza in the Tremont area. If you are getting a slice, try the pepperoni and drizzle some honey on it (honey packets are $0.25). I know I know, it sounds insane, but the bartender convinced me to try it and I can't go there and not do this! It's insanely delicious. 

The bartenders have always been very friendly and helpful if you are looking for a beer recommendation. Also, very nice patio out back and on a nice summer day I recommend playing darts on their patio dart board (though bring your own chalk, they are frequently out of chalk).

Overall, just a great bar."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. My favorite pizza in Cleveland. I may be wrong about this, but I'm pretty sure most of the pizzas are pre-made and then run through again after order to give the crust a really nice crisp. It is literally the greasiest thing I've ever eaten, but it's totally worth every bite. The customer service here (oy, vey... are they ever happy?) isn't very friendly, but the pizza pulls at my heartstrings. 

If you haven't tried it, do it. But keep it simple. Don't overdo the toppings. Do it. I dare you. XO"}
{"text":"I love this place!  This pizza will spoil you and you will not want anything else.  We always get pepperoni but last night we also ordered the house salad.  It was huge and full of so many toppings.  Worth the cost because everything is quality.  My advice is plan ahead and order early.  The wait can be up to 1 1/2 hours."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for pizza in Cleveland. Our go-to is the hot bacon spinach pizza, which has a white pizza base with spinach, bacon, feta cheese, and a hot bacon dressing. I don't even usually like specialty pizzas, but can't get enough of this one. It's a great mixture of spicy, sweet, and savory. Their plain or pizza with topping pizzas are good as well, the crust is just a little thicker than I like so the specialty pizza with all the toppings is, in my opinion, needed to compliment the thickness of the crust.

We recently placed a larger order for an event we were hosting - party salad, six pizzas, a sub. I called ahead a few hours and they were happy to make the order for us. It was a Sunday evening and they were pretty busy, but they were organized and had everything ready within ten minutes of when I asked for the order to be ready. I went on my own (kind of silly) to pick up the order and they let me pull into their driveway and two of the workers helped to carry everything out. I was very impressed with the service, and very grateful."}
{"text":"Whether you are stone cold sober or completely hammered, Edison's enormous slices of pizza are delicious and satisfying. I got a slice of pepperoni pizza and I couldn't see the dough through all the happy slices of pepperoni! The only downside about this place is that there can be a wait if you stop in on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"GOOD PIZZA! The owner. Or manager,  was possibly the least pleasant person I've met in Cleveland. ...  so. If you were a Seinfeld fan... he's cleveland's version of a balding,goatee clad soup nazi... Maybe he just had a bad day...either way. Really good pizza... and we learned the s cleveland secret of drizzling honey on the pie.... definitely worth the try if you are in Tremont....or cleveland... or ohio.... Mr. Pizza Nazi.... just messing with you a little.  Overall good experience! No pizza for you!"}
{"text":"Bought a single slice of Cheese pizza and was surprised at how good the pizza was from this place.  I will definitely be back.  Pizza was hot, fresh, and had a very good crust.   5 Stars all the way."}
{"text":"If you can tolerate the noise (loud) and the environment (dive bar), this is by far the best place in the Cleveland area to get pizza.  The crust is hand-made and neither too thick nor thin and cracker-ish.  The pepperoni is aged and is cooked long enough to curl up and darken a little.  The cheese is nice and melty.  The pizza comes to you piping hot and gloriously greasy.  If this review were based just on the pizza, it would easily be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Okay so this is hands down, the best pizza in Tremont and the best pepperoni pizza in Cleveland. If you love a good salty, greasy pizza, then this is the place to go. The first time I had this pizza, I had it by the slice at $3 and OMG it was like no other! I loved Pizza Hut but after having this. . . I will never eat Pizza Hut ever again! Never! Oh, the grease!!!! Oh the salt and the HONEY! This pizza comes with honey of all things. I was skeptical once I saw it in my pizza box (because I decided that on my third visit one slice was't going to cut it any more) and I'm not a fan of honey, but yes! Honey and  this pizza is a wonderful climax on my tongue! There's something about the taste of Smucker's honey that I just can't get enough of, and if you try this combination with any other pizza and honey (which I have and FAILED, you will be disappointed). Let me reiterate that Edison's pepperoni pizza is so good and if you don't try this pizza you are truly missing out on the best thing that's ever happened to your taste buds.

** Customer service is Muh, whatever, they take my order correctly and the pizza is perfect every time. I love this pizza please don't change! You have a guaranteed $20 from me every other month because whoa this pizza is very dangerous and might have you wishing you would have never committed to eating it at all, it's that good. 

It's not for someone who's health conscious or who's worried about calorie count. Also, I dare you to eat more than 2 slices and if you are bold like me you will attempt to eat a 3rd but never a 4th it's just way too rich in flavor, don't let greed ruin it for you. 

*keep in mind, those of you that read my reviews I am very honest and a great review from me, means you're the shit!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! You get what you pay for and it's worth the wait. The staff are really nice. You get big slices and so cheesy. Its my go to spot after hanging out in CLE. Love my city! Edison's pizza is where its at!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza indeed.  Generous to a fault with toppings, crust butter, and Parmesan around the rim.  First time trying, but it may be the best we have tried on the West side so far.  Well for the thick kind of pizza anyway.  It is hard to put a best on pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Perfect place to come to for a late night pizza on a Friday and Saturday night when you just want to curb your appetite. Hours are awesome! Prices are great!"}
{"text":"Perfectly good, greasy complement to a pint of beer. They have a very small kitchen, so your order may take a little while."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious and piping hot. The live music on Saturday nights is awesome. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Tough to find parking with construction going on. Keep searching though the pizza is worth it."}
{"text":"This is going to be a short one...

I've had a few pepperoni pizza and a few sandwiches from Edison's.  The sandwiches are always huge and taste great.  The pizza is definitely among the best in Cleveland.  Unfortunately, I feel that it's also the greasiest/oiliest pizza I've ever eaten and I almost always get a stomachache after eating it.  This makes me sad.

Still, the crust is excellent and whatever blend of cheese they use is perfect.  They also give you honey for dipping, something I don't think I've seen anywhere else.  It's a nice touch.

I definitely recommend Edison's, but be aware of the grease and the (potentially) long wait."}
{"text":"I have huge beef with Edison's. Unfortunately for me, their pizza is delicious enough that I keep trying, but my frustration with their service is so, well, frustrating that I wish I could just quit it altogether.

So, Edison's the pizza place is apparently unaffiliated with Edison's the bar, except for the fact that the former has a pizza walk-up window within the latter. Aside from that, they are unrelated, which means that if you are physically sitting at Edison's the bar & want to eat a pizza while you're there, you get no priority or preferential service for ordering from the pizza shop live & in 3D; it's not like ordering in a regular bar or restaurant that's ready for you. You just have to wait it out behind apparently a thousand to-go orders, or something. This means that the wait is regularly anywhere from 50 minutes to two hours, & in my experience, usually closer to the long end. The same goes for the walk-in side, where you can order just a slice - I've been quoted up to an hour there.

The service is crap, with the people who work there (the kitchen side) not bothering to be friendly because, frankly, they know they don't need your business. If they've got a two-hour wait for pizzas, they don't care whether you order or not - & in fact, they'd probably rather you didn't. They're totally unapologetic to the point of sometimes just grumbling in your face & telling you \"it's gonna be awhile, no promises on timing.\" Always helpful to hear. 

On the rare occasion (twice) that I've been able to eat Edison's pizza - out of the probably eight or nine times that I've tried - it's been so delicious that I am infuriated at the fact that it's so damn hard to get. Their chicken bacon ranch pizza is straight-up gourmet, & it's served with a side of honey, which sounds disgusting but is actually kind of amazing. 

Edison's, love to hate you & I hate to love you. You make me a real mix of emotions."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite pizza slices in the city of Cleveland. My fiancé and I went to dinner in Tremont, and after 4-6 happy hour drinks, we were still hungry when we left so we stopped at Edison's for a slice. 

Best. Slice. I've. Had. In. Cleveland. So. Far. 

It was greasy, the pepperonis were crunchy around the edges, it was ridiculously cheesy. The gal that heated up our slice brushed olive oil on the crust and covered it with Parmesan. Best little addition ever. I haven't been to the actual restaurant/bar itself, but I might find myself over to grab a couple slices tonight and tomorrow and the next day. It's THAT good and totally worth the drive from West Park, where we reside."}
{"text":"Whoever decided to attach a pizzeria to a bar is a genius!  I was hanging out in the pub portion of Edison's and watched people line up for hours to get pizza.  At one point there was an hour wait - just for a single slice!

Granted, this may not be the best pizza ever.  But for \"bar pizza\" it's pretty good.  As other reviewers have said, this pizza probably tastes better after a couple drinks.  I had the calzone, or 5 pounds of ricotta cheese stuffed into some thick pizza dough.  It was ok.  My friends really seemed to like their pizza.  They were a little confused by the honey that came along with it, but after they tried it with the crust, they were sold.  (I'm half tempted to try eating pizza this way at home just to see if it's weird or not.)

If you're looking for some good greasy grub on a night out in Tremont, check out Edison's.  And be sure to pet the stray cat that seems to hang out right near the warm pizza oven."}
{"text":"We stopped at Edison's a few times and I feel like I should give the place some hype.  We usually stop and get the slices.  I personally love the pepperoni and my wife loves the cheese.  It is some greasy goodness that is good down to the last bite.  I love the sauce and how the crust of the pizza is sweet.  The one downside for patrons is this place is usually busy and is very small inside.  But when you have awesome food that's to be expected.  If you want good eats anytime check this place out will not disappoint."}
{"text":"If you are just feelin a slice.... Amazing slices.
If you are feelin a specialty pie... Amazing hot bacon spinach pizza.
I would say they have it all covered.
Eat the zzaaaaa."}
{"text":"Traditional pizza of a very high caliber. Nice bar atmosphere. 

Food:
Delicious pizza made-to-order. Nothing pretentious at work here, just some great pies. Don't expect goat cheese or remoulade. These pizzas are simple blue collar delights. The pepperoni is crisp, the cheese pulls in thick hot ribbons, and the crust is dappled in a cheery dusting of parm. There's a decent beer list too. 

Atmosphere:
Quintessential Americana bar décor, albeit with certain cheeky pop culture touches like a few prints from a local artist of famous film characters (Gangs of New York Daniel Day Lewis, for instance, scowling on an unexpected neon backdrop). Elsewhere, there's a pool table and some pretty comfy booths. A very spacious back patio is a highlight--doubtlessly one of the best in town. 

Staff:
Speedy if ambivalent bartenders. 

Closing:
Pizza, pool, patio. Period."}
{"text":"Wowwwww is this pizza delicious. I'm pretty much a no frills pizza guy. Specialty pizza can be good, but I always revert to pepperoni, and this may the best slice of pepperoni I've ever had. It's that fantastic, small, curled up, crispy pepperoni that almost tastes a bit like bacon. They don't skimp on the meat either, each slice is loaded with probably 25 pieces. 

It's $4 a slice, but it was a really big slice. We took them next door and ate at the bar. There's no seats here, and not much room for more than a couple of people to place orders. 

I came here solely based on the pictures I'd seen from some fellow Yelpers, and for once, high expectations didn't disappoint. 

If they could open up a shop in Kent/Stow I'd really appreciate it, thanks."}
{"text":"They got rid of the stoners. The pizza, especially the pepperoni, is some of the best I've had.  They pile on the pepperoni like they used to at Geraci's (but don't anymore).   So good.  Sometimes I think about that pizza while on the treadmill."}
{"text":"Ive had this pizza twice since i moved to Cleveland.(i am eastsider and dont get over much to the west side)..The first time i had it honestly was not a fan at all... The crust was gooey and the sauce had no flavor. I was also sober. This as i have found was my mistake when coming here. The 2nd time around, i had a bit to drink before coming her... And the pepperoni pizza was amazing. Im upset they couldn't put sausage on for me but hey it is what it is... Next time i need something to soak up the bourbon i know where im going.. May have to order a whole pie this time around."}
{"text":"Hot Bacon and Spinach pizza was the best pizza I've ever had - I highly recommend it! 

We had to wait about 45 min to an hour for it though. Worth the wait, but I'd call to order in advance next time."}
{"text":"This has been rated for having best pizza in town, I must say it's definitely worth a try.
Go for pizza not for ambience. We ordered a blue cheese pizza with mushrooms, tomatoes and green peppers. It was great. They were generous with toppings, the crust a bit thick but not doughy."}
{"text":"I've never had the sketchy service other reviews are mentioning but their pies are some of the best in Cleveland. Great little place. Can be very busy but if you want good food sometimes you have to wait. I highly recommend Edison's."}
{"text":"Literally the best pizza I've ever had in my life. I LOVE toppings on pizza, and they do not disappoint. I hate when places give you 5 pepperonis and 2 mushrooms. Edison's loads it on and the ingredients are always fresh and delicious. I live in New York but whenever I come home to Cleveland Edison's is my first stop!!!!! Just make sure you call and put in your order early -- they get super busy and the wait can be 2 hours! However, grab some free popcorn and a beer and hang out on the back patio and the wait for the best pizza ever isn't so bad."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I think I somehow suffered a head injury previous to my first review of Edison's pizza.  Either that or just a so-so experience my first couple of times here.  The pizza here is great and the loading of of toppings that they do here is awesome.  That goes for any pizza too - not just pepperoni. Get a bacon pizza and see that thing just covered with the stuff.   It's not a saucy pizza, which I normally like it that way. But they manage to create a great pie without much. I have had the pizza many times now with many variations of toppings...they are all great. The buffalo chicken pizza is a cool choice too but I'll warn you it's certainly spicer than you would expect.  The combination of Edison's pizza and Edison's bar is just perfect for a good night out."}
{"text":"Honey on pizza? Honey? On pizza? 

Yes. Don't question it. Slather it. Slather it all over your pizza. Open up that little packet of Smucker's honey and douse the pizza of your choice in delicious type 2 diabetes. 

That is all."}
{"text":"OMG I'm in love. No for real. 

There are few things on this earth better than a huge, cheap slice of greasy pizza at the end of the night. Very few. 

Pizza: Really good. Thinnish crust with plenty of cheese and toppings are fresh. Quite greasy but hey, I love it. Definitely try it with the honey that comes free with a regular pizza. You can buy a packet for a quarter if you're getting a slice. Drizzle it on top of the hot pizza and try something new. I bet you'll like it. 

Service: I love the fact that you can get a slice with no waiting and you can shoot the shit with the pizza dude for a few minutes while you're at it. Not too many walk up, grab food, and leave places in the CLE. In addition to the guy who's super nice, there are a couple ladies that are always in there - not the friendliest but not rude either. I can't say I'd be emitting rainbows and unicorns if I was trapped in a tiny non-air-conditioned room standing next to a giant oven all night either. 

As others have said, the only downer is how long you'll wait for a regular pizza. But now that you know this - just call ahead! I'm not taking a star away because if you're truly in a hurry, you can opt for the slice on the run. If not, you've got Edison's bar actually hooked onto the pizza kitchen for your waiting pleasure. Grab a beer, watch the game and relax. The patio is small but quaint. Dogs allowed :) 

Glad we finally tried Edison's. It's now solidly in the rotation."}
{"text":"YAAAAAASSSS KWEEEEEN! Best pizza in the Cleveland area! The only complaint I have is that they get so busy wait times exceed an hour most weekends. But as long as your don't have a furry friend with you, you can just grab a drink at the attached bar while you wait!"}
{"text":"De. Lish. 

Tastes good, looks good. The cheese is perfectly melted, but still chewy. They include honey packets for the perfect finish to that last piece of parmesan sprinkled crust."}
{"text":"Pizza took forever to come out and the person behind the counter seemed offended that I had the audacity to ask them to take my order to the bar when ready as I was there for bar trivia. Idk if it was out of spite or a mistake, but when it finally came out the slices were wrong - I asked for three slices of different toppings and they gave three slices of all three toppings. I also didn't think the pizza was that good -- plenty of better options around. Not a must visit by any stretch"}
{"text":"Edisons pizza still surpasses all other Cleveland favorites in my opinion. That being said, their customer service skills could use some work. Would it hurt to smile or try to be nice? Very gruff here. 

Ask for a few honey packets on the side, everybody's doing it! The buffalo/barbecue wings are also a good accompaniment to your pizza, besides an immediate nap after you eat."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland. Lots of melted cheese with plenty of pepperoni. Asks for extra honey and drizzle it on every bite. You won't regret. Also open late night, but call in advance!"}
{"text":"The gold standard for late night pizza cravings in Cleveland. The wait can be an excerise in patience, but the pizza is worth it. Getting a whole pizza can be an extemely long wait, but one slice per person is more than enough in the late night hours. Not a thin crust, but it is foldable. Not deep dish, but the cheese and sauce is luxurious. The grease is bad for you, but that's what napkins are for. Oh, and trust me, get the honey."}
{"text":"Regina was a pleasure. we had been traveling from Baltimore back home to Massachusetts. we were so hungry and in such a hurry too. she was pleasant, got our food served quickly and had us on our way. it was delicious and fresh! 
Veronica C"}
{"text":"I was going to give them a one star, but i just feel bad and give them 2 only because I truly love Edison's pub next door. But the pizza???? the wings??? I'm utterly confused by all the reviews saying it's the best pizza in town? I'm really not a food snob, and maybe it's because I'm used to NY pizza, but this just tasted like greasy dominos pizza. Just got the good old plain pizza. The crust is just too thick and mushy, and greasy!!! And the oven baked wings...i really really wanted to like them because I loved the idea of serving oven baked wings. But they lacked taste, they were cooked too much, and I just couldn't eat that many(usually you have to stop yourself from eating too many!). Ordered the garlic parmesan and buffalo. What i ended up doing is pouring honey all over the wings, which gave them a slight kick and allowed me to eat more than 4....Disappointed. I wish I wasn't ."}
{"text":"Guys and gals, I'm almost at a loss for words. I'm dumbfounded. I think we are dealing with an absentee owner, and that's a shame. This place has so much potential. The customer service is AWFUL. When you call, they often give the impression they DON'T want you to order. WHAT THE HECK?! The bartenders next door are also RUDE and UNWELCOMING. The only reason this place gets 1 Star is because the food is incredible. However, I am NEVER going here again. Too many RUDE workers. Hey, I get it, you don't want to work in the food industry. Ya know what? DON'T WORK THERE, THEN. I beg you to please overhaul the ENTIRE staff. We are living in a society. I am DONE. I was actually TURNED AWAY over the phone from giving them business because they were busy. \"Are you sure you wanna wait that long for your food?\" Is what they have asked me. WOW"}
{"text":"There is a long tradition of pizza places whose food is so good that the mediocre service and excessive wait times are completely offset. This is one of those.

Do you like greasy pepperoni pizza? Do you like stretchy creamy cheese? Do you like a traditional tomato sauce that is *not* sweet? Do you like a crust that can stand up to that grease? Are you drunk at 1am? Then this place is for you!

You will wait an hour *at least* for your pizza. It's worth it. If you're in a rush, you can always grab a slice or two on the go, but you probably won't get anything but cheese. Wait for the pepperoni. Just do it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza place in the Cleveland area. I'm typically not crazy about really greasy pizza, but their pizza is greasy and it's absolutely  delightful. They give out honey packets with their pizza, too! Shockingly it tastes great. If you're a white pizza sauce fan- you must try theirs- it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"In town for a concert and was looking for a local pizza place where I could find just some greasy, good ole fashioned pizza. I went to the right spot. Ordered a whole pie and it took a little longer than expected, but it was worth the wait because it was some of the best pizza I've had in a long time. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Their pizza is my absolute favorite.  But, I'm not the only one.  So, their wait times are usually outrageous.  And, they don't open til 4pm, which couldn't come sooner on many o' Sundays.  But, it is always well worth the wait.  They really don't skim on toppings.  If you couldn't see the crust, you would think you were just eating a big round hot flat salad.

Beware of the pizza by the slice.  You've been drinking, you smell the pizza, you order it, you watch them pour parm cheese on the butter on the crust, and you can't wait to get that in your mouth.  Then you do.  And you wake up with blisters all over the roof of your mouth because you couldn't eat it fast enough.  They're the best."}
{"text":"I grew up in New York not far from NYC and Edison's is as close as I can find to a NYC slice...this is my favorite place for piazza in Cleveland...the stark weather salad is awsome too...i definately did not expect mesclun greens from a bar/pizZa place...really good surprise! Thursday night Trivia is fun but gets loud and crowded so get a good table by getting there early!!!"}
{"text":"This is Cleveland hillbilly pizza. It is a testament to our Appalachian roots. A song by the classic hip hop group The Alkaholiks best represents my behavior around Edison's Pizza: Only When I'm Drunk. 

I don't like the taste of the pizza. I do like the fact that I have never had a hangover if I ate it after drinking. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSwKOn1Dxh4"}
{"text":"I gave this review 4 stars for the pizza alone. I'm convinced that Edison's makes the best chicken bacon ranch pizza on the planet. Every friend that I have shown Edison's to has told me it is some of the best pizza they've ever had. The staff is very abrupt. I haven't exeperienced them being rude, but they really don't have any inclination to acknowledge you other than to take your money. You also may find yourself waiting upwards of 90
minutes if you order on a weekend evening. Don't plan on eating there either, the pub isn't a good place to dine. Take it home. The pizza is phenomenal trough, I can promise that. If this place rose their standards in customer service, and somehow accommodated people who want a comfortable atmosphere to sit down and eat their pizza, Edison's would be a staple of Cleveland."}
{"text":"One slice and you're hooked. Maaaan this pizza is good. I just had a slice of pepperoni but I'll definitely be going back. I wanted a whole pie but wait time was two hours (Saturday night- which is probably typical). Go there and get a slice for $4 and you'll see what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"My partner in crime and I were looking for a good pie late one night and decided to give this a try. It is a different set up from you typical joint. There is no table service so you have to order your beer and pizza separately. The menu is quite extensive with some good options. We decided to go with building our own medium pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. I was a little skeptical of the $16 price but I was not disappointed. When the pizza arrived it was LOADED with toppings. Edison's is by far the best place I have had in amount of toppings. The taste was on point and one of the best pizzas I have had in a long time. One of the nice things was that the pizza is brought to you in to-go box. So once you have had enough you can just pack up and head out. I will definitely be back to check out some of their specialty pizzas. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Cleveland on business - as a foodie and HUGE Pizza freak...I had to try this place.  Took a cab from downtown 2.5 miles to the west side and was very happy with my decision.  This is the classic dive joint ... there are no hostesses...you walk past the bar and bang a left to the \"order window\"...they write down a time when the pie will be ready on your order stub.  It was WELL worth the wait!  This pie tastes like \"Marions pizza on steroids\"...if you are from Kettering/centerville...this should make sense ... beautiful crunchy crust and excellent sauce ... this place is a gem ... I'll be back (if I'm in Cleveland) - nice work Edisons - (I ate all but one slice of a medium mushroom/well done pie)... if you're not ordering well done, don't talk to me about pizza.  Peace"}
{"text":"Some of the best greasy pizza in the greater Cleveland area...."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place that keeps things casual in a trendy area. Pizza by the slice is in the back and to the left. There's free popcorn and darts. Great place to begin and end the night."}
{"text":"Just picked up what will be my last pizza from here. Is it good? Sure. Is it worth the attitude and the cowering to ask for a couple more $.10 honey? Nah, I'm good. It's not that good. Shouldn't feel like I'm privileged to be there."}
{"text":"Edison's pizza is pretty good pizza, but they are open late night on weekends which makes them better than everyone else by default. After the bars Edison's is clutch when you just want a slice of hot pepperoni pizza and to dip it into Ranch! If you are a toppings person they do not shy away from loading it up with everything you order. 

The only downfall is the amount of time it takes to get a full pie late night. Sometimes the wait can be over an hour and a half. Lesson learned ALWAYS ORDER BY THE SLICE. They make the slice pizzas in between everyone's orders so slices are always available first!! 

I have yet to go into Edison's for the beer but I hear that it has a very hometown bar feel with cheap, cold beer. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I seen a picture of one of their pizzas and decided to go check out the spot.
Go to place my order and the lady said it would be 1.5 hours for a pizza at 4pm on Saturday.
I was offered to buy slices of pizza at $3 a piece, but my family is 4 people.
Why not offer my family to wait in the dinning room and give me 4 slices of pizza.
Why let the customer with money walk out of your business, and she seemed to not have a problem letting us leave.
I can understand if it was delivery, but 1.5 hours for a carry out pizza smh!!!"}
{"text":"Whether you're catchin' lunch real quick, a casual date, or wasted on Friday night, Edison's Pizza is hands down the best in Cleveland! Not to mention, the Edison's atmosphere is one of the best i have encountered up to this point in my life. Kitchen staff is very down to earth, hospitable and on point. The same goes for the bar staff, all around great people and a good place to be and relax..."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza in Cleveland.  I'm always surprised when people haven't heard of it before.  Unless you want to wait a long time to eat, call in your pizza order before you get there.  The Pub has a cool vibe to it and a great beer selection."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza's in Cleveland. The pepperoni pizza if filled with incredibly crisp pepperoni and all pizza can be bought by the slice."}
{"text":"This pizza is good, but it is just normal pizza.  Its quick and cheap yet surprisingly tasty. There is better food in Tremont but when your starving and low on cash Edison's is a great option.  They get busy late on the weekends so call ahead if you know you are going to be needing some."}
{"text":"Confession: I talked on the phone for hours with an old friend instead of making dinner. So, when I realized that dinner plans had gone to the wayside, what other idea can beat pizza night?! Except, I don't ever go for the chain/delivery joints. Luckily the Yelp community never lets me down when it comes to this. 

Side note: Edison's is kind of split in two - the pub & the pizza kitchen. I, of course, walked into the pub when picking up my order. Although - the atmosphere totally made me want to hang out! Really cool vibe... must return to check that out soon. 

So, the pizza. They have all sorts of specialty choices. I went with the Hot Bacon Spinach. Think spinach salad with hot bacon dressing... Hmm... yeah - it was good. The crust was well done, with a distinct olive oil and herb flavor. The white pizza was the real deal - olive oil, herbs, good cheese. It wasn't a creamy alfredo mess like some places surprise you with. 

Honey? I'm of the assumption that if a restaurant provides you with a whacky ingredient, its most definitely for a reason, so one must indulge. Yeah - um... honey on pizza? Pretty amazing, actually. In a weird, ridiculous \"I shouldn't be liking this so much\" kind of way. 

Edison's is definitely a repeat for me."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had! Here's why:
-Generous cheese and toppings
-Crunchy bottom crust with a bit of chewy as well
-The crust is dusted with fine Parmesan, parsley and garlic
-I swear I taste a hint of honey, delicious 
-Friendly staff
-Quick service especially considering how small it is
-Great prices
-Open late!"}
