{"text":"A little history.........  In the early 1960's a German/Italian couple opened a pizza place in Brookgate Shopping center called Pizza Den. He had a place to sit down and eat inside but was much more famous for his to go business for one reason only, he lacked patience with his customers and came across as very mean. He answered the phone \"Hello Pizza Den\" insert Old, Tired, German/Italian accent to busy to take your order voice. He was offset by his very friendly, warm and inviting Wife!  My parents had a tradition with us kids, every Friday was pizza day at the old household. We always ordered from Pizza Den! We couldn't wait for it to arrive 4 little kids who could barely see over the table, eyes wide open and tongues hanging out of there mouths in anticipation of the worlds greatest food! Loved it! These were the best of times!  Fast forward to 1980 my first real job was when a young man from the East side of Cleveland who worked as an accountant at BP Oil downtown had this dream of owning his own business. He bought Pizza Den from the now ready to retire German/Italian couple. He also bought the rights to the pizza we've come to love!  Jim Paponetti now owns the greatest pizza on earth! I was now working there making the dough, the sauce and the very secret method for the Sausage. The ovens were a very important part of the process and how its cooked and the length of time you cook it was critical to the success of the pie.  Jim has since renamed the place Paponetti's he has expanded the place to a bar and catering, he has successfully immersed himself into the local community, he supports local causes and sports teams.  Jim has also kept the tradition of Pizza Den style pizza with the same ovens that often breakdown and Jim keeps them going, repairing them every time cause he knows the secret to a great pie! You must order them Well Done, everyone who goes here knows this most frequent and important request!  I've grown up and moved away, I get to Brook Park a couple times a year and next to seeing my family, I'm most excited to order my well done pie from Paponetti's and they never disappoint.  Thank you Paponetti's for the greatest pizza on earth and memories.  \"Hello Pizza Den\""}
