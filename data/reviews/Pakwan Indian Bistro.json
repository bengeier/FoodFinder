{"text":"The best fresh oven baked bread I ever had anywhere in AZ, if you want traditional food and bread in east valley, besides Persian Room, you should definitely check this place out. Chicken kababs, curries and etc. is phenomenal here! The food is like homemade and traditional, you would feel like you're sitting in a restaurant in Delhi, not on Chandler blvd lol"}
{"text":"This review is for the chicken Biryani which I ordered for a party (Full tray), it was absolutely delicious and everyone loved it. The restaurant went out of their way and agreed to deliver before their normal working hours. We wanted a non-spicy Biryani, and they made it exactly as per the instruction. People said it tasted home-made and were raving about the huge portion. Thank you so much for delivering a great quality Biryani."}
{"text":"Food is great here, pure authentic taste. Very generous on their portion but that will change in future for sure.  Not great restaurant ambiance but its ok.  Been there twice ever since they have opened up and will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Food was good which is why I'm leaving it at 2 stars, but I (and my husband) had food poisoning for three days straight. I have an iron stomach and can handle any spice, and additionally have never had food poisoning before."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their Haleem. Medium spicy is the way to go. I would say that this is the best haleem in town."}
{"text":"i would give ZERO stars if I could! SLOW AND UNORGANIZED!! If you're going for a quick lunch, reconsider! The food was good, till we were getting ready to leave and out \"lunch special\" cost 3x what it was supposed to because the person taking orders \"doesn't speak English well\" and put our order in wrong... It was also very warm inside the restaurant. I WOULD NEVER RETURN OR REFER ANYONE HERE!"}
{"text":"Disappointed by this place. Cashier recommended the biryani, and I went with the goat. First bite, bit down on something hard. It was a bone chunk. I pulled 9 huge pieces of bone out of my mouth, and I ate less than half of my dish. The rice was flavorful, but the goat was pretty awful. Every piece was gristly, fatty, chewy and had tendons.   Boyfriend's chicken tikka masala was okay, nothing special. Portion was very small compared to the large amount of biryani I was given. Garlic naan was also just okay.  Customer service was blah, the woman didn't even say hello back?"}
{"text":"The best butter chicken I have had since moving to Arizona! I also thought their garlic naan was amazing. Overall the food is simply fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best hidden true authentic Indian restaurant in chandler. I was quite surprised with the food they served. It is truly amazing and taste all herbs/spices in each dish. I will have to bring my friends here next time. The garlic na'an is perfect and Marsala is very good!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite Indian restaurant especially the non veg items. We come every week now! They also have really good south Indian food. Affordable as well!"}
{"text":"What a treat- South Indian Food! Come for the biryani. Disposable plates and utensils, but the flavors are delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a biryani.. goat biryani is my favorite.. and always awesome, they make all the spice over here from scratch. I am a regular here.. they also have good veg dishes.. I took my friends a group of 16 people and eveone ordered more than they would have at regular place and finished it all.. best place owner is always present.. and will for sure listen to what have to say, if any improvement needed he is open to suggestions.. nice place for late night weekend orders and takeout.."}
{"text":"Decided to try out Pakwan tonight and much to our surprise it was pretty good! We dined and the service was as expected. Though we have traveled to India and understand cultural differences the service we received was just fine. The place was clean and we ate a good meal. Our server brought us everything we asked for.  The food quality was great. Gobi manchurian was excellent,  tikka masala was good, butter chicken was good, and the biriyani was tasty.  Not the same as Paradise in Hyderabad but good. We will definitely be back to eat at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lamb biryani and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"So disappointed. When I heard Pakwan, I was relating it to the relating it to the amazing Pakwan Resturant in San Jose California. A Muslim living in the east valley it's damn near impossible to find a good halal joint, and I was hoping this was a gem.   Unfortunately, when we walked in, the atmoaphere was bleak, with only one frame on the wall and inappropriate Bollywood movies playing on a screen. We ordered the food & the lady behind the counter was nice, I could tell she was trying. The service was actually pretty good and the food came out quickly which I was very happy about.   Unfortunately what the food came out in was very very very disappointing. Plastic dixie bowls and styrofoam plates. It should be a crime for any resturant to do this. Mind you I was not getting take out, we sat and ate in the resturant. When I asked the nice lady for silverware she said they only have plastic forks and knives. This is one of their biggest fallbacks in my opinion. Plates and silverware is not a big ask.  The food was actually pretty good. The vegetable samosas were tasty as was the chicken tikka masala and the tandoori chicken. The naan was mediocre at best, didn't seem too fresh. The rice looked sad and bland however. But regardless of the good food the styrafoam threw the whole meal off.  A lot of potential, but very disappointing. If any of this changes, let me know because I would love to come back & give this place another shot."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for Indian food. We went here in a group of 6/7 people, at a pretty late hour, and ordered a ton of food. Their service was prompt and quite good. However, the quality of food could certainly be a lot better. The naan seemed stale and was not very soft. Their chicken dishes were pretty oily, and could've used better/different ingredients for flavor. A quick and fast place for average quality Indian food."}
{"text":"This place has never let me down! The quality and consistency is always on point. Today I had the fish curry and it was AMAZING! I'd had to say it is my new favorite. The first was cooked perfectly in a creamy curry sauce that was full of flavor. It's a steal at only $10. I'll probably get that from now on :)"}
{"text":"This place was a little disappointing. The food was definitely tasty & our server was super sweet, shes the owners daughter.  We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala & it was delicious, & it didn't have too much food coloring like many restaurants do. Also, it was cooked with boneless thigh meat which was a nice touch because it was super tender.  We also got the veggie samosas which my husband loved, and the garlic naan which was pretty good as well. Unfortunately, i have to give it three starts because of the quality. All the food was served in paper/styrofoam plates which really threw me off. My husbands super picky about stuff like that so he definitely did not enjoy after that. They only had plastic utensils.  I understand if this was a fast food restaurant, but it isnt. Youre meant to sit down and eat a meal there, and the plates and utensils really threw all of it off. . The food is great, but they really need to up their atmosphere. If you're gonna eat here, get it as takeaway & eat it at home.  I definitely recommend the Chicken Tikka Masala, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Just ordered take-out from here. The owners are incredibly friendly and answered all of our questions on the menu. My wife and I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, garlic naan, and a Paner Dosa. Both dishes were extremely well made and flavorful and came out in exactly 15 minutes as promised. Every restaurant's level of spiciness is different. We asked for a mild Chicken Tikka Masala and to our palette, it was more of a mild/medium (which was fine). But, just mentioning as a tip when ordering your level of spiciness.   This is a quintessential family restaurant and we highly recommend it for eat in or take out."}
{"text":"Tried goat Biriyani yesterday. It was pretty good but a little bit salty. Compared to other indian restaurants here in the Phoenix area Pakwan is pretty good. Will be trying again for sure. Thank you."}
{"text":"God bless these hyderabadi guys. Amazing food. Ordered - Mysore Bonda - Best ever mysore Bonda I ever tried in US. Cut mirchi stuffed- Serrano peppers, battered fried and topped with onions and peanuts. Loved it. Idly - 3 count for just $3.50. Chutneys are great. Veg Ulavacharu biryani - Best biryani ever. Better than paradise /bawarchi.  Updating review after my 3rd visit. Place needs to maintain lil hygiene in their restrooms."}
{"text":"Kids and I were looking for something new nearby for a quick lunch. We were pleasantly surprised by this gem. We tried 3 different curries and couldn't decide which was the favorite as we liked them all so much. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I hate to do this but I'm helpless. I wish I gave 0 stars.   The place looks old for a newly opened restaurant. We ordered a to go and when we entered there was a foul smell and the restaurant was empty. We should have guessed it from that how bad it is.   We ordered chicken 65 and mutton curry with naan. Chicken 65 had so much of food color that I was forcing myself to eat it. The taste was bland, jus some chicken covered in food color fried. Mutton curry was so salty I had to drink water all day to get rid of the sodium. The naan was Burnt floating in oil.   It costed us $20, such a waste of money. The food is horrible, they can't cook for crying out loud.   Ps: my husband had food poisoning. Please avoid this place and this is an honest review."}
{"text":"I tried multiple items in the menu at this restaurant. I find the chicken biriyani to be amazing."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here. My chana masala looked like chickpeas swimming in curdled milk. I didn't even have a bite, it went straight into the trash. Medu vada were fried well but had a strange flavor. Onion biryani portion could be sufficient at 1/4 of what was in the box.   My boyfriend said that his \"meat\" samosas (What kind of meat? Who knows) weren't good and his butter chicken was bland and not at all spicy. We both woke up feeling a tinge of food poisoning, too.   In the future we'll skip Pakwan and make the drive to The Dhaba."}
{"text":"Thought to try this place out for the first time so got to-go order of goat masala, chicken seekh kabab and garlic naan.hugely disssapointed, they made goat curry and chicken kababs unexpectedly too salty and naan was burnt/over cooked.I immediately called them up to complain and response for salty goat curry was that \"We make it in huge quantity\", what does that even mean and how is that an excuse or justification for salty food. Such a waste of money, this place is so not upto expectations at all!"}
{"text":"Tell it pure luck or a great find but we end up here while looking for a good biryani. We ordered chicken 65 biryani and chicken biryani. Place was clean and  staff was friendy. Both biryani's had an authentic taste and was very tasteful. I like it better than paradise biryani point. My husband enjoyed it throughly and it satisfied his craving for good biryani. Will definitely recommend it to anyone who loves & craves for good biryani."}
{"text":"The food was good- Chicken 65 is always the best. Really glad to have a halal option in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Food is delicious.pakwan special biryani has a unique authentic flavor which you dong find in any other Indian restaurants . Andhra chepala pulusu is the best .  Great food !keep it up."}
{"text":"This place fantastic.    They tout themselves as having the best curry in the valley and I would have to say that I can't disagree.     I had the veg korma which had rich flavor that is hard to describe.    The people I was with had the chic tikka masala which was every bit as satisfying.   Mom and pop feel to this place which adds to its appeal for me.    It's a recommend for me."}
{"text":"The chicken, goat curries are the things you need to order here. Don't order biryani's it is not worth it. Their fish fry was good. I didn't try their buffet but I heard it was alright. The curries were more close to the South Indian cooking style, so expect more oil."}
{"text":"BEWARE!  What started out as a seemingly normal Indian dinning experience quickly turned into the most horrific culinary experience of my life... I really wanted to like this place but sadly I have nothing but awful things to say about this establishment. I think I'm developing PTSD just thinking about the meal we received, but enough with the jokes, let fill you in on the details that matter... We started out our dinner with a mixed pakora which was super greasy but had a good flavor. For the main course we decided to try out the lamb korma and the chicken tika masala... this is where it all went horribly wrong... when the korma arrived at our table it smelled rancid... the smell will forever be etched into my memory. The chicken in the tika masala was pink, and I'm not talking just a little pink... it was raw. Needless to say, if you value your health please take caution when choosing to dine here."}
{"text":"I visited Pakwan rwstaueant yesterday.They opened one day ago.The interior is decent enough to dine in.  Ordered mutton biriyani, and Andhra chicken curry. The biriyani was authentic and flavorful. I especially liked the kata gravy they gave along with the biriyani. The chicken curry was spot on.  The prices are reasonable and even the food quantity was good.  Hope they maintain the same taste and quality."}
{"text":"I love this place! Me and my hubby comes here few times a month. I love their special Pakwan biryani. It can get too spicy so make sure you request to be just mild spicy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was not great. Chicken kabab was too hard and rubbery. Chicken tikka masala was average. Biryani was decent. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Tasty place. First time trying biryani with Masala. Good flavors. Palak paneer thumbs up."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  Lots of flavor and even some heat.  The archana chicken had a ton of flavor.  The rice was also delicious.  They even had spicy lemon achar which were delicious.    The service was friendly.  The space needs some work, as do the paper/plastic-ware.  I'd like more than a plastic spoon in a paper bowl.  Please."}
{"text":"Today a new item showed up on the specials menu: Drums of Heaven aka \"lollipops\". They are incredible! Onions and both breast/dark meat rolled up into a ball and loaded with flavor. I can definitely count myself as a regular and highly recommend trying it out. This item came about from customer requests so just ask!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant last week to check out what specials this place can offer..As soon as we entered, my friend spotted mutton paya on the today's special board. I could not stop myself as I am a big lover of goat and lamb meat. We ordered dosas and chicken biriyani along the paya First came dosas with roti pachadi and coconut chutney.. roti pachadi was so yummy that we finished off half of our dosas before he could get the sambar and paya.. seriously guys roti pachadi was worth selling in a jar.. Then the paya.. delicious.. right amount of spice and heat.. good proportion.. I had a big smile on my face when I finished off my dosa with it Then came the biriyani. It was not bad but not the best in town"}
{"text":"Most awesome biryani especially mutton. If you are a fan of quality food you should try this restaurant. I have had the most awesome bonda, biryani and samosa. I should stress on the chutney they give , they are simply scrumptious. Definitely a must try. Customer service is also top notch."}
{"text":"Horrid customer service. There seems to be no appreciation for customers taking time out of their day to frequent this establishment. If servicing customers when literally no one else is at the restaurant is an issue I guess I'll take my business to the other Indian cuisine restaurant down the street.   I'd recommend to others to do the same."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've had thus far. We ordered chili paneer as an appetizer and shared cashew curry and shrimp biryani. The whole time I was praying that god would send me an extra stomach so I could eat more once I was full. It is a little weird that they use disposable dish ware, however the service is good, the food is fantastic and I think it's a true hidden gem. If you come here be sure to wear your yoga pants for maximum food consumption."}
{"text":"Best chai  Very nice and friendly. The food is yummy as well.  Good place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Expensive and mediocre Indian food, small portions.  Pass on this one."}
{"text":"Amazing briyani that is full of flavor and spice. Pakwan special briyani is the hands down favorite so far. Curry dishes are also great.  Lots to choose from and try.  Service is a bit slow but the family is very nice and the focus is on the food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted some Indian food the other day and decided to try this place out and were glad we did!!! They have tons of different food options and we decided on the veggie samosas and pakwan briyani and was not disappointed! The food took a little longer than expected, but was well worth it! The chicken serving was huge and so worth it!   The staff was really friendly and accommodating and we for sure will be going there again. Think the place has only been open for about a week and hope they continue to grow! Highly recommended!!!"}
