{"text":"Disappointing. As written about online (Toronto Life Best New Sandwiches #2), this sandwich did not come as advertised.

Although the porchetta was delicious, the meat to bread ratio was quite low. The sandwich did not come with the apricot mostarda or pickled onions that are described, only a heavy handed amount of an ailoi and a tomato based sauce.

I watched as the person making my sandwich dropped most of the cracklins that were supposed to go in my sandwich onto the floor as he put the two halves of the sandwich together. 

A sloppy oversauced mushy mess."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and was totally disappointed.  The Caesar salad was mostly bread.  I ordered the chicken sandwich which also was mostly bread.  It looked nothing like the pic.  There was a few shreds of chicken with mostly tomato sauce....no basil, was there supposed to be cheese?  If so, nowhere to be found.  ...and with a pop it came to over $17 dollars!!!!!!   So not worth it, do not spend your money here.  Go around the corner to Flock."}
{"text":"Had the porchetta sandwich and it tasted good, but boy the bread was soaked in grease. Not a big fan of that. For the prices that Carver charges, they could at least put a little more meat in the sandwich. Addons are pretty pricy too. I won't be going back as I can't justify paying so much for a simple sandwich. You can get this type of food elsewhere for a much better deal and for decent quality."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, it's close to home and work, and I would be more forgiving if it was a brand new concept, but apparently they have been around for decades, likely outside Toronto, or in the burbs.

The first experience was pretty good, excellent chicken sandwich, but the baked potato was terrible. If one is going to peddle baked potatoes for almost $6, they should use a potato that is a baking varietal; of course that would lower the profit margin drastically.  

The second time around, very poor, I went on a Monday and it seemed the chicken was cooked a couple of days ago. They are open on weekends, but perhaps they don't get the lineups.

Third time is the charm right? Unfortunately not, I had the porchetta, and I think the cutting board was overflowing in fat.  So the bottom slice of focaccia is swimming in fat, I wiped it off as best as I could. The sandwich was pretty good but how can you enjoy it when you know you're ingesting lots of calories that didn't have to be there.

These guys should get their act together, there's lots of competition in the nabe. Personally it may be winter before I try Carver again. King and Portland is a bit of hike, but the fries are amazing as are the Porchetta  & chicken sandwiches there."}
{"text":"Carver used to be one of my favourite restaurants in the neighborhood, but recently the quality has suffered a lot. They no longer do their patatas bravas, which was a highlight of their menu, and their new bowls leave a lot to be desired. Their lemon tajine rice is dry and overcooked, and their bowls, while packed with flavour, lack balance. Their chicken is still super juicy and tender, but now the dishes that go with the chicken are sup bar. Not sure I'll be visiting as often now, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Meat sandwich. Yup. The porchetta was very tasty, and seemingly not too heavy on the fat (which is kind of remarkable). This is belied by the amount of grease that was left in the bag (staggering). You've got to be ok with that - and I am. 

The bread is worth mentioning, lightly toasted and warm, almost buttery - complements the porchetta perfectly. 

Definitely worth at least a first try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Small take out place for sandwiches. I tried it once and I don't think I'll try it again. The sandwiches aren't bad but it's not really my taste. I had the pork sandwich which had a lemony type of sauce. I generally don't like lemon in savoury foods, after a few bites it was overwhelming. At the same time I noticed some European cuisines use similar flavours so it could just not be my preference. The sandwich itself was rather oily so I was a bit disappointed hoping for a healthy dinner. That being said it's not too bad, there was plenty of meat in the sandwich. If you're okay with above mentioned, you'll probably enjoy it. The price is average."}
{"text":"I always stop in when I'm in the area. Love this sandwich spot, the ingredients are fresh and gourmet and so so tasty. The bread also melts in my mouth. 

Big fan just finding parking can be hard but if you are going to a Blue Jays game or anything at the sky some drop on by for one of the most mouthwatering sandwiches on the planet!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Porchetta & Co house special so I was really excited to try Carver. Went in for lunch, greeted by friendly staff. Easy menu to figure out what you want.

Had the porchetta sandwich as it comes, bread was a flatbread with herbs from the Drake which was really soft and nice (change up from the typical bun style), meat was moist but the toppings were a bit too sweet...I'm more of a savoury sandwich eater! Glad I tried it, but simply because I'm a savoury sandwich eater, I would choose Porchetta & Co over this spot. Definitely worth a try!

What I would change - more savoury flavour, more crackling, more additional toppings (such as mustards, cheeses). 

No eat in spots so plan for take away."}
{"text":"I had no clue what the heck a porchetta was and I am still not sure but walking back from the gym one day I popped in to check the menu and the temptation was strong.

I went for the focaccia chicken sandwich which if I now recall mentioned something about \"drake\" on the menu. Maybe I imagined that but I rarely imagine crap pop artists. 

For under $10 it does not fill you up but that what burritos are for no?

It is a take out place, so I got home and unwrapped it and let the smalls waft into my nasal cavity. The bread by now had portions of it slightly saturated with the fat from the meat so expect greasy fingers. 

After taking my first bite I was a fan, I was at first suspicious about mixing up apricot jam with mustard and meat but damn that actually worked. Like I said the sandwich did not fill me up but for less than $10 and for the yummy factor I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Little torn here. Got the porcetta sandwich and the sauce and toasted focaccia bread were very tasty. But this is a $10 sandwich (incl taxes) and the amount of roasted pork is tiny! Barely can taste it. As you can see in other reviews, this appears to be a common complaint so I really hope that Carver can up the protein content (which would totally make this a 4* place). Really, pork is one of the cheapest of meats so this really shouldn't cut into their margins. 

As it stands now, like-for-like the tried and true Porcetta & Co. is cheaper by a few bucks for the same tastiness so I'd probably head a few blocks west for that one instead."}
{"text":"Guys- Avocado Caesar salad. It's a real thing and it's over here at Carver. 

I really don't have to write anything else because this should entice you enough to come here. But just incase you need some more.... I got the 5oz porchetta plate which came with the elusive salad along with a really tasty potato salad. For the price I was a bit skeptical ( around 15 all in) but I actually got two meals out of one. 

Just a note! There's no seating so grab and go friends!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meat lovers place. Various roasts cooked to perfection and served up any way you like it. I had it plain with a baked potato, the salads looked great but I felt like carbs. This place is a winner for sure unfortunately I'm not in the area often. Writing on my smart phone, will add more later."}
{"text":"Great food always happy staff!!
Love going here, they make amazing chicken sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Very good. Love the focaccia bread and I didn't think the sauce was too sweet as others have said. A nice compliment to the salty porchetta. The smashed potatoes were well seasoned and the sour cream a good classic combination.

What I'd change: more crackle on the sandwich 

Bonus: Rob Baragnolo himself made me my sandwich!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the porchetta sandwich after walking by this place a million times. 
The sandwich comes piping hot. Served in an amazing focaccia, the porchetta sandwich is absolutely delicious. It's tender and flavourful with a bit of a crunch in it. The sauce is really tasty and not overly sweet. The fresh Rosemary was a  nice touch but a bit heavy handed. Overall a delicious sandwich. I'll have to go back and try the chicken at some point. 

I absolutely recommend you try the porchetta."}
{"text":"Carver is a small quick service sandwich shop on Peter Street that specializes in slow roasted meats. There's zero seating to be spoken of, so plan where you're going to be eating your sandwich so you can experience the freshest version of it possible.

I had a chance to try their chicken sandwich and the porchetta sandwich. All of their sandwiches seem to be served with their winner drake focaccia bread, which is an Italian bread that has a crispy outer layer that gives way to a fluffy, yet still slightly crisp, interior. For both of the sandwiches, it's a wonderful choice of bread. The chicken sandwich comes with lemon aioli, roasted tomato pesto, and basil, plus I added bacon. The porchetta sandwich comes with red pepper pesto, salsa verde aioli, and a crackle crumble, plus I ordered it with cheese. If I had to pick a favourite, the porchetta sandwich takes it. The porchetta is great, the red pepper pesto sets off the savoury meter, and the crackle crumble gives it some added deliciousness.

These are obviously sandwiches made with care, fresh-to-def ingredients, and convenience for the customer on the go. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Good concept but bad execution. Tiny portion size, ordered the Indian spiced bowl with half pork half chicken. In what tiny amount (probably 2oz) of meat came, 3/4 was fat. Need to go out and get a whole other lunch. Too bad as it is right by my office. Save your money and go to flock around the corner. Not good, very disappointing"}
{"text":"I have gone to this place a number of times because I work in the area. I love their porchetta sandwich!Although, one time it was a little off, so 1 star off for only that one experience. It is great for when you are craving something hearty for lunch. Recently, I tried their porchetta plate and it has instilled a newfound love for this place! Great value for this much quality food and the perfect balance of perfectly cooked porchetta, seasoned rice, and salad."}
{"text":"We had one chicken one porchetta platter and both with bacon and cheese. The bacon was ready-crisp style Sysco bacon, the cheese was a slice of white processed American cheese. The potatoes were nice and greasy but basically unseasoned and the amount of porchetta was small and the amount of crackling was negligible. Apparently the 90's hip hop and specialty focus eatery isn't a foolproof formula in Toronto. You can screw it up just like any other good idea."}
{"text":"I have had the porchetta plate. It is good to fill you up! Not much seating space in there. Actually none. They have got a stand up bar to chow down at. They do not take long to make the food.

The rice is lemony which is great with the porchetta. Salad along with their dressing is very nice. Cant go into their flavour too much because I ate it really fast but I can say I will come back for more!"}
{"text":"Located just north of Adelaide and Peter St, Carver provides another grab and go lunch option in the area. The smell of roasting meats is intoxicating as you walk by, beckoning you to go inside. 

I tried the porchetta sandwich and the kale krunch salad and was frankly a bit disappointed. The porchetta sandwich came on a soft foccacia made by The Drake which was a nice complement to the meat. However, I found that the quantity of meat was a bit lacking, and the apricot sauce was overpowering. The salad was a fairly standard quinoa salad (which could have used more of the namesake kale) with chick peas and an avocado dressing. It was a decent salad, but didn't have any particular standout qualities. 

The cost was standard for the area, with Flock and Buna's Kitchen being comparable options. While the porchetta itself was good, the sandwich doesn't really compare to the monster which is Porchetta and Co's house special."}
{"text":"I ordered through ritual expecting a higher class of lunch food considering what I was paying. That's more or less what i got. The chicken sandwich was very tasty and the bread was amazing. I would get that again on it's own. I also ordered an \"avocado Caesar salad\". Where wss the avocado? Ground up into the dressing? What is this AVOCADO FOR ANTS?"}
{"text":"The hours on yelp say closes at 9pm... really closes at 8.  I would have planned accordingly had I known.  Not really sure if this is restaurants fault but I don't know where else to report this"}
{"text":"First, I would like to say that this place did not answer their phone so I could pre-order--I called and had to sit through an extremely long message that eventually told me to download ritual.  Extremely annoying.

I went there and ordered the chicken sandwich.  Unfortunately it was really unappetizing. 

By the time I ate it (5 minutes after it was made), the whole thing was soggy.  The sandwich had a chicken bone in it, several tendons, and some pieces of meat that were dry.  Finally there was way too much bread compared to meat and toppings.  I ate half of it but was grossed out and couldnt finish it.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Carver is right in the area where I live on Peter street.   It's a great takeout sandwich joint (no seating).  It's got a clean atmosphere and very high ceilings.  Their shop menu wall is reminiscent of the hipster sandwich shops in SF....and I like that about it.   It also has the same mantra, slow cooked, naturally raised meats....all the great hipster lingo.   

As for their sandwiches, the first one I tried was their Porchetta sandwich with roasted red pepper pesto, salsa verdi aioli, crackle crumble, and added cheese and bacon.   It was pretty darn good.....though with the pesto and the aioli, I didn't get to enjoy the porchetta as much as I would've liked.  The crackle crumble was more like little squares.  The toasted focaccia bread (the sandwich is toasted in a sandwich press before they give it to you....is really soft with a nice chew and a crispy outside.   

I've still yet to find a sandwich place that does porchetta sandwiches the way Roli Roti makes it in San Francisco, but I don't think anyone else would put in 1/2 a pound of meat in a sandwich to charge 9.50 USD...so that's not entirely a fair comparison.  If you ever go to SF though and want to ultimate porchetta sandwich....go to the ferry building on Saturday morning and get that sandwich!  

The 2nd sandwich I tried was their chicken sandwich with charred lemon Aioli with Tomato pesto , fresh basil, and we added cheese and bacon.   It was a tad smaller then I would've liked (it looked smaller then the Porchetta sandwich)....but the flavours were great.   The bread was a nice chewy and soft focaccia as well....so you can enjoy your lunch without it being a chewing exercise.  :-)

All their meats is naturally raised which is really important to me.   I get migraines with any sort of antibiotics or preservatives so it's nice to have a lunch that makes me feel good afterwards.   I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this as a quick and healthy takeout lunch spot."}
{"text":"Always pass by this place on my way to work and my hubby and I stopped in for a late lunch. 

I see people are complaining about price and I can understand, but the quality is quite good. I got the chicken Caesar salad and my husband got a sandwich. The salad had a really yummy avocado dressing and was very filling. The chicken was so moist and not at all dry. My husband liked his sandwich but didn't love the apricot jam too much. 

All in all, good place to eat :)"}
{"text":"$21 for two sandwiches. The chichen was not good, porchetta even worse. Greasy.. Wife and I felt gross afterwards, disgusting after taste, way too expensive. 
Did not like."}
{"text":"Saw this place on the star and when we walked by, said sibling said it smelled good.  I decided to give it a try.

For this review, i will omit my usual observations and get straight to the food.  We ordered the carver, its a mashed potato with porchetta, tomato cutney and aiolo, some seasoning, green onions and herbs.  Then we ordered a chicken sandwich.

We asked that the samdwich be cut in half, but when we received it, it wasnt cut.  The sandwich was very greasy.  Like the type of greasy oily tomato sandwich you get from a pizza place.  Also, it was reslly salty.  If they did a. Sodium content for this must be a days worth at least.

I dont like foccacia bread, but it had a nice crunch to it.  This samdwich would be better on a crusty bread.


The carver potato was alright.  It was also very salty, like are they trying to hide the flavour in the salt, salty.

Its hipster for sure.  Two items was $19, not worth it as there wasnt much chicken in the sandwich and the carver potato was small."}
{"text":"I come here semi-regularly for the kale salad with chicken on top. The salad is fresh and crunchy (with grape tomatoes and mixed seeds) and the dressing is quite delicious. The chicken on top, which should be the star, is hit and miss. When it's good, it's amazing.  When it's not good, it's slimey and hard to get through. If the chicken were always good, I'd give this place 5 stars, no question. But it's not always good, and I haven't figured out how to predict when it will be edible."}
{"text":"Pretty bland, a little over priced.  Much better options in this genre near by.  Limited menu."}
{"text":"I work just around the corner from here and was excited when I saw that there was a sandwich shop like this opening up in the area. I love a good porchetta sandwich.

I decided to pop in today for lunch. I've seen it get very busy in there so I went a little early to avoid a long wait. I got in, the place smelled good, and I decided on the porchetta sandwich special with a side and a drink. I opted for the kale crunch salad instead of the potatoes, which added $1 to my total (though the sides are both the same price on the menu). The grand total after tax came to about $16.50, which I find very expensive for a lunch time salad and sandwich combo.

The sandwich tasted fine. As others have mentioned, I would have preferred more meat in the sandwich as it was lacking a little bit. The toppings were fine to me. I didn't find it too sweet or overpowering as others have said. However, I definitely would have like more crackle on my sandwich. I didn't feel any crunch when biting into my sandwich, which is a big no no when it comes to porchetta sandwiches for me. The salad was just alright. There wasn't a ton of kale in there as the name would suggest.

All in all, I probably wouldn't go back here. There are plenty of other delicious and affordable options in the area and unfortunately I don't think this one makes the cut unless they make some changes."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 sandwiches: the signature porchetta and the chicken sandwich. Both sandwich was over $20! ridiculous! The portion size is pretty big but i don't feel like its worth a $10 sandwich. The chicken sandwich was just ok but the porchetta one was even worst. When I got home to eat it (no more than 10 mins later), the bottom of each sandwich was soaked in grease/oil. So oily that the paper bag was almost clear. I had to eat it with a can of Coke AND chug another Coke after, just to help my stomach digest all that grease/oil. Also, my hands were covered in oil. 

Totally disappointed after walking/driving by here multiple times. Will never come back here again."}
{"text":"I had the indian lime wrap, and it was delicious. 
Punchy flavors (tomato paste, spices, basil) and a really nice roasted chicken inside.

There are no seats though, so this is definitely a take-out joint."}
{"text":"The average: I usually start my review with the good about a place but I set this place just at average. I ordered the porchetta sandwich and it's not great but not too bad either. 

The bad: perhaps what was getting to me was paying a premium for a so called premium sandwich. I wasn't truly impressed, I mean it's good to fill you up but didn't justify the amount that I paid for. Too many great takeout places around the area before giving this place a try.

The ugly: nothing too ugly here

Neutral: no seating, purely a takeout joint."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich is a MUST. Bread is fluffy and sauce is just right, lots of chosen in sandwich, always want more after I finish."}
{"text":"I didn't know about porchetta until I watched an Anthony Bourdain episode of Toronto. I wasn't sure if this place was good. It was near our airbnb condo and we were so hungry. My brother ordered the sandwich and we took it back to the condo to eat. This place is more an order for to go or call for pick up. There were no seats but I think there was a table to stand and eat. The sandwich was so good! I liked how the bread and the meat were so tasty. A bit greasy but just enough of it to enjoy. I really don't know how porchetta sandwiches are supposed to taste like but this one kept me wanting to bite more and more of it. I'm glad we shared because it is filling for me. I would be a reoccurring customer if I lived near here."}
{"text":"Staff are attentive and friendly, food always tastes fresh. The chicken sandwich is my favorite thing to get. The bread is fantastic and everything else is always flavorful. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Carver is a neat little sandwich/salad shop on Peter St. The menu here is focused on two types of meat sandwiches, served on focaccia. Meals come with salad/drink, or you can get salad on its own ($6-12). 

There's definitely a visual theme running through this small standing room-only takeout spot, and it has to do with 'The Six' and your woes (hint: images of Drake's likeness on the wall). One of the owner's is apparently a graphic designer turned restaurateur, so kudos on the branding. It's clean and modern in here, with bright menus and logos that contrast well with the exposed concrete and glass.

Must-try items:
Chicken Sandwich
Potato Salad

The meats here are prepared and slow cooked for hours at a time, which locks in the flavour. Carver sources grain-fed, free run poultry from a farm just outside of Toronto. At $8.49 for the chicken sandwich (make it a meal for $13.99), it's definitely worth it. Focaccia bread can be hit and miss, but the bread here goes very well with the sandwich (I did not find mine greasy at all).

The potato salad is creatively done, with crunchy pumpkin seeds and fresh cherry tomatoes among the ingredients. Their salad/baked potato lineup looks very appetizing. I found the presentation of the food and branding quite impressive. The meal will fill you, but you'll still have room for a snack or dessert afterwards. This is definitely a welcome addition to the entertainment district."}
{"text":"We ordered Carver's last night on UberEATS and was surprised at how quickly they were able to get our meal to our door. Max. 15 minutes and we had the food at our doorstep. We ordered the Porchetta Plate with lemon Tajine rice. It was nicely put together and the flavours were strong, but the portion was so small. Another scoop of rice wouldn't have hurt as it felt like half of it had stuck to the bottom of the take out container. It's never a good thing if you're still hungry after eating an $18 meal (tip and delivery). I would consider trying their sandwiches but not their plates due to the small portions."}
{"text":"The 'avocado' kale cesear is a complete rip off. 

First, there is no avocado in the avocado kale cesear (suprised? so was I!) technically there is avocado in the dressing. There is also a paltry amount of kale or romaine. It essentially is one of those pre-made side salads you could get next store at City market for 4 dollars, but all for the price of 11.50!

Carver's sandwiches are also overpriced but at least they are filling. I'm now going out to buy a second lunch because of how little food there actually was. 

Pass on carver, do your wallet and your stomach a favor."}
{"text":"I was walking back to the financial district from a client meeting and popped in to get a late lunch. I had the porchetta sandwich with the Tuscan potato salad.  The sandwich was awesome. The focaccia was incredible and the pork had the perfect amount of crackling.  The potato salad was also very good. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a quick lunch during TIFF and remembered that I'd never tried Carver before. The joint was empty, so we quickly ordered two sandwiches to share:

Porchetta (Roasted Red Pepper Pesto, Salsa Verde Aioli, Crackle Crumble, Drake Foccacia) and Chicken (Charred Lemon Aioli, Roast Tomato Pesto, Fragrant Basil, Drake Foccacia): I'll admit that these are both incredibly flavorful sandwiches, with the various sauces and aiolis on both working together beautifully.

However, the restaurant skimps on the meat. These tasted more like sauce sandwiches than chicken/porchetta sandwiches, as the protein felt like an afterthought. The fresh but very plain bread also stands out (ie couldn't they toast it just a little bit?)

I'll admit that I enjoyed eating these sandwiches purely based on the intense flavors, but given that I'm paying $10 a 'wich, I really felt a little ripped off in terms of meat."}
{"text":"Had the porchetta plate with lemon rice and a kale salad (at least there was kale in it). I prefer when the pork skin is roasted versus fried but the pork was still nice and the addition of the tomato sauce is good with the rice and pork."}
