{"text":"Only been here once so far, but the food was great and the portions were large.  Got the Stonebowl Bi-Bim-Bop, which came with miso soup, and was stuffed to the brim when I left.  The sauce that was out for the Bi-Bim-Bop was supposedly spicy, but I dumped a ton on  my dish and barely felt the heat, though it was flavorful.  You can get their varieties of meats (and now tofu) as a \"bowl\" with rice, or as a \"tray\" with rice, noodles, and a salad.  My friend got the tray, and that thing was huge!  The burrito that somebody else got was so-so for the price, but was still tasty.  There is radish kimchi for free at the counter...I wasn't a fan...and they have to-go boxes out for the taking, as the \"trays\" could easily serve as two meals.  I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Spoonhouse is a regular spot for a lunch with my coworkers.  I won't speak to the authenticity of the food as I am not a Korean food expert, but it is always very tasty!   I usually stick with the traditional beef bulgogi, but my coworkers have enjoyed the tacos as well.  Even when it's extremely busy (almost always) they get the food out to you fairly quickly.  My only complaint is that it is a little pricey at around $8 for a dish.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Terrible attitude. They ALWAYS give the wrong order! After the third time they gave me the wrong dish, I pointed out, they suggested i didn't say clearly! Their food is not cheap either, plus the horrible attitude, good luck if you choose to come here."}
{"text":"I went to Spoon House three times this past semester, and the thing that brings me back every time is their Korean tacos. I had Korean tacos for the first time a year ago, in LA, the home of Korean-Mexican fusion. Despite being two thousand miles away, Spoon House's tacos are definitely good enough to compete with those on the west coast. To know my knowledge, they're the only restaurant in town that serves such a dish; they're both delicious and reasonably-priced, which adds to their good reputation. 

Go for the beef bulgogi taco and the spicy chicken taco, those are the two best. Personally, I feel that they are too heavy to be eaten exclusively as a meal, so you're best off ordering a small rice or noodle dish with several tacos on the side, so it's easier on the stomach. I would avoid the quesadillas, the saltiness overwhelmed the taste of the meat. 

I can't really speak for the rest of the menu, but those tacos are quite a gem."}
{"text":"I just had my first visit to Spoon House and I really enjoyed my experience. The owner came out from behind the counter and explained everything very well. I asked for his recommendation on what to order as it was my first time. I had the Beef Bulgogi quesadilla and I thought it was very tasty. I mentioned to the owner that I like spicy food and he brought me out a piece of the spicy pork quesadilla on the house which was also very tasty.

One reviewer mentioned they didn't have Kimchi but when I was there they had little styrofoam containers with Kimchi sitting to the right on the counter for free. I had some and also thought this was tasty as well.

It's super clean and very nice on the inside. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu and will recommend it to other people."}
{"text":"I love the tofu burritos here and the bubble tea is pretty solid. The burritos include sweet and spicy tofu, cilantro (optional), rice, cheese, lettuce, and other veggies. Personally, I think the flavor combinations is great and the burrito is huge (so I always get two meals out of it). 

My friends and I have all had good experiences with the Korean-Mexican fusion dishes. I've heard mixed reviews of the other items including the bi-bim-bap, but I'm not an expert on Korean food, so I'm not factoring that into this review. 

I like the space and decorations in Spoon House. However, it is slightly pricier than other establishments on Green Street and I've had experiences where my food can take a bit longer than I would expect."}
{"text":"I find this place much better than the 3/5 rating it currently has. The food is good, and they usually have it ready pretty fast. Prices are good. Unlike a lot of places around campus, it's not very crowded here. That might be because a lot of people don't like it, but I come here quite often for lunch."}
{"text":"Great tofu tacos and bi bin bop and that's saying a lot for this town. Good atmosphere and consistent food. Great place to grab lunch or dinner! My son loves the tacos too and he's usually a picky eater."}
{"text":"I don't know why my review was filtered. I was merely truthful. I will try to be nice now: this was one of the truly worst food experiences I've ever been through. In our generous (and food-wise varied) Urbana-Champaign, I can only think of Great Impasta (POST-change of place/owner) that offered food as bad as this one. The amount of salt (and/or MSG) used makes the food to border on inedible. A bad sign was that there wasn't one Korean person inside, only Caucasians. I should have known better."}
{"text":"Not bad, but there are better options nearby. I like Arirang a little better, and Woori-Jib even more. There are better places a bit further away like K-bowl, which I highly recommend, and Star Karaoke which is in Savoy.

I come here primarily for two dishes: Bibim nyang myun, and the crispy spicy chicken both of which are pretty good. Prices are a bit high, but they have introduced some cheaper dishes recently. The major complaint I have is with the fruit flies. Winter, summer...whenever, they're always there flying around you. No other place on campus has this problem. I counted 5 of them on the wall right next to me the last time I ate here, and usually I have to swat them away several times while I eat. Not a major problem for some, but it's an issue for me."}
{"text":"I was told the Jja Jang Myun was good.
It was not.

The instant ones they sell in the Asian supermarkets taste infinitely better.
I need to try other dishes, but I'm scared to try after that bad dish. So 2 stars works for me until friends drag me back."}
{"text":"I have had multiple dishes here at Spoon House and all of them were tasty. Their selection is huge and the food is always consistent. The service is friendly and I have never had a problem with their staff. If you compare other Korean restaurants to Spoon House, Spoon House is one of the better ones. Portions are fairly large though.

No restaurant is without its cons. Spoon House is not necessarily cheap. Most places around Green are kind of expensive though. (Excluding Mashawi Grill) If there is a lunch rush, expect delays.

Other than that, I'd recommend Spoon House for at least a try. What compelled me to write a review for Spoon House was my quest to find a new place to eat which had me stumble upon the Spoon House reviews. Most reviews are kind of trash because a lot of people in the world are whiny and high maintenance. My review is surely unbiased because I don't eat at Spoon House regularly and I have eaten at a huge variety of varieties on Green and downtown Champaign. I would not go out of my way to eat here though, only to what is close enough for the most part."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. That's what matters. From the time you step in the door until you are served your mouth will be watering. It is the best Korean restaurant on campus. All the foods are affordable too. I would 100% recommend this place to everyone. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"We've been going here for a few weeks now and have been absolutely devouring the tofu tacos, bi-bim-bop, and the tofu quesadilla. This place has a nice atmosphere, quick service, seems clean, and the food is yummy in every way. If you're seeking good veggie chow in C-U and don't always want to have lunch in the basement of a church, this could be the place for you."}
{"text":"Gosh...I tried it once, ordered the ramen thinking it was going to be actual ramen. Instead I got Shin ramen (Korean ramen that comes in packages), with some onions in it...I was so upset. It came with this Korean sushi that was basically rice, radish, and bologna. That cost 8 dollars. The bag ramen is worth 1 dollar. My friend tried the bulgogi tacos and they were not good. They were greasy and not very delicious. I do not recommend at all."}
{"text":"In response to Thomas B. :
The typical sauce used in bibimbap is not Sriracha. Its main ingredient is kochujang, which is a red pepper paste that is prevalent in Korean cooking. Many Korean cooks have their own personal recipes for making that particular sauce. My mother uses sesame oil, sprite, fresh garlic, and other ingredients.
Also, I believe Spoon House is following the trend on the West coast of putting Korean-style prepared meats into typically Mexican fare, such as burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. As such, the name bulgogi burrito is not offensive. 

My personal experiences at Spoon House have not been that great. Ddukbokki is one of my favorites, and I was slightly disappointed by their version. The dish had less heat and more sweetness than I cared for. I also did not care for their yukgaejang. The kimchi that was available on my first visit was watered down and bland, but was improved on my second visit. The bulgogi quesadilla, however, was pretty tasty, and I enjoy their bright colorful interior. 

Overall, I would go elsewhere for Korean cuisine, but would come back for Spoon House's burritos and quesadillas."}
{"text":"Tried this place out twice, and both times I was severely disappointed.

First time I tried the food it was horrible. I tried out their noodle dishes and they tasted bland like water. I think Arirang, Woorijib, and Bab Plus nearby serve much better food than this.

Second time I visited here I didn't even get my food for an hour. When I asked at the counter what was taking so long they said they already served my food. They never even called out my number or showed my number on the display above the counter. I complained to the manager about this and he tried to play it off as though someone had taken my food by accident, and the cashier tried to put the blame on me for not paying attention. Absolutely ridiculous! I was there alone and watching the display to show my number and it never did! The cashier never called out the number either. I demanded a refund which they were prompt about, but I am never going to go back there again.

Worst Korean fusion restaurant in Urbana. Go eat elsewhere for better food and better service. The manager at Arirang calls out the number in a prompt manner, and the food tastes much better at Woorijib."}
{"text":"I moved out of town recently and, on a return trip, got spoon house. it was so effing good and I'm reviewing it primarily to boost its yelp rating. it very much deserves a rating higher than 3-stars. I tend to get the tofu tacos, which are totally super good. fun fusion!"}
{"text":"I have not ventured out past the burritos and tacos, but both are great.  The food is cooked to order, but in my opinion worth the wait.  I usually go with the beef bulgogi burrito.  Great flavors and very filling."}
{"text":"Food was quit filling, 
Eatable , good price for the amount!!!
Chicken burrito and beef burrito"}
{"text":"Interesting concept! I LOVE THE BULGOGI BURRITO. When I crave one, I crave one and i need to have it! The jap chae isn't all that great. Ramen with cheese? Will someone tell me what that tastes like? (How revolutionary.... ) Regular bulgogi was alright. I'd give it a B. 

GO HERE. It's a definite must try! A quick meal and very casual."}
{"text":"Was once one of the best quick lunch spots on Green street. The location is good and prices were reasonable, but in recent times, the prices have gone up and I do not think that the new prices are justified for the food that is served. Quality of food seems about the same as before as is quantity, but price has increase by a couple of dollars, making it no longer a quick, cheap meal."}
{"text":"I'm not from Illinois but I came to take a look around the campus with a friend. Being fans of everything Korean, we decided to stop by at the Spoon House. I tried their spicy seafood platter and loved it. It was well worth the price.

I also got the Korean quesadilla/taco. Those tasted not so great and oddly sweet."}
{"text":"Never have had a bad experience here. Food is always on point. Love their bulgogi burritos!! I would've given 5 stars, but its on the pricy side."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years because of distance issues but I still dream of their food every day!"}
{"text":"My three friends, my boyfriend and I ate at Spoon House on Friday at about noon (3/19). The food was mediocre, the ambiance was good, and I left feeling pretty satisfied. The satisfaction wore off, and the nightmare began, like so many B-grade horror movies. 
Fast forward to Saturday night. My stomach feels like it's being stabbed by a thousand treacherous knives, and my boyfriend is not doing much better. We're getting chills, we're achy, and we can't do much beyond lay on our backs and bemoan our pathetic existence.
Around 10:30, calamity hit. Our apartment bathroom devolved into a Lord of the Flies scenario, with both of us fighting past each other to find something, anything, to throw up into. Vomit the consistency of wet granola spewed out of each of us like buckshot. I will spare you the details of our other bodily functions, but let's just say that by dawn, our bathroom resembled a Pollock. 
My boyfriend only vomited once. One of the unfortunate souls we dined with threw up over twelve times All of us were too weak to do much beyond lay on our respective bathroom floors, undergo unspeakably painful stomach cramps, vomit, and pray for an Easter miracle. 
Spoon House, all of Neptune's great ocean will not wash this blood from your hands. We're graduate students. We all have deadlines and conferences coming up, and having to sleep in a bathtub because I just can't stop throwing up is not the best use of my time. The fact that all five of us had different dishes just underscores the fact that you guys need to start following health code before you get shut down. As per my scorched earth policy, I will never go back and I will warn all of my friends about your culinary betrayals. Get it together."}
{"text":"Worst dinning service ever! The Korean guy who ordered showed no respect to the customers. The order took half an hour when I arrived there around 2pm and there was no other order. Worse things kept happening. When I got the order, I asked for small bag for my milk tea, and the Korean guy rudely said there wasn't one and use his finger to put in my milk tea accidentally when he tried to open the lip and refuse the exchange!!!!! I also asked for extra noodle and I didn't see much noodle!!!!!! Rudest Korean guy I ever met!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the soondubu jjigae on a rainy afternoon just awhile ago. Saltiest broth I've EVER had at a Korean restaurant. I couldn't even drink the soup. All the seafood in my bowl was incredibly rubbery and difficult to swallow. The added sodium did not help. On top of all this, the soup had no weight and was really thin. I was basically drinking salt water.

Hoping for a better experience next time."}
{"text":"Manager accused us of stealing spoons which was weird, but other than that they have good sweet and spicy chicken."}
{"text":"I love their food. My favorite are their burritos because they make the tortilla crispy. The flavors are Korean flavors so it is not your typical burrito. It is quite a unique food experience."}
{"text":"Has a good range of standard Korean dishes (bulgogi, ddubboki, kimbap, kimchi jigae, etc.) as well as burritos, tacos, and quesadillas. 

Ordered the spicy pork bulgogi. Service was quick but the meat tasted overcooked and dry. 

We came within the last hour of closing so the service was all over the place. The rest of my party had to wait 15-20 minutes for their food to be ready and they messed up one of my friend's order twice. They also seemed to try to usher everyone out by putting the rest of the orders after mine in to-go boxes. 

On the plus side, they sell bubble tea from Cocomero but they also ran out of boba while we were there."}
{"text":"The food here is very good! Big bowl of seafood soup! The cashier lady had a very horrible attitude! Didn't smile didn't even want to answer our questions! She basically ruined the experience! To the Asian cashier lady....you need to cheer up or quit your job."}
{"text":"This place has its ups and downs but it doesn't really stand out at all. I've been here a few times already, two times with some friends in my department and another to take my friend out for a birthday dinner. Both times, I got tacos (specifically spicy chicken and sweet and sour.) I've also tried bits of their other flavors of taco as well as their udon noodle soup. The food is sometimes a bit salty, but it may have just been that isolated visit that had that problem.
Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty solid, the tacos are on point, and their tea is good. I like how they let you service your own water in an easy and sanitary way (there's a dispenser along one of the walls next to the cutlery and napkins.)

The decor is really homey and cute, almost like cafes in Korea. The walls are bright and the decorations are great. The restaurant is roomy and you won't have a problem finding a place to sit. 

Now that I've listed some of the positive, let me tell you about my biggest reservation about this place. It is so, so, so slow, There could be only 4 people waiting for food and it'd still take upwards of 15 minutes to get out 3 tacos. For this reason, I there aren't ever a ton of people waiting which lessens the problem but still, it shouldn't take so long to get food. Additionally, I've heard from many friends that the staff can be unfriendly at times. I'm not sure who they are talking about because I've never felt like the staff were particularly rude or impolite.

All in all, if you're not in a hurry, grab a comfy seat and take in the atmosphere. The food is good if you're willing to wait. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Not coming back again. Beware of bad service and costly items."}
{"text":"I really like the place: clean and brightThe seafood jeon they have is so good for breakfast. You can buy a serving (4 to 5 pieces) for $2.95"}
{"text":"I had the tofu burrito.  It was ok, not too greasy, maybe a little cheese heavy.  Very nice crispy tortilla though, not a soft doughy mess like you get at say, Chipotle.  Actual effort went into presentation, which was a bit of a surprise, and the service was pleasant enough.  Flavor wise, the ingredients were fresh and well prepared, but the burrito itself was sweet to a fault.  

The atmosphere is pretty surreal though.  A strange mix of Motown, Coldplay, and some indie rock are piped through the speakers.  Phrases like \"Dream, until your dreams come true\" are painted on the walls.  Large, shiny spoons are hung from the walls.  

For Korean, you're probably better off at A-ri-rang.  That being said I've definitely had worse, and the place itself is kind of a trip."}
{"text":"Spoon House is a great place for lunch. I love the Mex-Asian fusion bugolgi burritos as well as the the traditional options on the menu. The food isn't the best Korean food I've eaten, but it sure hits the spot when I'm craving some bi bim bop. 

If you have never tried Korean food, Spoon House it's a great place to start. The menu is full of popular Korean dishes, and if you're not feeling adventurous, the burritos and tacos are a great alternative."}
{"text":"I went there with two of my friends today for dinner. I wanted to order some type of meat dish, but one of my friend stopped me saying its meat dishes are not that good. She heard that Jja Zang Mian (some Chinese style black noddle) is one of its better dish, so we went for that. Anyway, it tasted pretty bad,,, to the point that makes me wonder why I am giving two stars. I guess I want to give them benefit of doubt that some of other dishes might be better... But,,, jjazangmian is supposed to be its one of its better dishes, so what should I expect from other dishes?"}
{"text":"I walked by their poster advertising Taco Tuesday and Thursday, and being curious about Asian fusion food, I decided to buy some...on a Wednesday. I was kind of hoping the regular price was worth it, but I was disappointed. By no means did they taste bad, but they weren't great either. I was kind of irked by the sogginess. It was all mushy and the juices from the meat mixing with the sauce made eating the \"taco\" like eating a moist sponge. I got a bulgogi beef and bulgogi chicken taco, and I noticed this was the same issue for both tacos. The beef was okay, but didn't have much flavor besides being spicy. The chicken was a bit dry, but despite that, it tasted pretty good with a mix of sweet and spicy. I'm not a pro on Korean food, but I think K-Bowl and Arirang do it better along with better pricing/portions."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, got disappointed every time. One time I ordered a noodle No.34, and I got diarrhea immediately after. Another time, I came with my friends. After all of them started their dishes, I waited several minutes and asked the front desk whether my dish was ready? The cashier said:\" if you wanna complain, save it and have a seat.\" I think he was really impolite. This place cooks dishes like shit, and cashier speaks like shithead!"}
{"text":"Get there Korean tacos. The sweet and Spicy chicken tacos are fantastic. I usually get a couple different flavors. Get 2 if you aren't that hungry. 3 if you are.

I've gone back several times and even taken some friends. They all enjoyed it quite a bit. Definitely give this place a try if your looking for something fun and new."}
{"text":"no. no. no. no. I don't review often, and really, I'm only writing this now as a reminder to never go to this place, ever again. My table ordered the kimchi quesadilla, chicken quesadilla, fried tofu tacos, and the Gangnam style fries, because it all seemed so novel (naively). What a mistake.

The quesadillas were soggy with orange grease. The cheese on all the dishes was stiff and re-solidifying within five minutes. Their kimchi tasted like canned cabbage with no flavor, but perhaps it's because they \"caramelize\" (flash fried in grease?) it. My stomach was NOT happy the next day.

I think the price was worth it, considering I purchased both a dish and the resolution to never eat here ever again. The fried tofu tacos was the only dish that looked somewhat fresh. Perhaps the straight Korean dishes are better (it's what most of the other patrons were ordering), but I'm not willing to find out. For now, I'll stick with A-Ri-Rang."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place, I had it once probably 5-6 years ago and remembered it being decent. Well it has gotten better, it was UNBELIEVABLE! I tried the chicken bulgogi burrito, sweet and spicy chicken plate and pork dumplings. 

The burrito was off the freaking chain! Super cool fusion between Mexican and Korean food. I got cilantro on it and squeezed the lime on top as well, perfect combination of flavors.

Sweet and spicy chicken plate was amazing, it was served with a big bowl of rice. The chicken came sizzling hot on a fajita plate with nice large slices of onions. Real, huge chunks of white chicken breast meat. 

I cannot wait to go back, I want to try the ramen as well as the steak bulgogi burrito and the tacos. They also have free Kimchi in the fridge, it was unlike any kimchi ive had before. It was nice chunk sizes and nice and sweet while very slightly spicy. 

Go check it out!!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here since my freshman year, and I'll get to why at the end, but l'll start off with what else I can remember. As with most Korean places on campus, the food is good, the place is clean, and the prices are a little higher than I'd like to pay. They have standard Korean fare like Bulgogi and Bibimbap, as well as twists like bulgogi burritos and tacos. These are all quite good, and the burrito is definitely something worth trying, if not just for the novelty of it. You can also get bubble tea here, which is the same as the bubble tea from Cocomero.

Now, the reason why I haven't been here in about 3 years, despite liking the food, is because I found a hair in my taco. I did get a refund, but things like this shouldn't happen."}
{"text":"don't know if it's authentic in Koreans' opinion. I was there ordered rice cake w/ fish cake and tastes good. The ambiance was good too, great lighting and space. will go there again if I have that crave for Korean food"}
{"text":"I'm so surprised that Spoon House has such mediocre ratings on Yelp! Then again, you learn after a while to take reviews (even those with a 100+ comments) with a grain of salt. Last week I went to a 4.5-star rated Korean restaurant rated by 220 people and left pretty disappointed, while my mom+sister vowed to never trust my recommendations again.

I should note that I don't go to UIUC, so I can't compare this with other restaurants in the area, but for what it is, Spoon House is pretty darn decent. They have innovative menu items (Korean tacos, anyone? or galbi-filled onigiri?), nice decor, decent food...what else do you want from a casual spot? It's not trying to be a a candle-lit date-night gourmet spot, so I won't hold it to such standards.

I had the spicy tofu pan noodles, my mom got the bibimbop with stone bowl (not worth the extra $2 but otherwise good), and my sister the milk tea and two tacos. My pan noodles were surprisingly made from pad thai noodles and tasted fine, but I just wouldn't have expected to find pad thai noodles from a Korean restaurant. My mom's bibimbop was again, pretty good, except they were a bit skimpy on the beef. My sister's milk tea was from powder for $4, but that's what floats her boat & the tapioca perfectly done. 

There's no table-side service. All in all, I'd definitely consider stopping by again when I'm in town :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is decent, the food was ok, but you can't offer extra noodles in a fish that I will pay for? You shouldn't be in the restaurant business"}
{"text":"I had the spicy nakji bokeum and it was surprisingly good. The restaurant is clean and not too loud or crowded."}
{"text":"It's kind of a hit-or-miss experience eating here for me. Sometimes the food is great and sometimes it's just okay. It's never been bad though, so I'll keep coming back for now. The menu has a mix of your standard Korean fare  and Korean-Mexican fusion and it's a pretty large menu. 

The first time I ate here I think I got a bulgolgi quesadilla and I remember it just dripped grease. That was a few years ago and my last couple of visits have been much better, luckily. Last time I went I ordered the bulgogi burrito -- the meat was good but the rest of the burrito was a little plain and seemed like it was almost missing something. However, I'd probably still order this again and maybe just throw some kind of sauce on it at home? I also got the ddukbokki which was really good; not too sweet, not too spicy, and the rice cakes didn't even get tough and chewy when they were cold. 10/10 would buy again.

The service is fairly quick. You order at the counter and when your food is ready your number shows up on a little monitor in the dining area and you go and grab it. Usually I've ordered to go, but the space is fairly large and clean if you wanted to eat there. I'm not too familiar with a ton of restaurants around campus, but the prices here seem okay/average. If you're looking for a quick spot to get dinner, I'd recommend. It'll fulfill your craving for Korean food for cheap, but don't expect it to be the best you've had in your life."}
{"text":"The place is actually one of the nicest place on campus but the food is very salty! I tried to tell the kitchen not to put a lot of salt but they still put a lot. If you're looking for salty food then I would recommend this place. If not, forget it."}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE!!!
Recently I've been to Spoon House a couple of times, however, I'm very very disappointed today because the person they hire is very very rude. She literally exhibits impatience and left without me finishing my sentence. She just walked away!
They can do a much better job by hiring someone with a little bit more courtesy and patience."}
{"text":"My favorite  on campus, and the spicy pork tacos and bibimbap are excellent.

Note: You'll wait awhile for your food."}
{"text":"One of the best fast Korean in town. This restaurant is a little busy during lunch hours but the food quality is worth it. They do anything from KimBop to Kimchi Chigae. They even do Korean style tacos and types of Ramon.

Kimbop was a little sub part (maybe just the day) but the food was great and my friends who have no Korean food experience loved it. 

The free water machine and tea reminds me of Korea!!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review by dropping from 4 stars to 2 stars after my second meal at Spoonhouse. This time I had the Bi Bim Bap in hot stone bowl.  I am forced to compare it to the same dish served at Ai-Ri-Rang or B-Won, both of which are much better.  

At Spoonhouse the proportion of white rice was much higher, with less meat and veggies.  The stone bowl was not as hot and therefore the rice didn't scorch the way it should, and the final insult was that the Srirachi sauce was served in squirters labeled: \"Bi Bim Bap sauce--hot\".  It would be as if McDonald's labeled their ketchup: \"hamburger sauce\", assuming the customers had no idea what the food was like or how to use the sauce.
Lastly, the reference to burritos, tacos and quesadillas is offensive.  It's Korean food.  It doesn't need Mexican names to be understood."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty cheap compared to other korean places I've been. We came specifically for their $1 tacos which happens every Tuesday and Thursday from 2PM-4PM (in the Fall and Winter, not sure about summers). BF and I came and ordered three tacos for a mid-afternoon small snack before dinner. My favorites were the spicy pork and the beef bulgogi. Even though I didn't eat anything either than their tacos, I got a good look at their menu and at what everyone else was eating. Their noodle dishes and stone pot dishes were HUGE. For about average price, you get a ton of quantity (can't say anything about the taste because I didn't try them!). 
The tacos themselves tasted exactly like korean bbq with fresh lettuce covering a generous serving of each type of meat, freshly grilled and marinated to perfection. My only complaint was that the wrapping they used for the taco was clearly store bought, cold, and extremely chewy (the taco overall was warm, the meat being hot but the taco wrapper being room temp). If they would only grill their tortillas/buy some better quality ones/make their own and then fill it with the meats, it would be perfect.

Will be coming again to try other things on their menu for a real meal!"}
{"text":"Nice decor and design.
Love it, actually.
Not a fan of the food. Too much rice in the burrito. not made so that each bite has a bit of everything, as i'd like.
i had the pork beef burrito. it was alright. if you like cilantro, you'll enjoy it a little more.
complimentary water cups!

1 star for decor/design
1 star for all you can eat kimchee."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their sizzling cast iron skillet dishes - especially the beef bulgogi and spicy pork. They really are served sizzling hot and fresh and with deliciously seasoned veggies. I also recommend the beef bibimbap. You can also help yourself to free kimchi while you're waiting for your food.

I will be coming back to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"I was hoping to be the first to review but oh well :)

Spoon House Korean Kitchen just opened on Green Street this week. I was pretty excited to go sometime this week. From the name of the place, Spoon House, I was hoping to sit in front of a hot bowl of traditional Korean soup on a nice cold night but the name was a little deceiving. The place was very bright and well-lit. The menu was lit on flat screen TVs which was a pretty cool feature in the restaurant. 

The menu consist of Korean-style tacos/burritos, Spoon House trays (Korean-style meat entree), and rice and noodle dishes, however, the menu was limited and a little random? One of the random dish was a ramen and kimbap combo (korean-style sushi)  which seems like a genius idea since this place is located on a college campus. I mean, what college kid wouldn't like that? 

My boyfriend and I (yes, I mention him every time I yelp... we like to eat a lot) shared a 3 taco combo special which include a fountain drink for $6.95 and Bulgogi tray. We also got an extra taco (each taco cost $2.00) to divide the food equally. 

The wait for the food was a little long since it wasn't busy which I can see as an issue during busy hours, but I didn't mind the wait. More importantly, let me talk about my meal....

The tacos were nothing special. If you get the 3 taco combo special, it's nice that you can mix your pick of types of taco meat (bulgogi beef, bulgogi chicken, sweet and spicy chicken, or spicy pork). In my opinion I thought the tacos were eh okay. On a good note, the tacos felt light. I didn't feel like I want to roll home like I do when I eat Chipotle's burrito. 

The Bulgogi tray was pretty disappointing... maybe because of my Korean background, and growing up with awesome Korean mom/cook, I judge Korean meals critically. The bulgogi tray came with rice, side salad, 2 puny potstickers, an eggroll, and sweet potato fries. Suggestion... if you claim you're a Korean restaurant, why wouldn't you add kimchi in the tray? Kimchi is ubiquitous dish for Koreans. It's kinda of an insult to not have Kimchi at a Korean restaurant. 

Overall, the experience (food, service, atmosphere) wasn't terrible but  it was mediocre. It seems like Spoon House has catered their menu towards Western's taste. The food seems healthy and fresh, which you don't really get from other restaurants on Green Street. I wouldn't mind going to there again, but I might have to try something else on the menu. I wish their business good luck."}
{"text":"If you want pure Korean food, this place has it, but you are better off going to any of the regular Korean restaurants in town.  

I'm still giving it a few stars because it is somewhat of a novel concept, which I support.  I'd hate to lose the only Korean burrito place we have.  I'll probably be back occasionally, but it's not going to be a regular stop."}
{"text":"By God it has come to this, Dollar store ramen pretending to be a restuarnt, my food tasted like cigars and dirty coins because the chefs do not wear gloves and the inhumanity of the cashier begs to differ the idea of fair trade. Be someones bitch and eat shit i think not"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Korean food so I've tried every Korean restaurant on/near campus. Spoon House is neither the best nor worst on the list. It's pretty reasonably priced compared to all the other restaurants. You can also get a wide selection of the Korean basics. Additionally, they offer Korean-Mexican fusion items such as tacos, burritos, and quesdillas. I've only had the tacos during happy hour when they're $1. Nothing spectacular but definitely worth it for a dollar! I've also had the Jjam Bbong before, and it was not bad! It was a teeny, tiny bit bland but other than that, pretty good!"}
{"text":"I like that this place does Korean-Mexican fushion food with their burritos and tacos, but sometimes their food is either a hit or a miss.

It's a very nice go-to when I want quick korean food. 

Their miso soup was good for when I'm cold and need a quick Asian soup pick-me-up."}
{"text":"Ok, it's time I finally fessed up.  I don't really like most Asian food.  There, I said it.  Let loose the rotten tomatoes.

I really wanted to give two stars, but taking my dislike into account, I'm giving 3.  I got the sweet and spicy chicken tray, which came with rice, roasted potatoes, and a salad.  It was entirely too much food, but that's a different story.

The chicken itself was cooked well, but the sauce was just kind of blah, and not spicy enough.  The salad was fresh and the dressing was pretty good.  The potatoes, believe it or not, were the star of the tray.  They were cooked to perfection, and seasoned perfectly with salt and (I think) parmesan.  Really sort of an odd side, but it worked.  It all came on a neat tray, dividing all the foods from one another.  I love that.  I know I'm a weirdo.

It was all a bit expensive, too.  The tray--though I previously mentioned was way too much food for me--was $13 not including a drink, which was more than it was worth, in my opinion.

I'm also torn on the ordering system.  They give you a number and have you sit, then your number pops up on a screen above the counter when it's ready.  Quite efficient and convenient, but the bell got annoying after going off so many times and it kind of reminded me of the DMV."}
{"text":"Their ramen was made from the instant noodle packets that can be purchases at your local grocery market! 
I had a chicken dish which came with rice, noodles, and a salad, but their chicken was overcooked an extremely dry. 
Stay away!"}
{"text":"Spoon House, well done!! The beef bibimbap that I had today was bomb!!! The portion was huge. The veggies, beef and rice just balanced so well! Plus, the perfect fried egg with runny yolk was definitely a bonus! Can't wait to go there next time and try a different one. BTW, they all look and smell so good!"}
{"text":"I don't know, I actually enjoy Spoon House. They are nice, have a decent selection, the food tastes good and the prices and portions are decent. I particularly enjoy the milk tea, same as Cocomero's, rice triangles and the veggie bibimbap burritos they sell here. The side kimchi they have here is really hit or miss thought, mostly miss."}
{"text":"Pros:
+Easy walk from campus
+Lots of variety on the menu
+Pretty good prices (large burrito and a bottle of water cost me about $10).
+Chicken bulgogi burrito was very good.I really enjoyed it!

Cons:
-The system was a little weird to get used to for a first-time visitor. Your order number displays on a screen when it's ready. Some warning or explanation might have helped."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on 3/29/2013 with 4 of my friends. Turns out that all 5 of us have food poisoning now, so I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone (especially considering how mediocre the food is)."}
{"text":"I had the sweet and spicy chicken, and loved it! This place is somewhat expensive, but you get a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and really enjoyed my meal. I forgot the exact name of what I ordered, but it was the $6.95 beef bulgogi bowl. It was a simple bowl of rice, bulgogi, and some sort of pickled vegetable, and it was delicious! Good price and nice portion size as well. I would definitely come back to eat this bowl again."}
{"text":"As a korean restaurant, i can say that most of the food can be bettered by a korean place down the street. But the korean taco's at spoon house are a great example of fusion food done right, probably one of my favorite things i've had"}
{"text":"If you feel like spooning with your friends, you should try doing so here... Or not. 

Anyway, they got a good mix of Korean items. I tried out the bulgogi and it was painfully average when you have to pay $12 for a meal."}
{"text":"I tried their beef burrito and it deserves 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Probably the most unsatisfying Korean meal I ever had. Save yourself the trouble and goto A-Ri-Rang"}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place since I work on campus and love a good taco. They have $1 tacos on Tuesday and Thursdays, but since we went on Wednesday there was no deal in sight. We were told that the $1 are smaller as well. I still wanted a taco so I tried a sweet and spicy chicken taco and the beef taco. My friend warned me that their special taco sauce can be overpowering so I'm glad they only gave me a little. The tacos were fairly large so I didn't mind the $6 price tag. The spicy chicken was just right and flavorful. I added a little soy to balance the heat. However, the tortilla was really dry and thick. You should never taste the tortilla before you taste the filling. The other taco, the beef, was okay. The meat was a little dry and it was a little bland even with their taco sauce. Unfortunately my soy sauce could not improve it either. I was happy to see they have the flavored Aloe Vera drinks (Pomegranate!) so that topped off a pretty decent meal.

Oh, as for ambiance, the place is bright, clean, and has plenty of seating. You are expected to go get your food and there is a ticketing system so don't throw away your receipt until you know your order number.

TLDR: Get sweet/spicy chicken taco with soy sauce or stick to the Korean menu"}
{"text":"Awesome beef bulgogi rice, haven't tried other Korean places in the area so cant compare. Portion was sufficient though the bulgogi was so nice I wanted more after finishing."}
{"text":"This place started out with potential but seems to have declined rapidly. First they had decent size portions at an affordable rate with free miso soup. Now they have reduced size portions, no free miso, and increased prices--do they think people don't notice? 10$ for sub par bibimbab isn't going to cut it on campus, especially not with Sushi Avenue around. 

They do have some interesting looking items on the menu though, and I will say the customer service is less surly than your typical Korean restaurant (a-ri-rang, b won)."}
{"text":"This is the most underrated place on campus. Great food. Love their stone bowls and jijigae. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Spoonhouse is aight.  It's relatively cheaper than other korean places around campus, but you also don't get banchan besides radish kimchi you pick up yourself.  It's a good place for lunch with friends since it's a more casual atmosphere.  The portions are pretty big depending on what you get.  I've had the bibim naengmyun, yook gae jang, kimchi jjigae, and jjampong here. Out of those four dishes, I would say the bibimyun and yook gae jang are the best.  The yook gae jang has a lot of beef and isn't too spicy.  The bibim naengmyun is great for hot days as a cold sweet and spicy dish. The jjampong had a lot of noodles and soup, but you can tell a majority of the seafood came from frozen since they're small and a little chewy."}
{"text":"I love a good bowl of ramen but still I'm yet to find a restaurant serving good ramen in Champaign. I saw this place on green street and thought of trying it out. It had mixed review on Yelp but still took my chance. My husband and I ordered ramen and japchae. I asked them what kind of broth do they use in ramen and the person behind counter told me they use powder(???). Then only I knew how my food is gonna taste. Ramen was under seasoned, no flavor but dumplings tasted good. For some reason it tasted off for me. Japchae tasted less than ok, I couldn't eat more than few bites. Staff is friendly but food is below average. It's not for me."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian ramen I've had also Taco Tuesday is a plus."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
Slowly this has become my go to Korean restaurant based on the cleanliness, portions, and taste of the food. They have a menu that is the Korean Mexican fusion. I have tried the korean burrito with beef bulgogi. It is more sweet than savory compared to a traditional mexican burrito. Unfortunately I think I still prefer the latter. I believe that there highlight is in the traditional Korean dishes. The Budae Jigae has a mixture of everything from spam, pepperoni, ham, and noodles. Another highlight would be the stone bowl bi-bim-bap that comes out piping hot. Overall, they have solid korean food at great prices and it is located right at the start of green street.

Pros: good prices, large korean food selection, fast service

Cons: a touch of MSG is likely in some of the food as you get that thirst after eating here. Maybe difficult to find parking.

Hidden deals:
1 dollar taco Tuesday and Thursday from 2-5 pm
Self busing of trays so no need to tip
