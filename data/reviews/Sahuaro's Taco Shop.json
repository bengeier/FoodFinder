{"text":"Awesome taco shop! Great food, very clean, and really friendly staff. Lengua, pastor, asada, and tripas tacos very delicious!! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Carne asada and pork carnitas we're delicious!  They were fast, polite and did I say my tacos we're  delicious? What a great find!"}
{"text":"Great Customer Service, The Carne Asada Burrito was Excellent will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great new taco shop with a veteran owner.  Felix has been in the business for a long time and I am excited that he has opened this place so close to us.  I ordered 3 tacos; pastor, carnitas, and carne asada.  All 3 were fantastic with fresh corn tortillas and onions and cilantro!  While waiting for my tacos I was served warm chips and amazing salsa.  If you love delicious Mexican food you must eat here!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and the salsa has a nice kick to it! Great place to eat. They even have Mexican coke."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Loved the Menudo!!! Met with the owner Edgar and he was super friendly and made sure our experience was great. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some authentic mexican food. Next time I am trying there ceviche tostada. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Yelp churned this up in my quest for taco goodness. As a voracious taco enthusiast a new local shop within a short drive is a MUST TRY. These folks did not disappoint. Although I struggled to find the right door for entry into this taco heaven I was immediately greeted by the sultry smell of grilled meats and tortillas. The salsa bar was immaculate and well stocked with flavorful sauce and pickled onions (a personal fav.) The menu is fantasticly deep- having cabeza, lengua and barbacoa on the menu really got my attention.  I ordered a mixed plate of 6 different meats, just to try as many as my stomach would hold and was amazed at how awesome these little flavor vessels packed. Go eat there, dont ask questions just do it. You wont regret this."}
{"text":"Was driving by and decided to stop in for a few tacos. Glad I did!! They were amazing, so good that I got a few more to take home with me!! And it's not just the regular tacos, they have the good stuff tripas and lengua.  Great prices and a friendly staff. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Got a Chorizo and Egg Burrito and a Red Chile Burrito with Nopales.  Both were excellent!  The burritos are good sized and had great flavor.  A great place to get some quick, homemade Mexican food."}
{"text":"Staff was polite, the location was clean, food was phenomenal. My husband's compliant is \"it wss too hot and the enchilada sauce had to much cinnamon\". I deffanitly liked it better than my hubby did."}
{"text":"I've been to many Mexican restaurants but this one definitely deserves the cake! This taco shop not only has fair and low prices but everything is cooked from scratch and feels homemade! The service was great very polite and had a great attitude. I'm a huge fan when it comes to breakfast burritos and their bacon egg potato breakfast burrito is far better than elmers, los favoritos, espos, and even mi casita! Everything tastes fresh and I was able to get my meal in 5 minutes and less normally it takes about 10 minutes to get my food from other places which isn't bad at all but if you want quick fresh food this is the place to be! Keep up the hard work I'll be back for sure next time"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great pricing! Got yourselves a new regular! I've been to many taco shops around the valley, and this one, BY A MILE, takes it to a whole new level of freshness, speed, and quality. Simple food, from scratch? Count me in!"}
{"text":"Great little taco shop in the car wash. Very clean. They have a great salsa bar. I had three tacos all were delicious. I definitely recommend them. Can't wait to come back and try a burrito."}
{"text":"I came in at 7pm and the lady at the front desk was so rude. I walked up to the counter and nobody was there. I waited 2 minutes and this young girl comes from the back chomping on food. The only reason why she came to the front was because the phone was ringing. She didn't even acknowledge me and just answered the phone.  When she answered she giggled and was laughing and said why are you calling me I'm at work right now. Then she proceeded to say \" oh you want to order some food what do you want?\" She took their order which took 3 minutes and asked if they wanted red or green sauce.   Then she finally got off the phone and looked at me all rude and said \"what do you want?\" And I said can I get a burrito with green sauce and said she was out of green sauce. I then asked her what would she recommend to go along with the red sauce since she said there was no more green sauce but the person on the phone ordered green sauce. She just stared at me and said idk. Meanwhile these other customers asked her if she had any lids for the salsa and so looked over and replied no.   She looked back at me and said well what can I get you instead and I just looked at her and said \"I'm good actually you have been so rude ever since I walked in the door I didn't feel welcomed.\" I walked out and I was so appalled by her guest service she was one of the worst employees I have ever encountered.   I loved this place and the other girl who works the front desk is always smiling and happy. But because of this one employee I will not be retiring which is sad because I loved this place."}
{"text":"I'm excited about this new place! We just had the carne asada combo and the carnitas combo. Great flavor! And the rice was the best I've had in a long time. They also have a very nice salsa bar.  The staff is nice and answered any questions we had.  We will definitely be back.  (BONUS: It's so close to my house!!)"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Az, everything made fresh, great service and all for a good price. Family owned and family recipes, will go back again and again!!! Love it."}
{"text":"two words: potato tacos. otherwise, this place would just get three stars. i'm reserving the right to change my rating later though. i also got the veggie burrito, and i wonder why there isn't a mexican restaurant that can get it right. it's always so much meh. this place is right down the street from where i work, so i'm sure i'll be trying some other menu items soon and updating my review. i also seem to have picked the wrong salsa, as the one i got - with visible seeds even - didn't have any heat."}
{"text":"This place is right next to a car wash but don't let that deter you from trying this restaurant. I ordered the carne asada tacos with beans and rice for myself and and shrimp tacos for my boyfriend to go. The woman taking my order was very friendly and welcoming. While waiting on my food, I went to salsa bar to get salsa, lime and cabbage. Everything was fresh. The tacos was delicious and full of flavor! I loved the rice too! I will be coming back to try other items off the menu soon! Delicious and authentic!"}
{"text":"For a car wash taco shop its not to bad. My husband and I love Mexican food. We eat it at least every other day. My husband had the carne asada tacos with rice and beans. The carne asada was a bit over cooked so it was dry. The rice tasted like rice a roni. The beans had a nice flavor. I tried a shredded beef hard taco, beef enchilada with red sauce and a bean a cheese burrito. The shredded beef taco meat was very tasty. The enchilada was my favorite. The bean and cheese burrito was a good size. It tasted good also. The salsa bar was great. Due to the restaurant being part of a car wash the seating area is quite small. We went on a Saturday night and there was a wait because they only had one cook and one counter person. They were friendly and apologized for the wait. It wasn't to expensive either."}
{"text":"The prices are EXTREMELY good, the taco selection is good and the speed was really prompt. I was really happy to have tried something new (and more importantly local)."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We had breakfast - burritos and menudo - it was yummy. The guacamole was tasty and we could tell that it was just freshly made. Service was prompt and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Absolute fire! Carne Asada with no beans is my go to! Simple burrito with great taste. The salsa is amazing as well! Their salsa bar has pickled onions, cucumbers, limes, carrots, extra cilantro, etc. Cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"The food in this little taco shop is super good! There are also right next to a car wash so while you're having your car detailed you can sit here and eat. What separates them from other taco shops is that they're cooking and the quality of me is superb. The food is very tasty and not bland. They also have a fresh bar where you can get fresh salsa cucumbers limes cilantro and onions. We got a breakfast burrito with bacon potato and egg, and I can't answer a burrito and then I went to the Fixin's bar and added some shredded cabbage and salsa. It was delicious I will be back."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but there is much better Mexican fast food around. A bit pricey for the portion size as well."}
{"text":"Awesome little taco shop inside car wash. Must try spot. Great service. Great food. Excellent prices. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, I've had the chorizo burrito on numerous occasions and just now had a tripa torta, and it was amazingly good, I highly recommend. Excellent customer service and always on point."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best Carnitas and Chicken tacos I've had since I moved to AZ in '93!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food,  really sweet and helpful staff and you can get your car washed while you wait. What more could you want??  Seriously tho,  have eaten in once and picked up carry out a few times. Haven't been disappointed in a single thing I tried."}
{"text":"The service was friendly, the food was excellent and the prices very fair. My husband loved his carne asada and shredded beef. I had a carnitas burrito that was moist and flavorful.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. The tripas, cabeza, lengua were cooked perfectly. Tons of flavor. I didn't need to put salt on them like a normal taqueria, haha! They put a good amount of meat on the tacos.  The tortillas were great, not to soft, not to stiff. Nice salsa bar. good heat and flavor on the salsas. They had cucumber, chopped cabbage, pickled red onions/jalapenos as well.  Service was good. They bring the tacos to your table. Nice people. Prices are super fair.  I would check this place out. It tastes damn good.  They open at 6am too!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly great place inside the car wash, I come here a lot for lunch you can tell it's authentic - ignore all the negative comments below and give it a go you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Just discovered this little gem!  Who would think a great taco shop would be inside a car wash?  The shop is clean and appealing with a salsa bar for extra goodness!  Ordered a large order over the phone 15 minutes before pick-up and it was ready and waiting for me just as ordered.  They were very generous with the take out sides of green salsa, pico de gallo and guacamole.  I ordered 3 different taco types:  Carne Asada, Sahuaro and the fish tacos.  All were fabulous! I also ordered the Carne Asada and Carnitas burritos.  These were great as well.  But, the most popular item I ordered were the Carne Asada fries.  I wish I had ordered 3 of them as they were gone before I could serve the dinner!   They also have fresh cinnamon flour tortilla crisps that the kids and adults will love.    It is not often you can find a true mexican food restaurant that is clean and appealing that has great prices.  Don't let the construction in the parking lot deter you as there is plenty of parking available.    We will definitely be coming back here when we are craving good mexican food!"}
{"text":"Sahuaro's Taco Shop is amazing! I haven't tried everything on the menu BUT the chicken tacos are perfect. I grew up eating authentic Mexican food straight from my Nana's kitchen. She's an amazing cook just like her mother so I have quite the plates to compare to other restaurants. The chicken tacos I eat from here remind me of hers! This place will always be a go to for hard shelled tacos. I have had the soft tacos before with carne asada and they are pretty good as well. If you want to be completely blown away definitely stick to the hard tacos! The salsas are okay here as well. You have to  try the carrots in the salsa bar they are DELICIOUS but spicy. I did attach a picture of the nachos I ordered today and they were okay too, I should have kept the beans on they would've been WAY better. VERY IMPORTANT: They are ONLY accepting CASH at this time!"}
{"text":"If you're just looking for some tasty tacos you can't go wrong with this place. They've got a nice little salsa bar too. It can get a little pricey if you're adding on beans and rice but everything I've had here has been delicious.   I am looking forward to trying the enchiladas next time I'm here. So far my favorite taco has been the shredded chicken followed closely by the carne asada. Now if this place ever did a taco Tuesday special or something you know I would be here every week."}
{"text":"Read reviews about this place and thought we would give it a try.  I saw they make a Red Chili Burrito and I had to try it. I haven't had one of those in years. It was delicious. My husband had the Steak Burrito with a side of rice and beans.  He loved it all. We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious! I love their burritos. This is the only place that my boyfriend likes to eat the chorizo burrito!"}
{"text":"Small taco shop with good flavor and a lot of spice! Very clean and friendly staff! I had a chance to try the carne asada, carnitas, and fish street tacos! All would try again. They had my favorite fried hard shell tacos too! My boyfriend enjoyed the green chile pork burrito! Also, it's attached to the car wash. So it's a great place to get a bite to eat while you wait. I'll be back again for more!"}
{"text":"Seriously, awesome taco shop! My family loved everything about it! They have amazing food, even my kids loved it. It's very clean, and decorated so cute! The staff is very friendly and attentive! This is our new go to taco shop!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to see that a taco shop had opened only a mile from our house. I was doubly excited to see it had such great reviews! So I called in an order and sent my husband to pick it up. I asked the girl on the phone to include some limes and pickled onions in the bag as my husband didn't know what he was looking for and I'm at home with a broken foot. She reluctantly agreed. When he got there, the bag did not contain the sides. He did manage to grab them, but then got home to find that we didn't receive half the food we paid for.  As for the food, the asada and carnitas were good, but the shredded chicken was like baby food.  So, if you're planning to go in, by all means go. Get the asada or the carnitas. Don't, however, attempt to call in an order, and unless you have a toddler, don't bother with the shredded chicken.  As for us, we'll stick with the taco shops on the north side of the 60. :("}
{"text":"Wow!!! Hidden gem! Carnitas are the bomb!! Authentic and fresh. Yum!!! Rice and beans are for real!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife noticed their sign last week and had a yen for a taco so we dropped by on a Wednesday about noon for lunch.  I made the mistake to not order a taco in a taco shop!   My wife ordered a beef taco and a combo taco, tostata and a cheese enchilada which had salad, rice and beans.   The very best beans and rice I have ever eaten.  I was truly impressed!  I had a pork green chili burrito which had tons of fat and gristle free cubes of pork, unfortunately the meat   was rather tough and the sauce too thin for my liking.  If the sauce had more body and the meat was tender it would be a winner. We ordered their lemonade which was fresh but too sweet for me.  The floors and tables were clean and the majority of clients were latino, a good sign for a Mexican restaurant.   The condiment bar was great with fresh crisp cucumbers, pickled onions, pico de gallo, 3 different salsa, and much much more! We will be back to try other menu items.,"}
{"text":"Delicious food at a great price! The shredded chicken and barbacoa tacos were amazing. Was a short wait when we came in on Saturday afternoon. Staff is kinda quiet but no big deal. The food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly great from top to bottom, especially for something attached to a car wash. The cashier was extremely friendly, cordial and conversational. She discussed many of her favorite menu items upon request, and accepted custom orders with pleasure. The power was out, which was causing issues with the ATM and credit machines, for which she was very apologetic, and offered several solutions even though the issue was not the restaurant's fault.   The beverage selection is surprisingly large! They have homemade sangria and margarita, as well as a large selection of Jumex, Jarritos, and other ethnic bottles, as well as a standard Coke products fountain (and of course glass bottle Coke).   Another great feature is the salsa and toppings bar which is free for you take take as much as you want. Not a huge selection of salsas, but it's a nice feature hat I've been seeing disappear over the years.   The prices are CHEAP! Not just given the high quality of food, but also in general. Most tacos are $1.75, and burritos are $4-$5   I ordered a varied selection of tacos, and they tasted as good as they looked, which was EXCELLENT.   The only possible downside I can see to this place is the very limited seating. Even so, I came at Noon on a Monday which I would imagine to be prime time, and I had no problem finding a seat."}
{"text":"Most authentic tacos I have had in a long time!   They have a great salsa bar with all the fixings and their salsas actually have a bite to them!   I will certainly return."}
{"text":"The best shredded beef enchiladas I've had.  I went there to try there Breakfast items. Saw the line of customers & changed my mind. Glad I did.The Nachos are next. Tonight.... You can get your car washed,. The Arizona Car Wash Company, Hair Cut &  eat some of the tastest Mexican Food in Maricopa County. I will return"}
{"text":"Usually good food and service. Today - it sucked! The kid taking orders didn't know the menu and when I ordered a large drink and said the unsweet tea was running clear. He said that it was out and walked away. There was no offer of a refund - I don't drink soda. No offer to see if there was more in the back. The taco salad was soggy and the lettuce was so wet that it was impossible to eat. I don't know if I will go back. I cannot put up with bad service even if the salsa is amazing."}
{"text":"This is my new fav taco shop! I highly recommend the ceviche, alpastor tacos and the fresh salsa! It's definitely a must try of authentic Mexican food! They have friendly staff, good pricing, and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Friday night and everything was great! The chicken tacos were cooked perfectly, the torta was delicious and not soggy, and the quesadilla was good. Highly recommend the salsa verde. Staff was friendly, restaurant was clean, and there was no shortage of Tapatio! :) Only complaint, if any, was that the horchata was a little watery, but it WAS close to closing on a Friday."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The beans are excellent!  They have a really good flavor.  We really loved the chorizo and the ham breakfast burritos.  The tacos are excellent too.  There is a lot of flavor in the meat.  The green chili pork burrito was also delicious!  They gave a great condiment bar with really good sauces and pico!   We will definitely be back!  YUM!"}
{"text":"We were at the car wash when a gentleman started telling us about the new taco shop that just opened, so my sister and decided we would try it out! It also helped that the man gave us a coupon for free drinks! I ordered carnitas tacos with only beans, no rice( not a rice fan) and my sister got green chili steak burrito( something she would normally get at a Mexican restaurant.)  My review on my food: I opened the Togo container and was shocked at the small amount of meat.. however I'm currently leaning back because these two tacos were the perfect amount. I still have extra mean to finish off the second space of beans. The taste of the carnitas was juicy and flavorful! The beans also had a good flavor.  Her review: I opened my container and the burrito was nicely wrapped. I unwrapped it and it was a normal size I tortilla was soft and warm which was the best part. It was very very good and cheesy! I would most definitely get this burrito again!    We would recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Everything is new, clean, and the aromas from the kitchen will keep me coming back. Friendly service with a short wait. Very inexpensive and filling. Oh and did I mention their food is delectable?!? Because it is... See for yourself and try it."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. (It's connected to a car wash). The food and service were both very good. You are able to get in and out on an hour lunch."}
{"text":"Saw a lot of traffic while passing multiple times so had to try-  Clean and quick service and friendly- got burritos and an enchilada- burritos were decent but lacked that extra kick or sauce which would be nice. Meat was well cooked- both carnitas and chicken- enchilada was ok, nothing special. Will go back for tacos, since it's a taco place and interested to see how the the breakfast burritos are."}
{"text":"So we come here to order. We order and they hand us our cups to fill up our drinks. The people were somewhat short with me when I asked if they had any cups for the salsa bar. She points at one line cup about the size of a medicine cup. The chips are mediocre store bought chips. He salsa is very good, the enchiladas were very good. My carne asada was decent but dry. If you're Mexican they brink your drinks to you. I'm not a discriminator and hate discrimination. It doesn't feel nice on our end either."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the same complex as the car wash. There are so many good reviews here so I have it a try. It's very clean and the staff is very courteous. The food was amazing. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing red and green sauce! Fish tacos are the best around! Friendly and awesome service. Very big Breakfast burritos and all the food is prepared fresh. Been here 6 times in 2 weeks. Must try."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Hands down best homemade stuff.the buettios are huge. The plate I had was fresh and warm  Big plus. When I was a kid 4 a long time we eat cactus and eggs. ( nopales. ) that is old school stuff.i didn't  C it at first. So I told the owner I'd I could try it.and in minutes he brought me some FREE! Made my day. Only bad thing is that it's part of a car wash. But once u get ur food.it all goes away. Will b back.  .luv it"}
{"text":"While getting my car washed decided to have lunch, beef enchilada combo was really good! Can't wait to try the tacos on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Worst place. Been there twice and each time they have something shady going on with cash only lines.   I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, my husband and I stopped by this place last weekend.  It was very clean and the girl at the counter was very nice.  I ordered carnitas, sahuaro and carne asada soft shell tacos.  My husband ordered the same but a combo plate.  A man brought out our orders and after a time, we asked for my husband's rice and beans and he told us he was sorry and would bring it out.  Another 10 minutes passed and I am done with my food and my husband did not have his rice and beans, we asked the girl and she said sorry and then after he was almost done with his tacos, finally got his rice and beans.  I also was disappointed to see that there was no pico de gallo and other condiments at the condiment bar were almost gone.  They were never replaced while we were there.  That being said, by themselves the tacos were pretty good - because of the poor service I don't know if we would be back - my favorite all time is mucha taco."}
{"text":"How can a car wash have the best damned tacos I've tasted north of the border? You'll have to find out for yourself by coming by to eat! The food is fresh, well-prepared and full of flavor! We had crispy tacos (actually fresh-fried, not pre-made shells) stuffed with shredded chicken and beef, plus a really good guacamole tostada. All were topped with shredded cheese and fresh lettuce & tomatoes. We stocked up at the salsa bar with pickled carrots, onions, peppers, pico de gallo, lime wedges, cabbage, cilantro, onions and three salsas. Wow - the food was amazing. It was so good that all the other customers needed to talk about how good it was. The Mexican father & son next to us said it was the best food they had tasted and reminded them of their home in Sonora Mexico."}
{"text":"Amazingly good food in a little shop attached to a car wash!  I have been looking for a local place to get truly good tacos (I am talking about lengua; cabeza; pastor).  To me one of the tests for good Mexican food (besides the rice and beans which were very good by the way) is how well they do the lengua.  It needs to be super tender and flavorful.  This place hits it! We tried the lengua, the cabeza and the \"sahauro special\" tacos.  They were all very good.  The Sahauro special filling is a beef that is marinated and cooked in a sauce (very good).  We also tried their combo plate of an enchilada, tostada and crispy taco (chicken).  All very tasty. We ordered a bean and cheese burrito and carne asada burrito to go and ate them later.  All very good.  By the way they cook their carne asada on a grill right out front.  I would have given five stars if they had a ground beef taco (picadillo).  I am still trying to find a taco shop that has good ground beef tacos. Oh, by the way, they also have really good homemade salsa!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since we were having our car washed. We had a Chicken Taco and the Carne Asada Nachos and they were very filling. Good flavor. Condiments bar was full of options. And I like the fact that the server checked to make sure that our food was to your satisfaction."}
{"text":"I have been to this taco shop 5 times now and I'm not even sure they have been open a month. Great tacos, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Craving some tacos and decided to get my car washed along with hitting up this well-known local spot. Car wash was getting ready to close but that didn't stop us from going inside grabbing some tacos. First thing that drew my attention was the salsa bar & drinks... they looked refreshing & good. When I say drinks, soft drinks, fresh lemonade, horchata, and bottled sodas.    Got a total of 4 tacos... 3 soft and 1 hard. The hard we kept simple with chicken and it came with lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. For the 3 soft, I went with carne asana, fish and the sahuaro taco which is as carne with tomatoes.   3 tacos had a nice flavor and the salsa bar consisted of nice items such as lemons & limes, cucumbers, onions cilantro, pico de gallo, salsa and a few other items.   we also got a side of chips & salsa for $2 more at the end. The saucer they had I believe is similar to the one at the salsa bar but it was good and had a little bit of spicy kick to it (but not real spicy).  Definitely see myself coming back here when I'm craving a taco as the prices are decent and the flavors were good. The staff is very nice and it felt more like an was having a family style dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater and this place was sooooo good!!!! I had the carne asada burrito, they were very helpful in explaining the ingredients with me having a lot of allergies it really meant a lot. I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. The lady at the counter was too busy having a conversation with somebody else, to take my order. I stood there, waiting, for five minutes before she acknowledged me. The tacos were ok, but nothing special.  I live less than half a mile away from this place, but after such a lousy first impression, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 different tacos: carne asada, pastor, and both types of chicken.  The carne asada must have been from the bottom of the pan.  Greasy, hard as a rock and flavorless.  The grilled chicken was greasy as was the shredded chicken.  The pastor was okay."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed.  The tacos looked great and the salsa bar looked good.  But the tacos fell flat on flavor.  They just didn't taste like anything special.  I found them to be extremely average street tacos."}
{"text":"Sahuaro's Taco shop has the best carnitas in the east valley! Consistently delicious and very friendly staff! Also get the green Salsa from their Salsa bar, it'll blow your mind!"}
{"text":"This place is located in the car wash parking lot. Simple menu. Good food. Everything I've had is really good. Always clean and friendly quick service."}
{"text":"First time here as I'm working here from out of town.  I saw the high review ratings and thought I would try it out.  I had the Huevo Rancheros and ordered an appetizer of the Carne Assad nachos to share.  The food was GREAT!!!! The only downside was our appetizer came out after our entrees and our food came out in waves.  It would be nice to have the appetizer first then the rest of the food put at the same time.  I still have it 5 stars for the freshness of the food and the customer service provided."}
{"text":"First time experience was great, service with a smile and the food was delicious!! Had carne asada tacos and pastor they were both yummy, my wife had chicken tacos which she loved as well. Look forward to making this a regular spot."}
{"text":"Happy grand opening to family Edgar and Felix. Great food. Tacos de papa are my favorite.  Very cute atmosphere. Many blessings for you and may your business be grand.  I'm sure to be here every week."}
{"text":"Nothing to awe about, tacos slightly blah. Today was my first visit, multitasking, car wash and a taco. At first appearance it was very clean, well decorated with a simple and nice lay out.   I'm a fan of classic street tacos. So it was nice to see a place that is offering these under $2 each. I ordered 1 asada taco and 1 carnita taco with onion and cilantro.   Maybe it's just me, but everything seems to shrinking these days. Yea, my Barbie sized tacos were nicely proportioned on the mini corn tortilla.   The asada was well cooked for those few peices found that weren't burnt or just too tiny to maintain anything that could actual hold a taste. My carnitas were hard and I just had this image that the meat was sitting under some heat lamp losing all flavor before it was served to me.   The onion and cilantro was fresh and cut fine.  Overall, I do want to try this place again. Not impressed with the soft tacos. Will try something else next time."}
{"text":"Great little taco place built inside of a car wash, whoda think it?  Decided to try it for a breakfast burrito in the morning and tried the bacon, egg and potato version.  It was delivered to the table a was fully stuffed with goodness.  The salsa bar was very good and I loved the verde salsa on my burrito.  Eager to come back to try the carne Assad's at some point.  Service at the front counter was super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Visited from Seattle and it was fabulous. We had nachos and fish, shrimp, and asada tacos. I had the nachos with asada as an appetizer and it was plenty of food. Only complaint was it came out about 10 minutes before my friends' tacos. Maybe because it's technically an appetizer? The restaurant is clean and service is friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. Good variety at the fresh salsa bar.   Recommendation: label the salsas. We weren't sure what we were getting."}
