{"text":"Really great dinner, service was excellent.  Portions were big!  all the flavors very fresh, and authentic.  Thank goodness somebody in this town can serve an actual hot sauce (this was on the side - the usual mild sauce was also delicious!)  We'll definitely go back here. Basically a similar price bracket to most of the restaurants in the neighborhood, but definitely a better value."}
{"text":"Wow first time at Los planes, the food is fresh and very tasty the beer is cheap and cold. You have to eat here."}
{"text":"Seriously. Nachos were awesome. Crispy homemade chips, gobs of guacamole, sour cream, and salsa - all home made!

Chicken tacos were fresh and so tasty. Sangria Blanca was refreshing and chuggable. Tres bien."}
{"text":"This is one of the best salvadoran restaurants in Montreal.  It is delicious and the horchata is just perfect, not too sweet.  Most places make much too sweet horchata so for me that is a good point to see how good a place is."}
{"text":"We were actually looking for a Mexican restaurant when we stumbled upon this gem. The service was amazing, our waiter took time to explain whatever we did not understand on the menu as we never had Salvadorian food before.
They have advantageous combos that include an entrée, 2 choice pupusas and a cocktail or whatever other drink you would like. We had a margarita and a daiquiri, which were wonderful.
We had the yucca fries and chicken tamal as entrées they were delicious.
The pupusas were amazing and it is nice that you can add as much or as little spice to the food as it comes on the side.
For dessert we each had churros and a café au lait. To die for. All this came to 52$ we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"J'ai vraiment éte agreablement surpris d'avoir autant apprécié ce restaurant. Je suis allé un peu a reculons car je connais los planes original un restaurant salvadorien bien connue qui vend des pupusas a tres bas prix, un restau familial qui est un classique. Mais bien que les prix sois plus haut sans être extravagant ça vaut vraiment la peine le decors et le choix au menu sont très interessant le service était impecable, et la nourriture n'a rien perdu de son authenticité. Los planes sur St-denis appartient à la même famille que celui qui ce trouve sur Bélanger. Juste une version un peut plus sophistiqué et la meilleur partie et que l'on ne sent pas la friture en sortant du restaurant."}
{"text":"Los Planes is a family owned restaurant with traditional Salvadorian food with a modern look. The service here is five star worthy! The amazing food is a glimpse to my beautiful country El Salvador! Have you ever tasted your homeland on a dish. Well this evening, I did. And I hope all you fellow Yelpers come by to taste Salvadorian cuisine at it's best!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to so far. The service is amazing, and staff are very friendly. We tried the grilled chicken and fish. Desserts are also great!"}
{"text":"Excellent pupusa and tamarindo drink. Friendly and   Engaging service.   Totally worth the cold of Montreal"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for really good food! Really good pupusas. They serve breakfast all day long, that's just awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent petit restaurant sud américain. Les plats sont copieux et goûteux. J'ai commandé un burrito au poulet. L'assiette est très fourni,  l'accompagnement excellent et l'assaisonnement aussi. Le tout avec un fond musical qui donne envie de se lever et danser."}
{"text":"Not good, not good! Food was epically bland, save for the hot sauce and the acidic slightly spicy salsa verde. I can't speak for the pupusas, because we didn't try any, but stay away from the Mexican dishes. The chilaquiles plate was dry due to lack of enough sauce and the slices of chicken, while satisfactory, were thin and not enough to liven up the dish, and just chips, sauce, a few slices of chicken and a white side sauce made for a very monotonous dish. Nachos were also super boring. It felt like while ever ingredient could stand on its own in terms of taste, when put together, there was just no pizazz. The chips used in the nachos seemed baked, so they weren't greasy, and could probably work well in a tasty dish (read, SEASON your food!), but the cheese on the nachos was like a dusting of small shreds of bland cheese and was not nearly enough to cover the nachos appropriately. One section of the nachos had a small scoop of black beans, which again, were fine, but definitely not seasoned. We went with a coupon, but even with a reduction, I wouldn't go back. Service was very nice, but isn't enough to save the restaurant. Felt like I was eating food court level Mexican in a tad more fancy environment with higher prices. This place seems to survive on its convenient St-Denis location. Margarita wasn't strong, was of low quality, and tasted like lemony water. When I don't seek to have a second margarita and have a hard time drinking my first, that's when you know it's bad!"}
{"text":"I was walking down the street when I saw their signs for a special. $15 and we would get two cocktails and a guacamole.

The cocktails were fine, the guacamole was good but the portion size was extremely small, and the chips were great! 

While we were there, we decided to also try the popusas. I personally don't think popusas are anything special, but they are such a comfort food! 

I think of you are just walking by and are curious, try it!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch! And wonderful service :) $13 for lots of food, fruits, coffee and fresh juice. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"J'ai été agréablement surprise par les saveurs éclatée du ceviche ! Même un peu épicé mais ça fais du bien"}
{"text":"Good food at great prices. Service not so good , we ordered drinks and food which they brought one  at time at different times. Some.of us got our food and others waited 15 minutes later and the drinks was the same. Food and drinks.should.be brought to the talbr the same time. They never filled up.out water glass.
Will not be going back."}
{"text":"While walking down Rue Saint Denis we wandered past this restaurant and decided to try it out since my wife is Salvadoran and we love pupusas.

The restaurant itself had a great ambiance and the waiter was very polite, but the service at this restaurant was incredibly slow especially for the amount of people in the restaurant.

When it came to the food, we had mixed reviews. We started our meal with a glass of jamaica which was delicious. For an appetizer we chose fried plantains which were the best plantains we have had in a very long time. For our main course we ordered both pork and cheese pupusas. The pupusas were huge and well filled, but the filling was extremely salty and difficult to eat.

In the end, the food overall was decent but we needed a ton of water to wash away the saltiness. Also, the service was so slow that it was painful trying to get out the door. We ended up having to pay the meter again because of the delay. 

Overall, it was nice to have some pupusas for lunch, but the service definetly needs to improve."}
{"text":"I hesitate in giving Los Planes three stars because we had a lovely dining experience, but the food was subpar. 

To start off with the good, we (a party of 12) came in late on a Sunday night, and had the whole restaurant to ourselves. The waitstaff were lovely, and the band that night was absolutely killer (and very receptive to our requests). Absolutely no complaints about the ambiance. 

The food itself came out hot, but the seasoning throughout tended to be vastly underwhelming. A lot of the meats were overcooked, the empanadas were overly flowery, and dessert was one-dimensional. 

Some people in our party had previously dined here and reassured us that the food is usually better, so because of my lovely experience here, I'd be willing to give Los Planes another try sometime."}
{"text":"We passed by this restaurant while walking around Montreal and decided to try it out after seeing rave reviews on Yelp.

It was not a very busy day.  There were 4-5 other tables occupied outside other than us.  But there was only one waiter for lunch. The waiter was friendly, but the service was soooo slow. I mean it took 30 minutes to get our chips/guacamole.  So you can just imagine how long it took for the other food to arrive.  Why restaurants don't have more than one server is beyond me.  Even to get water, we had to flag him down.  I noticed that the other tables felt the same way - one couple waited 25 minutes to get their sangria.

Now to the food. They have a note in their menu saying that any of the entrees can be made vegetarian, which is great.  I ordered the following:
- Guacamole: Comes with pita chips. The guacamole is bland, so you should ask for some spicy sauce on the side.
- Pupusas: My husband got this with pork, so I cant say much about what it tasted like. He said he liked it.
- Veggie Burrito (see attached photo):  The burrito was delicious.  It is served on top of a salsa sauce which makes the burrito even tastier.
- Churros: This was terrible.  I was hoping for some amazing churros, but this was super dry and not anything like what I have had in the past.

Overall - great food but super slow service.  If you are in a rush, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night at 9:00, so there was nobody there except us. That being said, you could tell that there's normally a lively atmosphere with a bright interior and two musicians playing live Latin music! They were especially accommodating and even did a cover of despacito after we requested it. 

We started off with the plantains and pupusas. The plantains were sliced unevenly, so some were cooked more thoroughly than others, but overall they weren't bad. The pupusas were reasonably priced at 4 dollars a piece, and were quite average.

The quesadillas had bell peppers to add a little more flavor, but again, nothing exceptional. The major issue came with the pork chops and Plato Tipico. Both were extremely OVERCOOKED. When I ordered the Plato Tipico (sirloin steak), they didn't even ask how I wanted it cooked! It was well done all the way through, as was the porkchops.

We went for a birthday, so they gave everyone churros filled with caramel on the house and sang happy birthday, which was a nice touch, but the churros were slightly stale and chewy.

Overall, it's a restaurant with a nice atmosphere, but average/below average food. Most importantly, STAY AWAY FROM THE MEATS! They'll probably be overcooked!"}
{"text":"Construction on Saint Denis makes shopping difficult but we found this Salvadoran restaurant for dinner.  Great Margaritas and Latin American food.  We had the pork chop with chorizo that came with a small salad, plaintains and rice and it was almost too much food.  Other diners seemed happy with the pitchers of sangria and the finger food.  There was music from a small group playing inside as we sat on the patio."}
{"text":"We were taken care of by Alex, the owner! He was fantastic and the food....well, the food was icing on the cake! Absolutely delicious. Can't wait to come back here on my next Montreal visit."}
{"text":"Just came back from this restaurant and it was amazing. Had the Table d'hôte for 2 grilled meat and it was so tasty. Steak was grilled to perfect. For 86$ it comes with a bottle of wine. What a combo!! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great pupusas (reasonably priced - $4 each - and tasty. We tried the Loca and the cheese-and-jalepeno, and the latter were especially tasty). Also tried the pork-chop-and-chorizo plate ($19) and the sizzling beef and soft tortilla plate ($18). Definitely liked the pork & chorizo plate - generous portion and lots of great flavour. The beef was a bit more standard, though livened up by the side sauces. The lime margueritas on the rocks were delicious ($10 each). Overall a good experience for the price we paid (a $40 ilovemtl deal for what was supposed to be three courses each, though in retrospect they forgot to bring us dessert at the end, so maybe watch out for that if you go there with a deal/coupon)."}
{"text":"Really amazing meal and great sangria. There's a pretty terrace which is great to hang out on. 

The server was very helpful and explained how to eat pupasa (the flower one is incredible and really different from any other flavor I'd tried). :) we'll be back!"}
{"text":"It was a busy  night when we visited this place, I would say the place was understaffed, so my drink and food took quite a while. I had to ask for my drink order about 3 times. 
Although the place was cute and live music was fun, I'm afraid the food was terrible. Considering their prices, the quality was seriously lacking that night. My pork chop was overcooked, dry and almost black. Another two people at our table could not even finish their meal, some of the food was cold. The place has a great atmosphere, but they need to step up their game with cooking process because when the prices are 20-30+ dollars per plate, you simply can't serve inedible, overcooked food."}
{"text":"It was such a beautiful day, and lucked out with a parking space.  Open tables outside so we decided to give it a try.  One other table for two was occupied.  Our waiter was fast with the water, and menus.  After a few minutes he took our order.  We all went with the today's special tortillas soup.  That came out fast.  It was very good and very hot.  Just the way I love my soup.  Then the wait.  I ordered salsa and guacamole and pork skins.  He said he had a special with yucca fries.  I said great.  We waited and waited.  Only one other table mind you.  And waited.  He finally came with our lunches.  Missing my appetizer.  Again asked him if it was coming.  He said yes.  He also said my husbands combo platter which was missing a enchiladas was coming.  Still no appetizer.  We finished our lunch.  Then he brought out my husbands missing enchiladas, but it was a taco instead?  We said nothing cause I didn't want to wait.  He brought me a very small plate of chips and guacamole, but no porkskins and yucca.  I said nothing because I ran out of time on my meter. Lol The food was good.  The service was pleasant but very slow.  I wish his timing or the kitchen timing was on point because they lost a star because of it."}
{"text":"Unbelievably rude. I was waiting to be seated by the hosts table, like a polite person. 2 cute flirty girls rolled up and were given our table despite not having a reservation. When the waiter saw that it was our table, he shrugged and said said they were tourists: not ok, I'll never come back here if that's how they treat people. Plus, they were only coming for drinks whereas we planned to eat a meal and have drinks: fail."}
{"text":"Desperate to find and air conditioned spot to watch the World Cup, we ended up at Los Planes. Admittedly, it wasn't the type of spot we envisioned but it held us over for an exciting game. The lone waiter on this day was nice, though he could have been more aggressive trying to keep people fed and drinking given how few people were there.

We mentioned 2 times that we wanted a pitcher of sangria, but he came out with red. It was pretty, and he mixed it at the table. It didn't have much complexity, though, and usually I like my sangria a little booze-ier. There's also currently a 1L Kronbacher beer special for $10.

While well-priced, the food was pretty meh. The guacamole ($6) was small and needed more flavor. The tacos were also not very tasty and wet, so the tortilla part broke very easily. Maybe we just didn't order the right stuff.

Thankful for the option on that day, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go again.
