{"text":"Well let's just say I'm not crazy about places that make me write my own order.  So didn't start off right. 
Duck was alright, bones were not removed. Chicken dish was also full of bones on every mouthful.  The small little bones that are very annoying. Broccoli was good and shrimp very tasty. 
Service almost non existent. 
Won't return."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago, I went to this restaurant for lunch with one of my friends who just recently tried out the food there. I couldn't image that I would fall in love with the Shanghai food. The dishes we ordered were not just delicious but also with beautiful presentation. The food was so flavorful and tasty that it reminded me of the real Shanghai food when I travelled in January this year in Shanghai. There are also a variety of choices in the menu you can select from with pictures. Actually, the place is not too big but it's a nice decorated ambiance that you can sit back and enjoy your food and time with friends.  I will recommend this place and will come back for trying other dishes..."}
{"text":"This restaurant has gotten worse since I last came. Waiters are unresponsive and size of food declined"}
{"text":"I can see why people may have rated this place so low. The service wasn't the greatest but at the same time I wouldn't say it was horrible. 
But my experience with the food was different. I really liked what we ordered. 

The pan fried buns were really good. One of the best I've had in this city. Meat filling was  a little small though, but very juicy inside and good flavour. Bottom crust is well done. 

Xiao long paos were good, I'd say there were about what I expected from your average dumpling restaurant. 

The crab meat xiao long paos didn't exactly taste like crab meat. So save your money and don't order these. 

The braised pork belly was delicious. A little bit on the sweet side but the meat was very tender and flavourful. 

Beef noodle soup was ok. You can definitely get better else where. Chunks of meat were small and a little tough. Noodles were good, had a nice texture. Soup was ok, but I've had more flavourful. 

There's this salted egg yolk yam. This was really good. I do like salted egg yolk though so I do have a bias here. I like that the yams were a little under cooked so they still have some crunch. 

I would definitely come back here. I guess just be careful of what you order!"}
{"text":"Came back for dinner and was thoroughly disappointed with the meal.

Had a duck dish (boring), veggie w/ ham (completely missing most of the ham that the menu photo showed it having), cabbage with fried ham bits (way too oily), pan fried buns (only good item), xiao long bao (just mediocre), deep fried whole sweet n sour fish (fish not fresh, sauce very bland), and fried rice sticks (overly hard to chew).

After paying the bill, the boss lady didn't even want to give me back my $15 change (she was expecting a huge tip for lame service while their staff was eating lunch in the main dining room at 3pm?).

We won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"My family and I have heard good things about this restaurant so decided to give it a try. We went on a Saturday around 5:30PM. From initial observations most of the tables were empty and the dinner rush hadn't started yet. The lady at the front desk asked if we had a reservation and told us that the entire restaurant was reserved for the evening and if we didn't have a reservation we wouldn't be able to eat there tonight. I'm surprised that there were absolutely no seats left and we weren't even given an option to wait for a table. We were just told to book a reservation the next time or to try again on another day.

After reading some yelp reviews I'm not sure if it's worse the hassle to eat at this restaurant when there are other Shanghai restaurants nearby it..."}
{"text":"The foods is too bad taste like shit , $15 for one small dish of veggie I order spicy chicken dry and all bone . Service is ok"}
{"text":"The food and service was great! Came here craving XLBs and left completely satisfied. We got one of their set meals which included like 10 different dishes (soup, shrimp, rice cakes, jellyfish things, eel...) and I liked each and everyone of them! In my opinion, their food is infinitely better than Ding Tai Fung, and my Shanghai friends agree too."}
{"text":"This is authentic Shanghai food except for the fact that they take credit cards. The food was reasonably priced and came out immediately. Typical to Chinese food it was family-style. The spices in the food were perfect and they had a very expansive menu that is in both Chinese and English. They also have private rooms on the side that you can reserve. We went with a friend who I think made a reservation. It was very busy when we went so I think you probably want to make a reservation if that's possible. There's not really more to say. If you want an authentic food experience you should go here. I'm surprised it had low ratings on yelp. I wonder if it's because people came here to eat and expected an American Chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"The outside kinda look a bit lay back not much outside the inside decor was nice. Had a bit of Shanghai feel to it. There are a few private rooms in this restaurant. 

I went with my brother around 2:30ish. Staff where having lunch.sat down and rhe staff gave us a menu. There are two prices for each dish i bleieve prince in red and another priced in black. If you buy a membership card innot sure if it expries or anything but you get a discount on each dish. I think its about 1$off each dish. The membership card i think they sat was 20$.

we ordered the rice cake and veggy stir fried. I love the rice cake. It was nice and thick, soft yet chewy love that. I added a bit of chilly oil ( more spicy then regular chilly oil you may find in other restaurant).

The siu long bao was pretty good. The soup inside the siu long bao was pretty clean. Didnt have much oil as a lot of other places may have. The dipping vinegar needed a bit more ginger.

Another dish was the mini wonton soup. By far the best ive had so far in a Shanghai restaurant. Pretty filling as there was plenty of the mini wonton to eat. Soup was nice and not too salty for me.

The pan fried meat bun was great. The bun itself was fried perfectly at the bottom. Only thing i see that could be better is a thicker bun. Other then that the flavors were nice and meaty. 

The bill came to about $30. 
I think i will go back for the rice cake loved it the most."}
{"text":"As Shanghainese myself, I love this place!! So far, it's the best one in GTA. We had a Shanghainese get-together there and every dish resonates with us (25 ppl)."}
{"text":"Overall good shanghai food! Have the membership card for the restaurant which allows you to pay a lower price on each dish. My favorite is their pan fried dumpling bun!!! Perfect combination of fried crunchy on the outside and soft juicy dumpling on the inside!"}
{"text":"Not authentic whatsoever, meat was tough and barely there on the bones. Dishes came out super speedy and cold - meaning they cooked it beforehand and just served it when the order came in. Who knows when the dish was cooked? The Shanghainese fried noodle was drenched in oil and a small portion. Staff was basically non existent. Would never recommend."}
{"text":"$11 thinking I would get the drunken chicken/ other selections a bit surprised to get edamame beans with a pinch of shredded chicken. that taste bitter with strong cooking wine taste. See before & after photos.Told the server to ask the chef if there had been a mistake and he could care less and walked off saying he couldn't do anything about it... Rip-off. Heard lots of good things about this place but I'm guessing they are starting to cut corners."}
{"text":"The menu is nice and the pictures of the food looks delicious. Too bad the actual food doesn't even remotely resemble anything in the menu photos. Every time they brought a dish to our table, I had to stop myself from saying we never ordered this! 

Service is bad too. They sat us at a large table with other people and when a small booth opened up, we asked to be moved and they gave a lame excuse that the food has already been entered to come to this table. Really? 

Food quality and taste is mediocre at best and surely does not justify the price. Seems that any restaurant with the word \"fine\" in the name is compensating for something... If you want to provide a fine dining experience, provide better service and food...

Really miss the original King of King Chinese restaurant at this location. Every restaurant that came after (Qing, Li's House, and now this one) has progressively gotten worse... Either they better shape up and serve food that looks like the menu photos and actually tastes good, or I'll be looking forward to visiting a new restaurant in the near future. 

Oh, and they tried to get us to buy the membership card when placing the order. Glad we waited until the food came! 

The Shanghai restaurant on Hwy 7 near Bayview (in the same plaza as Ocean/Steam kitchen) is so much better!"}
{"text":"I had Chinese New Year dinner with family at this place this year. Service is 5+++++++! Food 4, I guess as a shanghainese person i have higher standards for shanghainese food. The good thing about this restaurant is that, lots dishes i couldn't find in Toronto is at this place.  love it, gonna be back for sure"}
{"text":"so this place was generally OKAY nothing to special about it

i went here on saturday with my family for dinner. i believe we ordered like 8 dishes
- 2 orders of soup dumplings (they were alright..nothing special)
- some dumb fried rice squares (i didn't eat it but my mom and sister looked like they were having a miserable time eating them LOOOL)
- some kind of beancurd pork soup (again nothing special.. was a whopping $26 like holy god..it wasn't even that flavourful and it wasn't like some kind of special delicacy was in it either)
- spicy glass noodle (ain't that bad actually.. it was spicy with a teency bit of sourness to it)
- some kind of fish (not worth it)
- pork belly with eggs (it was aiight)
- i don't remember the last item 

everything came to a total of $108 like dear lord we could've went to a buffet (we weren't necessarily too full had to make a trip to t&t LOL) but yeah overall it's alright . wouldn't rly come here again though"}
{"text":"Recently discovered this place although they have been around for a while. I thought this was a quiet hidden place, but they get quite full during dinner time especially for weekends. 
They serve some unique Chinese/Shanghai food that you don't normally find. They have an extensive menu!! 
The dishes here always taste fresh, though on the oily side. The presentation often looks a bit different than the photos. For example the sweet and sour fish looks nothing like the photo, but it was tasty. I also recommend the pan fried buns, they are so juicy. 

Get the VIP card for $20 if you plan to visit more than once. It saves you between $1-4 per dish. No expiry."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. We ordered their siu long bao, pan fried bao, Shanghai stir fry noodles and the siu mai. The siu long bao skin was too thick for my liking and they make it too big compared to Ding Tai Fung & Asian Legend. The Shanghai noodles tasted ok with the veggies but really greasy. The pan fried buns and siu mai were ok, nothing special. I also wanted a hot soymilk but it only comes in cold. The waiter said he can \"microwave\" it for me which took awhile...and when it came back it was just warm, didn't taste good (stick to the cold soy milk). As for the service, wasn't that good but the place looked like an authentic Shanghai restaurant. They have these VIP rooms in there which looked pretty nice but have a min order. I don't think I'll be coming back since this place is on the pricier side compared to others and the food was just average."}
{"text":"Mid range Chinese restaurant. All of their items on the menu are available without having to preorder, even the complex ones. Fast service. Clean. High quality food. Stable quality. But there is one thing I REALLY HATE. They serve rabbit dishes. I can't ever come back here again. Just a personal preference and principle thing."}
{"text":"ShiKuMen carries some pretty authentic Chinese dishes and particularly, Shanghai dishes. I had flashbacks of myself in Shanghai when I was going through the menu. 

Food is a bit pricey, but the portions are good. I like that they didn`t try to westernize the dishes. My biggest complaint is that the food was way too salty. I expect Chinese restaurants to be salty, but this is next level saltiness. The food would`ve tasted significantly better if they didn`t add too much salt.

Service was fast but it was hard to flag a server down."}
{"text":"First time here and not impressed with service so far. The signage outside made it look like a larger restaurant. But the inside is tiny. 

The two dishes we ordered (no rice provided) came. To say unique is an over statement. I can cook these dishes better, and I can't cook.

Duck was dry as heck and the other dish is a mini ohmlette dumpling. I can make this at home.

Very disappointed and will not be coming back.

Only saving grace, at least the washroom was clean. Dang nab bit, no paper towels..."}
{"text":"Love the food, hate the service.

As a person came from Shanghai I feel like I kinda have a saying on the authenticity of the food. I will have to give credits for the duck soup and some appetizers. Steamed little bun is only ok. But pan fried bun is better than most of other shanghaiese restaurants in Toronto. Still not the real ones I ate back home though.. However service is really crappy. Very hard to find a spot and waiter's attitude is unacceptable. Will go again but only on certain days that I really want home food"}
{"text":"6 adults and 2 kids came here for dinner. We reserved a small private room. This room costs $260 excluding tax.  The philosophy behind the costs associated to the private rooms is that you order dishes equal to the value of the private rooms. In our case we had to order dishes that's worth $260. 

The restaurant is clean and well decorated. I am Shanghainese and I find the menu is extremely extensive, a good thing because there's hardly any authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the GTA. 

Of all the Shanghainese restaurants I've been to in Canada, this place has the best Pan Fried Soup Buns. It served perfectly browned at the bottom and juicy filling in the inside. Deep Fried Ribbon Fish was fried perfectly. Crispy and moist. Same with Deep Fried Belt Fish, really great coating and was superb. Bamboo shoots is delicious!  Yi Duo Xian Soup is super super delicious, it brings me back to Shanghai. Fried Eel was awesome, never had it with soy sauce coating. Hong Shao Rou with Eggs is to die for!  The fat just melts in your mouth, very nice!

Great dinner and service. Friendly staff and the owners of this restaurant are both Shanghainese, they know what they are doing.  Will most definitely be back. 

Pro tip:

1) Call to reserve. 

2) If your lost on ordering, ask the server for suggestions. They'll look after you."}
{"text":"2:15 pm Tuesday, time for lunch.

Definitely a time for lunch as when I walked in Shanghai Shikumen Restaurant, everyone working there was having lunch. Awkward moment, should I just walk out without anyone noticed me but one of the wait staff came over to seat me at one of the tables.

What to order? A big colourful menu. Dim sum and noodle might be the best choice for a single person.

Special Spicy Noodle Soup with Meat Sauce ($8.99) was pretty good. The noodle was cooked with a nice bite and soup base was well seasoned. A little touch of spiciness which I cannot call it spicy at all.

Apparently, the restaurant is closed from 2:30-4:30 on weekdays but even when I was leaving the restaurant at 3:00, the OPEN sign was till on.

There are quite a few private rooms that are good for groups. 

I might come back to try some other items on the menu but in no rush."}
{"text":"Actually rating on this place was not so good but then I realized  not was done by a chinese. Shanghai cuisine is quite unique and has a different taste yo most chinese food. I try to avoid it but still like it.
Today the rabbit was really good. Don't think it was shanghaineese but i liked it. So was the bambo and spice lotus. Beef soup was more of a thai style and of course the Xiao long bap both steamed and fried were excellent. 
Since my wife is from Shanghai I have a feeling we will be back here."}
{"text":"Normally when I come there is a long lineup. I guess this is a sign that the food is good. I came a few times and never had any issues. Food tastes authentic and the decor is pretty nice. I'd recommend this place if you want Shanghai food."}
