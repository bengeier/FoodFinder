{"text":"This place serves fish 'n' chips that'll blow your mind. The fish is cooked as you wait and the batter is light and done to perfection. The chips aren't too greasy and you even get the option of 'scraps' (all the crispy bits in the fryer!). The best fish n chips we've had for a long time. Just missed the Scottish 'chippy sauce' we're used to!! The only reason I knock a star off was because the lady that served us was rude and off hand. We got a take-out and she made a deal of not understanding our accents. She also didn't realise I'd given her £20 and not ten and had an attitude when I stated a needed change of £20. Maybe she was having a bad day or doesn't like Scots!"}

{"text":"We dropped into Capplemans around  6pm on a grey Tuesday night in June and it was busy and bustling with a mix of locals and tourists.  We waited at the front of the shop as instructed by the clearly written sign which is prominently displayed as you enter the cafe (a fellow who ignored this instruction and found himself a table was greeted with the lovely put down of: \"I suppose you will be wanting a table for one then sir\"). After a couple of minutes we received a warm welcome from the young waitress and we were seated at a window table.  The decor at Capplemans is very 1980's - think of an elderly relatives living room and you will get the idea - and the service has similar old school charm (if you are following instructions). This approach seemed to suit the majority of the clientele and while it's a little bit dated it did not detract from what was a very fine fish supper.  I had a whale of a haddock with a small chips and a portion of mushy peas which came included in the price. Crisp batter, fresh fish and well cooked chips - it was a very tasty meal and even with a bottle of Black Sheep to wash it down I struggled to make it to the finish line. B was similarly pleased with her cod supper and also struggled with the portion size.  We left after the best part of an hour with our wallet hardly any lighter and in serious danger of slipping into a food coma. This is a good thing ....."}
