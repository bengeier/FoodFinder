{"text":"Got a coupon online for dinner AYCE. Decent food quality and price. Great services, provide good recommendations when we don't know what to order."}
{"text":"BE AWARE! The price ($25.99, +$2 for weekends) for the AYCE hot pot/bbq does not include the cost of $6, $8, or $10 for the POT, depending on how many soup base you want the pot to hold.  This is the first time I've been to an ayce hot pot place that charges you a fee for the pot and doesn't include it.  Yes a POT the waiter basically says the 'soup base' is no extra charge, the fee is for the pot.  In other words you're paying a rental fee for the pot.  Not worth it at all.  Can't comment on the food quality since we walked out after clarifying the extra cost for the pot."}
{"text":"This place is a game changer ! The hot pot was good and had a large assortment of ingredients you could order from. What makes this place different from other all you can eat hot pot restaurants is that it also offers all you can eat grilled food too! The top of the pot has a grill attachment where you cook meats and veggies in addition as cooking in the soup bases. The staff were very attentive and helpful and worked quickly to replenish the meats and veggies we ordered. We also ordered a pitcher of watermelon juice that was $10 but refreshing and satisfying. When ordering soup based, you can choose one soup option for $6, 2 soup portions for $8 or 4 soup options for $10. I'm the end, after tax and tip we each paid $40."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best hotpot places in Toronto. First and foremost, staff is extremely friendly and place is incredibly clean. Ingredients are very fresh and vegetables are crisp and not wilted. Marinated items are very well balanced especially for a szechuan pallete. To top it all off, if you get tired of soupy boiled food, you can grill your food! Definitely recommend and I am now a regular."}
{"text":"False advertisement!!! I was forced to pay for the soup base and extra tax given that I had already group purchased it online! The actress is so rude and awful, I was so scared! The worst restaurant ever!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the service. The lady( I think she is the owner) is really nice and welcoming, which is not common in Chinese restaurants (I am Chinese so I can say that). I had the spicy pig intestine noodle and it is fairly good. The only thing I think that could be improved is the soup, which could be a bit richer. But I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came into this restaurant late one night and only had time to order once before last call.  Since it was late I can't comment on the wait time or the service, but this place takes your order efficiently by tablet and the waiters will bring you the food/sauces as you are ordering .  The hotpots can accommodate up to four soups - but each additional portion will cost you.  In fact, the one-soup option will still cost extra.  There are definitely some interesting soup bases to try out - a hokkaido soup caught my eye and is actually pretty good.  The hotpot has a grill built-in on the top, a great and innovative way to eat ayce.  The only thing that concerned me was I kept hitting the side of the grill (as it is literally right on top of the pot) and burnt myself a few times.  Yes, it can be avoided but isn't the most user-friendly.  Overall, the meat quality is average, though they do have pork belly which you don't find all the time at hotpot.    One thing that really bothered me the entire time was that the seat is much lower than the table.  This greatly affected my experience because it isn't comfortable to eat when the table is so high.  Not sure if this is how ayce do it to ensure people don't eat there for an extended amount of time."}
{"text":"Location/Environment/Service: - Within a new plaza by Midland & Finch, easy to find with lots of parking. - Big restaurant with lots of seating; good for groups - Most staff are Mandarin based, but do know English  - You can make a reservation online (with a text confirmation), but I would suggest calling after to make sure it's reserved.  There was a slight miscommunication on the date/time.  Food: What's special about this place is that you can hot pot and BBQ at the same time.  The BBQ plate is on top of the hot pot and it transmit heat from below upwards - so expect the meat to take a little bit of time to cook.  They use a oil paper filter for you to grill so it doesn't stick to the plate or become all charcoal.  The staff will attentively replace the filter once it's oily.  The meal was a little expensive (~$40/person), similarly to most ayce hot pot place you see nowadays.  They have many soup base for you to choose from - and you can either do it half/half or single or into quarters (so dip food here and there!).  Food selection is pretty standard, nothing out of the ordinary.  But what I did not like too much was the freshness and the oiliness.  Some of the food we ordered didn't look too fresh (as if it was still frozen or put out too long).  The mix with the BBQ made everything a lot oily too - so my stomach couldn't handle much of it.  If you want to try BBQ and hot pot at the same time, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Awful service, my friend and I came here during a not so busy dinner service and it took ages for our orders to come out.In fact, we had to constantly reorder and remind them while our soup was boiling away. Even when they brought our order, it was missing tons of stuff.  Will never visit again."}
{"text":"This place is the best of both worlds!! They have AYCE hot pot and bbq. The interior is clean and the seats and tables are comfortable. The dinner price for the weekend was $27.99/adult. They said there is free dessert served while quantities last, I did not get to try that.   There are options to choose 1, 2, or 4 soup pots. We opted for the 4 soup pot as we wanted to try their soup bases. We tried the Japanese Seaweed soup, Tomato base soup, Si-chuan Mala soup, and the clam and bitter melon soup (additional $1). They were very flavourful and had lots of ingredients inside. My favourite was the Japanese Seaweed soup and the Tomato soup base. They were both very rich in flavour.   You have to order the dipping sauces which come in small bowls. I was disappointed that they ran out of Hoisin sauce (my must have sauce for hot pot). Nonetheless, in the end, I barely dipped my food in the sauces as the soup base was already enough flavour for me.   Then you order the veggies, bbq meats and hot pot, meat balls, seafood that you want. The food was all very fresh and tasty. The nice thing about this restaurant is that they cut off all of the legs and whiskers of the shrimp so you can eat it easier.   We ordered a jar of fresh watermelon juice ($10) and a can of Jia Duo Bao.   The bbq grlil was slow and hot, giving you enough time to cook the food without burning. The servers also come when the sheet on your grill is oily. They wipe the grill for you and change your paper to a new one. The first time the server did it, she didn't say anything and just clipped the paper away while I was about to turn the meats. But the second server told us that he was going to do so.   Be careful not to leave the metal spoon in the hot pot as the handle is also metal, which can burn your hand.   They also put any extra food that doesn't fit on your table on a cart beside your table which was easy and useful. Each table is also provided with a pack of tissues.   The service and food was good overall. It's a newer experience having both bbq and hot pot together. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Services are great, food is fresh. Angus Beef is the bomb. Buffet style. Hot pot and BBQ together. They give u good amount of food each time you order."}
{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0  Here's an update to my previous review. I contacted the event organizer and apparently they have resolved the issue with the restaurant. However, I have also been informed that there have been others who were still getting charged for the soup base.   The fact it was the last day of Asia Food Fest, there is no point to continue to dive into this subject. My advice is to do your due diligence and confirm with the restaurant on future promotions to avoid any misunderstanding.  We were given the opportunity to visit the restaurant again for a complimentary meal as an apology to our previous experience.  This time we had the grilled fish combo ($39.99) for 2 people with tomato soup base. It was alright for what it is, but it was not worth the money if we were to actually pay for it. You can get a better grilled fish hotpot elsewhere with more options and a broth that is an actual fish soup base at a cheaper price."}
{"text":"This is a very interesting way of hot pot. You can bbq on top of the pot. The food is very fresh and the service pretty good. We will come back again."}
{"text":"I'm torn between giving this a 3 and giving this a 4. I have a number of reasons why. First, I must say that I came for the Asian Food Festival, and used a deal that got me their beef/lamb hotpot, 1 soup base per person, and 1 yakult drink for $19.99. I'm not sure whether the servers completely understood the deal, or whether I misunderstood the deal, or whether there was an extra charge I did not know about, because when the bill came to us at the end of the meal, there was an extra $8 fee for what the server called a pot fee. We had 2 soup bases between 3 people (which should have been included in our deal). A 2 soup base pot costs $8. I'm guessing they charged us for the soup bases, even though when I told them our soup bases were part of our deal, they said the $8 wasn't for the soup, but for the pot. Once again, not sure whether I didn't understand something, or they didn't.  Downsides to this restaurant first. Their seats are slightly low, so it's somewhat awkward trying to dip into the pot, especially because the grill gets in the way. For those of you who don't know, Han Shi Fang has cool pots where you can cook hot pot style at the bottom, and you have a small grill on top of that so you can grill meat if you so choose. Since the grill is hot, you want to avoid touching it when you get stuff from your boiling hot pot. The seat levels make this slightly awkward because your arms might not be at the right levels to dip into your hot pot easily. Food-wise, the food was pretty fresh, and mostly of good quality (save for the gluten), but the white mushrooms had dirt on them. I'm also not fond of the way they cleaned up their grill. They have a piece of parchment paper (or something similar) on their grill to keep your meat from sticking to the grill. When they change this, they come around with a tray, grab your paper (food and all), put it on their tray (sometimes with other people's food junk already on the tray), put down a new piece of paper, then put your food onto this new piece of paper). I'm not fond of having other people's bones and stuff within that close proximity to my food. They also do this without warning, so every time they did this, I felt like my food was being stolen from me. Oh. A few of their waiters don't speak English. I asked for green onions three times. The first time, they forgot. The second time, we were given cilantro (how? o.O). The third time, they finally came.  Highlights included their very flavorful soup bases (we had pork bone and satay), among other things. When they add water to your pot, they don't just add water. They add broth. It means the soup bases don't get diluted. They have a number of dipping sauce options, which you order, and they bring to you in separate bowls. While I like the separation, the quantities of each are very random and they do take up space on the table. Their pork belly is sliced in rounds (which I find very pretty, and I know is more expensive, at least in grocery stores). Their veggies are fresh. Their yakult is pretty good too (although $3.5 a la carte).  This next part is both a downer and a highlight. Our menu said they serve Angus beef hotpot. We ordered this Angus beef, and we got beef. It didn't look like Angus, but it was quite tasty. Partway through our meal, we decided to get another round of beef, and the waiter asked if we wanted lean beef or fatty beef. This was the first time in our numerous rounds that we had been given a beef option. We opted for one of each, and we got one plate of the beef we'd been eating all night, and another beef of incredibly gorgeous, well-marbled beef. While I was fairly in awe of the well-marbled beef, I was also slightly miffed that we had been given the other stuff prior to this, especially because we found out so late into our meal that we only managed to get 2 plates of this beautiful beef before we tapped out. This beef was so magical that grilled and unsalted, it was still the best part of the entire meal by far.  I'd definitely come again for more of that beef, but only on a weekday (where they have the $19.99 beef/lamb hotpot without the yakult and soup bases) or during this promotion that's going on right now."}
{"text":"Brilliant idea to have both hot pot and BBQ combined.  Selection of meat was quite good and cleanliness was pretty good.  I like how the parchment paper on the grill was changed frequently.  Service was pretty good.  The only thing is charging extra for the basic soup should be included in the price.  I liked how there was dumplings.  I wish there was fried rice or fried noodle option for the kids."}
{"text":"Went on a sat nite for dinner.  Very pleased.  Surprised restaurant was only 1/3 full.  Even when we left at 8.  Loved having both soup hotpot and bbq.  Pork bone soup and spicy mala were both great.  Just right not too salty.   Don't mind paying $8 for soup base.  So good don't need to use much dipping sauce at all.  Fresh ingredients:  beef, lamb, shrimp, mussel, squid.  Beef ribs, ch wings, sausage for bbq.  Instant noodle soaked up all the mala soup was delicious.  Love that u can also get steamed dumplings and bbq pork buns.   Servers came by 2x to change wax paper on bbq.  Tea always refilled.  Would visit again.  Love this place.  No more emperor or little lamb for us."}
{"text":"Went there on a sat night for hotpot.. and their air conditioning was broken down. It was like having hotpot in a sauna ==\" not a great experience. Overall the food was just ok.. and it was pricy."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was a little out of my element here. I enjoy hot pot but most of my experience has been the home cooked variety. I found the menu here a little confusing so I left it up to my dining companions to do the ordering.  The first thing I noticed about the pot that was brought to the table, it had a grill on top. Ahhh, first time I've seen that. Nice! The best of both worlds.  The food started coming fast and furious. I wasn't sure what to throw in the broth or what to throw on the grill. A little of both I guess. I had to mix my own dipping sauce? Okay, I guess. Good thing I know how to cook.  The food was good but I found the overall experience a little confusing and a bit fast paced for my dining preference. Maybe it was just the friends I went with. Pigs! ;)  I also found it a bit pricey. Maybe my next visit will be more pleasurable. Yes, I would go back."}
{"text":"Is not your average all u can eat Chinese restaurant.  Is on the expensive side, I spent $40 including tax and tips.  However, I liked the idea of BBQ & hot pot all in one.  Is a good place to chill with friends when you have time to kill.  Also food is fresh & the beef slices are delish.  I dun like the meat balls however, I think is too soft.  Must add $10 for the four flavours soup base!"}
{"text":"I'll first say that we are not huge hot pot fans and this was our first time trying it in a restaurant. So we are not experts in mixing sauces but we are always up for something new and wanted to try it out. With all the different hot pot restaurants, this one stands out because there is the BBQ grill on top and you can choose up to 4 soup bases. We are a family of 2 adults and 3 kids and we went on a Friday afternoon. There is no difference in price for lunch and dinner and there is a $2 up charge for it being a weekend. Their weekend starts on Friday I guess. But with that, you get a free dessert....while quantities last. I'll get to that later.  We had trouble finding the restaurant at first but after calling and being navigated we got there. We got seated and since it was our first time, the hostess who speaks English was very helpful. She helped us order, and when the food came, even came and helped us cook the BBQ a bit. As for soups, we ordered satay, pork bone, corn and tom yum because another reviewer said that tom yum was the table favorite. We liked the pork bone best. The corn was sweet which was good but can't take too much of it, the Tom yum was too acidic because of too much lime and the satay was ok.  Overall, the food was alright. We saw it as eating and entertainment as the kids enjoyed cooking. The $130.00  bill comes and I ask her about the free dessert. Immediately she says \"sold out\". My response was \"you're sold out at 2 in the afternoon?!\"  She says \"tomorrow\". Whatever!  They don't intend on giving any dessert on Friday I guess but still charges the extra money. I also realized after that they didn't bring out the short ribs we ordered because it was probably the most expensive and hoping we would forget about it....and we did.  I would have given more stars but I find the business practices are a bit shady. Overall I would not go back nor would I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night at around 7:15pm and the place was packed so we had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. Menu is mostly in Chinese with some items listed in English. Waitresses spoke mostly Mandarin but they did have one person that took care of all the Cantonese customers. If you can't read Chinese then make sure you bring someone that does...lol  I do not usually go to hotpot places so we ordered based off what we saw other tables ordering and added items to fit our taste a bit more. The results of our ordering turned into AYCE hotpot/BBQ all in one with seafood. I wish we looked at the price more carefully but we ended up paying $26.95 per person +$8 for a sweet plum drink (served in large bottle to share) +$6 for house special soup base.  For the BBQ portion I liked how the meat was marinated for our beef ribs but the quality of the cuts were as bad as they get. Very little meat on the ribs and what little meat was there looked as if it went through a grinder. We also got fish fillets and shrimps which tasted good when sprinkled with spices and absorbing all the marinate from the beef ribs.  For the hotpot portion everything tasted good. We opted for beef and lamb for our thin cuts.   Overall the food was good and service was fast. But I can't forgive the poor quality cuts for the beef ribs and I found the price to be a bit on the high side. Plus it would be nice if there was an English menu."}
{"text":"Lack of staff, slow service! They only have one staff to take order and clean up, one staff to deliver food! I saw the boss just sitting in the room with friends and not planning to help. Also, The staff didnt take the right order, just give out some of the food i ordered. When i asked for it, they just asked me to wait! I will never go back and i wouldnt recommend anyone to go there, the food and the service not worth the price at all."}
{"text":"Having both Hotpot and BBQ at the same time is genius ! This is AYCE. Recommend going on weekends for a better BBQ menu because it's very limited on weekdays. Overall good selection for hotpot foods. They have some cooked food also (sao long bao, chicken wings, etc). You can do 1, 2 or 4 different soup bases in one pot. English is not their first language but they do have an English menu, so just ask for it. Service for ordering can be slow because the servers who don't speak English tend to run away to find the English speaking server (which is usually only 1 specific person). However, once you have your order in, food comes out pretty fast. Comfortable seating and clean. No dessert included but there's plenty of bubble tea shops in the mall for those with a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"This place you can have BBQ and hotpot at the same time. The top part of the pot is BBQ, and surrounding the bottom is hot pot. The best part is that if the grill is dirty, they will change the paper for you.  This place was kind of expensive, and the service bell at our table wasn't working. They took our order with an tablet in real time which they won't miss any order like many places."}
{"text":"We are picky eater. I think to properly review this place, I'd need to break it down to categories. Soup Base - We had the tom yum and satay dual soup base. I always loved tom yum because it is spicy with a kick of sourness, which made the, otherwise, greasy soup base taste refreshing and not so greasy. Han Shi Fang's Tom Yum soup base is good. I won't say it's the best. What really impressed me was the satay soup base, which I didn't really consider ordering at first. Thanks to my friends, we tried this soup base. It is very different compared to the Cantonese version, in a good way. It has more flavour and does not taste like it is squeezed out of a tube (if you know what I mean).  Food - They are all okay. There's def no premium meat under the AYCE package so I am happy that they all taste fresh-ish. There's a decent selection. I just wished that there are more stuff for BBQ. Maybe lamb skewer? Please add that to the menu? BBQ - I am slightly disappointed on the quality of BBQ you'd get from this pot. I guess it is probably the best it can deliver from a dual function pot. There's no charcoal or open fire under the meat. Therefore, I felt like the BBQ food taste like something out of a stir fry. Service - Service is pretty awesome. They kept on changing our BBQ sheet and came frequently to take new food orders (hopefully without judging us).  Price - This is def a pricey place. We each paid 40. I'd be happier if it's managed around 35.  I gave this place 5/5 although I really wanted to give it 4/5. But I think innovation deserves at least a star."}
{"text":"The BBQ + Hotpot concept is interesting, but there isn't much variety for the bbq meat. Also, the hotpot shrimp didn't taste very fresh. Service is ok, but there are only 2 servers. I ca imagine it could be a bit slow if there are more customers. Price is pretty high for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Another ayce hot pot restaurant to open. Their pots actually have built in grill on the top layer which made this place a bit more unique. In addition, their pots can accommodate up to 4 broths. Since none of my in laws can take spices, we stuck to just two broths - pork bone and seaweed.   Our orders began piling onto our table as our server were still taking our order - talk about efficiency! There were lots of veggies and meat options to choose from. Definitely get their sliced lamb and shrimp+pork wonton! I must had eaten 3 whole plates of lamb myself! And don't forget to try grilling their head on shrimp and angus beef! As for desserts, they gave complimentary yam purée with drizzled berry sauce over potato chips which we'd never seen before. Although it was tasty we found It to be a bit too heavy (basically eating mashed potato) and wished they served regular sweets like ice cream or pudding instead.   And for condiments, they didn't have many sauce options (especially the hot sauce - they only had hot chili oil. Also my husband said their BBQ sauce was off brand and had a strange aftertaste). Price - definitely pricier than most ayce hotpot restaurants. They charge additionally for the pot depending on the number of broths you choose. Even with one broth, it was an inevitable $6 surcharge. Should they just include the extra cost in their price per person in the first place? Overall, we enjoyed the food and service. Just not sure if it was worth the price."}
{"text":"Environment was clean but food is awful. The lamb they have didn't taste like lamb, and the chicken wings for grill doesn't have the proper meat texture.  I didn't even know what kind of meat it was.   As for the mashed shrimp (xia hua) I couldn't taste the shrimp AT ALL. In other hot pot places you can taste the shrimp and feel the texture, however, in this place I didn't know what it was made of.   The spicy hot soup base was also tasteless. We ordered medium spicy but I couldn't feel the spiciness at all...it basically had no taste.   With the awful food ingredients, they charge you the same price as other hotpot places who offer way better quality of food.  I wasn't even full despite it was a ayce place because the food quality was so bad and I was very disappointed.  I will never return to this place again, take your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here because I heard that you can hotpot and bbq both at the same time - quite interesting I must say but it is a gimmick. The hotpot soup bases were pretty good though - the corn soup base had a strong corn taste which I liked. The tomato soup base was also good too, rich tomato flavor. However, I do think this place does mediocre in both bbq and hot pot and not relatively better in either. It's a good concept to fulfill people that want to eat both types of cooking, but I would prefer going to a place that specializes in each area itself.  The food is expensive, I think it costed around $35 per person on the weekend, doesn't include drinks either. The food quality was good, but it really bothered me how they kept serving such small portions. I went with 5 other friends so total 6 people, so you would think they should at least serve enough for 1 piece per person. But nope, we asked for sausages, they only gave 4 pieces, asked for melon and they gave 4 slices, asked for beef balls and served 3? Now that is just ridiculous. Also, the servers don't speak English - one of the server actually gave me a look like 'shame on you' for not understanding what he was saying to me in Mandarin - really rude in my opinion."}
{"text":"A unique way to have both hot pot and bbq grilled tray together. All you can eat buffet, and try their banana milkshake and bbq beef"}
{"text":"Overall a really below average experience. Made a reso on Yelp and received a confirmation email AND text saying it was good to go, but when we arrived the host said \"my boss doesn't give me the online reservation info\" and we had to wait 30 minutes for a free table. What's the point of having that functionality when you're not even going to check???  Food: while the pot is an interesting idea (korean bbq on top, hot pot at the bottom with 4 separate sections for different soup bases), we found it to be more annoying than useful. The oil from the bbq part was overflowing down to the soup and made it super unappetizing. The hot pot part was too small (because of the 4 sections) and didn't give a satisfying hotpot experience. The meats and veggies were mediocre, nothing noteworthy but it was fresh.  Service was pretty typical of an asian place - hurried, dismissive and inattentive.  For about $30 person (we just ordered the basics, no extras) I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"REVIEW ON THEIR LUNCH SPECIALS.  I didn't choose to have their hot pot/BBQ option since it was the middle of the day. Han Shi Fang has lunch options, so if you want to try this place out without spending too much money, read my review.   Most of their food options were spicy. The people I was with (including me) do not tolerate spicy foods too well although we all enjoy them. While I was in the washroom, my friends told the waiter to put less spice in everything. That made me laugh when they told me.  We ordered their \"Never Forget Chicken\" as well as three different noodle bowls. One of my friends had the one with ribs, I had the one with beef, and I can't remember what my other friend had. Despite asking for less spice, the spiciness of the dishes was numbing even though it wasn't that spicy. I don't know if that makes sense, but you really have to eat here to understand what I mean. The broth for the noodles looks like lava, but it was all very delicious. Unfortunately, the Never Forget Chicken was very forgettable even though I did enjoy it.   The one server at the time was very friendly. If all their employees are like him, then I can understand why this place has so many good reviews.  I might want to return to try their hot pot option, but coming back for lunch would be good as well.  3.5"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the cleanliness, the option of both bbq and hotpot and a good variety. Now the bad part is mainly the service-- the restaurant was slow, we were the only large group that came by, yes we did have a lot of people but they only had one server for our two tables. And the one server was the only one who could speak English. When I went up to pay, and asked for my separate bill, the three servers standing behind the counter looked at me with confusion. I felt really bad that the only one server who spoke English handled everything.  Now the food: good variety but to be honest, not worth the price. I'm not sure what they marinated their meat in, but it broke into pieces and didn't quite taste like meat once it was cooked. The marinated chicken was almost WHITE, not an ounce of color was left on it. And when it was cooked it basically disintegrated when you tried to bite into it. The soup bases were very delicious but the meat quality was questionable.   Poor service, odd meat and lack customer service. Not worth the price. A Also there is no obvious sign on the restaurant. I spent 10 minutes looking for it."}
{"text":"Food ***1/2 Service * Ambience **  A group of 10 of us came for AYCE hotpot.  I hadn't been to hotpot in over a decades so it was fun to have it again with such a large group.   It's in Scarborough and many of us live downtown, so we battled a  weekday rush hour to get here.  The start of our experience was a bit tough.  Most of us arrived at around ~7:40pm. with a serious appetite (it's Food Club so no one dares to mid-afternoon snack and spoil their hunger.).  It took is 20 minutes and multiple requests to order a beer and probably another 20 min to get our hotpot/grills and soups and raw meats.  Unfortunately a lot of the herbs and spices were distributed at one end of the table and various meats, veggies etc were concentrated and not evenly distributed.  With 3 hotpots in action there was a lot of initial passing around before getting settled.    Throughout the meal, we re-ordered multiple items or new items and had to re-request them if they didn't come... Some never came.    Quality of the meets was good.   Stay away from the lamb because from a flavour standpoint it doesn't fit with the meal.  If you are coming, make sure you choose the Tom Yum (Thai) soup.   It's incredible and was the table favourite."}
