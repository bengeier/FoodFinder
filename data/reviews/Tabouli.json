{"text":"$6.20 for a dinner was tempting, but the food was very mediocre. I normally don't order from random places on a whim but went against better judgment since it was convenient for me to pick up a quick meal on the way home so I could head back out in time for my evening plans.

I ordered the Beef Kabob Dinner - the meat was charred and dry. I've had way better of the same stuff elsewhere. Worst of all, I felt sick after eating the food resulting in frequent trips to the toilet! HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"My go to place for Shawarma after work. I used to go to Anoush or Liberty Schawarma but Tabouli's is definitely better. The chicken is actually moist and not dry. Personally, I like the shawarma plates - make sure to get enough of the garlic sauce. Cheap and delicious ..What's not to like?"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for lunch. Portions are huge and the food is delicious! I usually order the chicken salad which comes with chick peas, lentils, tabouli, and cabbage. Chicken is always fresh and I feel good/pretty healthy coming here unlike a lot of places you find in the food court."}
{"text":"I've tried so many Middle Eastern restaurants. Comparing to others, the food here is below average and the customer service is HORRIBLE. I've never seen staff that rude. One star is a lot for this place."}
{"text":"My colleagues love this place for lunch.  One of them works about 6 blocks away and he will trek over in a suit in hot, humid Toronto summer weather to feast on the chicken shawarma plate at Tabouli's.   

- Good, consistent output of fresh food.  
- Tremendous value for the price.  
- The attitude is free (mostly from one cranky family member/server--the rest are kind folk)"}
{"text":"I had the lamb shank. Not a ton of meat, but it was good. Then tons of rice and salad. Filling, but not tasty."}
{"text":"I have never had middle eastern food before and always wanted to try it, so I ordered their Beef Shawarma dinner box.  I was going to order Beef Kabob but they ran out, so I just a little bit bummed on it.  Service was good and food was great, cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch, portions are big as you get a ton of food so that is definitely right on the mark. And for like 7.50 for the schwarma dinner/plate that is a great deal these days. Now with all that out of the way, the quality of the food is just OK standard food court type food.

If you are looking for a cheap lunch with a healthy portion go here. If not, venture somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very sub-par. Especially if you are expecting real Arab food. If you have to get food from here, get extra white sauce because otherwise it is very bland. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Price: $5 to $7
Quantity: lots

---

Located at CBC food court (simcoe place) in the PATH.

Boxes of rice, salad, potatoes, and meat average $7 before tax.
Basic salad includes lettuce and tomatoes.

There are falafel wraps available for $5.
Portion sizes are large, meat tastes alright.

If you're looking for something inexpensive to fill you up, this isn't a bad option."}
{"text":"This was an okay choice for a quick and inexpensive meal. Nothing great and some of the chicken was a little tough. But it was tasty and filling."}
{"text":"First review on yelp, because of how disgusting this food was.

Yes, I may be biased growing up in Scarborough with authentic shawarma, but this place does not serve anything remotely close to shawarma, and I was optimistic coming here. 

Got the beef shawarma salad, as these places usually pile the rice high.

The beef was stewing in a tomatoey sauce, what? Gross. (See image for proof)

The salads, were tasty though and definitely a lot more authentic than their meat. 

Wouldn't go back, wouldn't recommend."}
