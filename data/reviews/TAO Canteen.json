{"text":"NIce place. Food is good. Price is very fair. THe portion sizes are also good. You can order a dish and eat it and not left half full. Hong Kong style cafe with a good variety of dishes. I like the noodles the best but their dinner specials are also nice."}
{"text":"Friday 7:30pm ordered garlic seafood fried rice off the dinner manu. Served hot tea as soon as I sat down, dinner comes with a big bowl of soup, much bigger bowl of soup than most restaurants; usual flavour. The dinner also comes with a drink, I asked for HK milk tea.  Food came relatively quick, the place was 80% full.   Garlic seafood fried rice was ok, small pieces of seafood, not much flavour. Texture of the rice was good, firm and not sticking together.  I added some sriracha sauce and soya sauce to the rice and made it much better for my salty taste.   Portion size is generous.   Will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"bring my family here before my daughter's weekly piano lesson.   Good food for a reasonable price. Braised eggplant is amazing."}
{"text":"Pad thai big portion..taste okay...but crushed peanuts not fresh..  Overfried and thin pork chop.   Just fast and big portion."}
{"text":"TAO Canteen is a Chinese restaurant serving typical \"cha chan tang\" food along with a select few Thai dishes. It's a relatively new restaurant and the only HK cafe in the nearby area. I've come a couple of times to try it out.   Decor:  In the \"main\" area, it has a more HK cafe feel to it. The wooden chairs and hardwood floor really seem to contribute to that feel. It also has a high ceiling in this area, maybe replicating a canteen? The tables are sort of a mix between modern and HK cafe which is quite nice. The seating here is comfortable enough and not cramped, except for the booth seats, which can be a bit cramped with two people per seat. The lighting here is good, more of on the bright side (to my liking). However, the visible table with the take out containers, and containers for utensils is a minus.   In the more inner area it has more of a modern feel to it. Grey paint along the walls and grey tiling along some of the walls makes it a lot more modern. Ceiling is lower here as well, a contrast from the \"main\" area. Here it is all booth seats which (as mentioned before) are a bit cramped though comfortable. The lighting is a bit dimmer which is to my dislike.   Score: 3.75  Service:  The service is pretty typical of a cha chan tang. Fast and competent. They get your order and the food to you. However, after only coming a couple times I already noticed that every now and then they are nice.   Score: 3.4  Food:  After trying out multiple dishes I've noticed that I generally like their rice dishes better. Noodle dishes are average in my opinion and are too MSG-y. The overall quality is average or above average depending on what you choose.   One good dish I've tried is the baked pork chop? (or chicken steak, I forgot) with tomato sauce & cheese on rice. There is a generous amount of meat and enough sauce for all the rice (your typical baked fried rice, not plain). They aren't skimpy on the cheese either. The meat is also tender and good. However I think that the cheese is overpowered and thus you can't really taste it. The tomato sauce is good but if they toned it down a bit so I could taste the cheese that'd be great. Portions are good for price and the quality it pretty good as well.   An okay dish I've had is their Hainanese Chicken rice. While it's nowhere near Phoenix's its still pretty decent and better than some other ones I've tried. The rice and chicken are pretty decent, though lacking the full flavour of Phoenix's. The chicken is a bit more lean than I would like though. They have pickled carrot and daikon with it which is a nice twist. What is weird though is that the chili sauce that comes with it has more of a ginger flavour than the actual ginger and green onion sauce. Weird. For portions the price is decent but its lacking in quality.  A meh dish I've had is their braised beef brisket with rice in red wine sauce. While the beef brisket was mostly tender which was good. It was the sauce the was really disappointing, despite the fact that this dish had a \"thumbs up\" beside it, the sauce was flavourless. Yup, I couldn't taste much. On the bright side though the portions were big so that was nice. The price for portions was good but not for quality.  Their drinks are above average. Their cold lemon iced tea is pretty good however, it is lacking sweetness in my opinion. The hot honey lemon water is decent, however sometimes it seems that there is barely any honey. And last time I checked, they charge $1.00 for it while other HK cafe only charged $0.75?   Score: 3.3  Total Score: 3.5 (rounded)"}
{"text":"My family visits here just because it's close, but the flavors are off. The noodles for example, is very soggy. It is just very convenient because there are not many Chinese restaurants in the northern part of Markham. I would rather not visit here if I have time to drive further away."}
{"text":"The food always comes in big portions and is tasty for a bit. It gets tiring really quick. I've tried many things on the menu and only particularly like the baked pork chop on fried rice with tomato sauce. The iced lemon tea is really big so you can split that with a partner. The service is OK. They don't seem to do well under stress, especially during dinner time hours."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Service is lightning fast and the breakfast was better than other restaurants."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place with my husband. The portions are huge (one dish is usually enough for two people) but take-out dishes are slightly smaller. There's normally no wait time for a table because the place is so big, and the food comes quickly.  This is the best HK cafe in the area."}
{"text":"This place was busy on a Saturday afternoon 1pm, ordered two baked Seafood on rice.  Quantity and quality were lacking.  Unfortunately we were running to the washroom a few hours later."}
{"text":"I think I may have ordered the wrong thing. Ordered malay laksa noodle soup but there didn't seem to be any coconut milk in it, which makes it hard to even classify as curry laksa. Other people's food looked good but I wouldn't know. If I go again I'll get beef brisket."}
{"text":"Food quality improved over a year ago.  MSG finally cut back a lot.  Overall not bad for something you don't have in mind for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents after some business in the area; won't be coming back.  Restaurant size: Plenty of room for small groups, with a mixture of tables and booth-like areas.  Food quality: Pretty sub-par for a HK-style cafe. Enough said.  Service: There was one staff who had a habit of throwing down and slamming plates into the bins while yelling. Pretty difficult to wave someone down, and even if you do they can forget about you...  Final thoughts: I'll fill up my canteen elsewhere, thanks."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just meh. They don't really have any dishes that stand out and I don't recommend ordering anything deep fried as it's not cooked thoroughly. Twice my fish filet was undercooked. The chef seems to have an attitude as well because when I got the fish back it was slapped back on the plate in a haphazard way and oil was all over the plate. Their iced lemon tea is good. They do charge for a takeout cup."}
{"text":"Tried their beef brisket. For Chinese restaurant, it is on the pricier side compared to scarborough. But their satay beef brisket hit the mark."}
{"text":"If you are tired and sick of eating out in a fancy restaurants this is a good place to come. Its plain and simple home cooked food. Food is decent ane simple just like home food mom always cook. Dont expect too much, only worst thing is consistency. I usually come and eat here cause its close to home or bored with other restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now because my mom moved up this area and we go here when I visit.  There is nothing else close by so if you want HK cafe food, this would be the place to go to if you're up here.  The food didn't WOW me, but just like any of these joints it's what you expect.  It's like going into McDonald's and ordering a Big Mac combo...you're not expecting that Big Mac to blow you away, but you know what you're going to get.  That's all I hope for when I walked into TAO.  All I expected was to get something that resemble and tasted what I ordered.  To that, they did a great job.  It was good value which is inline with all the other HK cafes.  The seating was very comfortable and the service was very good.  Most of their combos come with a hot drink (add some money for a cold drink).  Just hope they keep up with the consistency...no surprises and I'm happy!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick mediocre Chinese \"diner\" and happen to be in north east Markham? You can check this place out ... If you're out of options.  Food: typical Chinese diner style food. You have lots of the typical baked meat dishes or noodle broth soups. They also have some not so stereotypical items like Paad Thai.  Any good? Nothing special. It's hard to screw up a satay beef with instant noodle. But they get my attention with the breakfast specials i.e. free drink.  Basically this place's strength isn't its food but how quick they can turn food out. If you need mediocre food quick, come here.  Decor: Like the food, nothing to write home about. A few TV's for the seniors to watch Chinese soaps. Other than that, pretty stereotypical right down to the spelling errors in the menu.  Washroom: once again, a diner. Not gross, but not super clean either. Meets the basic requirements."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Speed was moderate but the food was rather bland.   I ordered the beef with tomato on rice and the baked pork chop spaghetti with tomato sauce and cheese. Both came with this tomato based sauce and it was really bland. The noodles lacked sauce and had a faint taste, and the rice was just drowned in sauce, almost like congee.   Overall the dishes need more salt and pepper, just something to spice it up and make it less bland."}
{"text":"Came here last week ~ the food tasted average not the best for its price and quality for a HK style cafe  ..money price matches with phoenix ..quality worse than your average HK afternoon tea style cafe  Well you can't go wrong with luncheon meat and vermicelli but the vermicelli tasted low quality and too soft.  This  costed around $6 and I also ordered lemongrass porkchop vermicelli that tasted below average and it was $7..... Pretty over priced for some cheap noodles ...  Sigh"}
{"text":"Very bad first impression. Seeing that they had very little customers we asked if we could sit at a larger table. If they explained nicely it would have been okay but the waitress was very rude and mean about it.   They also didn't refill our tea, and this is disappointing especially because there were very little customers. We had to ask before they did.   Food was okay. The fried squid was subpar because it was way too hard. The sweet and sour pork was pretty good though."}
{"text":"It's a typical HK style cafe. It's not the best but the not the worst. Service is always quick and polite. We never have to wait for a table because there is a lot of seating and space. I remember when this place used to be some kind of noodle restaurant years ago. I do believe they have a breakfast specials but I'm never awake for those.  My parents and I usually come here for dinners when we don't want to cook. There is a ton of parking in the plaza so we never have to worry.   The ladies here are always polite and attentive. Food is quick and hot. But i have tasted better and worse. I like how they refill the soup (appetizer) for you, although they do take away the meat and just give you extra broth.   The portions are decent size too, we always walk home with leftovers for the next day.  It is nothing special and a little pricier than most HK cafes but because of location and convenience my family and I return. Are there better ones out there? For sure. But if you are in the neighbour and want a quick bit than this place will do."}
{"text":"Environment 2/5  Typical HK-style cafe where it has uncomfortable chairs and tvs on the wall.  You cannot hear what the tvs are saying because of the loud volume of Chinese speaking loudly (similar to a dim sum restaurant).  I visited during lunch rush hour so it was very busy.  I came here by myself where I was seated in a table with another group of loud seniors speaking Mandarin.  It was very awkward and quite honestly the waitress should not have put me there as there was a booth table available.  Quality of Food 2/5  I ordered from their lunch \"special combo\" menu, wonton noodle soup with almond milk ($5.99 + $1 upgrade drink).  It looks traditional like other places but the wonton had no shrimp just frozen pork (about 4-5 medium sized) wonton dumpling pieces.  I took a few bites from one wonton and refused to eat the rest because it did not taste good.   The noodle and soup base were fine.  I quickly ate the noodles but didn't really consume the soup because I'm sure it was filled with msg.    Service 3/5  Normal-Asian style quality service.  They weren't rude but had the attitude of \"what else do you want?\" body language.  When I saw a table made available and there were no more crowds, I asked to be re-seated.  They agreed to my request where they aided me by moving the food to the table.  The plate and drink were slammed loudly onto the table.  Overall 3/5  Similar to all Chinese restaurants, when they first open they are energetic and the food quality is good.  I visited the place when it first opened because like a previous reviewer, there weren't (and still aren't) a lot of Chinese restaurants north of Hwy 7.  It was good in the beginning but since my last experience (and this will be my LAST) the whole place has gone south.  The environment was dirty where the tables felt greasy and had grimes (on both tables I were seated).    The price of the food was very affordable (aka cheap) but I guess you pay for the poor food quality.  The service was average so it's best to not come here with high expectation that you're going to be \"wow\" by the older waitresses (not pretty and no make up), if you're a guy with \"Asian fetish\" best to spend your money at First Markham Place or Commerce Gate.  Updated Note:  I ended up getting food poisoned which I can say is sourced from here (I only ate out once for the past 4 days which was here)."}
{"text":"Hk style cafe, lots of variety! It often gets really busy but you can get a table pretty quick. I tried the beef with tomato on rice and added an egg. Loved it, menu items are similar to other Hk cafes like blue ocean. Price is low and huge portions. You definitely get your money's worth! Will be back to try out there other items."}
{"text":"This review is just for the soup noodles and not for the other food items.    I came here before for a curry rice and I wasn't that impressed.  I came back here a second time because the Vietnamese restaurant we wanted to try decided to close early because of the ice showers.    Since my wife and I were craving soup noodles we both ordered a wonton soup noodle and beef ball ho fun.  I was pleasantly surprised because it wasn't bad.  My noodles had a firm texture and the soup had the right balance (not overly salty).    We came here close to closing time so we were the only ones there so I am not sure if that played a role in how they made our food.   But if you ever come here, do try the soup noodles.  The other food items was meh to me."}
{"text":"After dining-in a couple of times I've decided to takeout my favourite dish and bring it home with me after work. Maybe this is more of a Tip than a review , since I'm stuck on the Chef Special : Malay Laksa has been consistent in flavour , with varying degrees of spiciness , it is my go-to for comfort food , especially during these long winters. It may take me a long time to work my way thru the extensive menu , but I'll let you know if this place ever disappoints. So far best $ value I've found nearby , for that warm fuzzy feeling mm-yumm . Pay no mind to those harsh critics , thankfully I only read Yelp reviews after-the-fact , when a place is deserving of mine!"}
{"text":"In the northeast corner of Markham, the number of authentic Asian restaurants gets a bit slim. From the outside, TAO Canteen looks like all the other chain restaurants in a strip mall. But inside it diverges into a real Chinese restaurant, complete with photocopies menu, typos and all.   I ordered a Seafood Fried Rice for a quick lunch. The dish came out quickly.  The biggest risk is that the kitchen uses questionable seafood, but this had clearly indentifiable chunks of fresh seafood, cooked to a perfect tenderness. This was a fried rice that had a real home cooked character to it.   A long look through the menu convinced me that I need to come back. Soon!"}
{"text":"Finally opened over a month ago. They had the 10% for a month and took it away thereafter.   1st experience: very minimal selection, not alot of specials..the only good thing was the lunch special was till 5:30Pm  2nd experience: service was bad, ordered spaghetti and came out rice instead.. when I said, I wanted spaghetti, they kept on repeating \"is rice ok? \"...I insisted in spaghetti... don't force me to eat something I dont want to. I'm the customer... sheesh..  Overpriced for the food and service.  Overall, not a place I would want to come back in awhile unless I see some improving reviews...this business may not last that long..."}
{"text":"For my last 2-3 visits over the past few months I have noticed that the quality of their stuff has gone downhill -- drastically. I am not sure what exactly happened here but things have gone sour.  I can't seem find any reason to like any of my previous favourites. The menu hasn't changed but the food has. I have noticed a sharp decline in clientele as well even during the weekend rush. I used to have to wait in line for a table but now tables are readily available.  I wouldn't waste my time coming here unless you are absolutely desperate or you are in dire need of a cheap fix. The only positive thing that remains is the relatively low price and huge portions."}
{"text":"Seldom go to this area, and accidentally found this place after shopped at Home Depot.  It is spacious and clean.  It serves almost everything; noodle, rice, congee and even Thai food.  We had fried rice noodle with beef ($7ish) and chicken laksa ($6.49).   They were in big portion....... oh no........ it's more than big......... it's huge!!  It's the biggest bowl of laksa I have ever had, and it's the blandest as well.  They didn't put in any coconut milk at all and the soup didn't have that thickness.  Fried rice noodle was ok. Smelled good and the beef was tender, but the noodle was a bit mushy.    *Drinks are included and with complimentary soup* **Disclaimer - WARNING - portions are in huge quantity and  please come with an extreme empty stomach**"}
{"text":"Probably won't be coming back. The food was below average for a hk cafe style. Which is disappointing because it's the only one around this neighbourhood. For example, a common menu item is fried chicken wings and fries. Taste good at any hk cafe. At this restaurant, it was very bland."}
{"text":"This restaurant must be mindful of salt usage, because the Chicken with Tofu and Preserved Vegetable had minimum salt.  The Eggplant with Minced Pork was served with fish sauce in a separate bowl.  The Charcoal Coffee with Sirloin Beef was bold in flavour, including salt, though.  The cooking ranged from forgettable (Chicken with Tofu) to average (Eggplant with Minced Pork), to good (Charcoal Coffee with Beef). Actually, I cannot with sincerity recommend you to order the Chicken with Tofu dish.    Interesting!  They cook with used grounded coffee in all the so-called Charcoal Coffee with Chicken/Beef/Pork entree/rice/noodle, and the result was nice, even refreshing.  There is an obvious charcoal taste that adds a flavour but it does not overwhelm the other tastes going on in the entree.  Nice inhouse specialty.  I encourage you give it a try next time you are here.    We ordered a dinner combo for three ($26) that came with rice and starter soup.  Considering that 3 bowls of rice was worth $4.50, each entree costed $7.20 on average.  The entree was cheaper than those sold at T&T Supermarket.  At this canteen pricing, I am willing to visit for a cheap eat again."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best, my wife could not eat her lunch dish and I only ate about half of mine. Perhaps ordered wrong things."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with this place.  Ordered a wonton noodle soup. I thought the noodles were over cooked and a bit soggy. The wontons themselves were small when compared to other places. $5.50 for the regular size and with extra noodle its an extra $1.50  Deep fried French toast $3.95 was pretty good. Came with maple syrup but I usually like it better with honey or condensed milk.   Service was fast and sitting with strangers is a high possibility which we had to endure since there are 3 huge round tables but most people come in groups of 3 or 4's.   The HK style milk tea was like 80% milk and 20% tea. Didn't really like it.  A very forgettable experience but suitable for cheap quick meal."}
{"text":"UPDATE - Went this morning for a quick breakfast. Same fast service. Same parquet floor tiles on the walls. But was a bit disturbed to see a fly in the sugar container. More so when we also found a fly in our vinegar. Was going to let it go, but I see other Yelpers have posted similar photos. Taking off one star for flying against sanitary norms.   ORIGINAL REVIEW - Came for morning tea as Son goes to Chinese school. Typical HK style cafe. Cleaner then most. TVs everywhere, all playing the local Chinese channel. For some reason, every time I am at a HK style cafe, it's Dr. Ho selling his latest gadget to relieve back pain. I've been following him for two decades now and frankly what I want him to tell me is how he stays so young-looking.   We ordered beef satay instant noodle and preserved vegetables with rice noodle. Standard fare on a pretty slim breakfast menu. The food came within minutes and was flavoured well (not too salty, which is critical). Portions are decent, not generous). Prices on the full menu are generally between $5 to $10, and breakfast is no more than $5.75, which includes a drink.   Surprisingly, the drinks came almost immediately, which a not the norm. I'm looking at you, Firefly. And you, Phoenix.   The place is kid friendly. Parents with babies be warned. The change table is awkwardly close to the door, so you may get hit by incoming traffic. Also, it's in the women's washroom. So Dad FTW, unless you are a dad going solo. Incidentally, PSA to Chinese restaurant owners: washrooms are for washroom things. Step ladders don't belong. Mops don't belong. Canned drinks don't belong.   Someone decided that parquet floor tiles would look nice on the wall and on the ceilings. They kinda sorta do, until they start coming off the walls and ceiling. Which these ones have. So watch for falling tiles as you enjoy your (good) dining experience."}
{"text":"My stomach. Ugh, I don't think I'll need to eat for a week.  This restaurant is perfectly if you prefer quantity over quality, and I mean heavy quantity. I thought Sugar Sweet Cafe was known for quantity, but this tops it and then some.  The iced lemon tea in this place is gigantic. It's about the size of an extra large soft drink at a fast food restaurant, and that to me is simply too much to handle. However, the tea is of poor quality and honestly tasted like Nestea or the tea you get from fast food restaurants.  We ordered the laksa and the chicken pad thai. Both were obviously of good value due to the size portions (honestly I don't think two people can finish the pad thai in one go), and my dad actually liked the quality of the laksa. The pad thai was average, but I can't really complain considering it only costed $7.95.  Service was okay, but we were the only ones in the restaurant the whole time so I expected a bit more attention in terms of asking us how the food was and thanking us for arriving at 9pm, 1 hour before they close.  I would not come back if I'm on a half-full stomach. On an empty stomach I would consider a second try for some of their other items."}
{"text":"Food was so so.  Not great and not bad.  Very fast service....almost food court fast.  If you're in a pinch and need food (and live nearby) then I will recommend it.  Food was a tad on the greasy side, but was well seasoned (maybe a little too salty).  Food arrives on nice bowls and plates. Menu was a tad overwhelming....my wife had trouble deciding and got a little flustered at the amount of food choices.  Try it...you might like it."}
{"text":"I dont like the pad thai it doesnt taste good.. just go somewhere else.. it is not worth it.."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for a change..   Food was horrible...ordered fried noodles and deep fried squid...  Squid wasn't crispy enough and tasted so salty ...... noodle was just a bowl of egg noodles with soup on the side... total expense $22.50 for two dishes...this would have cost me just $15 at my regular Chinese...  would not recommend"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place. Baked pork chop in tomato sauce on rice came with lots of burnt bits on the pork chop. The food came out especially fast even though the restaurant was moderately busy. Cold milk tea was filled with mostly large ice cubes (to the top) and wasn't worth the extra $1.  I think it's worth it to go somewhere else (eg. McCowan / Bur Oak, or Kennedy / Bur Oak) if you're looking for your HK style fix.  I think I will go again to give it another shot, and because its location is convenient. You'll hear again from me soon hopefully!"}
{"text":"This is an average, run-of-the-mill HK-style cafe. Service is usually very quick, the food just so-so, but portions are huge. The menu is quite extensive, but I strongly recommend sticking to the more \"classic\" HK fare, like chow mein or fried rice. It's a good place to grab a quick bite, but not something I'd rave about. They also do takeout, but no delivery."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch with my friend. Best part about the place are the super low prices.  The menu is pretty straight forward. Lots of soups, lots of rice diahes. There are also lunch, tea time and dinner deals which are super cheap. When I was looking at the set meals for lunch, they averaged about $5.50.  We both got braised beef noodle soup. The broth was very tasty and had a good flavourful kick. The beef is incredibly tender and just falls apart. Unfortunately what is usually my favourite part, the noodles, were very over done. They had no bite to them and my teeth sunk right through. Even though they are udon noodles, they can be very good if not overcooked!   Anyways, its a great soup and I wont forget about that. Just fix the noodles and this place will be bangin"}
{"text":"Was in the area and a friend recommended this Western Chinese style restaurant for lunch.  I gave it 3 stars but my daughter says she would only give it  2 1/2 stars.   The portions were definitely huge, very good value for both the 2 set lunches that we ordered which were about $8.25 & $8.95 which included a hot drink or soya milk.  I quite enjoyed the baked pork chop rice with tomato & cheese although some pieces of the meat was a bit dry.  The creamy fish fillet spaghetti was bland and spaghetti was over cooked but the fish was nicely done.   I think the problem was the food was already prepared in advance since the dishes came out in 5 mins after we ordered.  Overall the services were good and will likely come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"There aren't too many Chinese HK-style cafes in this area, so decided to stop by here. It's a spacious location, convenient if you have children or strollers. Food is average, nothing special, but prices are decent/cheap if you want a typical Chinese cafe breakfast. The location isn't crazy noisy so it's quite relaxing.   Satay beef with noodle was okay. Not much satay flavour. Congee with shredded pork, egg, and dough fritters was average. You may need to add salt to improve the flavour. The standard egg/sausage/bacon/toast breakfast was average as well. Each breakfast option comes with a drink (coffee, HK milk tea, soy) or add $1 for alternatives. HK milk tea was rich and I enjoyed it. If I had to pay $4.50-$5.50 for McDonald's or this I'd probably go for this. I've had better in town though.   3 stars for food. 4 stars for value."}
{"text":"Another Hong Kong Style cafe that serves authentic chinese dishes. O.k service is not great here, very basic, but this place is always packed with regulars and locals. The food is o.k but lacks the wow factors and as other have mentioned they do use a lot of msg. In terms of value for your money its a good deal but I don't think I would come back here again. Decor is fine and the place is fairly clean. If the service improved and they used less msg, it could easily jump a star in by books..."}
{"text":"I've honestly read so many bad reviews that I was scared to come in here.  But since my sister was buying me lunch I couldn't say no (the struggles of a foodie) and now it will give me a chance to review.  This place is convenient with their own parking lot - none of the usual parking difficulties of going to a HK cafe.    Even with all the bad Yelp reviews - this place was PACKED. Granted it was filled with people who you would not assume to use Yelp (older generation families).  There was a line-up at the door around 1PM and people started sharing tables.  We got take-out: Red Wine Beef Brisket Rice - This was surprisingly, shockingly, devastating delicious. I have a tendency to become a little suspicious when Chinese restaurants use alcoholic beverages. But the sauce and the brisket went together very well & this is an item I would go back and take-out without hesitation. Chicken Gravy Rice - They got my order wrong the first time and gave me a new box.  The portions were huge - they gave me 2 pieces of chicken that took up half the take-out box and was drowning in gravy + a nice portion of rice to go alongside it.  My sister told me this place was a hit or miss - you might get sick/you might not...... But after an hour of eating I am feeling fine.  I will update if I develop weird symptoms."}
{"text":"I came here around 6pm on a Wednesday. It wasn't too busy, I got a seat right away. I ordered the pad thai because it was in the chefs special. It wasn't the best pad thai I've ever had but I should have known that coming in since this restaurant is not specifically a thai restaurant.  What I did like was the value. For 8.50 I got pad thai that was definately big enough for 2 people, a decent sized veggie soup, and a hot milk tea. The waitress was also nice and gave everyone a cup of hot tea as soon as they were seated.   Overall, decent food at a great price but I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Good: 1. Speed - Lightning fast service.  You will usually get your food within a few minutes of ordering. 2. Food from Chef's Recommendation - Seems like only the items in the Chef's Recommendation section is worth ordering.  I particularly love the lemongrass chicken with thick, juicy, and crispy pieces of chicken.  They definitely do this dish right.  Neutral: 1. Cash/debit only - Not a fan but I guess acceptable to keep costs low.  Bad: 1. All other food - Tried to order other normal stuff but they got my order wrong.  Still ate it but wasn't great.  All other times, the rest of the menu is meh.  Worth it? Yes, it's convenient, fast, and reasonably priced.  All food items come with drink as well so that helps make it worth it."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for TAO Noodles for months. And finally....  Lunch Special till 5:30 pm with over 20 + items to choose from.   My Wonton Noodle ($4.95) with a choice of drink is A-Ok. The wonton has a good balance of shrimp and pork with a touch of shrimp roe. Small in portion and great in taste. Reminds me a lot of what they serves in Hong Kong.  I will be back to try out other dishes as it is really convenient location for me and opens till 11 pm.  Seating is comfy and the restaurant is spacious will high ceiling.  A little hot and humid though today without enough AC...it definitely felt like Summer in Hong Kong!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place since we've been to the other restaurants nearby. I didn't like the brownish-orange plastic water glasses, but the dishes were fine and the restaurant seemed clean. The portions are definitely big, we ate half of a pad thai and a beef ho fun that night and the rest of it the next day. The tea was the strongest I have ever tasted, but maybe it is supposed to be that way? The prices are definitely reasonable, so although it wasn't great because it is close we may go and try it out again."}
{"text":"First off, I like my hk cafe.... By far I don't usually have high expectation on service or food. But the food and service was terrible...    They really need to change management ..."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times because it's in a convenient location for me, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. I ordered a BLT sandwich and there was so much mayo that it was oozing out (gross!) it's a good place to go to if you're just looking to for a filling meal. They serve large portions of rice/noodles with the dishes. I got a sandwich, a tofu with fish fillet and rice dish, a spaghetti with diced angus beef + veges in black pepper sauce and two milk teas. The tofu was very salty but it was alright with the plain rice. The beef was good and not tough at all. Milk tea was mediocre. Our total came to $30. I came at noon and got a spot right away but there was a line up not too long afterwards."}
{"text":"WOW. EW. MSG ALERT.  We visited here for an afternoon lunch (3pm), we were the only people. THEN came NEW people, WHY were they seated behind us out of everywhere in the restaurant!? That giant man just kept nudging my seat!  I had the satay beef vermicelli (soup noodles), a very common Cantonese fast food dish. But all I remember is the MSG after taste.   My brother enjoyed his chicken fried rice. He ordered a cold lemon ice tea, and it comes in giant pint-size cup! Biggest ice tea I've seen!  The service was adequate... Prices here are pretty good! Cheap, in my opinion. My satay bowl was only $4! I also didn't like the smell outside the restaurant. Not sure if it was because of their kitchen? It was reeallly bad.."}
