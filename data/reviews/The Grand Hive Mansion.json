{"text":"Went to Grand Hive last night for dinner with my boyfriend, not too bad and we may go back. I think it's an old house that's been converted to a restaurant/pub....and the decor and menu indicate that the powers that be can't decide if it should be a restaurant or a pub. Would be a good place to do some reading or work with a beer. It's nice but quite drafty.   We had crab cakes that were on top of a strange orange sauce and while they were on the salty side they weren't bad. I had a burger which was really great with a side salad unfortunately drenched in balsamic vinegar. My boyfriend got chicken fingers which were ok - pretty hard to ruin chicken fingers!   They don't have a great variety of beer on tap - only four and they were out of two. They only carry a limited selection of bottles but the wine list is good and on Tuesdays they have a promo where any bottle of wine is half price."}
{"text":"We had the fried calamari, the rib-eye and ribs. Everything was delicious and we liked the relaxed ambience. We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all with the Grand Hive. I actually went in with very low expectations and got exactly what I expected.  We got a table for 2 on the patio and there were only about 6 or 7 other people there. There could have been more inside, I didn't check.  The service was very good - attentive, friendly, quick, and helpful with suggestions. That was the only good part of the meal.  The main menu was a little pricey for a place I didn't trust, so we both ordered off the bar menu. I just went to the website to confirm what we ordered and it looks like they have a new menu....so take this review with a grain of salt, there's a chance they've improved (it looks like they've downgraded some of the prices, anyway).  We started with a tomato and bocconcini salad. The tomatoes didn't taste especially fresh and the balsamic was a little too sweet.  I had a rib and wing combo. The BBQ sauce was bland; the wings were okay but nothing special; the ribs were tough and chewy. The meal came with fries (undercooked) and vegetables (tasteless).  Without the menu I can't recall what my date had but she wasn't impressed with it.  I'm eager to read a review from someone who tries the new menu to see if anything has improved."}
{"text":"The Grand Hive has a great setting (especially in the summer on the patio), good quality food, and good service.  I don't find myself craving it, but it's a solid restaurant and almost never has a line.  If you're looking to dine in a mansion for less than you'd pay at The Keg Mansion (and without the line)."}
{"text":"Great food, great setting, and great waitresses. Sarah and Nico are amazingly charming and I will definitely come back due to their great service.  Patio is one of the best in the Village (Fuzion on Church also has a great patio), especially for summer dines/events. Interior dining is great for rainy or colder days, especially since it is set in a former manor home turned restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful patio!!! It's gorgeous.  Went here yesterday for brunch. It was great.  I had the The Hive Burger (they had a very limited pride menu, but all restaurants in the area are doing that) which was  awesome. The meat had a really great flavour and the put a flavoured mayo on the bun with was really good.  As well, their fries was awesome.   I'd definitely come back here again and try out their full menu."}
{"text":"So ive been to this place a few times, I went again today for lunch (just got back actually) This place is such a GEM. Its (kinda) across from The Keg Mansion, and its and old Mansion also. The inside is absolutely gorgeous!! Im sure that they have kept the original molding, its so rustic and intimate. So the inside has a few sections, i think one is a large party area where they have private gatherings (the doors close off to the open) and then there is the dining area (which is very very intimate) and the bar area. The patio is open in the summer which i enjoyed today! The food is really good and the portions are very fair. The price is considerably cheap. going to this place you think that you are paying more, but the prices are really good.   Today I had the cobb salad but no bacon,egg, and blue cheese. It was on mixed greens and instead of poppy seed dressing i got balsamic. My variation was very satisfying but im sure the original is really good too!! I cant remember what i had the time before, but i remember thinking \"im for sure coming back here\" Last time I sat in the dining area with my bf and it was nice and calm, and very romantic. I suggest going here for a nice quiet dinner in the evening or a wonderful lunch on the patio!"}
{"text":"My friend bought a voucher for the Grand Hive so we decided to have brunch here this afternoon (02.06.11).  In an old mansion, the dining area is divided into various unique rooms (think The Keg Mansion just across the street). We sat in the more 'modern' lounge area with lounge chairs and 4 flat screens around the room.  The brunch menu is a plenty here ranging from your traditional egg entrees to funky pancakes. Pricing of the meals are quite reasonable considering the big portions.  For $40, we were able to try a few dishes. I ordered the Corn Beef Hash w/ 3 eggs (any style) - when I order this dish at other joints, you can tell that the kitchen just open a can of corn beef hash from the grocery store down the street. It's homemade here and not bad ! Friend ordered the Egg Hollaindaise - we found the biscuit to be a little stale, but it was still passable. Finally as 'dessert' to our meal, we ordered the Dutch Oven Apple Pancake. It was delish !!  Our server was excellent ! She was extremely bubbly and came to our table often. All servers should be like her.  The Hive is open only for brunch and dinner; during the week they have a few deals including $5 Martini Thursdays. Consult their website for details on other nights.  Does parallel parking cause you mini-non-lethal heart attacks? Or does the constant fear of parking enforcement result in a long lasting migraine? No problem! There's free parking on site.  Yay, I'm a fan. Yay, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I went to Grand Hive tonite with my girlfriend as we had an online  WagJag half-price deal... and even at half-price this place wasn't worth it.  Sure the atmosphere is nice, and the staff was friendly.. but the food was awful!  First of we were sat at a table with bucket chairs and the table was too high for the chairs, it kinda felt like we were eating at the kids table at family dinner.  They bring a complimentary basket of large potato chips to start the meal, they're tasty... although when they caught the light and i saw the grease glisten off them i stopped eating them.  I decided to start the meal by ordering something that was trying to be passed off as a \"tortilla soup\", which was more like unseasoned grilled chicken thrown into a watery broth and some tortillas tossed in.. this soup was so bad i didn't finish it.  Then i made the mistake of ordering the quesadilla with chicken... once again,  no flavor in this at all.  I ended up asking for a side of wing hot sauce to make thing this taste better.  My girlfriend ordered the pear and walnut bruschetta, it was different but overall pretty average.  She then had the arugula salad, which although a plentiful portion has a an oil and vinegar dressing on it... but we think they forgot to add the vinegar.  ... and to top things off I ended up getting a parking ticket when parking on the road directly beside the restaurant, so be careful of that.  If you're considering going to the Grand Hive because you're in teh area, do yourself a favour and walk across the street to The Keg Mansion, you'll have a MUCH better meal."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible! Very inattentive wait staff. The first time I went here I got up and left because we were left sitting on the patio not greeted and drinkless for 30 minutes. I went here for a friend's birthday because Keg Mansion was full, and he ordered the surf and turf. I asked him how his meal was and he said he had \"2 good bites\". Ha! I ordered the pasta which I tasted about as good as something I could make at home out of a jar. To be far the pizzas could be good and the lobster bake macaroni could also be good....but I doubt it! I gave it 2 stars only because I have a thing for old mansions.  Don't bother!"}
