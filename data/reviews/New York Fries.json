{"text":"I love NYF and this location was perfect. I ordered a hot dog and the works fries. The hot dog was big and the buns were fresh as well as the toppings available. The works fries were awesome and the price was good for all the food u get with the combo."}
{"text":"I was looking for a poutine while I was shopping at eaton center. I found that place called NYF Poutinerie, so I decided to give it a try. The decision was a mistake, Iam from Montreal and so truly know what a poutine looks like and this was far from being one. For the regular poutine I had pretty small size,  they then put a smal amount of cheese wich was not the original one ( fromage en grain) it was just cottage cheese... Abeurk... Then they add an enormous amount of dark and thick sauce wich is closer to united-states culture than Quebec's culture. Oh and the sauce had a weird chocolate taste... Really the worst poutine I ever had. Cant believe they have a logo sayin : Poutine perfected since 1989, it is a shame."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time (and money) in here, a friend recommended me for the poutine since I m new in TO I trusted her and went there for lunch, I have never tried poutine before so I couldn't judge until it gets in my mouth but and there I was wondering what it s supposed to taste :((( I couldn't feel anything even the cheese had no taste. Fries are good though.  For one drink, a small poutine and hot dog it came for 12$ ! 4$ for hot dog (sausage was cold) so I am still looking for a good poutine...."}
{"text":"The food was alright, but the service was not. I paid for 10 dollars worth of food with a 50 dollar bill, and I only got 30 dollars back. The cashier acted very irritated when I said the money was wrong, and was so convinced that she did the math right that she refused to listen to me (interrupted me constantly when I tried to tell her that 50-10 is in fact 40) until the manager came in. Not a great experience, and would not come back again."}
{"text":"These are the best fries in the business. The fast food business, I mean, and by fries I mean the freshest and tastiest fries with potato skin still on them. Dose the suckers in tons of salt and ketchup and it's almost like those old fry trucks that used to line streets in old stories.... Ah, yes. Good fries. They're not particularly cheap, but they are worth it. They fry them right in front of you after ordering them, so you know they're fresh and hot. The only drawback to New York Fries is their hotdogs. They're still not as good as Orange Julius, but the fries more than make up for it. They even have a lot of different toppings including spices to shake on them. I think they're just fine by themselves, but the option is there for those who like to get crazy....."}
{"text":"The amount of fries they gave was ridiculously low. i dont  understand the bizplan, neveragain."}
{"text":"Bought the hot dog and pulled pork poutine, the hot dog was dry and the bun was stale, the poutine was disgusting, didnt taste like pulled pork at all. Wouldnt eat here again."}
{"text":"Great staff! Very fast and they always give me a coupon! I love their butter chicken as they always put a lot of sauce on it!"}
{"text":"Poutine, solid mall snack.  Food: 4/5 Meh, it's New York Fries Service: 4/5 Fast and efficient Environment: 3/5 Meh Washrooms: N/A Food court Worth it?: 4/5 Great to share  I like coming here for a mid shopping snack. Super simple.   I really want a soft pretzel at the mall but don't get me started about that. Lol. Is it really a mall with out a soft pretzel shop?  Anyways. The line goes quick so I like it as a snack!"}
{"text":"I'd be lying if I told you that I don't feel guilty every time I eat these delicious creatures, but I really can't help it.   There's something about fries that have potato peel on them, and there's something about having them fresh from the fryer. Plus the seasoned salt that New York Fries serves, along with the ketchup that is cooled perfectly, makes them a worthy contender for the ultimate 'last supper'.   I love New York Fries. I always have, I always will. They are cheaply priced but they are high-quality made. They are the best fries in the business and the portions they serve (ie. the LARGE) are the perfect amount to satisfy me to the core.   NY fries make me happy and they'll never stop."}
{"text":"Tiny poutine place inside Eaton Center (Urban Eatery), a good choice if you wanna grab a quick poutine, I tasted the classical one with cheese and gravy, I liked it...   Yet I also want to highlight that this was my first poutine in Canada, so I would really need to compare that poutine with other ones to give a more accurate opinion :)"}
{"text":"A solid place for a slightly greasy, hot, salty snack. When I go here, it's not for poutine, but just for the solid (alright, somewhat flaccid) plain fries. They're delicious, and you really can't do better in a fast food place."}
{"text":"OK, so I\"m from the suburbs of NY--I've had NYC hot dogs.  These were not NYC hot dogs--they were good and didn't give you heartburn--serviously, the dogs were delicious and the fires while a little soggy for our teste were good!  A nice, inexpensive fast meal."}
{"text":"The staff working here are not customer-friendly. It doesn't matter if it's White or Asian, everytime i come here, they act so rude. They are not smiling, they take your order even if you're still far (that means they raise their voice and couldn't wait for you to move up. The food taste good but the customer service is worst! I'd rather go to Big Smoke Burger."}
{"text":"NYF is located at the food court in Scarborough Town Centre.  Their menu is quite simple. They sell fries and hot dogs. Fries include: Classic Style, Poutine, Pulled Pork, Braised Beef, Butter Chicken, The Works and Veggie Works. We had our eye on the Poutine. It was made it order, score! Total came to about $5.64 with tax for a small.  The fries were hot, crisp and soft within. Topped with soft cheese curds that were ooey gooey and brown gravy. Simply delicious. Nothing was overly salty and was seasoned well. Employees were friendly and quick.  Next time, I'm going straight for the Butter Chicken Fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"Not every NYF is made the same...as I learned grabbing a quick poutine today. I didn't have enough time in my lunch hour to get to Craft Burger and back or I would've satisfied my poutine crave there. I thought a quick substitute would be fine but the poutine was not good. My stomach will attack me later for the choice I made.   Also, staff were talking through my whole transaction. The cashier put my receipt on the counter in front of me and walked off. Erm, hello? You could've just handed it to me!"}
{"text":"The great Canadian tradition: hot, cheesy poutine. For a fast food chain, New York Fries does make a good one.   Fries are cooked to order with choice of regular, butter chicken or veggie works. Unlike McDonald's, they won't be drizzling massive loads of disgusting salt after they come out of the fryer. Butter chicken and veggie works flavours for me stand out, little twist to the traditional poutine. Must try!"}
{"text":"?????????1????????????????????????????????????????????????  6?????????????????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????????  ??????????????"}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, I had no idea that we were known for our fries.  New York Pretzels?  Bagels?  Pastrami?  I could see all that.  Yet in Canada the bagels are \"Great Canadian\" and the fries are \"New York.\"  I'll tell you what, though, you can't buy poutine in New York.   Well, maybe you can but you'd have to look hard for it.  Anyways, this location is in the Eaton Center food court.  The staff is okay... could be faster and the storefront could look cleaner, but the whole food court in the Eaton Center looks kinda dingy so it doesn't stand out.  The fries are pricy... since they are just fries.  But they're tasty.  Not too thick, not too thin.  Decently crispy.  You can get them in poutine or covered in sour cream or chili.  I just go regular and dunk them in ketchup.  No malt vinegar for this American."}
{"text":"I've had a thing for their \"the works\" fries for a number of years. It's an occasional treat, cuz deep friend and price for said deep fried food and all, but they do it quite well. Topped with chili, cheese sauce, sour cream, green onions and bacon bits. Yum yum."}
{"text":"Most people probably do not know this; New York Fries in spite of its name they are proudly Canadian!   The potato fries are so good you can eat them all by them selves, I of course prefer them with a little ketchup! But my favorite item on their menu is the poutine combo with a drink. Like a typical Canadian I love poutine! There are a few places that can do it right, and for a fast food chain I have to say that this place does poutine very well. This is a simply meal, however, if you don't use the right ingredients in the right combination it is also very easy to get it wrong. As this meal is available almost everywhere, we all have our favorite spots. for me New York Fries really nails the taste, texture, and combination of this dish.   If you have not tried the poutine here, I really recommend you try it. As I have said this dish is available almost everywhere and we all have our favorite spots, however this place really has a good poutine. I recommend it."}
{"text":"The best place that I would suggest or prefer to go and have butter chicken poutine. This was the first place that I tried this item, since then i am a fan of it and later I tried at different new york fries the same item but nothing could impress me as much as this place did.   It has the taste of Indian butter chicken which makes me like it more.May be I am biased .. hehe .."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed in New York fries square one shopping mall food court location. It was doing well for a while until just recently when I passed by bought large fries. The staff has changed so has the serving portion, they used to fill the cup of fries to the rim. Sometimes overflowing which was great! Not anymore, the cuts of fries are way too small, bite sized. They've cut down the portions which isn't worth it. Better off buying fries elsewhere like Harvey's, seems to be getting much worse, no hope for square one food court location. Other new york fries locations are much better especially with the serving portions. I will never return back as a customer they definitely don't deserve my money! I highly don't recommend this location just a big let down!"}
{"text":"Now, I'm a french fry lover. I'm a poutine lover. But I have yet to have a delightful experience at a NY Fries. The fries, to their credit, are not that bad. But for a place that specializes in fries (and poutine) they leave a bit wanting.  I mean, nothing gross about the place, the staff were fine, blahblah. Just my personal opinion that when you are making poutine (or fries for that matter) in a city like Toronto with all the amazing poutine joints you'd want to make sure that pout was making people lose their minds at the mere thought of it! Like go so crazy they become best friend's with the staff just for the chance of a free poutine at closing....or even a spare succulent curd.   No, not at NY Fries, I will not hold my breath for the spare curd."}
{"text":"This is one of my guilty pleasures. Yes its a place I have to stroll past because I love it taste really good. I almost always order the fries supreme while my friend likes the poutine (which is good).  Even the fries alone are great. I have a weakness for fries and if you like fries you must try this place. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is about, I swear Costco poutine beats their poutine. The fries themselves are burnt and have a weird taste to them. Their hotdogs are bland AF. What a waste."}
{"text":"My go-to is always the veggie works. Makes me feel better about eating fries. The tomatoes, sour cream, and melted cheese are a perfect match with their fries."}
{"text":"When you order poutine you expect cheese curds and not some soupy cheese like sauce. There should be a law that says you can't call the garbage you serve poutine unless it has cheese curds."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for a good potato, give me any type of incarnation of it and I will definitely devour it.  Whether it is a baked potato, spuds or potato skins. I will be there with a bib on to try it.  Read some nice reviews about NYF so I thought I would give it a go.    NYC has excellent fries, straight from real potatoes with real potato skins still on.  Not greasy, nice and crispy on the outside, tender in the inside.  A nice portion for the price and friendly staff."}
{"text":"this was our second poutine ever, and after having poutine from harvey's the day before, i was left slightly disappointed. if they had new york fries in california, i would eat it in a heartbeat, but compared to the ones from a chain, i prefer harvey's poutine. with that said, both gravies used were vegetarian and i am sooooo sooo glad. if you can make it to another place for poutine, i would try them first. otherwise, i'd say go for it...it's not the worst, but it's also not the best....based on my experience of two servings of poutine. :P"}
{"text":"You know when you think \"oh that's a good idea\" and it really isn't? That was me eating New York Fries yesterday.  Oh get some poutine! It will be yummy! Yes it's junk food, yes it's fast food but it will be worth it! It isn't worth it.  I don't know what I was expecting. I have had some top notch fries in the past and I guess I forgot that New York Fries was a food court kinda food. The whole thing was just disappointing. The staff seemed nice enough but the fries themselves were not worth my $4.75.... and that is saying something.  Blarg.  I think I'll write up some good poutine spots soon. Keep an eye out for em."}
{"text":"For a place that focuses on only one product, I'd expect that product to be a little better. The fries were pretty mediocre. The different topping combinations were pretty good-- can't go wrong with the gravy on the poutine though the curds weren't terribly fresh, and the Works with the cheese and bacon was pretty nice. Nonetheless, a good batch of fries shouldn't need gravy or otherwise to make it delicious. Plus, the people that worked there didn't seem very interested. There are plenty of better options in this food court."}
{"text":"I have been here almost all the times I visit Square One. They are one of the best poutines I have had ! The crunchiness of the fries, the flavor, the heat were the perfect combination."}
{"text":"I haven't tried any Fries here in New York City that taste as good as New York Fries in Toronto. Some come quite close yet still missing that key element & ingredient. I shall one day return just for your Fries !"}
{"text":"Living in NYC, I actually had no idea there was such an establishment called \"New York Fries\" until a location opened in Hong Kong and a friend there took some pictures of it, and I saw the pictures on her facebook.  Those fries looked tasty in my friend's pictures and so of course I immediately went to its website to find a location in NYC.  Imagine my disappointment when I found that not only does it not have a location in NYC, it doesn't have a location in the States, period.  So this is the irony of a business called \"New York Fries\".  It has locations in Canada, the UAE, Korea, Bahrain, and Hong Kong, but no location in the US.  Well finally this past weekend while I was visiting Toronto, I was able to sample these fries.  I was recommended to try the poutine, as that is their \"classic dish\", so to speak, as far as a fast food place is concerned.  It was pretty delicious, and maybe I had built up my expectations too high, but it wasn't the mind-blowing taste-bud exploding experience I had wanted it to be.  Deep fried and covered with gravy and cheese curds, you definitely don't want to pretend you're Morgan Spurlock and eat it everyday as a 30-day challenge.  However, I would love to go back to try the other kinds of fries they have on their menus."}
{"text":"i'm back for a short trip and i had a hankering for poutine. i saw the new york fries so i had to get it. First thing that popped out to me, they had these new options! Angus beef poutine, butter chicken poutine and something else. Anyway, $5.75 for these specialty choices. the butter chicken was pretty good. it had the flavour that i thought it would. Anyway, i'd say that the regular is still the best, but it's probably worth trying the specialty choices just once."}
{"text":"I have come here a couple of times over the years and  I always find myself ordering the beef poutine. The fries are fresh and crunch, and the meat is  well cooked. I only wish they would go easy on the cheese and gravy as  I have to request a half portion of those two items so that  the  pouting isnt cheesy or soggy.  My other favourite poutine is the Works poutine minus the cheese  sauce and half the gravy and cheese in it . Its filled with flavour and a must try"}
{"text":"Very clean place. Service is fast and efficient. Staff is very friendly. It's a good stop-over snack shop where it's quiet and calm inside. It is also conducive for studying or reading. The bar stool area has a good view of the city life."}
{"text":"Service was great, really nice customer service experience. The sauce was a bit fake in taste as well as the cheese curds. They weren't stretchy, mostlikely were frozen. The price was reasonable."}
{"text":"I am locovore normally, but I have a soft spot for a few highly specific chain junk-food scenarios. New York Fries poutine with a rootbeer whilst sitting in a mall food court is high atop this *list. For my money, you haven't lived in the western world until you've found a table for one at a mall in Canada and scarfed this poutine.   The poutine itself has squeaky curds, crispy skin-covered fries and dark medium-warm gravy. It's pretty bad according to most, but I love it.  PEPPER'S PISSED at Matt M. One star? Let's go to the mall and buy some jean jackets and eat some poutine. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY_bhVSGKEg&feature=kp  *The other two are: +Eating a McDonald's McMuffin or Big Mac in a car to signify the beginning of a trip. +Swiss Chalet delivery straight to my couch, and eating off of their tiny plastic utensils while watching sitcoms. Hashtag extra sauce."}
{"text":"Got the pulled pork poutine. It was fresh and the portion size was decent. The fries were fried just right. The pulled pork was surprisingly well made and flavourful. Definitely not an item to take away, should eat fresh because the pulled pork had a lot of juice and will make the fries at the bottom become soggy. The staff was friendly and pretty quick with filling orders.  Overall, will definitely come back to grab some more fries."}
{"text":"My first meal and first poutine in TO/Canada and I wasn't satisfied. Perhaps I didn't order the right thing but although the braised beef poutine was tasty, the beef could be softer and fries more crispy."}
