{"text":"Definatly will eat here again, dined in, the place was nice and clean, staff were very friendly and super accommodating. As for the food, it was delicious, egg drop soup was tasty, fried rice was on point and the orange chicken was yummy."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot for Chinese. So far I have tried the orange chicken, bbq pork, fried rice, and egg foo young. They were all great, and the beef egg foo young is the best I've ever had. They are lightening fast. I even stopped calling in my order, because it was always waiting for me and I work like 1 mile away! They are extremely friendly and the service is great. I have been to a place that had this level of service and food at these prices."}
{"text":"Our service was quick. The servers were respectful and double checked our order. Nothing really stood out about this restaurant. It's pretty much your typical Asian food, although they do offer a wider variety for selection."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and it delicious!  Everyone there is really friendly! I recommend the crab puffs and orange chicken! They are AMAZING"}
{"text":"The food was decent but I was not wowed by any means.  The ingredients were fresh and portions were large so you won't leave hungry.  The dinning room is small and it can get a bit tight for the dinner rush.  The service was excellent and they allow substitutes for finicky eaters.  Oh the \"crab puffs\" could probably stand a trace of actual crab in them.  The décor is lackluster but not a bad place to visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere and great service close to the area I live in so delivery is always a good option. The food was good not great the shrimp fried rice had real medium sized shrimp  and nice fresh sliced chicken breast in the chicken lo mien. All in all I would recommend it if you're in the area.  Note. Prices are a little high"}
{"text":"I am eating their yummy offerings right now: eggrolls, shrimp lo mein, rice (a little undercooked), orange chicken, fried shrimp and kung pao beef. Delicious! The delivery was spot on and the man was super polite and professional. This restaurant and their efficiency left a good taste in my mouth!"}
{"text":"We had ordered for delivery. They said 40 minutes and they had to have gotten here in less than 20. Super fast and friendly. Food is fresh and flavorful. My only critique is the lo main noodles are gummy but the flavor and freshness of the taste makes up for it. Recommend the crab puffs and the orange chicken. Large portions. We are very pleased."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant! It was my first tjme trying this place and it was totally worth it. I would completely recommend this to anyone. Price was fair and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Placed an order to g for their sushi ..DO NOT RISK THAT!! This is plain garbage!!! It must have been from yesterday. They even have the nerve to charge extra for their different types of rolls.. avocado roll .. there night have been I hint of green. And the tempura shrimp.. NOTHING but a tail sticking out.  The sauce ontop of the rolls was so dried up that it hard. I WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM HERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"I've finally found a great Chinese place like back in the Midwest very authentic. 10 Stars. Sweet and Sour Chicken and the Mongolian Beef highly recommended."}
{"text":"I hate Chinese food but I LOVE this place. Its always clean even the restrooms... the crab puffs.. Orange chicken .. general wings.. amazing!!!"}
{"text":"People are always nice and food is good.  I've tried the orange chicken, Mongolian chicken, beef fried rice, beef on stick, and egg drop soup so far."}
{"text":"This review is for their chow mein.  I'm new to the area, decided to try this place as my friend was raving about it. It was Sunday 8PM, and for some reason could not get through to their phone line -- it kept getting forwarded to the owner's cell phone. No big deal, I understand the mainline can get busy, and the guy told me t keep trying a few minutes later.  It took about 20mins to get through. Mind you, I was starving, and wanted to order for delivery. So by this time, I was a bit discouraged to continue ordering bcuz at this rate, it's sooo late to eat.   But I was determined! By the time I got through, I had ordered the chicken lettuce wrap, general tso's chicken, Mongolian beef, beef fried rice. I really wanted some chow mein, but didn't see it on their menu since they only had chow fun, lo mein and pan fried noodles. But heck, the guy said they had chow mein, so I lucked out on ordering it from off the menu.  Got the food delivered quick. Tab was about $40, and was happy to tip the driver.  Food was good, for the most part. Lettuce wraps were on-point. The chicken and beef main dishes were good.   Again, this review is for their \"chow mein.\"  I found it appalling that they would use spaghetti noodles in their chow mein. SPAGHETTI!!!   I could not believe it! I've had my fair share of Chinese food. I'm coming from San Francisco Bay Area -- it is heavily Asian populated. Plus, I'm Asian myself. But c'mon guys! Spaghetti noodles?! Asian noodles are supposed to come in the form of rice, cornstarch or egg noodles. NOT PASTA!   Ideally, I don't like writing negative reviews. But just like to forewarn the other folks out there. For an $8 dish, put it on one of their other dishes instead."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food and I am well aware that Panda Express is not authentic.  But this place was a major let down.  I was really disappointed that this place was chosen to cater a banquet.  The food was cold, the chicken was hard, the noodles were soggy and the inside of the egg roll was over cooked.  I will not refer this place to anyone.  It makes me wonder if the person who chose this place has ever treated their pallet to real Chinese food."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the 1st time cause its close to us And it had good reviews. We did a take out order. Beef lo mein, general tsao chicken, sweet & sour chicken, pork fried rice & crab puffs. Everything was really good! Was pleasantly surprised! Will def b back.."}
{"text":"Got lazy and felt like getting delivery so I ordered from here and it was ok. Not very good but not very bad either. Delivery was quick but food was just ok."}
{"text":"The place was really cleans and welcoming. The lady gave us really Bad customer service. The hot and sour soup was good, The rest of the food had no seasoning."}
{"text":"This place always serves food promptly, hot and fresh (and delicious!), and the delivery is quick and oh so convenient! The restaurant itself is clean and a very pleasant atmosphere for a quiet lunch or dinner. The staff is friendly and helpful, and I have always had a positive experience."}
{"text":"This is my absolute go to for Chinese food. Love that they have egg fo young. Very quick as i usually call when I am in parking lot."}
{"text":"It's hard to find Good Chinese. Then factor in Az, then factor in I just moved to Tolleson. I thought I would be sentenced to cook everyday for the remainder of my days here. I rely heavily on reviews and then I debate. Well low and behold this place is great! I ordered pork fried rice and added shrimp, sesame chicken, and orange chicken. Omg so good! Plus, really nice workers. I was shocked. Two empressive things happened while I waited for my order. First, there was a sassy (atitudey) customer and this server did not flinch. She smiled and took care of the peach. I was so expressed. Second, the delivery guy hustled like he was on fire to get the order out. I mean he literally ran to his car. I was like, \"dam that's how get it out to the customer\". I usually don't write good reviews because in my experience customer service is rare if not dead.  This place made me so happy I had to let you know. Go get you some!"}
{"text":"One thing that stands out is the excellent customer service here! The staff is always very friendly and welcoming and the owner goes out of his way for customers. The food is also great. My favorite is their Arizona rolls!"}
{"text":"I just ordered from this place. I love egg drop soup and have ordered it from many places before. His by far is the best!  Just found my new fav chinese place !!"}
{"text":"If you want Chinese delivery...nothing beats this place on the west side. Fast, friendly, and always hits the spot."}
{"text":"I love this place too much! I use grub hub to deliver . The food is always fresh. The house lo mein  is wonderful. The crab puffs and egg drop soup are delicious. Sometimes they give me a little extra treat. Thank-you."}
{"text":"They serve the best egg drop soup I have ever had, and I have egg drop soup countless times at more Asian restaurants than I could count.   The base is traditional But they add ground chicken some of which is suspended in a delicious broth and some form delightful small dumplings that float amid carrot and peas.  Our office manager was raving about it so I had to check it out.   And what a surprise to the pallet!     I enjoyed their spring rolls as well.   Their luncheon menu offers a wide variety of chicken, shrimp pork and beef specials between five and six dollars.  All are tastey.  Another co-worker loves the orange chicken.  I like the moo goo gai pan.    The service is very friendly and fast which is good thing  when your time is liimited on an office lunch hour.   I look forward to visiting after work for a leisurely dinner to enjoy both their tastey entrees and conversation.  Go there and be sure to order the egg drop soup.   You will become a regular like I have.   See you there!"}
{"text":"Ordered the orange chicken, teriyaki chicken and beef like mein.  It was horrible!!  Orange chicken was over cooked and hard. Teriyaki was bland and you could tell the chicken was cooked without seasoning.  Beef was tough.   The only good thing was the crab puffs.   Save your taste buds and your money (expensive!). Go down the street to Blossom. Way better."}
{"text":"Love this place. Close to home and great service. They even deliver. The only Competition is dragon palace in P V"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best. I came in one day and ordered the lo mein and they use spaghetti pasta to pass as lo mein noodles."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service definitely regret not trying it any sooner!!! Highly recommend it !"}
{"text":"Ordered at around five today, through the online order option through their website. Did two apps, crab rangoons and potstickers, and an order of pork lo mein as well as some orange chicken. First impression - this place is crazy fast. Less than twenty minutes after placing my order I get a knock on the door. Food was really hot! Orange chicken was delicious with just a little bit of spice, and the pork lo mein was amazing. The rangoons were delicious, only downside was the potsticker wonton was a little chewy, but the filling was tasty. Came with standard sweet and sour sauce for the rangoons, and a spicy brown sauce for the potstickers. Overall a great meal with tons of leftovers. Will definitely order from here again!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy the food. The House Fried Rice is a must try. Great lunch and Dinner specials too."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great food. Fast delivery and affordable. The delivery guy is always so friendly. We normally get cheese puffs and egg rolls. I love honey walnut shrimp, orange beef and lemon chicken. My husband's favorites are sweet and sour chicken and vegetable egg foo yong. We probably have them deliver to us at least once a week! Great place and will never disappoint you"}
{"text":"Best chinese food in arizona! Love this restaurant! Walnut shrimp, sesame chicken and orange chicken are my faves!"}
{"text":"Always fresh tasting, fast and delicious!! Service is also wonderful had the Kung pao chicken today and it was great. I always get good quality and consistency. Their portions never disappoint. Lunch combos offer plenty of food to keep you full."}
{"text":"Love this place they have very good food I always get the double pan fry noodles all beef andshrimp fried rice house fun beef and shrimp and the wonton soup yum"}
{"text":"Have ordered delivery a few times from this place. Delivery is fast and the food is always hot. The dishes I have tried are: orange chicken, lemon chicken, house rice, and sweet/sour chicken. All tasted amazing and the ingredients are of good quality."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Is better to go pick up tho because they are always so busy! But that's how good they are.  If you wait is usually 1 hour delivery wait but if you go pick up is ready within minutes! I love all their food! Is pricey in my opinion but well worth it.   Specially if you have a group of people."}
{"text":"Didn't expect it, But it was fabulous. Loved every bite. Arrived before 3:00 on a Friday and ordered there lunch special. Very affordable. It came with soup, egg roll, fried rice and  steaming hot chunks of white meat perfectly breaded chicken, smothered in a sweet and sour sauce with just the right amount of bell pepper, onion and carrots. I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Reasonable priced Chinese take out, not stingy with the quantity of food. Loved the shrimp fried rice."}
{"text":"I am very picky about Chinese food and let me tell ya...This place had me at hello!! Very nice people when we eat there and a very clean restaurant.  Love ordering by the \"eat24\" app, when we need delivery too. Super convenient! My favorite dishes are  Chicken Lo Mein( gotta try it \"hot/spicy\".. Ohhhhhh myyyyy!), shrimp fried rice( plenty of huge shrimp btw!), sweet & sour pork with egg drop soup for starters, but, all the food is good to excellent! GET IN MY BELLY!!!"}
{"text":"Back again and loved it even more! Instead of hubby picking up whole fam swung by after church. They were a little busy and took a little bit longer longer than yelp said but staff checked in and updated on progress- offered water, really nice since I could definitely see they were busy.  They even went over the order before I left to make sure I had everything and sauces!! Love love love this place"}
{"text":"for my fellow truckers that are sick of all the fast foods shoved in front of us at all the big truckstops. We got the pork lo main and Mongolian lo main. awesome and it was delivery!"}
{"text":"What can I say they are one of the best. I love going there they always remember me. Their food is so delicious and they are so attentive."}
{"text":"Great food and delivers. Friendly employees, decent price food, fast on time delivery. I also must add the food was very good ."}
{"text":"*AMAZING* Chinese cuisine! Fast delivery, easy and equally fast take out and friendly service.  I grew up with some amazing Chinese food in the San Francisco bay so I was ecstatic when I found New Asian Star after moving to Phoenix. A+"}
{"text":"New Asian Star is an all-around great restaurant. If you're lucky enough to live within their delivery boundaries, you can expect quick delivery with a smile and a very gracious \"thank you\". I have dined in once and the area was very clean. The food is terrific! I have tried several things on the menu and I haven't been disappointed yet. Their crab puffs, sesame chicken, and hot and sour soup are some of my favorites. Everyone there is extremely nice, courteous, and grateful for your business and I am more than happy to patronize and support such a nice mom and pop establishment."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place in Arizona!! The double pan fried noodles are amazing!!!  Great food and service."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience, would like to give a 3.5. Got two combo dinners, the sesame chicken for me and the curry shrimp (no shrimp, add chicken). Within a minute of the waitress taking our order we got our soup which was good. Maybe 2 or 3 minutes after that got our meals, which we don't know how to feel about that. The sesame chicken was surprisingly delicious and most pieces were chunks of chicken, not just fried pieces. The three star for my boyfriends meal. Not only did it not look appetizing, but maybe a 1/4th of the plate was chicken. The rest seemed to be an entire onion, and some watercashews and carrots. He was pretty disappointed, so ended up helping me with mine. Big portion sizes!"}
{"text":"Cheap prices, decent food, friendly staff. I had the General Tsao's, added a side of veggies and an iced tea - came out to $8.30. My friend had the Kung Poa Chicken with water and he was out the door for $5.40 (less tip).   I gave this place 5 stars for the friendly staff, great price, and decent food."}
{"text":"Shrimp curry and orange chicken is the best. Love this place ! Close to home and always very attentive and kind staff!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and both times the food is better than exceptional. They have amazing costumer service, extremely diligent in their quest to keep a happy customer and always polite and cheerful. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for amazing Asian food and great service"}
{"text":"For an ultra affordable Chinese restaurant this place is amazing. The food is really high quality for how fast it comes out. We've eaten in and taken out and both experiences were great. The staff is super friendly and they prepare your order VERY quickly. You can eat here for less than $10 per person and at lunch for less than $7 -- seriously. Why would you ever got to Panda Express when this place is so good and so cheap? If you live near this place it SHOULD be your go-to Chinese restaurant. They also deliver but I'm outside their delivery zone.  The egg drop soup is REALLY good. We've tried: General Tso's Chicken, Orange Chicken, Chicken Chop Suey, Lo Mein, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Sweet & Sour Pork, Chicken Broccoli. All of these dishes were really good. Appetizers are good, but we've only really had the egg rolls.   All things considered I've never had a bad meal or experience here. You should eat here. It's good."}
{"text":"This place is friendly, yummy, clean & close to my home. So this place suits me to a T. The take out is fast & good as well. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I usually get the sesame chicken, sweet and sour chicken or just an order of vegetable fried rice. The specials have a good amount of food for the price. Their customer service is what really makes them amazing. All of the staff are very friendly and polite. They seem to be a family who enjoys their business and their customers."}
{"text":"Great prices, great food. The staff is very friendly... I'll definitely be coming back here for lunch on a more regular basis. I had the kung pao, and the portions were incredible for the $5 I paid.   Not mind blowing, but better than most Chinese places I've been to in the Valley."}
{"text":"We get take out from this place every now and then.  They give great customer service and. The restaurant is very clean and on a scale of 1 to 10 I will give the food a 7."}
{"text":"Love all their food!! Very fresh ingredients and serve it fast and steaming hot. Food looks better in person than in there photos!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, and freshly made. If that wasn't enough he customer service is, hands down, the best in Phoenix! I love going there. The portion sizes are HUGE and it has the best atmosphere. The sushi is fantastic.. I highly recommend the Arizona Roll."}
{"text":"Tried the family meal for $9.95 each and have to say I was impressed. I've not found a great place for Chinese in the west valley but this is currently at the top of our list. We had the wonton soup which was outstanding. We also had Mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken and both were tasty and we enjoyed them.   It's not the best we've ever had but it is the best we've found in the west valley and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Never, ever disappointed. Always clean, friendly, and quick service. Food is hot, fresh, and ready to go when I arrive (I call ahead). I could eat a whole bag of their fried wontons, and be happy. The free eggrolls for checking in is a huge bonus, and one of their lunch specials is big enough, I eat it for TWO lunches. That makes it less than 2.50 per lunch!"}
{"text":"Awesome food but best of all, awesome service! personally I love their hot and sour soup and tomato beef and my family loves their kung pao chicken and orange chicken. They deliver!! great lunch specials!"}
{"text":"New Asian Star is great for a lazy night when we're too tired to even go for takeout. Great prices, good food, very friendly service. Dine in, takeout, or delivery.  If you're not in the delivery zone, call for takeout or even order at the counter - they're fast."}
{"text":"Again best place ever, it's been awhile and they still impress me with their food and service. Thank you"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and great! Super fast delivery. I will definitely order from them again. Thank you"}
{"text":"I know I already wrote a review, but I have to update because I'm SO happy! My last review mentioned that my only issue was their crab puffs because there wasn't enough filling, but we just ordered again this weekend and the crab puffs were packed full! So either we just got a bad batch the first time, or somebody cares to listen. :) Also, tried their egg drop soup which was really tasty and their egg rolls. They have my favorite kind of egg rolls without that weird cinnamon flavor and the extra thin crispy outer shell.  I'm just so happy to have this place so close with such friendly service."}
{"text":"Mediocre, bland, tasteless.  Tried several items and all pretty boring.  The Lo mein tasted errrr didnt taste like anything but boiled noodles with lots of bean sprouts.  Not going back"}
{"text":"So they sent me a note tell me they would investigate. Nothing ever happened!!! FU New Star bad food restaurant....."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a hidden gem, it's nice, clean, great food and excellent service. I ordered the orange chicken and rice and it was crispy chicken with that tangy flavor that I always look for. I'm so used to panda express but now that I found this place I'll be coming over here instead. I've been looking for a good Chinese restaurant and I've finally found it after all these years here in Az."}
{"text":"I've lived in Avondale for 3 years now, but had yet to find a decent, reasonably priced chinese restaurant. I live closer to New Wok, but the prices are too high for the low quality food. I drove 7-8 minutes to New Asian Star, and the service is great. They are very attentive and the food was very good. I was surprised that the orange chicken was not fried, but it was good, nonetheless. I also got a crunchy roll to go, and I had to try a piece when I got home. Very good, great portions for the price. The prices on the lunch menu on here are slightly less than what they actually are. I ordered the orange chicken lunch special, and it was 5.75, not 5.25. This is the best Chinese i've had besides Chen Wok in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Great service, good prices, and it was a nice clean place. The lunch specials for $5 are a great deal. I had the sweet and sour chicken and it was good, just not great. I will be coming back here for lunch in the future."}
{"text":"Good food fat portions . Kool to have Chino food a phone call away. Delivery is quick . Ppl are nice I've eaten in and it's pretty clean and they seem to enjoy there jobs."}
{"text":"The honey walnut shrimp is my favorite!  And the double pan fried noodles come in a close second. This mom and pop place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This place has good service. I called in for delivery and they got my order quickly. I only wish they had explained their pricing for delivery more clearly, cause it's not on the menu what they charge."}
{"text":"Great service, they went above and beyond to cater  a women's event at our church, great food, and to top it off great prices! Thank you so much to the whole staff!"}
{"text":"We love this place and have eaten here a lot don't know why I never checked in before the food is great and the service is awesome they go out of their way to make you feel like your old friends."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a colleague and was definitely impressed.  I must say the customer service here is top notch! Plus the food is great! That explains why it was so busy during the lunch hour.   For lunch, I got the General Tso Chicken. It came with that, soup, rice, egg roll and cream cheese Rangoon... For less than 7 bucks!  I was so impressed. Too bad this place is so far in the west valley, too far from where I am, otherwise I'd be here often!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! Excellent Customer Service, excellent food. Entree Sweet and Sour Chicken, House Fried Rice is all we need for our family of four and we still end up with leftovers. The portions are more than enough. The sweet and sour chicken box will never close all the way because its overflowing with chicken. The food is always piping hot. Just excellent all around. Will never go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Simply AWFUL!!  It smells like a gym & the Beef & Broccoli was disgraceful.  Also, If you enjoy Lo Mein without a hint of flavor, then this is the place for you.  I want my money back!!"}
{"text":"Love their food here. The staff there is  also very kind and polite when taking your order. My delivery orders arrive on time and my food is still nice and hot. Great choices to try are their egg drop soup, sweet and sour pork, sizzling rice soup, and house lo mein! They also give you option of leaving out the onions on the entrees of your choice, which I am very appreciative of."}
{"text":"I love Asian star so much! Their food and costumer service is amazing. This is the only place I got full satisfaction with the sushi and other plates. I always come here when I get the chance because it's that good. I would recommend this place to anyone in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Great place! The service was outstanding and the prices are just right. The portions are even better. I had the orange chicken and it wasn't fried like you normally would get it an it was great."}
{"text":"We ordered huge trays of food for a small party we had, and not one person really enjoyed the food the sweet and sour pork, orange chicken tasted like micowave chicken honestly and i have ate at a few other chinese restaurants where the food tastes like this as well, the price is cheaper but its because of the quality of food.  The staff was pretty friendly though."}
{"text":"Delicious, one of my favorite places to order from. Super fast delivery on the days that I can't make it out of the office. Food is always piping hot and fantastic. Favorites include: pot stickers, egg drop soup, Mongolian beef, garlic chicken, pork fried rice, and any of the lo meins. Actually everything I've ordered there has been a favorite!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in all of Arizona!!! Mongolian beef is phenomenal and service is great. Big portions and a nice dining area with TV. If ordering take out they treat you like you're dining in. Love this place and go as often as I can!!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The delivery can take awhile sometimes but otherwise they are amazing. Order the combination fried rice or the pork egg foo young."}
{"text":"I always order it to be delivered the food gets here quickly. My favorite dish is the salt n pepper shrimp is the best I always order it"}
{"text":"This place is okay. It's fast Asian food so it's ok. They don't put enough egg in the fried rice or offer mixed choices. So I gave them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Love it here! Just across the street from us, the food is yummy and the service is amazing. Def, 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"Really great food but the shrimp tempura roll was excellent!!! The driver was great and very friendly and the rest of food was great but I want more shrimp tempura !!!"}
{"text":"The food is nothing special.  Can get the same quality at most restaurants.  Slightly better than Panda Express.  The service was terrible."}
{"text":"Great service. Tons of food. Many choices. Huge servings. Fast. Friendly. All around good experience. Far from home but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but our dining experience was greatly diminished by the two young children running around and screaming.  The children belonged to a restaurant employee and were completely out of control."}
{"text":"Great quality food at an affordable price. The crab puffs are melt in your mouth good!!!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Went there for the first time yesterday and had their \"happy family\" special, a three course meal for $9.99 per person, minimum 2 people. My boyfriend and I shared the egg drop soup (comes in a huge bowl with a serving spoon, and each person gets their own small individual bowl), a plate of two crab puffs & two egg rolls, and I got the mixed vegetables while he got orange chicken, with fried rice. Everything tasted great... my mixed vegetables had a great white sauce, which I've been searching for ever since I moved to the West Valley, and the fried rice was delicious. Tried some of my the orange chicken sauce (I'm a vegetarian) and it tasted like fresh oranges, with just enough spiciness. I'm looking forward to trying their other dishes. They have a GREAT selection of vegetarian entrees, including orange tofu, which I've never seen at a restaurant before. All of the servers were working together and were super nice... food was brought out quickly... prices were reasonable... portions were large... they even packed up our food for us and wrapped it up in a to go bag. Try this place out, you won't be disappointed! :)"}
{"text":"Not amazing not terrible. I ate here a few times then stopped. This is another spot that is not bad by any means but it is just okay."}
{"text":"You will not find a friendlier staff anywhere in this valley. It is so unusual to find a place with such a great friendly staff. The food, OMG, is awesome! And the prices are with out a doubt the best in town. I hope the Newtimes checks this place out because it will be on their list of 1 of Phoenixs best!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The food is great, the price is great, and the staff is wonderful. It's super close but they also deliver which is nice when you just want to stay in. We are so glad that there is a good Chinese place nearby."}
{"text":"Was expecting better  We were looking for a quick bite to eat and decided to stop in at New Asian Star . The staff at New Asian Star were friendly and it seemed to be a very popular spot with the locals.  On this visit we ordered the lemon chicken, egg drop soup, fried wonton, egg rolls, and chicken with vegetables, we were a little disappointed with both entrée's. The seasoning level was okay, however,  the chicken was overcooked and there was just to much sauce. Next we tried the Eggrolls and Fried Won Tons, once again those items were just okay. Our meals just okay, maybe I was expecting something more.   I love Chinese food however, New Asian Star wouldn't be one of my first choices. But since there is a big selection on the menu, maybe the other entrée's  are better tasting."}
{"text":"Love Love Love New Asian Star !!! Although we live in Los Angeles,CA we frequent AZ to visit family and we always make it a point to visit N.A.S. while we're there.   GET THE TOFU !! OMG, ORDER ITTT !!! Orange Tofu is great, we've gotten the fried as well and it's superb. So far everything we've ordered has been great and the service is always awesome. People here are genuine and really seem to appreciate you coming to THEIR spot to eat. Maybe they are just good actresses but hell, they are great and I have no complaints :) Always feel welcome here!   If you live in AZ and haven't tried this place yet I highly suggest it, and the best part about it is they deliver !!! woohoo !!   Unfortunately not to CA :("}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in west Phoenix.  I love the pork fried rice, the teriyaki chicken, the beef with broccoli, and (my fav) the beef skewers.  And the price is amazing.  Lunch for under $7!"}
{"text":"yummy foods, i know the owner, nice, helpfull ,friendly, anything food yummy, i like this place ,very clean. my house at east mesa so far go to tolleson, but if i and hubby go to  near tolleson, we want visit again. if you vegetarian ,they have too. i recommend this place for any people."}
{"text":"First time I've tried the food here. I got the vegetable fried rice (so good) and egg rolls (more like spring rolls, meh). I will be back for more vegetable fried rice (minus egg rolls) and to try something else. Will update when I do so."}
{"text":"Portion size = 5/5. The portions are always generous. I can usually only finish half of my plate.  Friendliness = 5/5. The staff here are about as kind as they come. They deliver service with a smile everytime, and return to your table several times to check in.   Cleanliness = 5/5. It's always incredibly clean looking in here. I have no doubt the kitchen is just as appealing as the front end.  Appearance = 4/5. Although it's clean, the look of the place is nothing special. It looks new, but it doesn't scream Asian restaurant.   Taste = 4/5. The food is good, no doubt. Good, but not amazing. I'll still be returning to New Asian Star though for all the aforementioned reasons."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and very cheap.  Their orange chicken is really good.  They also have great lunch specials and they deliver.  The service is always fast and friendly.  If you like good Chinese Food at a good price this is the place."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The people here are so great the food is absolutely wonderful... If I could give them 20 stars I would. Salt and pepper shrimp is the bomb."}
{"text":"We discovered this place while shopping in the little strip mall. It's kind of hidden away and small. We went on a Sunday with no wait. The food was pretty good. We ordered the sweet sour chicken,  orange chicken, pork fried rice and egg drop soup it was all good and the prices are about average. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My household orders 3 times a week from here. Delivery, Dine in, carry out.  We're never disappointed. A few times the veggie fried rice was a mishap. Today the lemon chicken didn't come with the lemon sauce. Bo biggey. I'm American I can eat chicken with ketchup but, I hate bickering.  The customer service insisted the lemon sauce was in the Styrofoam. No Ma'am. It wasn't. However, moving along. Everything else was delish including my chicken with my ketchup :). They're always prompt & friendly. Order here & I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Thank you xoxo"}
{"text":"We tried Asian Star for the first time the other day... pickup!  For most part I was delighted!  Very nice on the phone; quick delivery; tasty food; ample portions!  I loved the egg drop soup and the chicken lo mein; I was a bit disappointed with the sweet & sour chicken though... just a matter of preference though (I like the batter to have some crunch, and I felt more veggies would have been nice)!  I will definitely order from them again though, and I definitely recommend them!!!  God Bless!"}
{"text":"After my first time trying this restaurant they have consistently delivered quality food"}
{"text":"It is all Nora V.'s fault that I had to come order from this place!  =)  So after shopping at Target, I had to come get my Asian on!  LOL!  I walked in and placed an order to go: 1.  BBQ Pork - This is from the apps selection:  the bbq sauce to too sweet for my liking 2.  Sesame Chicken - I liked their version, but the chicken could be crispier but then again I got it togo so it was steaming in the container 3.  Beef Chow Fun - This is a good flavorful dish but the chow fun was made with thin flat noodles not the normal flat wide noodles.  Either way, it is was good."}
{"text":"I gave it a 3 star because the workers were very nice and offered me a full refund when I requested my money back. I order Lo mein and got spaghetti noodles with soy sauce. Not what I was expecting or wanted."}
{"text":"it's okay. Good for pickup. The food tastes just like any other chinese food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for freightliner dealership they deliver here fyi. We ordered California rolls and shrimp tempura rolls, pot stickers and egg rolls everything was good. Ordered around 11:30 am so food was great at this time of day can't say about dinner time but there is always next time"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Generous portions, delicious all the way around and friendly staff.  I can't think of a better Asian food place that I've ever been to."}
{"text":"After seeing some good reviews here on Yelp, we thought we would give it a try.  The food has no flavor what so ever.  Dishes seemed to have been cooked seperatly from the sauce or other flavoring spices and then just before it is brought out the sauce it thrown on top of the dish."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. instead of going for the general bland taste they opted for their own. Orderee from them 5 times already amd cant wait to make a 6th."}
{"text":"Was so hungry I almost ate my cat so I decided to order up some food through the app. I went with the spicy general tso's chicken, pork fried rice and egg rolls. Before I knew it my food was at my door, upon receiving it I knew it was made fresh from the extreme heat coming from the bag. I opened it up and begin to indulge like never before. Overall food the food was delicious real happy I didn't go with my first choice."}
{"text":"I've been coming here now for 3 years and have never been disappointed! They are super friendly and helpful. Their delivery speed is impeccable. Every dish I've tried is very well cooked always consistent and always showed signs of a thoughtful chef. And the have the BEST DANG EGG DROP SOUP!!! Its truly fantastic. Sadly I've never ate in the restaurant, either pick up or delivery. But this is definitely a place worthy of your time. Not some second rate place. New Asian star is number 1!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful!  The staff is really friendly and the food is amazing!  My husband, son and I went in and came back a couple weeks later without my son and the lady asked us how our son is!  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Cozy little spot, very good service. The food was brought out hot and cooked perfectly. Don't miss the egg drop soup, it has delicious little bits of poached chicken and the crunchy wontons on top are great. We ordered beef egg foo young, it was fantastic.  The orange chicken spicy and just right. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Dont mean to bash on this place...only saying that the overall rating and reviews had gave us higher expectations.  To be fair all we tried was their Orange n Sesame chicken (came with fried rice), &chow mein."}
{"text":"I've known Lawrence for years, all the way before he owned this restaurant when he worked at another. He's so friendly and I think everyone that comes in can feel that. My favorite items are the hot and sour soup, the honey chicken, and the dumplings. The other food I've tried is pretty good. Definitely love coming here!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese spot! Delicious, and the portion size is perfect for what you spend!"}
{"text":"Orange chicken here is gonna blow your socks right off!  It taste so sweet and has that authentic orange citrus flavor. I ordered the family dinner for 2 and the portions were big enough to feed 3 or four people.  Plus they were so fast that I thought that would hinder the quality and freshness of the food but I was happily wrong!  This is gonna be a top pick for Chinese food in the Tolleson area."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese restaurant. The staff is always kind and friendly and respond quickly to your needs. The deals and combos they have can't be beat and so is worth the extra drive for me. They do deliver but only within a small part of the town they reside. All in all would highly reconmend. The food is always great."}
{"text":"Felt like eating Chinese food and Im not familiar with the area. Read some pretty good reviews and decided to try it.  First impression clean and awesome customer service, was greeted right when we walked in.  Menu has some tasty choices and some good prices. Waiter took our order and shortly after Received our food. Tasted Amazing!!! The orders are pretty good and can easily be shared with someone. They checked on us a couple of times to make sure our food tasted to our liking and to refill our drinks. We will Totally come back to this side of town for some delicious food and great service.  I recommend this to anyone who is in the mood for some good tasting Chinese food.  If your in the area and not familiar and want some good Chinese food check them out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Such delicious Chinese food!!! Never disappoints, and is owned by the most honest and hardworking people ever. I would recommend everyone to come here!! for authentic, affordable, yummy, non greasy Chinese food, this is the place to be. Thank you for the great experience!!"}
{"text":"We like that its close and delivers and love their egg foo yung but will drive to a place farther away next time probably. Got the honey walnut shrimp which came covered in a hot mayonnaise sauce which tasted and felt like eating hot mayonnaise...kinda felt like I might get sick eating it so ended up throwing it out do not recommend that for anyone !"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Lunch specials great. Good fresh and portions are large. Services good and fast. Great lunch place. Was able to take half of my plate home they served so much. Lettuce wraps were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here is really really good :) excellent customer service, great food. Once I tried it I got hooked. I've tried many other Chinese restaurants, this one in my opinion stands out because they care about quality and most importantly their customers. So if you're in the area definetly give them a shot... I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this food!  Mongolian beef, orange chicken,  house lo mein, and crispy crab puffs. Amazing food and I got it delivered and they were wicked fast!"}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Didn't know that this place was here.  Diamond in the rough.   Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is great it's a small Eden restaurant with delivery. The lunch specials have awesome portioning so we always leave with leftovers. The people there are very customer Centric so they ensure that you are happy with your food!!"}
{"text":"We have had the great experience of having them deliver many times to our house. Orders are always hot when the arrive and accurate. We are very pleased with the friendly drivers and timely delivery.  Food has great taste- we have had people in from out of town and they actually have said it's the best they have eaten in a long time! Thank you guys for dropping of the delivery menu at our house, we are glad to have your service!"}
{"text":"This place should be called One Asian Star and that is only because Yelp does not allow no stars.   This by far is the worst food I have had since my last bad review.  WARNING!!  Do NOT waste your money!  Flavorless, dry, cold and unappetizing is what you can expect.  I ordered fried rice and got white rice doused in soy sauce.  Sweet & Sour Chicken was dry dust balls of breading with no chicken.  I could not even chew through it.  I ended up throwing everything away and eating a sandwich.  All I can say is stay away.  There has got to be better places that actually care about providing quality product to paying customers.  This place is not one of them."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorites.  They're friendly,  reasonably priced and the food is always delicious.  My husband and I have tried a number of their items, but my personal favorites are the BBQ pork appetizer, house fried rice, the mushu and lemon chicken.  My husband also loves the house fried rice, the mushu and the orange chicken.  One of the things that is so wonderful about this place is, the food isn't heavy.  The sauces are light and fresh tasting.  Plus, I'm lucky enough to be in their delivery zone.  When I get delivery, the food is still hot and tastes like it was made just a few minutes earlier.  I have yet to be disappointed by anything I've ordered here, and to me, that's a sign of a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Always good! Never fails to satisfy my family and I! Service is good, fast and always friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone craving good Asian food"}
{"text":"I never did get to the food, but when I called to place an order the lady seemed confused. After verifying that they DO deliver to the hotel i'm in, they took my order, then said she wasn't sure about something and kept asking me for the address and phone number. After five times of that I hung it up."}
{"text":"I got a menu for this place in the mail a few weeks ago and kept telling myself that I would try this place.  I got there and was greeted by very happy workers, I was seated and they took my drink order right away.  I looked over the menu and I kept going back to the lunch specials and landing on the Mongolian Beef lunch special.  So I ordered it and was very happy.  The waiter asked which kind of soup I wanted Egg Drop or Hot and Sour so I went with the Hot and Sour and I was very pleased with the texture, flavor and spiciness (not too spicy, just enough to let you know it was there).  Within 15 min. of ordering the beef I got the food.  I picked up the fork and tried the beef strip first and it melted in my mouth.  It was very tender and full of flavor; again just enough spice to let you know it was there and not so hot that you couldn't enjoy the other flavors in the dish.   For me everything that was mixed with the beef was very good and full of flavor.  The fried rice was just a good and flavorful, it even seemed lighter than other fried rice that you get at other places.  Several times throughout the meal they came and asked if I needed anything.  They really look after their customers to make sure you are happy and have everything you need during your meal.  I look forward to eating here again and trying another item on the menu.  I hope this place sticks around and does well.  The food was great and the service was just as good."}
{"text":"I usally love This place there food is great and have great customer service however, I got delivery yesterday ordered kangpou shrimp with no penuts and to me it seemed they put in Extra penuts very very disappointing. I also orders there house chow mein and got some type of wide noodle though it wasn't bad it was not what I ordered"}
{"text":"Solid authentic Asian food.  I normally get the general tso chicken.  As hot as they will make it but have tried a few other dishes including the orange chicken and the chicken fried rice.  Delivery is typically on time and very friendly. This is my go to for Asian take out at home."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Ordering me some house tried rice and potstickers while I watch the Cardinals play."}
{"text":"love this spot. so convenient since I'm less than a block away and the family that runs it are very friendly and a pleasure to order from. their food never disappoints and they have great lunch specials during the week. too bad I'm always working in California and can't enjoy it"}
{"text":"I love the freshness of their dishes and their soups have all been delightful. I usually order Chicken Fried Rice and the War Wonton Soup (hold the wontons). The fried rice is seasoned well, piping hot, and has nice cuts of chicken breasts. The War Wonton soup is a clear broth soup with chicken, shrimp, carrots, snow peas, mushrooms, broccoli, zucchini, and green onions. The omission of the wontons are just a personal preference; I'm just not a fan. However, I also make sure to get a side of the crispy wonton strips to top off my soup ( =\ they charge 50 cents for the crispies). I love this place and will continue to frequent here a couple times a month."}
{"text":"We always take ours meal to go. But everything we have tried so far is amazing. The honey walnut shrimp is my favorite item."}
{"text":"First time customer... I had their Kung Pao Chicken delivered with some rice sides and I was not disappointed they were so friendly and food was delivered very quickly... The food was amazing super fresh and hot.. new favorite delivery"}
{"text":"Affordable and tasty that delivers.  Can't go wrong there or so we thought. Pretty much love everything on the menu but the teriyaki chicken.  A household favorite that New Asian Star has managed to turn into a tasteless pile of meat.  My suggestion is go somewhere else for Teriyaki. If you are not looking for Teriyaki this place is for you."}
{"text":"OK, so this place isn't the great Chinese food of big city locations.  It's a small, hole in the wall location in Tolleson that is good.  It's down the street, delivers in a timely manner with no comment on my bed head or pajamas.  My favorite is their potstickers.  The sauce it comes with is delish.  We, as a family, love the House Fried Rice, all of the soups, and crab puffs.  Okay...not the biggest fan of the crab puffs because they are a little sweet but it they are still good.    If you order online and stick to the favorites you will be golden.  They are listed as favorites for a reason."}
{"text":"We usually go to Asian blossom but wanted to try something different since the lunch special was very affordable. We got about 4 plates of takeout and it was the worst Chinese food ever. I don't know it it was just the cook that day but it was just awful. I almost went back to return it but decided it was too much of a hassle. The chow mein was made with linguini pasta and it just had way too much onion. I hope for their sake that they just had a new cook that day but as for me, I'm not giving this place a try ever gain."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here tonight. I was not expecting too much from the strip mall restaurant but was pleasantly surprised. The food was very good! Ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the beef and broccoli combo meals. Hot and sour soup was delicious. Everything was fresh and very tasty. Very affordable with fast, friendly service. Will definately go back!"}
{"text":"Move over Red Dragon! We have a new favorite in town! This seasamee chicken is so tender! I'm sold! Its made to order too! Dinner combo comes with rice, crab puff, and egg roll. Bomb! We'll be back...plus its on the way home! Score!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have made this our weekly go-to place for dinner. We've tried almost everything and have not been disappointed. I absolutely LOVE their General Tso chicken wings. Absolutely perfect.  Aside from the food, what keeps us coming back is the staff. They are very attentive and friendly. It's a family ran restaurant and they go out of their way to make sure you well taken care of.  It's apparent that their client base is mostly repeat customers since they seem to know almost everyone that walks through their doors. That says a lot about their food and their service. This place is the real deal."}
{"text":"their food is always fresh and very good. customer service is five stars as well. and never had a problem with timely deliver or the order being messed up. thanks for being around my block!"}
{"text":"This place sucks I just tried to place an order for deliver and because I'm just outside their \"delivery area\" they wouldn't deliver to my house.  To be specific their southeastern delivery border is 75th Ave and southern and I live at 75th Ave baseline and I'm only 12 minutes from the place and 6.8 miles from them.  What great customer service!!"}
{"text":"This cafe has excellent food. We took 12 people. Everyone had tons of fantastic food with plenty to take home. It was only $92! Every dish was delicious and piled high. The waitress was always very helpful and bent over backwards to make our time there comfortable. We definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite and got the egg drop soup, beef egg foo young and orange chicken. The soup and orange chicken were pretty good. The egg foo young wasn't bad but there wasn't much flavor in the egg part.   Also, while I don't mind when someone has their kids hanging out while they're working, I know the struggle of being a working parent, it'd be nice to have them somewhat reigned in. I lost count of how many times we almost got hit by the stuff they were playing with and they were charging around our table like a tiny herd of buffalo."}
{"text":"Was very highly rated. Quality has severely deteriorated. Used to be one of my favorites. I had curried shrimp with fried rice. The curry had very little flavor and was waterie. The majority of the dish was large chunks of water chestnuts and onion. Their fried rice was nothing more than white rice that they sprinkled soy sauce on. (Some of it wasn't even colored.) My wife had the mongolion chicken. Flavor was passable. Nothing great; but it had much more flavor than mine. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"The food and services is on point. The two brothers along with the entire staff is efficient. Their Singapore rice noodle with shrimp & beef is very good along with their Mongolian beef. My ultimate favorite is their Asian wings and tomato beef, you won't be disappointed.  They even service sushi! Always hot and fresh, their portions are huge on their dinner combo, be sure to go in hungry."}
{"text":"This place has one of the most friendliest staff! I usually come her to dine in. The service is fast and the food is tasty! I like how they give free soup when you dine in. The price of the meal and the serving is a great deal! They will also customize meals for you if you want to take something in/out or have the meat cooked a certain way like from another dish they have. It's a nice and quiet spot.  Today, I actually called in for pick up. I only ordered soup cuz I'm sick. But the person who answered the phone was so friendly and understanding. He had asked if I was sick then he said that he was sick last week...and that there must be something going around. And before the conversation ended he said I hope you feel better. =)  I just love friendly people! And on top of that...they got good food. I'll be back...soon!"}
{"text":"The place is okay. I always get their Singapore rice noodles with shrimp, chicken, pork, and some vegetables. It's good I think with this place it might depend on the time you order; because there were times when the food was a costly disappointment. Their fried rice is really brown and isn't all that flavorful and the orange chicken is okay. Probably would order when they first open and avoid nights, especially before closing time and calling the order in."}
{"text":"The food was so good and fresh. We got sweet and sour chicken, twice cooked pork-medium, pork fried rice, vegetable lo mein, spring rolls and an avacado roll. Highly recommend each. We have finally found our go to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I really appreciate the food ere. It is quality. I come from the east valley and hasn't found decent Chinese food on the west valley till this restaurant arrived."}
{"text":"This place I like for its General Tso's chicken, egg foo young, and their mu shu. I haven't tried their other plates simple 'cause I found what I like and I'm happy with it. Their staff is always friendly and every once in a while when I go there near closing time I get free soup or rice or egg rolls. Lately I've noticed they are taking longer and longer to deliver but I give them a break since they only have one guy doing all the deliveries and they get swamped some days."}
{"text":"I do not understand all the high ratings. I just spent $50 on delivery and I threw it all in the trash!!!! BBQ pork?? It was so dried out it was tree bark consistency! Shrimp with lobster sauce? How about disgusting SMALL shrimp in a slimy gray sauce with undercooked vegetables  House fried rice... tasteless!!! The sliced beef actually tasted \"off\" like it had gone bad. The shrimp were the same small ones as used in the shrimp and lobster sauce, and it was all blaaaaaand. Wor Wonton soup with.. broccoli????? Uncooked zucchini?? Where on earth did these people learn how to make wonton soup?? I'm from NYC and have lived in AZ and California and never have I seen or tasted anything so gross.   Seriously everything was so disgusting I'd call to demand a refund if I wasn't so pissed off. I don't want to get more upset when I'm refused the refund!  Sorry, if you know what decent American Chinese food tastes like, this ain't it."}
{"text":"I've honestly only had the sushi from this place. But, the rolls are well priced and very delicious. There is the standard California and tempura shrimp roll, but the real gem is the Arizona roll. It is fried, for the health conscious, but if you're looking for healthy eats at a \"Chinese\" restaurant, you're going to have a bad time. Eat everything same day, like any other Chinese place."}
{"text":"The staff was really nice greeted us as soon as we walked in. It is a small place so I imagine if it's busy there would be a wait to be seated.. We came in time we got to sit right away. The egg drop soup was hot and good. My family ordered sweet and sour chicken orange chicken and kung pao chicken which were all good...   The servings are good you get a lot of food for the price. Everything was hot and fast. It's a little bit out of our way but we would come back. It's definitely a lot better than a lot of places out there."}
{"text":"Great service every time I go in and great food! The orange chicken is one of the best iv ever had!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving Chinese take today, and we found this place on yelp. We decided to really go for it. We ordered house fried rice, house lo mien, general tsao's chicken, orange chicken, pot stickers, egg rolls. Our chicken came with steamed rice as well. The chicken was pretty dry; on both dishes. The house fried rice and the house lo mien was pretty good though. The general tsao's chicken also does not live up to the description of being spicy; it was actually kind of sweet, but still tasty(minus the dryness). The eggrolls were slight burnt on the edges, but once you get past that it was really good!! My boyfriend really liked the pot stickers! We have tons of left over, which is great. It was pretty much what you would expect from mediocre Chinese food."}
